                   DISREGARD OF PROTOCOL BY MR M MALAKOENA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B THOMSON: Chairperson, I hereby move the following notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the complete disregard for protocol  displayed  by
       the hon Mandla Malakoena, the chairperson of the Portfolio  Committee
       on  Transport  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  when  he  unofficially  opened   a
       multimillion rand project in Ladysmith over the weekend;


  (2) notes that there was no arrangement between the MEC for Transport and
       the Chairperson for the hon Malakoena  to  unveil  this  multimillion
       rand project;


  (3) believes that official responsibilities such as this one fall  within
       the domain of the MEC for Transport or a delegated  official  in  the
       absence of the MEC; and


  (4) therefore calls  on  the  IFP  to  look  into  the  conduct  of  this
       particular member so as to preserve the cordial  political  relations
       that exist between the ANC and the IFP.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I oppose the motion.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You oppose  the  motion?  Well,  in  the
light of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with.  It  will  now
become a notice of motion.

             CONGRATULATIONS TO FREE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev  M  CHABAKU:  With   due   respect   to   the   honourable   House   ...
[Interjections.]  Nifuna  ukungithakatha?  [Do  you  want  to  bewitch  me?]
[Laughter.]

Chairperson, I beg to move this motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Free State Department of Health for the top honours
       which they scored  in  a  national  competition  to  acknowledge  the
       creativity  and  innovation  of  organisations  in  the  delivery  of
       service;


  (2) commends this department  on  winning  the  second  position  in  the
       category  "Improving  Efficiency  of  Internal  Processes  of  Public
       Service  Delivery"  at  a  recent  function  addressed  by   Minister
       Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi;


  (3)  notes  that  they  received  a  crystal  trophy  and   a   financial
       sponsorship; and


  (4) therefore urges this department to continue  to  pursue  their  Batho
       Pele policy as we seek better health for all.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       Umphakathi awuvikelwe ezilwaneni eziyingozi kubantu.
(Translation of isiZulu draft resolution follows.)


  [That the Council -


  (1) is surprised at the  shocking  incident  committed  by  a  baboon  in
       Madipelesa in the North West province last week, when a baboon walked
       into a house at midday and took a three-month-old baby  boy  and  ran
       off with him and eventually cracked open his skull and ate his  brain
       in front of his helpless mother;


  (2) is surprised at this incident: even when  the  mother  of  the  child
       tried to make the baboon leave the baby  alone,  the  baboon  reacted
       violently, and wanted to hurt the  mother  of  the  baby,  who  cried
       loudly until the neighbours came over, but the  baboon  continued  to
       react in that way;


  (3) is shocked to hear that the baboon just climbed over the fence, where
       it ate the brain and then ran into the bush, leaving the baby dead;


  (4) appeals to the authorities  at  the  national  parks  to  take  steps
       quickly to prevent the movement of these cruel animals outside of the
       parks so that the same tragedy does not happen again - it is  a  very
       shocking incident; and


  (5) greatly sympathises with the family and relatives  involved  in  this
       tragedy, especially the mother of the child, who witnessed her  child
       being eaten while not being able to do anything to help  him.  People
       must be protected against these dangerous animals.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                             (Review of policy)

Vote No 16 - Health:
The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Chairperson and hon  members,  may  I  single
out my colleagues from the provinces - the MECs as well - because  occasions
such as this budget debate are a powerful reminder that the  spirit  of  co-
operative governance is the lifeblood of our  national  health  system.  The
people's contract for a better South Africa starts here. It starts with  the
national Government, provinces and local government, remaining steadfast  in
our pledge to work together to improve the lives of all  our  people.  I  am
honoured, therefore, to present to you the Budget Vote on Health.

Of the total amount of R8,38 billion in the national Health budget, no  less
than R7,32 billion is transferred to provinces as conditional grants.  These
grants are targeted at tertiary services in central  hospitals  and  certain
regional hospitals, training of  health  care  professionals,  the  HIV/Aids
programme,  the  Hospital  Revitalisation  Programme  and   the   Integrated
Nutrition Programme.

Resource constraints remain an ever-present reality in the operation of  our
health services. We have  seen  respectable,  nominal  increases  in  health
spending for several years now. However, when these increases  are  adjusted
for inflation and for population growth, we are spending only a little  more
on the health of each individual than we were in the mid-90s. Of course,  we
are trying to do a great deal more with this  money,  including  confronting
the major  communicable  and  noncommunicable  diseases,  and  some  obvious
pressures on resources are emerging, even in our better-off provinces.

We have also committed ourselves to levelling the uneven playing field  that
apartheid left behind. Whilst the gap in per  capita  spending  between  the
wealthier urban provinces and the poorer rural  provinces  continues  to  be
narrowed,  this  gap  has  not  been  eradicated  and,  of  course,  remains
unacceptably wide. This year the budget per  capita  spending  in  provinces
ranges from approximately R1 670 at the top of the scale to a low of R630.

This pattern of inequity is also  reflected  in  large  disparities  in  the
number  of  health  professionals  available  in  the   various   provinces.
Therefore, hon members, in order to discharge your oversight  responsibility
and stewardship role over national resources, I am appealing to you  to  pay
special attention to three things: the overall pressure on resources in  the
public health sector; the manner in  which  resources  are  allocated  among
provinces and among the  different  districts  in  every  province  and  the
manner in which  health  care  resources  are  utilised  by  provinces,  and
opportunities to target services to ensure that they  reach  the  needy  and
most vulnerable individuals in our communities.

The national Budget this year has some  strong,  positive  features  in  the
areas  of  capital  spending,  nutrition,  HIV/Aids  programmes  and   human
resources.  However,  we  will  only  reap  the  benefit  of  these  special
allocations  if  provincial  funding  of  the  health  system  is  basically
adequate and sustainable. Let me illustrate this point in  relation  to  the
area of human resources.

The budget this year includes a special allocation of R500 million in  order
to assist provinces to recruit and retain health professionals to  serve  in
rural areas and to boost the levels of  scarce  professions  in  the  public
sector. The R500 million will introduce a system of  allowances  and,  in  a
few categories, pay increases.  These  will  top  up  the  salaries  already
covered in provincial budgets for the year, but  will  not  fund  additional
posts. We expect that  the  new  allowances  will  have  a  real  impact  in
returning skilled health workers, especially in  rural  areas,  as  well  as
attracting  additional  professionals  to  fill   vacancies,   and   special
attention will be paid to sweetening the package in the most remote areas.

Presently we  have  2  662  young  professionals  doing  community  service,
contributing critically needed services in the public sector. For  instance,
one out of seven doctors in the public sector  is  doing  community  service
and  so  are  about  one  out  of  four  pharmacists  and  one  out  of  two
physiotherapists. These figures confirm the incredible  value  of  community
service to our nation. By investing  effort  to  nurture  community  service
professionals, we can make it worth their while to spend a  few  more  years
in the public sector. Several new categories  of  mid-level  health  workers
have been approved by the professions council and they will help  fill  some
gaps in human resources.

Given  the  intense  public  debate  on  the  international   brain   drain,
information in the recent Intergovernmental Fiscal Review might  come  as  a
surprise to many. The review reveals that between the end of 2001 and  early
2003, provincial  health  departments  actually  recorded  a  4,5%  gain  in
doctors, while the loss of professional nurses  amounted  to  a  mere  0,5%.
Again, these oppose the suggestions of the media.

Of course, the review merely records the bottom line. It does  not  tell  us
much about the turnover that might be happening  under  the  surface.  Those
who are familiar with the public health service will tell  you  that  people
are not only leaving the service,  but  we  are  also  gaining  some  health
professionals who used to work in the private sector.

We have consistently taken the view that we have no  wish  to  restrict  the
freedom of health workers to work abroad. We are concerned,  however,  about
the exploitative recruiting tactics of certain international operatives.  We
also believe that the international movement of health workers can  to  some
extent  be  managed  to  the  mutual  benefit  of  the  countries  and   the
individuals involved.

I returned just a week ago from the World Health Assembly in  Geneva,  where
Commonwealth health Ministers adopted a  code  of  ethics  on  international
recruitment of health workers, which is now binding on  all  member  states.
South Africa intends to  build  on  this  foundation  by  seeking  bilateral
agreements with Australia, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. We have  already
had extremely fruitful talks and discussions with my colleague  in  Britain,
the Minister of health. The team, led by the  director-general,  will  visit
the United Kingdom this month to pursue discussions on this subject.

The high point of the assembly this year was the unanimous adoption  of  the
Framework Convention on Tobacco  Control,  which  sets  the  scene  for  the
global expansion of public health measures against tobacco, such as  control
in advertising, sponsorship and smoking in public places.

Since returning from Geneva we have  released  the  results  of  our  second
Youth Tobacco Survey  undertaken  by  the  Medical  Research  Council.  This
showed a very clear reduction over a period of three years in the number  of
teenagers who  recalled  seeing  tobacco  advertising  and  a  corresponding
decrease in the percentage who  have  ever  smoked.  We  feel  confident  in
claiming that this is directly due to our  laws  and  regulations  that  ban
tobacco  advertising  and  our  tax  on  tobacco  products  that   make   it
increasingly costly to smoke.

The  need  for  strong,  multifaceted  health  promotion   initiatives   was
highlighted by another  major  discussion  at  the  World  Health  Assembly,
namely responding to the global epidemic of violence. Last  year  the  World
Health Organisation published a major study on violence as a  public  health
issue. The key message of the study was that we are  not  powerless  in  the
face of violence. It is possible to understand the roots of violence and  to
take a range of actions to address the diverse causes.

Specialised centres for assisting survivors  of  sexual  assault  have  been
created in some provinces. Gauteng currently has 26 such clinics, while  the
Northern Cape has established similar services in six towns,  with  outreach
into surrounding communities. The Free State, KwaZulu-Natal,  Northern  Cape
and Western Cape have taken the lead in training forensic  nurses.  We  have
donor funding to extend  this  training  nationally  and  we  are  currently
creating a standard curriculum for training forensic nurses.

There is little doubt that public awareness of women and child  abusers  has
increased hundredfold over the last  few  years  and  that  many  Government
sectors, including health, have played a key role in this. But the time  has
come to dig deeper  into  the  methods  of  prevention  and  to  expand  our
conception of programmes against violence  to  acknowledge  that  adult  men
constitute a major category of victims. In recent years nearly half  of  all
deaths among young men in the age group 15 to 29 years are due to  unnatural
causes, suicide, homicide and accidents. So, you can see  that  the  problem
of violence is certainly bigger than we thought a few years ago.

The expansion of our mental  health  services,  with  a  stronger  community
focus, is undoubtedly critical to  tackling  violence  effectively.  Several
provinces have made specific financial provision this year for  implementing
the new Mental Health Care Act by  expanding  community-based  services  and
appointing  boards  to  assist  in  protecting  the  rights  of  individuals
admitted to psychiatric institutions. All provinces have  retained  a  clear
focus on the objectives of our national programme to  reduce  mortality  and
morbidity.

The integrated management of childhood illnesses was slow  to  get  off  the
ground, but it  is  consolidating  quite  well.  It  has  the  advantage  of
providing nurses with a clear framework for dealing with a  whole  range  of
childhood illnesses. Preliminary evaluation  suggests  that  it  results  in
more appropriate use of medicines, appropriate referral at  an  early  stage
and better involvement of the care-giver. The integrated approach  will,  in
the long term, impact on  immunisation  levels.  However,  there  are  still
large  variations  among  provinces   and   low   immunisation   rates   are
particularly disturbing when they coincide with the re-emergence  of  severe
malnutrition and high rates of diarrhoeal diseases.

Provincial plans across the board include  a  major  focus  on  TB  control.
There has been some soul-searching about how we get  better  TB  cure  rates
from the Directly Observed Treatment Strategy, Dots,  and  turn  around  the
rising incidence of this disease. The result in a number of  provinces  will
be seen in  greater  investment  in  the  management  of  TB  programmes  at
district level  and  intensified  recruitment  of  treatment  supporters  in
communities. We are planning much stronger public awareness and  information
campaigns  in  order  to  achieve  earlier  diagnosis  of  tuberculosis,   a
reduction in stigma and a climate more  favourable  for  the  completion  of
treatment. I would like all members of this Council to participate  actively
in the TB advocacy programme.

In  relation  to  HIV/Aids  and  sexually  transmitted  infections,  we  can
confidently say there is a steady build-up of the elements of our  five-year
strategy plan. For the second consecutive year there is a major increase  in
the budget for this  programme.  This  year's  allocation  in  the  national
Health budget alone is up to more than R200  million  and  amounts  to  R666
million.

Provinces are the major beneficiaries of this increase, the  bulk  of  which
goes into a single conditional grant which can be  allocated  to  particular
services that the provinces judge most appropriate. In 2002 the major  areas
of progress in most provinces were renewed  strategies  for  preventing  HIV
infection among the youth; the expansion  of  the  PMTCT  programmes  across
provinces; the introduction of AZT and 3TC  for  sexual  assault  survivors;
step-down facilities, an additional element  in  the  treatment  chain;  the
expansion of voluntary counselling and testing development in  the  area  of
home-based care and the mass media campaigns accompanied by targeted  social
mobilisation under the slogan Khomanani - Caring Together.
The number of facilities involved in the PMTCT programme has  increased.  We
are following the mother-baby pairs to determine the  impact  of  nevirapine
when used for PMTCT. We  are  also  committed  to  monitoring  adverse  drug
events as well as resistance patterns due to a single  dose  of  nevirapine.
All provinces are offering AZT and  3TC  to  survivors  of  sexual  assault,
using the national guidelines in administering the medication as part  of  a
comprehensive service.

The development of a trained body of care-givers is a major feature  of  the
HIV/Aids and TB programmes. These care-givers are  known  by  various  names
and are skilled in  different  areas  such  as  counselling,  support,  home
nursing and outreach to families in need. Collectively they have become  the
engine for the continued roll-out of a range of services. I  would  like  to
recognise  their  singular  importance  here  today  and  salute  them   for
responding with love and dedication to the health care needs of our people.

We are committed to  continually  reviewing  and  evaluating  our  five-year
strategic plan on HIV/Aids. In the year  ahead,  further  expansion  of  the
HIV/Aids programmes within the five-year strategic plan can be expected.  As
you know, the Department of  Health  and  National  Treasury  established  a
joint task team to examine and cost various options  for  strengthening  the
national strategic plan on HIV and Aids, and  in  particular  the  treatment
available to people living with HIV and Aids.  May  I  also  add  that  this
includes nutrition. This report will be  dealt  with  by  the  Cabinet  very
soon.

Among other strategies we will be strengthening the following  key  elements
of our comprehensive national response to HIV and  Aids.  There  will  be  a
greater focus on nutrition, food  supplementation  and  the  use  of  immune
boosters in order to encourage positive living  and  delay  the  progression
from HIV to Aids.

We are working with the Departments of Agriculture  and  Social  Development
to provide social support to those who are infected and affected by HIV  and
Aids. The Medical Research Council has established, as a first step, a  unit
on indigenous knowledge systems to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of
traditional herbal remedies. And the results are quite promising.

Turning to the area of non-communicable diseases, we  have  seen  growth  in
capacity in certain specific  areas  and  dedicated  funding  for  assistive
devices for people with disabilities is  now  routinely  allocated  in  most
provincial budgets. As a national department, we  have  committed  ourselves
to clearing the backlog of devices by this time next year at  a  total  cost
of R30 million. This would then allow the provinces to  focus  on  replacing
devices and assisting new cases.

We need to take a careful look  at  the  World  Health  Organisation's  2002
study on health risks, a study that concluded  that  40%  of  the  mortality
disease burden must be laid at the door of 10 major  risks.  We  have  taken
bold and seemingly successful steps to reduce the risk of  tobacco.  Now  we
need to look at some of the other major risks, such as  nutrition,  obesity,
alcohol, unsafe water and inadequate sanitation. Perhaps we need  to  recall
that this year marks the 25th anniversary of the Alma Ata  Declaration,  the
cornerstone of primary health care. We will be commemorating this  event  in
South Africa.

The development of the  health  infrastructure  on  which  these  programmes
depend remains a  continual  challenge.  As  you  know,  the  Inkosi  Albert
Luthuli Hospital was commissioned last year, the Nelson Mandela  complex  in
Umtata is due to be opened later this year and 2004 will see the opening  of
the new Pretoria Academic Hospital.

In the last two years, funding for  our  Hospital  Revitalisation  Programme
has taken a great leap forward. We have R717 million in the budget and  this
will be increased by almost R200 million in  the  year  2004.  Presently  we
have 26 hospitals on our list and 18 of these projects involve the  building
of entirely new facilities, either to replace the existing hospitals  or  to
create a new service.

The revitalisation  of  hospitals  is  as  follows:  In  the  Eastern  Cape:
Frontier, St Elizabeth and Mary  Theresa;  in  the  Free  State:  Boitumelo,
Trompsburg and Ladybrand; in Gauteng: Mamelodi,  Johannesburg,  Johannesburg
South  and  Natalspruit;  in  KwaZulu-Natal:  King  George,   KwaMashu   and
Empangeni; in Limpopo: Lebowakgomo, Jane Furse and Lekhomo - I  think  I  am
correct; in Mpumalanga:  Piet  Retief,  Themba  and  Rob  Ferreira;  in  the
Northern Cape: Colesberg, Calvinia and Kimberley  Psychiatric  Hospital;  in
North West: Vryburg, Tswaraganou, and in  the  Western  Cape:  Eben  Dönges,
George and others.
Hospital revitalisation also involves technology,  maintenance,  replacement
and innovation, as well  as  the  development  of  managers  and  management
systems and improving quality of care. In addition to the boosted funds  for
the revitalisation programme there has also been an increase in funding  for
infrastructure as part of  the  equitable  share.  Provinces  are  currently
using such funding to sustain the process of  upgrading  and  expanding  the
network of clinics and community health centres  to  increase  the  pace  of
replacing obsolete equipment and to undertake  similar  renovation  projects
and routine maintenance. Systematic audits of  hospital  equipment  revealed
that shortages were often caused not by a lack of equipment, but by lack  of
maintenance and excessive down-time on existing equipment.

We have an acute shortage of specialised engineers and  technicians  in  our
public health system to keep our  equipment  in  good  repair  and  we  have
developed a dual strategy to tackle this critical factor. We plan  to  train
500 engineers and technicians over a period of five years,  with  the  first
100 commencing training in the next two months. As an  interim  measure,  we
have  reached  agreement  with  the  Cuban  government  for  engineers   and
technicians to work in South Africa on short-term contracts  and  the  first
group will arrive pretty soon.

A further priority in the area  ahead  is  the  strengthening  of  emergency
services with the eventual  target  of  meeting  a  standard  set  of  norms
countrywide. We fully recognise that  many  other  services  are  critically
dependent on the support of an effective ambulance fleet  with  well-trained
personnel. Other significant measures to strengthen  support  services  will
occur in relation to laboratory services and medico-legal mortuaries.

A major pillar of our strategy to reshape the public health care  system  is
the  building  of  health  districts  with  strong  local  co-ordination  of
services and equally strong local accountability. The national health  Bill,
which will be tabled this year, will recognise  the  constitutional  reality
that provinces are designated as the  primary  providers  of  public  health
services. Local government  will  only  become  a  significant  provider  of
public health care through  co-operative  governance  arrangements.  We  are
exploring the use of  service-legal  agreements  with  local  government  to
deliver  specified  services  on  behalf  of  the  province  with   adequate
resources.
Clearly, this is not a  simple  system.  It  is  a  system  that  should  be
informed by commitment to the ideal of decentralised management  to  improve
efficiency  and  effectiveness  and  it   should   promote   people-centered
development through greater  community  participation  in  the  delivery  of
basic services.

There may also be significant benefits  to  the  approach  in  the  area  of
equity. If the gap between  the  richest  and  poorest  provinces  is  still
unacceptably large, the gap between the richest and  poorest  municipalities
is even larger and more worrying. If funds  for  primary  health  care  flow
through the provinces to local councils, this can help to level the  playing
field between the municipal areas. It can also strengthen the  co-ordination
of health services.

I referred in passing to the national health Bill and I am  pleased  to  say
that the state law adviser has now certified the Bill. This  means  it  will
soon be tabled for processing by Parliament. We  anticipate  there  will  be
high levels of interest in the Bill and we look to this Council to  play  an
active role in channelling public input. The  traditional  healers  Bill  is
also likely to be of particular interest to the  provincial  constituencies,
especially where provinces already have legislation on related matters.

The increasing interface with the private health sector  is  another  factor
that is gradually having a bearing  on  provincial  health  services.  Those
provinces that are using the uniform patient fee schedule quite  widely  and
have set revenue targets have reported achieving or exceeding their  targets
last year. Clearly, there  is  still  untapped  opportunity  for  generating
revenue for our public hospitals.

Changes in the medical schemes legislation which allow schemes to  designate
preferred service providers represent a significant opportunity  for  public
hospitals to increase the proportion of paying patients. Many hospitals  are
preparing for these arrangements.

I can assure this Council that this new development will not compromise  our
responsibility to ensure care for those who cannot afford to pay their  way,
and paying patients will not be allowed to crowd out  our  poorer  patients.
The revenue generated by fee-paying patients will benefit the service  as  a
whole and the quality of clinical  care  provided  in  provincial  hospitals
will not depend on whether patients pay or not.

In closing I would like to thank the Select  Committee  on  Social  Services
and especially the chairperson, the hon Loretta Jacobus,  for  her  guidance
and constructive interaction with  me  and  members  of  the  Department  of
Health. I would like to recognise Deputy Minister Schoeman who has taken  up
the challenge of entering office late into the  term  and  has  strengthened
the Ministry by focusing on particular aspects of our complex department.

I would like to recognise my ministerial colleagues in the  social  services
cluster and in Cabinet and pay tribute especially to the leadership  of  our
President, President Thabo Mbeki, and my  provincial  colleagues,  the  MECs
for health, our  partners  in  the  exercise  of  concurrent  powers.  I  am
indebted to them for sharing the responsibility  of  decision-making.  In  a
similar vein, I thank the Director-General of the Department of  Health,  Dr
Ayanda  Ntsaluba,  and  his  counterparts  in  the  provinces,   for   their
dedication and leadership.

I also wish to recognise  the  support  received  from  my  advisers,  other
members of my office and senior officials in the Department of  Health.  But
when it comes down to it, the health service is run  by  a  huge  number  of
health workers, professional and non-professional, who give  it  their  best
effort, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year, and on behalf  of  the  millions
who benefit from your skills and your love for your work,  I  thank  all  of
you. Thank you very much, Chair. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Thank you, Chairperson. I think  I  need  protection  from  my
colleagues on this side of the House here.

Hon  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  Deputy  Minister,  MECs,  special
delegates and members, I think I must also commend  all  the  MECs  we  have
here. We have eight out of the nine provinces represented here.  [Applause.]
I think this debate is probably one of the best attended  by  the  political
heads of provinces when we have our policy debates.

It is, indeed, once more a pleasure for me to  rise  in  support  of  Budget
Vote No 16, the Vote on Health. It is also of  significance  that  in  this,
the ninth year of our democracy, we rise to applaud our  achievements,  but,
in doing so, we do not lose sight of the challenges that  still  lie  ahead,
as we move into celebrating the first decade of our freedom  from  apartheid
service delivery.

In preparing for this debate, our select committee decided to  embark  on  a
day-long interaction with provinces,  where  we  looked  at  basically  four
areas. First, we looked at provincial priorities; we looked at the  spending
patterns of provinces; we looked at programmes aimed  at  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty and, last but not least, the challenges  faced  by  all
the provinces.

By and large, the provincial priorities correspond to that of  the  national
Department of Health, as set out in the  department's  strategic  plan  over
the next three years, up to 2006. In looking at the  spending  patterns,  we
used as a guide the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review that was tabled  in  the
NCOP about two months ago. The Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  notes  that
provincial health budgets rise significantly in the current  financial  year
in order to strengthen the health sector, in particular, and to intensify  a
range of specific programmes.
These  include  substantial  funding  increases,   especially   for   health
services, in previously disadvantaged  provinces;  large  increases  in  the
Hospital Revitalisation Programme; increases for  the  Integrated  Nutrition
Programme, as also mentioned by the Minister; the further  strengthening  of
the enhanced response to the HIV and  Aids  strategy,  and  a  R500  million
increase to R1  billion  additional  funding  for  a  new  system  of  rural
incentives and a scarce skills strategy for the health sector.

It is also encouraging to note that provincial health spending continues  to
show strong growth over  the  MTEF  period.  Strong  growth  going  forwards
specifically applies to some of the most disadvantaged provinces.  For  this
financial year, the health budget for Mpumalanga has  grown  by  22,7%,  for
the Northern Cape by 22,1%, for the North West by 20,9% and for the  Eastern
Cape by 16,9%.

Needless  to  say,  these  increases  create  the  basis   for   substantial
improvements in health services. For a breakdown of  figures  for  all  nine
provinces, I refer members to table  5.1  in  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review, which I hope members are familiar  with  at  this  point.  Provinces
have also received substantial additions to their baseline  health  budgets.
These have grown by 4,5% in real terms for this financial year.

No one can argue with the fact that access to a quality service  also  means
access  to  a  decent,  well-equipped  physical  structure.  We,  therefore,
applaud the increased health capital expenditure, which  has  tripled  since
1999. The improvement in expenditure on the  hospital  revitalisation  grant
has been a key factor in the turnaround in capital expenditure.  This  grant
targets the funding of large  strategic  revitalisation  projects,  such  as
upgrading, replacement and transformation of  hospitals  and  clinics.  This
grant increases to over R1 billion in the 2005-06 financial year.

Some key projects  have  been  finalised  or  are  nearing  completion,  for
example, the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal and the  Nelson
Mandela Hospital in the Eastern Cape are completed,  and  so  is  the  first
phase of the Pretoria Academic Hospital in Gauteng.

In a bid to fight child poverty, the Department of Health has been  stepping
up its Integrated Nutrition Programme. Funding for the Integrated  Nutrition
Programme has been increased to over R1 billion in the outer  years  of  the
MTEF for  2005-06,  as  part  of  Government's  anti-poverty  strategy.  The
increases are intended to reach out to  a  larger  number  of  children  and
schools, providing meals for at least 156 school  days  in  a  year  in  all
provinces.  A  steady  increase  is  reflected  in   table   5.21   of   the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review to just over R1 billion in  the  outer  year
of the MTEF.

However, the challenge still remains: What  happens  in  the  remaining  109
days of the year, when kids are not at school? The  Departments  of  Health,
Education and Social Development need to put their  heads  together  to  try
and address this problem, because not all of these children are  in  receipt
of a social security grant.

One of the thrusts of the 2003-2004 budget  is  a  further  step-up  in  the
enhanced response to the HIV/Aids strategy.  There's  been  an  increase  in
earmarked funding and this will rise to about R1,8  billion  in  2004-05  to
support various preventative interventions.

Starting in this financial year, a further R3,3 billion  will  be  added  to
provincial allocations to be spent on Government's enhanced response to  HIV
and Aids over the  MTEF  period.  These  increases  take  into  account  the
additional costs arising from hospitalisation  for  Aids-related  illnesses,
the treatment of  opportunistic  infections  and  TB,  and  for  progressive
strengthening  of  medically  appropriate  treatment  programmes  over  this
period.

Having said this, I want to come to some of the  challenges  that  we  face,
and I want to briefly touch on some  of  these  as  they  emerged  from  the
hearings that we had.  Other  members  of  the  committee  and  the  special
delegates from the various provinces will probably go into more  detail  and
elaborate more on the challenges that they are facing in their provinces.

I've highlighted three main challenges. One  is  human  resources,  and  the
Minister touched on that as well; secondly, the  discrepancies  in  the  per
capita  spending,  which  the  Minister  also  touched  on,   and   thirdly,
interdepartmental and intergovernmental collaboration.

Regarding human resources, reflecting on the vision of  the  department,  it
is said, and I quote:
  ... to play a role in securing a caring and humane society in  which  all
  South Africans have access to affordable and good quality health care.

The issue of human resources cannot be overemphasised. Needless to say,  the
more rural provinces bear the brunt of this challenge. The vacancy  rate  of
health workers, which is nurses, doctors and  other  medical  professionals,
in the rural areas of the Northern Cape currently stands  at  30%.  We  were
informed to this effect during the hearings.

The doctor-to-patient ratio in the  North  West  province  is  1:3  300  per
population. The active poaching and recruitment by other  countries  of  our
health workers adds fuel to the fire. I'm therefore  happy  to  have  learnt
that the Department of Health has concluded, of course in co-operation  with
the relevant stakeholders, an incentives  package  aimed  at  retaining  our
health workers or, at least, binding them into a  commitment  to  return  to
the service of the department on their return  from  the  so-called  greener
pastures. A shortage of human resource capacity also impacts  negatively  on
service delivery and, indeed, the quality of service  that  is  rendered  to
our people. I am also happy  to  note  that  the  Minister,  in  her  input,
mentioned  a  protocol  or  agreement  that  was  signed  to  address   this
particular problem.

On the issue of the inequality in per capita spending, I refer the House  to
table 5.3 of the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  that  reflects  on  per
capita spending per province. I won't go into the details of that,  save  to
say that Gauteng and the Western Cape, again, top the list with the  highest
per capita spending, while Mpumalanga, the  Eastern  Cape,  North  West  and
Limpopo are at the bottom of the list currently, and will remain there  over
the MTEF period.

I still need to be satisfactorily informed about what  informs  the  varying
per capita spending.  I  asked  this  question  when  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review was tabled with the Select Committee on Finance in the NCOP.

Various research and the personal experience of many of us sitting  in  this
House inform us that the majority  of  people  living  in  rural  areas  are
either unemployed, have a very minimal income or depend on  a  social  grant
for their survival. Research also further informs us that  the  majority  of
households in rural areas do not have access to some of the basic  services,
like clean drinking water, sanitation, balanced nutrition and  so  on.  This
whole scenario does not bode well for the health of any individual.

The deduction I make from this is that most rural dwellers  are  more  prone
or susceptible to diseases of poverty and other ailments. My  common  sense,
therefore, tells me that health spending in rural provinces should,  at  the
very least, be equal to health spending on our fellow South Africans in  the
urban areas.

Regarding  interdepartmental  and   intergovernmental   collaboration,   the
Minister, the director-general and most of  the  senior  officials  who  are
seated over there are medical doctors. They can  attest  to  the  fact  that
ensuring a healthy nation is not the sole responsibility of  the  Department
of Health.

Other   Government   departments   like   Education,   Social   Development,
Agriculture, Housing, Transport, Sport and  Recreation,  Water  Affairs  and
others all have a significant role to  play  in  promoting  and  ensuring  a
healthy nation. A more significant role  should  also  be  played  by  Local
Government in the delivery  of  healthy  services,  and  the  Minister  also
alluded to that.

Between 1999 and the beginning of 2000, the  Health  Systems  Trust  invited
the select committee on a tour  to  KwaZulu-Natal,  where  we  visited  some
clinics and hospitals in the area. There was  one  clinic  in  KwaZulu-Natal
that we went to visit and, unfortunately, it had rained the day  before  and
the clinic was completely inaccessible. We couldn't get  there.  We  had  to
park our bus on the side of the road and ask the management  of  the  clinic
to come and meet us on the side of the road.

The Minister can have a state-of-the-art clinic  anywhere  in  the  country,
but if it's inaccessible, that clinic or hospital will  not  mean  anything.
So, Local Government really has a particular role to play, as well,  in  the
provision and maintenance of roads in our country.

The Minister of Social Development, some time ago, commissioned a  study  on
a comprehensive social security system. The report of this study was  tabled
in March 2002. It's called the Taylor Commission Report.  Included  in  this
report is a chapter on health and recommendations on the role of  health  in
the development of a comprehensive  social  security  system.  I  think  the
Minister must be familiar with that report and the  particular  chapter  I'm
referring to, but I, once again, want to point the Minister to that  chapter
and its recommendations for her and her department's consideration.

Irrespective of what many people might think, the Taylor  Commission  Report
does not only deal with the basic income  grant,  as  many  people  want  to
believe. It deals with a whole range of issues.

I want to quote from the statement of the director-general in the  Strategic
Plan for the National Department of Health, 2003-06. This is what he had  to
say, and I quote:


  There are multiple determinants of health status. This reality means that
  we  have  to  work  closely  with  other   Government   departments   and
  nongovernmental stakeholders to improve the health status of our country.




  One key mediating factor is that the delivery of health  services,  given
  that health is also a concurrent national and provincial function, is the
  need for the national department to work closely with  provincial  health
  departments.

Needless to  say,  I  agree  wholeheartedly  with  this  statement,  and  it
supports what I said earlier on.

In conclusion, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the  Minister  and
the Deputy Minister, who sat with us  during  the  provincial  hearings.  In
fact, I hijacked him from his lunch to come and participate and sit with  us
during our hearings, to hear what the provinces had to say. He agreed to  be
hijacked, yes. I thank the department, led by  Dr  Ntsaluba,  the  director-
general, and all his staff as well as all the  provinces  for  the  constant
support. That support is evident in the  presence  of  the  political  heads
here today.

I thank everyone for the support,  assistance  and  guidance  given  to  the
committee over the past year but, in particular,  in  preparation  for  this
debate, and we hope that this support will continue for  the  new  committee
that will be appointed after the elections next year. Some of  us  might  be
here and some of us might not be here.

Thanks also go to the staff assisting  the  committee,  including  Johannes,
the parliamentary liaison officer - who I don't see here - who always  keeps
the department in touch with us and us in touch with the department.

Last, but not least, we'd also  like  to  salute  the  thousands  of  health
workers and health professionals who  tirelessly  work  in  service  of  our
people and who uphold the principle of Batho Pele, irrespective of what  the
conditions are that they find themselves in.

Together we can and  will  build  a  better  life  for  all.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Hon Minister, Deputy Minister,  MECs  and  colleagues,  Deputy
Chair, today I wear a little white heart on my coat and I wear  and  display
it with pride.

This white heart is the emblem of the International Council of  Nurses.  The
ICN launched the white heart on International Nurses Day in May  1999  as  a
universal  symbol  for  nursing.  The  symbol  characterises   the   caring,
knowledge and humanity that infuses the work  and  spirit  of  nursing.  The
white heart is also a unifying symbol for nurses globally.

Herewith, I salute all the nurses of my country,  but  especially  those  in
the Eastern Cape, in the deep and rural areas, where they  work  under  very
difficult conditions, sometimes only with the  basic  necessities  and  many
times even without that. It was one of these nurses who once had to hitch  a
lift for a seriously ill patient. There was no ambulance or other  transport
available.

Those people, hon Minister, are the backbone of your department,  and  thank
you for mentioning them in your speech. It is not those learned  and  clever
people heading the departments but those who work and deliver for  the  love
of people that are the backbone of the sector.

Of the millions  of  words  written  about  Winston  Churchill,  Lady  Diana
Cooper's are among the most revealing. She wrote: ``When  I  said  the  best
thing he had done was to give the people courage,  Churchill  answered,  ``I
never gave them courage; I was able to focus theirs''.

Hon Minister, if you can focus the courage of your medical  staff  in  South
Africa, you will have done a great job for this country.

The  health  worker  is  struggling  under  difficult  circumstances.  Their
workload  is  enormous;  their  support  systems  are  lacking.   With   the
escalating crime, we must look at their safety and see to  the  security  of
the facilities.

The Eastern Cape covers 169 580 square kilometres. A  vast  area,  you  must
agree. To give you some sense of the inequities and scarcity  of  particular
professional groups in the Eastern Cape, I want to mention  a  few  details.
One doctor in the Eastern Cape must serve  a  public  sector  population  of
8 825, compared to Gauteng where one  serves  273.  One  professional  nurse
must serve 1 278 people; in Gauteng it's 606.  One  dentist  serves  190 117
patients; in Gauteng it's 25 000, and one pharmacist  in  the  Eastern  Cape
serves 53 662 compared to 18 994 in Gauteng.

These are but a few examples to illustrate the statement on the workload  of
doctors  and  nurses.  If  we  look   at   more   specialised   areas   like
physiotherapists,  occupational  therapists  and  speech   therapists,   the
figures are mind-boggling. For example, there is one therapist  for  950 530
people - that's nearly a million people.

In all these categories mentioned, the Eastern Cape is by far the worst  off
of all the provinces. The only exception seems to be the medical  specialist
ratio. Limpopo and Mpumalanga are worse off than  the  Eastern  Cape.  These
three provinces also have the lowest expenditure in out-of-hospital  primary
health care services. There is a great reliance  on  district  hospitals  to
deliver primary health care.

Maar, agb Voorsitter, ons het simpatie en empatie met  die  Departement  van
Gesondheid in die Oos-Kaap, veral die oostelike area en verafgeleë  gebiede.
Soos aangedui, is hierdie 'n  uitgestrekte  provinsie  en  daar  is  werklik
probleme met die infrastruktuur. My vraag en bekommernis  is  egter,  hoekom
laat ons toe dat  hospitale  en  gesondheidsdienste  en  klinieke  wat  100%
effektief was en in  werkende  orde  was,  nou  oneffektief  en  in  sommige
gevalle gesluit word? Daar is gevalle van  sogenaamde  gesondheidsinrigtings
wat  sodanig  verswak  het  dat  dit   byna   beskryf   kan   word   as   'n
gesondheidsgevaar.
Kom ons sorg dat hospitale skoon is, dat beddegoed  voldoende  is  dat  daar
kos vir die pasiënte is. Agb Ondervoorsitter, hierdie hospitale  is  nie  in
die verre Transkei en Ciskei nie, hierdie hospitale  sal  jy  in  en  rondom
Port Elizabeth kry.

Ons verstaan dat die Oos-Kaap 'n agterstand het, maar wat  die  publiek  nie
verstaan nie, is  dat  hierdie  staatshospitale  'n  goeie  advertensie  vir
gesondheidsdienste was. Ons was almal trots op hierdie  instellings  en  nou
ontbreek selfs die basiese beginsel van  netheid  en  reinheid  vir  hierdie
hospitale.

Die mees basiese medisyne kan nie voorsien word  aan  pasiënte  by  klinieke
nie. Hierdie is nie klinieke in verafgeleë gebiede nie - ek  praat  van  die
klinieke waar daar infrastruktuur en  kommunikasiemiddels  is.  Dis  in  die
westelike Oos-Kaap.

Ons is besig om ons gesondheidswerkers, veral die  draers  van  hierdie  wit
hartjie, te demoraliseer. Hulle entoesiasme  en  liefde  vir  hul  professie
word hulle ontneem omdat hulle nie die siekes se pyn kan verlig  nie;  omdat
hulle nie die eed wat hulle afgelê het, gestand kan doen nie.
Agb Minister, daarom is u  besig  om  die  ruggraat  van  u  departement  te
verloor. Dokters en verpleegsters gaan soek  groener  weivelde,  nie  soseer
oor die groter salarisse nie, maar  waar  hulle  ten  minste  dít  kan  doen
waarvoor hulle opgelei is.

As ons visie dan 'n beter primêre gesondheidsdiens  is,  laat  ons  dan  ten
minste eerste die  primêre  dinge  van  gesondheid  regstel.  Laat  ons  ons
prioriteite regkry. Die armste  provinsies  moet  gehelp  word  om  meer  te
spandeer op primêre gesondheid.  Dit  is  hier  waar  die  mense  finansiële
bystand die nodigste het wanneer hulle siek is. Dis hier waar  die  grootste
impak gemaak kan word teen armoede. Ek dank u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But, hon Chairperson, we have sympathy and empathy with the  department  of
health in the Eastern Cape, especially the eastern area  and  remote  areas.
As indicated, this is a large province and there are  really  problems  with
the infrastructure. My question and concern, however, is: why  do  we  allow
hospitals and health services and clinics that were 100%  effective  and  in
working order, now to become ineffective and in some  cases  to  be  closed?
There are cases of so-called health institutions that have  deteriorated  to
such an extent that they can almost be described as a health hazard.

Let us see to it that hospitals are clean, that there is adequate linen  and
that  there  is  food  for  the  patients.  Hon  Deputy  Chairperson,  these
hospitals are not in the far distant Transkei  and  Ciskei,  you  will  find
these hospitals in and around Port Elizabeth.

We understand that the Eastern Cape has a backlog, but what the public  does
not understand is that these state hospitals were a good  advertisement  for
health services. We were all proud of these institutions and  now  even  the
basic  principles  of  tidiness  and  cleanliness  are  lacking   in   these
hospitals.

The most basic medicine cannot be provided to  patients  at  clinics.  These
are not clinics in distant areas - I am talking of the clinics  where  there
are infrastructure and means of  communication.  They  are  in  the  western
parts of the Eastern Cape.

We are demoralising our  health  workers,  especially  those  who  wear  the
little white heart. They are being deprived of their enthusiasm and love  in
their profession because  they  cannot  alleviate  the  pain  of  the  sick;
because they cannot honour the oath they took.

Hon  Minister,  for  that  reason  you  are  losing  the  backbone  of  your
department. Doctors and nurses are going in search of greener pastures,  not
necessarily for the sake of larger salaries, but to go  where  they  can  at
least do that for which they were trained.

If our vision is a better primary health  service,  let  us  then  at  least
first of  all  rectify  the  primary  things  of  health.  Let  us  get  our
priorities right. The poorest provinces must be  helped  to  spend  more  on
primary health. This is where the people  are  most  in  need  of  financial
assistance when they are sick. This is where the biggest impact can be  made
against poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Dr M B GOQWANA (Eastern Cape): Thank you, hon Deputy Chair. Firstly, I  want
to honestly apologise for walking in not knowing the proceedings were on.  I
apologise. It is probably because we do not have  rooms  like  this  in  the
Eastern Cape. [Laughter.]
I just want to tell you about the Eastern Cape  firstly.  The  Eastern  Cape
occupies about 13,9% of the country's earth surface and the Eastern Cape  is
one of the rural provinces. As you know, about 36% of it is  urban  and  63%
is rural.

Let me quickly just talk about the statistics, especially those relating  to
children, women and TB so that you can see what is actually happening.  When
I talk about the challenges  and  our  priorities,  they  are  going  to  be
related to what I'm going to mention now.

Our infant mortality rate in the Eastern Cape  is  61,2  per  thousand  live
births and is the highest in the country. This  is  related  mainly  to  the
diarrhoeal diseases, malnutrition, the communicable diseases  that  are  not
supposed to be  there,  HIV/Aids,  and  tuberculosis.  Even  though  we  are
primarily a rural area and poverty-stricken, we still share with  the  other
provinces the car accidents and  the  injuries  at  birth  that  affect  the
mortality of the infants.

On the issue of women's health in the Eastern Cape, at the moment  we  stand
at 133 maternal deaths per  100 000,  and  32%  of  these  are  primigravida
patients. Surveys have shown that  some  of  these  patients  actually  have
problems with HIV/Aids.

Regarding TB, we have seen an increase in the TB statistics  in  the  recent
past, and this is probably related to the fact that we  are  reaching  areas
where there used to be no primary health care. Now we are  able  to  collect
patients that were never known to have TB. They were  dying  in  silence  in
those areas. This is what has led to our statistics increasing and,  partly,
it is because we got the HIV/Aids pandemic affecting  us.  In  most  of  our
hospitals, 10,2% of admissions are related to TB.

Our major challenges in the Eastern Cape are the escalating  TB  prevalence;
the brain drain that we have, with doctors and  nurses  who  are  moving  to
other countries; the low rate of immunisation in the Eastern Cape;  some  of
the cultural factors like the circumcision problems  that  we  have  in  the
Eastern Cape; the high infant mortality rate, and maternal mortality.  These
are some of the challenges that we have.

In the light of escalating crime in  some  areas  that  is  related  to  our
health professionals, in the Eastern Cape two  nurses  have  been  raped  at
work, but that situation has been corrected in the sense that  we  have  now
got security in those institutions. This is related to  the  fact  that  the
community does not realise and does not respect what is actually being  done
by Government to improve their health status.

The increase in motor  vehicle  accidents  has  an  impact  on  our  medical
services  in  the  Eastern  Cape  and  the  backlog  in  health   facilities
development.

Our priorities, mainly, are to make sure that we contain HIV/Aids,  that  we
control the spread of  TB  and  that  we  control  the  spread  of  sexually
transmitted infections. We want to reduce the  infant  and  child  mortality
rates. We want to  increase  our  immunisation  rate.  We  want  to  control
communicable diseases. We want  to  develop  the  district  system  and  the
delivery package of primary health care. We want to  improve  our  emergency
services. The Eastern Cape, as I mentioned, occupies  13%  of  the  land  of
South Africa. That makes it one  of  the  provinces  that  are  very  large.
Unlike some of the provinces that are bigger than  the  Eastern  Cape,  each
and every corner of the Eastern  Cape  is  occupied  by  people.  There  are
people that are staying there and, in this sense, we  definitely  need  good
emergency services that are going to be able to cater for all  those  people
that are in those areas.

We would like to improve  our  logistical  and  other  support  services  to
implement the Hospital Revitalisation  Programme  to  improve  capacity  and
access to regional and tertiary services in the  province,  and  to  develop
human resources for quality and management of the services.

We have eight programmes that we are using  to  make  sure  that  we  render
proper health care services in the Eastern  Cape.  I  am  not  going  to  go
through them, but I just want to mention  that  the  budget  that  we  have,
which has increased from the budget that we had,  for  next  year  is  about
R5,1 billion. We are very happy that it has  been  increased  from  what  it
was. We think that we are going to be able to  handle  most  of  the  things
that we could not handle with the smaller budget that we had.

I am sure that you have heard that it is an increase of  16%,  up  from  the
previous year's budget, so I do not have to repeat that. Over  68%  of  that
budget will go to personnel, but I am not going to dwell that.

Let me just talk briefly about expenditure. The money that we are using  for
the districts and subdistricts amounts to R2,2 billion. It  is  an  increase
of 5% on the previous year's budget and the budget on HIV/Aids  goes  up  to
R71 million, which is a 33% increase from the previous year.  The  nutrition
programme has increased by 51% and has gone up to R172 million.

We are trying to render our services through the local authorities, but  not
the whole province is actually using local authorities  for  primary  health
care services. It  is  only  in  certain  areas  that  we  are  using  local
authorities for primary health services. The money that we are giving  them,
which has increased from last year to this year by 6%, is  R134 million.  We
are still using provincially aided hospitals. There are 18  of  them.  There
are reasons why we are still keeping them. We are  giving  them  R70 million
to make sure that they run the services in  those  particular  institutions.
We are still using life care hospitals and we are  giving  them  R94 million
and we still have SANTA hospitals that we give R74 million to.

The expenditure per capita in the Eastern  Cape  is  at  R634  and  that  is
excluding the conditional grants. Obviously, I do need to  mention  that  it
is lower than some of the provinces. Regarding the  conditional  grants,  we
have got the national  tertiary  services  grant,  which  has  increased  to
R145 million; the health profession training and  research  grant  which  is
R88 million, and has decreased slightly; the HIV/Aids  grant  -  as  I  have
mentioned, it has increased; the  hospital  revitalisation  grant  which  is
standing at R109 million, and the Integrated Nutrition  Programme,  which  I
just mentioned, as well as the hospital management improvement grant,  which
is at R9 million.

I just want to talk briefly about  what  we  are  doing  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. We are working on HIV/Aids  programmes  where  we  are
improving the access to VCT by increasing the number  of  testing  sites  by
30%; implementing post-exposure facilities  for  rape  survivors;  expanding
our PMTCT programme; improving care and support for the people infected  and
affected by HIV/Aids, and  increasing  community  involvement  in  HIV/Aids,
which we are doing through the HIV/Aids Council. We are  providing  services
to vulnerable groups like the community sex  workers.  We  are  providing  a
continuum of quality  care  through  the  provision  of  step-down  care  in
designated hospitals. We have set up centres of  excellence  in  partnership
with  medical  schools  to  provide  models  of  prevention,  treatment  and
research.

On the issue of TB programmes, we are improving our monitoring of  the  drug
supply to the  areas  where  we  are  treating  people  with  TB.  There  is
increased case detection by smear microscopy among all TB suspects  to  80%.
We have improved the MDR programme, that is,  the  Multiple  Drug  Resistant
programme. We have  also  decreased  treatment  interruption,  expanded  the
Directly Observed Treatment Short Course,  and  finalised  the  TB  advocacy
plan for the Eastern Cape.

In reference  to  the  reduction  of  the  infant  mortality  rate,  we  are
increasing our immunisation coverage to 85% in  2005-06.  We  have  improved
access to ordinary health care facilities, and the prevention of  mother-to-
child-transmission of HIV/Aids. There is the  management  and  follow-up  on
children with HIV/Aids,  and  implementation  of  integrated  management  of
childhood diseases.

Regarding integrated nutrition, we are intensifying  the  implementation  of
the Integrated Nutrition Programme, as guided by UNICEF,  in  terms  of  the
conceptual framework and the triple approach. We  are  promoting  community-
based growth monitoring and strengthening nutrition interventions at  health
facilities  and  community  levels,  and  have  rehabilitated   malnourished
children to  work  with  other  sectors  in  detecting  the  root  cause  of
malnutrition and poverty, and facilitated the  transfer  of  primary  school
nutrition to the Department of Education.

One other challenge which we mentioned was the  brain  drain.  Here  we  are
actually developing incentives which, I am sure, some of  the  members  here
might not know about. We have got incentives for nurses in the  rural  areas
to make sure that we  understand  the  commitment  that  they  are  actually
putting in. We have the provision of accommodation  for  doctors;  induction
programmes for community service staff and interns; the creation  of  senior
posts, promotion of doctors to higher posts and making sure that  there  are
training courses in some of  the  smaller  hospitals;  filling  of  critical
posts using utilisation of grants to  attract  and  retain  staff,  and  the
intense marketing of the province.

In terms of the reduction  of  maternal  morbidity  and  mortality,  we  are
increasing the level of  reporting  and  surveillance  of  maternal  deaths,
implementing maternal  health  guidelines,  increasing  access  to  maternal
services and expanding top services. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms E D  PETERS  (Northern  Cape):  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy
Minister, my colleagues from the provinces, and members of the NCOP, I  just
wanted to say today that, like the hon Gouws, I believe we are  all  wearing
the little white hearts, but as MECs for health, that little white heart  is
one we wear day and night. Even in our sleep, we dream about the  conditions
under which our nurses  work.  We  strongly  believe  that  nurses  are  the
backbone of our health services. Without them, we would not be where we  are
and we would not be able to deliver the services. [Applause.]

I just want to say to the hon chairperson of the committee that  I  was  bit
disappointed when she said that they had requested  the  management  of  the
clinic to get to them, instead of taking that  extra  step  to  get  to  the
management and the nurses  and  to  understand  that,  irrespective  of  the
conditions, and irrespective of the deserted Northern Cape - even  if  there
is a group of twenty people somewhere - we  have  to  get  the  services  to
them, my hon colleague from the Free State ...  not  from  the  Free  State,
sorry, but from the Eastern Cape.

The budget that the  hon  national  Minister  has  just  tabled  here  today
reflects  the  unwavering  commitment  of  this  Government  to  ending  the
suffering of our people, especially as a  result  of  lack  of  health  care
services. This budget will instil a sense of hope in  many  of  our  people,
especially those residing in deep rural areas. It complements the good  work
that we are doing at provincial level and is much welcomed.

The Northern Cape is a province at work, irrespective of  the  small  number
of people that we have there. We are at work to restore the dignity  of  our
people through the provision of  quality  and  accessible  public  services,
including health care services. To sustain  this  progressive  programme  of
bringing health care services closer  to  our  people  as  a  province,  the
equitable allocation to the department  of  health  was  increased.  If  you
listen to the amount, you may  think  that  that  amount  cannot  deliver  a
quality service, but it has. We had R488 062 million, and it  has  increased
to R564 818 million, which is an increase for our province of about 15,73%.
The conditional grant allocation is also increased from R110 152 million  to
R171 694 million, an increase of about 55,9%. I do not know whether that  is
an indication of a motion  of  confidence  about  how  we  can  utilise  the
conditional grants.

This  large  increase  in  the  conditional  grant  is  attributed  to   the
substantial increase in the allocation of two  conditional  grants,  namely,
the Integrated Nutrition Programme and the  Hospital  Revitalisation  Grant.
These grants were increased by more than 100% each in the 2003-04  financial
year as compared to the previous year.

In line with  the  budget  reforms  instituted  by  National  Treasury,  the
programmes of the Department of Health  in  our  province  have  changed  in
order to be aligned with areas of service delivery.  This  has  resulted  in
the  number  of  programmes  increasing  from  five  to  seven.  The  budget
allocation programme is as follows: administration,  5,2%;  district  health
services, 46,4%;  emergency  medical  services,  6,3%;  provincial  hospital
services, 30,1%; health sciences, 1,9%; health care support services,  0,8%,
and health facility management, 9,3%.

In line with this allocation, our provincial  health  priorities  relate  to
infrastructure development.  As  the  Minister  indicated,  we  are  in  the
process of building the psychiatric hospital for the year  2004-05,  and  we
are busy, for the same year,  on  the  Gordonia  hospital  project,  and  we
envisage building a totally new provincial  hospital  to  replace  Kimberley
Hospital. You will understand that Kimberley Hospital functions as  a  level
1, 2 and 3 hospital. For the Frances Baart district, there  is  no  level  1
facility and therefore there is confusion about  the  level  that  Kimberley
Hospital actually functions at.

We are  also  in  the  process,  in  partnership  with  the  Nelson  Mandela
Foundation, of building the Garies Hospital, which will commence  in  August
2003. We are also going to build five new clinics. When you  hear  what  our
budget is, you will understand why our figure for the  building  of  clinics
might not compare with Gauteng, hon Gouws. We  are  going  to  be  upgrading
five clinics to make them modern and so that  they  are  accessible  to  the
communities.

We have also been given a donation of four container clinics by the Gift  of
the Givers Foundation from KwaZulu-Natal, which  is  helping  us  to  get  a
facility to communities that still have a tree stump as a clinic, where  the
mobile services get to a community and  stand  under  a  tree  in  order  to
deliver services in the rural areas. That is one of our key focal points  in
infrastructure development.

We are also going to strengthen our primary health  care  services.  We  are
also ensuring that, in  the  process,  we  are  going  to  deal  with  human
resource development. I am going to refer to this document,  because  it  is
very important for me to be able to give you the full details on  our  human
resource management plan.

We are in the process of finalising our job  descriptions  for  the  various
categories, and implementing a performance appraisal in that arena.  We  are
strengthening our primary health care clinics, especially  in  rural  areas,
and  improving  the  availability  of  doctors  and  nurses.  An   important
challenge for the  department  has  been  the  recruitment,  production  and
retention of particularly nurses as an essential human resource.

In this regard, a range of initiatives have been undertaken, and others  are
being contemplated. With respect to the training of professional nurses,  we
have increased the  intake  at  the  college.  Two  years  ago,  the  select
committee challenged us to put our money where our mouths  are,  because  we
complained about a lack of personnel and yet our intake at the  college  did
not reflect that. We are determined to increase the number of nurses in  our
college. In that year, we had an intake of 20  students  per  annum  in  the
nursing college, and in the ensuing year we increased  that  number  to  39.
This year, we have increased the number threefold to 60. These students  are
also expected to sign a four-year contract to work  in  the  province  after
qualifying.

Professional nurse numbers are  also  being  increased  through  a  bridging
programme for enrolled staff nurses. These nurses live  in  rural  areas  in
the province, and  return  there  after  completing  their  training.  Nurse
numbers are also increased by the appointment of general assistants,  clerks
and porters in nursing assistant training posts. They are  then  trained  as
nursing assistants. This programme also ensures career  pathing  of  various
categories of people in the health care field.

In an attempt to  curb  the  uncontrolled  emigration  of  nurses,  we  have
introduced a nurse scholarship programme  in  conjunction  with  the  Oxford
Radcliffe Hospital in the United Kingdom. Fourteen nurses left  to  work  in
this hospital in August 2002 and returned in January 2003. A  second  cohort
of 16 left on 14 January 2003.  We  will  also  be  implementing  the  rural
allowance scheme for nurses from July 2003.

The other programme that is a priority of the province relates  to  forensic
services. The taking over  of  medico-legal  mortuaries  from  SAPS  by  the
department of health is in progress. The recruitment and  appointment  of  a
forensic pathologist will be pursued. The department utilises  the  services
of  medical  practitioners  to  assist  with  post-mortems  in  areas   very
distantly located in the province.

The other programme is the telemedicine project. You would understand,  with
the province being so vast, that we need this type of  facility  or  project
to succeed in our province. The telemedicine  project  has  been  evaluated.
Rolling out poses certain challenges that will require further  preparation.
The ultrasound equipment will have to be more widely available. During  2002
and 2003, we will begin to  equip  13  level  1  hospitals  with  ultrasound
machines in order to roll out that type of project.
We are also in the process of creating permanent doctors' posts  which  will
ensure continuity and will create the conditions for  the  roll-out  of  the
programme.

Regarding gender mainstreaming, which is also one  of  our  key  programmes,
ensuring the advancement  of  women  into  decision-making  positions,  this
objective is currently being addressed in that the gender  focal  person  is
sitting in on all departmental recruitment interviews,  appointments,  study
loans and scholarships, especially in strategic positions, to ensure  gender
equality and balance. A target of at least 50% of women in senior  positions
is aimed at by the year 2005.

The successful implementation of these identified priority  programmes  will
ensure and speed up the delivery of quality health care services to all  our
people.

During his state of the nation address, the  hon  President,  Comrade  Thabo
Mbeki, reminded us of the people's contract for a better life. The  Minister
said that it starts here in this Chamber where  provinces  are  represented.
The President challenged us to push back the frontiers of poverty  in  order
to deliver on this contract.
Central to our departmental programme  of  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, teaching and training ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Nk J N VILAKAZI:  Sihlalo  ohloniphekile.  Ngqongqoshe  womnyango  wezempilo

Kudingeka kakhulu ukuba kuvalwe  lo  mgudu  owenziwa  ukuhamba  kwezisebenzi

Okokuqala nje, uma ngicaphuna  enkulumeni  kaMhlonishwa  uNgqongqoshe  uthi:
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister and the House, in your  budget  speech
we heard that you have allocated R8 million and more and it is  the  biggest
budget in all  sections  of  your  department.  It  should  be  so,  and  we
appreciate that. Life should come first, nothing can happen  if  people  are
sick.

The bad thing, which does not sound good in your department, is the  leaving
of experienced health professionals for other countries. It is good  because
they do not hide the fact  that  they  leave  our  country.  This  route  of
experienced health professionals leaving the country should be closed;  they
leave because it only benefits other countries.

Firstly, and I quote the hon Minister, where she said in her speech:]


  A significant portion of the budget will be used to consolidate  existing
  programmes. However, I would like to highlight  a  notable,  new  feature
  that is the  special  allocation  to  attract  and  retain  the  valuable
  services of skilled health professionals.

Kuhle  kakhulu  lokhu   okushiwo   uNgqongqoshe,   futhi   kungafezeka   uma
ukwaneliseka  kwezisebenzi  kulo  mnyango   kuqala   laphaya   besaqeqeshwa,
belolongwa, bephekwa ukuze babe yilokhu  esithanda  babe  yikhona.  Ababuzwe
ubumnandi    bokuthandwa    nokunakekelwa,     nokukhuseleka     emsebenzini
abawufundelayo, bangafisi ukuwela baye kwamanye  amazwe  anamathuba  angcono
nemali phela.

Sengathi izitshudeni ezifundela ubudokotela, umkhakha phela  esishoda  ngawo
kangaka eNingizimu Afrika azinakho lokhu kukhuseleka. Abanazo ngisho  izinto
zokuhamba   ezibahambisa    ezikhungweni    ngokomsebenzi    abawufundelayo,
bayazibonela njengechwane lenyoka,  bagibele  amatekisi,  izitimela  nokunye
nokunye,  bese  kuthi-ke  laba  abazalwa  ngongxiwankulu  ababevele   bebusa
bahambe  ngezimoto  zabo.   Izitshudeni   ezifundela   ubudokotela   neminye
imisebenzi aziphumi emakhaya ongxiwankulu, ziyahlupheka.

Siyawubonga  uMnyango  wezeMpilo  ngokubanika   imifundaze.   KwaZulu-Natali
bahamba  phambili  ngemifundaze.  Siyabonga  Ngqongqoshe   womnyango   ngale
mifundaze,  sengathi  lunganda  lolu  sizo  kubantwana  bethu  abaludingayo.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[What the hon Minister is saying sounds very nice, and can be  fulfilled  if
the satisfying of health professionals starts when these  people  are  still
being trained so that they will become what we want  them  to  become.  They
should feel the joy  of  being  loved  and  cared  for  and  also  of  being
protected in the work they they are trained to do, so  that  they  will  not
desire to go overseas to find greener pastures.

It looks as if the students who are training to  be  doctors,  a  career  in
which we are greatly  lacking  here  in  South  Africa,  do  not  have  this
security. They do not even  have  transport  that  will  take  them  to  the
hospitals in which they are getting some of their  training.  They  have  to
see how they can get there. They  use  taxis,  trains  and  other  modes  of
transport. But those who  come  from  rich  families  use  their  own  cars.
Students who are training to be doctors and students in  related  fields  do
not come from rich families, they are poor.

We would like to thank the Department of Health for giving them  some  study
loans. In KwaZulu-Natal they are number one in giving study loans  to  these
students. We would like to thank  the  hon  Minister  for  these  loans  and
bursaries. We wish this assistance to our children to be extended.]

My great  concern  here  is  the  lack  of  security  our  medical  students
experience while they are training for such a wonderful career  in  an  area
in which South Africa has a great need. No official transport  is  allocated
or provided for their  use  when  visiting  areas  of  tuition,  whether  in
townships or suburbs or other hospitals. They have  to  rely  on  their  own
transport. They  feel  neglected  and  insecure,  especially  those  of  our
children from previously disadvantaged communities.  Day  in  and  day  out,
they suffer torment, while their counterparts from well-to-do  families  use
their cars for such trips. This leaves much to be desired.  Certainly  these
students, once they have completed their training, will  leave  the  country
for better pastures abroad.

Zolo lokhu eKhayelitsha, khona lapha eKapa kubulawe  unogada,  abahlengikazi
bayesaba  ukuqhubeka  nomsebenzi  bafuna  ukhuselo  oluthe   xaxa.   Kunzima
ukusebenza esikhathini samanje ngenxa yokwanda  kobugebengu  nokungahloniphi
impilo yomunye umuntu. Kuningi  engabe  ngiyakusho  isikhathi  asingivumeli.
Futhi  ngiyambona  nje  uSihlalo  laphaya  usezovele   angicishe.   Angivele
ngizicishe-ke khona ungakangicishi. Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Recently in Khayelitsha, here in Cape Town, a  security  guard  was  killed
and nurses are afraid of continuing with the work and they need  intensified
security. It is difficult to work nowadays because of the  crime  and  those
disrespectful of other people's lives. I have a lot  to  say,  but  time  is
against me, and I see that the Chairperson is about to switch my  microphone
off. Let me switch it off myself, before he does.] Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP  (Mr  J  M  Mahlangu):  Akusiye  uSihlalo
okuncishayo kodwa yilabo abakunikeze isikhathi sokuthi  ukhulume.  [Uhleko.]
[It is not the Chairperson who deprives you of  time,  but  the  people  who
allocated the time for your speech. [Laughter.]]

But, I heard Mrs Dipuo asking us to warn her beforehand. I agree  with  her.
When I press the button the first time, members should know that  they  have
one minute left. When I press for the second time, members should end  their
speeches as their time would have ended. [Laughter.]
Dr G M RAMOKGOPA (Gauteng): Chairperson, hon Minister and  Deputy  Minister,
colleagues and hon members of the NCOP, I stand here to support  the  policy
direction and priorities as outlined by the Minister of Health in  improving
the health of our people in South Africa. We must agree that,  as  we  enter
the second decade of freedom in our country, we  have  acted  decisively  to
improve the quality of life and health of our people.

We must also agree that we have made significant progress  that  could  only
have been made by people focused on making our country  a  better  place  to
live in. Equally, we must also agree that we still have some way  to  go  in
ensuring that we deal decisively with  the  consequences  of  300  years  of
fighting to destroy an ill system of colonialism and apartheid.

We remain guided by the knowledge  that  there  are  many  ordinary,  indeed
extraordinary people who paid dearly with their lives for us to  attain  our
freedom. Our  inspiration  comes  from  the  ideals  of  stalwarts  such  as
Victoria Mxenge and martyred doctors such as Ribeiros of Mamelodi, and  also
those ideals expressed by the young MK soldier Solomon  Mahlangu  who,  when
sentenced to death by the apartheid regime, declared that  "my  blood  shall
nourish the tree that will bear the fruits of liberation".

As we prepare to celebrate a decade  of  our  liberation,  the  fruits  that
Solomon Mahlangu spoke of are  evident  in  the  improved  accessibility  of
health services for all our children, women, people with  disabilities,  the
elderly and communities in general. There are areas that we  still  need  to
reach, but overall there has been an improvement.

Gauteng has been given an R8,1 billion budget which represents  30%  of  the
Gauteng provincial budget. This will certainly go a long  way  in  investing
and building a caring and quality  health  care  system  and  contribute  to
better health for our people. I have listened quite passionately  and  agree
fully that we need to move towards a situation of equity, but we  must  also
acknowledge that even in provinces such as Gauteng inequity remains.

Gauteng has the second largest population in the country, surpassed only  by
KwaZulu-Natal. The  discrepancies  are  quite  wide.  The  richest  live  in
Sandton, and the poorest live just a stone's throw away  in  Alexandra.  The
budget will be used to ensure that we achieve our vision  of  health  for  a
better life for all our people,  especially  those  who  are  vulnerable  to
diseases and injury. Through this budget,  we  will  be  able  to  build  on
achievements and will focus on three strategic goals.  These  are  promoting
health to prevent illnesses ... re gopole gore  thibela  malwetsi,  e  phala
kalafo ... [... we must remember that prevention is better than  cure.]  ...
providing quality, accessible and efficient services in  terms  of  clinics,
hospitals and ambulance services and ensuring value for money and  being  an
effective organisation by investing in our personnel and human resources  as
well as improving systems that will enable us to deliver better.

The budget aims to help the people of Gauteng to push back the frontiers  of
poverty by investing in its most important  resource,  our  people.  Working
together with our sister departments and communities, we  will  continue  to
advance the frontiers of health and prosperity. In this  financial  year  we
have been able to focus on equity within the  province.  In  this  financial
year we have allocated the budget in such a way that there is  an  equitable
distribution of resources  amongst  the  three  regions.  All  regions  have
received an above-inflation increase, but some have received more  than  per
capita expenditure that is more equitable and based  on  the  needs  of  the
communities.

The spin-off will be a positive incentive for patients  to  access  services
closer  to  where  they  live,  thereby  reducing  overcrowding   in   areas
previously better resourced. In this case,  the  Ekhuruleni-Sedibeng  region
will benefit with a higher increase for primary  health  care  services.  We
have also ensured that we protect the centres of excellence in our  province
which are also our national assets, and we  are  the  envy  of  the  private
sector and other First World countries.

To this extent, we have identified a number of these centres and we will  be
able to pool them at tertiary  institutions.  This  includes  health  public
schools, the neurophysiology unit at the  Pretoria  Academic  Hospital,  the
trauma oncology unit at Johannesburg, and the renal and hand units at  Chris
Hani Baragwanath Hospital. The list goes on. We will continue  to  build  on
these centres of excellence which are a national heritage.

In addition to the 5% direct increase allocated to tertiary services in  the
budget, additional resources for general and  specialist  services  will  be
funded at regional hospital level. Family medicine and public  health  posts
with universities will also be strengthened. I am  raising  this  because  a
concern has been raised by our universities that the decrease in  allocation
for tertiary services for Gauteng means that we, as the ANC-led  Government,
do  not  treasure  these  centres  of  excellence.  The  redistribution   of
resources to other provinces will enable those provinces to provide  quality
care even at the tertiary level.  I  have  met  with  the  deans  and  vice-
chancellors of these universities and  we  agreed  that  the  contracts  and
capacity will be built in other provinces. We will also build  other  levels
of services in our province as we restructure our health care system to  fit
the budget.

We have also prioritised  the  revitalisation  of  hospitals  in  previously
disadvantaged communities and  these  received  the  second  largest  budget
increase of approximately 9%. The biggest winner of  our  budget  is  indeed
primary health care clinics.

Since 1997, there has been a huge increase in terms  of  visits  to  primary
health care clinics. We had 4,1 million visits in 1997 and in 2002 this  had
increased to 10 million. Obviously, our people are voting with  their  feet.
We have been able to increase the number  of  nurses  and  doctors  and  the
availability of medicines at primary level.  We  are  seeing  a  shift  from
hospital outpatients to our own primary health care services.

With respect to the improvement of investing in our staff, we fully  support
the national strategy  of  recruiting  and  retaining  primary  health  care
nurses. In this case, we  have  strengthened  our  ability  to  have  nurses
equipped to support the survivors of violence. We were trailing behind,  but
we will train our forensic nurses within this financial year. We  have  also
provided more than R20 million annually  to  create  new  permanent  nursing
posts  across  all  sectors  of  public  health.  We  are  continuing   with
initiatives of aggressive recruitment and retention  strategies  for  nurses
as well as those with other scarce skills, such as pharmacists.

I want to conclude by saying that we have  been  able  to  work  with  other
service providers in particular in the private  sector  to  ensure  that  we
improve our initiative to reduce the burden of HIV/Aids. In  this  instance,
we have successfully reduced the syphilis  infection  rate  by  83%  through
this co-operation with the private sector. However,  we  also  call  on  our
colleagues in the private sector to assist us in improving the  immunisation
coverage for our children from 79% to  over  85%  in  this  financial  year.
Recent studies that we have undertaken show that whilst  the  public  sector
seems to be doing well, the private sector still trails far behind  in  this
respect.

I wish to share with the NCOP our progress around improving our capacity  to
attract resources into the public sector, especially now that Gauteng has  a
higher proportion of private health resources. We have introduced  units  in
a number of our hospitals starting with Johannesburg Hospital, Helen  Joseph
Hospital and  the  Pretoria  West  Hospital.  We  will  continue  with  this
approach. These facilities have been highlighted by a number of  people  who
have  used  them,  including  some  of  my  colleagues  in  the   provincial
government, as centres of excellence. I note that  some  members  here  have
used these centres. These private wards are there to attract those  who  are
privately insured. This will help  to  increase  the  purse  of  the  public
health service.

I must indicate that these are a benchmark. We are working towards  reducing
the gaps between the public and private sector and all our  facilities  will
be of that quality. This is a benchmark that we have set for  ourselves  and
we will achieve it.

We have been able to invest in the overall improvement of the health of  our
women. This year  we  will  strengthen  our  province-wide  cervical  cancer
screening programme so that women are  able  to  identify  cancers  such  as
cervical cancer early on and do something about it.

Finally, I would like to say that we have made progress.  We  have  invested
in our people's health, improved the human resource of our economy and  made
significant strides in pushing back the frontiers of poverty. I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms M A MOTSUMI-TSOPO (Free State): Hon Deputy Chairperson of the  NCOP,  hon
Minister, hon Deputy Minister, colleagues from the  provinces,  hon  members
of the NCOP, honourable guests, ladies and gentlemen, as we enter the  first
decade  of  our  hard-won  freedom,  the  clarion  call  by  the  President,
President Thabo Mbeki, made a while ago  for  the  acceleration  of  service
delivery, becomes louder. There is no  question  about  the  fact  that  the
fruits of this freedom must be enjoyed by  our  people  in  their  entirety,
irrespective of their creed, political orientation or the  colour  of  their
skin. There is further no doubt about the fact  that,  since  the  onset  of
this democracy and freedom, this ANC-led Government  has  worked  tirelessly
to ensure that our people do indeed enjoy the fruit of this freedom.

As we engage one another around the Budget Vote that the  hon  Minister  has
tabled in  this  House,  we  are  indeed  mindful,  as  the  ANC,  that  the
challenges are still mammoth. Despite all the gains  we  have  made  in  our
endeavours to create a better life for all and to roll  back  the  frontiers
of poverty, many challenges still exist  and  we  will  not  shy  away  from
stating and addressing them.

This is particularly so in the health sector, as in any other sector of  our
society. As the deployees of the giant people's movement, we of course  take
the lead from this movement to address these challenges  and  build  on  the
people's contract for a better life for all.

During its 51st national conference, our movement  took  resolutions  around
the following health matters, amongst others: strengthening  primary  health
care services, especially in  rural  areas;  improving  the  management  and
governance of hospitals and clinics; decisively attacking  communicable  and
preventable illnesses; accelerating appropriate decentralisation of  certain
health services to local  government;  strengthening  programmes  for  child
nutrition; food security and improvement and nourishment, and so on.

Allow me to share with this House our plans to implement  these  resolutions
this year and the progress we have made  during  the  past  years  on  these
issues.

One thing that is key in the delivery of  quality  health  services  to  the
constituencies is the issue of  personnel,  as  some  of  the  members  have
correctly put it  today.  One  of  the  resolutions  of  the  51st  national
conference of the movement states as follows: We need to ensure  that  norms
and standards including staffing and service delivery, that  are  applicable
across the country are implemented over the period of five years.

Undoubtedly, without proper personnel in our  facilities  we   will  not  be
able to advance quality health service delivery. It is for this reason  that
we have moved to ensure that we have proper minimum staffing levels  in  our
institutions. We have managed to develop the  new  staff  establishment  for
our hospitals, our community health  centres  and  clinics  around  Qwa-Qwa,
Thaba-Nchu and  Botshabelo,  which  are  currently  run  by  the  provincial
government,  and  we  are  in  the  process  of  reviewing  all  the   staff
establishments of local authorities, including those  of  emergency  medical
services.

We have also managed to cost all  our  staffing  levels  needs,  which  come
close to R135 million. We  nonetheless  have  available  an  amount  of  R37
million  and,  during  the  course  of  this  financial  year,  we  will  do
everything in our power to ensure that we have the  necessary  personnel  in
place and will thus not rest until  we  have  a  positive  outcome  of  this
process.

Secondly, one other thing that is of critical importance in the  battle  for
quality health service delivery, which is pinned on our primary health  care
services, is the accessibility of  our  people  to  our  health  facilities,
particularly the clinics. The 51st national conference  resolution  on  this
matter is very clear: Strengthen primary health care,  especially  in  rural
areas. It is our intention as the province to  train  100  community  health
workers in rural areas. Thirty-five mobile clinics  have  been  procured  to
address rural health challenges and will soon be allocated  to  our  various
districts in the province. We will further implement  the  provincial  rural
health strategy in this financial year.

The clinic building and upgrading programme is  also  one  of  the  critical
programmes through  which  quality  primary  health  care  services  can  be
realised, both in rural and urban areas. We  have  embarked  fully  on  this
programme. For example, since the implementation  of  the  clinic  upgrading
and building programme, in 1994-95, 79 projects were handled and  completed.
During the 2002-03 financial year alone, we handled 25 clinic  building  and
upgrading projects to the tune of R28,4 million  which  are  now  completed.
Twelve of these  projects  are  new  clinics,  13  are  upgradings.  We  are
currently busy with 20 projects, of which  9  are  new  clinics,  one  is  a
community health centre and 11 are upgradings, amounting to a total  of  R35
million.

Surely we cannot just simply spend money on personnel and infrastructure  to
heal our people when they are ill without us looking into measures that  can
be employed to ensure that they do not fall ill  in  the  first  place.  The
role of health promotion is critical in this regard. As the Free  State,  we
held our first conference on health promotion from 7  to  9  May  2003.  The
conference was funded by the World Health Organisation. This conference  has
given further impetus to our health promotion activities, as we now  have  a
clear costed health promotion plan also funded by the WHO. As we  embark  on
these health promotion initiatives, one of the diseases that  should  be  at
the centre of health promotion campaigns is the scourge of HIV/Aids.

The 51st national conference has taken  a  number  of  resolutions  on  this
matter, one of which is the need to mitigate the impact  of  HIV/Aids.  This
disease remains a  challenge  that  has  to  be  addressed  alongside  other
debilitating diseases, because in the province we are not going  to  elevate
HIV/Aids alone and leave  other  debilitating  diseases  aside.  Our  battle
against this disease has been advanced by the launch of the PMTCT sites  and
many other programmes that  we  have  embarked  upon.  The  PMTCT  expansion
programme, immediately following the  court  order,  constituted  the  first
phase of the expansion of sites in this  province.  The  Free  State  health
department is currently  running  a  comprehensive  prevention-of-mother-to-
child-transmission programme in eight hospitals and 60 clinics. We  are  not
going to rush, because we must make sure that as we deliver the  service  it
is going to be of acceptable standard.

One programme that continues to present us with enormous challenges in  some
of the areas of our province is the emergency medical services. As  part  of
the process of addressing this, we are in  the  process  of  establishing  a
control room which we anticipate will be operational before the end  of  the
2003-04 financial year. This control room is very unique.  It  will,  beyond
any doubt, improve the response time of our ambulances. We  have  placed  an
order  for  an  extra  32  ambulances  to  replace  some  of  our   worn-out
ambulances, as well as six  commuter  transport  vehicles,  amounting  to  a
total amount of  R9,5  million.  These  endeavours  are  in  line  with  the
resolution of the 51st national conference to ensure access to  health  care
on a 24-hour basis. I must further mention that we  are  reviewing  all  24-
hour clinics and have designated all clinics as either 8-hour, 12-hour,  24-
four-hour or on-call service clinics.

In order to address the challenge of the revitalisation  of  our  hospitals,
we have deemed it fit  to  enter  into  a  public-private  partnership  with
community health management, particularly for  the  revitalisation  projects
taking place at Pelonomi  and  Universitas  Hospitals.  This  is  the  first
collocation or public-private partnership concession agreement that we  have
entered into in terms of the Public Finance Management  Act.  The  agreement
with  community  hospital  management  involves  Universitas  and   Pelonomi
Hospitals. The department will generate an income of R206 million.

In conclusion, I want to congratulate the hon Minister Dr Manto  Tshabalala-
Msimang from the bottom of my heart, and thank her for  the  leadership  she
is giving to the health sector. You mustn't become impatient and tired.  You
must continue in the manner in which you are doing things.

We must also make sure that the doubting Thomases of this world do not  view
this kind of advancement in  the  lives  of  our  people  as  insignificant.
Despite all their denunciation and accusations, we continue to work hard  in
responding to the call of the President  for  the  acceleration  of  service
delivery. Like the President, we  are  all  moved  by  the  squalor  of  our
people, which they have been facing  since  the  previous  dispensation.  We
will never rest until the tide has completely turned around.  One  thing  is
for sure, the tide has turned. [Applause].

Dr P J C NEL: Dankie Voorsitter. Voor ek begin, wil ek graag die agb Adjunk-
minister  wat  ook  vandag  in  die  Huis  is,  sterkte   toewens   met   sy
nooienstoespraak in hierdie Huis vandag. Nie dat  hy  dit  rêrig  nodig  het
nie.

Ek volg graag op die agb LUR van die Vrystaat. Soos  u  kan  hoor,  is  daar
geen twyfel dat die agb  LUR  in  die  Departement  van  Gesondheid  in  die
Vrystaat onder haar leiding poog om 'n kwaliteit gesondheidsdiens  te  lewer
ten spyte van 'n beperkte begroting. Ek sê 'n beperkte begroting,  want  Die
"equitable share" wat vanjaar aan gesondheid toegeken is  in  die  Vrystaat,
het maar net met 10,4% gestyg en as die gesondheidsinflasiekoers  wat  altyd
omtrent 3% hoër is as die gewone inflasie in berekening  gebring  word,  dan
was daar in reële terme eintlik 'n vermindering in  die  toegekende  bedrag.
Dit plaas 'n geweldige las op die lewering  van  gesondheidsdienste  in  die
Vrystaat.

Ek wil aan die hand doen dat by die toekenning van  "equitable  shares"  aan
die provinsies eerder die gesondheidinflasie as  die  gewone  inflasiesyfers
in aanmerking geneem moet word.  Miskien  kan  Statistiek  SA  ook  poog  om
gesondheidsinflasiesyfers gereeld te publiseer in die toekoms.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Thank you, Chairperson. Before I begin, I would like to  wish
the hon the Deputy Minister, who is also in the House today,  all  the  best
with his maiden speech in this House today. Not that he really needs it.

I take pleasure in speaking after the hon MEC from the Free  State.  As  you
can hear, there is no doubt that the hon MEC in the department of health  in
the Free State, in her leadership, endeavours to  render  a  quality  health
service in spite of a limited budget. I say a limited  budget,  because  the
equitable share that has been allocated to health in  the  Free  State  this
year has only risen by 10,4% and if the  health  inflation  rate,  which  is
always about 3% higher  than  the  normal  inflation  rate,  is  taken  into
account, then there was actually a reduction in real  terms  in  the  amount
allocated. This places  an  enormous  burden  on  the  rendering  of  health
services in the Free State.

I want to suggest that when equitable shares are allocated to the  provinces
the health inflation rather than  the  usual  inflation  figures  should  be
taken into account. Perhaps Statistics SA can also  try  to  publish  health
inflation figures regularly in future.]

I would like to thank the hon Minister for making  available  an  amount  of
R500 million for the first time  to  try  and  attract  and  retain  skilled
professionals  by  improving  the  working  conditions,  accommodation   and
salaries of health  workers  in  the  rural  areas.  To  retain  the  highly
professional medical staff in our training  hospitals,  the  provinces  need
more funds to maintain and replace highly sophisticated  equipment  that  is
vital for training purposes and for  the  highly  skilled  professionals  to
perform the work that  they  are  trained  for.  Hon  Minister,  is  it  not
possible that a conditional grant for the maintenance of  equipment  can  be
allocated to the provinces? Ek vra maar net. [I am only asking.]

It is of the  utmost  importance  also  that  the  mentioned  incentives  be
implemented as soon as possible. The fact that according to  the  Democratic
Nurses' Association of South  Africa  approximately  300  nurses  are  still
leaving our country monthly is appalling, as is  the  statement  in  the  SA
Health Review 2002 that 43% of the  medical  students  have  indicated  that
they are going  to  leave  the  country  after  completing  their  community
service here.

That brings me to the HIV/Aids issue  -  the  most  serious  threat  to  our
people that this country has ever experienced. I have no doubt  in  my  mind
that the Department of Health has a comprehensive  approach  to  this  major
challenge. However, the critical element  that  is  still  missing  at  this
stage is a guideline for using antiretroviral drugs as part of the  national
treatment strategy.

We have learned from the hon Minister today that the  report  of  the  Joint
Health and Treasury Task Team into the cost of  various  treatment  options,
including the use  of  antiretroviral  drugs,  would  be  presented  to  the
Cabinet pretty soon in order to take a decision on this issue. I  hope  that
this will be next week or sooner.
Although the hon Minister has stated that the latest HIV  prevalence  survey
at antenatal clinics confirmed that the rate of infection has stabilised,  I
can assure the hon Minister that this is not the case in the Free State.  In
this respect, I would like to quote from a speech delivered by the  hon  MEC
of the Free State on 6 April in Bloemfontein:


  Despite the progress we have made regarding our programme on HIV/Aids,  I
  am nonetheless still troubled by the levels of HIV/Aids in the  province.
  I want to give you a picture of this instance with statistics as  regards
  regional hospitals in the province.


  At the Bongani Hospital (Welkom  Regional  Hospital)  in  2002,  a  total
  number of 3 045 children were tested for HIV and,  out  of  this,  2  101
  (69%) tested positive. In 2003, a  total  number  of  709  children  were
  tested and 663 (93,5%) children admitted to the hospital tested positive.
  Between February and April of this year, a total  number  of  529  adults
  were tested for HIV/Aids and 349 (66%) of these adults  tested  positive.
  This is a clear indication of the mammoth challenge we are facing.

I am aware of the fact that one of the  arguments  is  that  antiretrovirals
are not a cure for  this  disease,  but  neither  are  the  drugs  used  for
hypertension,  some  malignancies,  Parkinson's  disease,  and  many   other
diseases, but at least these drugs improve the quality of life  and  prolong
the life expectancy of these patients.

There are  millions  of  patients  infected  with  HIV  who  need  treatment
urgently. South Africa has a moral  duty  to  assist  these  people.  Nobody
knocking on the door of the health sector for help can be sent  away  empty-
handed. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr Z L MKHIZE (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you very  much.  Chairperson,  the  hon
Minister, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, Deputy Minister, Renier Schoeman,  my
colleagues  and  MECs  and  members  of  this  House,  firstly  I  want   to
congratulate the Minister on her speech and I also want  to  thank  her  for
the leadership in the health sector. I must say that it's a  very  demanding
portfolio from a distance where we stand, but we  also  are  impressed  with
your commitment and dedication. Equally, the staff in the  department,  from
what we have seen, are also quite  dedicated,  hardworking,  supportive  and
committed. And therefore my comments, as we start, are  based  on  the  fact
that that is the kind of team that is working on the issues of health.

I want to say therefore that I was pleased to hear the Minister focusing  on
the issue of the budget, saying to the  members  that  she  would  like  the
members to focus on the overall pressure on this  department  vis-á-vis  the
allocation of the funds. In particular, I want to say  that,  with  all  the
dedication that we have, there is a lot of pressure on this department.  One
form of pressure comes from the problem of HIV/Aids. Another bit comes  from
the exodus of staff, and the other part comes from inadequate resources.

My colleagues here and myself are going to  be  indicating,  and  some  have
already done so, what has been achieved with the amount of  money  which  we
are grateful to have received. I want to submit that the  hon  members  here
in this House and the National Assembly  need  to  focus  on  reviewing  and
improving or increasing the budget to the health sector. In  particular,  we
have noticed that with the increase that we have received, we still  have  a
challenge to deal with the queues  in  our  precious  department.  They  are
becoming quite long and unmanageable. In fact, we still have  a  problem  of
staff members that are overworked  and  the  shortages  of  staff.  In  some
cases, we have had to reduce  or  freeze  the  posts  in  keeping  with  the
budget. And sometimes when we look, at the end of  the  year,  at  a  budget
that is well-balanced, then I say to my  colleagues  in  the  Treasury  that
they must always remember that good bookkeeping does not equal  good  health
care. And, in this case, we would only appeal to the members of  this  House
to use their influence to assist us to deal with  the  situation  where  the
health budget has to deal with an increase in patients who are sicker,  with
fewer staff  and,  therefore,  patients  come  in  more  repeatedly,  mainly
because of the pressure of HIV/Aids.

I have also noted that in  our  case,  for  example,  R2,9  billion  is  the
backlog on the revitalisation of our facilities. At the  rate  that  we  are
getting the conditional grants, it will take us 25  to  30  years  to  cover
that. Therefore, I'm sure that this is the challenge that my colleagues  are
also facing in the different provinces. Therefore, we  need  to  be  careful
with the increase - we need a little bit more of an increase  -  because  we
want to avoid a situation where we have to  continue  cutting  down  on  the
staff complement until the services collapse.
On the issue of HIV/Aids which, as I said, is a  major  challenge,  I  think
this is one which is responsible for  the  increasing  numbers  of  patients
that are coming in.  We  have,  in  our  province,  mobilised  the  churches
together with Government and NGOs to do just about  all  that  needs  to  be
done  in  relation  to  the  prevention,  counselling  and  mobilisation  of
communities and families on the issue of care of HIV/Aids.

We also moved onto intensifying the treatment of  opportunistic  infections.
As an example, just under a million Diflucan tablets have  been  distributed
to deal with cryptococcal meningitis. This is over 60% of  the  distribution
for the country. In this case we are  very  grateful  to  the  Minister  for
clinching  this  deal,  because  it's  been  very   helpful.   Post-exposure
prophylaxis for staff who are involved in accidental injuries  is  available
in all the hospitals and for rape survivors also. It  is  available  at  all
major hospitals and community health centres.  The  prevention-of-mother-to-
child-transmission programme is also available at all the hospitals  and  is
now being rolled out to the clinics.

In  so  far  as  we  are  concerned  with  dealing  with   the   issues   of
antiretrovirals  and  any  other  problem  in  relation  to  our   five-year
strategic plan, we have embarked on almost all  the  issues  and  now  we're
preparing, as the whole discussion is now, for the issue  of  antiretroviral
treatment. The issue here is that we need to  have  very  careful  and  good
planning in our antiretroviral programme, because we don't want a  programme
that will come in and then collapse. And therefore  we  welcome  the  review
that has been done by the Treasury  and  health  committee  on  this  issue,
because it will help us embark on a programme properly.

Having said so, we are also focusing on the priority for this  year,  namely
tuberculosis, and our main concern is  the  rising  rate  of  multiple  drug
resistance to TB.  We  have  set  for  ourselves,  for  2005,  the  goal  of
increasing the cure rate from 29% to 85%, and the detection  rate  from  30%
to 70%, and we want to halve the instance of TB by 2010.

We also have a target which was set by the President  to  eliminate  malaria
and here we are saying that we are on course to deal with that  issue.  Here
again, we rely on the support from the Minister, because she's been  working
on a huge programme in the SADC countries to deal with the problems  of  TB.
We hope that our colleagues in Mozambique will start using Dots and we  will
also have to put up clinics on the border with Mozambique to  actually  deal
with and treat patients there as they walk into the country, because 28%  of
our  patients  with  malaria  actually  have  come  from  the   neighbouring
countries.

Having said so, we also just want to say that we  are  concerned  about  the
fact  that  the  school  nutrition  programme  is  going  to  be  under  the
Department of Education. If we were sadists we would also be  saying  ``good
riddance'', but it is actually quite a  complicated  programme  and  we  are
worried about the fact that  the  conditional  grant  is  not  going  to  be
merging with the targeting strategy that has been set by  national.  If  you
are going the route of farm schools, rural schools,  informal  and  township
schools, we in our  province  estimate  that  we  need  an  additional  R500
million to cover that, and we believe this House needs to be aware of  those
particular issues.

I also want to echo the sentiments in the President's speech when he  opened
Parliament and said, "The tide has turned." We have the pleasure  of  having
noticed a 76% reduction in the malaria rate in KwaZulu-Natal and here  again
we are grateful for the contribution of the national Minister in  this  case
and, of course, we also congratulate her on receiving the SADC award on  the
best malaria control programme for South Africa.

We have also seen the reduction of cholera to about a  0,5%  mortality  rate
and here the issue is related to problems of  poverty,  water,  health,  and
education shortages. In this case, interestingly, we have  reduced  cholera,
but in the area where it started, we have just seen an upsurge of  a  simple
problem of scabies. This says that Health alone is not the  answer  to  good
health, but that we need an overall comprehensive development strategy.

We have also recorded 5 116  cataract  surgical  operations  where  we  have
people who were blind as a result of cataracts and have now  regained  their
sight.

Minister, as mentioned, we have the commissioning and opening of the  state-
of-the-art Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. I must invite members  to
come and view it, so that you are able to see the balance  between  some  of
the concerns that we have with regard to the  Third  World  kind  of  health
services, and the extent to which we can advance technology so that  we  are
able  to  accommodate  the  best  equipment  available  in  the   world   as
represented by what we can offer as well in this country.

We are increasing the number of ambulances from 218 in the  next  two  years
to 306, and the 24-hour clinics from 41 to 63. We are  also  increasing  the
number of community health centres by two every year, and we  are  going  to
be building an additional 20 new clinics every year.  We  will  be  doubling
the nursing intake and increasing the number of  community  health  workers.
At this moment we stand at 5 000. We have  allocated  funds  for  additional
equipment and our hospitals have also won good governance awards.

So, we are saying with this budget, with all the limitations  that  it  has,
that we  are  committed  to  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  and
providing a better life for all. I thank you, Mr Chairperson. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.   Hon   Deputy
Chairperson, hon Minister, hon provincial Ministers and hon members  of  the
NCOP, it is a pleasure to follow my colleague, the hon Zweli Mkhize,  who  I
have a lot of contact with on nonmedical matters  in  our  respective  party
connections in KwaZulu-Natal.

When I was appointed as Deputy Minister of Health on 4 November  last  year,
I said I saw my appointment not only as a challenge, but  also  as  a  great
opportunity to serve my  country.  I  must  say  that  this  view  has  been
reinforced by all my experiences since my appointment. I have  also  made  a
point of repeating, as often as I can, that I believe there  is  a  new  and
positive political dynamic of putting South Africa's interests first,  which
is gaining momentum in our country. I hold this view, because I think  there
is an increasing acceptance that the problems of  South  Africa  are  shared
problems, which call for  a  shared  commitment  to  resolve  them.  I  will
continue to play as positive  a  role  as  I  can  in  this  regard  in  the
knowledge that, I believe, by serving the common good, the interests of  all
are best served.

I also wish to record in this House my appreciation for the warm  welcome  I
have been afforded in the National Ministry and the  Department  of  Health,
also from the provincial health Ministers and their  departments,  from  the
chairpersons and members of the portfolio committees dealing with health  in
the National Assembly as well as  the  NCOP  and  from  the  health  private
sector. I must also share with this House that,  as  a  functionary  in  the
national Ministry, I have been impressed by the  excellent  and  valued  co-
operation in Minmec, which is  chaired  and  led  by  the  hon  Minister  of
Health.

I believe it is a good example of  excellent  teamwork  and  the  collective
effort in the spirit of common purpose. And I think  their  strong  presence
in this House here today again proves and underlines what I am saying.

So ek wil sê dit is 'n  voorreg  om  deel  te  wees  van  hierdie  groot  en
toegewyde span wat oor die lengte en die breedte van  ons  land  strewe  vir
gesondheid en gehalte in mediese sorg. [I therefore want to say that  it  is
a privilege to be part of this large and dedicated team  which  strives  for
health and quality in medical care across the  length  and  breadth  of  our
country.]

In supporting the Budget Vote of Health in this Chamber today, I would  like
to recognise the special and valuable role played by members  of  the  NCOP,
especially  in  portfolios  where  the   Constitution   assigns   concurrent
functions to national and provincial spheres  of  government.  The  role  of
this Council in terms of the processing of legislation is  well  understood.
I sometimes think that its value in  terms  of  assuring  accountability  is
perhaps underestimated and not given adequate recognition.

In portfolios like Health, where the greater part of the national budget  is
spent by provinces, the Select Committee on Social Services, under the  able
leadership of the hon  Loretta  Jacobus,  promotes  significant  interaction
with provinces, which assists in not only monitoring expenditure,  but  also
in understanding the  particular  successes  and  challenges  of  individual
provinces. I would like to acknowledge them specifically today.

The combination of provincial visits by members of the NCOP, reports to  the
NCOP, NCOP hearings and active participation of Health MECs in the  debates,
like we have seen today, contributes in a very  unique  way  to  the  vital,
interactive role that the NCOP  plays  in  health  administration  in  South
Africa.

Ek wil net in hierdie stadium my voorbereide  toespraak  onderbreek  en  net
verwys na berigte wat na my gestuur is deur 'n bejaarde persoon wat  sê  dat
hy baie  bekommerd  is  oor  gevalle  en  insidente  en  hy  het  'n  aantal
mediaberigte  aangeheg,  meeste  van  hulle  uit  die  koerant,  Beeld,   in
Johannesburg, wat gaan oor gevalle van slegte  gebeurtenisse  in  hospitale.
En ek gee onmiddellik toe dat wonderlike werk gedoen word in 'n  baie  groot
persentasie van provinsiale hospitale. Maar al wat dit  weer  vir  my  gewys
het, en hy het geskryf, nie in 'n negatiewe gees nie, maar in 'n  bekommerde
gees; en dit het dit net weer vir my gesteun hoe dit  ongelukkig  werk  dat,
wanneer daar iets sleg gebeur, dit onmiddellik na vore kom  en  baie  aandag
kry, en baie goeie werk wat gedoen word nie na vore kom nie.  Maar  dit  wys
net ook weer wat die uitdaging is en in  watter  mate  daar  'n  kollektiewe
poging moet wees, op provinsiale, nasionale, en op elke vlak, om te  kyk  om
ook hierdie soort van gebeurtenisse en voorvalle tot 'n absolute minimum  te
beperk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[I just want to interrupt my prepared speech at  this  stage  and  refer  to
reports which were sent to me by an elderly person who says that he is  very
worried about cases and  incidents,  and  he  attached  a  number  of  media
reports, most of them from  the  newspaper  Beeld,  in  Johannesburg,  which
concern cases of unfortunate events in hospitals. And I immediately  concede
that wonderful work is being done in a very large percentage  of  provincial
hospitals. And he wrote about it not in a negative spirit, but in a  worried
spirit; and this has just emphasised to me once again how unfortunate it  is
that when something bad happens it immediately comes to light  and  receives
a lot of attention, and very good work that is done does not come to  light.
But that simply shows again what the challenge is and to what  extent  there
should be a collective effort, provincial, national, and on every level,  to
see to it that events and  incidents  such  as  these  are  reduced  to  the
absolute minimum.]

A critical factor in the quality of provincial health services is access  to
support services, such as laboratories, blood supplies, and so on.  Both  of
these services have been restructured  in  recent  years  to  form  national
entities that strive to serve all South Africans on an equal footing.

The National Health Laboratory Service  was  born  as  a  public  entity  in
October 2001, and is  the  sole  provider  of  laboratory  services  to  the
provincial health departments. It has almost  300  laboratories  around  the
country and its budget is close to R970 million, most of which is funded  by
fees  for  services  provided.  The  fact  of  the  matter   is   that   the
laboratories, large or small, are going to determine  the  success  of  this
NHLS. Its laboratories in all parts of the country that  support  clinicians
and thousands of public hospitals and clinics on a daily basis are going  to
be the test.

I believe it has got an  important  role  to  play  in  the  rebuilding  and
building of this country's health  infrastructure,  also  in  provinces  and
also in the very needy area of rural hospitals.

I am also pleased to be able to tell you that, in  recent  times,  the  NHLS
has had an improved, more stable period after a difficult period  that  also
culminated in the resignation of its  first  chief  executive  officer,  but
there has been a caretaker CEO in place since  October  last  year,  in  the
person of Dr Crisp. I want to thank him for his guidance and say  thank  you
for the guidance of the chairperson, Ms Sesi Baloyi. It has  stabilised  and
its services are improving steadily, and I think it is appropriate to  thank
them for the effort they have invested to get that service back  on  a  firm
footing. There is a new appointment of a CEO and  I  am  confident  that  he
will have the necessary insight and experience to continue to take the  NHLS
forward, paying close attention to the needs of provinces where the  service
is least developed, and the needs are the greatest.

Reference was made by one  of  the  hon  members  here  also  today  to  the
question of  medico-legal  laboratories  and  this  is  another  area  where
restructuring has been long awaited. I would say that this year we  hope  to
see further movement in terms of the transfer of these mortuaries  from  the
Police Service to the provincial health departments where they  belong,  for
very good and logical reasons.

Treasury has allocated funding  for  the  capital  works  that  need  to  be
carried out at mortuaries to create  facilities  conducive  to  high-quality
work. We are also discussing with Treasury the flexible utilisation of  such
finance over two or three financial years.

All provinces are giving their full co-operation  and  four  provinces  have
already indicated that they will be in a position to begin the  transfer  of
medico-legal mortuaries within  12  months  of  receiving  funding  for  the
renovations  that  are  contemplated.  From  the  side   of   the   national
department, we will continue to deal with and approach this  matter  with  a
sense of urgency.

Another area where  collaboration  with  the  criminal  justice  system  has
become  critical  and  increasingly  successful   is   that   of   combating
pharmaceutical fraud. I am informed that a number of provinces have  in  the
past year made significant breakthroughs in  unmasking  criminal  syndicates
at work, selling  state  drugs  to  the  private  sector.  But,  of  course,
criminals  are  notorious  for  their  inventiveness  and  the  Internet  is
increasingly becoming a vehicle for illicit  trafficking  of  pharmaceutical
products. The illegality of it  lies  in  the  cross-border  nature  of  the
operation and the fraudulent issuing of prescriptions  to  support  Internet
mail orders, and the fact that the  drugs  are  often  unregistered  and  of
dubious quality.

Fortunately also this is investigated by the police and,  just  last  month,
one such operation was uncovered in Cape Town, where the so-called  pharmacy
to which foreign clients were sending their orders was nothing more  than  a
suburban home. The prescriptions needed to dispense the Schedule 5 drugs  on
offer were issued by Cape Town doctors who have never seen  their  so-called
patients. Clearly, the public needs to be made aware of how  dangerous  such
operations are and that so-called virtual pharmacies are no  substitute  for
the real thing.

In my participation in the Health Vote in the National Assembly a few  weeks
ago, I made the point that the view sometimes  expressed  from  outside  the
system that the major challenges of HIV/Aids and TB are not taken  seriously
enough from  the  side  of  Government  does  simply  not  accord  with  the
commitment I have seen within the public health sector to strengthening  our
ability to face up to the twin scourges of HIV/Aids and TB.

I believe that at this very moment serious consideration is being  given  by
the Government, inter alia, to a number of aspects, but also to  the  matter
of the extent of antiretroviral treatment, which underlines the  seriousness
with which the challenge of HIV/Aids is being approached.  The  position  of
the New NP, in respect of this, is on record  and  Dr  Nel  has  also  again
referred to it today, and it is not necessary  that  I  then  repeat  it  at
length, although it is taken care of in my prepared speech.

What I want to say is that, apart from this issue  -  and  I  say  it  again
today - there is clearly a  sense  of  purpose  that  lies  behind  a  clear
programme of action that is unfolding in accordance  with  the  department's
five-year national strategy, and any claim that there is currently  no  plan
for HIV/Aids is simply not true - it is very far from the truth.

Among the more interesting developments of the past two years is  the  birth
of various partnerships between the public health care  sector  and  private
enterprise. They  range  from  enterprises  where  the  shares  are  divided
between Government and the  private  sector,  to  differentiated  facilities
within public hospitals, to Government funding  of  nonprofit  organisations
and private sector sponsorship of public health campaigns.

A new entity for vaccine production has been brought  into  existence  as  a
result of a partnership between the Department  of  Health  and  the  Biovac
Consortium. The  purpose  of  this  is  to  revive  South  Africa's  vaccine
production capability through an infusion of private  investment.  Hospitals
in a range of  provinces  have  accommodated  private  patients  or  private
sector  initiatives  within  their  provinces.   And   amongst   them,   the
Johannesburg Hospital experienced immediate success with  the  provision  of
amenities for private patients to the extent that  I  believe  they  had  to
extend their capacity within just a few months of the  launch.  Also,  there
is the question of  Universitas  and  Pelonomi  Hospitals  in  Bloemfontein,
which the hon MEC Tsopo actually referred to as well.

In KwaZulu-Natal,  the  flagship  PPP  is  the  new  Inkosi  Albert  Luthuli
Hospital, where a range of nonclinical functions are being  outsourced.  The
underlying objective is to  achieve  better  service  in  fields  where  the
public sector has not been particularly effective.

When it comes to partnerships with nonprofit organisations,  the  department
has recognised the potential of loveLife  to  add  value  to  public  health
programmes. The department has entered into  a  three-way  partnership  with
loveLife and the Kaiser Family Foundation to  enhance  health  services  for
young people. At the heart of this programme  is  the  process  of  creating
youth-friendly services within primary health care clinics. The aim  by  the
end of 2003 is to have a 150 youth-friendly  clinics  up  and  running  and,
thereafter, the pace of roll-outs should increase to reach 3 000 clinics  in
three to five years.

The recent multicountry Racing against Malaria  initiative  could  not  have
been achieved without the generous support of  a  whole  set  or  number  of
private sector companies. The 4x4 vehicles for the rally  as  well  as  many
other costs were covered by donation. As in  all  the  above  examples,  the
real beneficiaries have been the  millions  of  people  who  depend  on  the
public health sector.

In conclusion, since taking up my position as Deputy Minister, I  have  come
to appreciate the special and useful co-operation that  exists  between  the
health Ministers of the SADC countries. I have  also  become  aware  of  the
extent to which Minister Tshabalala-Msimang  plays  a  significant  role  in
promoting and nurturing this co-operation.  For  example,  her  presence  at
every major event along the route of the recent malaria  rally  demonstrates
the kind of  time,  energy  and  commitment  she  devotes  to  regional  co-
operation to the benefit of the entire region.

Finally, I propose that  the  Budget  Vote  for  Health  be  supported.  The
programmes that are funded are appropriate. They are central,  both  to  the
continuing improvement  of  the  health  sector  and  to  providing  ongoing
support to provincial health departments in their  delivery  of  service  to
the people of this country.

Ek steun graag hierdie begrotingspos en doen dit met vrymoedigheid. [I  take
pleasure in supporting this Budget Vote and I do so with confidence.]

Mnu M  A  MZIZI  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Sihlalo,  Sekela  likaSihlalo,  ngivumele
ngifake izwi lokuhoxisa likaDkt  O  S  Baloyi  okunguyena  obezokwethula  le
nkulumo namhlanje la kule Ndlu.  Ngenxa  yezizathu  ezingaphezulu  kwamandla
akhe,  akaphumelelanga  wase  enginxusa-ke  ukuthi  angiyethule  le  nkulumo
yakhe. Cha, Ngqongqoshe! Umbono wenkulumo elapha  ukuthi  ukuba  bekungeyami
bengizofaka isicelo ngisibhekise emadodeni asathenga iViagra. Cha,  ayiqedwe
laphaya emakhemisi  ukuze  kutholakale  iNevirapine  neminye  imithi  yalolo
hlobo ukuze sikwazi ukulwa nalesi sifo esingunkuzi  kayihlehli.  [  Uhleko.]
(Translation of iZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr M A MZIZI (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, allow me  to
pass on Dr O S Baloyi's apologies for  his  absence.  He  was  scheduled  to
deliver this speech today in this House. For reasons beyond his  control  he
could no make it and therefore he asked me to  deliver  the  speech  on  his
behalf.

Minister, if this had been my own speech,  I  would  have  come  up  with  a
request directed to those men who still  buy  Viagra.  The  chemists  should
discontinue its supply so that nevirapine and medicines similar to that  can
be acquired in order to fight this devastating disease. [Laughter.]]

We all know that the  greatest  challenges  facing  the  Government  of  our
country are those faced by the  social  services  cluster  departments.  The
Health Department is one of the departments in that cluster.

In this debate, I will touch on the subject of health professionals. I  will
also touch a bit on the per capita health expenditure  and  spend  a  little
more time on the primary health  care  services.  This  is  the  area  I  am
familiar with and,  in  certain  cases  where  relevant,  I  shall  use  the
province of KwaZulu-Natal to illustrate points that I raise in my debate.

Let us take  a  look  at  the  situation  of  health  professionals  in  the
province's health department. There continues to be a decline in the  number
of professional nurses: 207 fewer in  February  2003  compared  to  December
2001; a  decline  of  medical  specialists  and  registrars:  236  fewer  in
February 2003 compared to December 2001. There is  also  a  decline  in  the
number of dental practitioners and psychologists.

Initiatives  to  improve  distribution  and  retention   of   personnel   by
increasing an existing rural allowance and broadening its scope to  a  wider
range of health professionals are highly appreciated. The increase  of  R500
million to R1 billion is a case in  point.  The  concern  remains,  however,
that the inequities still exist  in  personnel  distribution  between  urban
areas and rural areas.

With respect to  capital  expenditure,  we  note  that  the  department  has
budgeted  for  a  major  upgrading,  replacement   and   transformation   of
hospitals. Of special  note  are  the  attempts  to  step  up  the  hospital
revitalisation grant in the 2003 budget where  18  hospitals  are  going  to
benefit in this financial year.

Having said all that, I would like to  turn  to  more  mundane  issues  that
remain problems  facing  provincial  departments  of  health.  I  will  cite
examples as I see them in my province, KwaZulu-Natal.

According to the report provided to us by the  department  in  my  province,
they have 391 clinics including local authority  clinics,  which  provide  1
135 consulting rooms. All of these  clinics  provide  primary  health  care.
Currently 41 clinics are providing a 24-hour service, and it is  hoped  that
this year the number will increase by an additional  22  clinics  -  two  in
each district. This is highly appreciated. Of these clinics, it is a  matter
of concern that 13% are  in  a  poor  condition.  Client  transport  to  the
clinics remains problematic with 28% having access roads to clinics.  It  is
very poor. [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF the NCOP (Mr J M Mahlangu): Order,  hon  Mzizi.  I
do not want to comment on your opening  remarks.  However,  I  see  the  hon
Windvoël  is  very  unhappy  with  that  statement.  [Laughter.]  Maybe  the
Minister will comment about that; I'm not sure. [Laughter.]

Nkst M P THEMBA: Mgcinisihlalo, Make iNdvuna, tiNdvuna  tetifundza,  malunga
eMkhandlu  waVelonkhe  wemaProvinsi,  ngetfuke  kakhulu   bengingati   kutsi
KwaZulu-Natal basebentisa le-viagra. Yona ikhona kona  kodvwa  abalinciphise
leliphilisi bangalisebentisi  lonkhe.  [Luhleko.]  (Translation  of  Siswati
paragraph follows.)

[Mrs M P THEMBA: Chairperson, madam Minister, Ministers  in  the  provinces,
members of the NCOP, I was very shocked; I did not  know  that  in  KwaZulu-
Natal they are using Viagra. Yes, it is there,  but  has  to  be  minimised.
They should not use the drug as it is. [Laughter.]

The Select  Committee  on  Social  Services  last  month  invited  all  nine
provinces  to   participate   in   the   Intergovernmental   Fiscal   Review
interrogation  process  with  the  specific  purpose   of   examining   what
provincial priorities are with regard to their health budgets.

All provinces were also asked to outline some of the challenges facing  them
in meeting the health needs of their communities. Almost without  exception,
all provinces highlighted the fact that  their  budgets  do  not  adequately
cover their human resource needs. Some provinces, due  to  both  the  public
service moratorium and shortfalls in their budgets, found themselves  unable
to fill critical posts, leaving service delivery in a shocking state.

It became abundantly clear during our deliberation in the  select  committee
that we need  to  re-examine  the  system  of  allocation  to  some  of  our
provinces, especially the poorer provinces, when  the  time  comes  for  the
adjustments  estimate.  Although  the  budget   information   has   improved
remarkably in scope, reliability and availability largely as a result  of  a
system  overhaul  in  Treasury,  including  the  introduction  of  an   MTEF
programme, the passing of the PFMA and a presentation of audited  statements
on  spending  by  government  departments,  legislatures  and  other  public
entities, we still need to balance the real  needs  of  each  province  with
reliable programmatic costing analysis.

Macondzana  neNgculaza,  HIV/Aids,  leliTiko  leTemphilo   kanye   naletinye
tinhlangano litibophelele ekucedzeni lolubhubhane lwengculaza.  Kungako  nje
kulesabiwotimali  kukhushulwe  kakhulu   sabelo   lesimacondzana   nalesifo.
(Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[With regard to HIV/Aids, the Department of Health and  other  organisations
have taken responsibility for eliminating the pandemic scourge of  HIV/Aids.
That is the reason behind the increased allocation for this in the  budget.]


We believe that the allocations to provinces are not going to be  a  problem
but a challenge for provinces to  rise  to  the  occasion  and  spend  money
wisely. Already provinces have risen to the challenge  by  putting  measures
in place, such as treatment, care, prevention, education and  training,  and
research programmes.

Under the aforementioned categories, provinces  have  run  social  awareness
campaigns, have had condom distribution  programmes,  capacitated  community
members  with  regard  to   home-based   care,   launched   local   HIV/Aids
counsellors,  embarked  on  ongoing  training  of  health   profession   and
community members with regard to voluntary counselling and testing,  piloted
sites  in  almost  all  provinces  for  the   prevention-of-mother-to-child-
transmission  programme  services  and  introduced  improved   life   skills
programmes  in  schools,  among  other  endeavours.  The  list  is  endless.
Obviously, with the increase in the HIV/Aids budget,  these  programmes  are
expected to both increase in number and intensify in deliverables.

I would like to congratulate the MEC of the Northern Cape for giving us  the
information on the gender focal point because, with  regard  to  the  gender
focal point in the department, most provinces reported that contrary to  the
National Policy Framework for Women's Empowerment and  Gender  Equality  and
the national Department of  Health's  gender  policy  commitment,  provinces
were not paying sufficient attention to this vital function.

The  GFP  bears  the  responsibility  of  supporting  and   monitoring   all
directorates  and  institutions  in  identifying   and   addressing   gender
inequality or inequity. It is therefore an obligation on  all  sectors  that
they  have  fully  functioning  provincial  and  local  GFPs  to  assist  in
fostering gender awareness, lead the process for developing  health  sector-
specific indicators,  conduct  health  sector-specific  analysis  on  gender
disparities, and to develop a comprehensive sector plan, amongst others.

From the provincial hearings, it appeared that  these  gender  focal  points
did not have sufficient support in all  provincial  health  departments.  In
many provinces there was only one person allocated who would raise an  alarm
around gender issues within the Department of Health. Clearly,  we  need  to
improve on this phenomenon.

The GFPs need to able  to  give  input  and  participate  in  gender-related
issues. They should be allocated at the heart of management  and  management
decision-making. This means that they should be placed in the office of  the
head of the department at the provincial level. However, the  Department  of
Health has a number of programmes. I have got in front of  me  the  National
Gender Policy and it has policy guidelines.

Also  very  important  is  that  it  promotes  new  attitudes,  values   and
behaviours, and a culture of respect  and  gender  equality  throughout  the
health system - actually promoting the concept of  Batho  Pele.  If  we  can
help in the implementation of this policy,  it  will  actually  improve  the
service that we are getting in our hospitals and in the clinics.

However, the Department of  Health  has  a  number  of  programmes  for  the
improvement of women's health,  which  include  the  reduction  of  maternal
mortality rates, the expansion of the awareness campaigns for  screening  of
cervical and breast  cancer,  termination  of  pregnancy  services  and  the
prevention-of-mother-to-child-transmission programmes, amongst others.  Most
of these programmes are directed through maternal, child and women's  health
directorates.

The challenge of providing reasonable health  service  for  all  remains  an
area in which the Department of Health and all of us  should  work  together
to improve service delivery. We have provided  progressive  legislation  and
policy to bring about health standards that can compete  with  the  best  in
the world, but it is in the area of implementation that  we  need  to  focus
our attention, especially in ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms M N S MANANA (Mpumalanga): Mr Chairperson, hon  Minister  of  Health,  Dr
Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, Deputy Minister of Health, members  of  the  NCOP,
my colleagues, delegates from provinces, ladies and gentlemen ...

... ngithanda ukuqala ngokuhalalisela uNgqongqoshe  wezeMpilo  ngesabiwomali
asethule lapha kule Ndlu. Ngithanda futhi nokumhalalisela ngendlela  aphethe
ngayo umNyango wezeMpilo. Yingakho siphelele sonke lapha singama-MECs  avela
ezifundazweni. Ngisho khona ukuthi sisemuva kwakho  kukho  konke  okwenzayo.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[... I would like to firstly congratulate the  Minister  of  Health  on  the
budget that she has presented here in this  House.  I  would  also  like  to
commend her on the manner in which she is running the Department of  Health.
That's the reason why we are all here as  MECs  from  the  provinces.  I  am
saying that in everything that you do, we are behind you.]

The Director-General of the WHO, in her address to  the  55th  World  Health
Assembly on 13 May 2002, said:


  Forging real change is not easy, you have to confront established ways of
  thinking and working. But if you are convinced, as I am, that  change  is
  essential for our shared purpose, then there is no opportunity  to  yield
  to short-term pressures because this would be the more comfortable way to
  go. I have never seen real change happen easily.  Never  in  history  was
  equity achieved without a battle.
That is why I am not demotivated by facts, but am inspired by the truth.

In the past few years,  we've  been  through  an  exciting  and  challenging
programme of transforming the organs of state both physically  and  mentally
so as to accelerate service delivery. The  public  health  system  has  been
transformed from a racial  one  into  an  integrated  comprehensive  primary
health care system, responding to the needs of the people with a  particular
bias towards historically disadvantaged communities.

Our journey to the provision of quality health care services  has  not  been
an easy one. The manner in which we have carried ourselves has been  a  good
one in responding to the health needs of our electorate.

The previously disadvantaged communities,  especially  the  poor,  know  how
much we have achieved because they know and understand where  we  come  from
and where we are supposed to go. These are the people who never allowed  the
past to deter their conviction that, one day, a better life  for  all  shall
be the order of the day.

Health is brought within the reach of everyone in the community and  implies
the removal of obstacles to health, including, among  others,  malnutrition,
ignorance, an inability to earn a living, poor sanitation, water supply  and
unhygienic habits.

The core responsibility of the Department of  Health  is  to  keep  citizens
healthy in order for them  to  be  productive  members  of  society,  and  a
healthy and secure community is much more  likely  to  be  able  to  play  a
positive role in development. Poverty remains a threat to health for all.

The department will  contribute  and  work  with  other  departments  on  an
intersectoral programme led  by  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs, as the President of this country has indicated that we should  push
back the frontiers of poverty.

With regard to primary health care, the approach remains at  the  centre  of
ANC health policy. More South Africans today have access to health care.  We
have deracialised our clinics  and  hospitals,  built  new  facilities,  and
started  on  the  physical  rehabilitation   of   many   of   the   existing
institutions.  We  must  increase  the  effectiveness  of   our   integrated
comprehensive  health  care,  understanding  the   interconnection   between
poverty, nutrition, clean water, sanitation, hygiene and health.

I would like to announce to  this  House  that  the  Mpumalanga  College  of
Nursing has been accredited by the South African Nursing  Council  to  train
the post basic course in primary health care. The  training  will  start  in
July in this financial year.

Regarding the Integrated Nutrition Programme, in terms of combating  hunger,
the primary school nutrition programme has improved in  sustaining  delivery
over the period of nine years. As a result of this,  the  budget  allocation
for the programme has been increased from R39 million to R62 million.

Concerning HIV/Aids, STI and TB, the department started  with  the  site  in
September 2001. Currently, the programme is available in  20  hospitals  and
19 clinics. We intend to increase the number of sites to 55 by  the  end  of
this financial year.

Voluntary counselling and rapid testing have  been  expanded  to  99  sites.
This financial year we intend increasing voluntary counselling  and  testing
sites to 183. For the promotion  of  the  use  of  condoms  as  a  means  of
empowering women, distribution of female condoms has  been  extended  to  13
sites. The rates of syphilis infections among pregnant women  remain  stable
and this is  due  to  most  clinic  staff  being  trained  in  the  syndrome
management of sexually transmitted infections.  Furthermore,  we  have  also
noted the general increase in the usage of condoms  due  to  an  accelerated
and concerted awareness campaign.

Regarding the partnership campaign, we  have  officially  launched  a  women
partnership against  Aids.  On  5  December,  we  launched  the  traditional
leaders' task team because we believe that traditional leaders  can  play  a
vital role in the fight against Aids. The department is in  the  process  of
launching Mipa - Men in Partnership against Aids - in this  financial  year.
We believe that men can make a difference in  the  fight  against  HIV/Aids.
[Interjections.]

It is an  undeniable  fact  that  tuberculosis  remains  one  of  the  major
challenges facing us. This is due to the fact that the  majority  of  people
still  live  under  conditions  of  poverty.  Hunger  is  a  factor  in  the
interruption of TB treatment.

With regard to cholera, there  were  228  patients  who  were  admitted  and
treated at Tonga and Shongwe hospitals for  diarrhoeal  conditions;  and  91
patients were positively confirmed as having  cholera  and  at  least  three
patients have since died. I  visited  the  hospitals  and  the  area  mostly
affected by cholera, like Block B, on the 12th. I was so  impressed  by  the
dedication and the commitment of the nurses who are  the  backbone  of  this
department. Patients were happy to be nursed by the nurses. I was amazed  by
the  teamwork  displayed  by  the  health  workers,  that  is,  the  medical
managers, doctors, nurses, environmental health officers, health  promoters,
etc. I would like to repeat myself by saying: Thank you once more.  Keep  up
the good work you are doing.

Concerning malaria, in April we participated in a major advocacy and  social
mobilisation initiative known as Race  Against  Malaria.  I  would  like  to
thank professional nurse, Mr Victor Gwebu, who was part of the  convoy  that
drove from South Africa to Dar es  Salaam  on  behalf  of  Mpumalanga.  This
financial year we will continue to use DDT in spraying the households.

With regard to expanding programmes relating to women's health, we  need  to
empower women to take informed decisions about their health and  to  prevent
unwanted pregnancies. We  have  engaged  in  awareness  campaigns  educating
women about  the  health  of  their  bodies  and  the  availability  of  the
termination of unwanted pregnancy services.

On the question of improving child health, it is critical to ensure that  we
set our target of immunisation by implementing the integrated management  of
childhood illnesses programme. [Interjections.]

Before I conclude, I would like to  report  that,  with  regard  to  chronic
health services, the department cares about people  with  disabilities.  The
budget for the provision of assistive devices is increased from  R5  million
to R7,6 million.

In conclusion, I would like to inform this House that  the  construction  of
the new Piet Retief Hospital is progressing well, as is that of  Themba  and
Rob Ferreira. In line with the above, the  total  amount  allocated  to  the
department of health is R2 101 811. For the equitable share, it  is  R1  821
404. For the conditional grant, it's R269 974. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S MOLOTO (Northern  Province):  Chairperson,  the  democratic  Government
has, since its inception in 1994, adopted a primary health  care  policy  as
the backbone of the new health system in the  country.  Lessons  learned  in
the past nine years of democratic rule in  South  Africa  have  consistently
indicated the significance of this policy approach, with  the  building  and
upgrading of more clinics which improve access to health services.

The 2002-03 financial  year  presented  us  with  the  rare  opportunity  to
interact closely with communities  we  serve.  From  April,  health  Letsema
month, various imbizos and road shows were able to  assess  the  impact  and
constraints of our policies from the community's  perspective.  We  listened
judiciously to the complaints and  concerns  raised  by  our  people  during
these interactions. What has been exciting about these interactions  is  the
fact that our people are fully supportive of  the  Government's  policy  and
programmes.   The   people's   concerns   mainly   revolve   around   policy
implementation. This calls into sharp focus the need for us  to  re-engineer
and re-oil our delivery machinery in order to cope  with  the  new  delivery
mechanisms.

We have raised the point before in this House that most  of  the  challenges
which we continue to confront and deal with in the  health  sector  normally
originate and reside in other sectors. These external factors, which have  a
direct bearing on the delivery of quality health services, will include,  as
has been mentioned by the colleagues before me the adequate supply of  water
and  sanitation;  electricity  supply;   a   reliable   road   network   and
infrastructure, and security in our facilities.

These factors are a nightmare in  the  rural  and  underdeveloped  provinces
like  Limpopo,  obviously  the  Eastern  Cape,  and  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the
Northern Cape. At the moment, we are battling with a backlog in  the  supply
of water to about 112 clinics in our province. You can imagine that if  even
an important public facility like a clinic or school is without an  adequate
water supply, what about the communities themselves? We have been  fortunate
that, in the past rainy season in  Limpopo,  we  have  not  experienced  any
cholera outbreaks  like  in  the  previous  seasons.  We  believe  that  our
community  mobilisation  and  general  health   promotion   programmes   are
beginning to take root and are being internalised by our people.

We have seen a gradual increase  in  our  immunisation  coverage  since  the
adoption of a primary health care policy. It  is  not  surprising  that  the
younger generation may not know much about  the  diseases  which  have  been
haunting our people even though they are preventable. There is a  remarkable
reduction in the incidence of small pox, measles, polio and others.

This is one achievement we are overlooking  as  a  nation  as  a  reason  to
celebrate because, in the past  few  years,  these  diseases  were  imposing
untold misery on the lives  of  our  people.  We  hold  a  view  that  as  a
Government and a nation we are more  susceptible  to  the  dictates  of  our
detractors whose aim is to derail us and make us focus  somewhere  else.  It
is time that we count our achievements and join our  people  in  celebrating
the achievements of our democracy.

The  major  challenge  which  we  need  to  overcome  in  relation  to   our
immunisation programme is the break in the cold  chain  as  our  electricity
supply in the rural areas has not, as yet, reached every  facility  and,  in
some instances, the supply is not that reliable.

One of the issues which our people constantly raise and  complain  about  in
the various forums has always been the issue  of  ambulances  and  emergency
services. In our province, we have been trying to cope with the  demand  for
fleet replacement and proper management. The state of our road  network  and
infrastructure has proven to be the major obstacle  in  the  realisation  of
this goal. In some instances, the new fleet does not survive for  more  than
six months and the vehicles will then be parked in  the  state  garage.  The
question which we are constantly asking ourselves is whether we  should  not
concentrate on the provision of a proper road  infrastructure  in  order  to
keep our emergency service vehicles, that is ambulances  and  other  support
services,  on  the  road  longer.  We  remain  convinced  that   the   fleet
replacement route is  not  a  sustainable  solution  to  this  problem.  The
problem of the road infrastructure also  affects  the  provision  of  mobile
services to the rural communities and the outlying farming areas.

There have always been two factors which impact on our ability to provide  a
24-hour service in our clinics. One is the shortage  of  personnel  and  the
other is the provision of adequate security. As has been  mentioned  by  the
colleagues before me, many of our nurses are continually threatened,  mugged
and even raped in  clinics  whilst  on  night  duty.  Besides  adequate  and
appropriate staff numbers, the issue of security provision  in  our  clinics
stands out as one of the obstacles which prevent access  to  primary  health
care services in our province. We have decided to  allocate  funds  for  the
provision of at least one armed security guard  for  24  hours  in  all  our
clinics this financial year. The number of guards  will  increase  depending
on the risk assessment from area to area.

We cannot agree more with the  assertion  made  by  the  President  when  he
called for a development which is integrated. The  issues  of  intersectoral
and multisectoral collaboration in development cannot be overemphasised.

We have previously used this platform to raise an issue which  continues  to
be a nightmare in the health sector, and I think my colleagues have  already
alluded to it. There is a shortage of health care professionals in  most  of
our  facilities.  The  staff  provision  in  the  country  follows  resource
allocation and development patterns. It is common knowledge that  there  are
still inequities in our  resource  allocation.  The  2003  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review reflects a per capita expenditure on health for Gauteng at  R1
668, while Limpopo stands at R627. That is a difference of more than  double
what Limpopo is spending on health. Surely this type of situation cannot  be
allowed to continue lest, like my colleagues said, the  poor  will  have  to
continue voting with their feet. We will continue to call for the review  of
the equitable share formula.

We are succeeding in making our facilities and service points  cost  centres
in order to improve our management systems. We have appointed CEOs  in  most
of our hospitals and both our human resources and financial management  have
improved  tremendously.  These  managers  are  confronting  the  issues   of
corruption, fraud and theft head-on. We have also  seen  an  improvement  in
management of repairs and maintenance.

Despite the challenges and constraints we have alluded to, we are  confident
that we are on the right path. We have  gradually  been  seeing  our  health
indicators becoming more comparable with the  more  endowed  provinces  like
the Western Cape.  This  is  one  factor  which  motivates  us  to  continue
persevering.

Important issues have been raised and I deliberately ignored the  temptation
to respond to the issues raised. Let me state that I am going to be  quoting
someone who is a very notorious person these days, a person I  am  not  very
comfortable quoting, but I am inspired by the essence of  the  statement  he
makes. That person is Tony Blair. Tony Blair once said that if he could  not
get his national health system right, he would quit  office  before  he  was
pushed out. I think the essence of this statement  tells  us  how  important
health is, if you look at Britain and how it  has  developed  as  a  nation.
[Applause.]

Mr A E BALOYI (North West): Chairperson, hon Minister Dr  Manto  Tshabalala-
Msimang, hon MECs and hon members of the NCOP, let me  present  to  you  the
report from the North West  province's  department  of  health.  I  am  here
representing the MEC, Dr Sefolaro, who  is  out  of  the  country  on  other
governmental matters. I stand  here  to  support  the  policy  direction  on
health as presented by the Minister of Health, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.
Indeed, the ANC-led Government is on track in accelerating service  delivery
in line with the RDP which emanated from the Freedom Charter of 1955.

Let me give the profile in terms of the North West province. The  population
of the province is around  3,4  million.  We  have  four  districts  and  22
subdistricts. The outline and guidelines forwarded to  us  are  as  follows:
provincial health services in  terms  of  the  overview  background,  health
services   priority   programmes,   expenditure   patterns   and   budgetary
allocations for 2003-04 and pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

Allow me to put our strategic  goals  as  a  department:  providing  quality
health care and accessible, equitable and affordable  comprehensive  primary
health  care  services  and  well-functioning   and   competitive   hospital
services, and  improving  the  health  status  of  communities  through  the
implementation of what we call integrated health  programmes.  The  list  is
endless.

I am going to highlight strategic issues for budgetary considerations  which
emanated from the President's speech and the  Minister  of  Finance,  Trevor
Manuel, in terms of poverty eradication, HIV/Aids, the equipment budget  and
partnership with local government structures.

Of course, in terms of Black Economic Empowerment through the SMMEs  and  in
line  with  the  macroeconomic  strategy,  in  terms  of  the   preferential
procurement policy framework, medicine procurement, home affairs  and  birth
registrations, combating of crime and the Skills Development  Act  of  1998,
the list is endless.

In terms of pushing back the frontiers of poverty,  in  terms  of  household
food security, income-generating projects through small-scale  farming,  NGO
and CBO sector approach,  access  to  health  services  and  supplies,  PSNP
benefits children  and  women.  The  scheme  targets  severely  malnourished
children and TB patients.

In terms of incoming-generating projects, of  course,  we  have  implemented
small-scale farming in Ventersdorp and other centres so as  to  benefit  the
youth, women, disabled and the larger communities.

I have an overlapping document here. Please pardon me.

In terms  of  HIV/Aids  and  STI,  the  male  urethral  discharge  incidents
decreased from 3% to 2,8%. The syphilis prevalence rate remains at  4%.  The
HIV prevalence rate among antenatal clinic attenders  increased  from  22,9%
in 2001 to 25,2% in 2002. Also, in  terms  of  HIV/Aids  and  STI,  we  have
established 322 VCT sites and they are functional. About 1 310  nurses  were
trained in rapid testing and 664 were trained in counselling.

In terms of PMTCT, we have increased from 2 to 89 and, in  terms  of  health
care workers, we have trained about 392. Out of 82 children tested  for  HIV
at nine months, only nine were found to be HIV-positive.

With regard to decentralisation, we have completed what we  call  the  PSNP,
and we have implemented the  programme  accordingly  in  terms  of  national
standards. In 2002, it reached 85% of targeted children as  opposed  to  58%
in 2001. More than 660 women  groups  benefited  from  this  initiative.  Of
course, the income was about R5 000.

In relation to oral health services, the number of outreach clinics  visited
increased by 30% and prevention services have increased by 35%.  Twenty  new
fully-equipped  surgeries  with  state-of-the-art  equipment   were   opened
between 2001-02, 80% of them in rural areas.

In terms of our capital project achievement, for  the  HR  and  R  projects,
doctors reside in three district hospitals, for  example,  Schweizer-Reneke,
Ventersdorp and Jurie. There is a medical  psychiatric  unit  in  Taung  and
there are maternity units, a laundry, kitchen and boilers  in  the  Mafikeng
complex.

I think we have  some  challenges  in  terms  of,  firstly,  human  resource
development and what we call interdepartmental collaboration. There  is  the
unavailability of doctors when it comes to the doctor-patient  ratio.  There
is  inequality  in  capital  spending  with  specific  reference  to   other
provinces. We need to review this particular matter, hon Minister.

We have a lack of health facilities in rural  areas.  There  are  inadequate
facilities for HIV/Aids campaigns and we are doing little about that.

Batho ba a tlhokofala. [People are dying.]

In conclusion, let me take this opportunity to thank the  Minister  and  the
support staff of the Health department.  Hon  Minister,  keep  up  the  good
work. We support you. [Applause.]

Mr P MEYER (Western Cape):  Deputy  Chairperson,  before  I  start  with  my
prepared speech I would like  to  register  my  deepest  sympathy  with  the
family of Dineo Thuledi, a female security guard who was shot and killed  at
one of our health care centres on  1  June  2003  in  Khayelitsha.  I  would
further also like to inform the Council that an awaiting-trial prisoner,  Mr
Johannes van Rooyen, an inmate at the Valkenberg Psychiatric  Hospital,  was
found in the ceiling where he had been hiding since Friday afternoon.

National Minister of Health, Dr Manto  Tshabalala-Msimang,  Deputy  Minister
Schoeman, fellow MECs, members of the Council, I rise to support the  budget
of the hon Minister. I wish to use this opportunity  to  share  the  Western
Cape's view on health priorities, the  Western  Cape's  expenditure  pattern
and the provincial allocation for 2003-04, and health  programmes  aimed  at
pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

Health services in the Western Cape are famous for  their  achievements.  At
the same time, the services are subject to severe  budget  constraints,  and
we have to work very hard to make  ends  meet.  I  believe  that  an  urgent
debate is required in South  Africa  to  determine  the  minimum  acceptable
levels of health service and funding.

In view of an increased burden of diseases, the Western Cape identified  the
following health matters to be among our priorities for the following  year:
fetal alcohol syndrome; diseases of lifestyle - diabetes  and  hypertension;
tuberculosis - especially the combination of TB and HIV/AIDS; mental  health
and patients on treatment  prescriptions  for  chronic  medication.  Waiting
times are increased and  drug  shortages  occur,  which  complicates  health
matters for this province.

Restructuring of the health service is another priority.  Health  management
realised that we could not continue to deliver the service in the manner  of
the past, and our current budget  provides  for  the  new  approach  towards
health service delivery as contained in our Health Care 2010 Policy  in  the
Western Cape. Health Care 2010 was approved by the Western  Cape  provincial
government in March 2003, and contains 10 important  initiatives  to  enable
Health to provide an improved quality service, which is  accessible  to  all
citizens of the Western Cape  and  beyond.  These  are:  clarity  on  health
services to be delivered at all levels of care; agreement  on  the  location
of facilities; revision of the staff establishment; replacement of  obsolete
equipment; development of standard  treatment  guidelines;  preparing  clear
referral  guidelines;  upgrading  of   the   emergency   medical   services;
stimulating health promotion; restructuring of the service  for  chronic  TB
and mental health patients, and aligning the budget with  Health  Care  2010
and the department's strategic plan.

During 2003-04, my management team will  address  24  crosscutting  priority
projects. The total health budget for 2003-04 is R4,29 billion.  The  health
budget constitutes 26,2% of the provincial budget. We  shall  spend  62%  on
staff salaries.

I would like to spell out the challenges and pressures  in  the  budget  for
2003-04. If expenditure for the previous financial year was  projected  into
2003-04, and the effects of inflation factored in,  my  department  faces  a
theoretical shortfall of more than R100 million. The budget  for  drugs  and
medical consumables is under enormous pressure, particularly  in  the  large
teaching hospitals like Groote Schuur and Tygerberg.

I cannot therefore categorically pledge that my department will be  able  to
remain within the allocated budget if we are to meet our obligations to  the
people of the Western Cape. Something will have to give.

Some health programmes, such  as  the  Integrated  Nutrition  Programme  and
programmes for the disabled,  aim  to  alleviate  poverty  directly.  It  is
therefore vital that  health  provides  for  these  in  our  budget.  Health
services to pregnant women and children under the age  of  six  and  primary
health care are already provided free of charge.

Die  nasionale  Minister  van  Gesondheid  het  op  13  Mei  2003  in   haar
begrotingstoespraak aangekondig dat mense wat permanent gestremd is, én  dit
daartoe lei dat hulle matig  tot  ernstige  probleme  ondervind  om  normale
lewenstake uit te voer, later vanjaar  in  aanmerking  sal  kom  vir  gratis
mediese sorg. Hierdie diens sal nie gratis beskikbaar wees aan  diegene  met
mediese fondse, diegene wat tydelik gestremd is nie,  en  chroniese  siektes
wat nie aansienlike verlies aan funksionele vermoë skep nie.

My Departement van Gesondheid in die Wes-Kaap sal  met  betrekking  tot  die
gratis sorg vir gestremdes verantwoordelik  wees  vir  die  verskaffing  van
vervangbare toestelle, soos brille, en  vir  bystand  aan  nuwe  gestremdes.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The national Minister of Health announced in her budget speech  on  13  May
2003 that people who are permanently disabled,  where  this  leads  to  them
experiencing moderate to serious  problems  in  executing  normal  tasks  in
life, will be considered  for  free  medical  care  later  this  year.  This
service will not be available to those with medical  aid  funds,  those  who
are temporarily disabled, and those who have chronic diseases  that  do  not
create a considerable loss of functional ability.

My department of health in the Western Cape will,  in  regard  to  the  free
care for the disabled, be  responsible  for  the  provision  of  replaceable
equipment, such as spectacles, and for aid to people who have  become  newly
disabled.]

The Western Cape will receive a conditional grant of R34,6 million  for  the
Integrated Nutrition Programme during 2003-04. We managed to  feed  158  000
children attending 881 schools during the course of 2002-03, and  we  intend
to reach at least 147 578 learners at 861 schools during 2003-04.

Health, as hon members know, is complex. For this  current  financial  year,
the budget which I presented to the Western Cape  legislature  will  buy  in
essence the following for the  people  of  the  Western  Cape:  nurse-driven
primary health care services for  more  than  3  million  residents  of  the
province  in  242  fixed  and  130  mobile  clinics;  medical  practitioner-
supported primary  health  care  services  offering  more  than  12  million
patient contacts per year; admission for more than 180 000 patients and  450
000 outpatient visits  at  36  level  1  hospitals;  reduced  prevalence  of
HIV/Aids through various programmes  including  PMTCT  and  VCT  programmes;
increased cure  rates  for  tuberculosis  and  supplementary  food  for  all
eligible primary school children for the 170 days of the school year.

It will also include: emergency medical services provided by  trained  staff
in fully equipped EMS vehicles that cover 14 million  kilometres  per  year;
specialist care in 9 regional and four psychiatric hospitals that admit  166
000 patients each year and highly specialised care for 950 000  patients  in
central or academic hospitals. This includes 118  000  admissions  from  the
Western Cape and 94 000 patients from other provinces at the  Groote  Schuur
Hospital, Tygerberg and Red Cross.

Please  be  assured  that  the  Western  Cape  health  department  will   do
everything in its power to tackle its responsibilities towards  the  poorest
of the poor, ensuring that a quality health service is rendered to  all  the
citizens of the Western Cape and beyond.

We shall continue to strive towards: "Better care  for  better  health,  all
day, every day." I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, health  involves  the
whole sum of a human being, which has spirit, body and soul. If you talk  of
health, you think of  conditions  of  living  which  have  to  be  improved.
Section 27 of our Constitution says:


 (1)  Everyone has the right to have access to -


       (a)  health care services, including reproductive health care;


       (b)  sufficient food and water; and


       (c)  social security,  including,  if  they  are  unable  to  support
           themselves and their dependants, appropriate social assistance.


 (2)  No one may be refused emergency medical treatment.

The President in his statement of January 8 addressed to the ANC said that:


  ... our  movement  long  recognised  the  fact  that  good  health  is  a
  fundamental requirement of a better quality of life. Many of  our  people
  are victims to diseases of poverty. We must  adopt  a  comprehensive  and
  balanced approach to the challenge of providing health for all, based  on
  a more accurate understanding of the incidence of disease in our country.

It is true that in order to improve the quality of our  lives,  we  need  to
tackle all setbacks including poverty, segregation and so on. Hunger  brings
instability and vulnerability to diseases. In our country we  have  terrible
scourges, which are  tuberculosis,  malaria,  cholera  and  HIV/Aids,  which
increase the mortality  rate  of  our  people.  More  children  are  orphans
because of these pandemics.

Indeed, our Minister once said that we have fought many wars and  won  them,
and we will win this battle. Today, she  reported  that  there  is  a  great
improvement in combating  this  pandemic.  Health,  as  it  relates  to  the
wellbeing of individuals, brings knowledge together. Knowledge  is  to  know
both what one knows and what one does not know.  It  makes  our  minds  work
together.  It  brings  attention   to   all,   irrespective   of   political
affiliation, race or gender. Instead of attacking  our  Minister  every  now
and then in the media, we need to  be  contributing  positively  to  ridding
ourselves of these scourges, and give our suggestions. There is a  lot  that
has been done by the Government and we need to congratulate our Minister  on
that.
To ensure quality services, which is the basis of any equitable  sustainable
health care programme, and to ensure sustainability  to  enhance  motivation
and  certify  ownership,  health  facilities  must  be  part  of  a  quality
improvement process. The apartheid regime  in  South  Africa  established  a
fragmented health service which lacked the strategic approach and  community
involvement needed to ensure high-quality care. We have policies  and  other
measures have been introduced. There is a  progressive  realisation  of  the
right to health care services. We are conforming therefore to  international
best practice and the Human Rights Commission report of 2000-02 agrees  with
that.

Implementation is still the biggest challenge. A lot of  clinics  have  been
built, but the question of accessibility to  them  is  still  a  problem  in
rural areas. Roads still need to  be  built  to  access  these  clinics.  At
times, when it rains, no one can walk on those roads. It is still a  problem
for the people who are working. I am talking about the closing times of  the
clinics.  Even  during  weekends,  people  who  are  working  cannot  access
clinics.

Implementation of the national HIV/Aids/TB syndrome  intervention  programme
provides services to the youth and women. The expansion of services  through
the use of mobile clinics has promoted the right to health care,  especially
in rural areas.  The  Equity  Project  is  a  package  which  defines  basic
standards, personnel, equipment and suppliers needed at each  level  of  the
health system. Community involvement improves the  working-together  spirit.
We need to help our Government in any way we can.

The Equity  Project  partners  have  improved  clinical  skills  to  deliver
primary, secondary and tertiary health care services  through  training  and
technical assistance. It also  addressed  transport  challenges  to  improve
effective delivery of priority programmes. There are women  in  rural  areas
who have skills in delivering children, who  are  not  recognised.  Children
are born at home through the assistance of  the  women  with  these  skills.
When their mothers have to get their birth certificates at Home Affairs,  it
becomes a problem because this is not recognised at all. Is  there  any  way
of recognising these skills? For example,  accreditation  should  be  looked
into.

Most of our health care workers do not want to work  in  rural  communities.
We need to look into the question of  incentives.  The  question  of  nurses
who, after being trained by the Government free of charge,  go  overseas  is
also  a  question  that  needs  to  be  looked  into.  We  need  a   serious
investigation into this and to improve the  quality  of  standards  so  that
they stay in our country. Stringent measures need  to  be  taken.  Contracts
need to be signed, which will bind them to doing  their  work  here.  It  is
therefore heartening to learn that the department has  a  budget  allocation
of R500 million for recruitment and  training  of  health  professionals  to
serve in rural areas, as the Minister said today. This allocation will  also
address the question of incentives, which I talked  about  earlier.  As  the
Minister puts it, the international brain drain has been addressed as  there
will now be laws regarding professional nurses.

We had visits from provinces on budgeting issues. Limpopo reported that  the
equitable share formula from  Dora  dictates  that  19%  of  the  provincial
allocation has to be given to health. The Department of  Education  and  the
Department of Social Welfare ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Are you the Deputy Chair? I want to know so  that  I
can address you correctly. Are  you  the  Chair  of  Chairs?  [Laughter.]  I
honestly want to say thank you to all who have participated in  this  debate
and those who listened patiently to the debate. I think it  has  been  quite
an exciting debate.

Just listening to the debate this afternoon,  a  thought  crossed  my  mind,
particularly  when  listening  to  the  achievements  of   the   department,
particularly  in  the  provinces.  I  just  wondered  what   the   apartheid
Parliament used to debate, particularly on the health budget,  if  you  take
into  account  the  backlogs  that  we  inherited  from  them.  I  was  just
wondering. I can't believe that they spent an afternoon like  this  debating
a health budget. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] But I  am  sure  you  used  to
listen.

Of course you heard that we did not shy away from challenges that  we  face.
We will confront these head-on. I am happy that all of us  have  heard  from
the MECs what is happening in the various provinces. I  think  you  can  see
for yourselves that we are trying our best to provide  quality  health  care
services to our people. I also hope that you have noted the  interprovincial
inequities, which we must continue to address.  In  spite  of  all  this,  I
think you have gotten a sense  that  we  are  trying  our  best  to  deliver
quality health care services to our people.

There are a number of things that seem to flow  from  the  presentations  by
the MECs. I think these are about, for example, narrowing the gap  in  terms
of equity and resource allocation. It seems to  me  that  in  improving  the
equity, it may also help - I hope that the NCOP colleagues  here  will  help
us in this regard - to challenge  provinces  not  to  reduce  health  budget
allocations from equitable shares, whilst the conditional  grants  increase,
because that does not help us. I hope we will monitor  that  as  members  of
the NCOP. But, also, we need  to  continually  ensure  that  interprovincial
equity is also prioritised. I am hoping that the  members  of  this  Chamber
will assist us in this regard.

I think another priority that came out in the debate is that  of  recruiting
and retaining our human resources. I will not elaborate on this,  because  I
dealt at length with this issue. The other one was  the  revitalisation  and
maintenance to our health care facilities. I think another area  which  most
of the MECs referred to was the emergency medical  services.  The  last  one
which also seems central to our debate is  the  improvement  of  quality  of
health care services that we deliver  to  our  people  to  ensure  that  our
patients are treated with respect and dignity.

I just want to acknowledge, in particular, the point that was raised  by  Ms
Themba regarding the importance of the gender focal points and the  need  to
mainstream  gender   issues   into   the   health   policy   and   programme
implementation. I hope that the  NCOP  will  monitor  the  establishment  of
gender desks in all our provinces to ensure that  they  are  structured  and
placed appropriately. I am  hoping  that  this  is  something  that  we  can
discuss with MECs on Friday  in  our  Minmecs,  so  that  I  get  first-hand
information as to how the gender focal points are functioning.

There are just two last things that I want to refer to. As you know,  on  23
May, by consensus, we adopted the Framework Convention on  Tobacco  Control.
I must pay tribute  to  our  negotiators,  particularly  from  our  country,
because I think they played a very important role in  ensuring  that  Africa
always, in every debate and discussion, had  one  voice.  We  spoke  in  one
voice. I think, in  this  regard,  I  would  like  to  honestly  single  out
Advocate Patricia Lambert, because she stood in for me and chaired  all  the
sessions. I think that, with her able navigation of  the  process,  we  were
able by  consensus  to  even  influence  the  United  States  to  adopt  the
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. [Applause.]

I just want to announce that 16 June - of course, as South Africans we  were
very clever; we chose this date because, as we all know,  it  is  our  Youth
Day, and it was thus that we decided to influence the World Health  Assembly
-  has  been  designated  as  the  date  on  which  to  sign  the  framework
convention.  We  will  be  travelling  to  Geneva  to  sign  the   framework
convention. I will be taking with me two young  people  to  demonstrate  our
focus on the youth of our country with regard to tobacco control. I  wish  I
had money to take one from each province, but it  is  not  possible  because
the funds don't allow me to do so unless, of  course,  the  members  of  the
NCOP will donate money so that each province ... [Laughter.]

The last thing that I would like to say is that, on  6  June  this  year  we
signed  the  agreement  with  the  Global  Fund  for  the  malaria   control
programme. I am sure that it is going to please most of us in this  Chamber.
The primary recipient of the funds is the MRC. As you know,  this  programme
includes Swaziland, South Africa and Mozambique.  So  we  are  very  excited
that we were able to sign this agreement with the Global  Fund.  [Applause.]
Thank you very much. May I say that you  are  all  invited  for  a  Chakoda.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

                       JUDICIAL MATTERS AMENDMENT BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee thereon)

Mr R M NYAKANE: Thank you, Chair. I am  instructed  by  hon  members  to  be
kort. [brief] I am going to be kort. Chairperson and hon members, I rise  to
table this statement in respect of the Bill before  us,  on  behalf  of  the
Select Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development. I table it  with
a full understanding that not a single member was opposed to the passage  of
this Bill during our interrogation of the Bill.

The amendments before us are aimed  at  correcting  deficiencies  that  have
arisen in practice and giving effect to Government policy,  especially  with
regard to the advancement and empowerment of the  previously  disadvantaged.
In order to address the  imbalances  that  exist  with  the  appointment  of
trustees, liquidators,  judicial  managers,  and  similar  functionaries  in
solvency related matters, and in  order  to  actively  advance  and  empower
previously disadvantaged people,  in  line  with  Government  policies,  the
Department of Justice and Constitutional Development is developing a  policy
on the procedures for the appointment of these functionaries.

The aims of the policy are, inter alia, creating uniform procedures  in  all
the  Masters'  offices  with  regard  to  the   appointment   of   trustees,
liquidators,  judicial  managers,  and  similar   functionaries;   promoting
consistency, fairness, transparency and achievement of equality for  persons
previously disadvantaged by  unfair  discrimination,  and  thus  making  the
industry accessible to them, and  promoting  the  image  of  the  insolvency
practitioners and the Masters' Division.

We are therefore amending the Insolvency  Act  of  1936,  Companies  Act  of
1973, and Close Corporations Act of 1984 to make it clear  that  the  Master
must act in accordance with policy prescribed by the  Minister  when  making
this appointment. In order to ensure that the policy is developed  with  the
involvement of the role-players, provision is also made for  the  policy  to
be tabled in Parliament before publication. This amendment will ensure  that
there is necessary transparency in the appointment of these functionaries.

The Cabinet member responsible for the administration of Justice appoints  a
Master for each High Court in terms of the Administration  of  Estates  Act,
Act 66 of 1965 and they are obliged to carry out their duties  and  exercise
their powers in terms of this Act, the Insolvency Act  of  1936,  and  other
related legislation. It  is  undesirable  that  each  Master  has  different
approaches and practices  in  respect  of  important  or  highly  publicised
matters such as  the  appointment  of  trustees,  liquidators,  and  similar
functionaries in insolvent estates.

We are therefore amending the Administration of Estates Act, 1965,  to  make
provision for the appointment of the Chief Master of the  High  Courts.  The
Chief Master will, as  the  executive  officer  for  the  Masters'  offices,
exercise such supervision over all the Masters' offices as may be  necessary
in order to bring about the required uniformity.

As I said in my introduction, all members of that  committee  agree  to  the
passage of this Bill, unless somebody  decides  to  be  impossible  at  this
particular juncture. Thank you very much. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:39.
