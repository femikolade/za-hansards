                        SUSPENSION OF RULE 110(2)(b)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move:


  That the House suspends Rule 110(2)(b) in regard to the week of 8  to  12
  September 2003  in  order  to  enable  the  Deputy  President  to  answer
  Questions in both the National  Assembly  and  the  National  Council  of
  Provinces during the same week.

Agreed to.

                            WORLD PARKS CONGRESS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the  ANC  congratulates  the
Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism,  and  in  particular  the
outgoing CEO of SA National Parks, Mavuso Msimang, for  hosting  the  first-
ever World Parks Congress to be held in Africa.

We welcome all delegates to our beautiful country. This is a 10-year  event,
convened by the World Conservation Union, the IUCN, and is  a  key  national
event for all  national  parks  and  other  categories  of  protected  areas
throughout the world.  The  theme  of  the  congress  is  ``Benefits  beyond
boundaries''. This theme recognises that protected  areas  cannot  exist  in
isolation, and must be responsive to the  social,  economic,  political  and
cultural needs of society.

In this regard, South Africa has achieved a lot in less than  10  years.  We
have world  heritage  sites,  and  transfrontier  parks  to  boost  economic
activities for communities. This Parliament will  be  passing  the  National
Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill in the coming two weeks.

The ANC  congratulates  the  organisers  of  the  congress,  the  IUCN,  the
delegates of the World Parks Congress for the honour  bestowed  upon  former
President Nelson Mandela at the opening of the congress yesterday.  The  ANC
wishes participants success in their  deliberations,  and  hopes  that  this
conference will contribute positively to the realisation of the  commitments
made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

I wish this Parliament to reaffirm what I  have  just  said,  that  the  one
Creator is in all things, and all things are in one Creator. [Applause.]
        ACCUSATIONS AGAINST NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (DA):  Madam  Speaker,  when  the  Director  of
Public Prosecutions, Bulelani Ngcuka, was appointed in  1998  by  a  Cabinet
that included the then Minister of Transport, Mac Maharaj, the ANC  declared
that he ``had both the ability and the will to help transform  the  judicial
system of our country''.

Now there are senior ANC figures who are parading  accusations  against  the
same  national  director  from  a  decade-old  project  called   ``Operation
Bible''. If these accusations are true, why were they not addressed  at  the
time? Did President Mbeki know about them when he appointed  him?  How  many
other Ministers and members of the executive are also suspected or named  as
being apartheid-era spies?

Curiously,  the  very  people  who  are  supporting  and   flaunting   these
accusations today are themselves being investigated or are connected to  the
very people whom the hon  Ngcuka  has  been  investigating.  They  are  not,
incidentally, asking for a general exposé of apartheid-era spies,  but  they
are uniquely  aiming  at  the  head  of  the  National  Director  of  Public
Prosecutions. They are flouting the provisions of the  National  Prosecuting
Authority Act of 1998,  which  states  that  no  person  ``shall  improperly
interfere with, hinder or obstruct the prosecuting authority''.

The ANC's internal bloodletting and its leaks  and  smears  are  vandalising
the constitutional fabric of this country. It is time  for  President  Mbeki
to lay down the law. He must either  declare  full  confidence  in  the  hon
Ngcuka, whom he handpicked himself, or he must dismiss him on the  basis  of
verifiable accusations. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

                  TRIBUTE TO BISHOP COLENSO AND HIS FAMILY

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Thank you, Madam  Speaker,  it's  Heritage  Month.  I
rise to pay tribute to  that  faithful  woman  of  the  nineteenth  century,
Harriet Emily Colenso, daughter of the first bishop missionary who  came  to
KwaZulu-Natal from London. Bishop Colenso came at a time  when  the  kingdom
of KwaZulu-Natal  was  on  the  verge  of  defeat,  annihilation  and  total
collapse. That was during the reign of King Cetshwayo  and  later  his  son,
King Dinuzulu.

 Harriet, commonly known in  Zulu  circles  as  uDlwedlwe,  because  of  her
height  and  stature,  was  a  woman  of   outstanding   qualities:   brave,
compassionate, loving, committed to the cause of a kingdom under siege.  She
was at the side of King Cetshwayo at the height of British imperialism,  the
Anglo-Zulu war at  iSandlwana,  the  destruction  of  Ulundi  by  fire,  the
incarceration of King Cetshwayo here in the Cape Castle, etc.

To recognise King Dinuzulu as king of the Zulu nation was a mammoth task  to
the British crown until other means were put in place. Harriet was with  the
young king in exile on the island of St Helena, some 5 000 km away from  his
kingdom. King Dinuzulu never enjoyed a moment of peace during his reign,  as
he was exiled a second time to the town of  Middelburg,  where  he  saw  his
last.

Harriet was by his side, all the way, all the time.  Indeed,  Harriet  stood
at the forefront in the Zulu struggle  against  imperialism,  and  her  name
will be remembered for many more generations indeed in the  annals  of  Zulu
history.

Bishop Colenso's family,  and  Harriet  in  particular,  proved  exceptional
devotion to the Zulu royal house when they undertook to ensure the safe  and
dignified return of the body of King Dinuzulu from Middelburg  all  the  way
to the Valley of Emakhosini in Mabanango where he was laid  to  rest.  [Time

                    AWARD FOR HEROIC ACTIONS OF POLICEMEN

                            (Member's Statement)

Nk P N MNANDI(ANC): Somlomo,  ngokudela  izimpilo  zabo  behlenga  abantwana
emlilweni,  iphoyisa  uJacob   Motsepe   nosayitsheni   u-Ernest   Mpolokeng
bangamaqhawe oqobo.  Ngenyanga  kaMandulo  le  esisuka  kuyo,  lama  phoyisa
abikelwa ngunkosikazi ukuthi indoda yayo ibophele embhedeni  abantwana  bayo
abane izandla  nezinyawo  ngenhloso  yokubashisa  nomkhukhu.  Ezwa  ukukhala
kwabantwana endlini eshayo, lama qhawe ephula amawindi angena abakhulula.

Ngalesi senzo esihle lama phoyisa abesehlonishwa nge-debis Fleet  Management
National Emergency Hero of the Year Award. UKhongolose uthi  kuwena  phoyisa
uJacob Motsepe nawe  sayitsheni  u-Ernest  Mpolokeng  sinethulela  izigqoko.
Sithi bambanani njalo nifake isandla  nakhe  lesi  sizwe  sakithi.  Phambili
nezikadalawane, phambili! [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu speech follows.)

[Mrs P N MNANDI  (ANC):  Chairperson,  by  risking  their  lives  to  rescue
children from fire, Constable Jacob Motsepe and  Sergeant  Ernest  Mpolokeng
are real heroes. In August, last month, these policemen were informed  by  a
woman that her husband had tied her four children's hands and  feet  to  the
bed with the intention of burning them along with  the  shack.  Hearing  the
crying voices of the children in the burning shack, these heroes  broke  the
windows and easily jumped in.

For that good act, these policemen were honoured with the  Fleet  Management
National Emergency Hero of the Year Award. The ANC says to  Constable  Jacob
Motsepe and Sergeant Ernest Mpolokeng: ``We  are  taking  our  hats  off  to
you.'' We say: ``Continue co-operating and contributing in the  building  of
our nation. Forward with the police, forward!'' [Applause.]]

                         ARROGANT STANCE OF THE SABC

                            (Member's Statement)

Mev ANNA VAN WYK (Nuwe NP): Mev die Speaker, die SABC moet  nie  sy  rol  as
openbare uitsaaier ondermyn nie. In vanoggend se Cape Times word  berig  dat
die SABC sou gedreig het dat hy dit  sal  oorweeg  om  nie  die  Wêreldbeker
Rugbytoernooi uit te saai nie, as hy nie tevrede is met  die  hantering  van
die rugbyondersoek nie. As openbare uitsaaier bedien  die  SABC  alle  Suid-
Afrikaners en moet die fokus nie val op die uitsaaier  of  sy  amptenare  se
eie agendas nie. Deur sy  optrede  skep  die  SABC  die  indruk  dat  hy  'n
bepaalde sportsoort dreig. Die vraag is of die raad van die  SABC,  wat  die
publiek verteenwoordig, in hierdie  saak  geken  is,  voordat  die  openbare
uitsaaier hierdie arrogante standpunt ingeneem het.

Twee sake moet hier geskei word. Eerstens is daar die debat  oor  die  media
se toegang  tot  die  ondersoek.  Tweedens  is  daar  die  kwessie  van  die
uitsaairegte vir die Wêreldbekertoernooi. Die SABC doen sy  saak  geen  guns
deur  die  twee  by  mekaar  te  betrek  nie.  Die  openbare  uitsaaier  kan
toekomstige verhoudinge net skade berokken, nadat dit so lank geduur het  om
die hele debat oor sportuitsendings op te los, om dié uitsendings  aan  alle
Suid-Afrikaners beskikbaar te maak.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK (New NP): Madam Speaker, the  SABC  should  not  undermine
its role as the public broadcaster. In  this  morning's  Cape  Times  it  is
reported  that  the  SABC  has  apparently  threatened   to   consider   not
broadcasting the Rugby World Cup tournament if it is not satisfied with  the
handling of the rugby investigation. As  the  public  broadcaster  the  SABC
serves all South Africans, and the  focus  should  not  be  on  the  private
agendas of the broadcaster or its officials. Through its  conduct  the  SABC
is creating the impression that it is  threatening  a  specific  sport.  The
question is whether the board of the SABC, which represents the public,  has
been consulted with regard to this matter,  before  the  public  broadcaster
adopted this arrogant stance.

A distinction should be drawn between two matters here.  Firstly,  there  is
the debate about the media's access to the  investigation.  Secondly,  there
is the issue of broadcasting rights in respect of the World Cup  tournament.
The SABC is doing its  cause  any  good  by  linking  the  two.  The  public
broadcaster can only harm future relations, after it had taken  so  long  to
resolve the whole debate about the broadcasting  of  sport,  to  make  these
broadcasts available to all South Africans. [Applause.]]

                  EXCLUSION OF CITIZENS ABROAD FROM VOTING

                            (Member's Statement)

Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP): Madam Speaker, the ACDP believes that the  decision
by the Cabinet, as contained  in  the  Electoral  Laws  Amendment  Bill,  to
exclude South African citizens abroad from voting  in  next  year's  general
election is unconstitutional. According to section 19 of  the  Constitution,
all adult citizens are given  the  right  to  vote  in  elections  in  South
Africa. This right was included  in  the  1994  Electoral  Act,  when  South
African citizens abroad were permitted to vote.

In terms of the present draft, only Government officials  abroad  and  their
families will be permitted to vote. What about the large  numbers  of  South
Africans who are working for South African and other companies overseas,  or
who find themselves overseas for a variety of reasons?  It  is  unacceptable
that no provision has been made for  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  South
African citizens overseas to vote, while awaiting-trial  prisoners  will  be
permitted to vote. The party is taking legal advice in this regard.

The ACDP is also concerned about the delay in the tabling of  the  Electoral
Amendment Bill in Parliament. We believe that the delays in  finalising  the
Bill have  put  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Home  Affairs  under  extreme
pressure and will have  a  negative  effect  on  the  Independent  Electoral
Commission's ability to prepare for next year's elections.

                        TAIWAN AND THE UNITED NATIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (FF): Madam Speaker, I can understand why he wants to be  in
the FF, if one looks at the ANC's problems. Madam Speaker, South Africa  was
one of the few founding members of  the  United  Nations  in  1945.  The  UN
started with 51 original members.  Universal  membership  is  a  fundamental
principle of the UN. Today there are 191 member states.  The  newest  states
include Palau and Tuvaulu with a population of 11 000 people.  The  Republic
of China, Taiwan, is the only country in the  world  that  remains  excluded
from the UN. Taiwan has a population of 23 million people,  that  is  2  000
times the size of the state of Tuvalu. From the 191 countries in the  world,
Taiwan has the world's 17th largest economy with the  world's  15th  largest
trade volume. For the UN to refuse Taiwan membership  of  this  organisation
makes  a  mockery  of  the   universal   membership   principles   of   this
organisation.

The practical result of this decision is that with the  recent  outbreak  of
Sars in Taiwan, the  country  was  excluded  from  the  global  network  for
preventing the spread of  infectious  diseases.  The  FF  is  aware  of  the
arguments and the  dispute  between  the  People's  Republic  of  China  and
Taiwan. Ever since the establishment of  the  PRC,  the  two  sides  of  the
Taiwan strait  have  been  governed  separately,  with  neither  having  any
control or jurisdiction over the other. The UN resolution to accept the  PRC
to   represent   the   Chinese   people   left   Taiwan's   people   without
representation. We want  to  appeal  to  the  South  African  Government  to
support Taiwan's application for membership at the next UN  session  or  not
to take sides on the issue at all.

                           IN MEMORY OF STEVE BIKO

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE (Azapo): Madam Speaker, on 12 September 1977  the  world
was shocked by the announcement of the death in detention  of  Steven  Bantu
Biko. He had been in detention from 6 September 1977. During his short  stay
in detention various conflicting and false statements were  made  about  him
by the then Minister of Justice, Mr Jimmy Kruger. He  proclaimed  that  Biko
had gone on a hunger strike and that it was his democractic right to do  so.
When Biko died, he announced to the world that the death of  Biko  had  left
him cold. Even after his death, the racist settler regime continued  to  lie
about what actually caused his death.

We know what killed Steve Biko: His unquenchable quest  for  true  humanity.
In honour of his everlasting memory Azapo commemorates his  life  and  death
every year from 6-12 September during Biko Week. This week provides us  with
a time to pause and reflect upon his  work,  his  immense  intellectual  and
revolutionary contribution towards the emancipation of black people in  this
country, and his selfless service towards them.

May he forever be remembered for his good work and continue  to  inspire  us
all towards a better society, where all in  this  country  shall  congregate
and celebrate the victory of good over evil. [Applause.]

Mr M E GEORGE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  in  the  by-elections  in  Uitenhage
recently, the ANC recorded a tremendous victory in an area  previously  held
by the DA. [Interjections.]

In the 2000 elections, the DA received 74% of the votes as against  the  18%
of the ANC. This time around, in a massive rejection  of  the  DA,  the  ANC
received 1 305 votes to the DA's paltry 39%  showing.  Once  again,  as  has
been ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Mr M E GEORGE: Once again, as has been typical  of  the  DA,  it  has  cried
foul. They just cannot accept that the people of Uitenhage,  ward  43,  have
rejected them. They prefer to believe their own negative propaganda.

The  voters  have  rejected   the   arrogant   fault-finding-with-everything
attitude of Tony Leon, who specially flew to Uitenhage to address a  bussed-
in small group of people. The people have decided  that  their  future  lies
with the ANC. [Applause.] Congratulations to the ANC and the team  of  hard-
working  volunteers.  The  tide  has  turned.  Thank  you,  Madam   Speaker.
[Applause.]

               COST OF OPERATION OF INKWAZI, PRESIDENTIAL JET

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N CLELLAND-STOKES(DA): Madam Speaker, almost half of all  South  Africans
live on less than R20 a day. Millions of  people  struggle  to  earn  enough
money to give their children even one good  meal  every  day.  However,  the
first six months of the operation of the President's luxury  jet,  according
to the Minister of Defence, cost the people of South Africa  R13,5  million.
[Interjections.]

Now,  that  is  a  damning  indictment  of  the  ANC  Government's  spending
priorities. One flight from Pretoria to Cape Town, on 8  May  -  one  of  17
local flights - cost R124 000 for six passengers, while  a  return  business
class flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town on the  national  carrier  would
have  saved  the  taxpayer  R97  000,  and  that  is  just  on  one  flight.
[Interjections.]
Now, while the DA recognises the need for the  President  to  travel  safely
and efficiently, every effort must be made to limit  the  expenses  incurred
in this regard. At the very very least, the Inkwazi, at  R32  000  an  hour,
should not be used for national and shorthaul international flights.  To  do
so  simply  rubs  salt  into  the  wounds  of  our  people.  [Interjection.]
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

                     THE KILLING OF WOMEN IN ESIKHAWINI

                            (Member's Statement)

Nksz M  XULU  (IFP):  Somlomo,  ngoLwesibili  olwedlule  kwenzeke  isigameko
esishaqisayo, esinyantisa umzimba  ngenkathi  kutholakala  isidumbu  somuntu
wesifazane sicwiyiwe, ezinye izitho zomzimba  wakhe  zisebhodweni  elibilayo
eziko.

Ngokwemibiko yamaphoyisa lesi sidumbu ngesesibili  sowesifazane  sitholakala
kule  ndawo.  Okubuhlungu  kakhulu   ukuzwa   ukuthi   abantu   sebephenduke
izinyamazane ezizingelwa zibulawe bese  zenziwa  isishebo  ngabanye  abantu,
nokuthi lobu bunzima nalobu buzimuzimu bugaqele kakhulu  abantu  abangakwazi
ukuzilwela, njengabantu besifazane.

Sithanda    ukuncoma    amaphoyisa    endawo    eSikhawini    kwaZulu-Natali
ngokuluthathela  phezulu  lolu  daba,  okuphethe  ngokuthi  asheshe  abanjwe
umenzi wobulwane. Siyethemba  futhi  ukuth  lolu  daba  ngeke  lubange  noma
lubhebhethekise inzondo kubantu bokufika kuleli zwe,  ikakhulukazi  njengoba
sazi ukuthi umsolwa uyisakhamuzi saseMozambique.

Lesi sigameko simele  ukugxekwa  yizwe  lonke  ngoba  siphikisana  nomthetho
wamalungelo abantu  kanye  nokuhlukunyezwa  kwabesifazane.  Sethemba  ukuthi
abezomthetho bazokwenza  konke  okusemandleni  ukuqinisekisa  ukuthi  umenzi
walobu  bubi  uthola  isijeziso   esimfaneleyo,   nokuqinisekisa   ukuphepha
kwabantu bakuleyo ndawo, ikakhulukazi abesifazane  nezingane  njengoba  sazi
ukuthi yibona abantu bokuqala izigangi eziganga ngabo. (Translation of  Zulu
member’s statement follows.)

[Miss M XULU (IFP): Speaker, last Tuesday a  shocking  incident  took  place
when a woman's body was found mutilated and some of her body parts  were  in
a boiling pot.

According to the police report, this is the second body of  a  woman  to  be
found in this area. What is even more painful is the fact that  people  have
become wild animals that are being hunted and killed, and they are  becoming
meals. This problem and cannibalism are directed particularly at people  who
are defenceless, like women.

We would like to commend the local police at eSikhawini, KwaZulu-Natal,  for
prioritising  this  matter,  which  resulted  in  the  apprehension  of  the
culprit. We also hope that this incident  will  not  create  hatred  towards
immigrants in this country, as we know that  the  suspect  is  a  Mozambican
citizen.

This incident should be condemned by the  country  as  a  whole  because  it
contravenes the legislation on human rights and the abuse of women. We  hope
that law enforcement authorities will do their  best  to  ensure  that  this
evil man gets the punishment he deserves, and that  they  will  also  ensure
the safety of the people of that area, particularly women and  children,  as
they are the first people to get hurt.]

[Mr L J MODISENYANE (ANC): Madam Speaker, allow me to give  this  honourable
House this short report: On 27 August 2003, in ward 2 of  Bethlehem  in  the
Free State, the competition between the ANC, PAC, BOCA and IFP  became  very
tight during the by-elections. The ANC polled 87%  of  the  votes,  and  the
other parties shared the remaining 13%. The DA did not even bother to  stand
in the elections. [Laughter.]

On 17 September 2003 by-elections will be held in the ward  3  of  the  same
town. But the PAC, BOCA  and  IFP  have  emulated  the  DA  by  not  sending
candidates for their parties. Therefore the ANC will  go  to  the  elections
without any competition. This clearly shows that there is no other  champion
in the Free State. Without any doubt the ANC is going to  win  the  national
as well as the provincial elections without any problems  next  year.  Those
parties that will try  to  challenge  it  will  fail  dismally.  [Laughter.]

            IDENTIFICATION OF SUITABLE CLOTH FOR SCHOOL UNIFORMS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M E OLCKERS (New NP): Madam Speaker, in the light of the  recent  speech
by the hon Deputy  Minister  of  Education  and  the  statement  after  that
occasion pertaining to school uniforms, the New NP  would  like  to  suggest
that a team of say three experts on cloth qualities be asked to  identify  a
suitable cloth for school uniforms and that that cloth be made available  in
six or eight colour dyes so as to enable the governing bodies to  decide  on
a colour for the school with the badges and identification of that  specific
school. That would still enable the schools to have a colour of  uniform  of
their choice for identification and competition, but  no  one  uniform  will
cost more than the other and the look of not  everyone  being  in  the  same
colour will lead to more individuality than a mass of learners all over  the
country all dressed in the same colour uniform.

School uniforms cannot be done away  with  because  that  would  lead  to  a
greater competition to dress in brand names which will be more expensive  or
it could lead to an untidy and unkempt look of casualness  in  our  schools.
If other countries allow it, so be it. In South Africa we want our  learners
to have a feeling of belonging  and  being  part  of  a  team  and  we  must
encourage that.

                                PHARMACY WEEK

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L V J NGCULU (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC welcomes initiatives  such  as
Pharmacy Week. We congratulate the Department of Health, the  Pharmaceutical
Society of SA and the South African Pharmacy Council  for  their  collective
efforts in bringing across the message, ``Pharmacy - making  medicines  work
for you! Together we can!''

We have always understood the importance of providing  affordable  drugs  to
our people, especially those  who  are  poor  and  cannot  afford  expensive
medication. All our efforts over the past nine years and especially  through
the passage of the Medicines and Related Substances Control  Act  have  been
to  provide  communities,  even  those  in  the  remote  rural  areas,  with
affordable essential drugs of good quality.

In Pharmacy Week the focus will be on building  a  partnership  between  the
patient and the pharmacist. The public in general is encouraged to  approach
their local pharmacists and  engage  with  them  on  all  issues  concerning
medicine but especially on the medication they  are  currently  taking,  the
need to take them, their side effects and  information  on  cheaper  generic
brands  delivering  the  same  benefit.  The  ANC  encourages  everyone   to
participate in Pharmacy Week. [Applause.]

                               SCHOOL UNIFORMS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I would have  liked  to  reply  to
the ACDP on the exclusion of foreigners. The largest cluster, of course,  is
the Cabinet, but I would deprive myself if I do not  to  refer  to  the  hon
Olckers' statement  about  school  uniforms.  I  corrected  immediately  the
mispresentation of the Deputy Minister about the abolition of uniforms.

This is a matter that when we publish the funding of schools, we  said  that
we must look at the question of the cost of uniforms. And  we  have  a  body
looking into it. It is a very complex matter. We need to look at it  in  its
entirety - as to the production, distribution, exclusive  arrangements  with
the shops, and as to whether our people can manage to  buy  these  expensive
uniforms.

So I suggest to the New NP, through the hon Olckers, to submit its  proposal
which we will look at. Of course we must  remember  that  uniforms  are  not
worn in most countries of the world. And that is why we have a  case  as  to
why we need uniforms. I am sure that the case can be  made  because  I  just
came back from overseas, and  I  found  in  comparison  with  our  education
system that no European country has uniforms. The  United  States  does  not
have uniforms either, whether in the government or private schools.

But I think that we need to look at this  afresh.  There  will  be  a  case,
undoubtedly, in the South African context, for  uniforms,  but  not  to  the
extent in which they cost R3 000, R4  000  or  R5  000  for  one  child.  In
addition to that, the football and cricket gear have to be bought  from  one
shop also. I welcome very much submissions from all  16  political  parties,
if they would submit their proposals here. I think  we  must  come  up  with
very sensible, realistic and acceptable proposals, so that governing  bodies
can embrace them with the kind of enthusiasm which removes  the  real  costs
and hardships that middle class families  face  now.  It  is  not  only  the
working class, but poor families - middle class families also face these.  I
think that Parliament should show its best face by making suggestions as  to
how we can improve the situation. Thank you.

            BRAVERY OF POLICE OFFICIALS AND ARREST AT ESIKHAWENI

                            (Minister's Response)

The  MINISTER  OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Madam  Speaker,  there  are  many
instances of the heroism of police officials, that we  read  about  all  the
time. I will only suggest to members of this House to, at some point,  do  a
scan of media reports over a given period of time and see how  many  stories
will indicate the heroism that the hon member was referring to, of how  many
police officials, even at the risk of their own lives, will  make  available
whatever assistance is required.

Indeed now and again there are citations that are brought before me, for  me
to sign - which are commendations that relate to the wonderful work  that  a
number  of  these  officials  within  the  SA  Police  Services  are  indeed
rendering. I am happy  that  the  matter  of  Esikhawini  is  being  raised,
because there are certain things that one would like to go into.

Firstly, what it indicates is the fact that the police are  sincere  in  the
investigations that they do. That is why we were able to make an  arrest  as
quickly as possible, relating to that  horrendous  incident  in  Esikhawini.
But also I want to commend the people from that part of our country who  did
not resort to vigilantism. They went to the police  in  the  first  instance
and worked together with them  to  effect  that  arrest.  I  am  doing  this
because  vigilantism  is  not  at  all  a  response  to  even  some  of  the
frustrations that our people have. They should not  resort  to  vigilantism,
because when they do that, they expose themselves to criminality. It  cannot
be allowed in a state like ours where democracy is the vehicle that  all  of
us have to use to achieve our own interests as individuals  and  as  members
of society. Thank you very much for this.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, on a point  of  order:  The
hon Minister of Safety and Security is in the same justice  cluster  and  he
might not be aware of the  fact  that  the  hon  Leader  of  the  Opposition
addressed the matter which he could very well respond to.

The SPEAKER: Order! I think the Ministers decide which responses  they  wish
to make. You might want to change the rules, but ... [Interjections.]
                              PRISON CONDITIONS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker, I tried to  draw  your
attention because I simply wanted to respond to  one  issue  raised  by  Rev
Meshoe. There is a tendency amongst our own society to  simply  draw  unfair
parallels and comparisons when it comes to the prison system, which, to  me,
amounts to an advocacy for the violation of their basic rights.

There are times when I hear  people  clamour  to  say  that  we  don't  have
houses, but prisoners get accommodation. We don't have food,  but  prisoners
get food. We don't have medicine, but prisoners get it. We don't  have  milk
for our small infants, but those born in prison get it. To  me  that  is  an
advocacy for the violation of the basic rights of those people.  It  is  not
only in our law about awaiting-trial  prisoners,  but  it  is  also  in  the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 11(2), that  says  that  they
are still innocent until they are proven guilty. And, therefore,  they  want
to vote. This is why Cabinet took that position.

                          PETROLEUM PIPELINES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Speaker, hon  members,  I'm  very
pleased to present the key features of this important piece  of  legislation
of our country, as  we  strive  to  become  an  increasingly  efficient  and
diverse energy economy. I am aware that the Bill was  subjected  to  intense
debate  and  discussion  amongst  the  various  stakeholders.  I  take  this
opportunity to thank them for their contribution and I also  want  to  thank
the chairman of the committee, Mr Goniwe, for his leadership.

I am, indeed, very pleased that we have  reached  this  important  milestone
where, today, we are passing a Bill and ushering  in  a  new  era  in  South
Africa's energy economy. Through this Bill, we pave the way for an  improved
gas  industry  in  South  Africa  regarding,  in  particular,  the  pipeline
infrastructure. We also take forward our signed  agreements  with  our  SADC
partners - the governments of Mozambique and Namibia.

 The rationale for this Bill is to ensure that we address  challenges  ahead
in our pipeline infrastructure.  The  infrastructure  has  been  exceedingly
important in meeting the growing demand  for  liquid  fuels  and  supporting
industrial development in the economic  heartland  since  the  1960s.  Thus,
today, pipeline transport continues to play an important role in  the  South
African economy. A wide range of fuel products are transported through  some
3 000 km of pipeline which crisscrosses parts of South Africa.

We  are  also  mindful  of  future  expansion  requirements   and   capacity
constraints, as well as the fact that pipelines and storage facilities  have
to be strategic and be  taken  care  of  in  our  economy.  As  the  economy
develops, we will run out of this capacity. There will be  a  need  to  roll
out  new  pipelines  or  embark  on  projects  in  order  to   de-bottleneck
congestions. It is important  that  Government  should  create  an  enabling
environment and encourage this development.

A network of pipelines is used for  transporting  crude  oil  and  petroleum
products between the port of Durban and refineries; the crude and  synthetic
fuel  refineries  in  Gauteng  and  Mpumalanga;  and  between  depots.   The
petroleum industry and markets are highly dependent  on  this  network.  The
pipeline network is, thus, of strategic importance and  the  fact  that  the
economy depends on a stable supply of liquid fuels, effective  operation  of
petroleum pipelines and storage infrastructure.

To date, the state has  managed  the  operation  of  much  of  the  pipeline
network. With this Bill, it is now going  to  become  possible  for  parties
other than the national Government, to become active in  the  ownership  and
operation of petroleum pipelines. This Bill takes  the  process  of  managed
liberalisation  further.  It  is,  therefore,  incumbent  on  Government  to
introduce regulatory measures to  ensure  the  efficient  operation  of  the
pipeline network and the orderly development of future networks.  All  these
changes must keep energy affordable, especially for the development  of  the
industrial heartland and the whole of South Africa.

The changes introduced in this Bill include: increased  competition  between
and  within  energy  carriers;  protection  of   the   country's   strategic
interests; measures aimed at developing appropriate rules of  the  game  for
investors; facilitation of investment projects; and  regulating  only  where
it is necessary.

The overarching objectives  of  this  Bill  are:  to  establish  a  national
regulatory framework for  petroleum  pipelines;  to  establish  a  petroleum
pipelines regulatory authority as the custodian or enforcer of the  national
regulatory framework; and to provide for matters connected therewith.

The impartial pipelines regulator must make decisions  that  are  consistent
with the Constitution and this Bill, and are in  the  public  interest.  The
regulator, as the licensing body, will ensure that no  person  will  operate
without  a  licence  issued  by  the  appropriate  authority;  construct   a
petroleum pipeline, loading facility, or storage facility  -  or  operate  a
petroleum pipeline, loading or  storage  facility  -  without  due  process.
Safety considerations, environmental impacts  and  economic  rationale  will
contribute to the decisions that will be reached by the regulator.

Included amongst the key outcomes of this Bill  are:  the  establishment  of
the pipeline regulator; the undoing of preferential tariffs between  refined
and crude products thus undoing a 40-year  legacy;  licences  that  will  be
issued for a period of 25 years at a  time  to  ensure  that  investors  can
recoup their large investments; and crude  oil  supply  mechanisms  for  the
inland refinery and other benefits.

I also want to mention that, with  this  regulation,  empowerment  companies
and other new entrants will have fair access to  the  pipeline  and  storage
facilities that belong to the established company. We have seen that in  the
case of Richards Bay Coal Terminal where  the  port  terminal  is  privately
owned and empowerment parties have struggled to have access. In  this  case,
we have made sure that this does not happen.

Even as I speak we are engaged, in my department, with the different  stages
of phasing in the gas infrastructure. The first phase  includes  an  865  km
pipeline which is being built at a cost  of  US$549  million  and  will  run
between Mozambique and Secunda. The second phase will  include  options  for
the Western Cape. Those options will be an onshore pipeline  from  Kudu,  in
Namibia; an offshore pipeline which will run  from  Ibhubesi,  on  the  West
Coast, to Saldanha and will continue to  Cape  Town,  and  eventually  reach
Mossel Bay, Port Elizabeth and Coega. The third phase  will  be  a  pipeline
from the West Coast to Gauteng, via Sishen; and the  fourth  phase  will  be
Port Elizabeth via East London.

 All along these pipelines there will be opportunities for small  businesses
to benefit as the pipelines would also have tributaries which will  be  able
to provide gas for smaller businesses. [Applause.] I ask you  to  pass  this
Bill that creates a strong gas industry in South Africa and  a  better  life
for all. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Thank you very much,  Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members.  The
chaotic regulatory framework pertaining  to  the  pipeline  network  of  our
country is but one typical example of the legacy and bad governance  of  the
past dispensation. The poor regulation  and  management  of  this  strategic
asset resulted in a chaotic spontaneity which  was  informed  by  unfettered
greed that sought to exclude  large  sections  of  our  community  from  the
construction, management and operation of this key  strategic  resource  and
asset whose vital role in the economy cannot be overemphasised.

The Bill in front of the House  today  is  a  further  indication  that  our
department and Government are equal to the task of dealing head-on with  the
distortions of the past by creating a regulatory framework which  ushers  in
transparency, accountability, equity, equality and predictability. Gone  are
the  days  for  exclusive  cloak-and-dagger  dealings   which   gave   scant
recognition to  the  imperatives  of  prudent  economic  practices  and  the
aspirations of the poor communities who were relegated to lives  of  misery,
deprivation and want.

Consistent with the transformatory vision of the  ANC-led  Government,  this
piece of legislation, inter  alia  ,  seeks  to  promote  companies  in  the
petroleum pipelines industry that are owned  by  historically  disadvantaged
South Africans  by  means  of  licensing  conditions.  Consistent  with  our
commitment to good, transparent and accountable governance, the Bill  before
the House seeks to promote competition in the construction and operation  of
the petroleum  pipelines  loading  facilities  and  storage  facilities.  It
further seeks to promote the efficient, effective, sustainable  and  orderly
development and use of petroleum pipelines loading  facilities  and  storage
facilities.

These key objectives of the Bill give a concrete meaning to  our  desire  to
facilitate entry by the  historically  disadvantaged  in  the  upstream  and
thereby giving practical meaning to the ideas of the petroleum  charter  and
broad-based black economic empowerment imperatives.  This  Bill  is  also  a
fitting response to the cries of those  millions  of  our  people  who  have
placed their trust in the ANC to deliver them from the shackles of  poverty,
hunger, deprivation and want.

Allow me, therefore, to acknowledge the  useful  contributions  we  received
during the public hearings  from  all  key  stakeholders  in  the  industry,
community-based organisations and individuals.  These  inputs  have  ensured
that we produced a balanced piece of legislation which  levels  the  playing
field.

I would be failing in my duty if I did not congratulate the  department  and
the Minister on painstaking work in pioneering this legislation  and  taking
on board concerns of the stakeholders emanating from  the  public  hearings.
We must thank you, Minister Mlambo-Ngcuka, for  your  steadfast  leadership,
vision and commitment to the creation of a  world-class  petroleum  industry
whose prime beneficiaries must become all South Africans.

The ANC supports this Bill without reservations. It is equally important  to
acknowledge the spirit of goodwill and co-operation that exists between  the
industry and the department and the Ministry. It is this  kind  of  goodwill
and co-operation which has enabled the minerals and energy  sector  to  play
such a pivotal and pioneering role in the transformation  process.  I  thank
you very much, Madam Speaker.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Madam Speaker, much has been written about  the  political,
social and economic costs of the apartheid government. One of  the  economic
costs little written about but largely felt is the highly complex  structure
of the liquid  fuels  industry  in  this  country,  a  structure  marked  by
monopolies or near monopolies, collusive practices as well  as  heavy-handed
government regulation.

All this has resulted in an artificially inflated price to the  consumer  at
the pump, a price which we know is already too high. The DA has long  argued
that it is not only the rand/dollar exchange rate and the dollar price of  a
barrel of oil that has affected  consumers;  it  is  the  structure  of  the
industry which needs to be addressed at all levels of the value chain.

We recognise though that  this  cannot  be  done  overnight.  As  said,  the
industry is huge, complex, anticompetitive and structurally embedded in  its
nature. I am pleased to say that this Bill begins the process of  a  managed
liberalisation of the industry.

One of  the  structural  problems  has  been  the  monopolistic  control  by
Petronet of the pipeline network from Durban into the industrial  heartland.
A further problem, and I hope I'm not being too  simplistic,  has  been  the
protection by the state of Natref's hegemony over the  industrial  heartland
by subsidised pipeline tariff structures  and  the  restricted  use  of  the
pipelines for the distribution of refined products. To  put  it  simply,  it
was difficult for coastal refiners to get their product into the  hinterland
effectively and at competitive prices.

The Bill goes some way towards  undoing  these  restrictive  anticompetitive
practices. To me, the core  achievements  of  the  Bill  are:  Firstly,  the
regulation and control  of  the  tariffs  that  the  pipeline  operator  can
charge. As said earlier,  the  pipeline  controller  is  a  monopoly,  often
blamed for charging excessive tariffs. Ideally, monopolies should be  broken
up and privatised, and if they can't be, their pricing structures should  be
regulated. This is what the Bill seeks to do.

Secondly, it releases the pipeline from  effective  contractual  control  by
the national refinery while ensuring that Natref gets  sufficient  feedstock
to ensure its viability. Importantly, what it allows is  greater  access  to
the pipeline by the coastal refiners at  competitive  tariffs.  Thirdly,  by
allowing multiproduct use of two of the pipelines,  the  pipelines  will  be
utilised at optimum capacity.

In short, what this Bill will achieve is to allow coastal  refiners  greater
penetration into South Africa's industrial heartland. The  result  of  these
reforms has to be greater competition with resultant positive spin-offs  for
the consumer at the pump. We support the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Madam Speaker, it's a feature  of  South  Africa's  historical
development  that  our  country's  economic  heartland  lies  thousands   of
kilometres away from our main deep-water ports at the  coast.  The  economic
heartland,  essentially  the  province  of   Gauteng   and   its   immediate
surroundings,  depends  to  a  very  large  degree  on  different  modes  of
transport to bring commodities and other production inputs to its doorstep.

These modes of transport include various ones such as rail  and  roads,  but
also include pipelines that bring crude oil and refined  petroleum  products
to inland refineries and other  industries  and  consumers  that  depend  on
these  energy  sources  for  production  and  consumption.  Pipelines   are,
therefore, of national strategic importance.

It came as something of a surprise to many of us  in  this  House  that  the
operation of pipelines has never been regulated in this country. Of  course,
when one learns that the  existing  pipelines  have  either  been  owned  or
controlled  by  the  state,  the  absence  of   regulations   becomes   more
understandable.

However, as is the case with all aspects of life in the  new  South  Africa,
the situation has changed and it is now possible for  companies  other  than
the national Government to own and operate petroleum pipelines. A system  of
regulating  these  pipelines  is,  therefore,  needed  to  ensure  efficient
operation of the  pipeline  network  and  the  orderly  development  of  the
network in future.

The  Bill  before  us,  therefore,  establishes   the   Petroleum   Pipeline
Regulatory Authority, which will deal with the necessary regulation  of  the
pipeline industry and the licensing  system  for  owners  and  operators  of
pipelines. The IFP welcomes its establishment, but we want to highlight  two
very important matters relating to the regulator. Firstly, it is  imperative
that the regulator's  staff  is  sufficiently  qualified  to  execute  their
duties in a skilled, fair and reasonable manner.  If  such  skills  are  not
currently available, it is crucial that  intensive  training  programmes  be
launched to equip staff with the necessary skills.

Secondly, the Cabinet  has  already  decided  that  the  various  regulatory
bodies in the overall energy sector would  shortly  be  amalgamated  into  a
single national energy  regulator,  which  will  evolve  from  the  existing
national  electricity   regulatory   structure.   The   IFP   welcomes   the
establishment of such a single regulator for the  energy  industry,  but  we
would recommend that the process be speeded up as much as possible  so  that
the unnecessary wastage of resources does not occur.

It would be an understatement to say that certain parties with large  vested
interests extensively  lobbied  Parliament  on  this  Bill.  Some  of  these
interests have their origins in the history of sanctions-busting efforts  by
successive  apartheid  governments,  yet  their  continued   existence   and
strategic importance to the national economy meant that we, as  legislators,
had to be sure that our decisions  would  not  endanger  important  national
economic assets and their future contribution to our industrial  development
and growth.

During the deliberations on the Bill, it became evident  that  environmental
and safety issues connected to  petroleum  pipelines,  in  particular  their
physical proximity to some of our communities, were not the  real  focus  of
the Bill and were covered by other  legislation  such  as  the  Occupational
Health and Safety Act and the  National  Environmental  Management  Act.  We
want to stress  that  because  these  Acts  are  administered  by  different
departments, a special responsibility rests on Parliament and the  petroleum
pipelines regulator to ensure that a co-ordinated approach to  environmental
and safety issues is followed. It is only in this manner that the safety  of
communities in close proximity to pipelines could be assured.

The IFP will support the Petroleum Pipelines Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Speaker, the  petroleum  and  pipelines  industry  is,
indeed, as Cosatu puts it:


  The lifeblood of the  economy,  whose  secure  supply  through  strategic
  arteries of the pipeline network ... must be maintained.

In fact, they contradict themselves later but, I  think,  that  introduction
is good enough.

Pipelines are by their very nature potential natural monopolies  across  the
globe, whether privately owned, state-owned or parastatally owned.  However,
the regulation of pipelines is also an international norm.  Maybe  I  should
quote - I think it's applicable  here  -  what  the  Minister  said  in  the
magazine called Acumen:


  It  is  a  satisfactory   compromise   between   Government's   political
  imperatives and the commercial realities of the industry.
History has shown us - I agree with the Minister - that  the  South  African
government of the past and  to  a  lesser  extent  presently,  has,  through
parastatals, played a  major  role  in  the  petroleum  and  related  energy
industries with billions of rands in loans  and  subsidies.  Sasol,  Natref,
Petronet, Portnet and Transnet were the main  beneficiaries,  and  also  the
powerhouses of stable supply.

Studies,  however,  have  also  shown  that  the   current   pipelines   and
infrastructure have reached their sell-by date, as many pipelines were  laid
and infrastructure established in the sixties. Hence,  there  is  an  urgent
need to invest, revamp and expand. A group called Groundwork - some type  of
environmental consciousness agitation group - has reported  leakages,  on  7
July, of about 950 million litres of petrol in Durban South, bitumen  leaks,
marine fuel pipeline leaks and freight failure in the same  year.  Then,  we
have this incident in Tongaat of a gas pipeline exploding next to a  school.
But, at the same time, I've seen in the newspaper clipping that I have  here
that:
  Transnet plans to spend R3 billion renewing the  Durban  to  Johannesburg
  underground pipeline as part of the R12 billion to be  spent  on  capital
  expenditure in the year ahead.

I think the  intention  is  noble  and  I  also  think  it  is  possibly  an
acknowledgement of the advanced stage of the decrepitude that our  pipelines
have reached and that we really need new ones. Even the Petronet  study  has
shown that a section of the  Durban  to  Johannesburg  pipeline  would  face
capacity problems by between 2005 and 2010. However, free market  proponents
says this would not have happened if private  investment  in  new  pipelines
were allowed.

I  wanted  to  get  into  the  ethos  of  Cosatu's  critique  of   ``managed
liberalisation'' but I don't think I have enough time for that.  But  that's
neither here nor there. Our country cannot  afford  any  disruption  in  our
supply line. The intention of the Petroleum Pipelines  Bill  is,  therefore,
to strike a balanced approach that allows new entrants, albeit  in  strictly
controlled conditions, whilst not offending the delicate  sensibilities  and
interests of the already established parastatals of good  standing.  It  is,
therefore, my brief to support the Bill on behalf of the New NP.

Mr S K LOUW: Speaker, I want to thank the Minister and  the  department  for
proposing this historical legislation to be voted on by this House.

The ANC supports this Bill before the House, not  because  the  Minister  is
from the ANC, but because this Bill has materialised through  a  wide  range
of consultation. We had workshops, briefings by  the  department,  oversight
visits to the communities where  pipelines  are  situated,  and  interaction
with many other stakeholders.  Contrary  to  what  others  might  say,  this
Petroleum Pipelines Bill is in the economic interest  of  the  country,  and
not in the interest of one or other vested interest.

What the Petroleum Pipelines Bill sets out to achieve makes  economic  sense
from the perspective that it encourages free and  fair  competition  amongst
the oil industry players as well as  ensuring  that  the  inland  market  is
constantly supplied with petroleum products. The Bill is  another  milestone
towards breaking down  apartheid  barriers  and  thereby  encouraging  those
former apartheid supporters/businesses in the oil  industries  to  stand  on
their own feet and function in a competitive environment.

The Bill eliminates market manipulation through the  old  regulatory  system
for the efficient functioning of  the  state  oil  pipeline  infrastructure.
This Bill also proposes the creation of the Petroleum  Pipelines  Regulatory
Authority.  The  regulator  would  have  the  powers,   through   licensing,
monitoring and intervention, to break  down  what  was  called  the  Gordian
knot.

I can see that all the opposition parties  are  surprised  to  hear  of  the
concept of the Gordian knot and its relationship to the Petroleum  Pipelines
Bill and also the need  for  the  pipelines  to  be  regulated  through  the
pipeline authority. The fact that they do not understand the  concept  of  a
Gordian knot and the necessity to cut the knot serves  as  a  rationale  for
the opposition to be averse to the Petroleum Pipelines  Bill.  It  has  also
become clear that anything the ANC proposes,  they  oppose,  notwithstanding
the economic soundness of the proposal. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: We are not opposing it. You are reading the wrong speech.

Mr  S  K  LOUW:  Let  me  focus  on  the  Gordian  knot  in   the   pipeline
infrastructure that  was  created  by  the  reconfiguration  of  the  inland
pipeline system.  [Interjections.]  The  refined  product  pipeline  between
Durban and Newcastle was changed to a crude  oil  pipeline  at  Ingogo.  The
refined product line from Ingogo to Secunda was changed to a  gas  pipeline,
and the crude oil pipeline between Durban and Ingogo was changed  to  a  gas
pipeline. This gas pipeline became known as the Lily Gas Pipeline. This  was
also one of the last Acts passed in 1995, which was introduced by  the  then
Minister of Minerals  and  Energy,  Pik  Botha,  during  the  Government  of
National Unity, to reward those who supported apartheid  with  their  hearts
and souls.
What has been the result of this reconfiguration? It has created  a  refined
product stronghold on the inland market by shutting out  additional  refined
products from  the  Durban  Refiners.  In  order  to  create  the  Lily  Gas
Pipeline, Petronet spent R50 million to reconfigure the  product  and  crude
pipeline to a gas pipeline which had an income-generation  of  R166  million
or R60 million per year. Now, to replace that lost refined product  capacity
that will shortly become a reality  in  the  inland  market,  it  will  cost
Petronet approximately R1,5 billion to build an additional product  pipeline
capacity.

Minister, I have stated earlier that it  is  obvious  that  Petronet  cannot
privatise as it is a natural monopoly. Moreover, it  is  important  for  the
Natref neutralities principle to be  restored  between  coastal  and  inland
refineries. It is also obvious that Petronet  in  its  current  form  cannot
merely be transferred to  the  CEF  group  as  it  is  imperative  that  the
petroleum pipelines company,  Petronet,  is  structured  into  an  efficient
commercial petroleum logistic company.
In adopting this Bill, the committee reaffirms its role in  contributing  in
a meaningful way to the transformation of the minerals and energy sector  in
a manner that promotes  equitable  redistribution  of  resources,  redresses
past injustices and imbalances in  ownership  and  management,  and  ensures
that these sectors serve the needs of all South Africa as  a  whole  to  the
fullest extent possible. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Voorsitter, ek wonder of ons die agb Louw miskien nog  'n  paar
minute tyd kan gee, dat hy net vir ons hierdie knoop van hom  wil  ontknoop,
want ek het nog nie een party gehoor wat  hierdie  stuk  wetgewing  opponeer
nie. Ek verstaan nie sy argument heeltemal nie.

Met die toetrede van meer instansies tot  die  ontwikkeling  van  logistieke
infrastruktuur vir die hantering van petroleumprodukte en om gelyke  toegang
tot  die  infrastruktuur  te  verseker,  is  'n  raamwerk  vir  deregulering
noodsaaklik. Dit is die oogmerke van die wetsontwerp, spesifiek  klousule  2
en gevolglik ondersteun die ACDP dit.
Daar is egter definisies en terminologie in die wetsontwerp wat vaag  is  en
tot  misverstande  kan  lei.  Die  terme  ``objectively  justifiable''   and
``identifiable'' soos in klousule 21 gebruik, word as 'n  voorbeeld  genoem.
Dié beskrywings is  subjektief  en  relatief  en  kan  moeilik  al  dan  nie
diskriminasie omskryf.

Tariefbepalings,  soos  in  die  wetsontwerp  aanbeveel,   word   deur   die
reguleringsliggaam in klousule 28 voorgeskryf om te verhoed dat  binnelandse
verwerkingsaanlegte en bergingsfasiliteite  ...  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, I wonder if we could give the hon Louw a few  more
minutes, so that he could unravel this knot of his for us,  because  I  have
not heard a single party say that it opposes this piece  of  legislation.  I
do not fully understand his argument.

With the entry of more  institutions  into  the  development  of  logistical
infrastructure for the handling of petroleum products and  to  ensure  equal
access to the infrastructure, a framework for  deregulations  is  essential.
These  are  the  objectives  of  the  Bill,  specifically  clause   2,   and
consequently the ACDP supports it.

However, there are definitions and terminology in the Bill which  are  vague
and could lead to misunderstandings. The terms  ``objectively  justifiable''
and ``identifiable'', as used in clause 21,  are  examples  of  this.  These
descriptions are subjective and  relative  and  define  discrimination  with
difficulty, if at all.

Tariff provisions, as  recommended  in  the  Bill,  are  prescribed  by  the
regulatory body in clause 28 in order to prevent domestic  processing  plans
and storage facilities ...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr A BLAAS: Ek kan nie dink dit is 'n minuut nie.  [I  cannot  believe  that
that was a minute.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. The  petroleum  pipeline  has  been
solely handled by  Petronet  that  has  owned,  maintained  and  operated  a
network of 3 000 km of high pressure petroleum.  The  MF  strongly  supports
the privatisation of the petroleum pipeline industry that serves to  benefit
our economy.

Noting the importance of liquid fuels and  the  caution  necessary  for  its
management, the MF  strongly  supports  the  Petroleum  Pipelines  Bill,  to
ensure the proper management of the industry  by  the  private  sector.  The
great investment that this may invite is exciting, but it  is  crucial  that
the possible dangers be prevented by proper inculcation and management.

The Petroleum Pipelines Bill appears to harness a beneficial  framework  for
the privatisation of petroleum pipelines. It is hoped that these  provisions
will be strictly adhered to  so  as  to  maintain  the  security  of  proper
management.

The MF supports the Petroleum Pipelines Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter, dit is 'n  aangename  afwisseling  om  met  'n
wetsontwerp te handel wat eintlik deregulering moontlik maak, aangesien  die
brandstof pypleiding voorheen totaal en al deur die staat beheer is.  Daarom
maak hierdie wetsontwerp dit moontlik dat alle rolspelers ook  hierdie  mark
kan betree.

Aan die ander kant is dit so dat brandstof 'n strategiese produk is  en  dat
ons dit nie  maar  net  aan  die  vryemark  kan  oorlaat  nie.  Dit  is  van
strategiese waarde vir Suid-Afrika en so  ook  die  gerieflike  vervoer  van
brandstof na die noodsaaklike punte. Daarom is 'n raamwerk nodig en  is  die
deregulering wat in hierdie wetsontwerp voorgestel word, ook noodsaaklik.

Die Nasionale Aksie glo dat hierdie maatreëls binne perke  is,  dat  dit  'n
billike wetsontwerp is, dat dit daartoe  sal  lei  dat  hierdie  strategiese
middel in Suid-Afrika ten beste aangewend sal word vir  die  doeleindes  van
Suid-Afrika, sy doelwitte en al sy mense.  Die  Nasionale  Aksie  steun  dus
graag hierdie wetsontwerp. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, it makes a  pleasant  change  to  be  dealing
with a Bill which actually  makes  deregulation  possible,  since  the  fuel
pipeline was totally controlled by the state  before.  Therefore  this  Bill
makes it possible for all role-players to enter this market.

On the other hand it is a fact that fuel is a strategic product and that  we
cannot just leave it to the free market. It is of strategic value  to  South
Africa, as is also  convenient  transportation  of  fuel  to  the  necessary
points. For that reason  a  framework  is  necessary  and  the  deregulation
proposed in this Bill is also essential.

The National Action believes that these measures are reasonable,  that  this
is a fair Bill, that it will result in this strategic means in South  Africa
being used to its full potential for  the  purposes  of  South  Africa,  its
goals and all its people. The National Action therefore  wishes  to  support
this Bill.]

Mr B G BELL: Chair, Minister, members of Parliament, it is  my  pleasure  to
speak on the Petroleum Pipelines Bill on behalf of the DA.

The purpose of this  legislation  is  to  establish  a  national  regulatory
framework for petroleum pipelines, and  further  to  establish  a  Petroleum
Pipelines Regulatory Authority to regulate the administration  of  pipelines
and storage facilities.

Currently,  we  have  three  pipelines  from  the  Kwazulu-Natal  coast   to
Gauteng/Mpumalanga transporting gas, crude oil  and  refined  products  from
the coast  to  inland  areas.  These  are  all  owned  and  administered  by
Petronet, a state-owned public enterprise under the Transnet umbrella.  This
has resulted in a monopoly situation and this Bill  endeavours  to  open  up
the use of the pipelines. The establishment of this  authority  to  regulate
the pipelines will improve the situation and, in turn, when a single  energy
regulator is established, the whole industry will be better managed.

The Minister must appoint the five members to the authority. This gives  the
Minister power to regulate the  use  of  the  pipelines.  As  the  petroleum
industry is a specialised industry, the appointment of this  authority  will
be very difficult. To meet the requirements in this Bill, the Minister  will
need to  be  very  careful  in  not  allowing  a  conflict  of  interest  to
penetrate.

In future all pipelines will have  to  be  licensed.  The  licence  will  be
issued by the authority under very stringent regulations and will  be  valid
for 25 years, renewable on application.

The DA will support the Bill, and trusts that  the  industry  will  be  more
open and private enterprise activities will be  more  readily  accommodated.
[Interjections.] I thank you.

Mr J H NASH: Speaker, Minister, Deputy Minister, my colleagues  in  the  ANC
and others on the opposition benches, the horizon in the  transformation  of
the oil industry can be seen through the two Bills before the House today.

With regard to the oil industry, you have to understand the  past  in  order
to  understand  the  present  necessity  for  transformation.  Policies  and
legislation must be well informed and researched, and not like  Mr  Davidson
who, before he understands the critical issues, jumps in with  three  boots,
taking a vested interest position and not a national interest position.

My address today reflects on the hidden financial benefits of  apartheid  in
the logistics infrastructure of the oil industry. The DA  must  not  suggest
that they are against apartheid when their  objections  to  clauses  in  the
Bill are aimed at the  retention  of  these  hidden  financial  benefits  of
apartheid.

The apartheid financial benefits are hidden in  the  tariff  structures  and
the agreements that the former regime foisted on Petronet.  Furthermore,  it
is not a financial benefit that is earned through investment but given  free
of charge. Who gets it? It is not for whom  the  bell  tolls,  that  is  the
consumer,  but  for  those  who  propped  up  the  regulatory  framework  of
apartheid.

To what extent has the consumer been taken to the cleaners, or  income  been
lost by Petronet? This  would  have  to  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  a
fundamental fair play  principle.  You  reap  what  you  sow,  a  reasonable
profit, not more not less. Furthermore, numbers do  not  lie,  Mr  Davidson,
and this is why the proposed tariff-setting mechanism is fundamental in  the
Petroleum Pipelines Bill.

It was agreed in 1967 between SA Transport  Services  and  Natref  that  the
crude pipeline tariff would be set at the ratio of the Natref white  product
yield. For the past seven years this has not been implemented.  The  average
tariff ratio was 62%, while the Natref white product yield ratio was  80%  -
an advantage of 18%.  This  advantage  translates  into  unearned  financial
benefits. Was this an oversight, or was this a deliberate act of  extracting
superprofits from the system?

It is now clear to us that between  1996  and  2003,  a  seven-year  period,
Natref  overrecovered  on  the  pipeline  by   R438 million;   the   coastal
refineries Sapref and Enref overrecovered by R204 million;  Sasol  Synthetic
Fuels overrecovered by R2,305 billion; and a  total  of  R2,947 billion  was
accumulated by Sasol - this, over and above their subsidy,  courtesy  of  an
unsuspecting consumer and the Department of Minerals and Energy.

The pipeline tariff charges to transport refined product are lower than  the
zone differential in the price of  the  product  charged  to  the  consumer.
Moreover, Sasol claims the transport element for synfuels that it  does  not
incur.

Discounting the fact that overrecovery is  compensating  for  infrastructure
and storage, the oil companies already charge through  the  MPAR  mechanism.
However, herein lies another discrepancy. Natref  overrecovered  R17,76  per
1 000 litres, while the coastal refineries overrecovered  R10,75  per  1 000
litres. This resulted in a difference of R7,01 per  1 000  litres.  Natref's
pipeline  throughput  was  24,699  million  litres.  Sasol  Synthetic  Fuels
overrecovered by R83,65 per 1 000 litres. This, over the past  seven  years.
[Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Do you know what you're talking about?

Mr  J  H  NASH:  There  are  no  costs  associated  with   obtaining   these
superprofits. This is what I am talking about - these superprofits - if  you
had listened. If  this  tariff  structure  was  geared  towards  encouraging
refineries in supplying the inland market, surely all  players  should  have
received R10,75 per 1 000 litres as is the case for coastal refineries,  and
not R17,76 or R83,65  per  1 000  litres  as  was  received  by  the  inland
refineries? This is how the apartheid  regime  propped  up  their  favourite
sons.

The concept of  Natref  in  Durban  has  nothing  to  do  with  being  at  a
disadvantage to the Durban refineries.  Rather,  this  is  about  protecting
superprofits to the exclusion of all others in the lucrative inland  market.
We must get this right in our thoughts. [Interjections.] If there  was  real
neutrality between the Durban and the inland refineries  and  no  refineries
received extra money, the inland price could have been  lowered  by  4c  per
litre.

An HON MEMBER: Why not?

Mr J H NASH: Upon the passing of this Bill - you didn't listen  as  usual  -
these matters will require the immediate investigation of the  Minister.  Mr
Davidson, now you and your whole party know why the ANC supports  the  Bill,
and particularly the tariff-setting mechanism for  the  Petroleum  Pipelines
Regulatory Authority. You don't have to be a rocket  scientist  to  come  to
these conclusions. [Interjections.] It is high time  that  Mr  Davidson  and
the DA acknowledge that they  need  to  start  taking  lessons  on  the  oil
industry from the ANC.
The next thing that we really want to get down to is this  overrecovery  and
underrecovery story which we have to suffer from every month  as  consumers.
It is about time that we discussed this so that there does not  need  to  be
an overrecovery and underrecovery. As usual,  of  course,  my  good  friends
here from the DA don't understand these things and so they have  to  make  a
noise all the time. Sometimes I feel sorry for these poor chaps. We need  to
stop addressing them from the podium and take these people  for  lessons  so
that they will know what the oil  industry  is  about  and  stop  supporting
vested interests and look at the national position. [Interjections.]

 The national position is that we must look at the  interests  of  everybody
concerned, particularly the motorist. Why is the motorist  paying  4c  more?
Why? [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Tell us why.

Mr J H NASH: You must follow what I've just said. You're asking why  because
you didn't listen to what I was saying.  Next  time  see  that  you  listen.
Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Hon Chairperson, Oom Nash is  always  a
hard act to follow. I would like to thank all the members  and  the  parties
for supporting this  Bill.  Mr  Davidson,  thank  you  very  much  for  also
supporting, interestingly, empowerment, cleaning up  the  industry  and  its
intricacies.

I want to assure Mr Lucas that the issue of energy regulators  is  uppermost
in our minds. We are working on it. We may need help from the  committee  as
we are a bit late in terms of the required timeframes  for  Parliament,  but
this is critical because gas is going to be coming in 2004, so  we  do  need
to have that in place. Regarding the issue of leakages underground that  was
raised by the member from the New NP, I also want to  assure  him  that  the
new regulator will also be seized with that matter.

I do want to thank the committee for the amount of work  they  have  done  -
the visits they undertook, their interaction with communities  and  the  big
stakeholders, as well as the general research they did  in  preparation  for
this Bill, which was very impressive. Mr Aucamp, I also want  to  thank  you
for highlighting the strengths of the Bill, in particular  for  highlighting
the strategic nature of the pipelines infrastructure.

I also want to inform members that there is going to be  extensive  training
for the members of the new regulators. The training  that  we  have  planned
for them includes training here in South Africa and in  different  parts  of
the world where we will be able to  get  exposure  to  top  and  world-class
regulators in this sector.

As a result of passing this Bill, hon members, you must now  know  that  you
have just ushered in an era in which we are introducing  cleaner  energy  to
the South African economy; we are diversifying our  sources  of  energy;  we
are creating greater security of supply; and, of course, we  are  making  an
industry that is more open but, at the same time,  managed  in  a  strategic
way in the sense that Government continues to play a  role  and  to  provide
stewardship. So, as I said, after Uncle Nash what is  there  to  say?  Thank
you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                      PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Hon  Chair  ...  ANC  e  a  sebeletswa.
Namhlanje ngitholakele [... one works hard for the ANC. Today they got me.]

Chair, hon members, this Bill, the Petroleum  Products  Amendment  Bill  has
been the subject of intense debate and discussion. It is  rather  a  complex
piece of legislation and amending it was also quite complex. Again,  I  want
to thank the members, because they did a sterling job.

Through this amendment we are introducing and ushering in a new era  in  the
energy industry, especially the petroleum industry. This Bill  provides  for
licensing of persons involved in  the  manufacture  and  sale  of  petroleum
products; it prohibits certain actions relating to petroleum products,  such
as self-service, so that we do not lose jobs - we still  have  the  man  and
woman at the pump, vertical  integration  and  people  operating  without  a
licence; it amends and substitutes or repeals  obsolete  provisions  of  the
Act; it also provides for appeal and arbitration; it seeks to modernise  the
Act and to bring it in line with the  current  sociopolitical  and  economic
priorities of the South African liquid fuels industry  and  the  economy  at
large.

The previous government entered into a number of  secret  arrangements  with
the industry, which today cannot be  ignored  as  we  embark  on  a  managed
liberalisation programme. One of the strategic  contexts  that  we  need  to
note  is  the  fact  that  procurement  of  petroleum  products  remains  an
important item in South Africa's balance of payments,  as  crude  oil  still
remains the single largest  item  in  South  Africa's  balance  of  payments
account. The synthetic fuel programme and its importance in the  context  of
the balance of payments and its environmental impact had to  be  taken  into
consideration in developing an appropriate regulatory framework because  the
country still derives a lot of benefits from synfuels.

The transformation of the liquid fuels industry, like all other  sectors  of
the economy, is fundamental. This sector has been a pioneer in the  area  of
transformation, as you know. The first empowerment  charter  was  signed  in
this sector. Nevertheless, that charter  was  not  regulated.  Through  this
Bill we are regulating the  liquid  fuels  charter.  The  industry  is  also
currently structured in a manner that squeezes out the  small  players,  and
therefore that gives rise to one-sided contracts. Through this Bill  we  are
also improving that environment.

The liquid fuels industry is on the verge of making  significant  investment
to render their products more environmentally friendly. It  therefore  means
that an environment conducive to such investment has to be fostered so  that
investors can feel secure.

One of the changes that we need to note as emanating from this  industry  is
the fact that liberalisation and increased competition in the energy  sector
will be possible.  We  will  remain  internationally  competitive.  We  will
sustain the South African synfuels industry in a liberalised environment.

We will have a stable and continued supply of quality  products  nationwide.
We will maintain an efficient network of  transport  retailing  and  storage
infrastructure. We will also address issues of safety and environment as  we
manage the phasing in of unleaded petrol by 2006. We will also  address  the
fight between  retailers  and  oil  companies  that  we  experience  in  the
industry from time to time.

The overriding objectives  of  this  Bill  include  promoting  an  efficient
manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing  petroleum  industry;  facilitating
an  environment  conducive  to  efficient   and   commercially   justifiable
investment; the creation of employment opportunities and the development  of
small business in the petroleum sector; ensuring  availability  of  products
at a competitive price  countrywide,  and  promoting  access  to  affordable
petroleum products by low-income consumers  and  households.  This  is  very
important because the cost of energy to the poor is exceedingly high.

There are certain issues that one  needs  to  mention  regarding  this  Bill
because they will be impacted in a particular  way.  One  of  them  is,  for
instance, the fact that the Bill requires the industry to  keep  responsible
commercial and strategic stock. In the case of  strategic  stock,  financial
implications to the industry will be considered by the state.

The Bill brings about transformation, as I've indicated, by  regulating  the
charter. It also enables me and  my  department  to  move  people  from  the
intensive use of paraffin to LPG, which will increase  safety  in  the  poor
households where the use of paraffin is still intensive and which  leads  to
many accidents, especially amongst children.

By  prohibiting  self-service  in  petrol  stations  as  well  as   vertical
integration, we will be protecting a lot of jobs. We will also  ensure  that
through this piece of legislation we promote small businesses as there  will
be greater opportunities for retailers, especially  new  entrants,  to  also
get strategic service stations.  As  Government  we  also  play  a  role  in
facilitating the allocation of service stations.

The Bill provides for arbitration. A specific clause has been introduced  in
the  Bill  which  is  aimed  at  addressing  contractual  problems   between
retailers and wholesalers. Because of the imbalance of power, the  two-group
contracts between dealers and their suppliers have tended  to  be  one-sided
and unfair. The Bill provides an avenue for both of these  parties  to  come
to an impartial party to scrutinise these agreements.
There are transitional arrangements in recognition of  the  property  clause
provision in our Constitution. The Bill provides for automatic licensing  of
all the activities that require licensing and that were undertaken prior  to
the promulgation of this Bill, provided that  such  activities  comply  with
the relevant local,  provincial  and  national  regulations  which  were  in
existence before the Bill came into effect.

Madam Speaker, I hope the members appreciate the  complexity  of  this  Bill
and the role that the portfolio committee had to play in order to make  sure
that while they are being even-handed, they are also very decisive.  I  also
want to thank the industry-players for taking a holistic view  and  ensuring
that the different, if not conflicting, demands are also met.

I also want to thank my staff for doing a sterling job in interrogating  all
the aspects of the Bill and for providing the country with a fair,  as  well
as a balanced framework within which the industry will  operate.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]
Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, hon Deputy President and members,  the  Bill  in
front of us today is a collective output of the Department of  Minerals  and
Energy, Parliament and key  industry  stakeholders.  It  serves  as  a  good
example of what is possible if stakeholders put their differences aside  and
try to find a working solution.

This Bill has been transformed considerably from  the  original  formulation
that was  presented  to  the  portfolio  committee  by  the  department.  It
benefited immensely from the interactions of  key  stakeholders  during  the
public hearings.

The Bill replaces the outdated Petroleum Products Act of 1977. It  seeks  to
modernise this Act and bring it in line with the current sociopolitical  and
economic imperatives of the South African  liquid  fuels  industry  and  the
economy at large. Members will agree that we have made advances since  1977.
The Petroleum Charter, for example,  was  not  even  in  the  minds  of  the
legislators of that time. Hence it has become necessary for a Bill  such  as
this to update the shortcomings of 1977 Act.
The Bill further gives effect to  the  empowerment  charter  of  the  liquid
fuels industry. It creates an enabling environment that will  see  companies
achieve all the commitments  they  made  in  November  2000.  Conditions  of
licence, which will be detailed in  the  regulations,  will  be  promulgated
under this amending Bill and will require companies to show  and  own  their
commitments to the charter. This Bill is going to make it possible for  more
black people to own Ultra City-Sized  filling  stations.  It  will  end  the
existing discriminatory arrangement inherited from the past  which  confines
blacks to owning marginal sites with very low turnovers.

This Bill seeks to address the frustration of  hard-working  women  such  as
Mrs Barbara Nonyane from Moletsane in Soweto, who is part of the people  who
are buckling under  the  heavy  yoke  visited  on  people  such  as  her  by
unscrupulous suppliers who serve their own parochial interests. The  inbuilt
arbitration mechanism will enhance the  capacity  to  solve  the  myriad  of
complaints the committee  and  the  department  receives  from  dissatisfied
operators.
The Bill seeks to address the unfavourable business  conditions  imposed  on
unsuspecting enthusiastic  prospective  businesspersons  who,  for  example,
will allow big business, through contractual arrangements, a 30  to  60  day
payment term for a product they procure. On the other hand,  black  economic
empowerment companies, who can  hardly  afford  to  raise  start-up  capital
because banks refuse to give them capital,  have  to  fund  their  purchases
upfront long before they even sell a drop of the product. This  skewed  kind
of dealing will come to an end.

This brings me to the  next  item  I  would  like  to  discuss.  During  the
hearings, we were inundated with calls that we need less state  intervention
and that there is too much ministerial discretion.  This  depends  on  which
side of the spectrum one stands. I am sure that millions of  underprivileged
people pin their hopes on this Government and the Minister to  intervene  on
their behalf. Surely, the ANC cannot sit with folded its arms when  problems
occur in this industry.

The ANC-led Government cannot, clearly, interfere  in  commercial  dealings.
This Bill will enable it to use its influence to  level  the  playing  field
and bring about a  balance  in  the  powers  of  the  players.  The  ANC-led
Government cannot sit back and watch South Africans take  their  hard-earned
pension money and throw it into the  seemingly  bottomless  pit  called  the
petroleum retailing industry. It is in this regard that  we  would  like  to
assure people such as Barbara Nonyane that their cries have been heard.

Lastly, the ANC supports this Bill without reservation. I want to thank  all
members  of  the  portfolio  committee,  from  all  political  parties,  who
sacrificed recess time and processed these Bills. I would like to thank  all
stakeholders for the useful inputs they made during the public hearings.  We
would also like to thank our support staff and  the  departmental  officials
who have helped us engineer this beautiful piece  of  legislation.  We  hope
that the  Minister  continues  her  good  work,  because  transformation  is
unstoppable. Amandla! [Applause.]
Mr I O DAVIDSON: Chairperson, I  referred  earlier  in  the  debate  on  the
Petroleum Pipelines Bill to both the complex and anticompetitive  nature  of
the liquid fuels industry as a result of our past.

The establishment of the synfuels industry in South  Africa,  while  holding
great benefits, was not  without  cost.  The  promotion  and  protection  of
synfuel production by way of subsidies, agreements by  other  oil  companies
to purchase for resale into the South African economy most  of  the  synfuel
production, and the reciprocal agreements by the synfuel  producers  not  to
market the balance of their production into defined parts  of  South  Africa
had the effect  of  distorting  competition  in  the  liquid  fuel  industry
resulting  in  the  creation  of  effective  monopoly   wholesale   supplier
structures throughout South Africa.

The retail side likewise had constraints placed upon it  through  restraints
and product pricing. Resale  price  maintenance  was  enforced  as  well  as
margin controls at wholesale and  retail  levels.  It  is  therefore  ironic
that, despite all these restraints, it was the retail side of  the  industry
where competition flourished the most. Even this scenario  was,  however,  a
distorted scenario as the big oil companies with deep  pockets  aggressively
entered the retail side in order to buy market share.  In  the  process,  it
squeezed  the  small  man  out  of  the  market  and  it  became  hopelessly
overcrowded.

It is estimated that there are roughly 30% to 35% more  petrol  stations  in
South Africa than the market can sustain. As a result,  throughput  of  fuel
in most petrol stations is declining and the small retailer is being  forced
out. Therefore, Government faces continued pressure to up the retail  margin
in order to salvage the industry.

To make matters worse, Sasol has now indicated  its  intention  of  entering
the industry, and the industry has committed itself to  absorbing  new  HDSA
entrants  into  that  market.  The  market  is  therefore  set  to  be  more
overcrowded and even less viable. The Bill attempts to  address  this  while
avoiding what one stakeholder referred to as a bloodbath.
Clearly, the industry has to be restructured in a more fundamental way  than
this Bill envisages. This restructuring has to take place at all  levels  of
the  supply  chain.  We,  however,  recognise  that  this  cannot  be   done
overnight. Free market forces, in the light of all other  constraints,  have
not been able to play the balancing role. On  the  contrary,  all  that  has
occurred is the continuous upward pressure on the retail margin in order  to
prevent greater numbers of small retailers going under with  consequent  job
losses.

The Government has set a course of managed liberalisation of  the  industry.
This we endorse. This Bill seeks, during a  10-year  transition  period,  to
cap the number of service stations at an  industry-viable  number.  It  also
seeks to allow market forces to play  their  role  within  that  environment
and, in the process, downsize the industry  to  economically  viable  levels
while allowing new entrants into the market.

What has to be emphasised is that this 10-year transition period has  to  be
seen as a breathing space for the managed liberalisation process  to  gather
momentum and the industry to be fundamentally  restructured.  The  objective
must be to introduce a fully competitive market at all levels of the  supply
chain.

To achieve this, the Government must address the following: It has to  allow
for the importation  of  refined  products.  It  should  address  the  whole
question of preferment, on the refining side, of synfuel production as  well
as the effective monopolies that have emerged  in  defined  areas  of  South
Africa. There should be further competition  in  the  distribution  process,
and greater freedom in the  ability  to  market  products  as  well  as  the
possibility of discounting, including the  use  of  promotions.  The  resale
price maintenance and margin control at wholesale and retail  levels  should
be done away with.

In seeking to achieve a competitive liquid fuels industry, Government, at  a
macro level, must seek to optimise competing energy sources,  including  the
promotion and  creation  of  an  optimum  capacity  in,  and  infrastructure
around, each stream such that temporary disruptions in the supply from  each
stream can sufficiently be substituted with supplies from another stream.

At the micro level, this should be through structuring and restructuring  of
the liquid fuels distribution infrastructure such  that  captive  dependency
on the present refining, supply and distribution capacity is displaced  with
an optimum range of supply sources. There should be the optimisation of  the
balance between regulation and  application  of  market  principles  at  all
levels of competition within  the  industry  such  that  market  competition
becomes the preferred tool for achieving the desired  level  of  efficiency.
We support this Bill.

Mr E J LUCAS: Mr Chairperson, the Petroleum  Products  Act  of  1977  was  a
product  of  the  apartheid  government   in   an   effort   to   counteract
international oil sanctions against South  Africa.  As  a  result,  the  Act
fostered a highly regulated petroleum industry that was cloaked  in  secrecy
and sanctions-busting subterfuge.

Obviously, the advent of democracy in  1994  and  the  lifting  of  economic
sanctions against our country meant that the 1977 Act could more or less  be
consigned to the scrapheap of history.  In  addition,  the  White  Paper  on
Energy Policy of 1998 set a brand new policy agenda  for  the  local  liquid
fuels  industry  that  was  in  line  with  the  Government's  socioeconomic
political-policy imperatives.

In 1998 the adoption of the White Paper  quickly  led  to  speculation  that
Government would totally deregulate  the  liquid  fuels  industry.  But  the
reality of the situation is that some of the leftovers of the apartheid  era
are so entrenched in our national economy and in the vital strategic  sector
that reregulation was in point of  fact  the  only  realistic  and  workable
option.

The Bill before us today represents  Government's  attempt  at  reregulating
the liquid fuels industry. In doing so,  governance  of  the  industry  will
centre on a licensing system for  refiners,  wholesalers  and  retailers  of
petroleum products. The  licences  will  be  issued  by  the  Controller  of
Petroleum Products,  who  will  have  to  keep  in  mind  a  number  of  the
objectives that have been written into the Bill.

The objectives include: promoting an efficient comparative retail  petroleum
industry; facilitating an environment conducive to commercially  justifiable
investment; promoting the advancement of  historically  disadvantaged  South
Africans; creating employment opportunities and  the  development  of  small
business;  and,  very  importantly,  ensuring  countrywide  availability  of
petroleum products at competitive prices.

The  third  of  these  objectives,  namely  promoting  the  advancement   of
historically  disadvantaged  South  Africans,  naturally  has  the  greatest
importance for the industry and for black economic empowerment.  Some  years
ago the Government and the oil industry entered into an empowerment  charter
for the liquid fuel sector. Implementation of the charter is  well  underway
at the ownership and equity level, but the barriers for black  companies  to
enter the heavily over-traded fuel sector remain largely  in  place  and  of
grave concern to the IFP.

We welcome the fact that the charter has now been written into the  Bill  by
way of a schedule, but we believe that it could have gone further in  making
access to the retail sector easier and cheaper for new black entrepreneurs.

While it is understandable that the  Government  will  not  want  to  become
overly  involved  in  contractual  relationships   between   retailers   and
wholesalers, and keeping in mind the property right guarantees enshrined  in
our Constitution, we still believe that a method could have  been  found  to
make life easier for new entrants.

The Bill provides  for  a  large  measure  of  discretionary  power  to  the
Minister to make regulations  over  a  wide  variety  of  issues,  including
prohibiting business practices that would negate the objective of  advancing
historically disadvantaged South Africans.
In addition, the Bill provides for the arbitration mechanism that  has  been
significantly straightened by Parliament to  ensure  that  unreasonable  and
unfair  business  practices  between  wholesalers  and  retailers  will   be
resolved in a final, binding manner. We can only hope that these  provisions
will protect and advance the  interests  of  newly  established  black  fuel
retailers.

Finally, Mr Chairperson, the IFP welcomes the fact that the  Bill  continues
the existing ban on self service at fuel retail sites.  In  light  of  South
Africa's very high unemployment rate and sometimes  unintended  consequences
of well-meaning legislation that destroys jobs, this ban  will  continue  to
preserve between 45 000 and 60 000 jobs, not to mention the  livelihoods  of
hundreds and thousands of dependants. The IFP  will  support  the  Petroleum
Products Amendment Bill.

Mrs B TINTO: Mr Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Minister and hon members,  the
Petroleum Products Amendment Bill seeks to bring the petroleum  industry  in
line with the socioeconomic  developments  that  have  taken  place  in  the
country. [Interjections.] Keep  quiet!  It  aims  at,  among  other  things,
fostering  the  entry  of  small  firms,  protecting  the  jobs  of   petrol
attendants  and  ensuring  the  availability  of   petroleum   products   at
competitive prices.

The objective of the Bill is to provide for licensing of  manufacturers  and
for selling of petroleum products to promote transformation  of  the  liquid
fuels industry through the advancement of historically  disadvantaged  South
Africans, black people in particular.

Section 2(b) of the Bill prohibits self service at retail  outlets,  thereby
helping to protect the attendants' jobs. These people need to  be  protected
as their lives are sometimes at stake. Some garages are open 24 hours a  day
and these men and women face dangers  by  working  day  and  night.  If  the
Government introduces self-service at service  stations  siya  kuba  sandisa
intswelo-misebenzi [we will be adding to the unemployment].

Mr M T GONIWE: Kunjalo. [That is true.]

Mrs B TINTO: At present the retail market is already saturated. The  issuing
of licences must  promote  the  advancement  of  historically  disadvantaged
South Africans and the development of small businesses.

Iigaraji zabantu abamnyama zisoloko zincinci, zisondelelene. Loo  nto  yenza
ukuba kungabikho  nzuzo.  Kambe  nabo  abantu  abamnyama  mabasincede  ngoba
kwiigaraji zabo asifumani nkonzo intle. Sifuna ukuba abantu  abamnyama  babe
ngabanini beegaraji ezibizwa  ngelokuba  zii`Ultra  City'kwakunye  neegaraji
ezinkulu, nabo mabazame ukuba abasebenzi babaphathe ngendlela. [Uwelewele.]

Abanye abantu abaneegaraji kwiilokishi zethu  baqesha  yonke  le  mihla.  Xa
ufika kule garaji ubacele  aba  bantu  ukuba  bakugalelele  amanzi  emotweni
okanye baqwalasele umlinganiselo weoli, abakwazi, ngenxa yokuba  abalufumani
uqeqesho. Ngoko, noxa uRhulumente ebanceda abantu  abamnyama,  ebaphakamisa,
nabo  mabazi  ukuba  banoxanduva  abanalo.  Mabangajongi   inzuzo   kuphela.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Petrol stations  run  by  black  people  are  always  small  and  in  close
proximity to one another. That reduces the chance of making a profit.  Black
people should also give proper service to their customers. We would like  to
see black people owning retail outlets like Ultra City or  just  big  petrol
stations, but they must also try to render a good service and  treat  people
in a hospitable manner. [Interjections.]

Some people who have retail outlets in our communities or in  the  townships
employ new staff every day. When you get to a  petrol  station  and  request
that water and oil be checked, you  will  find  that  the  people  that  are
supposed to serve you do not know how to do that because  they  do  not  get
the necessary training. The Government may be doing all they can  to  uplift
and empower black people, but they should know that they themselves  have  a
responsibility. They should not only look at making a profit.]
This Bill seeks to extend the Minister's  power  to  make  regulations.  The
Minister will be able to prohibit business practices that  are  in  conflict
with the objectives of the Bill. I am  happy  that  we  have  with  us  here
captains of the oil industry as well as the lifeblood of this industry;  the
drivers of bulk carriers that deliver petrol,  diesel  and  other  petroleum
products every day. Sometimes they work day  and  night  or  throughout  the
weekend. The petroleum  companies  should  also  listen  to  their  cry  for
empowerment. They only need empowerment.

Regrettably, Minister, the South African Petroleum and Liquid Fuels  Charter
does not specifically refer to the empowerment of women.  This  is  a  major
weakness which  needs  urgent  attention  by  the  department  and  the  oil
companies. It  must  include  shareholding  opportunities,  procurement  and
skills development. The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chair,  the  Bill  before  us  today  is,  according  to  Dr
Crompton of  the  Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy,  ``intended  to  do
renovations to the current Bill, not to build a new building  or  to  engage
new designs or architecture''. It is  my  humble  view  that  this  Bill  is
revolutionary and very progressive.

I wanted to venture into the  Competition  Commission's  argument  that  the
restrictions, or vertical integration, according to  some  studies,  do  not
necessarily promote the entry of small business firms because  certain  cost
barriers or advantages the incumbent firms  might  have  over  new  entrants
could be related to information, industrial  knowledge,  access  to  product
supplies, technology proximity and brand loyalty.

I think I should rather focus my presentation on the charter because I  have
been one  of  the  most  vocal,  sometimes  very  churlish,  sometimes  very
unnecessary - the Chair would shut me up when I  got  to  the  area  of  the
historically disadvantaged South Africans. Indeed the charter, in its  aims,
envisages securing 25% of equity ownership  for  historically  disadvantaged
South Africans over a 10-year period. I think some of  us  must  have  heard
the misinterpretation from Mr Mark Lowe, that there will  be  a  cutback  in
BEE companies over 10 years. Maybe he should reread the whole story.

Many companies were starting to scream loud hosannas to  themselves,  having
achieved the 25% mark. But then, when one  looked  at  the  actual  economic
value owned by black partners - and the commission spoke  about  this,  last
week - it was less than 70%, even though Mr Colin McClelland,  the  Chairman
of the SA Petroleum Industry Association, sketched a very rosy  picture.  He
mentioned the fact that Engen sold 20% of its business to Worldwide  African
Investment Holdings, Shell sold 25% to Thebe, BP sold 25%  of  its  business
and Sasol is intending to effect a 25% sell-off. One just hopes  that  there
won't be any casualties when a close scrutiny diagnoses something  different
to the cases I have just mentioned.

Voorsitter, dan is  daar  ook  nog  sake  wat  sê  dat  ``4  700  vulstasies
landwyd'' meer as genoeg is. Sommige verkoop minder as  100  000  liter  per
maand teen 'n winsgrens van sowat 20 sent per liter of  minder,  terwyl  dit
onder 'n bruto wins van R15 000 voor alle bedryfs- en kapitaalkostes  staan.
Kleiner vulstasies ding moeilik mee met  'n  nuwe  soort  vulstasie  wat  'n
kafee en motorwasgeriewe het. Ons dink aan die  platteland  byvoorbeeld,  en
die townships wat vulstasies sommer bo-op mekaar  het,  wat  deur  wetgewing
verbied word, deur 'n motorherstelbaai daar te stel, soos  in  die  verlede.
Baie van laasgenoemde sit nou in diep skuld.

Die woelinge in Engen is 'n goeie voorbeeld hiervan. Van sy  65  vulstasies,
waarvan 42 swart bemagtiging-vulstasies is, en die  vorige  onttrekking  van
Engen van finansiële hulp, as EFG Financial Services, vir swart  bemagtiging
in 2002, sê Mnr Grant Fincham van EFG: (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Chairperson, then there are also businesses that say that ``4  700  filling
stations countrywide'' is more than enough. Some  sell  less  than  100  000
litres per month at a profit margin of about 20 cents  per  litre  or  less,
while they are under a gross profit of R15  000  before  all  operation  and
capital costs. Smaller filling stations  have  difficulties  competing  with
the new kind of filling station that has a café and car-washing  facilities.
We are thinking of the rural areas, for  example,  and  the  townships  that
have filling stations right next to one  another,  which  is  prohibited  by
legislation, by having car repair bays, as in the past. Many  of  these  are
now deep in debt.

The turbulence in Engen is a  good  example  of  this.  Of  its  65  filling
stations, of which 42  are  black  empowerment  filling  stations,  and  the
former  withdrawal  of  Engen's  financial  assistance,  as  EFG   Financial
Services, for black empowerment in 2002, Mr Grant Fincham of EFG said:]


  This precipitated a cash flow crisis. Total loan book liabilities at  EFG
  stand at around R55m. Of this, roughly R40m is  attributable  to  the  42
  Engen operators financed by EFG.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Let me just conclude then, for  lack  of  time.  It  bothers
one, Minister, that every now and then retailers urge you  to  increase  the
retail margins.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Is it not time that a  forensic  audit  of  some  particular
forecourt sellers  was  done,  because  many  of  them  don't  even  have  a
semblance of bookkeeping these days?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon member, you are  well  over
time.

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, although  these  amendments  do  not  make  for  an
eloquent Act, it will be supported by the ACDP. It is supported  because  it
is an effort to start  a  deregulating  process  and  allow  access  to  the
industry in a complex environment where vested interests  and  conflicts  of
stakeholders result in deadlocks.

The Department of Minerals and Energy had to take the initiative to get  the
process going. Of concern, however, is the excessive regulatory powers  that
are given to the executive, where these matters actually should  be  exposed
to the scrutiny of a full parliamentary process.

Capping of sites and retail licences,  although  necessary,  could  lead  to
increased  cost  and  consequently  put  pressure  on  fuel  prices  to  the
detriment of the consumer. The fuel industry is complex. The question is  to
regulate or not to regulate; or how far to regulate. Either way,  some  will
gain and some will lose.

These amendments, if handled responsibly, can set the process going to  find
an acceptable compromise and we thus support it.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF notes the need to update the  petroleum
products legislation to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  sociopolitical  and
economic dynamics of current South Africa. Proper management of liquid  fuel
will be maintained by ensuring that the Government's policy is adhered to.

The MF strongly supports a charter  for  the  South  African  petroleum  and
liquid fuel industry, and  the  empowerment  of  historically  disadvantaged
South Africans in the petroleum and liquid fuel  industry.  The  control  of
licensing that the Bill suggests is supported  by  the  MF,  as  this  would
ensure the proper management and maintenance of the industry.

The provisions are adequate and the authorisation awarded  to  the  Minister
of Minerals and Energy in terms of licensing is supported. It is hoped  that
the provisions that  this  Bill  establishes  will  be  beneficial  for  the
economy in terms of the costs of liquid fuels.

With the high cost of living and the burden of taxing petrol prices  on  our
citizenry, it is hoped that the Minister's involvement in  the  decision  of
costs would  be  beneficial  to  society.  The  MF  supports  the  Petroleum
Products Amendment Bill.

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Chairperson,  comrades  and  colleagues,  our  Constitution
provides for a transparent, effective  and  accountable  government  at  all
levels. This Parliament today concluded the Petroleum Pipelines  Bill  which
establishes the National Regulatory Framework  and  the  National  Petroleum
Pipelines Regulatory Authority as a custodian and enforcer of  the  national
regulatory frameworks.

The pipelines are a major vehicle used to transport petroleum products  from
refineries to the consumer and  crude  oil  to  the  inland  refineries  for
further processing. This  brings  to  an  end  the  veil  of  secrecy  which
characterised this industry for over 20 years.

The Petroleum Products  Amendment  Bill  is  intended  to,  amongst  others,
promote the transformation of the South African petroleum and  liquid  fuels
industry and authorise the Minister to make specific regulations. The  major
products consumed in our domestic economy  are  51,8%  petrol,  31%  diesel,
9,8% jet fuel, 4,3% kerosene, 2,8% liquid petroleum gas and  0,1%  for  both
heavy fuel oil and aviation gas.

Let me take this opportunity, hon members, to thank all stakeholders in  the
liquid fuel industry for  the  availability  of  petrol,  diesel  and  other
products at our service stations at all times and almost everywhere  in  our
country.

We have approximately 6 million  vehicles  moving  on  South  African  roads
serviced by about 4  900  service  stations  throughout  the  country.  This
translates into between 40 000 and 50 000 jobs  for  petrol  attendants.  As
has been said, this Bill specifically prohibits self  service  in  order  to
protect these jobs.

 The impending entry of Sasol and PetroSA into the  retail  sector  presents
the Department of Minerals and Energy with interesting challenges to  ensure
continued security of supply, preserve existing jobs  and  create  new  ones
while also avoiding the unnecessary proliferation of service stations.

While  both  Government  and  the  oil  companies  work  towards   promoting
efficiency in this industry, we must avoid the temptation of  mass  closures
of service stations in the rural areas as this will have adverse effects  on
the lives of rural communities and undermine our proud record of  nationwide
availability of fuels.

This Bill also gives legal standing to the Liquid Fuel Charter entered  into
between Government and  industry  players  in  November  2000.  We  wish  to
encourage the continued implementation of this empowerment and expedite  the
entry of blacks and women into this industry.

We, however, regret that petrol attendants, drivers and other  disadvantaged
groups in this industry are not specifically  targeted  for  empowerment  in
the charter. We, therefore, urge that the Department of Trade  and  Industry
and other stakeholders give urgent attention to this matter.

We further propose the establishment of  an  industry  score  card  and  the
strengthening and monitoring of  the  evaluation  process.  The  empowerment
evaluation committee under the leadership of the Minister  of  Minerals  and
Energy therefore needs to be supported and strengthened.

The intended policy direction of Government to phase out  leaded  petrol  by
January 2006 presents industry with both opportunities  and  challenges.  We
urge you therefore to handle  this  matter  responsibly  and  with  absolute
sensitivity. This matter will have a positive impact on our environment  and
the health and safety of our communities.

We wish the Minister well in implementing this law and also  wish  to  thank
other political parties for supporting this law.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Mr  Chairperson,  Deputy  Minister  and
hon members ...

... maqabane, ndifuna ukugxininisa ukuze  ndiqonde  okokuba  niyibambile  le
nto  yalo  Mthetho  oYilwayo,  okokuba  uza  kwenza  abantu  bethu  bafumane
iigaraji ezindaweni ezingconwana, hayi ezise  koneni.  Bafumane  ezi  `ultra
City',  eziya  ndawo  esihamba  khona  sibaninzi  kunye  neentsapho   zethu,
sithenge kakhulu, ukwenzela into yokuba nabo bakwazi  ukushishina  ngendlela
engcono.   Ke   ndithanda   into   yokuba   niyipapashe   le   ngxelo   apha
kwii`constituecy' zenu.

Lo Mthetho oYilwayo ubalulekile emaphandleni  kuba  uza  kwenza  sibe  nakho
ukuncedisa nabantu  abasematyotyombeni  abasebenzisa  iparafini,  sibakhuphe
kwiparafini, basebenzise iLPG esiza kuyilungiselela ngamaxabiso ayo,  ngenxa
yokuba  iparafini  iyabatshisa  abantwana.   Ezibhedlela,   apha   kumagumbi
eentsana, abantwana abaninzi abagcwele phaya  ngabantwana  basematyotyombeni
abathe batsha. Ke sizama ukukhawulelana nelo shwangusha esijongene nalo.  Ke
naloo nto  siyafuna  ukuba  nisincedise  ukuze  yaziwe.  Nempatho  egadalala
yabantu  abasezigaraji  siyazama  ukuyilungiselela  nayo.  (Translation   of
isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[... comrades, I want to emphasise this so  that  I  may  accept  understand
that you have captured the essence of this Bill, that  it  will  enable  our
people to own service stations in better areas,  and  not  in  corners,  and
enable them to own ``Ultra Cities''  -  those  places  we  go  to  in  large
numbers together with our families and where we buy a lot  -  so  that  they
can also do better business. So I would like you to announce  this  in  your
constituencies.

This Bill is important in the rural areas because it will enable us to  help
even the people in the squatter camps who use paraffin,  and  dissuade  them
from the use of paraffin and introduce them to LPG, of which  we  are  going
to modify the price, because paraffin burns the children. At  hospitals,  in
the children's wards, among the many children hospitalised, there are  those
from the squatter camps who have been burnt. So  we  are  trying  to  combat
that misfortune that we are facing. So we want you to assist in  order  that
this is also known. Also, the ill-treatment of people who  work  at  service
stations, is something we are trying to sort out.]

The Deputy Minister had a workshop with women in retail  a  week  ago  where
some of these issues were raised. One of the issues raised was the issue  of
training of retailers so that they do much better in managing  their  petrol
stations than they do now. We are also capturing that in this  Bill  and  we
would obviously be working very hard together with  the  oil  companies,  as
well as with the relevant Seta to address that issue of training because  it
disadvantages them.

Ke, sele nivile ke okokuba nalo mqulu  wethu  weenkampani  ze-oli  sasiwenze
nje ngaphandle kwesiseko somthetho. Ngoku, siyenza ibe nomthetho wayo  ukuze
babenakho  ukukwazi,  abantu  abenzelwa  wona,  ukuphucuka  (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[So you have already heard that even the charter of the  oil  companies  was
just drawn up without a legal basis. We are now drawing up a legal basis  so
that the people for whom it is drawn up will be able to progress.]

I have noted the complaint of the comrades about both drivers and  retailers
in the whole broad framework of empowerment.

Nawe PetroSA kuza kufuneka ubone okokuba wenza njani ngale nto ekhoyo  apha.
[You too, PetroSA, will have to find ways to adapt to what is in here.]

We have also raised concerns about the fact that we need  to  allow  imports
of refined products. You need to note,  hon  members,  that  the  refineries
that we have in South Africa have invested a lot of money  and  would  still
invest more. If we were to be careless and allow  imports,  within  a  short
space of time, we would potentially create a crisis in the investment and  I
am sure we do not want that. I hope you can bear with us because  we  cannot
do that.

Then there is the issue of the retail price  maintenance.  It  is  important
for us also to continue to pay attention to that because in the rural  areas
...
... apho abantu abathenga ipetrol  bebambalwa.  Xa  sinokungayenzi  loo  nto
ipetrol iza kunyuka kakhulu emaphandleni. Ke kuyafuneka  sibe  nayo  indlela
yokuba amaxabiso  siwagcine  kumgangatho  othile,  kuba  xa  sinokuyeka  nje
ipetrol iza kubiza kakhulu kuba iye ingabizizo iindleko  kakhulu  xa  abantu
abaninzi bethenga. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[... there are few people who buy petrol. If we do not do  this,  the  price
of petrol will be astronomical in the rural areas. So it  is  necessary  for
us to have a way of keeping prices at a certain level,  because  if  we  are
simply at ease, the petrol price will  take  a  hike  because  it  isn't  so
expensive when many people buy it.]

But if you are selling in an area where you don't  have  volumes,  then  the
chances are that those costs will be passed on to the consumers.

I  also  want  to  assure  members  that  we  will  also   be   looking   at
sustainability of the empowerment that the different  parties  have  entered
into. Since the charter is now law, there has to be sustainable  empowerment
as mentioned in the charter. In scrutinising the deals with  the  evaluation
committee, part of what we are looking at is to ensure that these  deals  do
not go bust in 10 years when the period of the charter ends. So, we want  to
address the issue of sustainability of those deals now, so that we can  work
together to make sure that we protect all the parties concerned.

I thank everybody, especially in view of the fact that all the parties  have
voted for this Bill and  I  look  forward  to  the  transformation  of  this
industry. [Applause.]

      CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AMENDMENT BILL PROMOTION OF NATIONAL UNITY AND
                        RECONCILIATION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  the
debate is about two Bills, as has been read out  by  the  Secretary,  namely
the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill of 2003 and the Promotion of  National
Unity and Reconciliation Amendment Bill of 2003.

I'll start with the first one, namely the Criminal Procedure Amendment  Bill
of 2003. Its main object is to  introduce  a  sifting  mechanism  that  will
prevent the High Courts from being  overburdened  by  unmeritorious  appeals
from the lower courts. The Bill attempts to achieve this by introducing  the
requirement that leave to appeal should be obtained, whilst taking  care  to
avoid the constitutional pitfalls that invalidated  the  previous  leave  to
appeal procedure, as set out in the judgment of the Constitutional Court  in
the case of State v Steyn, 2001(1) SA 1146.

Following  this  judgment,  I  instructed  my  department  to  establish   a
monitoring mechanism so as to determine the impact of  the  automatic  right
of appeal on the administration of  justice.  A  survey  was  instituted  in
order to collect data on the number of  appeals  against  decisions  of  the
lower courts received by the High Courts for a 12-month period -  from  June
2001 to May 2002. It became clear to us that the High Courts would,  in  the
absence of a filtering mechanism, be faced with an  ever-increasing  backlog
of appeals. The  interests  of  justice  demand  that  a  matter  should  be
concluded without any undue delay and the old adage that  ``justice  delayed
is justice denied'' applies.

The main problem lies in the  fact  that  a  large  number  of  appeals  are
completely without merit. But, it is just as costly  and  time-consuming  to
deal with such appeals as it is to deal with  appeals  in  which  there  are
reasonable possibilities that they might be upheld.  The  vast  majority  of
interested  parties  who  were  approached   for   comment   supported   the
introduction of a filtering mechanism by way of a legislative amendment.

The  amendments  further  aim  to  provide  that  certain  appeals   against
decisions by the lower courts and the High Courts relating to  children  may
be noted without having to apply for leave to  appeal;  and,  finally,  that
appeals must, as a rule, be  considered  on  the  written  argument  of  the
parties.

I now come to the second Bill, namely the Promotion of  National  Unity  and
Reconciliation Amendment Bill of 2003, which aims to make provision for  the
following matters:

The recommendation made by the hon President Mbeki on 15 April 2003 in  this
House, namely that  reparations  should  not  only  be  paid  to  individual
victims but also towards the rehabilitation  of  communities;  allowing  for
funds or property which by way of trust, donation or  bequest  vest  in,  or
accrue to, the  President's  Fund  to  be  paid  directly  from  that  fund;
complying with an order made by the Cape High Court to  the  effect  that  I
have to establish a subcommittee on amnesty to consider  certain  particular
cases of amnesty anew; and the correction of erroneous publications made  in
terms of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, Act  34  of
1995.

The TRC and the various committees thereof were  designed  to  be  operative
for a limited period,  whereafter  the  TRC  was  dissolved.  It  was  never
intended that the TRC should  have  permanent  status  or  existence.  I  am
nonetheless charged with complying with an order handed  down  by  the  Cape
High Court, in that I have to establish a subcommittee on  amnesty  to  hear
certain applications for amnesty anew. Accordingly, the Bill  allows  for  a
committee on amnesty, or a subcommittee thereof,  to  be  convened  where  a
court gives an order to that  effect,  or  where  a  settlement  is  reached
pursuant to pending litigation.

This can only be done in respect of an  application  for  amnesty  that  was
previously dealt with by the Committee  on  Amnesty.  An  amnesty  committee
cannot be resurrected beyond this purpose. The  Bill  also  makes  provision
for the consequences flowing from the work  of  a  newly  appointed  amnesty
committee, namely the establishment of other committees that may  be  needed
to deal with the identification of victims, reparations, and so forth.

It is necessary to mention that the provisions  relating  to  matters  dealt
with previously by the Committee on Amnesty were not included  in  the  Bill
as originally introduced. Our attention was  drawn  to  these  matters  only
after the introduction of the Bill. The Portfolio Committee on  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, as we have become accustomed to, has dealt  with
the issue in the same comprehensive manner that it is by now  renowned  for.
The same committee has also devoted an  extraordinary  amount  of  time  and
energy to the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Bill.  I  extend  my  sincere
gratitude to the chairperson, the hon Adv  Johnny  de  Lange,  and  all  the
committee members  for  their  hard  work  in  this  regard.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  I  rise  in
unconditional support of the amendments to the Criminal Procedure  Act  that
gives effect to the judgment  of  the  Constitutional  Court  in  the  Steyn
matter, as well as the amendments to the Promotion  of  National  Unity  and
Reconciliation Act, better known as the TRC Act.

I commence by thanking all those who have made it possible for  these  Bills
to be processed through Parliament. I'm thinking here  particularly  of  the
employees of the department, namely Advocates du  Preez,  de  Lange,  Gordon
and Rudman. To all the parties in the Justice committee,  I  want  to  thank
you very much, once again, for working so diligently on  these  Bills  -  in
fact one of them for a very long time - and for unanimously  supporting  the
amendments.
Both these pieces of legislation are of vital importance and  transformative
in nature. When the amendments to the TRC Act were  introduced,  there  were
just two  technical  matters  that  had  to  be  dealt  with,  probably  two
loopholes in the original Act that only  came  to  the  fore  once  the  TRC
process had been concluded. The first was that the TRC  Act,  and  therefore
the regulations, only allowed for reparations to be paid to individuals  and
not to communities.  Therefore,  the  Act  had  to  be  amended  to  provide
specifically  that  community  reparations  could  also  be  paid  from  the
President's Fund, which in turn allows us now to draft regulations to  allow
for this possibility.

I am very happy to inform you that, as far  as  individual  reparations  are
concerned,  those  regulations  are  already   available   and   have   been
promulgated. Once this Bill is passed  through  the  two  Houses,  then  the
regulations for community reparations can also be dealt with. So,  that  was
the first matter we dealt with.

The second matter was that the Act does not provide that donations into  the
President's Fund should be dealt with in accordance with the  conditions  in
respect of which those donations were made to the fund.  The  Bill  provides
for a small amendment to provide for this.

After the introduction of this Act, two further matters came  to  the  fore.
Two problems have arisen in practice because of the TRC  processes  and  the
TRC Commission now having been abolished. These matters were dealt  with  by
the Justice committee and amendments have been provided for.

The first  concerns  a  matter  regarding  decisions  of  the  Committee  on
Amnesty, particularly where decisions were made not to grant  amnesty  in  a
particular case. Some  of  those  decisions  have  been  challenged  in  our
courts. I can specifically  mention  the  Nieuwoudt  judgment  which  was  a
judgment of the Cape High Court where the honourable Judge Davis, on  behalf
of the majority, gave a judgment where they overturned the decision  of  the
Committee on Amnesty not to grant amnesty and ordered that  this  matter  be
reheard.

The issue of the alleged bias of the Committee on Amnesty  was  also  raised
during the court case. The honourable judges did  not  make  a  decision  in
this regard because it was not necessary. They, however,  pointed  out  that
the appointment of a new committee that would deal with  this  complaint  as
it would pre-empt any further complaints of bias, although no  decision  was
made in this regard. So, that was the first issue that we had to deal with.

The second issue which was of a more technical nature was that  it  appeared
that a particular victim had been reflected as  ``deceased''  in  the  final
report of the TRC commission. In dealing  with  this  matter  we  were  very
careful not to  suggest  solutions  of  processes  which  could  create  any
perception or allow for any allegation to be made that the TRC  process  and
the finalisation of the report were now  being  tinkered  with  politically.
Therefore, we did not want to suggest any procedures to  allow  any  process
to be overturned or to reopen issues dealt with by the TRC Commission.

The way in which we have dealt with this issue is to  very  clearly  provide
in the Bill that if there has been a court decision referring  a  particular
matter back to TRC and, because the  TRC  doesn't  exist  anymore,  we  have
given the Minister certain powers to act within very narrow  parameters,  in
its stead. For example - in this instance regarding amnesty - to  allow  him
to create a particular committee which will have  the  same  powers  as  the
Committee on Amnesty,  to  process  the  matter  anew.  So,  within  a  very
narrowly defined area we have granted the Minister limited powers  but  only
where there has been prior judicial intervention.

Then, a further issue arose:  But,  what  happens  if  further  victims  are
identified  during  the  rehearing  of  the  amnesty  application?  We  then
provided  that  for  those  purposes,  and  I  emphasise  ``only  for  those
purposes'', the Minister has the further power to create  a  committee  that
will have the same powers as the Reparations and  Rehabilitation  Committee,
as well as a committee that will have the same powers as  the  Human  Rights
Violations Committee to process that particular victim  who  was  identified
in this rehearing of the amnesty committee.

So, what the newspapers reported over the weekend - that we have now  passed
legislation to allow for those victims who were not identified and  declared
as victims during the TRC process, to now come forward and be dealt  with  -
is completely incorrect. That possibility is  clearly  not  allowed  in  the
legislation. And, we would not do so for all the reasons given at  the  time
when the TRC Report was discussed.

As far as the matter of the deceased person  is  concerned  -  who  in  fact
isn't deceased - we have passed a resolution to ask  the  Minister  to  deal
with this matter as far as he possibly can, administratively.  If  he  can't
deal with it, administratively, then the  department  should   approach  the
courts to make sure that the courts rectify the matter. This is, of  course,
to be done at Government's expense because it is  not  that  person's  fault
that this has happened. Again, we have tried to  keep  the  principle  alive
that if there are problems with the TRC process, those  problems  should  be
dealt with through court interventions as far as possible,  to  ensure  that
there is no debate or argument or allegation that  a  political  process  is
now trying to undo what was done in the TRC process.

The second Bill is  the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Bill.  This  is  an
absolutely vital piece of legislation for the effective functioning  of  our
courts, particularly over the last while where our courts  have  started  to
build up tremendous backlogs in terms of appeal  cases  at  the  High  Court
level. As you know, in our Constitution  it's  clearly  provided  that  each
person has the right to a fair trial, which includes the  right  to  appeal.
But, just like any other right  in  the  Constitution,  that  right  is  not
absolute. It can  be  limited  in  terms  of  the  criteria  and  principles
contained  in  the  limitation  clause,  to  allow  for  the  same  kind  of
limitations  which  can  be  placed  on  appeals  as  exist  in  most  other
democratic societies.

The history of this legislation is, of  course,  that  at  the  lower  court
level, until approximately 1995-96, we have always had  an  automatic  right
of appeal. I am not going to go into all the details. But, after  the  Ntuli
and the Rens judgments, where similar  matters  were  dealt  with,  we  then
introduced at a lower court level a leave-to-appeal procedure.

This legislation  was  then  taken  to  the  Constitutional  Court  and  its
constitutionality was challenged. Although  the  specific  constitutionality
of the leave-to-appeal procedure did  not  come  up  for  decision  in  that
judgment, what the court did find was that we  did  not  specifically  spell
out in the legislation that when a leave of appeal matter is dealt  with  by
a Higher Court, the record of the lower court  must  also  be  sent  to  the
Higher Court, and, therefore, that the possibility exists that some  accused
may fall through the cracks. To that extent, we  would  be  violating  their
right of appeal. To avoid this possibility, they found that the  legislation
was flawed to that extent. Those procedural aspects had to  be  dealt  with,
quite clearly, by Parliament.

The order of invalidity of the court was then suspended and  the  department
was allowed to correct the legislation and provide for  a  leave  to  appeal
procedure. The department did not do so because it felt  that  there  was  a
need to collect empirical evidence in order to be able  to  show  why  there
was a need to limit this right. This problem was  specifically  one  of  the
issues which was highlighted in the judgment,  namely  that  the  department
had not placed this evidence before court.  Therefore,  before  a  procedure
like this was reintroduced, this  empirical  evidence  had  to  be  gathered
first so that we could be sure that it did exist before we  introduced  such
a  leave-to-appeal  procedure.  We  have  now  done  so  after   extensively
discussing this matter especially after referring it back to the judges  and
magistrates, and receiving their comments in  respect  of  the  legislation.
Hopefully, this legislation will now deal with  all  those  problems.  I  am
quite positive that it will meet any constitutional challenge.

A few aspects of the legislation which I think are important to mention  are
as follows. Firstly, we have, to a large extent,  harmonised  the  leave-to-
appeal procedure between the High Courts and the lower courts.  Although  it
cannot be completely the same, to a large extent we have done so.  Secondly,
one the innovations in the legislation is that we have  retained  the  right
of appeal, both in the High and lower courts, for  certain  children.  I  am
not going to elaborate on this  issue.  Ms  Chohan-Khota  will  particularly
deal with it, except to say that one must also take note of  the  fact  that
in dealing with the Child  Justice  Bill  we  are,  further,  also  amending
section 302 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which  allows  for  an  automatic
review of certain cases of unrepresented children. These innovations in  the
end amount to all unrepresented children  facing  a  term  of  imprisonment,
either having an automatic right of review or an automatic right to  appeal.
These are some  of  the  innovations  that  we  have  provided  for  in  the
legislation.
Thirdly, because of an intervention of the Chief Justice during  our  budget
hearings, we have also made a further amendment  regarding  the  fact  that,
previously, this legislation provided that each  appeal  that  went  to  the
High Courts would always be dealt with by way of an oral  hearing.  What  we
have provided for now is the converse, by providing that  each  appeal  that
goes to the High Court will be dealt with in Chambers, except  if  the  High
Court provides otherwise. Therefore, the  High  Courts  will  now  have  the
power to actually allow those appeals to be  dealt  with  in  oral  hearings
where there is a further need to  air  some  of  the  issues  in  the  case.
However, regarding those appeals that have been  sifted  out,  where  judges
have read the records and feel that there is no grounds  for  appeal,  leave
to appeal will then be turned down, or if leave to appeal  was  granted  but
an oral argument is not necessary it will be heard in chambers.

The honourable Judge Kriegler had certain problems with the  Bill,  which  I
am not going to deal with  in  detail.  The  problems  that  he  had  raised
pertained to appeals of  poor  persons  who  do  not  have  high  levels  of
education. He felt that these processes provided for in  the  Bill  are  far
too complex and that, at the end of the day, some people will  fall  through
the cracks. What we  have  done  to  solve  this  problem  is  to  create  a
procedural right in the legislation whereby these  persons  will  always  be
given an opportunity to apply for legal aid.

Lastly, we just want to say that we  also  had  the  department  placing  an
implementation plan before us to make sure that they can argue this case  if
it comes before the courts again. We have been  relatively  happy  with  the
amount of work done in this regard. I want to thank everyone for making  the
passing of these pieces  of  legislation  possible.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Deputy  Speaker,  I  will  be  dealing  with  the  Criminal
Procedure Amendment Bill. First, the DA  has  no  hesitation  in  supporting
this amending Bill. The principal aim of the Bill is, as the chairperson  of
our committee has  said,  to  reintroduce  a  filter  or  sifting  mechanism
between the magistrates courts and the High Courts in  respect  of  criminal
appeals against conviction and sentence.

Currently, because of  the  2000  Constitutional  Court  judgment  in  Steyn
versus the State every accused person convicted  in  the  magistrates  court
has an automatic right of appeal to the High Court,  as  the  Constitutional
Court ruled in the so-called Steyn judgment that the provisions of  sections
309B and 309C of the Criminal Procedure Act are unconstitutional.  This  has
been having a substantial impact on the workload  of  the  High  Courts  and
some courts are completely bogged down with appeals and with large  backlogs
developing.

The Department of Justice has been monitoring the impact  of  the  automatic
right of appeal on the administration of justice since it  came  into  being
in June 2001 until November last year, covering six  quarters  of  the  High
Court schedule. During  that  period  the  High  Courts  dealt  with  6  609
appeals. The survey indicated that the lower  courts  are  noting  35%  more
appeals than the High Courts are able to deal with.
The survey found that the Bloemfontein High Court, which accounts for  seven
per cent of all appeals, has the most severe  problems  of  all  courts,  in
terms of increasing numbers of pending appeals, which increased from  74  to
405 during that period. Significantly, the survey also clearly  demonstrated
the  number  of  worthless  appeals.  During  this   period   they   climbed
dramatically. Appeals dismissed by the High Courts increased by an  enormous
266% from 188 in the the first  quarter  monitored,  to  689  in  the  sixth
quarter.

Saturation point has been reached in terms of the  capacity  of  the  courts
and the wisdom of sifting out appeals with no merit is clear. In the  course
of the portfolio committee's oversight visits to the High Courts around  the
country in May, vociferous complaints about the situation were received  and
so we are very pleased to be able to support this amending legislation.

The Bill reintroduces, as the chairperson of the committee has  said,  leave
to  appeal  and  petition  procedures  which,  it  is   hoped,   will   pass
constitutional muster as a result of numerous technical amendments.  He  has
indicated a few of these, for instance, a transcribed case  record  must  be
submitted in respect of  an  application  for  leave  to  appeal  where  the
application is heard by a magistrate other than  the  magistrate  who  heard
the case - rather than just the judgment as before; an  aspect  specifically
criticised  in  the  Steyn  judgment.  Also  a  magistrate  who  refuses  an
application for leave to appeal must record his or  her  reasons  for  doing
so.

There are other reasons to support this Bill. It is  a  reforming  piece  of
legislation.  The  amended  section  309  has   created   new   rights   for
unrepresented accused both in terms of access to  legal  representation  and
the requirement that these rights be explained by the presiding  officer  to
the unrepresented accused. It also excludes children  from  the  requirement
of applying for leave to appeal, as indicated by hon De Lange.

The committee ably assisted by Johan de Lange of the department worked  long
and hard to try and eliminate the possibility of appeals and petitions  with
no merit, while at the same time avoiding the  constitutional  pitfalls  set
out in the Constitutional Court's judgment in Steyn v the State.  Only  time
will tell whether we succeeded. Certain possible  problems  pointed  out  by
former Constitutional Court Judge Kriegler at the eleventh  hour  were  also
taken into account and certain clauses  in  the  Bill  were  reworked  as  a
consequence. We do hope we succeeded and we support the Bill.

As far as the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Amendment  Bill
is concerned, the DA will be supporting this Bill as well. My colleague  the
hon Dene Smuts will deal particularly with the issues around  the  power  of
the Minister and the department to correct mistakes, in particular  as  this
relates to the identification of victims.

This Bill follows on the decision of the  National  Assembly  based  on  the
recommendations of the ad hoc committee on  the  President's  proposals  for
paying reparations to victims identified by the TRC. The main  amendment  in
this Bill needed to comply with the decision  to  allow  payments  from  the
President's Fund towards the  rehabilitation  of  communities.  This  amends
section 42 of the 1995 Act by the addition of the following subsection:


  There shall be  paid  from  the  Fund  all  amounts  payable  by  way  of
  reparations  towards  the  rehabilitation  of  communities  in  terms  of
  regulations made by the President.

The necessity for this amendment makes it so very  clear  that  the  initial
concept of the TRC was predicated on individual  admissions  of  guilt,  and
individual  applications  of  amnesty,  victims  being  identified  by  that
process and reparation being made to those individual victims.  But  in  the
five years that have elapsed between the time  of  the  publication  of  the
TRC's report and this amendment to the Act which has gone hand in hand  with
the one-off payment of R30 000 to each of these  identified  victims,  these
concepts have became blurred and transmuted into other ideas by  the  ruling
party.

No doubt all the ANC speakers in this debate will rush to  defend  the  idea
of community reparations and  symbolic  reparations.  Although  we  have  no
option but to support the Bill, necessitated as it was by  the  decision  of
this Parliament and while we have no problem with community  reparations  as
such, we remain convinced that the way matters have panned out is  no  doubt
unfair to certain individuals who suffered greatly and who are  in  need  of
special assistance.

 The other aspects of the Bill providing that the Minister may  appoint  so-
called subcommittees to carry out any residual TRC work, though  cumbersome,
are probably realistic, for instance if, as a result of a court  action,  an
amnesty application or any matter incidental to an amnesty application  must
be dealt with. This subcommittee will be chaired  by  a  judge  -  which  is
reassuring.

Similarly, subcommittees can be appointed  by  the  Minister  to  deal  with
human rights and reparations issues arising from any such applications.  The
Bill provides that the Minister has the power to correct errors in  notices,
proclamations or other publications, excluding the final report. We have  no
problem with that and the DA supports the Bill.

Mr T E VEZI: Deputy Speaker, the Act of Parliament, in  1995,  that  created
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission  process  quoted  the  1993  interim
Constitution by declaring boldly that the pursuit  of  national  unity,  the
wellbeing of all South African citizens and  peace  required  reconciliation
between the people of South Africa and the reconstruction of society.

Much progress has been made in that regard and the final report of  the  TRC
has been tabled in Parliament and a  debate  was  held  on  the  President's
recommendations flowing from that report. Yet, there are  still  some  loose
ends, if they may be called that, that need to be  tied  up.  One  of  these
relate to  the  rehabilitation  of  entire  communities,  rather  than  just
individual victims, as originally provided for in the 1995 TRC Act.

It is a well-known fact that many  of  the  victims  of  apartheid  did  not
participate  in  the  TRC  process  and  could  therefore  not  qualify  for
reparations  of  any  kind.  Yet,  there  are  many  thousands  of   victims
collectively in communities that suffered under apartheid to some extent  or
other. A mechanism to relieve their plight is obviously needed and  the  IFP
supports the idea of rehabilitating communities  as  a  means  of  achieving
wider coverage of victims.

The  amending  Bill  before   us   seeks   to   facilitate   the   community
rehabilitation process. Very importantly, it provides for  a  broadening  of
the definition of victims to include the community at large,  thus  enabling
payments from  the  President's  Fund  towards  the  rehabilitation  of  the
communities.  This  will  be  done  through  funding  from  Government   and
hopefully substantial donations from the private sector. The  responsibility
for  payments  for   rehabilitation   projects,   financial   controls   and
accountability would be vested in the President's Fund.

The IFP supports these amendments but wants to  stress  that  the  community
rehabilitation  projects  should  not  become  a  political  football,   and
decisions on these projects should be elevated above party politics  and  be
made strictly on an apolitical basis. Furthermore, it  is  absolutely  vital
that the communities in question be  consulted  extensively  about  intended
projects so that they may buy into them and be fully committed to them.

Finally, it  has  come  to  light  that  the  TRC's  final  report  contains
classification errors relating to the life status of  certain  victims.  The
Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice   and   Constitutional   Development   has
recommended to this House that the Minister should be requested to  instruct
the department to apply to a High Court  for  correction  of  the  incorrect
classifications and that should more technical errors be  discovered,  these
should also may be corrected through the judicial process. The IFP  supports
both of these recommendations and will therefore support the amending Bill.

The Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill  essentially  aims  to  reinstate  the
leave to appeal and petition procedures that were  originally  contained  in
the 1977 principal  Act.  These  procedures  regulate  appeals  against  the
decisions of lower courts but were invalidated by the  Constitutional  Court
in the so-called Steyn judgment in  2001.  Importantly,  the  amending  Bill
reintroduces the provision for an application for leave  to  appeal  in  the
Magistrates Court and the petition procedures in the  High  Court.  The  Act
provides that an accused person may apply orally for leave to appeal once  a
magistrate has made a decision or an  order  after  a  conviction.  The  IFP
supports this reinstatement, as  we  believe  it  is  in  the  interests  of
justice and would facilitate the administration  of  justice  in  the  South
African court system.

However, the Portfolio Committee on Justice and  Constitutional  Development
discovered that Rule 67 of the Rules of Court derived from the  Magistrates'
Court Act of 1944 did not provide for an instance where  an  accused  person
applies orally for  leave  to  appeal  and  that  an  investigation  by  the
Department of Justice would be required to see if  the  Rule  needed  to  be
amended. The committee requested the  department  to  report  to  Parliament
before 28 November 2003. The IFP supports  this  request  and  supports  the
adoption of this amending Bill.

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Deputy Speaker, hon members, the  amendments  that  the
Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development are  proposing
today may certainly be described as newer, as in introducing a newer  system
of appeals and reviews for our courts.

There are, however, some enormously innovative elements to this Bill, and  I
wish to deal with some of them in my speech. The  first  of  these  elements
involves the manner in which we treat children  in  trouble  with  the  law.
South Africa,  together  with  the  progressive  community  of  nations,  is
committed to treating  children  differently  within  the  criminal  justice
system.

It is a matter of importance, if we  are  committed  to  building  a  better
future and developing a more caring society, that emphasis should be  placed
on rehabilitation, restitution  and  nonrecidivism  when  dealing  with  our
children. The Child Justice Bill, currently before the portfolio  committee,
promises to herald a new  era  for  our  criminal  justice  system  in  this
regard.

The Constitutional Court in the  case  of  Steyn  v  the  State  erased  the
concept of leave to appeal and, with this  provision  and  for  the  reasons
spelt out by the chairperson in his speech, we reintroduce the procedure  in
this Bill. We, however, make an exception for  children:  children  who  are
under the age of 14  years  at  the  time  they  committed  an  offence,  or
children who are between the ages of 14 and 16 years who were  unrepresented
at the time of their conviction and  who  were  sentenced  to  any  form  of
imprisonment may note an  appeal  without  having  to  apply  for  leave  to
appeal.

We also provide for an automatic review procedure  for  children,  which  we
intend extending in the Child Justice Bill before us at the moment. It is  a
mark of a caring society that  treats  its  most  vulnerable  subjects  with
grace and compassion.

Another new feature of this Bill is how the procedure for  leave  to  appeal
and indeed appeals themselves are redefined.  Approximately  R40 million  is
spent annually on transcription of court records  for  appeals.  This  is  a
grossly inflated sum of money and we believe an unnecessary waste of  scarce
resources. The new provisions state that in leave-to-appeal  procedures  the
transcript of the whole record of the trial  will  no  longer  be  required,
except if the application is heard by a magistrate other than  the  one  who
heard the case initially. This will, in any case, be an exceptional and  not
a usual occurrence.

The Bill provides that in the event of an appeal being  heard,  the  parties
may agree that only portions of the transcript  that  are  relevant  may  be
produced before the court. This may, for instance, be the case in  which  it
is only the sentence that is the subject of  the  appeal.  We  believe  that
these measures will indeed contribute to more efficient  management  of  the
resources available to the department.

Finally, the portfolio committee heard evidence that the number  of  appeals
dismissed by our High Courts is becoming increasingly  high.  In  fact,  the
statistics  show  that  the  number  of  appeals  dismissed  by  our  courts
increased by 141% -  more  than  twice  the  number  of  appeals  are  being
dismissed as are being upheld.

The leave-to-appeal procedure, through its reintroduction, will ensure  that
cases that are meritorious will flow through  the  system,  and  we  believe
that this will prevent those that have no merit from clogging up the  system
and burdening it. For the reasons I have stated - that this Bill  introduces
cost-effectiveness,  will  ensure  greater  efficiency  and,  overall,  will
produce a more just regime - I commend the Bill to  the  House.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms C B JOHNSON: Deputy Speaker, hon members, both the amending  Bills  which
are the subject of the debate before the House this afternoon will,  in  the
view of the New NP, contribute to giving all persons equal protection  under
the law and increased access to justice, and therefore both  Bills  must  be
supported.

The Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill has been drafted as a  result  of  the
Constitutional Court judgment of Steyn v the State. In the stated  judgment,
the honourable court was required to  decide  on  the  constitutionality  of
appeal procedures in the  lower  courts.  The  court  evaluated  the  appeal
procedures in lower courts against those used in the High Court and came  to
the following conclusion:


  The situation of an accused person, wanting to appeal from a magistrate's
  decision, is very much less favourable  than  one  who  seeks  an  appeal
  against a conviction in a High Court.

The court subsequently held that sections 309B  and  309C  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act were inconsistent with section 35 of the  Constitution,  which
guarantees every accused person the right to  a  fair  trial  including  the
right to an appeal  and  the  right  to  a  review.  The  court  accordingly
declared these sections invalid.

The amending Bill before us this afternoon introduces a new leave to  appeal
and petition procedure in the Criminal Procedure Act.  It  aims  to  prevent
appeals  from  the  lower  courts  when  they   are   without   merit   from
unnecessarily overburdening  the  High  Court  roll.  It  also  allows  that
certain appeals must be considered on the written arguments of the  parties.
These new provisions will, in our view, assist in the speedy  resolution  of
appeals and will assist in eliminating existing backlogs in our courts.

The Bill also provides for an automatic right  of  appeal  to  children  who
were aged 14 at the time of the commission of the offence  and  to  children
aged between 14 and 16 who were unrepresented at the time  of  their  trial.
Also, persons who were sentenced to a form  of  imprisonment  that  was  not
wholly suspended will have an automatic right of appeal, and the Bill  gives
a procedural right to legal aid.
The National Unity and Reconciliation Amendment Bill will also  achieve  two
very important aims. Firstly, it will allow for the payment  of  funds  from
the President's Fund as compensation to communities for  rehabilitation  and
reparation. Secondly, it will provide for the  establishment  of  committees
and  subcommittees  by  the  Minister   for   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development.

Voorsitter,  waarom  is  hierdie  oogmerke  so  belangrik?  Tans  kan  slegs
individue  kwalifiseer   vir   fondse   vanuit   die   Presidentsfonds   ter
kompensasie. Gegewe die feit dat sekere gemeenskappe in Suid-Afrika  in  die
geheel en ook gesamentlik skade gelei het, sal dié  wysigings  baie  daartoe
bydra dat gemeenskappe  ook  hul  regmatige  kompensasie  sal  kan  ontvang.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, why  are  these  objectives  so  important?  At  present  only
individuals  can  qualify  for  funds   from   the   President's   Fund   as
compensation. Given the  fact  that  certain  communities  in  South  Africa
suffered damage, in their entirety as  well  as  jointly,  these  amendments
will contribute greatly to  these  communities  also  receiving  their  just
compensation.]

We believe that this is in keeping with the spirit and objective  for  which
the TRC was initially established. Secondly, some of  the  findings  of  the
committees have since formed the subject of court proceedings and have  been
referred back to the committees by the court. The  fact  of  the  matter  is
that these original committees or subcommittees are no longer  in  existence
and therefore cannot reconsider these matters. The proposed  amendment  will
now empower the Minister to establish and convene these committees in  order
to reconsider these matters, but only matters that have been  referred  back
by a competent court or which form part of a settlement  agreement  pursuant
to pending litigation.

Die Nuwe NP is van mening  dat  beide  hierdie  twee  wetsontwerpe  absoluut
noodsaaklik is om aan  alle  persone  gelyke  beskerming  voor  die  reg  te
verleen.  En  ons  glo  dat  dié  wetsontwerpe  in   hierdie   doel   slaag.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The New NP  is  of  the  opinion  that  both  these  Bills  are  absolutely
essential to give everyone equal protection in the eyes of the law.  And  we
believe that these Bills succeed in attaining this objective.]

The New  NP  commends  the  department,  the  state  law  advisers  and  the
chairperson of the portfolio committee for two well-drafted Bills.  The  New
NP supports both these Bills. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S  N  SWART:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker  and  hon  Minister,  the  ACDP  has
consistently supported the concept of restorative justice whereby  a  victim
of a wrongdoing is compensated for his loss. It  is  the  responsibility  of
judges and rulers to right wrongs whether the culprit  is  located  or  not.
When a criminal wrongdoer is not apprehended, the  state  should  compensate
the victim because it is the duty of the state to maintain law and order.

The truth and reconciliation process is considered a prime  example  of  the
application of restorative  justice  principles  whereby  victims  of  gross
human rights abuses were able to recount their experiences, and  in  certain
cases forgiveness was requested and extended, and  reconciliation  achieved.
The issue of reparation or restitution for  wrongdoing,  in  this  case  for
gross human rights abuses, is a further  prime  application  of  restorative
justice principles.

In the process of reparation and rehabilitation  emanating  from  the  Truth
and Reconciliation Commission's Report, special emphasis was placed  on  the
rehabilitation of communities. The current wording of section 42(2)  of  the
TRC Act, however, only  requires  payments  from  the  President's  Fund  to
``victims  by  way  of  reparations''.  The  definition  of  ``victims''  is
consequently not broad enough to include  communities  at  large.  The  ACDP
consequently supports the amendments to allow payments to be made  ``towards
the rehabilitation of communities'' at large  where  such  communities  were
the subject of gross human rights abuses.
As far as  the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Bill  is  concerned,  as  it
stipulates and substitutes various sections of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act
in order to reintroduce in the Act the application for leave  to  appeal  in
the magistrates' courts and the petition procedures in the High Courts,  the
ACDP will support these amendments, being of a technical nature and  serving
to alleviate the large  number  of  criminal  appeals  following  the  Steyn
judgment.

The ACDP consequently supports both these amending Bills. I thank you.

Mr M T MASUTHA: Hon Deputy Speaker, hon members of Parliament, comrades  and
friends, today this august House  is  being  called  upon  to  consider  the
passing  of  two  Bills,  namely  the  Promotion  of  National   Unity   and
Reconciliation Amendment Bill and the  Criminal  Procedure  Amendment  Bill,
which, for the purposes of my speech, I'll refer to as the TRC Bill and  CPA
Bill, respectively.

At face value both these Bills appear to  be  aimed  at  effecting  cosmetic
changes to the laws they seek to amend, as was mentioned to by my  colleague
earlier on. Yet upon close scrutiny a different  picture  becomes  apparent,
hence the need for this debate.  The  TRC  Bill  arises  out  of  the  need,
firstly,  to  extend  the  scope  of  the  principal  Act   to   cover   the
rehabilitation of communities, and not just individual  victims,  upon  whom
gross human rights violations had been inflicted of the  kind  envisaged  in
the TRC Act.

This is in response to the adoption by Parliament on 25 June  of  this  year
of the recommendations by the President in terms of  the  TRC  Act  in  this
regard. The Bill is further intended to amend the principal Act  to  provide
for appointment by the Minister  of  committees  to  deal  with  outstanding
matters following the dissolution of the TRC. These matters arise out  of  a
number of circumstances which I now wish to deal with.

Firstly, in the Niewoudt case the  Cape  Provincial  Division  of  the  High
Court found certain  procedural  irregularities  in  the  dismissal  by  the
amnesty subcommittee of the TRC of certain  amnesty  applications  submitted
to it, the details of which I do not wish to deal  with  at  this  point  in
time. The court in casu set aside that decision of the amnesty  subcommittee
and directed the Minister to establish a committee on  amnesty  to  consider
the applications for amnesty afresh.

The difficulty, however, is that the TRC has since completed  its  work  and
dissolved together with all its committees and  subcommittees,  and  has  in
fact already finalised  all  its  work,  including  the  submission  of  its
report, which was officially received by this Parliament on  15  April  this
year. The Bill therefore provides for the establishment, firstly, of  a  new
subcommittee to deal with outstanding matters  that  were  previously  dealt
with by the amnesty committee or any of its subcommittees, should  the  need
arise pursuant to a court judgment such as the one I  have  just  mentioned,
or an out-of-court settlement.

Secondly, the Bill provides for the establishment of committees  other  than
the amnesty committee as the need may  arise.  Thirdly,  the  Bill  provides
specifically for a situation where, as a result of a  decision  of  a  newly
appointed amnesty subcommittee, reparation to a victim  or  the  declaration
of a person as a victim may  need  to  be  considered.  In  such  event  the
Minister may appoint a new committee to do so. Fourthly, where  there  is  a
need  to  consider  whether  an  act  or  omission  suffered  by  a   victim
constitutes a gross human rights violation in terms of the TRC  Act,  a  new
committee can be appointed by the Minister to  consider  such  a  matter  in
terms of this Bill.

Finally, and in response to claims made to the Ad  Hoc  Joint  Committee  on
Reparations during its deliberations that errors may have been made  in  the
course of the finalisation of the work of the TRC, such  as  certain  people
having been erroneously declared dead when they are  in  fact  still  alive,
the Bill provides for the possibility of such mistakes  being  rectified  by
notice in  the  Gazette,  which  may  be  published  by  the  Minister.  The
Portfolio Committee on Justice is of the  view  that  these  amendments  are
urgent, necessary and appropriate to fast-track the completion of  the  work
of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission so that  the  critical  challenge
of healing the wounds of the past through reparation to  victims  can  begin
in earnest.

Turning to the CPA Bill, let me start by stating that  this  Parliament  has
maintained and will continue to maintain its unwavering  commitment  to  the
protection and advancement of the rights  of  all  people  in  our  country,
especially those provided for in the Bill of Rights, including the right  of
accused persons to appeal to a higher court, which is at  issue  here.  This
matter arises following a decision by the Constitutional Court in the  Steyn
judgment, which has already been deliberated upon at length this  afternoon,
that  found  the  current  mechanism  of   sifting   out   appeals   against
magistrates' courts' judgments to the High Court that are without  merit  to
fall short of the constitutional standard of the right of appeal.

Previously, convicted persons had  an  automatic  right  of  appeal  against
convictions  and  sentences  imposed  by   magistrates.   This   right   was
subsequently  limited   through   the   introduction   through   legislative
amendments of sections 309B and 309C, so as to create  a  sifting  mechanism
to prevent appeals that are without merit  from  clogging  court  rolls  and
thus delaying justice for those  whose  pending  appeals  have  merit.  This
sifting mechanism, the court found, had its own  pitfalls  fatal  enough  to
render it constitutionally unsustainable.

Some of the shortcomings arising out of this sifting  mechanism  were  aptly
demonstrated by the learned  Justice  Madlanga  in  casu  when  he  had  the
following to say:


  After the refusal of leave to appeal by a magistrate, all that the  clerk
  of a magistrates' court is required to  submit  to  the  High  Court  for
  consideration, along  with  the  petition,  are  copies  of  the  refused
  application for leave  and  the  magistrate's  reason  for  refusing  the
  application. This is a bare minimum of information that is to  be  placed
  before the judges who consider the petition. Not even the judgment sought
  to be appealed against (or reasons for it) must be lodged with  the  High
  Court. ... Often the judgment refusing leave is not helpful  at  all.  It
  does not  explain  why,  on  the  available  facts,  the  magistrate  was
  satisfied with the proof of guilt or imposed the particular sentence. The
  present  application  illustrates  this  point.  This  is  all  that  the
  magistrate said in refusing the leave ...

The learned judge then proceeds to quote the relevant  magistrate,  who  had
the following to say:


  Hierdie hof is van oordeel dat 'n ander hof nie tot ander  bevinding  sal
  kom as wat hierdie hof geraak het nie en die aansoek om verlof  word  van
  die hand gewys.

The  department  had  a  six-month  deadline  set  by  the  court  to  bring
amendments to Parliament to rectify this defect, which it was  unfortunately
unable to meet, whereupon court rolls had once again become clogged  as  the
judgment took effect. This has necessitated the introduction  of  amendments
contained in this Bill.
In order to give a proper chronological background to the issue at  hand  it
is useful to mention the three eras during which the issue  of  appeal  came
into sharp focus in our courts as mentioned in the case  of  Japhta,  Ndondo
and Ncontana, in the Eastern Cape division, in which the three stages  which
this matter underwent were outlined, namely, firstly the period between  the
enactment of section 309B and 309C, and the Steyn  judgment,  which  is  the
period 25 May 1999 to 29 November 2000; secondly, the  six-month  period  of
suspension of the operation of the Steyn judgment,  which  was  30  November
2000 to 29  May  2001;  and,  thirdly,  the  period  following  the  end  of
suspension which is from 30 May 2001 to date.

Turning to the Bill itself, let me start by stating that  the  committee  is
convinced that the need to  resuscitate  the  leave-to-appeal  mechanism  is
apparent in the interest of maximising efficiency in  our  criminal  justice
system, hence the retention of this system as  provided  for  in  the  newly
drafted sections 309B and 309C. The automatic right of appeal  is,  however,
retained with regard to convicted children under the age  of  14  and  those
between the ages of 14 and 16 if they were unrepresented and were  sentenced
to imprisonment, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned.

The leave-to-appeal procedure provided  for  under  section  309B  is  being
revamped by the substitution of subsection  (2)(b)  with  a  new  subsection
which provides that a transcribed case record must be submitted  in  respect
of an application for leave to appeal where the application is  heard  by  a
magistrate  other  than  the  magistrate  who  tried  the   case.   Further,
subsection (2)(b) contains  a  provision  in  terms  of  which  it  will  be
sufficient if copies of only the  judgment  are  submitted  in  those  cases
where legally represented  persons  were  convicted  and  sentenced  in  the
regional court.

The proposed subsection (4)(a) provides that if an application for leave  to
appeal is granted, copies of the record and of all relevant  documents  must
be transmitted to the registrar of the court of appeal  unless  the  accused
and the Director of Public Prosecutions agree that only some  parts  of  the
record are relevant to the prospective appeal. The  magistrate  who  refuses
an application for leave to appeal must record his or her reasons  for  such
refusal in terms of the proposed new subsection (4)(b).

The ANC supports this Bill with all the amendments it seeks  to  effect.  It
hopes  that,  contrary  to  some  doubts  regarding  its   constitutionality
expressed  by  the  learned  Justice  Kriegler,  a  former  judge   of   the
Constitutional Court, in his recent comments  to  the  portfolio  committee,
these amendments, if put to the test in  future,  will  pass  constitutional
muster with flying colours. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports the  Promotion  of  National
Unity and Reconciliation Amendment Bill. Its aim is to amend  the  Promotion
of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995, so as  to  allow  payments
from the President's Fund towards the rehabilitation of communities.

Section 42 of the principal Act is now amended to read as follows:
  There shall be paid  from  the  Fund  all  amounts  payable  towards  the
  rehabilitation of  communities  in  terms  of  regulations  made  by  the
  President.

The PAC, while supporting payments to  victims  of  apartheid,  repeats  its
well-known position on the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission  and  its
outcome. First  of  all,  reparations  have  been  far  below  international
standards as  practised  elsewhere  in  the  world  where  a  crime  against
humanity was committed. It is not correct that only 220 000  people  in  our
country qualify for reparations as victims of apartheid. It is an insult  to
even these few selected victims of  apartheid  to  offer  them  R30  000  as
reparations. Victims of crimes against humanity throughout  the  world  have
received more reasonable reparations than the victims of  apartheid  in  our
country. This has serious implications. It raises  the  question:  Does  the
concept of crimes against  humanity  apply  to  Africans?  If  so,  why  are
victims of apartheid in South Africa being treated differently?

This treatment of them shows that this  country  pays  lip  service  to  the
principles of international law. Through  the  international  convention  on
the suppression and  punishment  of  the  crime  of  apartheid,  the  United
Nations declared apartheid to be a crime  against  humanity.  The  TRC  gave
amnesty to almost all the perpetrators of apartheid and  to  spies  such  as
Craig Williamson. But a number of former Apla members,  who  fought  against
the crime of apartheid, are languishing in the prisons of  this  country  as
``criminals''.

The PAC demands that all freedom fighters be released  from  jails.  History
will pass a harsh judgment on those who  sacrifice  them  on  the  altar  of
appeasement and the peace of the lamb and the jackal. Justice  should  never
be sacrificed for the sake of political expediency. Reconciliation  will  be
an empty shell in this country  if  former  freedom  fighters  who  did  not
appear before the TRC are persecuted. Because of  the  limited  time  at  my
disposal, I am unable to comment on the other Bill - the Criminal  Procedure
Amendment Bill. I thank you.
Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, the MF is pleased by the  efforts  at
truth and reconciliation that South Africa has  made,  and  notes  that  the
damages endured through the apartheid regime extend  far  beyond  individual
scars and torments. Much damage and  torture  were  endured  by  communities
that to date struggle coping with change, democracy  and  the  freedom  that
our Bill of Rights affords us.

Reports of the TRC show communities that seriously  require  reparation  and
retribution. Many of our Indian communities carry  the  same  burdens.  With
this in mind, the MF voices its support for the provision made in this  Bill
to allow for the  funding  of  these  communities'  rehabilitation.  It  is,
however, hoped that the funds that will be utilised in doing  this  will  be
sufficient in attaining our aims of rehabilitation. The provisions  made  in
this Bill in relation to the Disaster Relief Fund are also supported.

In terms of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill, the MF  acknowledges  the
backlog that our High Courts are burdened with in terms of appeals. In  view
of this, we have no objection to the sifting process that the Bill  suggests
courts utilise to establish leave to appeal. The MF is  well  aware  of  the
South African dilemma of juvenile delinquency, and  is  also  aware  of  the
need to watch over our children. In this respect, provisions made  in  terms
of appeal for juveniles are supported.

The overcrowding of prisons appears to be a  major  issue  in  South  Africa
with prisons estimated to be 65% overcrowded. However, we  want  to  protect
our communities, and criminals  need  to  be  brought  to  justice.  The  MF
supports provisions made in this Bill  to  institute  better  management  of
criminal justice. It is, however, hoped that  their  efforts  to  stamp  out
crime will be more successful. The MF supports both the  Bills.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms N MAHLAWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise in support of the  amendments  to
the Bills. I shall premise my debate on a declaration  in  the  preamble  to
the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation  Act,  Act  34  of  1995,
which is an extract from the Constitution, and I quote:
  The pursuit of  national  unity,  the  wellbeing  of  all  South  African
  citizens and peace require reconciliation between  the  people  of  South
  Africa and the reconstruction of society.

Firstly, I would like us to reflect on and honour the  heroes  and  heroines
of our struggle who died at the hands of state  operatives,  whose  families
have survived gross human rights violations and who are now  at  the  centre
of the objectives of this Bill. In brief, I can  mention  a  few  of  these,
like Matthew  Goniwe,  Sparrow  Mkonto,  Fort  Calata,  Sicelo  Mhlawuli  of
Cradock,  whose  bodies  were  charred  to  ashes  at  the  hands  of  state
operatives, and the so-called Hammer Unit. This Bill  takes  their  families
into consideration.

Section 40 of the Bill has an insertion that  ensures  effective  allocation
of the amounts, as contemplated in the Act. This will go a long way  in  the
reparation process. We also honour the name of Steve Biko,  who  died  naked
in a cell. We remember the disappearance of Vuyisile Mini from custody,  and
that of Bongo and Ngudle, who were tortured and executed,  as  well  as  the
disappearance of many comrades from a number of universities  -  among  them
the University of Natal and the University of Transkei.  Revelations  during
the TRC processes showed that they were tortured and murdered.

So many families and communities were left  destitute  and  full  of  anger,
despair, traumatised and hopeless.  This  Bill  then  gives  hope  to  these
families, as it is the insertion - in section 42 - which ensures that  funds
are being paid for rehabilitation of  communities  and  this  is  what  they
need; as well as section 47(3)(a),(b) and (c), as inserted in the  principal
Act. The previous speakers have already alluded to all these sections.

To conclude, I need to say that we obviously have  a  key  message  here;  a
message that says that the ANC Government is determined to nurture its  laws
and  policies  aimed   at   bringing   about   peace,   reconciliation   and
reconstruction of South African society as a whole, including the  wellbeing
of South African citizens and unity. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker,  I  began  my  speech  on  the  adoption  of  the
Promotion of National Unity  and  Reconciliation  Act  here  in  1995,  with
Quentin Cornelius. I  described  the  night  in  the  Heidelberg  Tavern  in
Station Road in Observatory,  just  below  the  hospital,  when  multiracial
groups  of  friends,  students,  were  mown  down  four  months  before  the
democratic election of 1994. I said in that speech, in the debate  where  we
passed the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, that  Quentin
had been rendered paraplegic, and lived with  permanent  pain.  We  had  all
spent many months redrafting the original Promotion of  National  Unity  and
Reconciliation Bill to the point where we could all support its amnesty  and
reparations  formula  -  despite  the  extreme  results  of  repression  and
terrorism.

Today's speech, I hope the last  on  the  TRC,  is,  quite  extraordinarily,
about Quentin again. I  have  remained  in  touch  with  other  victims  and
survivors from my constituencies over the years, and have dealt with  others
from beyond my borders, but Quentin's case always stood out.  When  I  paged
through volume 7, which was the victims  list  forming  part  of  the  final
report, a few months ago, I was astonished to read  that  Quentin  had  been
killed in the Heidelberg attack. I e-mailed him immediately in  Dubai  where
he has a job, to say that the DA's attempts  to  get  reparations  based  on
actual loss had just been complicated in his case by a vast exaggeration  of
his fate, and that I was writing to the  President's  Fund  in  the  Justice
Ministry. I never received a reply.

I still believe that there should have been  an  appeal  mechanism  for  all
victims erroneously or unfairly excluded. But  the  Justice  committee  has,
however, done the right thing in respect of Quentin and  I  thank  them  for
that. Thank you to the hon  Mike  Masutha,  the  hon  Johnny  de  Lange,  in
particular,  and  my  colleague,  the  hon  Sheila  Camerer.  The  committee
recommended that the Minister should  direct  that  the  department  had  to
approach  the  High  Court  with  an  application   to   correct   Quentin's
classification, and that the department had to bear the  cost.  Any  further
technical errors identified  in  the  final  report  have  to  be  corrected
through the judicial process. May I express the  hope  that  the  department
will publicise this fact, so that other victims will be aware of  what  they
have to do if errors have occurred.

The Bill gives  the  Minister  the  power  to  correct  errors  in  notices,
proclamations and the like, by way  of  notice  in  the  Gazette,  but  this
excludes the final report itself. I fear that there will  be  other  persons
who are the victims of error, because  the  compilers  of  volume  7  freely
admit, in their report, that they may have  made  mistakes.  In  fact,  more
than 1 700 designated victims were lost between the first  listing  and  the
expanded urgent interim measures which tried to compensate for the delay  in
reparation set at R30 000, which we still consider inadequate.

In Quentin's case, the R30 000 will go towards a new wheelchair, costing  $4
000, or his ongoing monthly costs. But let me leave this last thoughts  with
hon members, what he  really  needs  is  a  spinal  stimulation  implant  to
alleviate the constant chronic nerve root pain with which he has  lived  for
10 years. ``It is unbearable and 10 years is as  much  as  I  can  handle''.
That is what he has told me in an e-mail. The neurosurgeon's quote for  that
is R240 000.

It remains a matter of regret for me that  we  are  simply  paying  R30  000
across the board, and that we did not  take  particular  circumstances  into
account. But at least today we can say that this wonderful  young  man,  who
was erroneously excluded, has been properly recognised. [Applause.]

Mr G SOLOMON: Deputy Speaker, in June 1996, three police persons,  Niewoudt,
du Toit and Ras, were convicted of the murder of  Warrant  Officer  Mgoduka,
Sergeant Faku, Sergeant Mpipa and Xolile Skati,  because  the  victims  were
going to join the ANC. The perpetrators were sentenced  to  20,  15  and  10
years imprisonment respectively.

The incident happened on 14 December 1989. The three, perpetrators  together
with six others, applied for amnesty in terms of the Promotion  of  National
Unity and Reconciliation Act, Act 34 of 1995. The matter was  heard  by  the
amnesty committee of the TRC. On December 1999, a majority of the  committee
refused the application for amnesty. The applicants then  proceeded  to  the
High Court, seeking to review and set aside  the  decision  of  the  amnesty
committee, and seeking a further order in terms  of  which  the  said  court
would grant them amnesty.

At the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  the  court  accordingly  ordered  the
following: The decision of the subcommittee on amnesty of the  TRC  was  set
aside, and the Minister of Justice was directed to establish a  subcommittee
of the amnesty committee to reconsider their application  for  amnesty.  The
problem is that the TRC has been dissolved. There is no longer  a  TRC  and,
as a consequence of this, certain amendments had to be made to the TRC  Act,
particularly section 47 thereof, empowering the Minister to give  effect  to
this order of the High Court and its consequences.

Further amendments were necessary to the sensitive and emotional  aspect  of
reparations. It was considered that the current wording  of  section  42(2),
dealing with the matter, only requires payments from the funds generated  by
Government and donations from the private sector, and I quote, ``to  victims
identified by the TRC by way of reparation, in terms of regulations made  by
the President''.

This definition of victims is not broad enough to include the  community  at
large. It was, therefore, recommended that  this  section  be  appropriately
amended to enable payment to be made from the President's Fund also  towards
the rehabilitation of communities. This is important because  reconciliation
and nation-building involve the nation as a whole. This  is  the  heart  and
soul of the TRC process, as spelt out in the preamble of the TRC Act, and  I
quote:


  That the 1993 Constitution states that the pursuit of national unity, the
  wellbeing of all South African citizens and peace require  reconciliation
  between the people of South Africa and the reconstruction of society.

Political parties often forget that the TRC is a result  of  party-political
negotiations. We must be reminded that the Act is a singularly unique  piece
of  legislation,  amongst  the  best  in  the   world,   with   a   built-in
predisposition  towards  reconciliation,  forgiveness  and   peace   between
enemies.

For about two years, the world witnessed  the  proceedings.  South  Africans
and the world at large were stunned and  humbled  at  the  capacity  of  our
people to forgive and to reconcile. We were deeply moved  by  the  unbounded
humanity of the Chairperson of the TRC, former Archbishop Desmond  Tutu.  We
were proud and thoroughly impressed by the competence with which  the  whole
process was being conducted.

The TRC was unquestionably a genuine attempt by the movement of the  ANC  to
deal with the wounds of the past,  to  lay  the  basis  for  reconciliation,
peace  and  stability  in  order  to  proceed   with   its   programmes   of
reconstruction to create a  better  life  for  all  and,  particularly,  the
victims of gross human rights violations. On the contrary, the TRC can  also
be used as a tool of real  politics  by  the  opposition  to  undermine  the
Government's agenda of nation-building, reconstruction and  development  and
the creation of a positive investor climate.

In his state of the nation address before  this  Parliament,  the  President
cautioned that no amount of money could make up for  the  suffering  of  our
people in the past. The President continued that the  Government  has  begun
broad reforms and programmes to give blacks in particular, and  the  victims
collectively, a greater stake in the economy of our country.

Let us return to the sensitive and emotional question  of  reparations.  The
least publicised of the committees  of  the  TRC  was  the  Reparations  and
Rehabilitation Committee. It is also the  most  vulnerable  to  exploitation
for party political ends. This committee was a  working  committee.  It  was
given the mandate, based on the findings of  the  other  committees,  namely
human rights violations and amnesty,  to  develop  policy  on  how  best  to
assist those found to be victims.

According to the TRC Act, the policy  could  recommend  reparations  in  the
form of compensation, ex  gratia  payment,  restitution,  rehabilitation  or
recognition. In formulating the reparations and rehabilitation  policy,  the
TRC based its recommendations on the testimonies and information,  not  only
of victims but also  of  civil  society,  NGOs,  academic  institutions  and
religious groups.

There was no doubt with the TRC that the state and not  civil  society  must
assume  the  responsibility  of  providing   reparations.   The   TRC   also
acknowledged that reparations can never fully compensate for  the  suffering
of victims, but they can improve the quality of the lives  of  victims.  Hon
Camerer,  it  is  incorrect  to  say  that  the  ruling  party  blurred  the
recommendations on reparations.

In brief, the TRC came up with a reparations and rehabilitation policy  with
five aspects. First, we have the urgent interim  reparations  which  involve
small financial rewards, to  cover  emergency  assistance  for  medical  and
educational requirements. This has been fulfilled by the Government.

Second  are  the  individual  reparation  grants  which  include   financial
payments to victims or their  dependants.  As  soon  as  this  amendment  is
signed,  ex  gratia  payments  shall  be  made  to  individuals   or   their
dependants.

Third are the symbolic reparations, the  erection  of  memorials,  monuments
and tombstones and the obliteration of criminal  records  of  those  wrongly
charged in the past and the renaming of public places  after  victims.  This
process has also started.

The  fourth  aspect  is  the  community   rehabilitation   programmes,   the
resettlement of displaced people and access to treatment centres.  This  has
also started.

Fifth we have institutional reform,  and  the  adoption  of  administrative,
legal and institutional steps to  ensure  that  the  perpetration  of  human
rights violations is never ever repeated. For this,  the  justice  committee
has processed substantial pieces of legislation. The ruling party, the  ANC,
has delivered much of these recommendations and shall continue to do  so  in
the interest of victims and the country as a whole.

It is quite clear that the recommendations stretch beyond  financial  grants
alone. The symbolic  community  and  individual  focus  of  reparations  was
considered by the TRC to be vital. The  implementation  of  the  reparations
policy  should  involve  the  whole   nation,   which   will   enhance   the
transformation of our society and the opportunity to restore the  moral  and
social balance of South Africa. It should  also  not  be  misinterpreted  or
misconstrued as an opportunity for enrichment of victims.
I read of a very simple incident of great significance in the  Sunday  Times
of 7 September 2003. It is a story of Onkgopotse Ramothibi  Tiro,  an  exile
of the 1976 national student uprising, a member  of  Azapo.  He  died  in  a
parcel bomb explosion, suspected of being sent by  the  security  police  in
Gaborone. His remains were exhumed for proper burial in Zeerust.

The  mother  of  this  revolutionary  and  freedom   ...   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

The  MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:   Deputy
Chairperson, thank you very much. Essentially, I'm rising to thank  the  hon
members for what I think has been a very good  and  positive  discussion  of
these two Bills, but it's unavoidable to say just a few things  with  regard
to the TRC-related Bill.

First and foremost, I need to stress, as did the President on 15 April  when
he addressed us in this House, that the R30 000 is over and  above  what  we
are doing by way of many other programmes. Therefore, the hon Pheko  is  not
right when he suggests that we are just dishing out R30 000 and  think  that
we have dealt with the  problems  that  derive,  from  colonialism  and  its
apartheid off-shoot,

So, the figure is, indeed, part of a whole host of other things that we  are
doing. I think we need to stress, also, that this is  not  compensation.  It
would, indeed, be an insult if you said you were  compensating  the  victims
of apartheid with R30 000. It would be an  insult.  So,  it  should  not  be
regarded as compensation. It's part of what we think needs to happen.

I agree with hon Vezi that we should, indeed, consult with the  communities,
because they know their needs best, and I want to believe that  we  are  not
just talking about Government consulting  with  the  communities,  but  also
about duly elected leaders of the communities  in  the  various  spheres  of
government and in many other social formations going  to  consult  with  the
people and saying here is an opportunity for us to  address  these  problems
that derive from our past and, indeed, let's use this  opportunity  as  this
community, etc.

The hon Pheko said the figure was low. It's a pity I can't see him  here.  I
wanted to ask him: Compared to what? He's lost interest in this  discussion.
He said it should not only be 22 000 victims. Indeed,  I  would  agree  with
him. We are not just talking about the 22 000 victims, but  it's  useful  to
remember what the law says. The TRC would define those  victims  as  victims
of gross human rights violations, and indeed, they came forward and the  TRC
gave us that list of not more than 22 000 people.

But, of course, as hon Smuts said, there are surely many  people  who  might
have been erroneously excluded.  We  will  not  include  them  when  we  are
actually paying out these sums of R30 000 per person, because we don't  even
know what numbers we are talking about. Surely,  it  would  not  be  a  good
thing to just say: ``Well, hard luck, you are not  part  of  the  22  000'',
when the case is an obvious one. So, hon Smuts, we will, indeed,  work  very
hard and ensure that those who were  erroneously  excluded  do  receive  the
necessary attention.

I want to go back to the hon Pheko's statement. He  said  people  throughout
the world have received compensation. Where in this world?  The  hon  member
has not been able to help us. He doesn't say this is what they  received  in
this country from this person. As matters stand, whatever money  he  may  be
thinking of would have to come from taxation.

Assuming that, indeed, we agreed on a figure and said, look, you  give  each
one of us who happened to be black at the wrong moment in our  history  R300
000 each, then we've got that money in our pockets, we  have  exhausted  the
coffers of the fiscus and yet, indeed, there are many things  that  we  need
beyond the acquisition of that amount. We would  still  be  coming  back  to
say, by the way, these are our actual needs, thanks for the money.  However,
again, we are told, so many people in the world did get whatever.

Let's come back to the issue of the release of freedom fighters  who  didn't
appear before the TRC. I doubt, indeed, if it would be correct to  say  that
there are people who didn't appear before the TRC deliberately, who  should,
nonetheless, be catered for, because then we don't have  any  basis  in  the
law to do so. All of us had an opportunity to appear before the TRC and  its
committees. If  we  didn't,  hard  luck,  honestly.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

National Assembly:

Papers:

1.    The Speaker:


     (1)    Eighth Report of the Working Group on the African Union:
         1. Introduction


              In its seventh report to the House, adopted on 19  June  2003,
              the Working  Group  recommended  that  the  National  Assembly
              consider  convening  a  meeting  of  African  Parliaments   to
              exchange views on the Pan African Parliament (PAP) with a view
              to building a common vision.


              The Speaker had consulted  the  Chairperson  of  the  National
              Council of Provinces (NCOP) and been  advised  that  the  NCOP
              Working Group on the African Union would be  meeting  and  the
              Deputy Chairperson would be participating in  the  discussions
              of the National Assembly  Working  Group.  The  Working  Group
              agreed that it would continue to invite  all  members  of  the
              NCOP Working Group to its meetings.


         2. Meeting of African Parliaments
              The meeting of African Parliaments was held from 30 June to  1
              July 2003 in the National Assembly Chamber and was  opened  by
              Deputy President, H.E. Mr J G Zuma.


              The meeting was  attended  by  138  Parliamentarians  from  38
              Member States of the African Union. Twenty six (68%) of the 38
              delegations included women Parliamentarians,  with  the  total
              number of women Parliamentarians  being  41  (30%).  Delegates
              included 34 Presiding Officers of which 17  were  Speakers  of
              Parliaments.


              The meeting adopted a Declaration which was presented  to  the
              Assembly of the African Union at the 2nd Summit of the AU held
              from 4 to 12 July 2003 in Maputo, Mozambique. The Declaration,
              among other things, urged  Member  States  that  had  not  yet
              deposited the instrument of ratification (of the PAP Protocol)
              to do so by 31 December 2003. The full report of  the  meeting
              as  well  as  the  Declaration  can   be   accessed   on   the
              Parliamentary website: www.parliament.gov.za.


         3. Establishment of the Pan African Parliament


              In  terms  of  Article  22  of  the  Protocol  to  the  Treaty
              Establishing the African Economic Community  relating  to  the
              Pan African Parliament (PAP Protocol), the Protocol will enter
              into  force  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  deposit  of   the
              instruments of ratification by a simple majority of the Member
              States. Article 5(2) provides that the Assembly will determine
              the beginning of the first term of office of the  PAP  at  its
              session immediately following the entry  into  force  of  this
              Protocol.


              At the time of the 2nd Summit of the  African  union  only  16
              countries  had  ratified  the  Protocol.  The   Summit   could
              therefore not decide a date for the first meeting of the  PAP.
              It mandated the Chairperson of the Union, in consultation with
              the Commission, to determine the beginning of the  first  term
              of office of the Parliament in terms of Article 5(2)  as  soon
              as it comes into force.


              The Summit did not discuss or decide on the Seat of  the  PAP.
              However, if sufficient ratifications are deposited before  the
              next Summit, it will be possible for the  Chairperson  of  the
              African Union to determine that the PAP meet  in  any  country
              offering to host that meeting.


              The Assembly  endorsed  the  Declaration  emanating  from  the
              meeting of African Parliaments and also  urged  all  countries
              which had not already deposited instruments of ratification to
              speed up the process of signing and ratifying the Protocol  by
              31 December 2003, to enable the Protocol to enter  into  force
              and the Parliament to meet before 31 January 2004.


              The full text of the Assembly resolution is  attached  to  the
              report as annexure A.


     (2)    Ratifications and preparations for PAP


         As at 8 September 2003, 22 countries had deposited  instruments  of
         ratification  with  the  AU  Commission.  A  mechanism   has   been
         established at an administrative level between  the  South  African
         Parliament  and  the   AU   Commission   to   track   progress   on
         ratification.


         The Speaker informed the Working  Group,  that  the  African  Union
         Steering Committee on PAP, would be convened  soon  after  the  new
         Commission elected in Maputo took  office  in  mid  September.  The
         Committee would consider the progress of ratification,  and  assess
         the possibility of the PAP having its inaugural session  before  31
         January 2004, as per the resolution of the Summit.


         The Steering Committee will also  consider  the  preparations  that
         would need to be made, in order to enable the PAP to meet.


     (3)    Deliberations of the Working Group


         In view of the possibility of a meeting of the PAP early  in  2004,
         the Working Group agreed to focus on preparing  the  South  African
         Parliament  to  participate.  Among  the  issues  identified   are:
         composition of  delegation  to  the  PAP;  election  of  delegates;
         mandates, accountability and reporting mechanisms; Oath of  Office;
         a seminar on the Protocol and the  South  African  Constitution  as
         well as the popularization of the PAP and the AU.  A  programme  of
         work has been agreed to address these issues.


                  (a)   Composition  of  delegation  to  the   Pan   African
                       Parliament


                       In terms of Article 4(2) of the Protocol, each  State
                       shall be represented in the PAP by five (5)  members,
                       at  least  one  of  whom  must  be   a   woman.   The
                       representation of each Member State is, in  terms  of
                       Article 4(3), required to reflect  the  diversity  of
                       political opinions in  each  National  Parliament  or
                       other deliberative organ.


                  (i)  Gender


                  The Working Group recommends: That at least three  (3)  of
                  the delegates should be women.


                  (ii) Political representation


                  Parties need to discuss and agree on  the  composition  of
                  the delegation  in  terms  of  party  representation.  The
                  following options were discussed by the Working Group  and
                  parties need to reflect on them, prior to a decision.


                       Option A
                       If the largest party is to have a majority: 3 members
                       from the largest party and 2 members from among other
                       parties.


                       Option B
                       If   no   majority   representation   is   considered
                       necessary: the five parties with the biggest  numbers
                       could have 1 member each or a variation.


                  (iii)      Representation from each House


                  The  above  matter  is  still  under  discussion  and  the
                  Working Group will report on it in due course.


                  (iv) Executive representation


                  Article 7 of the Protocol states that  membership  of  the
                  PAP will not be compatible with the exercise of  executive
                  or  judicial  functions  in  a  Member  State.  It  is  an
                  established practice within  Parliament  that  members  of
                  the Executive are  not  included  in  the  composition  of
                  Parliamentary delegations. Members of the  Executive  will
                  therefore not be included in the delegation to the PAP.


                  (b)  Election of delegates


                  According   to   Article    5(1),    the    Pan    African
                  Parliamentarians shall be elected  or  designated  by  the
                  respective National Parliaments or any other  deliberative
                  organs of the Member States,  from  among  their  members.
                  Article 5(3) provides that the term of  a  member  of  the
                  PAP shall run concurrently with his or  her  term  in  the
                  National Parliament or other deliberative organ.


                  This  means  that  this  Parliament  will  need  to  elect
                  members to serve on the PAP, if the Chairperson of the  AU
                  acts in terms of the Summit resolution and determines  the
                  beginning of the first term of the PAP to be before  South
                  African elections in 2004. The  post-elections  Parliament
                  will need to elect five (5) members of the  PAP  to  serve
                  until the 2009 elections.


                  The Working Group is currently  discussing  the  procedure
                  to be followed in the election of delegates  to  the  PAP.
                  Recommendations in this  regard  will  be  tabled  in  due
                  course.


                  (c)  Mandates, accountability and reporting mechanisms


                  The Working Group notes that Article  6  of  the  Protocol
                  states that the Pan African  Parliamentarians  shall  vote
                  in their personal and independent  capacity.  However,  it
                  was also noted that delegates to the PAP  represent  their
                  respective Parliaments and for this reason they should  be
                  accountable for the positions they take at the PAP.


                  (i)  Establishment of a Committee


                  The Working Group recommends:  That  Parliament  considers
                  establishing a Committee to process and deal  with  issues
                  emanating from the African Union and the Southern  African
                  Development Community Parliamentary forum  (SADC-PF).  The
                  Committee  would  discuss  mandates  and  receive  reports
                  emanating from the PAP and the SADC  Parliament  (when  it
                  is established) and table reports  in  the  South  African
                  Parliament. This Committee  could  also  be  a  forum  for
                  discussion with the Executive in its engagement with  both
                  the AU and SADC.


                  It will be necessary to establish  this  Committee  before
                  the first meeting of the PAP, which may  be  as  early  as
                  January 2004. Comparative research will  be  conducted  on
                  how  other  national  Parliaments  interact   with   their
                  delegates  to  regional  and   continental   Parliamentary
                  bodies.


                  (ii) Recall of delegates


                  Article 5(4)(f) of the Protocol provides that the seat  of
                  a member of the PAP shall become vacant if he  or  she  is
                  recalled by the National Parliament or other  deliberative
                  organ.


                  The Working Group recommends: That the Assembly  considers
                  the inclusion in the Rules of a procedure for recall.


                  (d)  Oath of Office


                  In terms of Article 13  of  the  Protocol,  at  its  first
                  sitting after the election and before proceeding with  any
                  other matter, Pan African Parliamentarians shall  take  an
                  Oath or make a solemn declaration.


                  The Working Group has  considered  whether  South  African
                  delegates to  the  PAP  should  be  required  to  take  an
                  additional oath in Parliament. The general view  was  that
                  this would not be necessary, however, the  possibility  of
                  amending the current oath to provide  for  affirmation  of
                  loyalty  to  the  concept  of  African  Unity   could   be
                  explored. The Assembly could consider this matter  with  a
                  view to the 2004 elections.


                  (e)  Seminar on the PAP Protocol  and  the  South  African
                       Constitution
                  This will be  the  first  occasion  that  Parliament  will
                  participate  in  a  forum  such  as  the  PAP  and  it  is
                  necessary that all members are informed and  prepared  for
                  the  additional  responsibilities  we  are  assuming.  The
                  Working Group has agreed that  it  is  necessary  to  make
                  members aware of the detail contained in the PAP  Protocol
                  and the implications of participation  in  a  multilateral
                  Parliament and the possible impact on the  functioning  of
                  our Parliament. In this regard, it is  also  necessary  to
                  include a discussion on  the  South  African  Constitution
                  vis-à-vis the PAP Protocol.


                  The Working Group recommends: That a seminar on the  above
                  issues be held before the end of  the  2003  Parliamentary
                  session. This exercise  will  create  an  opportunity  for
                  members to meaningfully engage on PAP issues.


              Report to be considered.

              office of the Pan-African Parliament in terms of Article  5(2)
              of the Protocol as soon as the Protocol comes into force.

4.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on the Local Government: Municipal Systems Amendment Bill [B 49 - 2003]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 3 September 2003:


     The Portfolio Committee on  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  having
     considered the subject  of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems
     Amendment Bill [B 49 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 75), referred  to
     it and classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 75  Bill,
     reports the Bill with amendments [B 49A - 2003].


     The Committee reports further, as follows:


     1.     The Local Government: Municipal  Systems  Amendment  Bill  deals
         with consequential amendments flowing from the  processing  of  the
         Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill   by   the
         Portfolio Committee on Finance.


     2.      The  processing  of  these  Bills  raises  two  questions  that
         Parliament needs to address further at some stage:


         *   The  need  for  greater  co-ordination  between  Ministers  and
              Departments before a Bill is introduced in Parliament so  that
              contradictions between clauses  in  a  Bill  and  sections  of
              legislation adopted in the recent past are addressed as far as
              possible before the parliamentary processing of the Bill.


         *  The extent to which a Portfolio Committee can amend  legislation
              processed by another Portfolio Committee through  attaching  a
              schedule to a  Bill,  even  in  circumstances  where  the  two
              Portfolio Committees are able to co-operate.


     3.     The need to address the governance aspects of municipal entities
         comprehensively has resulted in a change in focus on  the  purposes
         of municipal entities. The  current  provisions  of  the  Municipal
         Systems Act envisage municipal entities, in all its various  forms,
         to be created to provide  municipal  services.  Through  separating
         the provisions dealing with municipal services from  those  dealing
         with the governance aspects of municipal entities by  placing  them
         in  two  different  chapters,  municipal  entities   can   now   be
         established for any function or power performed or exercised  by  a
         municipality. The expression ``functions  and  powers''  refers  to
         all the functions and powers that  a  municipality  is  allowed  to
         perform and  exercise  in  terms  of  the  Constitution  and  other
         applicable laws.  Such  functions  and  powers  would  include  the
         provision of municipal services, as well  as  any  aspect  thereof,
         such as the reading of  water  consumption  meters.  However,  this
         wider approach to the purposes for which municipal entities may  be
         established,  would  also  allow  the  establishment  of  municipal
         entities for functions of a municipality that  do  not  necessarily
         relate to municipal services, such as the provision of  information
         technology support to the municipality in general.


     4.     The Portfolio Committee believes that there is a need  for  more
         information on, and a  better  understanding  of,  the  number  and
         range of municipal entities that currently  exist.  The  Department
         of Provincial and Local Government, the National Treasury  and  the
         (South  African  Local  Government  Association)   (Salga)   should
         contribute towards meeting this need.


     5.     Initially, significant sections of Salga had strong reservations
         about councillors not being allowed to be directors of  the  boards
         of municipal entities. Their concerns revolved  mainly  around  the
         need  to  exercise   effective   control   over   these   entities.
         Following concerted engagement with both the committees on  Finance
         and  on  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  Salga   agreed   that
         councillors should  not  be  directors  on  boards.  The  Portfolio
         Committees are aware of  Salga's  concerns  and  have  strengthened
         provisions that ensure that municipal entities are  accountable  to
         councils without councillors having  to  serve  as  directors.  The
         Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government  is  aware
         that these provisions may not be adequate and will, in  future,  in
         consultation with the Portfolio Committee on  Finance,  consider  a
         review of these provisions, should it be necessary to do so.


     6.     To facilitate reporting by municipalities to the  Department  of
         Provincial and Local Government  and  the  National  Treasury,  the
         Portfolio  Committee  believes  it  would  be  useful  if  the  two
         departments would provide municipalities with standardised  formats
         in terms of which to report.


     7.     In processing Clause 8 of  the  Bill,  the  issue  of  municipal
         managers' remuneration was once again raised. The  Committee  draws
         attention to  its  ``Report  on  Study  Tour  of  Municipalities'',
         adopted on 15 April 2003, and in  particular  section  7,  part  of
         which noted: ``Some of  the  issues  raised  by  municipalities  in
         regard to  the  remuneration  of  municipal  managers  (and  senior
         managers), are fair and reasonable and need to  be  addressed.  The
         decision of the Ministry and  DPLG  Department  of  Provincial  and
         Local Government) to develop firm guidelines  on  the  remuneration
         of municipal managers is to be welcomed. Attention  also  needs  to
         be given  to  whether  it  is  constitutionally  possible  for  the
         Minister to issue regulations in this regard. If  so,  this  should
         be done, and, if necessary, amendments to  the  legislation  should
         be effected''.


     8.     The Committee is aware, of course, that the issue is complex. In
         this regard it notes:
         *  Local government is a specific sphere  of  government  currently
              made  up  of  284  municipalities  of  three  categories   and
              different  types,  which  differ,  moreover,   in   terms   of
              population size, budgets,  service  delivery  responsibilities
              and other respects.


         *  To attract highly skilled,  efficient  managers,  municipalities
              often have to compete with high private sector salaries.


         *  Often,  the  municipalities  most  in  need  of  highly  skilled
              municipal managers are the smaller  and  rural  municipalities
              who can least afford them. Yet to draw the  requisite  skills,
              these municipalities have to offer  high  salary  packages  in
              competition with the financially better-off municipalities.


         *  In terms  of  the  new  model  of  local  government,  municipal
              managers are not  appointed  permanently,  but  on  employment
              contracts of five years. This was a deliberate decision  taken
              by  Parliament  to  ensure   that   municipal   managers   are
              productive,  effective   and   accountable.   The   employment
              contracts  include  performance  contracts  which  set   clear
              performance targets and indicators  and  often  include  bonus
              payments for municipal managers,  provided  they  achieve  the
              targets set. Obviously, because of this, it  is  difficult  to
              provide clear and uniform national guidelines.


         *  Those municipalities that  have  not  finalised  employment  and
              performance contracts with municipal mangers as yet, are urged
              to do so as soon as possible.


         *  There is a need for more  information  on  the  remuneration  of
              municipal managers and the responsibilities they fulfil.
     9.     The  Committee  welcomes  the  finalisation  of  the  report  on
         municipal managers' remuneration commissioned by  the  Ministry  of
         Provincial and Local Government. It also welcomes the  proposal  to
         discuss the findings of the report and for  appropriate  action  to
         be  taken  after  consultation  with  all  the  key   stakeholders,
         including Salga, the municipal trade unions, the National  Treasury
         and the Financial and Fiscal Commission.


     10.    The Committee requests the DPLG to present the findings  of  the
         report at a Portfolio Committee meeting within eight weeks.


     11.    In respect of Clause 11(b),  the  Portfolio  Committee  believes
         that, if municipalities request assistance  from  the  national  or
         provincial governments in regard to feasibility studies or  service
         delivery agreements,  national  or  provincial  governments  should
         provide   such   assistance,   unless   there    are    exceptional
         circumstances preventing this.


     12.    Salga believes that section 86A(1)(b) (i) and (ii)  which  deals
         with the Minister's right to  regulate  or  provide  guidelines  on
         cross-subsidisation of services and  equitable  share  allocations,
         should be reviewed. Salga believes that, while they may  have  been
         necessary until now, they may no longer be necessary.  Salga  feels
         that this review should be linked to a review of other  aspects  of
         the local government legislation. Such a review should be based  on
         the practical experiences of municipalities in  effecting  the  new
         model of local government. The Portfolio Committee referred to  its
         ``Study Tour Report of Municipalities'', adopted on 15 April  2003,
         and other decisions that have communicated the need  for  a  review
         of aspects of local government  legislation,  while  ensuring  that
         the fundamental principles  and  features  of  the  new  model  are
         retained. The Portfolio Committee welcomed Salga's proposals for  a
         review of aspects of the legislation and will take this up  further
         with the Ministry and the Department.


     13.    The Portfolio Committee found it especially difficult to process
         this Bill in view of time  constraints  and  other  considerations.
         The Portfolio Committee on Finance was required, in  terms  of  the
         Rules of Parliament, to confer  with  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
         Provincial  and  Local  Government   on   the   Municipal   Finance
         Management Bill. What precisely ``confer'' means  in  practice,  is
         not altogether clear. The Portfolio Committee  on  Finance  sought,
         as far as possible, to  organise  its  meetings  on  the  Municipal
         Finance  Management  Bill  so  that  the  Portfolio  Committee   on
         Provincial and Local  Government  could  also  participate  in  the
         processing of the bill. However, in view of the length of  time  it
         took to process the  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill  and  the
         heavy work-loads of our respective committees we  were  not  always
         able to sit  together.  We  acknowledge  our  appreciation  to  the
         Portfolio Committee on Finance to the extent that it  was  able  to
         co-operate with us.

     TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA


     DECLARATION


     We the representatives of Parliaments of Africa meeting in Cape Town on
     30 June to 01 July 2003:


     Recalling


     1.     The Statement adopted at the Meeting of African  Parliaments  in
         Cape Town on 28 June 2002, which was submitted to the  Assembly  on
         09 July 2002.
     2.      The  Commitment  by  the  Assembly  of  the  African  Union  to
         accelerate  the  ratification  of  the  Protocol  to   the   Treaty
         Establishing the African Economic Community  Relating  to  the  Pan
         African Parliament.


     3.     The establishment of the Steering Committee on the  Pan  African
         Parliament on 28 April 2003.


     4.     The decision of the Steering Committee at its first  meeting  in
         Addis Ababa on 28 April 2003 on the  necessary  steps  to  expedite
         the process of  ratification  and  the  operationalisation  of  the
         Protocol.


     Noting that


     1.     Although  much  progress  has  been  made  with  the  number  of
         ratifications of  the  Protocol  to  the  Treaty  Establishing  the
         African Economic Community Relating to the Pan African  Parliament,
         the number of instruments deposited to enable the entry into  force
         of this Protocol has not been achieved.


     2.      The  objectives  of  the  African  Union  cannot  be   realized
         effectively without the full involvement of the peoples of Africa.


     3.      The  Pan  African  Parliament  will  contribute   towards   the
         realisation of the aspirations of the African peoples  for  greater
         unity,  solidarity  and  cohesion  that  transcends   the   gender,
         cultural, ideological, ethnic, religious and national diversities.


     Convinced


     1.     Of the critical role that the Pan African Parliament can play in
         furthering the objectives of the African Union and New  Partnership
         for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and  in  ensuring  the  meaningful
         participation of the African peoples in  the  economic  development
         and integration of the Continent.
     2.     Of  the  need  to  promote  democratic  principles  and  popular
         participation.


     3.     Of the critical role played by democratic  institutions  in  the
         socio-economic  development  and  the  renewal   of   the   African
         Continent.


     Congratulate


     Member States and the Commission of the African Union on the  promising
     and impressive progress made in establishing the Organs of the  African
     Union.


     Urge National Parliaments


     1.     To monitor developments in the African Union  and  to  establish
         working groups or committees that will look  into  issues  relating
         to  the  African  Union,  Pan  African  Parliament  and   the   New
         Partnership for Africa's Development and to engage  the  electorate
         in this process.
     2.     To engage in the political processes towards  the  establishment
         of  Regional   Parliaments   where   appropriate,   to   facilitate
         deliberation on matters of common interest  with  the  Pan  African
         Parliament.


     Request the Steering Committee


     1.     To work closely with the Commission  of  the  African  Union  in
         making all necessary preparations for the  early  establishment  of
         the Pan  African  Parliament,  including  the  preparation  of  all
         documents for consideration and debate by National Parliaments.


     Strongly urge


     1.      Member  States  that  have  not  deposited  the  instrument  of
         ratification to do so by 31 December 2003.


     2.     The Assembly of the African Union to determine the seat  of  the
         Pan African Parliament and target date for its first session.


     3.     Member States to expedite, where appropriate  the  establishment
         of Regional Parliaments with lawmaking powers.


     4.     Governments to  submit  early  drafts  of  Protocols  and  other
         documents related to the African Union  to  Parliaments  of  Member
         States for consideration and input prior to adoption.
