                    CHANGES IN SA CONTAIN MESSAGE OF HOPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr V G SMITH (ANC): Madam Speaker, The Star newspaper on Friday, 20 June,
published a letter by Dr Rob Reid from Craighall, Johannesburg. Dr Reid
says he has recently returned home to South Africa for a three week visit,
after an absence of more than three years. Dr Reid continues, in his
letter, to recount all his impressions of the changes that have taken
place, which he says contain a strong message of hope.

We agree with Dr Reid. This is what we mean when we say the tide has
turned. Dr Reid advises further that we need to continue to intensify the
fight against criminals, and finally he notes that his only twinge of
disappointment is that we who live here seem to be unaware of the huge
improvements occurring around us. We urge all South Africans to also tell
their positive stories like Dr Reid, and become goodwill ambassadors of our
country. Thank you. [Applause.]

                       DEPLOYMENT OF SA TROOPS IN DRC

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv H C SCHMIDT (DP): Madam Speaker, days after the threatened closure of 1
Military Hospital, it was reported that SANDF troops deployed in the DRC
may not all have passed medical tests, as required by the United Nations
regulations.

The SPEAKER: Hon Ministers, I suggest  you  may  want  to  listen  to  this.
[Interjections.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Thank you, Madam Speaker, it appears as if the medical
services in the SANDF are in disarray, and this has extended to deployments
in the DRC and Burundi. Despite denials by the Ministry, allegations
continue to persist that all three confirmed medical evacuations have in
fact been South African soldiers. United Nations regulations forbid the
deployment of HIV-positive soldiers as part of United Nations operations.

What is more disconcerting is the fact that South Africa is to pay the
amount of approximately R600 million for the deployment of troops to the
DRC. Something must be wrong when the United Nations is only prepared to
pay R200 million to United Nations deployment whilst the South African
Government must foot the remaining R600 million. It does not make sense at
all, and will discourage any troop-contributing nation to assist the United
Nations on a voluntary basis in rendering assistance to a foreign country.
The Minister should indicate to Parliament the great difference between the
amount to be paid by the United Nations in comparison to the total cost of
the deployments to be carried by the South African taxpayer. I thank you.

                            NATIONAL HEALTH BILL

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Madam Speaker, the IFP views with great concern the
requirements in the newly published National Health Bill for certificates-
of-need licences to be issued by the director-general for all health
activities. This is a limiting and destabilising requirement and moves
health services further away from the route of public partnerships and
incentives to improve levels of care in Government institutions.

Our health policy is already burdened by social engineering that is
idealistic, but impractical. The belief that a director-general can have or
acquire sufficient information to know exactly what is needed by which race
or gender or economic group to equalise health care countrywide, is a naive
dream. It opens the way for huge unintended consequences, patronage and
corruption.

Furthermore, the need for all health establishments to subscribe to
national norms and standards, instead of minimum norms and standards,
introduces yet another form of centrist control. The Bill takes us
backwards, and will further compromise accountability and efficiency in
public health services. The routes of incentives and public-private
partnerships to narrow the gap between public and private health services
are the preferable routes.

The IFP calls on the public to oppose this direction before the Bill
becomes law. Thank you.

                  HONORARY DEGREE TO FORMER GARDENER AT UCT

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof S S RIPINGA (ANC): Madam Speaker, former hospital sweeper and
gardener, Mr Hamilton Naki, who worked alongside Prof Chris Barnard for
many years, was recognised with an honorary degree: Master of Sciences in
Medicine at the University of Cape Town, on 21 June 2003. Naki also worked
in the laboratory where he learned to anaesthetise a variety of animals. He
did this work until his retirement, while being registered as a gardener.
Despite years of paramedical work, he was awarded only a gardener's
pension. Naki's story emphasises the need for us to deal unreservedly with
the racist legacy that continues to characterise our society.

The ANC congratulates Hamilton Naki on receiving this award from the
University of Cape Town. However, the ANC acknowledges that his work was
not adequately compensated by the hospital where he worked for so many
years, and this remains a challenge. I thank you. [Applause.]

           ASSASSINATING THE CHARACTER OF PREMIER M VAN SCHALKWYK
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Madam Speaker, from the results of the
latest Markinor polling it is clear that the DA has failed in their attempt
to assassinate the character of Premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk of the
Western Cape. In this poll, Premier Van Schalkwyk emerged as the top
candidate for premiership of the province. The support for Van Schakwyk has
clearly indicated that the New NP is truly representative of all South
Africans.

He is the first-choice Premier for 40% of coloured people in the Western
Cape, 20% of black people and 23% of white people. This confirms that the
DA has been underestimating the intelligence of South African voters. This
also proves that the DA's allegation that Premier Van Schalkwyk is an
illegitimate Premier is unfounded. Theuns Botha, the DA leader in the
Western Cape, is favoured as Premier by only 6% of the coloured people, 1%
of black people and a very predictable 18% of white people. Sadly, this
also proves that the racist message of the DA by spreading fear has been
successful in some parts of the white community.

The good news is that Van Schalkwyk is the first-choice Premier of 28% of
DA supporters. This is bigger than the support Botha gets from his own
people as a potential Premier. The results show clearly that Botha is an
illegitimate leader in the Western Cape. This gives an opportunity to the
DA to get rid of Mr Botha, who also called his own leader, the hon Leon,
``politically childish''. Maybe the hon Leon should consider himself as a
possible candidate for the leadership in the Western Cape or fall back on
the infamous Mr Morkel. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

                               PERSONAL DEBTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE (ACDP): Madam Speaker, the Reserve Bank puts household
debt at 51% of household income, while over five months in the last year
more than 130 000 summonses for unpaid debts were issued. A recent study
has found that this is costing the economy about R500 million per month,
with 3 000 individuals facing debt judgments each month. This problem is
most evident among low- and middle-income earners, where increases in
education, medical and household costs have outstripped the rise in
salaries over the past five years.

Almost half of those facing debt judgment find themselves in trouble for
failing to repay money lent to them by microlenders. The cost of furniture
bought on account, municipal and other accounts are also adding to this
strain.

The ACDP calls for a limit on garnishee orders whereby money is taken off
employees' pay cheques to settle debts. This will prevent people from
falling into a never-ending spiral of debt which can lead to social
instability and fraud.

We urge Government to offer incentives to employers to educate staff in
financial matters and expand free education and training facilities to
offer financial education programmes.

It is unacceptable that retail creditors ignore a buyer's credit record.
Strict credit limits must be imposed to prevent large amounts of credit
being offered to those who do not have the means to repay it. Lending laws
must be adhered to and we must advise that retailers offering credit must
explain fully to the buyer the implications of repayment.

                         CONVICTION OF CHILD RAPISTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N B GXOWA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the increase in the average rate of
convictions of child rapists has reportedly been confirmed by the national
prosecution office. It means that more and more child rapists are finding
themselves behind bars. To facilitate this positive development, the ANC
believes that people who commit these hideous crimes must be given harsher
sentences.

We commend the achievements of the Departments of Justice and of Social
Development in this regard. We call on all of our people, communities,
families, cultural and religious institutions to protect and advance the
rights of children and to report to the police all those involved in
destroying the beautiful future of humanity, namely our children. We say to
the rapists: We love our children, do not destroy them. [Applause.]

                         MOB JUSTICE AND VIGILANTISM

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J T MASEKA (UDM): Madam Speaker, we have received with  dismay  the  news
that in the past three days four  people  died  as  a  result  of  vigilante
actions in the Nyanga area.

At the weekend alleged train robbers were dragged from a shebeen  in  Kosovo
informal settlement near Phillipi, stripped, stoned to death  and  then  set
alight. This follows on another necklacing incident that  have  plagued  the
lives of people in Vosloorus in the East Rand, and in Bram  Fischerville  in
the past few days.

It is cause for grave concern that these acts of cruelty and mob justice
seem to be on the increase. Because of the failure to deal with crime,
South Africans who are largely peace-loving and nonviolent are no longer
willing to sit around idly whilst their possessions are stolen and their
loved ones raped and murdered.

The community knew the recent necklace victims as they were the alleged
members of a gang of thieves who terrorised commuters boarding trains in
and around the Peninsula. A radical rethink on crime prevention is required
if we are to avoid the spectre of mob justice in our communities.
Antivigilantism campaigns will be just a futile exercise until the
Government does more to protect its citizens. If action is not taken to
avoid these cases, people will assume that the Government does not care and
does not have the capacity to deal with the problem.

                              VIGILANTE JUSTICE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: In recent weeks, kangaroo court killings took place on
the east Rand and the local newspaper did some research to find out why
these killings took place. I wish to quote from the findings of the
newspaper:


  Two bodies were found next to N3 outside Vosloorus, but as one Vosloorus
  resident who would prefer to remain anonymous told The Advertiser, the
  police and the South African Justice system cannot cope with criminals.
  The police just cannot do enough, the criminals are not scared because
  most of the time they do not get caught. And when they do, they do not go
  to prison. They get let off, come back and rob us again and again and
  again.


  According to the man the vigilante justice system, be it brutal, is the
  only way they can fight criminals. We are going to burn them, he said,
  those two men were lucky because they could not find tyres or they would
  have necklaced them. He believed that mob justice is the only way to
  scare criminals. We will burn them until they stop, he insisted.

The public outcry is clear, they have lost faith in the criminal justice
system. Can the ANC reassure South Africans that there is a solution to the
crime problem, and will they have at some stage in the near future be able
to say that they have it under control and will reduce the crime?

                         LAND AND LAND DISPOSSESSION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs R A NDZANGA (ANC): During this month of June, we commemorate the 90th
anniversary of the 1913 Land Act. We commend the Department of Agriculture
and Land Affairs on its continuing efforts, aimed at reversing the 90 years
of racial land dispossessions. The Land Act of 19 June 1913, together with
various pieces of legislation, was used by racist regimes of the past to
dispossess millions of Africans of their rights to land.

The crippling impact of the past policies, among other things the
entrenchment of poverty and underdevelopment of the dispossessed, demands
that we move at the fastest possible speed in addressing the legacy of
forced removals, landlessness and homelessness. The development of viable
rural economic projects is part of a broader strategy to push back the
frontiers of poverty. We urge our communities to participate in the IDPs to
ensure that rural economies benefit.

                  ACACIA PARK AS MICROCOSM OF SOUTH AFRICA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C M LOWE (DA): Madam Speaker, crime is rampant in Acacia parliamentary
village just as it is elsewhere in South Africa. The difference is that in
Acacia Park we have a 24-hour police guard and an onsight public works
management office. Security on the gate is cursory and the response time
for calls to help is dismal given the short distances involved. There are
reports of illegal tenants but the occupancy audit which is finally being
carried out after months of delay is not checking the tenants are who they
claim to be. Perhaps everyone renting a unit should be required to sign an
affidavit stating who is authorised to live in their house; then if they
sublet they can be held to account.

The police complain that when suspects are identified who were related to
MPs, they are pressured by the MPs to drop the cases or the complainants
withdraw the charge to protect the perpetrators. If the police are giving
in to this pressure, it is corruption. This must be exposed and action
taken. Acacia Park is a microcosm of South Africa: Rampant crime,
inadequate policing and political interference to ensure inaction. It is
unacceptable.

                   THE NEW PLASTIC BAGS AND RELATED ISSUES

                             (Draft Resolution)
Prof H NGUBANE (IFP): Madam Speaker, the replacement of the old plastic
bag, which was a hazard to the environment, with the new thicker, more
environmentally friendly plastic bag was necessary to stop the damage that
was being caused by the old bags. There are, however, concerns and issues
that were raised and need to be addressed.

Among these is the issue of the increase in shoplifting, but potentially of
far greater consequence will be the loss of thousands of jobs in the retail
and manufacturing sectors. In order to put a stop to this potential
problem, as well as sorting out the other issues and concerns that have
been expressed, all the relevant role-players need to work together. We
have to make a success of the implementation of this law and iron out all
the problems that have been experienced because it will be to our benefit
in the long run.

                        ANC's SALUTE TO YOUNG FARMER

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P A GERBER (ANC): Madam Speaker, the dawn of our new democracy has
unfortunately not led to the end of racism in our rainbow nation. However,
the ANC salutes brave young people such as the young Afrikaner farmer from
the small village called Tom Burke in the Limpopo province who had the
courage of his convictions to stand up and expose the racist deed concocted
by the organisers of the yearly Miss Marula Beauty Competition. The
organisers cancelled the beauty contest after they discovered that two
young black girls had entered as contestants.

We salute Mr Gerard Vos also known as Ntsini in Tswana, who, amidst great
pressure from his tightknit farmer community, risking the possibility of
being alienated, still felt so strongly about this act of injustice and
blatant racism that he exposed it. The ANC is committed to building a
nonracial, nonsexist South Africa and calls on all communities to emulate
people such as Mr Gerard Vos. [Applause.] Ke a leboga, Gerhard Vos [I thank
you, Gerhard Vos].

Down with racism, down!

HON MEMBERS: Down! [Applause.]

                     REDEPLOYMENT OF ADDITIONAL OFFICERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J SCHIPPERS (New NP): Speaker, in the Western Cape, and across South
Africa, we must protect our communities, our streets, our homes and our
families from the harm of crime and violence. Therefore, the New National
Party welcomes the announcement made by the Acting Deputy Provincial
Commissioner, Andre Pruis, with regard to the redeployment of additional
officers in the Western Cape.

The additional police will assist the 302 officers  brought  in  from  other
provinces  last  week  to  fight  crime,  mainly  on  the  Cape  Flats.  The
additional officers will include police from the Dog Unit with sniffer  dogs
from other provinces; as well as 27 detectives  who  will  assist  with  job
training and other issues. A further eight serious and  violent  crime  unit
detectives - four from the Eastern Cape and  four  from  the  national  head
office - will also be deployed in Khayelitsha.

Madam Speaker, the New National Party would also like to congratulate the
SAPS on the success of the Operation Tswikila. A total of 2 212 people were
arrested in the Cape Peninsula during this operation. Of the 2 212 arrests,
974 were involved in serious crime such as murder, rape and armed robbery.

I thank you. [Applause.]

                            HIV/AIDS IN THE SANDF

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I just want to put some facts to
the House. First of all, just to say to the House that 1 Military Hospital
in Pretoria is the Level 4 United Nations Hospital for Southern Africa.
This means that all members of the United Nations' missions deployed in the
region are evacuated to 1 Military Hospital if they require attention. In
2002 and 2003 the position has been that five members of the South African
National Defence Force, SANDF, were evacuated to 1 Military Hospital - I
say five in 2002 and three in 2003. None of them, and I underline it, not
one of those eight people was an HIV/Aids case. The records are at the 1
Military Hospital, and they can be found.

There is a particular case of one soldier, that now makes the number nine,
who was evacuated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the DRC, and who
was a HIV/Aids case - he was terminally ill. He was not from South Africa,
but from one of the other countries, and I am not free to reveal the name
of the country. Now, for members of the South African Parliament to make
statements that disparage the standing of the SANDF when we have clearly
said here that South Africa never deploys abroad any member that is HIV
positive, is really irresponsible on our part because we become instruments
of propaganda against the SANDF.

There is one case that is of course correct. It is of one member, who was
not mentally healthy, who did go out of the country, and who was actually
not officially deployed. He smuggled himself into the unit, was picked up
in Burundi four days later and was returned to the country. He left on the
11th, was detected on the 15th and was back in the country on that same
day. That was a mental case - not an extreme case, but a case nevertheless.
[Interjections.] I am just putting these issues before the House, because
anybody who has ever run a big institution, like a prison, will know that,
even from Robben Island, there have been cases where people smuggled
themselves out. That has happened.

Now with regard to the issue of oxygen. None of our deployments run short
of supplies. None. What we are busy with in the eastern Congo is that we
are making a new deployment. Some of the supplies are already there; some
of the equipment is already there and some of it is on its way. The
transportation of equipment and supplies is the responsibility of the
United Nations in order to save the budget of the nation. The UN
commissioned a company to move those things. They resolve to take the
equipment by sea, and then airlift it into Bunia and Kindu. They were a day
late. Some elements in the SANDF, who are not loyal to this Government,
smuggle information out like that, and create the impression that there is
a lack of supplies and rations. They manage to get the word through to the
opposition, and the opposition picks up this inaccurate information, and
pass it on to the country. [Time expired.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, your time for a statement has expired.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I thought, Madam Speaker, that there is a second
matter.

The SPEAKER: No, I gave you time to make up for the fact that you missed
out.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I will give you the budget issue next week.

                              GARNISHEE ORDERS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker,
thank you very much. I am responding to the ACDP's call for a limit on
garnishee orders.

Madam Speaker, we cannot make an undertaking that we are going to place a
limit, or limits, on garnishee orders. Garnishee orders is a very important
means of ensuring that people honour their debt. What we can certainly
undertake to do is to conduct an investigation of the use or abuse, or
misuse, of the garnishee orders by a whole host of people, including public
servants within the Department of Justice. We will make that undertaking,
and indeed we will conduct that investigation, because quite a number of
very important people, including my colleague the Minister of Finance, has
brought this to our attention. But this is all we are undertaking to do.
                             LAND REDISTRIBUTION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I
am responding to the statement made by the hon Ndzanga.

Just to say that, indeed, we are happy that our Government has sought to
redress the impact of the 1913 Land Act in the way in which it has
committed the resources to ensure that we can speedily resolve those
challenges that a majority of our people face. It would also ensure that,
at least, those landowners who are so affected can also be relieved of
waiting for longer. It is, again, our commitment that we will do whatever
is necessary to ensure that we are able to speedily resolve all the
outstanding claims of restitution. It would also ensure that we continue to
consider all other matters of land redistribution and that, indeed, we can
reach an equitable and a just land dispensation in South Africa.

To  this  affect,  it  is  often  said  that  some  of  the  nongovernmental
organisations, such as  the  Surplus  People's  Project,  found  it  fit  to
actually question and challenge the commitment of  Government,  particularly
through the Budget for land reform -  that  this  Government  has  not  done
enough towards reversing the legacy of our past.  I  want  to  say  to  this
House, the Budget, as it was tabled, and as it has been tabled in the  past,
is a clear indication of how  much  this  Government  has  committed  itself
towards reversing the impact of land dispossession in the country.  I  thank
you, Madam Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we've had three ministerial responses. The
Minister of Defence announced that he will deal with the budget issue next
week. I thought I should tell you that the House will not be in session.
[Laughter.] I take it you don't want to address an empty House.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I understand from my colleagues
that they will not be addressing the House, and we will not use our full
quota, so I will take the remaining time.
The SPEAKER: No, you won't take the remaining time, you're allowed your one-
and-a-half minutes for the outstanding question. So you may have the one
and a half minutes for the outstanding question.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: May I do so, Madam Speaker?

The SPEAKER: Yes, you may.

                         BUDGET: DEPLOYMENT OF SANDF

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: With regard to the issue of the budget, again, I
think, we've addressed the issue of the budget before. We said to the House
that, as a general approach to the budget, Defence does not budget for
unforeseen expenditure. That is for reasons which have been explained, and
which cannot be challenged. Whenever a commitment is in place, we are then
entitled to budget for it. What has happened in the DRC in the recent
period is that ceasefire agreements have been reached and processes arrived
at, which have increased the size of the deployment that was already in
place. This has increased the need to budget for it, and there have been -
as a result of the tensions in the eastern Congo - which resulted in fresh
deployments being required. That is all unforeseen, and the United Nations
will have to meet its obligations once we have submitted the necessary
budgets. They then adjust in keeping with that.

The stories in the newspapers - that we are in disarray, that we have not
done proper budgeting, and so on - fail to understand the internal
operation of the budget of missions of this nature. Of course, the process
is being handled now by the Treasury, and we will be in a position to show
that these missions, having now come as fresh deployments, cost so much.
The UN has a specific amount to carry, and the country has a specific
amount to carry. I don't think it is a proper thing to alarm the country by
suggesting that we don't know what we're doing, and that there is a deep
hole into which we are throwing the electorate's money. I thank you, Madam
Speaker.
The SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister, and thank you for your brevity.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                (Decision of Question on Votes and Schedules)

The SPEAKER: Members, I wish to thank parties for advising the staff on the
Votes on which they wish to make declarations and on which they will record
objections. The information will greatly assist in processing this
afternoon. I will put each Vote and ask parties for Declarations of Vote as
they have indicated. After this, I will put the Vote for Decision. By
agreement, Declarations will be limited to two minutes. The bells will be
rung for one minute for the first division on a Vote, but for only 15
seconds on subsequent divisions.

Vote No 1 - The Presidency - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, last week the Leader of the Opposition
strongly suggested that we focus on the real, pertinent issues of job
creation, crime prevention and the scourge of Aids. As usual, the President
met this with the stock response of race, conveniently ignoring tribalism
in its many ethnic nostrums. Unfortunately President Mbeki's flawed methods
of debate are too well known. He attributes words and motives to his
critics that are simply not there. He therefore, like Don Quixote, attacks
his own straw men - which in reality are phantoms of his imagination - and
he does not engage in a real debate advanced by his opponents and critics.
[Interjections.] Pres Mbeki made a fundamentally fallacious, if not
outrageous and undemocratic accusation. He said of millions and millions of
South Africans who legitimately opposed his party and differ with his
presidency, that:


  they do not see a role for themselves as active and conscious
  participants in the process of national reconciliation.

It is time to get out of this dead-end street and onto the high road ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker, we have a very long afternoon ahead of us and
if the ANC is going to behave like this from the very first speech, I would
urge that we have some decorum in the House.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, please take your seat.

Mr W J SEREMANE: Unpalatable. It is time to get out of this dead-end street
and onto the high road of sustained economic growth, real job creation and
a massive campaign to combat Aids and fight crime. It is the President's
failure to address these issues in a real and inclusive fashion that gives
us no choice but to oppose this Budget Vote and to call for a division on
this Vote. [Applause.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Speaker, die toespraak wat die agb President gehou het
tydens die debat oor die finale verslag van die WVK was 'n baie belangrike
mylpaal op die pad van versoening in Suid-Afrika, maar versoening is 'n
proses wat nie oornag bereik kan word nie en waaraan elke landsburger
aktief moet werk om dit 'n werklikheid te maak. Veral politici het ook 'n
verantwoordelikheid om versoening te laat slaag. En wat ons nie kan
bekostig nie, is dat in die aanloop tot die volgende verkiesing,
polarisasie egter gaan verskerp, in plaas van om versoening 'n werklikheid
te maak. En ongelukkig as 'n mens oordeel aan die trant van die DA tydens
die debat oor die President se begrotingspos, is dit presies wat gaan
gebeur. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die Nuwe NP ondersteun hierdie begrotingspos van
die President. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Speaker, the speech made by the hon President during
the debate regarding the final report of the TRC was a very important
milestone on the road to reconciliation in South Africa, but reconciliation
is a process that cannot be achieved overnight and something which every
citizen should actively work towards making a reality. Politicians
specifically also have a responsibility to make reconciliation succeed. And
what we cannot afford is that in the run-on to the next election,
polarisation, however, is going to increase, instead of reconciliation
being made a reality. And unfortunately if one judges by the manner of the
DA during the debate about the President's Budget Vote, this is exactly
what is going to happen. [Interjections.] The New NP supports the
President's Budget Vote. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, the ANC
supports Budget Vote No 1, the Presidency. The key challenges facing South
African society are, firstly, to pursue economic growth, development and
redistribution in such a way as to improve the people's quality of life and
ensure that the frontiers of poverty are pushed back.

Secondly, it is to deepen democracy and the culture of human rights and
mobilise the people to take an active part in changing their lives for the
better. Thirdly, the key challenge is to transform the state machinery to
serve the cause of social change and ensure that the needs of the people
are put first. Fourthly, to ensure Africa's Renaissance and to build a new
world order.

The presidency under the leadership of Pres Thabo Mbeki has been at the
forefront of ensuring that all these challenges are addressed. The
presidency has done this by providing leadership, co-ordination of the
activities of Government, resulting in better planning, and service
delivery. Initiatives such as the urban renewal and integrated rural
development programmes are but some of the examples of this approach.

Through the work of the National Youth Commission, the Office on the Status
of Women and the Office on the Status of Disabled People, the presidency
has assisted in co-ordinating and focusing the work of Government as a
whole, and addresses the issues of particularly vulnerable sectors of our
society who were affected most by apartheid oppression. Through the imbizo
programme the presidency has assisted in bringing Government closer to the
people and emphasize the need of the people to play an active role in
improving their own lives.
The presidency has had a huge impact on the international terrain through
our country's positive contributions in Africa and abroad. These
interventions have contributed to the fight against poverty through seeking
to create peace and thus the possibility for economic growth. We support
this Vote and hope that this Appropriation Bill will further assist the
presidency in its quest to provide strategic leadership and ensure that
Government meets the needs of all our people and delivers on its commitment
to a better life for all. I thank you. [Applause.]

Vote accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 2 - Parliament - put and agreed to.

Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs - put and agreed to (National Action
dissenting).

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, on a point of order: The hon Ramodike's name is
indicated at his seat, but another member's name is on the voting machine.
Now he is afraid he is voting in another member's name. Can the table just
assure us whether Mr Ramodike's name is there or not? [Interjections.]
The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, we will establish what Mr Ramodike, as
distinct from the other member, wished to vote. If you would later on
indicate to the table. The vote will be corrected accordingly.

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr S PILLAY: Madam Speaker, we are going to vote in favour of the budget.
However, we emphasise the fact that we are not satisfied with the manner in
which this department is managed. It is one of the departments that will,
in future, enjoy the benefits of close scrutiny, not only by the New NP,
but of all responsible citizens of our country.

So disappointed were we that there was a serious and considerable
discussion about opposing this Budget Vote. We, therefore, call upon the
Minister to take very careful note of this declaration and to take
appropriate measures to deal with the vast problem that plagues this
department.

Undoubtedly, the Department of Home Affairs is one that everyone has a
vested interest in. Our interest is that it serves the purpose for which it
is intended. That is not happening. To list a few problems, there is a
chronic shortage of staff and an alarming exodus of trained and skilled
staff. Citizens have to wait for excessive periods to obtain enabling
documents. Others have waited since 1996, when they first applied. Some
have reached the age of 60 and they do not have enabling documents.

In a number of rural areas, there are no facilities to make applications.
One finds false IDs, passports and other documents are all over the
country. People that appear to commit these crimes cannot be apprehended,
for whatever reason. That is by the department's own confession. Thank you.

Ms N S MATHIBELA: Madam Speaker, the ANC supports the Budget Vote for Home
Affairs. We note with appreciation, the fact that the budget has been
increasing in real terms, over the last six years.

However, we also note the fact that the budget allocation is less than what
the department had requested from the National Treasury. This is a trend
across all the departments of Government. This is what the country can
generate in terms of revenue and has to be equitably distributed among the
competing priorities of our country.

We call upon all patriots to redouble their efforts in assisting the
Minister of Home Affairs, the Deputy Minister, the director-general and the
department in their effort to discharge efficient service to the South
African public.

Our common mission is to make South Africa a winning nation, and for this
to be realised, we should spare neither effort nor strength in making this
a reality. Thank you. [Applause.]

Vote No 4 agreed to.

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government - put.

Declarations of vote:
Mnr G A J GROBLER: Speaker, die DA steun nié die begrotingspos vir die
Departement vir Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die Minister en sommige van die personeel in sy departement bly in gebreke
om daadwerklik aandag aan plaaslike regering te gee. Die lang tye wat die
Minister buite die landsgrense bestee, dui ook op sy onverskillige houding
jeens sy pligte as Minister vir Provinsiale en Plaaslike Regering.

Eerstens is die Kommissie vir die Bevordering en Beskerming  van  die  Regte
van Kultuur-, Godsdiens- en Taalgemeenskappe nie binne  'n  aanvaarbare  tyd
in werking gestel nie.

Tweedens word daar nie behoorlike opleiding deur middel van Seta aan
munisipaliteite verskaf nie. Kundige bestuurslui ontbreek in die meeste
ANC/Nuwe NP-beheerde munisipaliteite as gevolg van die gebrekkige opleiding
en onoordeelkundige aanstellings, en lei daartoe dat munisipaliteite nie in
staat is om behoorlike invordering van hulle debiteure te doen nie.
Agterstallige skulde eskaleer daagliks en 'n bedrag van R24 miljard is
reeds aan munisipaliteite verskuldig, met die sentrale en provinsiale
regerings as die grootste wanbetalers teen 'n bedrag van ongeveer
R2 miljard.

Derdens is die Minister en sy departement nie in staat om beheer uit te
oefen oor die korrekte aanwending van fondse wat jaarliks deur die sentrale
Regering aan munisipaliteite toegeken word nie. Dit word weerspieël in die
gekwalifiseerde ouditverslae van meer as 70% van ons munisipaliteite.
Hierdie swak finansiële bestuur veroorsaak dat fondse aangewend word vir
ander doeleindes as wat die sentrale Regering - minister Manuel, jy gee dit
vir hulle - se bedoeling met die skenkings is, naamlik dat hierdie geld
aangewend moet word vir die armstes van die armes. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit
word nié gedoen nie. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr G A J GROBLER: Speaker, the DA does not support this Vote for the
Department of Provincial and Local Government. [Interjections.]

The Minister and some of the staff in his department are failing to give
active attention to local government. The long periods spent by the
Minister outside the borders of the country also indicate his indifferent
attitude towards his duties as Minister for Provincial and Local
Government.

Firstly, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of
Cultural, Religious and Language Communities was not implemented within an
acceptable time.

Secondly, no proper training is being provided to municipalities by means
of Seta. Experienced managerial staff are lacking in most ANC/New NP-
controlled municipalities as a result of the insufficient training and
injudicious appointments, and this results in municipalities not being able
to do proper collections from their debtors. Outstanding debts are
escalating daily and an amount of R24 billion is already owed to
municipalities, with the central and provincial governments as the largest
non-payers at an amount of approximately R2 billion.

Thirdly, the Minister and his department are not able to exercise control
over the correct utilisation of funds which are allocated to municipalities
by the central Government annually. This is reflected in the qualified
audit reports of more than 70% of our municipalities. This poor financial
management results in funds being utilised for purposes other than those
intended by the central Government - Minister Manuel, you give it to them -
namely that this money must be utilised for the poorest of the poor.
[Interjections.] This is not being done. Thank you.]

Mr P F SMITH: Madam Speaker, the IFP will be supporting this Vote, but we
do want to use this opportunity to indicate our unhappiness to the
Government and, of course, to the ANC as the ruling party, about the
position of local government in respect of the communal law areas of the
country.

I think it's important to state that we are, in fact, in agreement with
much of the system of local government itself. We understand the problems
facing local government and we appreciate that it's still a new system and
is still in its infancy. We understand this new legislation which, in all
likelihood, we will be supporting. The Minister of Finance's Management
Bill, for example, before us, and we understand that there's a ten to 15
year horizon before we can see the transformation of local government
through to its conclusion.

So, there's much we do agree with in the system of local government. Having
said that, I really want to stress that, as far as the communal law areas
are concerned, we believe that the system is failing the country and it's
failing our people. We believe, particularly, that Government has behaved
very badly in respect to this matter.

There has, quite frankly, been insufficient preparedness on behalf of
Government, to meet others half way in this matter. Traditional leaders,
for example, through their representative organisations, have expended much
effort in trying to meet Government half way in this matter. But we find
absolutely no reciprocity from Government in respect of the same thing.

Even worse, Government has led people by the nose, in respect of promises
that it really has had no intention, I think, of ever honouring. These
promises relate to both the content of local government system itself, as
well as to the process. Despite all that's been said over the last two
years, Government clearly has no intention of accommodating an alternative
approach towards local government in these areas. That indicates that we
really want to know why Government, in fact, makes the promises that it
does. It's very inappropriate.

Despite promising with monotonous regularity that these issues are going to
be put to bed, year after year, we are told that it's going to be finalised
within six months, by the end of the year, and each year that comes about,
the same position obtains. At the rate that we are going, by the time
elections come, this matter will still be outstanding, and we find this
completely unsatisfactory.

In conclusion, we believe that Government, in fact, has dealt with this
very, very important matter with contempt that it does not deserve. Thank
you.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, thank you, and I hope the Minister will
not try and detract focus, as he did the last time. He always has the last
say and he focused on traditional leaders, which is also one of the issues.

However, we are very emphatic about local government's equitable share, and
that goes to the Minister of Finance as well. I think, because local
government is the vehicle that is supposed to deliver on the developmental
mandate, it should definitely get the larger share of the pie.

Also looking at the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, it is important that
accurate stats are provided when the new formula is devised. At the moment,
we do know that local governments have insufficient fiscal bases, and that
most municipalities who collect their own revenues are dependent on
intergovernment transfers and definitely have a lack of financial
management capacity.

One of the many challenges that local government faces is that of financial
management. Although many programmes have been launched, provinces have yet
to present a workable strategy on how they will attend to improve the
financial management capacity of local government.

Also, we want to acknowledge, or rather caution, Government not to give
jobs for powers. I think that is where the problem is. They are putting
unskilled people in managerial positions and they are not able to
adequately come up with a financial plan.

Then there's the tension between councillors, managers and communities,
which is escalating, where it appears that finances follow political
parties which govern at particular municipalities. We have seen that, in
the city of Cape Town. It took them 12 months to come down to sort out the
issues in this particular area.

Let's just say that the ACDP will not be supporting this Budget Vote. Thank
you.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, the UCDP takes note that the Department of
Provincial and Local Government has a great responsibility to see to good
governance in the provincial and local spheres.

In the same breath, we appreciate the situation, but feel that there has to
be some quick mobility around the finalisation and putting in place of the
Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Rights of Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities.

Concomitant with this is the need for the resolution of the issue of powers
of traditional leaders. In the same breath, it is also important that
attention be given to cutting down on the amount of money being given to
the Municipal Demarcation Board, more so now that their mandate has been
completed, and the resources be given to some other areas.

Finally, the UCDP notes that, whilst the Presidential Task Team is busy
trying to find out what is going to happen to the people living in the so-
called cross boundary municipalities, these people live under very
uncertain periods. They are not sure whether they live in this or that
other province. However, we hope that this will be resolved quite speedily
and, in that breath, the UCDP will support the Vote.

Ms T E MILLEN: Madam Speaker, the IAM supports the official opposition ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, order!

Ms T E MILLEN: May I start again, Madam Speaker?

The SPEAKER: Yes, you may.

Ms T E MILLEN: The IAM supports the Official Opposition and the IFP and, in
particular, their concerns about the traditional leadership, on their
declarations of this Vote, and is deeply concerned at any sign of weakening
of provincial and local government. I thank you, Madam Speaker.
[Interjections.]

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, as the ANC, we believe that municipalities have
gone through a protracted, difficult and challenging transition period, and
we believe that, during this period, they have reached great strides in
ensuring that municipalities become centres of community life.

We believe that the core business of municipalities is the provision of
services to communities, and this will, no doubt, necessitate more
resources and support by different spheres of Government to municipalities.

This Budget Vote will, therefore, go a long way in assisting municipalities
to meet their constitutional obligations but, above all, in assisting us in
our endeavour of pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

We believe that the issue of traditional leadership finds more expression
in the new system of local government, wherein traditional leaders are
expected to participate in municipalities within their local areas. We also
believe that the equitable share has been used to address issues that are
associated with the provision of free and basic services, and this will, no
doubt, assist us in ensuring that we uplift the lives of ordinary people.
[Applause.]

Vote No 5 accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 6 - Public Works - put:

Declarations of vote:

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, the FA objects to supporting this Vote.
[Interjections.]

During the debate on the Budget Vote, we debated how the hon Minister
firstly failed to maintain the nation's buildings and properties entrusted
to her department; secondly, how she failed to draw up a policy document
that would allow her to maintain buildings and properties which her Cabinet
colleagues neglect to maintain; thirdly, she failed to respond to petitions
from the health departments of local authorities like Ekwetini to maintain
housing units in Durban; fourthly, she failed to ensure that one Military
Hospital in Pretoria not be closed for being considered a fire hazard; she
failed to ensure that local authorities are paid their rates and taxes by
various departments who are millions of rands in arrears; she failed to
ensure that some officials and members of Parliament who live in
parliamentary villages pay their rent on time and not sublet to people not
entitled to live in these villages, and she failed to give legitimate
reasons why a house in Port Elizabeth was sold way below market value to
the President's family.

In the old South Africa, Public Works was one of the best-run departments
in the administration. [Interjections.] Now, it seems that the ANC Minister
and nine MECs around the country must be trained and retrained to improve
their performance. [Interjections.] There are too many things going wrong
in this department, for which the Minister does not take responsibility.

The DA and the FA cannot support this budget whilst the Minister in charge
fails to maintain the nation's assets in a responsible way.

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, are you rising on a point of order?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Yes, Madam Speaker. Is the hon member allowed to
mislead the House in that way? [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: May I say that all of you do, but it's deliberate misleading
that is ... [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: That's deliberate! That's deliberate. [Applause.]
[Interjections.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance, Federal Alliance and Independent
African Movement dissenting.)

Vote No 7 - Government Communication and Information System - put and
agreed to (Democratic Alliance, Federal Alliance and Independent African
Movement dissenting).

Vote No 8 - National Treasury - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms R TALJAARD: [Interjections.] Calm down, Minister Manuel.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order!

Ms R TALJAARD: There is no doubt that the work of the National Treasury
represents the lifeblood of the South African economy. There is no doubt
that under the Gear policy, South Africa has earned credibility for fiscal
rectitude and broad macroeconomic policy.
This in itself warrants support for this Budget Vote. It is clear that the
ongoing crucial challenge now emanates from faster social delivery. If only
other Ministeries were able to deliver social change of the calibre of the
macroeconomic stability delivered by National Treasury.

As the declarations here will show today, this is not the case in  too  many
departments. It is impossible to  adequately  differentiate  among  all  the
responsible divisions within the National Treasury and between the array  of
public entities reporting  to  the  Minister  of  Finance  in  a  two-minute
declaration and do them justice.

Separate declarations are desirable if oversight is  to  mean  anything.  In
addition, the  time  has  come  to  sever  the  National  Treasury  and  the
Intelligence Votes in order to enable parties in this House to take a  clear
position on the  Intelligence  Vote  itself.  The  current  dispensation  is
highly undesirable and has to be resolved without delay.

The DA would like to congratulate the Minister of Finance and the  officials
concerned on South Africa's recent financial action task  force  compliance.
There is little doubt that one cannot stand  outside  the  financial  action
task force's requirements and  actively  combat  terrorism,  moneylaundering
and continue to be an attractive FDI destination.

However, the DA would like to use this opportunity to express its concern
that the National Treasury appears to have made a decision to adopt the
model of a single financial regulator for South Africa's financial services
sector without sufficient public debate on this matter or consultation with
the SA Reserve Bank. This matter is of great importance and significance.

Caution and circumspection must remain watchwords in any policy choice made
by this Government. The financial services sector literally cannot afford
any ill-conceived experiments.

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, the ANC rises in support of the Budget Vote
for National Treasury for the year 2003-04.

As the previous speaker has said, seldom has this economy ever been in more
capable hands than it is under an ANC Government. [Applause.]

The many, many achievements of this National Treasury are difficult to
enumerate in this small space of two minutes. Let me say that the spirited,
energetic and purposeful way in which it has gone about the task of
overhauling the macroeconomic management of this country, our taxation
system, of totally transforming the manner in which revenue is collected,
and implementing a smooth and efficient running of our intergovernmental
fiscal system are achievements that few governments have ever been able to
reach.

I want to say in connection with the single financial regulator issue that,
yes, there is a concern. It seems there has been a hiatus in the
development. That certainly does not mean that financial regulation has not
received the ongoing attention of this department. We only need to look at
the comprehensive legislation relating to consumer protection; the
implementation of the pension surpluses and the apportionment to people who
previously were not entitled to it; the overhaul of the long-term and short-
term insurance industry; the modernisation of our stock exchanges, and the
complete overhaul of our unit-trust industry are but a few of the issues
related to financial regulation which this department has championed.

The ANC would like to congratulate National Treasury, the Minister, the
Deputy Minister and the DG for the sterling work that they have performed
for this country. [Applause.]

Vote No 8 agreed to.

Vote No 9 - Public Enterprises - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr J L THERON: The DA will oppose this Budget Vote. The DA wants to
congratulate Telkom on their listing on stock exchanges. To quote Rudi
Heine's last speech:


  For the first time since the ANC became the Government, a public listing
  of a parastatal was taking place. But surely, in the current economic
  climate, this is not enough for all public enterprises.

South Africa's privatisation programme has been a disaster. Unnecessary
delays, continual ambivalence, infighting within the tripartite alliance
and excessive conditionality costs South Africa dearly.

The DA must mention the following very unpleasant experiences regarding
public enterprises. First, Transnet production/privatisation tender awarded
to Skotaville Press with damages R57 million awarded by the High Court to
the unsuccessful bidder. Two, donations by parastatals to the ANC network
lounge amounting to between R70 and R140 000 per parastatal. This matter
has been referred to the Auditor-General for investigation. Third, Eskom
lost R127 million in a foreign exchange deal because the procurement
department did not follow the required procedures. Four, the investment in
mounting communications to the amount of R46 million and the non-disclosure
of all the investment transactions, and in particular a guarantee that gave
rise to a contingent liability for Eskom of R424 million is absolutely
shocking. Five, the announcement that Spoornet needs a recapitalisation
programme of R19 billion. Is it not bad management that this disaster is
being acted upon only now? The tragedy of Transnet pension funds, where
urgent recapitalisation is necessary. At least 45 000 pensioners and
Transnet employees are suffering because of the grave consequences of this.

The DA will oppose this Budget Vote.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mevrou die Speaker, agterstallige dienstegelde is al
verskeie kere deur die VF uitgelig as die groot oorsaak van bankrotskappe
en finansiële probleme in plaaslike regering. Maar as ons kom by openbare
ondernemings, en ons gaan kyk na Eskom, sien ons dat Eskom letterlik
miljoene rande afskryf as gevolg van die niebetaling van
elektrisiteitsrekenings.

Die VF sê dis onbillik dat daar by sommige plekke 'n afskrywing kan wees,
maar by ander plekke nie. Dit is reeds bekend dat daar 'n basiese
hoeveelheid krag kosteloos gelewer kan word aan mense wat dit nie kan
bekostig nie. 'n Mens kan nie belastingbetalersgeld op sentrale vlak vat om
mense op grondvlak te finansier wat nie betaal nie en dit terwyl hulle wel
kan betaal. Daarom sê die VF dit is onbillik dat betalers van dienstegelde
moet opdok vir die niebetalers wat nooit betaal nie, en daarom sal die VF
nie hierdie pos steun nie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, arrear service fees has been highlighted
several times in the past by the FF as the major cause of bankruptcies and
financial problems in local government. But when it comes to public
enterprises, and we look at Eskom, we see that Eskom writes off literally
millions of rands as a result of nonpayment of electricity accounts.

The FF says it is unfair that at some places there can be write-offs, but
not at others. It is already known that a basic amount of electricity may
be supplied free of charge to people who cannot afford it. One cannot take
taxpayers' money at central level to finance people at grassroots level who
do not pay while they can in fact pay. For this reason the FF says it is
unfair that people who pay service fees must shoulder the burden for
nonpayers who never pay, and for this reason the FF will not be supporting
this Vote.]

Mr B A D MARTINS: Madam Speaker, the Department of Public Enterprises has
faced many challenges, but in the history of this country, it has done
exceedingly well with regard to the restructuring of all state enterprises.

Under the conditions with the requisite challenges, the department could
not have done better and continues to face and address these challenges.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance and Freedom Front dissenting).

Vote No 10 - Public Service and Administration - put and agreed to.

Vote No 11 - Public Service Commission - put and agreed to.

Vote No 12 - South African Management Development Institute - put and
agreed to.

Vote no 13 - Statistics South Africa - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms R TALJAARD: Madam Speaker, in recent weeks Stats SA have grabbed the
headlines for the wrong reason. Due largely to resource constraints, amidst
great demand for statistics, the agency made the wrong judgement call in
discontinuing the crucial October Household Survey and that caused
distortions in the crucial CPIX. While the CPIX figures have been revised
downwards and the monetary policy adjusted accordingly, concerns persist.

Wages and utility tariffs have been distorted by incorrect data. Hundreds
of home owners have paid more for their bonds. Individuals and co-
operatives have incurred higher financing costs. Wage negotiations were
concluded on the basis of incorrect figures. Tariff hikes by Eskom, Telkom,
the Post Office and Spoornet were based on faulty data and are not being
readjusted or revisited. The recent eurobond issue regarding the National
Treasury might result in liabilities for the Government. Why is no one
being held accountable? In addition, due to the long delays in the release
of Census 2001 data, there is every reason to be concerned and to ask
whether those most desperately in need of delivery are in fact receiving it
in terms of grants or infrastructural development in provinces with the
backlogs.

Minister, where are the Census 2001 results? The fact is that the delivery
is taking place based on clearly outdated population and household data.
Not only is the pace of delivery slow but we can rightly ask whether those
most in need of delivery are in actual fact receiving it, as Stats SA are
clearly underresourced, based purely on the wide range of demands placed on
this agency to roll out a national statistic system. We cannot support a
Budget Vote that inadequately provides for the vast funding needs of the
national statistics system.

Mnr A BLAAS: Speaker, die ACDP is nie oortuig daarvan dat die
bestuursvermoë van Statistiek SA aan die nodige vereistes voldoen nie. Dit
word weerspieël in die onlangse probleem wat ons gehad het met die
vrystelling van statistiek wat dramatiese impak het op ons ekonomie en die
hele bedryf van kontrakte en dies meer. Hierdie standpunt word ook gesteun
deur die feit dat daar ook in die departement self verskille is oor die
prestasievermoë van hierdie departement. Gevolglik sal die ACDP nie hierdie
begrotingspos steun nie. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Speaker, the ACDP is not convinced that the management
capacity of Statistics SA meets the necessary requirements. This is
reflected in the recent problem we had in releasing of statistics, which
had a dramatic impact on our economy and the whole industry of contracts
and so forth. This point of view is also supported by the fact that in the
department itself there is disagreement about the performance capacity of
this department. Consequently, the ACDP will not support this Budget Vote.
Thank you.]

Ms T E MILLEN: Madam Speaker ... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon members!

Ms T E MILLEN: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I would just say that I fully
support the DA's position on this. [Interjections.] The debacle on
statistics is enough to really put the whole thing to bed. And if I do
support the DA, gee whiz, I think I can live with that! Thank you.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon members! Order! [Interjections.]

Ms S B NQODI: Madam Speaker, the ANC supports Budget Vote 13 on Statistics
SA. When I look back at the period of about 9 years that members of this
House have spent in this democratically elected Parliament, I want to
believe that the experience, skills and expertise that we have gained
really make all of us seasoned and sober-minded politicians in the way in
which we assess, interpret or approach and debate issues.

The magnitude and importance of the work done by Statistics SA should never
be underestimated, not to mention the challenges it faces. The decisions
that we make in all the policies that we formulate must be informed by the
realities of conditions on the ground under which our public or civil
servants work.

Statistical data provided to us by Statistics SA afford us, politicians and
Government, with that gauge or barometer of measuring our performance when
it comes to service delivery. It helps us in targeting those that are
really in need, namely the rural poor black people or communities. It
allows us to monitor, evaluate and possibly review some of our policies and
programmes if need be, hence the ANC's unequivocal acknowledgement of the
miscalculations of the CPIX, which we deeply regret. We have said that.

The budget allocation of Statistics SA has intranational importance because
the Government as a whole utilises statistical data prepared by Statistics
SA. Furthermore, our own social partners in business and labour also
utilise that same data to keep our economy on a growth trajectory.
Statistics SA is currently on its way to becoming a quality statistical
knowledge centre in statistical production. Therefore, the resource
envelope allocated to it will probably alleviate the awesome burden of
backlogs that we have inherited. This is a far cry from an apartheid past
when there were no reliable official statistics. The ANC supports the Vote.
[Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance, African Christian Democratic Party,
Federal Alliance and Independent African Movement dissenting).

Vote No 14 - Arts and Culture - put:

Declarations of vote:

Mnr S E OPPERMAN: Speaker, die DA steun die begrotingspos, alhoewel ons
baie bekommerd is oor die gebrek aan verantwoordbare finansiële bestuur by
instellings soos die Robbeneiland-museum, en versoek dat nuwe bewerings van
ongerymdhede by onder meer Windybrow in Johannesburg dringend ondersoek
word. Die verslegtende verhouding tussen die departement en sekere
kultuurorganisasies is ook onaanvaarbaar.

Die DA verwelkom die voorgestelde taalwetgewing wat gelykberegtiging aan al
11 amptelike tale waarborg. Dit is belangrik dat die wetgewing deur alle
staatsdepartemente toegepas sal word sonder om skuiwergate te soek om die
gees daarvan te ondermyn.

Vertalingfasiliteite moet dringend uitgebrei word om nie net meer tale te
akkommodeer nie, maar ook om aan besoekers in die galery die geleentheid te
bied om alle debatte te volg. Die nasionale Parlement moet deur die
voorbeeld wat ons stel, demonstreer dat veeltaligheid ons erns is. Elke
komponent van ons taaldiversiteit moet beskerm en uitgebrei word, anders
word ons amptelike leuse, ``eenheid in diversiteit,'' 'n belaglikheid. Ek
dank u. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN: Speaker, the DA supports the Budget Vote, although we are
very concerned about the lack of accountable financial management at
institutions such as the Robben Island Museum, and requests that new
allegations of irregularities at, among others, Windybrow in Johannesburg
should urgently be investigated. The deteriorating relationship between the
department and certain cultural organisations is also unacceptable.

The DA welcomes the proposed language legislation that guarantees equal
empowerment to all 11 official languages. It is important that the
legislation is applied throughout all government departments without
searching for loopholes to undermine the spirit of it.

Translation facilities must be urgently expanded; not only to accommodate
more languages, but also to give visitors in the gallery the opportunity to
follow all debates. The national Parliament must, through the example that
we are setting, demonstrate that multilingualism is our serious concern.
Each component of our language diversity must be protected and expanded,
otherwise our official motto, ``unity in diversity'' is made ludicrous. I
thank you. [Interjections.]]

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Chairperson, the ANC supports Vote No 14 on Arts and
Culture. The creation of a separate Department of Arts and Culture has led
to more resources being allocated to arts, culture and languages. All the
programmes that formerly shared resources with science and technology now
have a better allocation. There is now opportunity for better focus, and, I
want to emphasise, particularly on the arts and languages and, therefore,
hopefully there will be better performance in future.

The Department of Arts and Culture recently held a consultative conference
on multilingualism. It was a very, very successful conference. What we are
looking forward to now is a Bill that will come to Parliament: the South
African Languages Bill. Therefore there is no need to panic. The department
is up and coming. There is a new director-general and we hope for better
performance, as I have already said. Thank you. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 15 - Education - put.

Declarations of vote:
Mnr W P DOMAN: Voorsitter, die DA is tevrede dat die toegang van alle
leerders tot onderwys nagestreef word en dat die maksimum begroting aan die
onderwys toegeken is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Chairperson, the DA is satisfied that access to education
for all learners is the aspiration and that education has been allocated
the maximum budget.]

However, the mere spending of additional amounts of public money without
improvement on learning outcomes, retention rates and pass rates is no
indicator of success. Without hard roll-out plans and proper costing, the
recent action plan is little more than the carefully timed release of a
list of election promises which the Minister, in his own words, said will
only be phased in in the next financial year.

Earlier this month, the Minister released his systemic evaluation report on
the foundation phase. It concedes that the poor performance of learners,
particularly in numeracy and literacy, is a cause for concern. The truth is
that the majority of the Grade 3 learners have been victims of bad teaching
within a poorly implemented Curriculum 2005. This alone would be
justification to vote against the budget.

Nog 'n rede is egter dat 60% van leerders die skool verlaat sonder matriek,
en gekoppel hieraan is die afname in matrikulante en
universiteitsvrystellings. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[However, another reason is the fact that 60% of learners leave school
without matric, and coupled with this is the decrease in matriculants and
university exemptions.]

The Minister and his department have failed to have the curriculum for
further education and training ready in time. Not only do learners who
complete Grade 9 have to go back to an outdated curriculum in Grade 10 but,
once again, no parents of learners in Grade 9 know what the criteria are
for promotion at the end of this year.

'n Derde rede waarom die DA teen die begrotingspos stem, is omdat die ANC-
regering die bevoegdhede van beheerliggame inperk deur in te meng met hulle
aanstellingsbevoegdheid, met hulle inisiatiewe om deur ekstra vergoeding
onderwysers te behou en te motiveer, en met hulle reg om
godsdiensbeoefening te reël. Ten slotte is dit lofwaardig dat die agb
Minister met die plan gekom het om die hoëronderwysinstellings van 36 na 21
te verminder, maar ons hoor niks omtrent die kwantifisering van die poste
nie ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[A third reason why the DA is voting against this Budget Vote, is because
the ANC Government limits the powers of governing bodies by interfering
with their power to make appointments, with their initiatives to maintain
and motivate educators through additional remuneration, and with their
right to regulate religious practice. Finally, it is laudable that the hon
Minister formulated a plan to reduce institutions for higher education from
36 to 21, but we do not hear anything about the quantification of posts
...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr W P DOMAN: ... en daarom kan ons, ten spyte van die Minister se ywer,
nie die begrotingspos steun nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [... and therefore we
cannot, despite the Minister's diligence, support the Budget Vote.
[Interjections.]]

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Chairperson, the New NP once again calls on the Minister
of Education not to introduce the so-called new measures in education
unless they have been thoroughly thought through and unless the suggestion
had been through a decent process of consultation with stakeholders,
including parents, and not only with his officials. We are not against
reform but only after thorough research must it be introduced.

The education system has been through a very unstable time in the past few
years and we owe it to everybody involved to now operate in a more stable
climate. However, we acknowledge that this is a very difficult and varied
portfolio and we thank the Minister for his enthusiasm in doing this very
difficult job. The New NP will support the Budget Vote. [Interjections.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, werkloosheid is waarskynlik op hierdie
oomblik Suid-Afrika se grootste probleem. Een van die belangrikste wyses om
dit op te los is 'n goeie onderwysstelsel wat produkte lewer wat die
probleme van werkloosheid kan oplos. As eerste stap moet ons in Suid-Afrika
daarin slaag om alle kinders op skool te kry. Ons het nog nie daarin
geslaag nie. Daarná moet ons daarin slaag om basiese onderwys aan almal te
gee.

Afrikaners het in die ou dae spottenderwys in Engels gesê onderwys moet aan
kinders die drie R'e gee: ``reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic''. Ons huidige
onderwysdepartement, sê ek, is te besig om allerlei tierlantyntjies in die
onderwys in te bring en daarom mis hulle hierdie basiese goed wat kan help
dat ons van onder af kan opbou. Daarná kan 'n mens die luukses van
tierlantyntjies begin invoer.

Verder verskil ons van die Minister se benadering dat hy aan skole en
universiteite op alle vlakke wil voorskryf. Dit geld vir kurrikula,
godsdiens op skool, asook die huidige samesmelting van universiteite wat
steeds meer druk op Afrikaans as onderrigtaal op universiteit plaas. Die VF
sal daarteen stem. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr P W A Mulder: Mr Chairman, unemployment is probably South Africa's
biggest problem at this moment. One of the most important ways to solve it
would be a good educational system, which will deliver products who would
be able to solve the problems of unemployment. As a first step, we in South
Africa must succeed in getting all children to attend school. We have not
managed to do that yet. Then, we must succeed in giving basic education to
all.
Afrikaners, in the old days jokingly said that we must give our children
the three R's: ``reading, 'riting and 'rithmetic''. Our current Education
Department, I would say, is too busy to import all kinds of frills to
education and therefore they miss all these basic things which could help
us build from afresh. Only then can one start to import the frills.

Furthermore, we disagree with the Minister's approach of wanting to
prescribe to schools and universities on all levels. This includes
curricula, religion in schools, as well as the current merging of
universities, which put more pressure on Afrikaans as medium of
instruction. The FF will vote against it.]

Ms T E MILLEN: Mr Chairperson, the IAM opposes interference in religious
matters in our public schools. When you get the situation that the
mainstream religious groups - Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Jewish religions
- are all agreed in opposing such interference, surely, hon Minister, a
message must be getting through to the powers that be. [Interjections.]

The IAM also opposes obstructing schools from funding their own additional
teachers and opposes all attempts to reduce education to the lowest common
denominator. [Interjections.] We will not be supporting this Vote. Thank
you. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon members!

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, the NA appreciates the assurance that the hon
Minister gave me with regard to religion in education when he said, ``We
have met all your concerns''. But, although I would like to believe that
the Minister subjectively spoke the truth, I have doubts whether the
Minister and I are at one with regard to the extent and content of our
concerns. We are not happy with this interference in the religious
character of education.

Dan is ons ook ongelukkig met die praktyk dat daar toegelaat word dat mense
met hulle voete stem om die taalbeleid van skole te verander en dat die
beheerliggaam nie kan besluit wat die taalbeleid is en daarvolgens kinders
kan toelaat nie. Die omgekeerde gebeur. Ons kry eintlik ``bussing'' -
kinders word aangery en dan word die skool gedwing om die taalbeleid te
verander sodat net 15% van die skole wat Afrikaans was nou nog steeds
Afrikaansmedium is.

Dan het ons 'n groot probleem met die inmenging in die tersiêre vlak van
onderrig. Die PUK se naam het in die slag gebly. Ons gee nie om oor die
``Potchefstroom'' nie, maar ons gee om oor die ``CHO''. Honderd en vyftig
jaar se geskiedenis is met een besluit 'n streep deurgetrek, en as 'n mens
met die mense praat, sê hulle hulle het nie 'n keuse gehad nie, want die
skaakmeester van bo het die pionne geskuif. Die NA gaan definitief teen die
onderwysbeleid stem. Dankie. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Then we are also dissatisfied with the practice that people are allowed to
vote by means of protest marches to change the language policy of schools
and that the controlling body cannot decide on the language policy and
admit children accordingly. The opposite happens. We actually get
``bussing'' - children are conveyed to a school and then the school is
forced to change the language policy so that only 15% of the schools which
used to be Afrikaans are now still Afrikaans medium.

Then we have an enormous problem with the interference on the tertiary
level of education. The PUK's name has fallen a victim to this. We do not
mind about the ``Potchefstroom'', but we mind about the ``CHO''. One
hundred and fifty years' history has been nullified by one decision, and if
one talks to people, they say that they had no choice because the chess
master at the top shifted the pawns. The NA is definitely going to vote
against the education policy. Thank you. [Interjections.]]

Prof S M MAYATULA: Hon Chair, the ANC supports this Budget Vote. Through
this budget, the ANC-led Government is committed and determined to
transform the educational system of this country to benefit all our people,
black and white; especially the poorest of the poor.

The religion in education document, which was well explained by the
department in our committee meeting - unfortunately the member of the IAM
was not there - and which is now out for public comment, is meant to
encourage acceptance of different religions in our schools. As a rainbow
nation, let us embrace each other. Let us live together despite our
differences. Let us not be tempted to use our Christian majority. The
members who were present in the portfolio committee meeting did accept that
some of the misconceptions in the press were just that.

The proposed funding formula for schools, which is equitable in its
approach, will have a dramatic impact on the funding of nonpersonnel items
of the poorest schools in our country. This shows that the tide has turned.
The people of the Northern Cape, both black and white, were all smiles when
their national institute for higher education was inaugurated over the past
weekend. This is an indication that, surely, the tide has turned.

The Jacob Zuma Trust is reaching out to the forgotten children of our
country to restore their pride and human dignity. That is transformation at
its best. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The schedule does not list the IFP
but I have recognised them. Will you please make your declaration.

Mr M A MPONTSHANE: Hon Chairperson, the IFP supports Vote No 15. However,
the transfer of funds, especially the R5 million which has been transferred
to the Jacob Zuma Trust Fund, remains a source of concern to us. The fact
that the recipients of bursaries from this trust fund are those who have
been identified by the TRC process makes it even more suspicious and
unequitable.

The IFP has suffered many distortions, including distortions by the TRC.
The IFP lost many of its followers and leaders through perpetrators who
have been given amnesty by the TRC process. The awarding of these bursaries
would exclude those whom the TRC has wrongfully labelled as villains. This
process should be open to all political parties if we do not want to
perpetuate these distortions. I thank you.

Vote No 15 accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 16 - Health - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr M WATERS: Chair, South Africa is fast becoming known as the killing
fields with hundreds of thousands of people already dying from Aids-related
diseases. The graveyards are becoming filled to capacity and the mortuaries
are overflowing with dead bodies.

Through the ANC Government's narrow-minded and outdated stance on HIV/Aids,
we are creating a nation of orphans which this Government cannot look after
- 500 000 of them, to be precise. Research has shown conclusively that it
is cheaper in the long run to provide antiretroviral treatment for HIV
sufferers than to allow people to die. Instead of tackling the problem, the
Government continues only to treat opportunistic infections, thus
sentencing HIV-positive people to a certain early death.

The Government is also the single biggest employer of over one million
people. The Aids disaster is taking its toll on the Public Service with the
department's own report saying that without treatment service delivery will
suffer as 250 000 public servants would have died from Aids by 2012.

The hon Minister Fraser-Moleketi's report further stated that skilled and
highly skilled employees are at the highest risk of infection. The current
HIV-infection level in the Public Service is 14%, but higher in key areas.
The rate amongst student nurses is 30%, teachers 18%, social workers 19%
and the defence force 22% - from your own report, hon Minister.

This is the first year when Aids-related deaths in the Public Service will
outnumber non-Aids deaths. The DA, along with every sane South African, is
saying that we must start a national antiretroviral treatment campaign,
because we cannot as human beings tolerate 600 deaths per day to Aids.

I am today speaking on behalf of the five million infected people in my
country, the 500 000 orphans and the millions of South Africans who are
gobsmacked at the ANC's stance on HIV. The DA cannot in all conscience
support the health budget. I thank you. [Interjections.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, the IFP is not satisfied with the standard of
health care in public services and even less satisfied with services in
rural areas. We oppose the move to centralise control over all aspects of
health policy. The IFP advocates greater decentralisation and clarity in
health policy and a bottom-up approach.

We advocate greater autonomy and funding, and point out that the worst
aspect of duplication in bureaucracy is in conditional grants, which
constitute 20% of health spend in provinces and are difficult to use.

The IFP wants to see more use of incentives and competitive public-private
partnerships to bridge the gap between levels of care in public and private
institutions.

As regards HIV/Aids, the IFP does not support the secrecy and anonymity
informing much of Government's policies. We advocate more testing and the
need for people to know their status. We advocate stronger censorship when
people knowingly or willingly infect their sex partners with HIV. Unlike
Government's desire to give no one what cannot be given to everyone, the
IFP advocates an incremental approach to providing nevirapine to pregnant
mothers and antiretroviral treatment to people with HIV or Aids.

There should be better use of partnerships between donors, civil society
and Government until all people who need it receive the medicine they need.
The IFP abhors the Minister of Health's failure to allow KwaZulu-Natal to
use the 73 million dollars donated to the Enhancing Care Initiative by the
Global Fund. The NGO awarded this money by the fund was none other than the
Nelson Mandela School of Medicine. It was judged to have submitted the best
proposal that the fund has received. The money would be distributed through
a reputable and tightly audited chain of care givers. The Global Fund has
declared the money ready to be transferred and the health ministry has
proved its capacity to distribute millions of dollars in donor funding.

This political obstruction of funding for orphans, mothers, Aids sufferers
and the population at large is a dereliction of duty. [Interjections.]
Thank you.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, die MIV/Vigs-pandemie is die grootste
gesondheidskrisis wat Suid-Afrika moet hanteer sedert die 1918-
griepepidemie.

Die toekoms sal wys dat dit die ergste is wat ons nog ooit gehad het.
Nieteenstaande baie debatte in hierdie Raad oor die Regering se beleid ten
opsigte van hierdie sake, is hy steeds onduidelik en steeds verwarrend.
Daarom gaan die VF teen hierdie begrotingspos stem.

Elke Suid-Afrikaanse dokter nog wat die land verlaat, is 'n ontelbare
verlies vir Suid-Afrika. Die departement slaag nie daarin om selfs, na nege
jaar, toestande in hospitale en in die gesondheidsomgewing te skep wat Suid-
Afrikaanse dokters aanmoedig om nie die land te verlaat nie en wel hier aan
te bly. Ons kan nie toelaat dat dit so tot ons eie nadeel voortgaan nie.
Die VF sal teen die begrotingspos stem. (Translation of Afrikaans speech
follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, the HIV/Aids pandemic is the largest health
crisis with which South Africa has had to deal since the influenza epidemic
of 1918.

The future will show that it was the worst we have ever experienced.
Despite many debates in this House on the Government's policy with regard
to these issues, it is still unclear and still confusing. That is why the
FF will vote against this Budget Vote.

Each and every South African doctor who leaves the country is an
incalculable loss to South Africa. Even after nine years, the department is
not able to create conditions in hospitals and in the health environment
which would encourage South African doctors not to leave the country, but
rather remain here. We cannot allow this to continue to our own
disadvantage. The FF will vote against the Budget Vote.]

Ms T E MILLEN: Thank you, Chairperson. The IAM fully supports the position
of the DA in opposing this Vote. [Interjections.]

And I cannot add anything further to the comments made by the hon Ruth
Rabinowitz about the UN Global Fund and the Minister's attitude. It's just
a pity that the IFP is not also voting against this Vote. Thank you.
[Interjections.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, may I ask my benchmate rather to say we are
against the Vote than to say we support the DA. It sounds much better.
[Laughter.]

The NA will vote against the Health Budget.

Ons sien die Regering se vigsbeleid is nog steeds vol en deurtrek van
dissidente se standpunte, wat die land na 'n ramp gaan lei. Die traagheid
om antiretrovirale middels vrylik beskikbaar te stel ten spyte van 'n
hofbevel, moet veroordeel word. En dan is dit ook so dat die Regering se
vigsbeleid CCC is - ``condomise, condomise, condomise.'' (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We notice that the Government's Aids policy is still riddled with
dissidents' viewpoints, which is going to lead the country to disaster. The
reluctance to make antiretrovirals freely available, in spite of a court
order, must be condemned. And then it is also true that the Government's
Aids policy is CCC - condomise, condomise, condomise.]

And not ABC - abstinence, be faithful and condomise.

Die toestande in staatshospitale is veral skrikwekkend. Gaan kyk net in
vanoggend se Beeld waar vertel word van 'n 84-jarige dame wat gesond in 'n
hospitaal ingegaan het en siek daar uitgekom het. Die NA kan nie hierdie
begrotingspos steun nie. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[The conditions in state hospitals are especially alarming. Just have a
look at this morning's Beeld, in which there is an article about an 84-year-
old lady who was healthy when she entered the hospital, and ill when she
left it. The NA cannot support this Budget Vote. I thank you.]
Mr L V J NGCULU: Chairperson, as the ANC we stand in full and unequivocal
support of this budget. We do so confident of the route we have travelled
in the field of health; confident that since 1994 many achievements have
been made in this field. Ours does not begin and end with HIV/Aids.

We look at health in a comprehensive and deeper manner. We are aware that
in the budget of HIV/Aids in this current Budget, 32% has been allocated
for HIV/Aids, which is something that we should all appreciate. An amount
of R500 million have been allocated for retention and recruitment of staff,
especially in the rural areas, for serious programmes and more allocation
to conditional grants for hospital revitalisation programmes. These are the
achievements that make us proud to say today that we support this Budget.

Those of us who have a microscope and are looking only from one area,
especially those who think perhaps HIV/Aids is going to be their own
rallying call in the elections, will be found wanting when we come to the
elections in 2004. [Interjections.] Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Vote No 16 accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 17 - Labour - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Chairperson, the DA will not be supporting this Vote.

The department states that its aim is to, and I quote:


  ... play a significant role in reducing unemployment, poverty and
  inequality through a set of policies and programmes developed in
  consultation with roleplayers aimed at improved economic efficiency,
  productivity, skills development and employment creation, sound labour
  relations, eliminating inequality and discrimination in the workplace,
  alleviating poverty as well as unemployment, and the protection and
  enhancement of worker rights and benefits is also part of the aim.

As far as its intended aim of reducing unemployment, this department has
failed dismally. Since 1994, approximately one million jobs have been lost
on their watch. The department has seen increasing unemployment, which now
stands at approximately 7,6 million and close to 40% of the economically
active population. It seems they have no strategy in place to reduce our
unemployment levels. The consequence is that poverty and inequality is
increasing day by day.

This department is not fulfilling its core mandate. It is a serious
indictment on the department and the Minister.

The DA believes that skills development should enjoy very high priority.
The co-ordination of the Sector Education Training Authority, Seta, is
supposed to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of the Skills
Development Strategy at sector level. There is overwhelming evidence that
Setas are not working and should be scrapped. They have become self-serving
with exorbitant salaries, equally big egos and with little or no delivery.
The Setas are accumulating huge bank balances with no capacity to
distribute the money to perform their core function. I thank you.

Ms T E MILLEN: Chairperson, this time I will just say that I will not be
supporting this Vote and I support the call for the division that will be
coming. I do not agree with the labour laws at all. The sooner they go, the
sooner we will have people employed. Thank you.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, I am against this Vote as well. [Laughter.]

As ons reeds 'n werkloosheidsyfer van 40% het, Meneer, hoe kan ons sê dat
die Departement van Arbeid in sy doel slaag; veral as dié syfer steeds
styg? Verder is dit so dat arbeidswetgewing ontwikkeling strem. Daar word
voortdurend daarop gewys. Die President het daarop in sy heel eerste
openingsrede gewys en daardie wetgewing word nie aangespreek nie.

Die rigiditeit van die departement ten opsigte van die stelsel van
minimumlone bring verdere werkloosheid mee. Dis nie ek wat so sê nie, dis
die Premier van die Noordelike Provinsie, mnr Ramatlhodi, wat dit sê.

Wat betref die kwessie van regstellende aksie, verlaat van ons beste
mensemateriaal die land. Die NA kan nie hierdie departement se begroting
steun nie. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[If we already have an unemployment figure of 40%, Sir, how can we say that
the Department of Labour achieves its goal; especially if this figure keeps
rising? Furthermore, it is so that labour legislation hampers development.
This is constantly being pointed out. The President indicated this in his
very first state of the nation address, and that legislation is not being
addressed.

The rigidity of the department regarding the system of minimum wages causes
further increases in unemployment. It is not I who says so, it is the
Premier of the Northern Province, Mr Ramatlhodi, who says that.

Regarding the issue of employment equity, our best human material is
leaving the country. The NA cannot support this department's budget. I
thank you.]

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, the Labour Vote that some parties are voting
against today is about a Vote that has dealt with some of the most
discriminatory laws and practices in our country.

Addressing the effect of the old apartheid laws forms the core of the work
of the Department of Labour. So when parties vote against this Vote, they
vote against eradicating discrimination in the workplace. [Interjections.]
They vote against raising the skills level in the labour market. They vote
against giving domestic workers and farmworkers better working conditions.
[Applause.]

What do they, who vote against this Vote, want? [Interjections.] Do they
want the top jobs in the country to still be filled by white males?
[Interjections.] Do they want black people to remain unskilled and only
doing manual labour? Do they want domestic workers and farmworkers to still
be paid and treated like slaves? If this is so, then what they want is
apartheid. [Interjections.]

We all know what the DA's policy about fight-back is about. It is to fight
blacks improving their lives and to retain white privilege. This is racist
and yet they accuse us of playing the racist card. [Interjections.] They
don't care about finding solutions to the problems of South Africa. They
are more obsessed with what is happening in Zimbabwe. We support this Vote
for a better life for all. Viva ANC, Viva ! [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Vote No 17 accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 18 - Science and Technology - put and agreed to.

Vote No 19 - Social Development - put.

Declarations of vote:
Mrs G M BORMAN: Chairperson, the DA will be supporting this budget.
[Interjections.] We welcome the increases to the grants. We also welcome
the extension of the Child Support Grant, but we want to see that extended
immediately to children up to fourteen years old. When the President
announced that this would be extended progressively, he actually caused
tremendous confusion out there.

The DA will again urge the Minister to introduce the Basic Income Grant.
The submissions made at the Taylor Report hearings were overwhelmingly in
favour, and researchers who began their research opposed to the BIG
finished up saying that this was the only way to go. It's the ANC-led
Government that is standing in the way of the Basic Income Grant.
[Interjections.]

Last Friday morning the first news bulletin on SAfm carried the news that
500 pensioners had not been paid in the Eastern Cape. On Sunday we read in
the Sunday Times of IDs being issued incorrectly again and again, resulting
in poor children not getting their grants. This shambles gets worse instead
of better.

A few days earlier a woman died waiting in the queue. In February two other
people died waiting in queues. How many more deaths will it take for the
ANC to take effective action? It's all very well appointing task groups,
monitoring groups and all sorts of other talkshops to find out what is
going wrong. We know what is going wrong: People are not doing their jobs
properly, Minister, and they need to be fired. Increasing budgets means
absolutely nothing, if those getting the money out to the people for whom
it is intended, don't in fact do so.

HON MEMBERS: Hear! Hear! [Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, we all know that the hon Minister and
the department are very serious about taking care of the pensioners and
those people who are eligible for social grants. [Interjections.] Yet the
DA comes here today and they make a big spiel. They use the sensitive issue
of people dying in queues for cheap political gain. [Interjections.] We all
know that there are problems in the Eastern Cape with regard to those
people who've been contracted in.

The New NP supports the Budget Vote, yet at the same time we believe that
the Minister and his department have to deal with agents that work on
behalf of the Government and tarnish the image of this Government in terms
of looking after its people. We want to urge the Minister to launch a
thorough investigation into CPS specifically in the Eastern Cape. I thank
you. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Chairperson, we know that the greatest challenge the
Government faces is to work on the strategy of poverty alleviation while
they are at the same time trying to reduce the number of people dependent
on social development. One of the basic problems, though, appears to be a
lack of adequate staffing and a lack of leadership capacity.

The Auditor-General's report shows that the Department of Social
Development has a huge personnel vacancy of between 20% to 41,8%. It is
unacceptable that a department that is responsible for addressing the most
basic needs of the people is incapable of appointing personnel to do its
work.

There is also a problem regarding service delivery and this must be
improved. Let me also say to the Minister that we definitely need an
increase in the number of social workers. There is a tremendous need for
them in the communities that we do serve.

Besides alleviating problems of poverty, people also need properly equipped
infrastructure to go to when they experience social problems. It is very
sad to see how the state is letting our people down. Social services are
falling apart while what is simply required is for the department to take
resolute steps to employ more people.

A better policy is needed at paypoint stations to administer payouts. Long
queues, as you have seen, Minister, have obviously resulted in deaths and
so forth. We want to see that at least Social Development is proactive in
alleviating those problems, in fact, eradicating them. The long queues
should actually not be there. The ACDP supports this Budget Vote, thank
you.

Ms T E MILLEN: Thank you, Chairperson. Notwithstanding the various
concerns, including those mentioned by the Official Opposition, the IAM
supports this Vote. I thank you. [Interjections.]

Mr E SALOOJEE: Mr Chairperson, first of all let me just point out that the
hypocrisy of the DA stinks to the high heavens. [Interjections.] And I'll
tell you why. [Interjections.] Listen, I'll tell you why. With the whole
range of grants that we had, just a short while ago we set up, in a very
urgent situation, a multiparty delegation to go and look at how ID
documents are provided as well as at the problems with the payout
companies. We spent a whole week, in fact, with the recent events that had
occurred ... [Interjections.] ... Just give me a chance ...
[Interjections.] Not one of them attended the portfolio committee meetings
in which we were discussing this. [Interjections.]

When we went on on-site visits, none of them went. [Interjections.] They
stand here and they become passionate about it. They don't want to go there
and see the real suffering of the people and this is not the fault of
Social Development. It is unfortunate that some of the payout companies are
not carrying out the mandate that they were given and are not consistent
with the contracts they signed with the ANC. So for the DA to talk about
... [Interjections.] Why were they not able to come? [Interjections.]

Now, at portfolio committee meetings too, it is in Social Development that
we deal with the issues of the poor, the needy and the rural people who are
suffering. They send their weakest people there who could not even
understand the issues of social ... [Laughter.] ... the weakest ones of
them. [Interjections.] They would sit there. Their contribution to that
debate is nil. In fact, what they do there is to obstruct us. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Vote No 19 accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 20 - Sport and Recreation South Africa - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr T D LEE: Chairperson ... [Interjections.] Chairperson, in any other
country sport would serve a more noble cause. It would be a source of
inspiration. Through sport ordinary people could aspire to great things.
Most importantly, it would serve to unite a nation behind a common goal.

Under the ANC, however, sport has become a source of division and turmoil.
Under the ANC sport seems only to divide the people of this country.
[Interjections.] Under the ANC South African sport has become a political
tool in the hands of a small elite.

The DA cannot and will not support this Budget Vote, because, as in years
before, money that should be spent on development is wasted on an already
bloated bureaucracy. Money that should be used for the betterment of
sporting facilities and training of the country's youth is instead
channelled into the national Sports Commission, an organisation that simply
reflects the duties of the department itself.

The DA cannot support a budget that puts an administrative gravy train
ahead of the needs of ordinary South Africans. [Interjections.] The DA
understands that sport does not belong to the ANC. [Interjections.] The ANC
understands that this budget should be to the benefit of all South
Africans. Simply put, unlike the ANC, the DA says that this budget should
serve all our people. By that we mean all South Africans. [Interjections.]

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Chairperson, during the apartheid days it was said: ``You
cannot have normal sport in an abnormal society.'' Today, unfortunately,
you cannot have normal sport with abnormal interference and quotas.

Die feit van die saak is, hierdie Minister en sy departement het bewys dat
Suid-Afrika eintlik nie 'n Minister van Sport nodig het nie. Die wyse
waarop sport verpolitiseer word, is tot niemand se voordeel nie. Ons betaal
elke dag die prys daarvan en Suid-Afrika is moeg daarvoor. Ek stel voor ons
skaf die departement af, met Minister en al, en kry eerder 'n departement
vir werkskepping. Dankie. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[The fact of the matter is, this Minister and his department has proven
that South Africa does not really need a Minister of Sport. The way in
which sport is politicised is advantageous for no-one. We pay the price
thereof every day and South Africa is tired of this. I suggest that we do
away with the department, Minister and all, and rather have a department
for job creation. Thank you. [Interjections.]

Ms T E MILLEN: Thank you, Chairperson. This is a Vote that shouldn't even
be a Vote. It is just total nonsense and it is a total waste of money, time
and effort. [Interjections.] Just let sportsmen get on with the job of
playing for our country, for all of us. [Interjections.] Thank you, and I
definitely will be supporting the call for a division on this Vote.
[Interjections.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit gaan nie orals goed met Suid-
Afrikaanse sport nie, en dit is insiggewend dat dit met individuele
sportsoorte goed gaan, maar sleg met die spansportsoorte. Waarom? Dit is by
spansportsoorte wat die Regering se groot inmenging, kwotastelsels en wat
nog meer in die prentjie kom. Hierdie departement is vir my as't ware die
toonbeeld en die simbool van die sentralisme en totalitarisme waarmee die
Regering ongebreideld inmeng op elke lewensterrein. (Translation of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairperson, South African sport is not doing well in
every respect and it is illuminating that it is going well with individual
types of sport, but badly with team sports. Why? It is in team sports that
the Government's major interference, quota systems and whatever else come
into the picture. This department, as it were, is to me an example and a
symbol of the centralism and totalitarianism with which the Government
interferes unbridled in every walk of life.]

The NA's vote against this Budget Vote is a vote against Big Brother in the
South African society. I thank you.

Ms M R BHENGU: Chairperson, we in the ANC support this Budget Vote. The ANC
Government's policy on Sport and Recreation's theme of ``Getting the nation
to play,'' outlines the following objectives, amongst others: To increase
the level of participation in sport and recreation; and to maximise the
probability of success in major sports.

These stated objectives, which are key to our transformation agenda,
underpin the ANC Goverment's policy of promoting sport representivity and
excellence in sport.

The UCB, in a document presented to its own 2002 consolidation conference,
observed:


  Sport cannot consider itself outside the Government's political agenda,
  nor is it independent of the Government's transformation drive. Sport is
  no different to any other institution, business, education, with respect
  to transformation.


  For effective transformation in sport to take place within an acceptable
  time, Government will have to play a leadership role in the establishment
  of an overall transformation plan for implementation by sport in general
  and selected number of sporting codes in particular.

This demonstrates that sports federations are in agreement with Government
when it says transformation, unity, redress and merit are an integral part
of dealing with the legacy of apartheid and promoting the development of
sport.

Unlike other political parties, the self-appointed spokespersons for sports
federations, who misrepresent federations, the FA and the IAM, have not
attended a single meeting of the Portfolio Committee on Sports and
Recreation. [Interjections.]

We are making progress and we will continue to work for transformation in
South Africa. The ANC supports this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Division demanded.

Vote No 20 accordingly agreed to.

Vote No 21 - Correctional Services - put.

Declarations of vote:

Dr J T DELPORT: Mnr die Voorsitter, die witskrif van die Departement van
Korrektiewe Dienste sê die volgende:


  Ons glo dat oortreders die potensiaal het om positiewe
  gedragsveranderings te ondergaan en as wetsgehoorsame burgers te lewe.
  Ons doel is dus om sodanige geleenthede, fasiliteite en dienste te
  voorsien en aanhoudingstoestande te skep wat rehabilitasie en
  ontwikkeling bevorder.

Die departement se verklaring van voorneme verwys spesifiek na die
volgende:


  ... die doeltreffende en veilige bewaking ter beskerming van die
  gemeenskap, menswaardige behandeling van oortreders ...

In hierdie opsig druip die departement die toets hoofsaaklik as  gevolg  van
die oorbesetting van gevangenisse. Die Departement van  Korrektiewe  Dienste
respekteer en onderskryf die reg van elke  gevangene  om  aangehou  te  word
onder omstandighede wat hulle menswaardigheid eerbiedig.

Voorts respekteer die departement en onderskryf die  gevangene  se  reg  tot
kwaliteit gesondheidsorg.

In sy missiestelling sê die departement:


  Die werk van die departement is mense-georiënteerd en ons is dus  daartoe
  verbind om 'n kultuur van menseregte in elke faset van ons  werk  uit  te
  leef.

Die toestande in gevangenisse, primêr as gevolg van oorbesetting,  maak  van
hierdie  ideaal  'n  bespotting.  Die  strafregstelsel  dra  'n   ontsaglike
verantwoordelikheid ten opsigte van die beskerming van individuele regte  in
die besonder en menseregte in die algemeen. Die departement  slaag  nie  die
toets van die beskerming van menseregte nie. Hy slaag nie die toets van  die
erkenning van menswaardigheid nie. Die departement slaag ook nie  die  toets
van korrektiewe optrede nie.

Die DA doen weer eens 'n ernstige beroep op die Kabinet  om  die  toekenning
van fondse aan die departement opwaarts aan te  pas  sodat  hy  sy  werk  na
behore kan  doen  en  die  Grondwet  se  voorskrifte  ten  opsigte  van  die
beskerming van menseregte kan uitvoer. Ons  kan  nie  hierdie  begrotingspos
steun nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr J T DELPORT: Mr Chairperson,  the  White  Paper  of  the  Department  of
Correctional Services says the following:


  We believe that offenders have the potential to undergo positive  changes
  in behaviour and to live as law-abiding citizens. Our aim therefore is to
  provide  such  opportunities,  facilities  and  services  and  to  create
  detention conditions which would promote rehabilitation and development.

The  department's  declaration   of   intent   refers   to   the   following
specifically:


  ... the effective and safe  guarding  in  protection  of  the  community,
  humane treatment of offenders ...

In this respect the department fails the test mainly  as  a  result  of  the
overcrowding of prisons. The department of  correctional  services  respects
and endorses the right of every prisoner  to  be  held  under  circumstances
which respects their dignity.

Furthermore, the department respects and endorses the right of the  prisoner
to quality health care. In its mission statement  the  department  says  the
following:


  The work of the department is people-oriented and we are therefore
  committed to living out the culture of human rights in every facet of our
  work.

The conditions in prisons, primarily as a result of overcrowding, makes a
mockery of this ideal. The justice system carries an immense responsibility
with regards to the protection of individual rights in particular and human
rights in general. The department does not pass the test with regard to the
protection of human rights. It does not pass the test with regard to the
acknowledgement of human dignity. The department also does not pass the
test with regard to correctional action.

The DA is once again making an earnest appeal to Cabinet to upwardly adjust
the allocation of funds to the department so that it can do its work
properly and to enable it to carry out the provisions of the Constitution
with regard to the protection of human rights. We cannot support this
budget vote. [Interjections.]]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, the ACDP will not support this Budget Vote.
[Interjections.] Whilst being supportive of public-private partnerships,
the ACDP continues to share concerns that the Apops 25-year contract will
drain the department continuously. The problem of overcrowding is further
aggravated by the fact that the PPS prisons may not be overcrowded. We thus
sit with two worlds in South Africa: The very modern PPS prisons and the
appallingly overcrowded other state prisons. I have no doubt that a
constitutional challenge would succeed on grounds of equality.

The Jali Commission also informed the committee that the investigation into
various prisons has unearthed many cases of malpractice. There's
confirmation of widespread irregularities involving prisoners leaving the
premises illegally, nepotism, drug trafficking, irregular appointments of
personnel and massive medical-aid fraud. The fact that 25 members have been
seconded from the special investigation unit indicates the widespread
nature of offences and irregularities.

To be sentenced to a jail sentence today is often a death sentence, in view
of the high levels of sodomy. I will never forget, when we were recently in
North End Prison - the hon Johnny de Lange and I - we saw a child of 14
years old, and when we looked at him he turned away and started crying.
When we asked him what was wrong, he said to me: ``Die kinders was stout
met my gewees,'' and told us that he had been sodomised. So the ACDP, in
the light of these circumstances, cannot support this Budget Vote. I thank
you. [Interjections.]

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Mr Chairman, the responsibility to govern South Africa
will always remain the responsibility of the ANC. [Interjections.] It is
appropriate that the ANC, in spite of our unwilling partners and the
unwilling citizens of our country, that we proceed to do that which has
been entrusted to us by the majority of South Africans, and that is to
govern the Republic. We will not be deterred by self-seeking individuals of
no consequence who represent their own jackets here in the responsibilities
we have. [Interjections.]

The Department of Correctional Services has undergone numerous and
different stages of organisational change. This has impacted hugely on the
culture and workings of the department. However, the primary function of
the DCS has remained the safe custody of offenders. The DCS strives to
provide adequate prison accommodation, enriching rehabilitation programmes,
humane detention and treatment of offenders, reintegration programmes for
probationers and parolees, and resource management that addresses all these
initiatives.

The most serious stumbling block in the way of the institution of effective
rehabilitation programmes and provision of humane care and treatment of
offenders is overcrowding. Many are well acquainted with the daily
statistics in support of the conditions of overcrowding. The budget for
rehabilitation increased by an average of 8,3%. However, over the medium-
term the growth of the programme slowed down, owing to pressure on the Vote
of the rising prison population. As indicated by the department, most of
the increase is due to administrative expenditure. This reflects the
department's determination to focus on putting rehabilitation at the centre
of its activities by shifting funds to the rehabilitation of prisoners.

It is with great conviction that I'm able to offer my support for this Vote
and urge that the integrated justice system places the overcrowding of our
prisons and the numbers of awaiting-trial prisoners on their list of
priorities. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance, African Christian Democratic Party,
Federal Alliance and Independent African Movement dissenting).

Vote No 22 - Defence - put.
Declarations of vote:

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Hon Chairperson, the 6% increase in the Defence
budget is being usurped by the special defence account responsible for the
cost of the arms deal. A 9% increase in the salaries of personnel and the
repayment of the arms deal, which has increased by approximately
R1 billion, have inflated the special defence account to R8,8 billion, or
approximately 44% of the Defence budget. It is therefore clear that the
arms deal has been concluded at the cost of the SANDF and not in aid of the
SANDF.

This is a disparity between the funding of the department and the required
commitments requested from the SANDF. Financial problems are being foreseen
with regards to the funding of the Hawk fighter aircraft and, more
particularly, the Gripen fighter, on which Cabinet has to take a decision
soon. A review of the Defence Review is critically needed. An exit
mechanism for the approximately 15 000 troops who have to be replaced by
young, fit and healthy troops is urgently needed. The deterioration of the
personnel's health status constitutes the biggest threat to the operational
effectiveness of the SANDF. The DA does not support this Budget Vote.
[Interjections.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, om die totale kommandostelsel in
plek te hou kos R110 miljoen per jaar. Oor die aankondiging dat kommando's
uitgefaseer gaan word, sê die VF die besluit was ondeurdag, dis impulsief
en dis gebaseer op verkeerde feite.

Die kommando's word aangewend, nie net vir landelike beveiliging nie, maar
as daar 'n groot sportgebeurtenis plaasvind, soos die Wêreldbeker-
kriekettoernooi, dan is die kommandolede goed genoeg om hulle dienste te
kom aanbied. Daar is nie iets in die plek van die kommando's nie. Dis 'n
feit. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Toe die aankondiging gedoen is, was die lede in die Weermag onkant gevang,
die lede in die SA Polisiediens was onkant gevang. Daar was nie 'n plan in
plek nie. Daar word nou daaraan gewerk, en dit is 'n verdere bewys dat dit
ondeurdag is. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Verder wil ek ook meld dat die agb lid mev Thandi Modise, die voorsitter
van die portefeuljekomitee, self haar kommer uitgespreek het omdat daar te
min fondse beskikbaar is vir interne verdediging in Suid-Afrika. Die agb
Minister het met sy begroting aangekondig dat Afrika nou belangriker is as
Suid-Afrika. Die VF kan dit nie aanvaar nie, en die agb Minister kan maar
lag. Ek wil vir hom sê: Afrika gaan sy ondergang wees. Die VF sal nie
hierdie begrotingspos steun nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, it costs R110 million per year to keep
the entire commando system in place. With regard to the announcement that
commandos are to be phased out, the FF says that the decision was ill-
considered, it is impulsive and it is based on inaccurate facts.

The commandos are utilised, not only for rural safeguarding, but when a
large sporting event takes place, such as the Cricket World Cup; then the
commando members are so good as to offer their services. There is nothing
in place of the commandos. That is a fact. [Interjections.]

When the announcement was made, the members in the Defence Force were taken
unawares, and the members in the SA Police Service were taken unawares.
There was no plan in place. It is now being worked on, and that is further
evidence that this was ill-considered. [Interjections.]

Furthermore, I would also like to mention that the hon member Mrs Thandi
Modise, the chairperson of the portfolio committee, expressed her concern
because there is inadequate funding available for internal defence in South
Africa. The hon Minister announced in his budget that Africa is now more
important than South Africa. The FF cannot accept this, and the hon
Minister may laugh. I want to tell him: Africa is going to be his downfall.
The FF will not support this Vote. [Interjections.]]

Ms T R MODISE: Mr Chairman, precisely because there is no way you can
achieve stability or the ideals and aspirations of the African leaders in
Africa without making sure that the SA National Defence Force is well
trained and better equipped, that is the reason why we stood here. Yes, I
did complain about the real-terms increase of the Defence budget.

But because we are proud of the department and the achievements thus far,
we are proud of what we are acquiring for the SA National Defence Force.
Because if we do not acquire that special defence package, we will not have
a defence force. Therefore it is actually very myopic for members to stand
here and say because we are paying for the defence package we are not
supporting the Department of Defence. It is myopic. It is myopic because
when we inherited the Air Force and the Navy they were very badly equipped.

When you say that you want a credible and professional defence force, you
must be able to pay. When you talk - and these hon members here tell us
about the situation in Zimbabwe - then you must train to ensure that indeed
you can tangibly begin to contribute towards the rule of law, peace and
stability in the region and on the continent, and therefore the ANC proudly
supports this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance, Freedom Front, Federal Alliance and
Independent African Movement dissenting).

Vote No 23 - Independent Complaints Directorate - put.

Declarations of vote:

Adv P S SWART: Chairperson, the DA supports this Vote. As an independent,
both investigative and oversight body, the ICD plays an important, and
unfortunately, a much-needed role in society.

Two years ago the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security was informed
by the ICD that, due to budgetary constraints, they could only function
properly for the first eight months of the financial year. They did,
however, undertake, despite Treasury's lack of sufficient funding, to
reorganise in such a way as to be able to fulfil their obligations. And
that they did. At the last two budget briefings they indicated their
successes.

This year, with an increase of 11,6%, not much more than inflation, they
will also be toiling under an additional burden, as the closure of the SAPS
anticorruption units is already resulting in them having to deal with an
ever-increasing number of complaints of corruption against police members.

Our support for this Budget Vote is not an indication of satisfaction with
the amounts allocated to them, but a tribute to the way they proactively
manage their budget and are able to fulfil the very important function of
ensuring that the police, front runners in the fight against crime, are not
guilty themselves of crime.

Our congratulations to Advocate McKenzie and her team for work well done.
[Interjections.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Comrade Chairperson, I hope you will save my minutes for
when I respond later. We stand to support the budget of the Independent
Complaints Directorate. Thank you. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 24 - Justice and Constitutional Development - put.

Mrs S M CAMERER: Thank you, Chairperson. Even taking into account the
positive developments, such as the largest increase in funding since 1994,
some R747 million, the notoriously underresourced Justice Department - and
this has gone on for years - is not coping with the burdens placed on it.

The DA cannot support the Vote, when ordinary members of the public
experience the courts as painfully slow, inefficient and unfriendly to
their needs. Let me briefly unpack a few of the problems.
Firstly, the plight of victims is not being addressed. Withdrawal of cases
because of poor performance by state prosecutors is no comfort to the
victims of those crimes.

There is still no victims' charter or victims compensation fund, despite
two years of promises from the Department of Justice and although the
Criminal Asset Recovery Account already holds R27 million in assets
forfeited to the state, which is meant to assist victims of crime.

There is extremely low productivity in the courts, which, after all, is the
core business of the department.The long awaiting-trial periods because of
the very slow pace of cases through the courts, result in the clogging-up
of prisons with some sixty thousand trial-awaiting prisoners.

The are persistently lower conviction rates  in  relation  to  rising  crime
rates, mainly because at least half of all cases recorded  by  the  National
Prosecuting  Authority  are  withdrawn.  Over  half  a  million  cases  were
withdrawn last year.
We also experience an extreme shortage of personnel in the department.
According to a new human resource audit of the department produced by the
director-general's own office, the department is underresourced, relatively
underskilled and therefore ill-prepared to fulfil its mandate.

The DA sees insufficient progress in this Budget towards the goals of an
efficient victim-friendly court system and we therefore cannot support this
Vote. [Interjections.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, during the recent visit to Port Elizabeth by the
joint justice and correctional services Committees, we were most impressed
by the willingness of all officials to find solutions to prison
overcrowding and court backlogs. The integrated justice system approach, as
well as the pre-trial services project, will go a long way in reducing the
number of trial-awaiting prisoners.

It is a pity, however, that these projects have been shelved in certain
other provinces, following a cutback in donor funding. Our particular
thanks to Mr Kevin Hustler and Business Against Crime for the success in
these projects in the Eastern Cape.

The issue of maintenance, however, remains a severe problem, experienced by
many in our constituencies. Maintenance is often the sole means of support
for many single parents. It is estimated that there could be hundreds of
thousands of fathers who do not pay maintenance.

In Mitchells Plain it is estimated that only 5 000 of the 50 000 men who
have maintenance orders against them pay regularly. Notwithstanding the
very laudable attempts by the department, we believe that there is still a
long way to go in this regard.

A further very serious issue relates to the department's deposit account.
It is disgraceful that certain corrupt officials are robbing the public by
pocketing millions of rands deposited for maintenance payments, bail money,
fines and deceased estates. The fact that the accounts of many of the
approximate 750 courts are in a state of chaos, and that the amount of
money that has been misappropriated is, according to the chief financial
officer, at present, unknown but significant, in his words, is that this is
an issue of great concern.

The state will be held liable to make compensation for the losses that may
run into many millions, even possibly hundreds of millions of rands.
Although the department has made a lot of significant progress in this
regard, the ACDP will unfortunately not be able to support this Budget
Vote. I thank you. [Interjections.]

Ms T E MILLEN: Thank you, Chairperson. [Interjections.] The IAM supports
the previous two speakers and their sentiment and would like to add: One
thing that the Constitutional Court must do, is have a Constitutional
review to allow the enabling of the death penalty to be reintroduced.
[Interjections.]

It is absolutely essential for us to restore law and order in this mad
situation that we have. And for those who say that the death penalty is not
a deterrent, I would like to say: Has not having the death penalty been a
deterrent? Definitely not. [Interjections.] Thank you. And I will
unfortunately not support this Vote. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Chairperson, the criminal justice system faces many
challenges, but we also see significant improvements every single day
through the efforts of very dedicated people. Government has, with this
Vote, increased the budget by almost R800 million, which gives the fight
against crime a significant boost. We do not just put up posters in the
streets.

By voting against this budget the DA displays unashamed disdain for the
most vulnerable in our society namely the women and children and victims of
crime. By voting against this budget the DA votes against the many hundreds
of men and women who go to work every single day and who make the criminal
justice system work. The ANC supports those dedicated South Africans. The
ANC cares about victims of crime. The ANC therefore will unconditionally
support this budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! On what are you rising, hon
member?

Mr N J GOGOTYA: I am rising on a point of order: could the Leader of the
Opposition, the hon Tony Leon, could he please share with this House the
secret as to why he looks so happy and gay this morning, when he is usually
an angry young man? [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! That is not a point of order,
hon member. Order! Hon members, can I put the Vote? Order! Order! Hon
members, order!

Mr K M ANDREW: Thank you Chair. Chair, that hon member, the hon Mr Gogotya,
continually within this House takes points of order which he knows
perfectly well are not points of order; are in fact buffoonery and have
nothing to do with the proceedings. I would like to ask you, Chair, with
respect, what the Chairs are going to do about members who continually,
during the course of sessions, take points of order which they know very
well are not points of order? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Andrew ... order! Hon member, my
response to the hon Gogotya was that that was not a point of order and I
ruled it out. So, it is not a point of order and I would appeal to members
not to abuse points of order to raise issues that are spurious. Order!

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance, African Christian Democratic Party,
IAM and FA dissenting).

Vote No 25 - Safety and Security - put.

Declarations of vote:
Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, the hon Minister appears to be out. I hope he
is out catching criminals. He won't be surprised when I say that the DA
cannot support his policy or this Vote. South Africa has a weak criminal
justice system. What we need is a strong and effective system. Given our
high crime rate, we need a criminal justice system that works. It will only
be seen to work when the majority of criminals are arrested, tried in a
fair trial and, if convicted, then subjected to punishment which society
regards as appropriate. The punishment must fit the crime.

Everywhere I go in South Africa I find that people  have  little  confidence
in our criminal justice system. People are desperate about the  high  levels
of  crime.  Some  are  now  resorting  to  vigilante  action  and  even   to
necklacing. There is only one reason for that:  a  belief  that  the  police
will not or cannot act. South Africa can't afford  to  go  back  along  that
road.

Hiding the crime statistics from the people does not help. Our people are
not fools and they do not believe that you have crime under control. We say
that the way to get it under control is to have
150 000 policemen on the streets where we live. [Interjections.] Every
police station must be fully manned with fully trained and fully equipped
policemen. We can then hold them to agreed service standards, reward those
who deserve rewarding and punish those who deserve to be punished.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Gibson, please take your seat.

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, on a point of order: There is a rule in our
Rules which is against repetition. We have heard this comment many many
times. [Interjections.] I ask you to rule it out. [Interjections]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, that's not a point of
order.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, on point of order: The hon Andrew has just asked
you to make some kind of ruling or to do something about these frivolous
points of order that Mr Gogotya is guilty of and so is Mr Turok.
[Interjections.] We urge you, sir, to do something about it.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, Hon Ellis! Please continue, Mr
Gibson.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, the DA, whether Prof Turok likes it or not,
will continue telling the people of South Africa that you don't have crime
under control and that until you start applying decent and proper policies
you will not get crime under control. [Interjections.] Even if you are sick
of hearing it, the people outside are not sick of hearing it because they
agree with us. [Interjections.] Everywhere I go they say that the ANC is
not doing its stuff in fighting crime. [Interjections.] They beg us to do
something to help rid this country of this scourge. [Interjections.] Mr
Turok might not like it and the Minister, certainly, doesn't like it and
the rest of the ANC members don't like it but South Africa doesn't like
crime. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, can I have some order in
the House. I cannot recognise the Deputy Chief Whip until I have order in
the House.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Chair,  just  on  a  point  of
information: The Minister of Safety and Security is  in  fact  in  the  NCOP
where he is busy with a debate there.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, Deputy Chief Whip. Hon members,
that was a very noisy session. We do encourage a lively debate and are
happy with it, but I think that it was a lot more than what should have
been witnessed there.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chairman, the ACDP will not support this Budget Vote
as it will not result in the reduction of high crime levels, ensure higher
conviction rates or result in a better quality of life for our communities.
The ACDP urges Government to make crime eradication their priority in
practice and not just on paper, so that the law-abiding taxpayers will get
value for their money. The confusion brought by section-49 legislation is
unacceptable and the budget does not address the increased need for
education and training or give an acknowledgement to the gravity of the
situation.

The statistics released by the Independent Complaints Directorate that show
that police corruption had increased by more than 100% in a year are
worrying. Throwing more money at a corrupt police service without dealing
harshly with the offenders will result in greater amounts of squandered
taxpayers' money.

Government must stop talking about stabilising crime in the so-called
hotspots and start eradicating crime from all our communities. Our streets
must be made safer for all South African citizens. It is the Government and
not the community that must take responsibility for acting against the
criminal element, or they will bear the consequences of their failure do so
at the election poll. I thank you.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Voorsitter, die agb Adjunkpresident het by 'n
geleentheid gesê, en hy het ook hier in dié Huis gesê, dat dit misdadigers
is wat misbruik maak van die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika, totdat hulle in die
moeilikheid is. Dan beroep hulle hul op die goeie dinge van die Grondwet.
Die werklikheid is: As die adjunkpresident van die land alreeds so ver gaan
om sulke woorde te uiter, dan gee dit eintlik 'n aanduiding van die omvang
van misdaad in Suid-Afrika.

Die agb Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit se werk is om te verseker dat
misdaad afneem in Suid-Afrika. Die agb Minister kom elke keer en dan sê hy
dat misdaad afneem. As ons met die mense daar buite praat, dan sê hulle nie
net dat misdaad toeneem nie, maar dat hulle misdaad beleef. As 'n ondersoek
bevind dat 80% van motorkapings in 'n mens se oprit plaasvind, dan is dit
'n bose dag in ons land. Ons kan maar die syfers gaan vergelyk.

Ek wil ook kom by plaasmoorde. Ek het namens die VF 'n jaar gelede vir die
agb Minister 'n vraag gevra en hy het 'n jaar gelede al gesê dat die
oorsaak en die motiewe vir plaasmoorde bekend is. Maar die agb Minister wag
meer as 'n jaar om daardie motiewe en oorsake bekend te maak. Die VF vra:
Waarom? Die agb Minister het gesê daar is bevind dat dit gewone
misdadigheid is en roof is die motief daarvoor. Die VF kan dit nie aanvaar
nie. Ons wag vir die verslag, dan sal ons behoorlik daarop reageer, maar ek
sê vandag vir u dat wat die VF betref, is dit 'n misleiding van die mense
van Suid-Afrika oor plaasmoorde en dit kan nie toegelaat word. Die VF sal
nie die begrotingspos ondersteun nie. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, the hon Deputy President said on one
occasion, and has also said here in this House, that criminals misuse the
Constitution of South Africa, until they are in trouble. They then invoke
the good things in the Constitution. The reality is: If the Deputy
President of the country is already going so far as to say such things, it
actually gives an indication of the extent of crime in South Africa.
The job of the hon Minister for Safety and Security is to ensure that crime
decreases in South Africa. The hon the Minister comes and says that crime
is decreasing every time. If we talk to the people out there, they say that
not only is crime increasing, but they are experiencing crime. When an
investigation finds that 80% of car hijackings take place in one's
driveway, it is a dark day in our country. We can compare the figures.

I also want to refer to farm murders. A year ago I asked the Minister a
question on behalf of the FF and a year ago already he said that the cause
and the motives for farm murders were known. But the hon Minister waited
for more than a year to make those motives and causes known. The FF asks:
Why? The hon Minister said that it was found that this is common
criminality and that theft is the motive for it. The FF cannot accept this.
We are waiting for the report and we will then respond to it properly, but
I will tell you today that as far as the FF is concerned, the people of
South Africa are being misled with regard to farm murders and it cannot be
allowed. The FF will not support the Vote. [Time expired.]]

Ms T E MILLEN: Chairperson, the IAM [Interjections.] cannot support this
Vote and, by the way, to call it Safety and Security is probably one of the
biggest misnomers of any Ministry. It should be the Ministry of danger and
insecurity because that is what we are all suffering from in this country.
So, I will not support this Vote and I will be one of those calling for a
division. Thank you.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, the day the Minister of Safety and Security
gets excited if he can say that the statistics of crime have stabilised,
then the writing will be on the wall.

Misdaadstatistiek in Suid-Afrika wys dat ons in sekere gevalle die grootste
misdaadsyfer ter wêreld het. Ons vra steeds die vraag hoekom die Minister
die gegewens nie wil bekend maak nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daar is te veel ``
hit and run crackdowns'' en te min ``Bobby on the beat''. En nou kan ek aan
u voorspel dat die ANC gaan sê: Ons is teen die veiligheidsmagte, ons is
teen ons polisiemanne; maar ek wil vir u noem dat ons hierdie beleid nie
kan ondersteun nie. Die kommissaris het gesê dat plaasmoorde afneem, maar
gee nie vir ons die statistiese gegewens nie. Hy wil hê ons moet hom glo,
sonder 'n enkele syfer. Dis nie wat ons op die veld ervaar nie. Die
Nasionale Aksie kan hierdie begrotingspos ongelukkig nie ondersteun nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Crime statistics in South Africa show that we, in certain instances, have
the highest crime rate in the world. We still ask the question why the
Minister does not want to publish the data. [Interjections.] There are too
many ``hit and run crackdowns'' and too few ``Bobbies on the beat''. And
now I can predict to you that the ANC will say ``We are against the safety
forces, we are against our police force'', but I want to say that we cannot
support this policy. The commissioner said that farm murders are on the
decrease, but he does not give us the statistical data. He wants us to
believe him without a single figure. That is not what we experience on the
ground. The National Action can unfortunately not support this Budget
Vote.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Comrade Chairperson, we support the budget. The 11%
increase, we believe, will go a long way in the fight against crime.

The fight against crime is one of the most challenging aspects of our
country. Although we said previously that we have managed to turn the tide
against crime, we want to emphasise the fact that there is still a lot to
be done, as the level of crime still remains unacceptably high. I must
quickly add that the situation is under control. Crime is continuously
being stabilised. There is no crisis in the country. [Interjections.] There
is no chaotic situation, as others would like us to believe. The police are
doing their work and are arresting criminals.

We proudly acknowledge that the more efficient, co-ordinated
interdepartmental approach to crime prevention and combating has meant more
successes in stabilising crime. Successes include the 16 days of activism
on nonviolence against women and children in 2002 by the JPCS cluster.
Operations Tsipa, Sethunya and the recent Operation Tswikila continue to
succeed in stabilising organised crime, confiscating stolen vehicles and
destroying redundant and illegal firearms. Despite a high rate of crime
syndicates and gangsters, the murder rate continues to go down as well.
From the year 2000 to 2003 these operations led to more than half a million
arrests, more than 15 000 confiscation of stolen vehicles and the
destruction of more than
100 000 stolen and redundant firearms.

I appeal - and I will make this appeal every day, especially to the DA -
that we must unite against crime instead of using it for electioneering.
Nobody is going to believe you. I heard Mr Gibson saying some people
believe him. I don't know who are the people that he was talking about but
I know that you will see it next year that the people do not believe you.
[Applause.] [Time expired.]

Vote No 25 accordingly agreed to.
Vote No 26- Agriculture- put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr S B FARROW: Hon Chairperson, the DA will support both this Vote and Vote
30. According to the strategic plan of South African agriculture, primary
agriculture accounts for 4,5% of the GDP, whilst the agro-food complexes
account for another 9%. There are approximately 50 000 large commercial
farmers who employ about a million workers or 11% of the total formal
employment in South Africa.

In effect, commercial farms provide livelihoods and housing for
approximately 6 million family members. In addition to these farmers, there
are also 240 000 small farmers, who also provide more than a million
livelihoods for their family members and employment to another 500 000
people. These small farmers supply locally and regional markets where large
numbers of informal traders make a living.

Furthermore, there are an estimated 3 million farmers in communal areas who
produce food, primarily to meet their families' needs. It is therefore no
wonder that about 40% of the country's total population is primarily
dependent on agriculture and related industries. It is therefore critical
that the Department of Agriculture continues to support and grow the
agricultural sector, if we are to remain self-sufficient in food and fibre
whilst generating marketable surpluses to meet both regional and export
demands.

Key to success is the need for agricultural research, effective and
efficient support and delivery services, safety and security on our farms
and land-tenure reform, particularly for those new entrants coming into the
agricultural sector. The Department needs to reprioritise its budgets to
meet these challenges because we do not need to end up like Zimbabwe.

Adequate funds must be made available for agriculture and land purchases,
as was demonstrated by the protest outside Parliament today. The 2003
Budget has yet to take the bull by the horns in implementing the strategic
plans, vision and for ... [Time expired.]

[Mr N H MASITHELA: Chairperson, there is no way that the ANC cannot agree
with Mr Farrow, because of the way he spoke. The ANC does not have the will
to disagree with this input. Today's budget shows that the ANC is
determined to do away with dishonesty, starvation and poverty. That is why
we say that everybody who has spoken here and everybody who agrees with
this budget is showing that starvation will be done away with.

Right now we are out to show the citizens of South Africa. We also urge
those who have not yet asked for funds and agricultural instruments to do
so, because he who wastes time will be left behind. The ANC Government has
realised that black people do not have money. That is why the Government
says that everybody who is black and wants to own a farm should hurry up
and get in touch with the Department of Agriculture, because only those who
make an effort will be helped.

Chairperson, as there is no party that disagrees with what has been said
here, let me be very brief as one can never say it all. The ANC supports
this budget. Thank you.]

Vote agreed to.

Vote No 27 - Communications - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms M SMUTS: Madam Speaker, this is the first year that I can remember that
we have not called for a division on Communications. We will simply object
because the hon Minister has announced a policy overhaul in line with the
DA's proposals on technological neutrality and the separate regulation of
transmission and content in the age of convergance. If we helped to force
the DOC's hand, then that is some reward for the long hours of work we put
into a policy field which so fascinates us. However, the policy overhaul
has to be fundamental. It must not only benefit the state-run companies.

Gardner Data Quest has made an interesting assertion about South Africa. It
says that we are Western in our ways, but Eastern in our aim. We are caught
in a cultural warp. Like China, Gardner argues, our Government has, until
now, addressed teledensity through social legislation, and I quote:


  A firm governmental grip on stakeholdership, in what it considers its
  infrastructure, allowing only tightly controlled entry by private
  investment.

The description, in my view, is devastatingly apt. The point, however, is
that South Africa's consumers have spoken and expressed their preferences.
They go for the Western model. They are South Africa's voters too. At the
moment, we have a Government which still wants to control the industry, but
the private sector is better at running it. It is time for the Government
to leave it to the experts. We look forward to the policy conferences
designated for July and we also look forward to appropriate policy change.

Mr M K LEKGORO: Madam Speaker, for those of us whose life experiences have
been to communicate with our families, who include uncles and cousins in
rural areas through letter writing only, the roll-out of telephones to
these areas has brought much-needed relief. Our loved ones are now so far,
but yet so near. Within seconds one is able to determine how they are, who
is not feeling well, who has passed away and who is getting married.

If one has not gone through the pain of exchanging this information only
through letter writing, one is likely to take this great change in our
lives for granted. To us the tide has turned for a better life.
Once more, Telkom's maiden results after listing have vindicated the ANC-
led Government who believes that managed liberalisation of state assets is
a sound approach, as opposed to the populist approach of the opposition of
wholesale privatisation. The listing of Telkom affords previously
disadvantaged communities the opportunity to partake in the
telecommunication sector.

Lastly, we are sure that the South African Post Office is on its way to
sound financial and human resource management. Their breakthrough in
corruption in the institution is a good account in this regard. From a
subsidy of more than R600 million, it has now halved it to R300 million. It
is our hope that as they improve, the remaining deficit will disappear. We
support Vote no 27. [Applause.]

Vote No 29 - Housing - put and agreed to (African Christian Democratic
Party dissenting).
Vote No 30 - Land Affairs - put and agreed to (National Action dissenting).

Vote No 31 - Minerals and Energy - put and agreed to.

Vote No 32 - Trade and Industry - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr C M LOWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the DA will not support this Vote. The
Department of Trade and Industry should be the engine room for economic
growth and development policies and initiatives in South Africa. It should
be the driving force behind the Government with a bold vision and radical
plan to stimulate growth and create jobs that will see South Africans
everywhere enjoying a rising standard of living and an expanding economy.

Instead, after ten years of ANC Incorporated, we have over one million jobs
lost and 40% of our people unemployed; instead of broad-based black
economic empowerment that achieves what its title implies, we have
allegations and evidence of cronyism, nepotism and shady oil deals; instead
of creating new wealth and rapidly expanding the economic path to include
those left behind by apartheid, we see the transfer of existing
infrastructure and capital to a well-connected elite that leaves ordinary
black South Africans just as marginalised and disadvantaged as ever they
were.

The DTI, under the policies of the ANC Inc, has got it all wrong. South
Africa cannot afford political correctness, let alone nepotism or cronyism,
wabenzi-opportunism at the expense of competence and efficiency and
fairness. If that happens, South Africans everywhere will pay the price and
the jobless queues will simply grow longer.

Ms T E MILLEN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the greatest concern of the IAM is the
proliferation of gambling, which falls under this department's Vote, and,
in particular, the recent installation of the LPOs or low-pay-out
operations in rural areas. The sight of a lady on television last night
operating one of these machines, saying that she hoped to win `maybe R40,
so that she could buy some food', is a shocking indictment on the placement
of these machines among the most vulnerable and impoverished in our
country. Similar commendable statements decrying the situation were
expressed by the hon Minister of Social Development on the same programme.
Thank you, hon Minister.

I opposed gambling with regard particularly to its social effects on
society while an IFP MPP in KwaZulu-Natal, much to the chagrin of the
premier during this debate in 2001. The IAM still opposes gambling for the
same reasons and will not be supporting this Vote for that reason alone.

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Deputy Speaker, during the Budget Vote debate on trade
and industry we were able to report to the House that there was steady
progress in the DTI's stewardship of the R2,5 billion entrusted to it by
the House; there has been a substantial reduction in underspending to the
extent that it is no longer a significant problem for this department;
there is a greater alignment of budgetary priorities to organisational
categories in the department and significant progress in ensuring that
measurable indicators, related to the priorities of promoting economic
growth and development, empowerment and equity, are actually achieved.

Mr Lowe raised a number of spurious points and I don't think that there is
any basis on which Mr Lowe's charges can be sustained. There is no
indication that there is any condoning of cronyism and nepotism in the
department. Where instances are backed up by solid evidence, they are
normally investigated and investigated to significant effect.

What Mr Lowe is doing is that he is objecting, he should note, to an
increased allocation which is equivalent to 52% per annum increase since
1999 to promote black economic empowerment, which he claims to support. He
is also objecting to programmes which are projected to leverage in R14,5
billion worth of investment for small, medium and microenterprise
development and for strategic investments which are capable of creating 32
000 new jobs and sustaining 88 000 jobs.

Ms Millen of the IAM appears to be ignorant of the fact that the ANC/NNP-
coalition government in the Western Cape is taking a strong stand against
the roll-out of the limited-pay-up machines, which has the full support of
the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry, and this I think is an
indication of the pro-poor stance which the ANC/NNP-coalition government in
the Western Cape is taking. The ANC will, of course, support Budget Vote
32. [Applause.]

Vote agreed to (Democratic Alliance and Independent African Movement
dissenting).

Vote No 33 - Transport - put.

Declarations of vote:
Mr S B FARROW: Madam Deputy Speaker, the acting Minister of Transport
doesn't deserve this. The Department of Transport against falls short of
meeting its priority. Consistent underfunding and improper use of funding
mechanisms through the fuel levy has resulted in the backlog of R63 billion
in our road maintenance programmes alone.

The department has finally recognised  the  problem  with  the  Government's
road funding policies. In its latest draft policy on  the  funding  of  road
networks it admits that  while  the  fuel  levy  is  intended  to  fund  the
maintenance of our roads, it has been used increasingly  by  the  Government
to finance other needs like health and education.

The DA has consistently called for the fuel  levy  maintenance  fund  to  be
ringfenced and  allocated  proportionally  to  provinces  on  a  conditional
basis. The lack  of  adequate  funding  has  forced  SANRA  to  go  for  the
unpopular route of tolling, and in the eyes of many motorists  this  amounts
to double taxation.

Our railway infrastructure and rolling stock suffers from a similar backlog
that impacts on safety. The taxi industry, our biggest public transporter,
is still suffering from lack of clear direction as to how it will be
subsidised and the recap scheme has not yet been rolled out. Meanwhile the
average age of the fleet and the unroadworthiness of some vehicles have
contributed to poor levels of service and safety.

Congestions, inefficiencies and lack of proper maintenance of our ports has
resulted in delays in most of our ports and the lost of credibility by
shipping lines.

The Arrive Alive campaign funding is in jeopardy with a technically
insolvent RAF, unable to provide monetary support and unable to meet its
strategic objectives. Coupled with this is a major shortfall in funds to
implement the Road Traffic Management Corporation, which forms part of
vital legislation to unite all national, provincial and local road safety
authorities to eliminate the current fragmentation and address the
shortfalls of over 8 000 police in our country.

The department's ability to manage and deliver on a seemless and efficient
aviation, maritime and road service fall short of strategic objects and the
budget does little to integrate and financially support these services. The
DA therefore has no alternative but to object to this budget, and I hope
the Minister of Finance takes note of this. This is the fourth time that I
have asked him to put more money in the transport Vote. [Applause.]

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the transport budget  provides  for
increased spending for the maintenance  and  development  of  infrastructure
and for the provision of affordable public transport. The ANC  welcomes  the
department's focus on the provision of safe and affordable public  transport
to those in our country with the greatest need, namely the  poorest  of  the
poor.  In  particular,  this  includes  funding  for  the  refurbishment  of
railcoaches and the continued upgrading and expansion of our  road  network,
with specific focus on the upgrading of rural roads.

The ANC welcomes and applauds the work being undertaken by the South
African Maritime Safety Authority amongst the fishing community, equipping
them with much-needed safety training for when they are out at sea. We in
the ANC look forward to the rolling out of the Taxi Recapitalisation
Programme and the implementation of the roads traffic operations policy.

I just want to say to Mr Farrow: you obviously don't sit in the same
portfolio committee that I do. Because if you sat there and listened you
would hear about the increase in funding that has taken place in the
department.

By objecting to this vote the DA says it does not care about the poorest of
the poor ... [Interjections.] ... and wish them to remain without access to
affordable, safe and reliable transport. The ANC supports this Budget Vote.
Thank you. [Applause.]

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move
without notice: That the House elects Mr Billy Nair to preside during
today's sitting of the House when requested to do so by a presiding
officer.

Agreed to.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

Mr N M NENE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker and hon members, I  would  also  like
to take this opportunity to congratulate comrade Billy  on  his  appointment
to the Chair.
When the majority of the people of South Africa voted the ANC into power,
it was mainly because of our track record of standing our ground, no matter
what the challenges were. One of the biggest challenges we faced was an
ailing economy that we inherited from the apartheid regime. A huge budget
deficit, rising unemployment, double-digit inflation, skewed distribution
of income and land; and also the total exclusion of the vast majority of
our people from the economy and a decent social life.

The government of the people is addressing all these problems. We therefore
have serious steady economic growth, a reduced budget deficit, inflation is
under control and the majority of our people are beginning to share in the
country's wealth.

Over the past nine years the ANC Government has laid a solid foundation
upon which a better life for all has steadily been realised. During the
Budget Votes we have heard how much the departments have done to improve
the lives of our people, following the programmes the ANC has developed and
the tough choices we have had to make in order to address the challenges
that I have alluded to.

Our economic policies have given us the platform and leverage to be where
we are today. Today we are in a position that allows us to give effect to
the developmental programme through increased spending in the areas that
matter most to be able to push back the frontiers of poverty. The expansion
of the Public Works programme, increased spending on health, and education
with a particular emphasis on primary health and improving adult illiteracy
and skills development are indicative of a caring ANC Government.

The budget process has undergone tremendous transformation itself. With the
introduction of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework, the new budgeting
format, including the introduction of the estimates of expenditure that
require departments to outline their measurable objectives, and the
estimates of national expenditure and also the establishment of the joint
budget committee, that monitors expenditure on a regular basis, ensures
compliance with the Public Finance Management Act. This has placed us in a
position that allows Government and Parliament to interact more
meaningfully with the Budget.

The joint budget committee's first report has since been tabled in
Parliament last week and we are going to engage in a very robust debate
that will see our recommendations being implemented. These are all steps
taken in the name of delivery of services to our people to improve their
lives and push back the frontiers of poverty.

The DA has clearly demonstrated their opposition to transformation by
voting against spending money on health, spending money on education,
provincial and local government, sports and recreation, safety and security
and two other Votes which are in the Presidency. Their argument on all the
mentioned Budget Votes is nothing more than the same argument that was
advanced by the previous government and caused the problems we are
addressing.

So, listening to them will take us back to where we come from and that we
have worked so hard to break away from. When the ANC fights for a better
life, the DA fights back. When the ANC wants every child to get an
education, the DA fights back. When the ANC appropriates money for health
for all South Africans, the DA fights back. When the ANC allocates money to
provinces and local government for the provision of free basic services,
the DA fights back. When the ANC allocates money to safety and security to
employ and train a realistic number of personnel, the DA fights back with a
call for 150 000 untrained and ill-equipped police on the streets. The same
applies to sports and recreation. For as long as the DA exists as
custodians of apartheid and the ``swart gevaar'' [Black danger.], our
people will never be free.

In supporting this Appropriation Bill, the ANC continues to lead the war
against poverty and deprivation and I assure our people that we will never
give up. We owe it to the masses of this country that continue to support
us. I thank you, Chairperson.
Ms R TALJAARD: Thank you, Chairperson, as we debate the Appropriation Bill
today it is clear that South Africa confronts three key challenges:
Unemployment in excess of 30%, alarming levels of crime, the devastating
economic, social and human consequences of the HIV/Aids tragedy unfolding
in every corner of South Africa every day. While this Budget has marketed
itself under the slogan of ``the right thing to do'', there are a number of
areas in which we continue to do the wrong thing.

The naysayers would continue to berate those who say South Africa's labour
market inflexibility continues to be an aggravating factor in hampering job
creation. However, even in the former doyens of corporatism, such as
Germany and the highly protected labour markets of that country, they have
had to revise their position in the context of sluggish growth, persistent
unemployment and the strictures of the growth and stability pact.

German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, had to take in very difficult
political times for his Social Democratic Party some clear, courageous and
bold steps to alleviate the current problems in the labour market in
Germany and institute long-overdue structural reform.

Only in South Africa can a Growth and Development Summit, that excludes the
item of labour market flexibility completely from the agenda, be regarded
as a success. This is not an argument about rolling back workers' rights in
toto. It is about being in touch with reality and making pragmatic policy
choices that reflect that reality, not policy choices that reflect
artificial political marriages of convenience on the eve of the 2004
election.

In respect of the fight against crime and HIV/Aids, it is clear that
Government has its priorities inverted. Any government that can afford to
purchase additional maritime helicopters and increase the already costly
bill of the strategic defence procurement, with arrogant disregard for any
accountability for the controversial decisions taken in the flawed
procurement process, itself has its priorities inverted.

Any government willing to incur an addition R212 million foreign loan
liability from Societe Generale for a Corvette combat suite that is touted
to be a mere subcontractor in the budget review, clearly has its priorities
inverted. It is a government with very strange priorities indeed. It is a
government that needs to be reminded that the wars against crime, poverty,
joblessness and HIV can never be fought or won decisively and convincingly
with Corvettes, Hawks, Gripen, submarines or light-utility helicopters.

When the Minister of Finance tabled the Budget in this House in February,
it was rightly criticised for falling short in announcing the much-awaited
costing for an HIV/Aids National Treatment Roll-out Plan. A mere
R3,3 billion was allocated in the Budget to this end over the MTF period.

To answer the criticism, the Minister and officials were quick to point out
that the comprehensive costing study would be released in April. When the
study was released it was clear that National Treasury had given the plan a
cautious thumbs up. As the Director-General of Finance told the finance
committee during its deliberations on the strategic plan of the National
Treasury, Cabinet will now deliberate on this costing plan.

We must ask, as we adopt this Budget today: What has happened to the
HIV/Aids costing plan thus far? Will it dwell in the labyrinths of Cabinet
obfuscation, never to be seen or heard of again? The Minister of Finance
and the National Treasury have a particular and specific duty to the people
of South Africa to spearhead the affordability study for a national
HIV/Aids antiretroviral treatment roll-out through this Cabinet. They
control the purse strings and they must lobby for the affordability study,
even if Dr No or any higher authority may wish to obfuscate any further or
say, no.

Not only is Government's credibility on this matter yet again at stake but
its compliance with an order of the Constitutional Court may very well be
in doubt as well. While there is such a thing as collective Cabinet
responsibility, Minister Manuel, in this regard a very special
responsibilty does rest on your shoulders to act as an advocate for this
affordability plan. I thank you.

Dr G G WOODS: Thank you, Chairperson. [Interjections.] Thanks, Minister, I
thought you were getting at me. Our approach is not going to be to get into
the specifics we engaged at the time the 2003 Budget came out, but rather
to reflect back on the debates on the various Votes that have gone through
this House in recent weeks. I think having supported the spending framework
which accompanied the 2003 Budget, we have looked forward to the Ministers
presenting their budgets to the House. I think in this situation we would
like to acknowledge that Ministers have in general this year shown
increased purpose and focus. We can attribute this largely to the new
formalised strategic planning which has taken place in the departments, and
also the fact that we are now looking towards issues such as measurable
objectives, as were given birth to through the PFMA.

But it is in this regard important for us to restate certain misgivings
regarding the insufficiency of particular tools and expertise necessary to
fully achieve the Budget intentions which the members of the Executive have
expressed over the course of these Votes. And, firstly, on the issue of
tools again, I think of the yet-to-be-introduced performance budgeting
system, which the PFMA intends as the means through which to achieve
improved value-for-money spending; and on the expertise side, of the
serious shortage of levels of financial management ability and knowledge of
course necessary to meet the high aims of the PFMA. And here again we must
urge the Ministers of Finance and Public Service and Administration to keep
up their efforts in these areas of concern.

I would like to take the unusual step of reflecting on Parliament's
performance in the debates that have preceded today's event. And hereto I
think the quality of debate of members has shown too that we also suffered
from the lack of tools. I think the oversight measures, which are still
going to introduce the performance budgeting system of the PFMA, will offer
us some in the time to come. Another issue was the lack of participation in
the Budget formulation process and the long-outstanding Money Bills
amendment powers, which the House wants.  But the hon Nene has referred to
this, I think, under his chairmanship of the new Budget Committee. We
should take that issue forward. But beyond that I would just like to remind
the House that we do support the Budget and this Appropriation Bill. Thank
you very much.

Mnr A BLAAS: Mnr die Voorsitter, hierdie begroting fokus op
armoedeverligting; sonder enige twyfel huidig die hoogste prioriteit hier
in Suid-Afrika. Dit word gedoen binne die beperkings van die begroting deur
groei te stimuleer, werkskepping aan te moedig en deur beleggings in
programme wat dienslewering aan armes verskaf. Binne hierdie raamwerk kan
daar heelwaarskynlik klemverskuiwings wees.

Die ACDP sou 'n groter klem wou sien op insette wat groei kon stimuleer en
mense vinniger onafhanklik maak van die staat, weliswaar ten koste van
sommige van die beoogde diensleweringsprogramme. Prioriteite sou verskuif
word na onder meer groter ondersteuning aan mikro-, klein en medium
ondernemings en die vestiging van insentiewe vir nuwe nywerhede terwyl die
beoogde vaardigheidsontwikkelingsprojekte en die ondersteuning aan onderwys
en opleiding behou word. Meer buigsaamheid in arbeidswetgewing sou ook
noodsaaklike aandag geniet.

Binne hierdie beperkings sal die ACDP hierdie wetsontwerp steun. Dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Mr Chairperson, this budget focuses on poverty alleviation;
without a doubt currently the highest priority here in South Africa. This
is done within the limitations of the budget by stimulating growth,
encouraging job creation and by investment in programmes that supply
service delivery to the indigent. Within this framework there could most
likely be shifts in emphasis.

The ACDP would have liked to see greater emphasis on inputs that can
stimulate growth and make people independent of the state more quickly,
admittedly at the expense of some of the envisaged service delivery
programmes. Priorities would be shifted to, inter alia, more support to
micro, small and medium enterprises and the establishment of incentives for
new industries while the envisaged skills development programmes and
support of education and training is retained. More flexibility in labour
legislation would also enjoy the necessary attention.

Within these limitations the ACDP will support this legislation. Thank
you.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Acting Deputy Chair, after much debate we return to debate
the Appropriation Bill. The MF has been most pleased with the debate
concerning the Budget Votes. Debates have clearly deposited the House
stance and commitment to utilising and dispensing funds wisely to benefit
all South Africans. As in our debate in March concerning the Appropriation
Bill, the MF continues to voice its support of funds appropriated to
various spheres according to need. The substantial appropriation for safety
and security of 16,38% deposits our nation's commitment to stamping out
crime. The MF, however, hopes that the necessary role-players shall now
ensure that funds are utilised adequately to meet our ends efficiently. The
MF supports the Appropriation Bill.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRPERSON (Mr B Nair): The next speaker is the hon Cassie
Aucamp, but I believe he was busy with a TV interview.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter ...

Die MINISTER VAN FINANSIES: Hy maak 'n las van homself!

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, dit word laat. Ek sal nie 'n las van
myself maak nie. Die NA steun hierdie begrotingswetsontwerp. Ek dank u.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman ...

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: He is making a nuisance of himself!

Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, it is getting late. I will not make a nuisance of
myself. The NA supports this Budget Vote. I thank you. [Interjections.]]

Ms N S MTSWENI: Ndabezitha [Honourable] Chairperson, I realise that as we
draw to an end of this session hon members are tired. However, we have in
front of us various budgets that we need to vote on today. Everyone of them
has a strong element of transformation and they have made a real difference
in the lives of our people. This Budget has responded to the challenge of
pushing back the frontiers of poverty and expanding access to a better life
for all.

This Budget, colleagues, is not an accounting system. We are talking about
an allocation exercise, spending it properly and in such a way that
ordinary people feel the benefits. The Budget is the most important policy
instrument we have in order to improve the lives of our people. And indeed
if we reflect today on where we are and where we come from we say with
pride that much has changed in our country and millions of our people have
started feeling the benefits of the caring Government that is committed to
dealing with poverty. That is what the Government of the ANC is all about
and that is what is reflected in the Budget that we are dealing with today.

The good news is that, through managing our economy responsibly and through
good economic policies, we are able to increasingly translate our policies
into practical programmes that benefit the poor. Even with the best
policies in the world, we would not make a difference, unless we have the
resources to implement them and that is the next piece of good news. It is
not only this year that we are able to spend on the poor of the poorest in
our country, but this increases year-after-year for the full Medium-Term
Expenditure period. We are confident that it will continue beyond this
three-year period.
We are now poised, more than ever before, to transform our country and to
tackle the problems of poverty and equality head-on. I would like to share
with you some real examples on social security: The Unemployment Insurance
Fund, which has and will continue to bring back the dignity of our domestic
workers; the child support grant currently accessible to children until the
age of seven years old has been extended to children of 14 years. This will
be implemented in phases, which means that those who are seven years and
eight years old will access the grant in 2003/2004 and those who are nine
and ten years in 2004/2005 and those who are 11, 12, 13 and 14 years old,
will access it in 2005/2006. This will improve the standard of living of
the poorest children and will be an effective weapon in pushing back the
frontiers of poverty.

This Budget has brought a better life to our elders and the disabled people
of our country. The majority of our elders had their pensions paid out once
in three months while others were entitled to a monthly pension. At this
present time our elders and the disabled get their pensions every month.
This pro-poor Budget continues to make sure that the food relief grant is
designed to minimise the negative impact of high food prices on poverty-
stricken individuals, households and vulnerable communities. The Budget has
further increased support for home-based care for our people with HIV/Aids.

All of the above have a positive impact on the women of South Africa. I am
happy because they are aware that this change is there because of the ANC
Government. In my constituency where I am deployed ...

Kua Bakgatleng  ba  Moshe,  Ba  Mokgoko,  ba  Chaane  le  kua  ...  [At  the

[They gained a lot of development and they said I must thank the ANC-led
Government.]

In the short space of time that we have had as the ANC ...

Amatjhuguluko abekhona, nangifika lapha besinesibhedlela sinye lapho  abantu
bekhethu gade baya  khona,  babhadale  iimali  ezinengi,  bakhamba  iindlela
ezide, bafike bajame imijeje emide  bebadinwe,  balambe,  babuyele  emakhaya
balambile sele bagula okwesibili kanti balatjhiwe.

Okhunye okwenzekileko, iinkolo nangifika  lapha  bezingacaleki,  njenga  nje
iinkolo zoke zilungisiwe Mbuso we ANC, kukhona  nezinye  ezitja  ezakhiweko.
Kanti kukhona amabala  wemidlalo  amabili,  lapho  abantwana  bethu  bakwazi
ukuzithokozisa khona, kukhona  godu  ne-Multi  Purpose  Centre.  Koke  lokhu
kwenziwe Mbuso we ANC. Kulapho ngisebenza khona  angikhulumi  ngendawo  yoke
yeMpumalanga,  ngikhuluma  nje  ngendawo  lapho  mina  ngithunyelwe   yi-ANC
eMoretele Two, kilapho lamatjhuguluko enzeke khona. Kanti  akusizo  kwaphela
lezi  engikhuluma  ngazo  zinengi  ezikhona  engingazibala  kuze   kutjhinge
ilanga. (Translation of isiNdebele paragraphs follows.)

[Changes have taken place since my arrival at that place. Previously we  had
only one hospital where our people went for consultations,  paid  a  lot  of
money, had to walk long distances and wait in long queues  until  they  were
tired and hungry. They returned home hungry and  sick,  although  they  just
been cured of other illnesses.

When I arrived there, schools were in a  state  of  disrepair.  By  now  all
schools have been repaired  by  the  ANC  Government;  in  other  areas  new
schools have been built. And there are two stadiums where our  children  can
entertain themselves. There is also a multipurpose centre.  All  these  have
been delivered by the ANC Government. I am  only  talking  about  the  place
where I work, not about the whole of Mpumalanga.  I  am  talking  about  the
place where I am deployed by the ANC, at Moretele Two. This is  where  these
changes have taken place. These  are  not  the  only  changes.  If  I  start
counting them all, I will talk the sun sets.]

We have also provided water, housing, electricity and roads for our people.

Abantu bekhethu abasakhambi amabanga  amade,  niyazi  bonyana  abomma  ngibo
abathwala lomthwalo khulu. Makufuneka  kube  nokudla  phezu  kwetafula  umma
kufuneka azi bonyana kuba namanzi kubanayo yoke into. Manje  uMbuso  we  ANC
ulethe zoke lezinto eduze kwabantu bethu khona bazozithola  ngobuduze.  [Our
people no longer have to walk long  distances.  Members  know  that  mothers
bear the hardship the most. When there needs to be food on  the  table,  the
mother makes sure that  there  is  water  and  all  other  things.  The  ANC
Government has brought all this closer to the people.]

When I see these things happening especially to children  who  go  to  these
schools, I see smiles on their faces,  joy  and  happiness,  confidence  and
hope for their future in education. This is what this Budget has  done.  The
Government of the ANC will continue to transform the  education  system  and
better the education of an  African  child  in  particular.  With  all  this
happening, I feel proud to be a member of the ANC and proud to stand  up  in
this  House  and  support  this  Budget  Vote.  I  thank  you,   ndabezitha!
[honourable!]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Wena Wendlovu! [Your Highness!]

The  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Thank  you,  Chairperson   and   hon   members.
Congratulations to you, Ndabezitha. It's good to  see  you  sitting  in  the
Chair up there.

Chairperson, this debate brings to an end four months of intense discussion
- clearly the heart and soul of political oversight, of Parliament, but an
opportunity that we must give ourselves in the course of this debate to
reflect on where we are. I think it's important, in this context, to say
that the process of budget reform that has taken place in this country over
the past nine years places us in a position where, truly, we have empowered
this Parliament in its oversight function. Each year the changes have been
significant. The introduction of the Estimates of National Expenditure last
year and, this year, the introduction of measurable objectives place this
Parliament in a position where every member has a responsibility through a
portfolio committee, but also through this plenary discussion, and a
position in respect of an oversight function. That becomes important.

Now, when one looks back - and I want to be quite blunt about this - at the
debate in the portfolio committees, what for me has been a bit of a tragedy
has been the absence of focus on the measurable objectives. It's there,
it's published, it's part of a contract that the executive has with
Parliament, but the living out of that function one hasn't seen. I think
that it's important that we continue to focus on that interface between
Parliament and the executive.

But there is something Parliament cannot do, and therefore, with great
respect to members like the hon Taljaard, I won't respond to the fact that
sometimes some members of Parliament would like to see themselves in the
position of the executive. The policy choices will remain those of the
executive. We'll go to the hustings later this year, we'll go to the polls
next year, we go to the electorate so that they can decide who exercises
the options in respect of the Budget. That is correct, and that is what
this Government will not give away. [Applause.] We implement our policies
through the Budget, and I'm sure that while some parties in this House have
no ambition to be anything other than opposition, somewhere in the back of
their heads they too understand very clearly that you win the right to
implement the Budget. [Interjections.] There's no automaticity, and this
Government's not about to give away the rights that we've won in shaping
democracy. [Interjections.] Despite what Mike Ellis, or the hon Ellis,
might feel, it's not going to be like that. He knows it, I know it, all of
South Africa knows it. It's not going to be like that.

So let's leave aside the policy issues. Let's focus on Parliament's role,
and here, Chairperson, with the greatest respect, I think that we must say
to Parliament, as the hon Woods did, that we must continue to work at
empowering Parliament to ensure that the oversight function is lived out.
The Budget committee now makes a very substantial difference. I want to
express my appreciation to the hon Nene for the work that they are doing in
respect of the reports. The Budget committee now analyses those reports on
in-year spending which are published in terms of section 32 of the Public
Finance Management Act, and they're doing a very solid job. They are able
to demonstrate where there's underspending and where there's the risk of
overspending. I'd like to encourage the chairpersons and members of all
portfolio committees to avail themselves of the opportunity not only to
debate Budget issues once a year when a department appears before the
portfolio committee, but, in the course of the year, to use the reports
generated within the parliamentary system by the Budget committee as a
means for taking those discussions forward. The commitments we've made,
each one of us, in our Estimates of National Expenditure, the measurable
objectives we've stated, and Parliament has the right to know whether we're
living out those responsibilities.

So, in expressing appreciation for these debates that have happened, in
being bold enough to draw attention to the deficiencies in the way in which
there's been a lack of focus on the measurable objectives, I want to invite
Parliament, in the spirit and interests of democracy, to take forward what
is published, to appreciate the work that is being done by the Budget
committee and to ensure that Parliament can live out its oversight role,
not after the horse has bolted, but in here. Thank you very much.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

     Report of Delegation to 5th Session  of  African,  Caribbean,  Pacific-
     European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly, Brazzaville,  Republic  of
     Congo, 31 March - 3 April 2003:


     The African,  Caribbean,  Pacific-European  Union  Joint  Parliamentary
     Assembly (ACP-EU JPA) met as  scheduled  at  Brazzaville,  Republic  of
     Congo from March 31 to April 3 2003. As the meeting due  to  have  been
     held in the European Parliament in November 2002 did not take place for
     reasons explained in our last report, the meeting  in  Brazzaville  was
     styled the Fifth Session of the ACP-EU JPA. As usual this  session  was
     preceded by meetings of the ACP, of  the  Working  Group  on  Rules  of
     Procedure, and on this occasion by  inaugural  sessions  of  three  new
     Standing Committees - on Political Affairs,  on  Economic  Development,
     Finance and Trade and  on  Social  Affairs  and  the  Environment.  The
     delegation consisted of Dr Rob Davies and Ms Ntshadi Tsheole (ANC)  and
     Ms Berenice Sono (DA). We were accompanied by  Mr  Saul  Pelle  of  the
     South African Embassy to the EU in Brussels and Ms  Nosisi  Potelwa  of
     the South African Embassy in Kinshasa (who is responsible for relations
     with the Republic of the Congo). Other  staff  made  available  by  the
     embassy in Kinshasa provided logistical support.


     After the drama resulting in the failure to convene the JPA in Brussels
     last November, the Brazzaville meeting was a largely routine and fairly
     low-key occasion. Attendance on the part of  European  Parliamentarians
     was not good and, in fact, the European side  was  only  just  quorate.
     Apparently, there were clashes with other meetings of some of the  main
     groups in the European Parliament.  The  ACP  co-President,  Mr  Adrien
     Houngbedji, also did not attend due to elections in  Benin.  Mr  Angelo
     Beda of Sudan, one  of  the  ACP  vice  Presidents,  stood  in  for  Mr
     Houngbedji on this occasion.  Ms  Ntshadi  Tsheole  also  stood  in  as
     rapporteur for the Working Group on Rules of Procedure  for  Mr  Edgar-
     Yves Monnou, who was absent for the same reason.


     The convening of the Committees, which took place before the  convening
     of the plenary was largely procedural. We are  a  full  member  of  the
     Standing Committee on Economic  Development,  Finance  and  Trade.  The
     committees are due to  convene  for  their  first  substantial  working
     sessions in July. In order to avoid a re-run of the issue that  led  to
     the aborting of the November  2002  JPA  -  the  determination  of  the
     majority of European Parliamentarians to exclude certain members of the
     Zimbabwean delegation from the European Parliamentary  premises  -  the
     Committees will meet at ACP House in Brussels. Apparently for the  same
     reason a long-standing proposal that sessions of the JPA in  Europe  be
     held in the  capital  of  the  country  holding  the  rotating  Council
     Presidency will now be activated, and  the  next  session,  which  will
     probably take place between 13th and 16th  October  2003,  will  be  in
     Rome.


     The JPA coincided with  the  full  entry  into  force  of  the  Cotonou
     agreement on April 1st, following ratification by all  European  member
     states and sufficient ACP countries. Two ACP delegations that had still
     not ratified  were  denied  voting  rights  at  the  JPA  in  terms  of
     provisions of the agreement.


     The Brazzaville JPA also took place against the background of  the  US-
     led war on Iraq. Both  co-Presidents  referred  to  the  war  in  their
     opening speeches: Mr Beda of the ACP strongly condemned the US  assault
     while Ms Glenys Kinnock of the EU  side  spoke  in  much  more  subdued
     terms, calling for the humanitarian needs of the  Iraqi  people  to  be
     paramount. While there were strong feelings among  many  MEPs,  it  was
     evident that there were also sharp divisions on the  EU  side  on  this
     issue. We were informed that the European Parliament had, in fact, been
     unable to agree on any position on war on Iraq. Mindful  of  this,  the
     Joint Bureau agreed on a statement put to  the  JPA  at  the  start  of
     proceedings. This was very general, lamenting the loss of life  on  all
     sides. A moment of silence was also held. Many delegates, however, felt
     this was insufficient and the Bureau agreed to allow a debate. All  ACP
     participants and a large majority of MEPs who spoke in this debate were
     strongly against the invasion and occupation of Iraq. We took the floor
     to condemn the subordination  of  principles  of  multi-lateralism  and
     international law to an approach that ``might is right''. We called for
     support for the continuing struggle for multi-lateralism  and  for  the
     European Union to assert itself as a real alternative. We  also  called
     for vigilance to ensure  that  issues  in  ACP-EU  relations  were  not
     marginalized by real concerns about the reconstruction of Iraq. Ms  Maj
     Britt Theorin of Sweden gave an input arguing that the invasion was  an
     illegal action in terms of international law. Only Mr Martin Callan  of
     the British Conservatives spoke in favour of the war. It was agreed not
     to try to adopt a resolution - which would in any case have encountered
     procedural difficulties in terms of deadlines for tabling  resolutions.
     Instead, the JPA adopted a Declaration. The gist of this indicated that
     ``a large majority'' of the JPA ``considers the war against Iraq to  be
     in breach of international law'' and ``cannot be justified'', but  also
     noted that ``a small minority strongly opposes this view''.


     Reports on the Cotonou negotiations (largely dealt with in statements
     by Development Commissioner, Poul Nielson, the Greek Presidency and the
     ACP council as well as in follow up debates and questions) point to a
     number of unresolved procedural issues as well as substantive
     differences in a highly uneven and unequal negotiating process. The
     Cotonou agreement provides for the negotiations to begin with a process
     involving the EU and the whole of the ACP before breaking up into
     negotiations for regionally based Economic Partnership Agreements
     (EPAs) involving separate ACP sub-regions scheduled to begin in
     September 2003. The ACP has indicated that it wants the ``all ACP''
     phase to culminate in a framework agreement that would shape EPA
     negotiations (e.g. providing for a common approach to least developed
     countries) and preserve a degree of unity among the ACP. The EU,
     however, is much less keen on a substantial framework agreement and
     appears to be eager to embark on EPA negotiations with those ACP
     countries and regions that have indicated a readiness to begin. The
     issue of ACP unity is a critical one. Several speakers referred to the
     ``humpty dumpty'' nature of the ACP - once it is broken it will not be
     able to be put together again. Although there was more time available
     for discussion on the Cotonou and WTO negotiations than had been
     scheduled in Brussels, the delay in convening the Committees has meant
     that the JPA has yet to establish processes for systematic monitoring
     and engagement with these critical issues.


     An interesting bilateral issue reported to the JPA is that Cuba has
     applied to join Cotonou without any pre-conditions. Cuba, already a
     member of the Georgetown agreement constituting the ACP, had previously
     found itself facing strong demands from the EU on issues of multi-party
     democracy. Commissioner Nielson told the JPA that the Commission would
     recommend that the European Council agree to admit Cuba saying this
     would enhance the EU's cooperation programme and also create a basis
     for more effective political dialogue.


     Many of the draft resolutions on thematic issues were the same as those
     tabled at the abortive Brussels meeting and dealt with issues like the
     International Criminal Court, Nepad, WSSD, coffee, sugar, rice, tuna
     and monitoring the WTO negotiations (the latter tabled by ourselves).
     These resolutions were all passed with little difficulty.


     Resolutions on ACP regions and Europe (the latter focusing on floods
     and environmental management rather than political matters) were
     likewise fairly routine. The Zimbabwe question, however, was once again
     the subject of heated debate. The major European groups remained
     strongly critical of the Zimbabwean government and called for the firm
     application of EU sanctions against the country. A feature of the
     debate was that a minority of ACP delegations also joined in this
     criticism. They included delegates from Zambia and Botswana. The latter
     referred to a refugee center in his constituency, which he said was
     ``full to capacity'', and urged an investigation by SADC into the
     ``serious problems'' in Zimbabwe. Also notable in this respect was a
     strongly critical input from the representative of St Vincent and the
     Grenadines, who had been strongly supportive of the Zimbabwean
     government position at the Brussels meeting.


     Four different resolutions on Zimbabwe were finally put to the vote.
     One, tabled jointly by the European socialist and conservative groups,
     was strongly critical and called for an intensification of sanctions.
     Another tabled by the Greens, with support from some opposition
     delegates from ACP countries, was similar but somewhat softer. The
     Zimbabwean delegation alone tabled a resolution arguing that the
     difficulties facing the country were entirely the product of the
     failure by Britain to honour its Lancaster House commitments. The
     fourth resolution, tabled by the United left group, regretted that a
     lack of respect for joint decision making had led to the cancellation
     of the Brussels meeting, called for dialogue between ACP and EU on
     problems relating to democracy and human rights, acknowledged the land
     issue and called for efforts to ``break the deadlock'' in the political
     situation in Zimbabwe. We, along with most of the ACP, supported the
     last resolution but none commanded the majority in both houses
     necessary to be adopted - after different groups called for split votes
     on each of them. We did not speak in the debate, but after the EU
     President noted that the JPA had no position on Zimbabwe suggested that
     the matter be referred to the Political Affairs Committee for a
     thorough debate on the issues as well as possible ways to assist the
     people of Zimbabwe to promote development and democracy in their
     country. This suggestion appeared to command broad support.


     An interesting procedural issue arose during the debate on Zimbabwe. An
     opposition parliamentarian from Mozambique asked for the floor, and
     also signed one of the motions. The ACP co-chair ruled that he could
     speak if the leader of the Mozambique delegation agreed. The leader of
     their delegation said she had no objection if the rules provided for
     this, but the JPA should understand that he did not speak on behalf of
     the Mozambican delegation. This caused major confusion, which could not
     be resolved at the time. The role and status of opposition party
     members on ACP delegations, which have only one vote, has been referred
     to the Working Group on Rules of Procedure for further processing.


     On the Friday after the JPA, as we were waiting for the return flight,
     we crossed the river and visited Kinshasa. This enabled us to pay a
     courtesy call on the embassy, and also to visit the South African
     military contingent attached to the United Nations Mission to the DRC
     (Monuc). The visit to the Monuc contingent by parliamentarians was, we
     believe, much appreciated by the troops we were able to meet.


     The delegation feels, finally, obliged to make a brief comment on the
     original travel arrangements. We were initially sent via Luanda (with a
     16 hour stopover) and Ponte Noire. Until noticed by us, no visas were
     obtained for Angola. Ntshadi Tsheole and Berenice Sono found themselves
     hassled at Ponte Noire, where no arrangements had been made for
     receiving delegates to the JPA. This detour led to the two Members
     arriving late for the ACP plenary. We subsequently discovered that
     there are several direct flights both to Brazzaville and Kinshasa, and
     in fact returned on these routes. While we appreciate the need for
     Parliament to economise on air travel costs by using air miles, we
     would also urge that decisions on routing should also take account of
     conditions on the ground, and that sending delegations on such round
     about routes should be avoided if possible.
