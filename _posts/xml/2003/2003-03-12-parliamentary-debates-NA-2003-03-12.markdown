Ms T E Millin, accompanied by Ms S A Seaton and Ms L  R  Mbuyazi,  made  and
subscribed the solemn affirmation and took her seat.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, there has been an agreement that  questions
will not  take  precedence  today.  We  will  start  with  the  subject  for
discussion on the Order Paper, which is in the name of  the  Chief  Whip  of
the Majority Party on  the  peaceful  and  multilateral  resolution  of  the
situation in Iraq.

      THE PEACEFUL AND MULTILATERAL RESOLUTION OF THE SITUATION IN IRAQ

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  Deputy  President,
and hon members, as we meet, the drums of war are getting  louder,  but  the
orchestra of peace is also getting stronger. Therefore,  today's  debate  is
crucial.

The tense  discussions  in  the  UN  Security  Council  on  the  same  issue
underscore the fact that we are facing one  of  the  most  decisive  moments
impacting on the future of  humanity.  The  threat  to  multilateralism  and
international peace and security has never before confronted us so  sharply.
Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, has said:


  All around the globe, people  want  to  see  the  Iraqi  crisis  resolved
  peacefully. War would  cause  great  human  suffering;  it  may  lead  to
  regional instability and economic crisis.
If there is anybody who doubts the Secretary-General's warning, let me  give
some information on the consequences of the 1991 Gulf War. According  to  Dr
Singh, Unicef's senior representative in Iraq,


  ... in 1989, the literacy rate was more than  90%.  Iraq  had  reached  a
  stage where the basic indicators we use to measure the overall well-being
  of human beings were some of the best in the world.

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit,


  ... the Iraqi  welfare  state  was,  until  recently,  amongst  the  most
  comprehensive and generous in the Arab world.

Today, tragically, a  man-made  disaster  has  befallen  the  Iraqi  people.
According to a recent Unicef  report,  nearly  one  in  four  children  aged
between six and twelve do not attend school. Close to one  million  children
under the age of five suffer from  chronic  malnutrition.  Infant  mortality
today is more than double what it was at the end of the  1980s.  The  under-
five  mortality  rate  is  two-and-a-half  times  what  it  was   in   1989.
Preventable illnesses such as diarrhoea and respiratory  infections  account
for 70% of child deaths. There is an  increase  in  the  number  of  orphans
needing  state  assistance,  which  existing  institutions  are  unable   to
provide, and there has been a sharp increase in maternal mortality.

The Unicef report concluded that the basic causes include, inter  alia,  the
effects of two major  wars,  civil  strife,  over  a  decade  of  sanctions,
inadequate  resource   distribution,   poor   institutional   capacity   and
inadequate human resources. Dr Al-Ali, a cancer specialist, writes:


  Before the Gulf War, we had only  three  to  four  deaths  a  month  from
  cancer. Now it is 30 to 35 patients dying every month. We don't know  the
  precise source of contamination, because we are not allowed  to  get  the
  equipment to conduct a proper survey or to even test the excess level  of
  radiation in our bodies.

He goes on to say:


  The mushroom grows huge, and the fish in what was once a beautiful  river
  are inedible. Even the grapes in my garden have  mutated  and  cannot  be
  eaten.

Dr Aswadi, a paediatrician, says:


  What happened in Hiroshima is almost exactly the same here.  We  have  an
  increased  percentage  of  congenital  malformation,   an   increase   of
  malignancy, leukaemia and brain tumours

Professor Rokke, the US Army physicist responsible for  cleaning  up  Kuwait
after the last war said:


  I am like  many  people  in  southern  Iraq.  I  have  5  000  times  the
  recommended level of radiation in my body. Most of my team is now dead.

Professor Sikora, the chief of the cancer  programme  at  the  World  Health
Organisation, wrote:


  Requested radiotherapy equipment, chemotherapy drugs and  analgesics  are
  constantly blocked by the sanctions committee. There seems to be a rather
  ludicrous notion that such agents could be converted  into  chemical  and
  other weapons.

He went on to say:


  You get only little bits of drugs here and there, and so you cannot  have
  any planning. It's bizarre.

Dennis Halliday, who spent 34 years with the UN, resigned  in  1998  as  the
UN's Humanitarian Co-ordinator for Iraq in protest at  the  effects  of  the
embargo on the civilian population. He commented:


  I had been instructed to implement a policy that satisfied the definition
  of genocide ... The policy of economic sanctions is totally bankrupt.

I have only referred to some elements of the negative  consequences  of  war
and sanctions. I am sure that no right-thinking person  in  this  House  can
question the South African Government's responsibility to  find  a  peaceful
solution to Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  The  vast  majority  of
governments and people want to ensure that we  achieve  the  disarmament  of
Iraq peacefully through UN Security Council Resolution 1441.

The Pope and other religious leaders  have  consistently  said  that  a  war
against Iraq cannot be morally justified. The no-war position  is  supported
by the majority of humanity. This is  reflected  by  the  decisions  of  the
major multilateral organisations, inter alia, the EU summit, the AU  summit,
the League of Arab States summit, the  Organisation  of  Islamic  Conference
summit and, of course, the latest NAM summit.

The Secretary-General of the United Nations has warned:


  What will happen in Iraq will have serious implications for other  issues
  for many  years  to  come,  including  international  terrorism  and  the
  situations in  the  occupied  Palestinian  territories,  Afghanistan  and
  elsewhere. It has the potential of weakening the United Nations and  deep
  divisions will be sowed between nations and between peoples of  different
  religions.

In support of these correct positions, millions  of  people  throughout  the
world are engaged in unprecedented protests against  the  war.  A  few  days
ago, a petition against the war, signed by a million Americans,  was  handed
over to the USA Mission to the United Nations.

I read today in the newspapers that hon  Mr  Leon  wants  clarity  on  South
Africa's position. Let me once again try to give him  some  clarity  on  the
matter.  The  South  African   Government   strongly   supports   the   full
implementation of United Nations Security Council  Resolution  1441  on  the
elimination of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and all  our  activities
have had one purpose, and one purpose only:  To  try  to  convince  Iraq  to
provide its full co-operation on the implementation of the resolution.

I must stress that Resolution 1441 deals with weapons of  mass  destruction.
It is not about fighting terrorism or so-called regime change.

To achieve these objectives, I  recently  visited  eight  countries  in  the
region, and held substantial discussions with leaders  of  those  countries.
In February this year, I led a delegation to Iraq to share  our  experiences
and approach to disarmament. This  was  my  third  visit  in  the  last  few
months. During our visit, we met all the top  Iraqi  personnel  involved  in
the  weapons  of  mass  destruction  programmes.  We  had  full  and   frank
discussions, and much information and  documentation  was  provided  to  our
delegation.

The latest report of Dr Blix and Dr El Baradei to the UN  Security  Council,
which I  will  refer  to  later,  coincides,  in  large  measure,  with  the
evaluation of the South African delegation. Our delegation  focused  on  the
need to provide fully transparent and proactive co-operation. We  encouraged
the Iraqi delegation  to  substantively  address  outstanding  issues.  Iraq
requested South African assistance in validating their proposed  methodology
in  trying  to  prove  that  they  have  destroyed  their  VX  and   anthrax
stockpiles. We are presently considering this request.

The Iraqi experts informed us  that  the  outstanding  problems  surrounding
Iraq's nuclear weapons programmes should not  be  insurmountable,  and  that
these issues are being dealt with substantively with the IAEA inspectors.

The  South  African  and  Iraqi  delegations  also   discussed   the   issue
surrounding the Al-Samud II missiles, and we pointed out to them the  urgent
necessity  of  the  destruction  of  the   Al-Samud   II   missiles.   Other
difficulties being experienced  with  regard  to  the  verification  of  the
destruction of Iraq's former  missile  programmes  were  also  substantively
discussed. The South African delegation also underlined  the  importance  of
the adoption of Iraqi legislation prohibiting weapons  of  mass  destruction
and their delivery systems. We provided the Iraqis with South  Africa's  own
national legislation and regulations in this regard.

The Iraqi delegation  informed  us  that  they  had  provided  nine  reports
recently to the inspectors which would deal substantially with some  of  the
outstanding issues. They also briefed us on the massive campaign  to  coerce
or  bribe  top  Iraqi  officials,  politicians,   military   officials   and
scientists to defect to the West. In their  understanding,  this  influences
their position on the requests for interviews to be granted abroad.

In my speech during the debate  on  the  President's  state  of  the  nation
address, I quoted exclusively from Dr Blix and Dr El  Baradei's  reports  to
the UN Security Council on 14 February 2003 to try  to  indicate  that  some
progress was being made. The most recent  reports  of  Dr  Blix  and  Dr  El
Baradei on 7 March 2003 indicate that, now, substantially good  progress  is
being made. According to Dr Blix, difficulties about helicopters and  aerial
surveillance planes operating in the no-fly zones  have  been  overcome.  In
the last month, Iraq has provided the names  of  many  persons  who  may  be
relevant sources of information.  Intelligence  authorities  previously  had
claimed that weapons of mass destruction are moved around  Iraq  by  trucks,
in  particular,  that  they  are  mobile  production  units  for  biological
weapons.  Several  inspections  have  taken  place,  and  no   evidence   of
proscribed activities have so far been found. The Iraqi side denied  reports
that proscribed activities are conducted underground. According to Dr  Blix,
no underground facilities for chemical or biological production  or  storage
have been found so far.

He goes on to say:


  As of today, there is more tangible progress. Iraq has accepted that  the
  Al-Samud II missiles and associated items be destroyed, and  has  started
  the process of destruction under our supervision.

According to him:


  This constitutes a substantial measure of  disarmament.  More  papers  on
  anthrax, VX  and  missiles  have  recently  been  provided.  There  is  a
  significant  Iraqi  effort  under  way  to  clarify  a  major  source  of
  uncertainty as to the quantities  of  biological  and  chemical  weapons,
  which were unilaterally destroyed in 1991.

He says:


  One can hardly avoid the impression  that  after  a  period  of  somewhat
  reluctant co-operation, there has been  an  acceleration  of  initiatives
  from the Iraqi side since the end of January.

UNMOVIC is currently drafting the work  programme  which  will  contain  our
proposed list of key remaining  disarmament  tasks.  It  will  describe  the
reinforced  system  of  ongoing  monitoring  and   verification.   He   says
correctly:


  Disarmament and verification cannot be instant. It will take months.

Similarly, the report of Dr El Baradei on  the  nuclear  programme  is  very
positive, and he goes on to say that excellent progress has been  made,  and
all the outstanding issues that had been raised  and  the  allegations  made
about enriched  uranium,  aluminium  tubes  and  about  the  acquisition  of
magnets have all been found to be incorrect. Indeed, on  the  issue  of  the
accusation that Iraq  and  Niger  had  a  treaty  or  agreement  on  uranium
acquisition, it has been found that this document is not  authentic.  It  is
false and, therefore, he has disregarded the document.

Given all this, the question we must  all  answer  is:  Do  the  two  latest
reports not indicate substantial success? I want to believe  that  the  vast
majority of humanity believes it does.

The  issue  of  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass  destruction   has   brought   the
international   community   generally,   and   the   UN   Security   Council
specifically, to a dangerous level  of  division  and  tension.  In  the  UN
Security Council, there are two opposing positions:  One,  the  position  of
the United States, Britain and  Spain  arguing  that  Iraq  is  in  material
breach of Resolution 1441, and that March 17 should be  the  final  deadline
before sanctioning war. This is supported by Bulgaria.

On the other side, there is  the  position  of  France,  Russia  and  China,
supported by Germany and Syria, arguing that the inspections  are  producing
results, and the inspectors should be given an extension to  complete  their
work. Yesterday, the British apparently made a compromise proposal that  the
timetable should be extended to the end of March. With regard  to  the  non-
permanent  members,  the  three  African  countries,  Angola,  Cameroon  and
Guinea, and  the  two  Latin  American  countries,  Chile  and  Mexico,  are
undecided.

We are aware that they are under tremendous pressure. It  is  reported  that
some countries have proposed a time extension of 45 days.  We  believe  that
any timetable must take into account the work programme  of  the  inspectors
and must avoid any ultimatum for war. We sincerely hope that the AU and  NAM
member countries who are in the UN Security Council will  be  influenced  by
the AU and NAM resolutions.

President Mbeki recently stated:


  Our obligation to defend what we stand for requires that we reassert  and
  vigorously  defend  our  commitment  to  the   peaceful   resolution   of
  international conflict.


  It demands of us that we do everything we can to protect and advance  the
  principle and practice of multilateralism. This requires  that  we  fight
  even harder for  the  democratisation  of  the  international  system  of
  governance ... This requires  that  we  respect  the  decisions  we  take
  collectively.

He goes on to say:


  Let it not be said of us, as Yeats said:


     The best lack all conviction while the worst  are  full  of  passionate
     intensity.
The NAM summit concluded that the rich and powerful exercise  an  inordinate
influence  in  determining  the  nature  and  direction   of   international
relations. Will the UN Security Council respond to the  voice  of  the  vast
majority of people in the world? The United  Nations  was  founded  to  save
humanity from the scourge of war. Its responsibilities demand that  it  seek
a peaceful resolution of conflicts. The outcome of  the  debate  in  the  UN
Security Council would have a defining influence on  how  the  international
community addresses conflict situations and major problems  in  the  future.
This is an extremely serious issue which needs  our  careful  consideration,
and will have far-reaching implications. The objectives of the  founders  of
the United Nations to prevent war must be central to our deliberations.

As I have indicated, according to the  latest  reports,  however  belatedly,
there is now substantial co-operation from the Iraqi government. Some  argue
that this would not have happened without a credible show of  force,  and  a
real threat of the use of such force. Whatever the reasons, Iraq is now  co-
operating, and  progress  is  being  made.  The  UN  Security  Council  must
capitalise on this.

What happens in Iraq will have unprecedented consequences for  other  issues
in the region and the world. The conflict between the Palestinians  and  the
Israelis will  get  worse,  and  a  solution  will  become  more  difficult.
Furthermore, it will make it more  difficult  to  deal  with  other  serious
issues such as North Korea, the Cote d'Ivoire, the DRC and Burundi.  If  the
UN Security Council is divided  over  Iraq,  how  will  the  United  Nations
collectively and successfully  tackle  other  challenges,  inter  alia,  the
scourge of terrorism, underdevelopment, poverty and HIV/Aids?

Today  some  countries,  the  so-called  `coalition  of  the  willing',  are
threatening to act outside a UN Security Council mandate. We agree with  the
Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, that if countries  act  outside  the  council
and take military action, it would not be in conformity with the UN  Charter
and the legitimacy of their actions will be questioned. Some  British  legal
experts even believe that UK troops fighting without UN  sanction  could  be
accused of committing war crimes.

It is my belief that any action outside the UN Security  Council  will  also
signal the absolute weakening if not the destruction of the  United  Nations
system and its institutions. Dennis Halliday, a humanitarian in Iraq said:


  The longer the sanctions go on,  the  more  we  are  likely  to  see  the
  emergence of a generation who will regard Hussein as too moderate and too
  willing to listen to the West.

This demands that we must  succeed  in  peacefully  implementing  Resolution
1441, and we must urgently move to end the sanctions regime against Iraq.

Given this reality, and the dangerous consequences of war, and the  reported
progress of the inspectors, is war necessary? Billions say  ``no''.  I  hope
in this House we hear the anguished voices of  billions,  and  unite  around
the slogan: ``Disarmament - yes, war - no''.  [Applause.]  This  is  in  our
national interest, which I believe coincides with humanity's  interests.  If
we fail, we will have to answer the question  posed  by  the  poet  Langston
Hughes:


  What happens to a dream deferred?
  Does it dry up
  like a raisin in the sun?
  Or fester like a sore ...
  Does it stink like rotten meat ...
  Or does it explode?

The  dreams  of  billions  must  not  be  deferred,  because  who  wants  an
explosion? Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L ZITA: Madam Speaker, today is yet another  occasion  for  us  as  South
Africans to make known our stance on the imminent unilateral US-led  war  on
Iraq. It is again one of those moments when we are called  upon  to  declare
our stand as a nation and  as  a  people  on  one  of  the  most  disturbing
features  of  the  twenty-first  century,  the  emergence  of  the   violent
unipolarity of United States of America.

Thirteen years ago,  the  Soviet  Union  disappeared.  For  many,  this  was
portrayed as the end of that period in history. Many  anticipated  the  rise
of a world based on the foundation of democracy and human rights as well  as
the onset of a dialogical pursuit of national  interests  in  a  polycentric
world. Today we can say that such a view was  an  illusion  whose  time  has
come to pass.

In defining our standpoint  on  this  matter  of  profound  gravity,  it  is
important that we clarify our premises. As South Africans, we are not  anti-
America.  We  are  a  country  that  has  had  a  lasting  relationship  and
friendship with the United  States  of  America  which  dates  back  to  the
experience of Pixley Seme, one of the founding leaders of the  ANC,  at  the
beginning of the last century. It is a relationship that  has  been  further
developed since the advent of democracy in our own country.

What we are opposed to is not the United States of  America  but  its  plan,
not only to unilaterally go to war with Iraq, but its  stated  designs  both
to change the regime in Iraq as well as to redraw, in its interest, the  map
of the Middle East. This is an issue that all progressives are  opposed  to,
including the former US president, Jimmy Carter. In an opinion piece in  the
New York Times he writes,


  As a Christian and as a president  who  has  severely  been  provoked  by
  international crises, I became thoroughly familiar with the principles of
  a just war. It is clear that a substantial unilateral attack on Iraq does
  not meet these standards.

Our second premise is our opposition to  all  dictatorships,  including  the
dictatorship of Saddam Hussein over the people of Iraq.  Our  opposition  to
the US-led war is not in defence of Saddam Hussein. It is in  defence  of  a
principle. It is in defence of the right of nations  to  self-determination.
[Interjections.] It is our opposition to all forms of  aggression  on  other
countries by anyone, no matter how powerful such aggressors are.

Our third premise is  that  we  condemn  all  forms  of  terrorism.  On  the
occasion of the 11 September attack we, as South Africa,  joined  the  world
in expressing our disgust of the terrorist attack on innocent civilians.  We
do not believe that a war on Iraq will make the world a place that  is  safe
from terrorism. In fact, it is our contention that a war on Iraq will  serve
as a convenient platform for all those  who  seek  to  present  a  case  for
belligerence in the Arab world against infidels.

Our fourth premise  is  our  agreement  with  all  progressive  nations  and
peoples that we have to put an end to all weapons of  mass  destruction.  No
nation, the United States of America  included,  should  own  such  weapons.
[Applause.] Our call against war is not a defence for Iraq to amass  nuclear
weapons. We are merely saying, together with billions of  others  the  world
over, that a UN initiative for disarming Iraq is in place.  If  there  is  a
problem  of  capacity,  tempo  and  process,  those  should  be   addressed.
Unilateralism is not the answer.

We are opposed to a unilateral war on Iraq because, in many ways,  it  is  a
telling statement to the US government to re-examine  its  conduct  and  the
criteria for defining its national interest. Saddam Hussein as  well  as  Al
Qaeda's Osama Bin Laden were, at some point in their lives,  allies  of  the
US. It is now time that this  narrow  definition  of  national  interest  be
reviewed in favour of a genuine policy that is underpinned by  a  commitment
to democracy and democratic rights.

We are opposed to this war because it  is  a  continuation  of  a  dangerous
trend - the continued undermining by the  US  of  legitimate  structures  of
global governance. It is difficult for us  to  ignore  the  observations  by
George Monbiot of the Guardian Weekly that  in  pursuit  of  its  interests,
particularly of those of its powerful constituencies, the US government  has
already rendered the World Trade Organisation unworkable and is now bent  on
doing the same to the UN.
Monbiot writes, I quote,


  Last month President Bush warned the UN Security Council that accepting a
  new resolution authorising a war on Iraq was its last chance to prove its
  relevance ...

He continues:


  Earlier, a leaked document  from  the  Pentagon  shows  that  this  final
  opportunity might already have passed.

He detects a  link  between  the  $60  million  support  from  the  chemical
industry for the mid-term  election  victory  by  the  republicans  and  the
present attempt by the US to scupper  commitments  made  at  Doha  for  easy
access to drugs by developing countries.

If indeed there is such a link, are we out of place when we  ask  ourselves:
who is to benefit from the destruction of Iraq?  Is  this  war  not  just  a
smokescreen to oil the profits of American corporates  in  the  defence  and
oil industries? This indeed seems to be the  case,  as  US  journalist  Mark
Tran reports  that  US  engineering  companies  have  already  been  awarded
contracts for the post-war reconstruction  of  Iraq.  One  such  company  is
Kellogg Brown and Root, an oil service company in which  US  Vice  President
Dick Cheney was chief executive from 1995 to 2000. Is this the  real  reason
behind the war?

As South Africans, we call for a peaceful disarmament of Iraq. We  call  for
the strengthening of the global mobilisation against the war.  We  call  for
the stabilisation and democratisation of the  Middle  East  and  the  speedy
resolution of the Palestinian question.

Lastly, the present crisis reflects the urgency of the  need  to  strengthen
the institutions for democratic global governance. [Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Madam Speaker, as you are  aware,  about  ten  days  ago,  the
Chief Whip of the Opposition read on my behalf a question in the  debate  in
this House. In particular,  it  was  started  off  by  the  Deputy  Minister
reporting on his mission to Baghdad, which was  highly  topical  because  he
had already made some statements in Baghdad. I did that  partly  because  it
was an important mission, and partly because, quite frankly,  I  would  like
to establish a precedent that when  important  missions  are  undertaken  by
Ministers, or even the President, on behalf of the country, in a  relatively
short space afterwards, those people should return to Parliament and  report
to Parliament. Then a discussion can take place where the  public  is  fully
aware, and one  doesn't  have  to  wait  for  months  and  months  before  a
discussion can take place on a matter of serious importance which  is  being
conducted on behalf of the Government by a Minister. [Applause.]

It may be necessary to change the Rules, but I think that the concept of  an
extended committee of the House, with the same general rules that  apply  at
the committee stage in the portfolio committees, could  well  apply  in  the
House on these important matters. I believe it  will  help  the  public  and
Parliament to be informed; it would sensitise the executive to the  need  of
accountability, and it would allow the proceedings of Parliament  to  become
more topical and more relevant than they are today.

I was hoping that  we  were  going  to  have  a  discussion  on  the  Deputy
Minister's mission to Baghdad. I was rather  surprised  when  we  were  told
that six very prominent South African citizens  with  a  scientific  Armscor
background would be going to Baghdad. I then found  out  that  their  leader
was none other than Mr Essop Pahad, who has no knowledge of  the  scientific
disposal of weapons of mass destruction. But, nevertheless, he  went  there.
[Interjections.]

When the Deputy Minister concluded his mission, he  made  a  statement,  and
then he answered some questions. A number of these  questions  need  further
questions to be answered.


  First of all, he said:


  ...  we  appreciate  our  interaction  with  the  team  where  full   and
  transparent discussions were held.  There  was  no  issue  that  was  not
  discussed. Issues included key areas of nuclear, biological and  chemical
  programmes.

Against the background of frank, open discussions, a simple question to  the
Deputy Minister is: Does he believe that Iraq in fact possesses  weapons  of
mass destruction or not? What has happened with Iraq? That was the  core  of
going over there. Against this background, he says:


  No, no. It is difficult to make any assessment in this  regard.  We  have
  carefully  studied  the  reports  of  the  inspectors  and  have   raised
  outstanding issues ... The answers to these questions have been  provided
  in our interactions.

But there is no answer to the question: What did you find out about  weapons
of mass destruction?

Secondly, he went on, quite correctly, piggybacking on  President  De  Klerk
who started the process of disarming the  weapons  of  mass  destruction  in
1993. Nevertheless, he says:


  Confidence  in  the  destruction  of  South  Africa's  weapons  of   mass
  destruction was based on a political decision to  be  fully  transparent,
  and to co-operate fully and to build confidence.

Did you in fact find out that this is happening in Iraq?


  No, ...

he said,


  ... I said it is difficult  to  say  because  I  haven't  spoken  to  the
  inspectors.

And so, you can go on and on and on.

He went there but there are evasions, and more evasions.  When  in  Baghdad,
he said, they were given very important secret and sensitive  information  -
often for the first time - and that this information is  going  to  be  very
useful because it will enable them to help the Iraqi government. I  want  to
say this: If you have  to  use  sensitive  information  to  help  the  Iraqi
government, you have an equal responsibility, as a  member  of  the  UN,  to
help  its  inspectors  by  making  this  information  available   to   them.
[Applause.] I am just telling  you  that  you  can't  say  you  have  secret
information and that you want to  help  one  side.  You  have,  in  fact,  a
commitment to helping the other side as well.

We are living in traumatic times.  Already  the  world  is  divided  and  is
poised on the brink of war - with all its death, destruction, human  tragedy
and its vast unpredictable consequences for people and mankind.  And  as  we
sit here today  and  have  a  kind  of  almost  pleasant  and  exciting  but
inconsequential debate, 15 people are sitting  in  New  York  -  at  the  UN
Security Council - to make a decision which is going to affect the lives  of
all of us, not only here, but around the world.

What  are  they  considering?  Firstly,  they  are  going  to  consider   UN
Resolution 1441. That resolution is very clear in  what  it  says.  It  says
that the Iraqi government of 4 November 2002 was deemed to be  a  danger  to
the peace of the world. [Interjections.] This resolution  was  supported  by
all countries and our present Government. Secondly, it  says  ``...  without
delay, all the weapons of mass destruction must be removed.''  And  thirdly,
it says the Iraqi government must co-operate with the  inspectorate  in  its
verification of this process.

Among the first things that they have to consider - we can shout and  scream
- is whether this resolution is being complied with or  to  what  extent  it
has been complied with. All the other reasons are irrelevant.

Furthermore, they are going to ask what decisions they will have to make  as
a consequence of their discussions on their  findings.  Once  again,  it  is
quite clear that they are going to  have  to  take  some  decisions,  either
that, in fact, the process is continuing or collapsing,  or  that  something
else has got to be put in its place. And thirdly,  they  are  going  to  ask
what the framework is within which they have got to  take  their  decisions.
They have got to take that within the framework of the UN  Charter  and  its
Articles 39, 41 and 42.

 Article 39 says you have to declare that there is a threat to the peace  of
the world. Article 41 says you have to try to use means other than  the  use
of force to try to achieve the objective. And Article 42 says  that  if  you
find that that is impossible, you are entitled to use force. So,  they  have
to look at this. [Interjections.]

An Hon MEMBER: Where does it say you should use force?

Mr C W EGLIN: I said it says ``you are entitled to use force''. It says:


  Should the Security  Council  consider  that  measures  provided  for  in
  Article 41 would be inadequate or prove to be  inadequate,  it  may  take
  such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary  to  maintain
  and restore international peace. [Interjections.]

That is the quotation. Mr Chairman, let's get our  position  clear  on  this
because this is not a rough-and-tumble debate.  This  is  a  very  important
debate about the future of mankind.

There are three things. The one thing on which the Minister was  correct  is
that the UN Security Council  is  not  considering  what  is  now  known  as
``regime change''. I want to make it very clear that I think  in  fact  that
Iraq could be in a better position and the world would  be  safer  if  there
was a regime change in Iraq. But that is not the issue. I want  to  make  it
quite clear that our belief if that any unilateral decision to go to war  to
achieve regime change in Iraq, or for that  matter  in  any  other  country,
would herald a new era, not based on international law but on  international
anarchy. That is our clear view on that matter.

Secondly, our view, and I said it in the debate on  4  March  2003,  on  the
issue ofÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Interjections.] If the  debate  had  gone  according  to  my
schedule, I wouldn't have to retire at all!

We have made it quite clear that any decision to  find  a  solution  to  the
Iraqi  issue  on  the  weapons   of   mass   destruction   must   be   taken
multilaterally, and it must be based on the UN Charter and on the tenets  of
international law. I am reading from my Hansard of 5 November 2002:


  Military  action  without  the  sanction  or  outside  the  framework  of
  international law are bound to have far-reaching consequences, not  least
  of which could be the polarisation of the international community or  the
  undermining of the fragile unity that has been created around the concept
  of combating terrorism.

Thirdly, the UN Security Council has got a third decision to  make:  It  has
to see that the provisions of Resolution 1441 are  implemented.  They  can't
duck that one; it is their responsibility. All we say  is  that  we  believe
that we should support the UN Security Council in whatever its decision  is.

As we have said, we hope that it will not  come  to  a  stage  when  the  UN
Security Council would consider it necessary to authorise the use of  force.
But, taking into account that on 11 occasions in the last 12  years  it  has
authorised the use of force, it is  possible  it  will  use  force.  And  we
believe it should follow, as far as it can,  the  route  of  peace.  But  it
cannot say in advance that it will not apply Article 42  of  the  convention
because it would actually emasculate the authority  of  the  UN.  You  would
actually say you are going to take away from  the  very  provisions  of  ...
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, I have listened  with  amusement  to  the
manner in which the hon Mr  Eglin  has  attacked  the  Deputy  Minister  for
visiting Baghdad. The manner in which the Deputy Minister  reacted  reminded
me of the Afrikaans saying:

Hy het 'n klip in die bos gegooi en die jakkals het getjank. [Applous.]  [He
threw a stone into the bush and the fox howled.]]

The biggest mistake we could ever make is to underestimate the  consequences
of a war in Iraq. But similarly the biggest mistake we could  ever  make  is
to underestimate the consequences if  Iraq  in  fact  has  weapons  of  mass
destruction and uses them at some moment in the future.

Which side do we choose? Do we choose Bush or Saddam Hussein?

The simple truth is: One is struck by uncertainty  as  demonstrated  by  the
Deputy Minister, by confusion and the inability to uncover the truth.  There
are too many vitally important questions to which there  are  no  convincing
answers. To mention but a few:  Would  President  Bush  and  Prime  Minister
Blair  start  a  bloody  war  if  they  think  that  war  can  be   avoided?
[Interjections.] Does  President  Hussein  in  fact  hide  weapons  of  mass
destruction? Yes or no? [Interjections.] Will Dr Blix ever be able  to  find
the needles in the haystack? [Interjections.]

 The Deputy Minister said  that  we  should  say  no  to  war,  but  yes  to
disarmament. I agree with you but it  is  an  oversimplification  because  I
want to ask the Minister: What happens if Saddam Hussein  does  not  disarm?
[Interjections.] No, I do not want to go  there.  You  have  got  Pik  Botha
going there. What should I do there? And Winnie!

The Iraq issue has split the world into various opposing camps. Millions  of
people are taking to the  streets  to  object  to  the  war.  Many  millions
support the war. Some countries say that war is inevitable. Others  say  war
is necessary.

In my opinion, the whole Iraqi question hinges on but  one  vital  question:
Does President  Hussein  have  weapons  of  mass  destruction,  yes  or  no?
[Interjections.] If you know, why does Dr Blix not know? Have  you  been  to
Iraq? Have you looked at everything? [Laughter.]

If President Hussein has those weapons and does not want  to  destroy  them,
then war seems to be inevitable. On the other hand,  if  he  does  not  have
them, then war is,  of  course,  not  necessary.  It  is  around  this  very
question that world opinion is totally split. In fact,  the  opposite  views
are so strongly voiced that we are  witnessing  an  international  political
arena undergoing a historic and fundamental change. To  mention  but  a  few
almost unbelievable examples of how the  world  is  divided  over  the  Iraq
issue: Countries such as Britain and Spain and France who fought  two  world
wars together are now in opposite camps. France and  Germany  on  the  other
hand are countries who fought each other in two world wars, and are  now  in
the same bed. The  African  Union  opposes  the  war.  Spain,  Bulgaria  and
Australia are in favour of the war. The Non-Aligned  Movement  opposes  war.
The United States and many others are in  favour  of  war.  Some  are  still
undecided. The Iraq issue has torn the world apart. [Interjections.]

In fact, a huge and ominous cloud ... why does that member not ask his  Whip
for a turn to speak here? You probably do not get  a  turn  to  speak  here,
because you will only  talk  nonsense.  [Laughter.]  In  fact,  a  huge  and
ominous cloud of approaching disaster is covering the world, be it  the  war
or be it the use of weapons of mass destruction  by  President  Hussein.  In
fact, the four horsemen of the Apocalypse may soon be out, preparing to  run
the bloody path of war, or  the  equally  bloody  path  of  the  unthinkable
results of weapons of mass destruction.

This debate may well in future be classified as the most  important  one  in
the new South Africa. The Deputy Minister called it a  crisis,  because  the
war may start within a few days.

The main question which we as the  public  representatives  of  millions  of
South Africans today have to seriously address is: Where does  South  Africa
position   itself   in   relation   to   this   approaching   disaster   ...
[Interjections] ... whether the approaching disaster is war  or  whether  it
is the effects of weapons of mass destruction?  We  have  but  one  duty  of
paramount importance: The interest of  our  country  South  Africa  and  our
citizens. We must be guided by this principle and by no other motivation.

Clearly, South Africa's best interest is served  by  avoiding  war  in  Iraq
and, even more so, by destroying weapons of mass destruction  if  they  were
to be found.

The consequences of the war will be disastrous, as the Deputy  Minister  has
pointed out. The consequences of the proliferation of the  weapons  of  mass
destruction will be equally disastrous. At the same time, the  self-interest
of South Africa should be our guiding light in this  crisis.  We  must  also
acknowledge that stopping the war in  Iraq  should  preferably  be  obtained
through multilateral means. Similarly, if Iraq  possesses  weapons  of  mass
destruction, their dismantling should also preferably  be  achieved  through
multilateral means.

The remaining big question, which the Deputy Minister did  not  answer,  is:
What will South Africa's position be if the United States and  its  partners
ignore the  United  Nations  and  start  the  war?  [Interjections.]  It  is
obviously a huge  problem  with  numerous  factors  to  be  considered.  The
dubious track record of President Saddam Hussein is but one factor. So  also
the constant discovery of items of war.

I pity Dr Blix, because how is he to  find  the  needles  in  the  haystack?
[Interjections.]  If  President  Hussein  in  fact  has  weapons   of   mass
destruction, he is certainly going to hide them so  well  that  no  Dr  Blix
will find them. [Interjections.] The hon Deputy Minister  appears  to  trust
Saddam Hussein. President Bush and many others, on the other  hand,  do  not
trust him.

In conclusion, it is clear that the world is caught in a type of  catch  22-
situation. The consequences  of  both  decisions  will  be  disastrous.  The
appropriate road ahead seems to be to watch every  single  development  very
carefully every day and continuously keep in contact with all  role-players.
We, from our side, pray that our leaders will have the  wisdom  -  and  that
includes the Deputy Minister - and the courage to take the  right  decisions
at the right moment in the best interest of our land and all  its  citizens.
We wish you well and we hope you take the right decision. [Applause.]
Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, the hon Koos van der  Merwe  said:  The  war
may start within a few days. Unfortunately, that is a possibility that  this
House will have to deal with timeously.

Die  Nuwe  NP  se  standpunt  oor  die  naderende  oorlog  teen   Irak   bly
onveranderd. Irak  moet  voldoen  aan  alle  VN-vereistes  oor  ontwapening,
insluitende  dié  van  resolusie  1441.  Doen   hy   dit   nie,   moet   die
Veiligheidsraad en nie die VSA op  sy  eie  nie,  strafmaatreëls  teen  Irak
instel wat selfs militêre optrede kan insluit, in terme van artikel  43  van
die VN-handves.

Ongelukkig gaan die vraag nie meer vandag  daaroor  of  die  VSA  Irak  moet
binneval of nie. Die harde werklikheid is - en  ek  ondersteun  nie  hierdie
standpunt nie - die VSA gaan Irak aanval, ongeag wat  die  wapenverslag  van
die inspekteurs sê. Die VSA gaan Irak aanval ondanks die feit dat  Frankryk,
Rusland en China hulle vetoreg  gaan  gebruik  om  so  'n  aanval  te  keer.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The New NP's position on the impending war against Iraq remains  unchanged.
Iraq must meet all  UN  requirements  on  disarmament,  including  those  of
Resolution 1441. If it does not do this, the Security Council  and  not  the
USA on its own, must institute punitive measures  against  Iraq,  which  can
even include military action, in terms of section 43 of the UN Charter.

Unfortunately, today the question  is  no  longer  whether  the  USA  should
invade Iraq. The hard reality is - and I do not support this position -  the
USA is going to attack Iraq, irrespective of what the weapons report of  the
inspectors says. The USA is going to  attack  Iraq  despite  the  fact  that
France, Russia and China are going to use their veto power to  prevent  such
an attack.]

Unfortunately, the USA has reached a point of no return. They say that  once
you have drawn your sword you have to use it. [Interjections.]  Perhaps  the
USA drew its sword too soon. Fact is, if they back  down  now,  it  will  be
interpreted by rogue states and organisations such as Northern Korea and Al-
Qaeda as a sign of weakness; it will  create  a  perception  that  the  only
superpower  in  the  world  is  nothing  more  than  a  paper  tiger,   with
devastating consequences for the safety of the free world.

The only thing that can stop the US attack on Iraq, however,  is  if  Saddam
Hussein goes into exile, as proposed by the  leaders  of  the  Gulf  States.
[Interjections.] It is not my proposal. It is the proposal  of  the  leaders
of the Gulf States.  Perhaps  the  South  African  Government  should,  once
again, raise this possibility with Saddam Hussein. I  want  to  repeat:  The
question whether the US should attack Iraq in order to  disarm  them  is  no
longer relevant. The US will attack Iraq and  the  only  relevant  remaining
question is: What will South Africa's position be when the US attacks  Iraq,
with or without UN consent?

The only sensible thing for South Africa to do will be to  stay  neutral  at
all  times.  [Interjections.]  If  we  want  to  sign  our   death   warrant
economically, then we must openly come out on  the  side  of  Iraq.  In  the
field of international diplomacy there is no such  thing  as  friends,  only
interests. It will not be in South Africa's national interest to  side  with
Iraq in a case of war. The best option for South  Africa  will  be  to  stay
neutral at all times. It seems, however, as if a position - I will  come  to
the issue of a principle - of neutrality is not self-evident.

When it was suggested by the New NP during the debate on the  state  of  the
nation address that economic  factors,  such  as  US  investments  in  South
Africa and benefits flowing from the  African  Growth  and  Opportunity  Act
should be considered before openly siding with Iraq in case of war,  it  was
slated by the hon President in his reply as an unprincipled  position.  Then
there was the letter from the South African Government  to  Saddam  Hussein,
handed to him personally by none other than  the  Deputy  Minister  himself.
Rumour has it that it was in fact a letter of support  for  Saddam  Hussein.
[Interjections.] It will be appreciated if the  hon  Deputy  Minister  could
cast more light on the content of that letter.

Iraq is thousands of kilometres away from South  Africa  and  America's  war
should  not  automatically  become  South  Africa's  war.  The  previous  NP
government  had  a  not-too-pleasant  experience  in  this  regard.  The  US
encouraged South Africa to invade Angola and then left us high and dry  when
they withdrew the promised back-up support. [Interjections.]  Regardless  of
that, the US remains the only superpower in the world and it would be  plain
foolish to side with an opponent of theirs who, in any case,  falls  in  the
same category as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.

Humanitarian aid to the civilian population of Iraq,  who  will  become  the
main victims of the war, is the right thing to do and should be  encouraged.
Support for the regime, however, will be a fatal diplomatic blunder  to  the
detriment of South Africa's national interest. The time  has  come  for  the
South African Government to say in no uncertain terms  what  South  Africa's
position will be  in  the  case  of  a  US  attack  on  Iraq,  warranted  or
unwarranted. We anxiously await the reply of  the  hon  Deputy  Minister  in
this regard. [Applause.]
Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, multilateralism as an  instrument  of  conflict
resolution in the world remains fundamental  and  central  to  regional  and
world peace. Its evolution and conceptualisation  in  the  ruins  and  ashes
that marked the end of the  great  war  undergirded  the  formation  of  the
League  of  Nations  in  1919.  The  compromise   of   this   principle   of
multilateralism thereafter caused the demise of  the  league  and  could  be
linked to the rise of Nazism and the events that triggered the Second  World
War.

In 1946, after the defeat of Nazism, the victors launched the UN, hoping  it
would succeed where the league had failed. This organisation was  buttressed
by numerous organs, specialised to target several aspects  of  national  and
international concern, which are pertinent to war and peace and which  would
assist the United Nations in carrying out its mandate of  maintaining  world
peace.

Peace has always been elusive because some governments and the cliques  they
serve are guided by self-interest in their ordering  of  national,  regional
and international priorities. It takes  extraordinary  leadership  qualities
for a leader and his government to subject personal and sectarian  interests
to those of the greater community, the  nation  and  the  world.  Individual
super states have consistently fermented, funded and equipped limited  local
wars scattered all over the globe in pursuit of esoteric  agendas.  This  is
true of the US in several theatres of war over many decades.

At this moment as we speak, the world is perilously poised on the  brink  of
an apocalypse whose tragic consequences  cannot  be  fathomed  and  will  be
visited on the innocent, poor, illiterate and voiceless majority who  cannot
begin to comprehend the cause and make any sense of  the  devastation  being
perpetrated ostensibly on their behalf.

President Bush, in his  anti-terrorist  crusade  and  mission  to  apprehend
Osama Bin Laden, woke up one day convinced that this latter monstrosity  had
metamorphosed and assumed the face of Saddam Hussein. The raw materials  and
the finances that had featured in  the  development  of  biological  weapons
used by Iraq in her war against Iran had been provided by  the  US  and  the
UK.

Bush and Blair have long sounded the battle cry  and  continue  to  bay  for
Iraqi blood. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms F HAJAIG: Deputy  Chairperson,  Deputy  President,  Ministers,  comrades,
friends and colleagues, world peace stands at a crossroads today.  Will  the
arrogant and intransigent  stance  of  the  United  States  and  the  United
Kingdom prevail or will the voices calling for peace and justice  be  heard?
Will Iraq,  once  regarded  as  the  cradle  of  civilisation,  survive  the
onslaught on its territorial integrity? Will the Iraqi people -  women,  men
and children  -  survive  another  attack  of  bombs,  CS  gas,  hunger  and
suffering?

The death of 5 000  children  a  year  from  leukaemia,  brain  tumours  and
Hodgkin's disease is possibly related to the use of  depleted  uranium  from
munitions used by the US in 1991  against  Iraq.  What  further  havoc  will
United States' and the United Kingdom's forces wreak  on  the  Iraqi  people
with its state-of-the-art weaponry?

Millions of people from all corners of the world have protested against  the
war on Iraq. Countries like Germany, Russia, China, France and  many  others
are all saying that there  is  a  real  alternative  to  war,  which  is  to
strengthen and continue inspection and the peaceful disarming  of  Iraq.  As
China said, there is no reason to close the door to peace. And that is  what
we are asking for today.

Our people, especially the women of this country, and I would  like  to  say
this on behalf of the women from my party - I am sure  the  women  from  the
other parties will also agree - that as a woman and as women of this  nation
and as women from other nations, we do not want  war.  [Applause.]  We  want
peace because it means development. We want peace. [Interjections.] No,  you
people are just like Bush and Saddam. You are all warmongers.

The United Nations Monitoring, Inspection and Verification  Commission's  Mr
Blix reported to the UN on the 7 March and he said:


  At  this  juncture,  we  are  able  to  perform  professional   no-notice
  inspections all over Iraq and to increase aerial surveillance.

He continued to say:


  The destruction of weapons undertaken constitutes a  substantial  measure
  of disarmament.

That's Blix's words, not mine.

He goes on to say:


  We are not watching a breaking of toothpicks. Lethal  weapons  are  being
  destroyed. Until today ...


7 March, that is -


  ... 34 Al-Samud II missiles  including  4  training  missiles,  2  combat
  warheads, one launcher and 5 engines have been  destroyed  under  UNMOVIC
  supervision.

The UN Resolution 1441 is being complied with. Iraq  is  disarming  and  the
United Nation's inspection team must ensure that the disarmament process  is
thorough and complete. Just as we have declared  Africa  a  nuclear  weapon-
free zone, so would we want to see the establishment, in  the  Middle  East,
of a zone  free  of  all  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  Security  Council
Resolution 487 of 1981 and Resolution 687 of 1991  affirm  the  need  for  a
speedy establishment of a nuclear weapon-free zone in that region. The  only
country  in  the  region  that  has  not  joined  the  Treaty  on  the  Non-
proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is Israel.

Israel continues to develop  and  stockpile  nuclear  arsenals.  Peter  John
Kirsh said that it has between 200 and 400 atomic  warheads.  Sharon  is  in
perfect tune with the Bush regime and enjoys its full  support.  While  Bush
is demanding the destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he  does
not ask the same of Israel. Why? An excellent example of  hypocrisy  of  the
American government! [Applause.]  How  can  there  ever  be  peace  in  that
region? [Applause.]

The United Nations is the organisation  founded  on  the  need  to  preserve
international peace and security, as  we  all  know.  The  UN  is  the  most
authoritative  voice  in  the   world   of   complex   multilateralism   and
interdependence. The UN Security Council must redouble its efforts to  bring
about  a  peaceful  resolution  to  the  situation  in  Iraq  in  line  with
international law and the provisions of the United Nation's Charter.

The legitimacy and the credibility of the UN must not be undermined by  this
issue. When the UN Security Council passes resolutions, they are binding  on
all member states. If a  member  state  is  attempting  to  abide  by  a  UN
Security  Council  resolution,  it  should  be  encouraged  to  do  so.  Any
unilateral action by the US should be deplored in the  strongest  terms.  It
is interesting that the US is prepared  to  spend  $140  billion  on  a  war
against Iraq but it is not  prepared  to  pay  its  arrears  to  the  United
Nations! [Laughter.]

 A war in Iraq will not only hurt the Iraqi  people,  but  will  destabilise
the whole region, the prime source of oil energy, which will in turn  affect
the world economy. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, war is not inevitable. All the members  of  the
UN Security Council are still saying this despite  their  differences.  This
is good news for now. Iraq has a critical role to play to  ensure  that  the
status quo remains.

As far as disarmament is concerned, according to Resolution  1441  that  was
passed  unanimously  by  the  UN  Security  Council,  Iraq  has  disarmament
obligations. It is erroneous for some to argue that Iraq is not  posing  any
danger.  Why  was  the  resolution  passed  without  opposition?  The   said
resolution goes on to say that  if  Iraq  does  not  disarm,  it  will  face
serious consequences.

The threatened military action against Iraq, if it is  carried  out  without
the backing of the UN Security Council, would be a breach of the UN  Charter
and international law. The implicit reference in the resolution  to  serious
consequences does not trigger an automatic use  of  military  force,  in  my
view. Therefore, a  second  resolution  authorising  the  use  of  force  is
necessary. The UN Security Council, for example,  will  have  to  state  the
terms and objectives of such military action.

Is Iraq disarming? The credible threat of  use  of  force  against  Iraq  is
working. Dr Blix's report bears this view out where he refers to the  latest
Iraqi  moves  to  co-operate  more.  If  one  reads  the  development   more
carefully, Iraq's co-operation with inspectors is closely  linked  with  the
developments in the UN Security Council. Dr Blix said in this regard, and  I
quote:


  One can hardly avoid the impression  that  after  a  period  of  somewhat
  reluctant co-operation, there has been  an  acceleration  of  initiatives
  from the Iraqi side since the end of January.
But Dr Blix went on to mention that, inside Iraq,  it  is  difficult  to  do
interviews with scientists without undue influence. He also says  that  Iraq
tried to mislead them on the  range  of  Al-Samud  II  missiles.  Therefore,
their  destruction  cannot  be  seen  as  a  voluntary  exercise.  Had   the
inspectors accepted Iraq's word,  these  arms  would  still  be  intact,  in
breach of disarmament obligations.

On the issue of the SA inspectors, Dr Blix in his report said that  Iraq  is
more than capable of accounting for its weapon, as it has  done  so  in  the
past  in  admirable  detail.  Therefore,  it  puzzles  me  what  value   our
unsolicited help to provide inspectors will add in this process.

As far as the 9/11 attack on the US is concerned,  it  has  been  argued  by
some that since the 9/11 attack on the US, the  rules  of  use  of  military
action have changed. I differ with this view. Despite that horrible  attack,
there is still a need for evidence to exist in  order  to  determine  as  to
whether there are terrorists links with the state  under  consideration.  No
incontrovertible evidence has been produced and accepted by the UN  Security
Council that Iraq has such links. In any case, Resolution  1441  has  to  do
with disarmament, not terrorism or regime change.

With regard to multilateralism, despite the vitriolic attack on the  US  and
UK for their  intended  unilateral  action  on  Iraq  and  President  Bush's
bellicose rhetoric for regime change, it  must  be  stated  that  these  two
countries have, up to now, shown admirable restraint and respect for the  UN
process. This is why war has not yet started. Therefore, it  is  unfair,  so
far, to accuse these countries of ignoring the UN process when we read  that
they are phoning everyone  to  this  hour  to  drum  up  support  for  their
approach.

I have serious doubts if oil is the issue - if it is only the US and UK  who
are interested in Iraqi oil,  and  that  other  countries  like  France  and
Russia are just indulging in a holy opposition to war.

In conclusion, war should be averted if at all possible.  If  Iraq  disarms,
not step by step but immediately, it looks  like  the  war  drums  may  fade
away. Thank you very much. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Agb mnr  die  Adjunkvoorsitter,  niemand  kan  tog  ooit  van
oorlog hou omdat dit vir hom lekker is nie. Oorlog is iets  vreesliks.  Juis
daarom behoort almal in beginsel ten gunste  van  die  vreedsame  beslegting
van geskille, ook dié tans in Irak, te wees.  En  tog  is  oorloë  iets  wat
bestaan vir solank die mensdom bestaan.

Alle lidlande van die VN, ook die VSA, het deur middel  van  artikel  2  van
die VN Handves afstand gedoen van oorlog as 'n middel om hulle  geskille  te
besleg. Daar word egter wel deur artikel 42, saamgelees met artikels  53  en
51, daarvoor voorsiening gemaak dat 'n  staat  homself  teen  aggressie  kan
verdedig.  Ook  kan  state  deur  middel  van  'n  VN  resolusie   van   die
Veiligheidsraad gemagtig word om geweld te gebruik  teen  'n  moondheid  wat
internasionale vrede bedreig.
Wat is egter vandag die feite op die tafel? Die VSA beskou Irak as  'n  land
wat internasionale vrede bedreig, juis vanweë Irak se  geskiedenis.  Hy  het
Koeweit aangeval, reeds chemiese wapens teen sy eie bevolking  gebruik,  die
Koerde, en daar is aanduidings dat Irak wel verbintenisse met Al Qaeda  het.
Verder is die VSA die land wat sonder aanleiding op 11 September 2001 in  sy
hartland, New York en Washington, aangeval is.

Dit is goed en reg dat ons hierdie saak vandag bespreek. Wat egter  duidelik
is, is dat indien  die  VSA  nie  deur  middel  van  'n  VN  Veiligheidsraad
resolusie gemagtig gaan word om geweld teen Irak te  gebruik  nie,  die  VSA
daarsonder, as wêreldmoondheid, in elk geval sal  voortgaan  met  'n  oorlog
teen Irak om so sy eie belange te beskerm en te bevorder, of  ons  in  Suid-
Afrika daarvan hou of nie.

Die vraag is: waar laat dit ons hier in Suid-Afrika?

Die internasionale politiek is vol dubbele standaarde. Die enigste  reël  in
die internasionale politiek is dat lande hulle eie belange  beskerm.  Daarom
is die VF se standpunt in alle internasionale sake, maar  ook  spesifiek  in
die Irak-krisis, dat Suid-Afrika moet kies wat in die beste belang van Suid-
Afrika is. Daarom sal ons 'n fout maak as ons kant kies vir Saddam  Hoesein.
Dit beteken nie dat Suid-Afrika vir die VSA moet kant kies nie.  Suid-Afrika
behoort Suid-Afrika se beste belange eerste  te  stel.  Daardie  belange  is
tans dat ons nie betrokke moet raak by  'n  oorlog  duisende  kilometer  van
Suid-Afrika af nie.

Tegnies het die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering nie kant gekies nie, maar  prakties
is alle aanduidings daar dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Regering  tog  kant  gekies
het in hierdie konflik. Hulle het vir Irak en diktator Saddam  Hoesein  kant
gekies.

As  die  verskillende  mediaverklarings  en  die  mediaonderhoude  van   die
Regering oor die Irak-krisis fyn ontleed word, sien  ons  simpatie  en  geen
werklike veroordelings van Saddam nie, slegs heftige  kritiek  op  die  VSA.
Die agb lid Winnie Mandela wil selfs persoonlik afsit na Irak om  Saddam  te
gaan beskerm teen die VSA. Sulke optrede en  verklarings  is  nie  in  Suid-
Afrika se belang nie.

Wat egter vir my 'n raaisel bly, is dat ons vandag tyd afstaan vir 'n  debat
oor die vreedsame beslegting van die situasie in Irak,  maar  geen  tyd  kan
vind vir 'n debat  oor  die  vreedsame  beslegtiging  van  die  situasie  in
Zimbabwe, wat Suid-Afrika baie meer direk en regstreeks raak  nie.  Dit  bly
vir my baie vreemd. Baie dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Hon Mr Deputy  Chairperson,  surely  no  one  can  like  war
because he enjoys it. War is something terrible. Precisely for  this  reason
everyone should, in principle, be in favour of the  peaceful  resolution  of
disputes, including the current one in Iraq. And yet wars have  existed  for
as long as mankind has existed.

All member states of the UN, including the USA, renounced war as  a  way  of
settling their differences by way of section 2 of the UN  Charter.  However,
provision is made by way of section 42, read together with sections  53  and
51, that a state can defend itself against aggression. States can  also,  by
way of a UN resolution from the  Security  Council,  be  authorised  to  use
force against a state which is jeopardising international peace.

However, what are the facts on the table today? The  USA  views  Iraq  as  a
country  jeopardising  international  peace,  precisely  because  of  Iraq's
history. It attacked Kuwait, has already used chemical weapons  against  its
own population, namely the Kurds, and there are indications  that  Iraq  has
ties with Al Qaeda. Furthermore, the USA is the country which  was  attacked
in its heartland,  New  York  and  Washington,  without  provocation  on  11
September 2001.

It is good and right that we are  discussing  this  matter  today.  However,
what is clear is that if the USA is not going to be authorised to use  force
against Iraq by way of a UN Security Council resolution, as  a  world  power
the USA will proceed with a war against Iraq  without  it  in  any  case  to
protect and promote its own interests, whether we in South  Africa  like  it
or not.

The question is: Where does that leave us here in South Africa?

International politics is  full  of  double  standards.  The  only  rule  in
international politics is that countries protect their  own  interests.  For
that reason the  FF's  position  in  all  international  matters,  but  also
specifically in the Iraq crisis, is that South Africa must  choose  what  is
in the best interests of South  Africa.  Therefore  we  would  be  making  a
mistake if we chose Saddam Hussain's side. This does  not  mean  that  South
Africa should choose the USA's side. South Africa should put South  Africa's
best interests first. Those interests  are  currently  that  we  should  not
become involved in a war thousands of kilometres from South Africa.

Technically the South African  Government  has  not  chosen  sides,  but  in
practice all indications are that the South African  Government  has  indeed
chosen sides in this conflict.  They  have  chosen  the  side  of  Iraq  and
dictator Saddam Hussain.

If the various media reports and the media interviews  from  the  Government
on the Iraq crisis are  closely  analysed,  we  see  sympathy  and  no  real
condemnation of Saddam, only strong criticism of the  USA.  The  hon  member
Winnie Mandela even wants to take off for Iraq personally to go and  protect
Saddam against the USA.  Such  actions  and  statements  are  not  in  South
Africa's interests.

However, what remains a mystery to me, is that today we are taking time  for
a debate on the peaceful resolution of the situation  in  Iraq,  but  cannot
find time for a debate on  the  peaceful  resolution  of  the  situation  in
Zimbabwe, which affects South Africa  far  more  directly  and  immediately.
This remains very strange to me. Thank you.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Deputy Chairperson, as we count  the  days,  hours  and
minutes to the impending attack on Iraq by  the  United  States,  there  are
many who believe that war can still be averted. Rightfully so, the  majority
of countries do not believe that war is  the  only  solution  to  make  Iraq
comply with the United  Nations  resolution.  This  realisation  is  brought
about by the consequences that the war will  have  on  Iraqi  civilians  and
global stability.

As South Africans, we have an obligation to stand up and  be  counted  among
nations committed to bringing about peace and long-lasting solutions to  the
current impasse in Iraq. We, therefore, view the South African  Governments'
role in this regard as a positive step in the right  direction.  The  United
Nations' acceptance of South Africa's initiative to add value to  the  whole
process in realising the set objectives of the United  Nations,  as  far  as
Iraq is concerned, forms the basis on which we need to view Deputy  Minister
Pahad's role.

It is not fair, at this point, to conclude whether the trip  to  Baghdad  by
the South African team was worth it or not.  The  Deputy  Minister  and  his
team's efforts should be appreciated and welcomed. [Applause.]

We are confident that the Deputy Minister's  team's  efforts  to  help  Iraq
honour the obligations imposed by  the  United  Nations  Security  Council's
Resolution 1441, to bring us back from the brink of  war,  will  bear  fruit
only if indeed the Iraqi government  is  sincere  that  they  have  complied
beyond any reasonable doubt. It has to be pointed out that at this point  in
time we have no reason to speculate whether they have complied or not.  What
is crucial at this point is to wait for the  United  Nations  inspectors  to
table their report as to the real  status  of  Iraq's  disarmament  in  this
regard.

We fully  support  and  believe  in  the  integrity  of  the  South  African
scientists who accompanied  hon  Pahad  on  his  mission.  Their  wealth  of
experience and knowledge, as  independent  scientists  of  note,  cannot  be
questioned, as this will really help  to  corroborate  the  United  Nations'
report. Their role and mandate to Iraq was clear: to help ensure  that  Iraq
is truly free of weapons of mass destruction, as it claims that it does  not
possess any. At this stage, the report prepared by the  South  African  team
pertaining to their brief ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Dr S E M  PHEKO:  Deputy  Chairman,  all  countries  with  weapons  of  mass
destruction  must  disarm.  We  further  call  upon   the   United   Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection  Commission  and  the  International
Atomic Energy Agency to inspect the United  States  and  Britain  to  verify
disarmament. [Laughter.] [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The American government wants to use the United Nations for legitimacy,  yet
usurps its power by allowing President George W. Bush  to  use  the  new  US
doctrine of pre-emption, which declares  that  the  United  States  has  the
right to invade sovereign countries and overthrow their governments if  they
are seen as hostile to US interests.

The PAC questions whether such a country should continue to be a  member  of
the United Nations, when it works contrary to the rules of this world  body.
The PAC knows that the US is demanding that countries in the  global  South,
such as North Korea and Iraq, disarm, yet it has no intention of  disarming.
It is clear that the United States wants to  have  unilateral  power  and  a
military monopoly to attack  at  will  any  country  with  wealth  which  it
covets, in this case the oil interests in Iraq.

It is shocking that  the  US  has  just  tested  its  most  powerful,  life-
destroying  bomb,  while  it  demands  the  disarming  of   other   nations.
[Applause.] We will continue to support a veto by the permanent  members  of
the United Nations Security Council, enabling them to block  action  against
Iraq.

A war against Iraq will have a devastating effect on the  economies  of  the
world, especially those of the developing countries. We reject  the  foolish
view that weapons of mass destruction are in safe hands  when  possessed  by
the nations of the North, but are unsafe in the hands of  the  countries  of
the South.

World peace today is threatened  by  some  countries  of  the  North,  which
possess weapons of mass destruction and want to enjoy  a  military  monopoly
and domination over unarmed nations.

History is about to repeat itself. World  war  broke  out,  with  disastrous
consequences for mankind, when the League of  Nations,  the  predecessor  of
the United Nations, was  defied  by  its  members.  The  League  of  Nations
collapsed, to the detriment of peace, and World War II  broke  out,  killing
millions of people.

If the USA attacks  Iraq  without  the  authorisation  of  the  UN  Security
Council, the UN will go the tragic way  of  the  League  of  Nations.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, the MF  supports  the  former  US  President,
Jimmy Carter, in his sentiments that alternative  methods  to  attain  peace
have not been explored by the Bush pro-war  team;  that  solid  evidence  to
justify going to war has not been given; and that  if  war  is  imposed,  it
violates basic  religious  principles  and  disrespects  international  law.
Besides that, the former president also noted that it  may  destabilise  the
Middle East and increase possible terrorist attacks on the US.

So what is the US up to? Media reports of Bush's  statements  have  shown  a
pro-war campaign that is justified purely by the intensity of the  calls  to
go to war. Most importantly, the defiance of the UN is unacceptable. The  MF
feels that Bush should take the advice of Carter and rather support  the  UN
by standing as a military threat if Iraq  does  not  comply  with  the  UN's
resolution, and not go to war.

Reports have been made that Iraq continues, wilfully, to destroy weapons  of
mass  destruction  under  UN  supervision.  According   to   Chief   Weapons
Inspector, Dr Hans Blix, and Dr El Baradei, Iraq has been co-operating  with
disarmament demands.  Accordingly,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Iraq  has
resumed its nuclear  programme.  Inspectors  have  found  no  indication  of
nuclear-related prohibited activities at any inspected sites.
According to Dr Hans Blix, even if Iraq is willing, it would take months  to
disarm. Peaceful disarmament is possible and there are many alternatives  to
war, in this instance. Noting that, the MF feels that the  pro-war  campaign
by Bush poses  a  greater  threat  to  world  peace  than  weapons  of  mass
destruction. Bush claims that there will be minimal loss of  civilian  lives
but we don't want any loss of lives nor does the rest of the  world,  as  so
many take to the streets in antiwar protests. In this instance,  it  appears
as though hearing and sensibility have been lost  and  determination  for  a
blood bath is craved. The US claims that this wilful disarmament by Iraq  is
just a charade  and  that  whilst  destroying  weapons,  Iraq  continues  to
produce them. Where is the evidence for such claims?

The MF hopes that the report given to the Secretary-General of the UN,  Kofi
Annan, and our President, the hon Thabo Mbeki, by our team of South  African
disarmament experts who visited Baghdad will be made public  so  that  South
Africans may be made aware of the situation in Iraq, allowing us to  take  a
stance on this issue. The MF supports antiwar  initiatives  and  feels  that
alternative methods should be explored to ensure  that  Iraq  complies  with
the UN resolution to abolish weapons of mass destruction.

The MF supports the ministerial view. The MF says: No to war and no  to  the
loss of lives. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Deputy Chair, the United Nations  appointed  inspectors
in  order  to  satisfy  itself  whether  Iraq  possesses  weapons  of   mass
destruction or not. This, indeed, was a wise move so that we  can  all  come
to know whether they possess them, and if they do possess them,  then  those
weapons of mass destruction should be destroyed peacefully.

Even before the process is over, the United States says: No,  we  are  going
to attack Iraq, whilst they were  actually  party  to  the  resolution  that
said: We must go and search and satisfy ourselves whether indeed  there  are
weapons of mass destruction. This is, indeed, a  very  serious  matter.  Any
serious observer of the current situation in Iraq will have been  struck  by
the US's attitude to these developments.

Equally, one cannot fail to be struck by the visionary exhaustion of the  US
and United Kingdom. One key sign of  this  poverty  of  vision  is  the  two
countries' insistence on the use of force to disarm Iraq when  the  majority
of the countries in the whole world are prepared  to  use  the  UN  team  of
inspectors to disarm Iraq. We can only conclude  that  the  US  and  Britain
have agendas other than to search for weapons of mass destruction.

How  can  we  explain  the  fact  that  the  UN  Resolution  1441  seeks  to
investigate the presence of weapons of  mass  destruction  through  peaceful
means and yet the US and Britain insist on war?  How  can  one  explain  the
fact that the US has already deployed thousands  of  troops  in  preparation
for war  when  the  inspectors  have  reported  that  Iraq  is  co-operating
beautifully?

As far as Azapo knows, the question  of  removing  Saddam  Hussein  and  the
government of Iraq from power is not part of Resolution 1441. The fact  that
the US and Britain want to replace the government of  Iraq  with  their  own
tells us more about their attitudes. The fact that the  same  US  government
believes that the resolution of the North Korean crisis should be done on  a
multilateral basis and yet rejects the  same  process  which  is  under  the
United Nations'  auspices  tells  us  a  lot  about  them.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Deputy Chairperson, I wish to reiterate  the  ANC's  position
of opposition to all weapons  of  mass  destruction  irrespective  of  which
state possesses them. I wish also to use this  podium  to  call  upon  those
states that have developed such weapons to follow South Africa's example  by
totally dismantling them.

Today the governments of the United States and Britain plan  placing  a  new
resolution before the United  Nations  Security  Council  which  gives  Iraq
until 17 March to comply fully with the previous  resolution  or  face  war.
South Africa, and I assume all parties in this august House, fully  supports
the existing United Nations  Security  Council's  resolutions  which  demand
that Iraq destroy all weapons of mass destruction that it has developed  and
that the Iraqi government proactively assist the UN  weapons  inspectors  in
verifying their destruction.

In his most recent report  to  the  UN  Security  Council,  the  UN's  Chief
Weapons Inspector, Dr Hans Blix,  has  indicated  that  Iraqi  co-operation,
even if reluctant, is now forthcoming. The indecent haste with which the  US
and British governments wish to rush into war is cause for profound  concern
throughout the world. Millions of ordinary citizens, including thousands  of
Americans, have taken to the streets to give  expression  to  that  concern.
Former President, Jimmy Carter, has added his  voice  to  those  counselling
the observance of international law and greater patience on the part of  the
Bush administration. Prime Minister Blair is faced with the  prospect  of  a
revolt within his own cabinet because of his haste.
Our concern is fuelled  also  by  the  more  bizarre  happenings  that  have
accompanied this frenzied  rush  into  war.  Hon  members  will  recall  the
laughable attempt by the British Foreign Minister, Jack Straw, to  pass  off
a PhD thesis by an  American  student  as  solid  intelligence  gathered  by
Britain's secret services. Such acts of bad faith suggest a hidden agenda.

The belligerent statements of US  Secretary  of  Defence,  Donald  Rumsfeld,
threatening to go to war even without  British  participation  heighten  our
anxieties. I truly wish that our fears were far less  well-founded,  but  we
continue to read disturbing media reports of how the spoils of this  planned
war are already being divided amongst the prospective victors. The  Guardian
from Britain,  for  example,  reports  that  a  select  group  of  companies
includes Kellog  Brown  and  Root,  a  subsidiary  of  Halliburton,  an  oil
services company where the Vice President Dick Cheney held the  position  of
chief executive from 1995 to 2000. Kellog Brown and Root has already  won  a
government contract to oversee firefighting operations  at  Iraqi  oilfields
after any US-led invasion while other companies also having strong  ties  to
the US administration including the construction company Bechtel, the  Fluor
Corporation  and  Louis  Berger  group,  already   are   involved   in   the
reconstruction of Afghanistan.

The report continues and says that to speed  up  the  projects,  the  United
States Agency for International Development  invoked  special  authority  to
solicit bids from just a few companies. The move bypassed  the  usual  rules
that would have permitted a wider array of companies to  seek  the  contract
which was first reported by Time magazine and the Wall Street Journal.

Even more bothersome are reports that the United States intends  using  Iraq
as some sort of laboratory to test new  weapons  systems.  A  report  by  an
American journalist, Jim Krane, reads:


  If the United States unleashes a military attack against Iraq, US  forces
  are expected to unsheath  several  new  weapons  and  tactics,  including
  devices still under development.
He quotes a Bush administration official as saying: The only  time  you  get
realistic feedback on new capabilities is during wartime. The military  will
take advantage of that time to test new weapons.

All these things seem to suggest that there is some agenda  other  than  the
disarming of Iraq behind the actions of  the  Bush  administration  and  the
Blair government. [Applause.] I submit that it cannot be in  South  Africa's
national interest to  allow  the  multilateral  institutions,  so  painfully
built up since 1945  for  our  collective  security,  to  be  subverted  and
destroyed because of the impatience of one country and its ally.  It  cannot
be in South Africa's national interest to allow the  world  to  be  reshaped
and recast by the military power of one superpower and its ally.

Yes, indeed, Boy Geldenhuys, we are being asked to choose. But it is  not  a
choice between Saddam Hussein and the United States of America.  The  choice
that we are being required to make is to  choose  between  an  international
order based on the rule of international law or  one  based  on  the  dictum
that might is right. [Applause.] I think that the  members  of  this  august
House know which of those the people of  South  Africa  prefer.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                              NOTICE OF MOTION

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Chairperson,  I  hereby  give
notice that I shall move on the next sitting day of this House that:


  That the House calls on -


  (1) all nations  to  dismantle  weapons  of  mass  destruction  in  their
       possession and to pursue the objective of a world free of weapons  of
       mass destruction;


  (2)  all  members  of  the  Security  Council  of  the   United   Nations
       Organisation to oppose unilateral military action against Iraq; and


  (3) members of the Security Council  to  respect  internationally  agreed
       multilateral processes and institutions aimed at  maintaining  global
       peace which is a necessary condition for socio-economic development.

                     CELEBRATION OF KING MOSHOESHOE DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY  PARTY:  Deputy  Chairperson,  I  move
without notice that the House -


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the people of Lesotho celebrated King Moshoeshoe Day on 11
       March 2003;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  this was the celebration of a hero of our  struggle  who  fought
           tirelessly  against  colonialism,  land  dispossession,   racial
           oppression and economic subjugation of the African people; and


       (b)   his  resistance  against  colonialism  continues   to   inspire
           generations of African people as they work towards  the  revival
           of the African continent and the building of  a  peaceful,  just
           and fairer world; and


  (2) commemorates the heroic battles waged by the Basotho people under the
       leadership of King Moshoeshoe:


         Setjhaba se tswele pele ho tlisa ntjhafatso ya Afrika yohle!


         [The nation continues  to  advance  the  rebirth  of  Africa  as  a
         whole!]


         Kgotso, pula, nala, bana ba Morena Moshoeshoe!


         [Let there  be  peace  and  prosperity  for  all  the  children  of
         Moshoeshoe!]


         Moshwashwaila wa ha kadi Lebeola!.

Agreed to.

            THE ROLE OF CHILD PROTECTION UNITS IN THE PROTECTION
                       OF THE CHILDREN OF SOUTH AFRICA

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr M WATERS: Deputy Chair, first and foremost I would like  to  thank  Madam
Speaker for allowing this debate to take place, because it brings  out  into
the open one of South Africa's worst and darkest secrets: the abuse  of  our
children. And while we applaud ourselves that we brought the  World  Cup  to
our country, thousands of overseas fans now know  our  deepest  and  darkest
secret. Knowing that people from outside are now aware of what we do to  our
children makes me hang my head in shame, as we all  should  particularly  in
this House, where we are in a position to make a difference but have not.

When  Madam  Speaker  spoke  to  the  Committee  on   Public   Service   and
Administration she asked one very pertinent question. It was: Is the  Public
Service organised and skilled enough to deliver services?  The  answer  from
many  departments  was  a  resounding  no,  and  particularly   from   child
protection units.

Recently, I personally visited all 45 child protection units throughout  our
country in order to see for myself what the situation  was  on  the  ground;
what it was really like. As Helen Suzman advised us, if  you  want  to  know
what is happening on the ground, you should go to see for yourselves.  So  I
did.

The findings are in this report which the Minister of  Safety  and  Security
received - hand delivered - on the day that it was released. I  was  shocked
by the sheer numbers of child and baby rape: the figure for  2001  has  just
been released: it is 44 466. I repeat: 44 000  children  and  babies  raped.
That is one every 12 minutes. By the time I finish  my  speech  here  today,
another child will have been raped. Also shocked  by  the  unacceptably  low
conviction rate, I decided to find out the real reasons behind it all.

The officers of the CPU are  a  child's  first  line  of  defence.  However,
instead  of  finding  units  fully  resourced,  trained  and   equipped,   I
discovered units overworked, stressed and hopelessly underresourced.

The Government has declared child abuse  a  top-priority  crime.  The  facts
speak for themselves and indicate that what is said here in  Parliament  has
very little effect on the ground.

According to the Minister, there should  be  1 432  officers  at  CPUs.  The
actual figure of 739 means we  are  short  693  officers,  or  a  staggering
48,4%.  The  Western  Cape  is  the  most  severely   affected   being   78%
underresourced, followed by Mpumalanga which is 71% underresourced.

Do these figures reflect the  Government's  commitment  to  combating  child
abuse and rape? No, they do not.

Understaffing results in higher workloads for CPU  officers.  Their  ability
to help child victims depends largely on the  sheer  volume  of  cases  they
have at any one time.  An  officer  has  many  duties  to  perform:  helping
victims  and  taking  them  for  medical  examinations,  investigating   and
gathering evidence, transporting victims to and from court,  and  testifying
in court. What is clear is that  there  is  a  limit  to  the  caseload  one
individual can possibly cope with, no matter how talented or dedicated  that
individual may be.

According to a reply to  a  parliamentary  question,  the  ideal  number  of
dockets a detective in the Police Service should  be  carrying  at  any  one
time is 18, and that is this  pile  here.  This  reflects  18  dockets.  The
national average, though, is a shocking 62 dockets, and this is the  average
caseload that every child protection officer  is  carrying  at  the  moment.
Sixty-two dockets! [Interjections.] Nobody can investigate  this  number  of
dockets thoroughly.

Gauteng's average caseload is 55 per  investigating  officer;  the  Northern
Cape is 58; KwaZulu-Natal is 64; the Western Cape is 77; and  Mpumalanga  is
104.

I ask you how any human being can investigate cases properly when he or  she
has 60, 80 or 100 cases to investigate. It is  no  wonder  so  many  of  the
accused get away with rape and abuse. We all agree that these workloads  are
excessive, but what are we as members of Parliament  doing  about  this?  We
demand higher conviction rates, but fail to  empower  the  very  units  that
could deliver what we all want.

Fifty-three per cent of officers  at  these  specialised  units  have  never
received training in child protection. I repeat:  53%  of  all  officers  at
CPUs have never received training in child protection. One would think  that
all CPU officers would be trained  in  child  protection  before  joining  a
unit. This is not so.

At the Phuthaditjhaba  CPU  not  one  officer  has  been  trained  in  child
protection. The same in Durban South. In Pietermaritzburg  84%  of  officers
have had no training in child protection; and the figure for East London  is
79%.

So let us recap. We have underresourced the CPUs by 48%,  we  give  officers
three and half times their  workload,  and  we  fail  to  arm  investigating
officers with basic training.  Yet  we  are  all  up  in  arms  because  the
conviction rate for child rape is a miserable 8%. It is an absolute  outrage
that the ANC Government can claim to be committed to doing all it can.

To add insult to injury, the physical  environment  in  which  officers  are
expected to work and the lack of basic  equipment,  such  as  vehicles,  are
also hampering investigations. Many police officers  are  expected  to  cram
themselves into tiny  offices.  In  Mmabatho  three  investigators  use  the
kitchen as their office. Buildings are run-down. For example, the Temba  CPU
is in a dilapidated building; while at the Port Shepstone CPU  the  roof  is
collapsing.
Security is also a major problem. At the Richards  Bay  CPU  they  have  had
four  break-ins  in  two  years.  The  Pietermaritzburg  unit  has  had  two
burglaries in two years. Middelburg, Louis Trichardt, Rustenburg and De  Aar
have all been burgled in the past two years. At Port Elizabeth there was  an
attempted rape of a police officer while she was in the lift  going  to  her
office.

Aside from the facilities and resources needed to help  children,  each  CPU
must have resources to conduct investigations.  Telephones  are  not  always
available, and investigators use their  own  cellphones  knowing  that  they
will not be paid for their expenses. The high mileage and poor condition  of
vehicles mean that their reliability comes into question.

In order for investigating officers to do their work, they  need  to  either
pick up the phone or jump into a vehicle.  If  they  cannot  do  that,  they
cannot conduct basic investigatory work.

At the Benoni CPU all the vehicles have car radios,  but  they  are  so  old
that the radio cannot pick up the channel  that  the  police  are  currently
using, rendering them useless. Last year two officers of the  Germiston  CPU
went to  retrieve  an  abducted  child.  Both  officers  were  wounded,  one
critically. Neither of the officers had hand-held  radios  on  them,  so  no
backup could be called for. The second officer had to leopard  crawl,  while
injured, to his partner and use her  cellphone  to  call  for  help.  You're
probably thinking: Why didn't he crawl to the  car?  Well,  the  car  didn't
have a radio in it either.

The work these police officers do is, by its very nature, highly  disturbing
and traumatic. This is made even more difficult  by  the  resource  shortage
and  working  conditions  described,  yet  counselling  or  debriefing   for
officers hardly ever happens. According to the Police  Service,  counselling
sessions should take place at least once every two years.

KwaZulu-Natal presents the worst  picture.  In  the  eight  years  that  the
Pietermaritzburg unit has been operational, no one has ever been  debriefed.
In Ladysmith it has never happened, even when a member  of  the  unit's  own
child was raped. They never sent anyone in to give debriefing.

At Port Shepstone there was a debriefing session, but only after an  officer
tried to shoot himself. The Goodwood unit in the Western Cape  has  lost  29
members in the last six years owing to stress, and  not  even  the  officers
who worked on baby Tshepang's case were given  psychological  support,  even
when they requested it.

Many units are not being paid overtime. When I visited the  Pietermaritzburg
unit the members were on a go-slow and had been  for  four  months,  working
only until 4pm during the week. That means there  was  no  one  on  duty  at
night or over weekends when most children are raped and abused.

The area management told them that  there  was  no  money  for  overtime.  I
immediately wrote to the Minister and the National  Commissioner.  Within  a
week the problem was resolved, and the police officers  received  all  their
back pay. But why does it take an opposition MP to become involved  for  any
action to be taken? It is also a pity that  the  overtime  disputes  at  the
Durban North and Durban South units still have not been resolved.

In addition to not being properly staffed or equipped to combat the  scourge
of violence against children,  these  officers  do  not  receive  much  help
either from government departments that are supposed to assist.

At state hospitals the shortage of doctors forces raped children to wait  in
queues for three to five hours before being examined. Some doctors are  even
refusing to examine raped children, citing that they are not trained  to  do
so. The DA has documentary proof of this from the East  London,  Vereeniging
and Port Elizabeth units.

Delays in obtaining DNA results mean that many cases are withdrawn from  the
court roll. Instead of taking 84 days for DNA to be analysed,  it  can  take
up to a year, but in  most  cases  four  to  six  months.  Once  a  case  is
withdrawn the suspect is released  from  prison,  ready  to  intimidate  the
victim.

According to the Minister of Social Development, there are  1 400  vacancies
for social workers. This results in assessment reports  for  victims  taking
over one year to  complete.  Excessive  delays  mean  that  many  cases  are
withdrawn from the court roll.

Many courts still lack basic equipment that would  allow  a  child  to  give
evidence in a separate  room  via  a  TV  monitor.  Owing  to  the  lack  of
intermediaries, the equipment is not used and a  child  is  forced  to  give
evidence in court and  in  front  of  the  accused.  Some  cases  have  been
withdrawn, as in Vereeniging, owing to the nonappearance  of  intermediaries
where three rapists were set free with a warning by  the  magistrate.  Where
there is equipment, such as in Germiston, it has been broken  for  over  two
months.

When cases go to the High Court, the investigating  officer  has  to  ensure
that the victim and the accused are present. The lack of staff and  vehicles
poses a problem. At the De Aar unit in the Northern  Cape,  when  travelling
to the Kimberley High Court, the victim sits in the front of the  car  while
the accused sits in the back. Can you imagine the fear that the  child  must
go through?

This is but a snapshot of the life of an officer working at a  CPU.  And  it
is no wonder we only have a conviction rate of 8%.

The DA would like to make some recommendations: that vacant posts of  police
officers at all CPUs, of social workers and of  those  working  at  forensic
laboratories be declared scarce skills so  that  all  vacant  posts  can  be
filled;  that  all  CPU  officers  receive  immediate  training   in   child
protection and basic detective work;  that  all  doctors  working  at  state
hospitals immediately receive training in how to use the new crime kits  and
how to complete the J88 form; that the Department  of  Health  undertake  to
train doctors in how to conduct forensic examinations of children; that  the
training of magistrates and prosecutors who deal with  children  be  speeded
up; that a group of intermediaries be assigned to a cluster of courts  on  a
full-time availability basis; that a judicial inspectorate be  appointed  in
order to ascertain the immediate needs  analysis  of  all  CPUs;  and,  that
unfinished cases from 2001 and before be prioritised and concluded with  the
possible establishment of Saturday courts.

If all these recommendations were implemented, maybe we  as  South  Africans
could hold our heads up high at the next  world  conference  or  World  Cup.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson  and  hon
members, notwithstanding some of the observations that the  hon  Waters  has
made, I would really like to appeal to members of this House to remember  at
all times when we discuss issues of crime, that we  should  understand  that
all of us, given that we are peace-loving  South  Africans  and  law-abiding
citizens, belong on the same side.
The message that we should send out is that  we,  all  of  us  here,  public
representatives of our people, are fighting the criminals out there.  That's
the message we should give. [Applause.]

I want to express my appreciation to police  officials  who,  risking  their
lives, continue to provide policing in South Africa. I do  this  because  if
the criminals, who are listening to this  debate,  get  an  impression  that
South Africa's policing has totally collapsed  ...  [Interjections]  ...  It
has not. Therefore I want to appeal to those speakers who will  speak  after
me to understand that we are united as public representatives in  the  fight
against crime. [Applause.] And we will  give  the  criminals  out  there  no
quarter at all.

In the past six weeks three of our  children  lost  their  lives  violently.
These murders happened in the area  of  our  country  where  this  House  is
located. Kayleen Clayton, a 12-year old  schoolgirl,  was  murdered  in  her
home in Ottery on February 7. Two suspects were arrested and  they  appeared
yesterday at the Wynberg Magistrate's Court.
Tyrone Steenkamp, aged 6, was caught in gang warfare  crossfire  last  week,
and died outside his home where he was playing.  Miquela  Appolis,  aged  9,
also died in similar circumstances yesterday.  The  police  made  an  arrest
last night and more arrests are in the offing.

Our sympathy goes to  the  parents,  the  relatives  and  friends  of  these
murdered children. We promise that all  the  perpetrators  of  these  crimes
will be brought to book, and that more resources will be mobilised  to  deal
with gangsterism on the Cape Flats.

Apart from the resources  that  will  come  from  the  department,  we  need
community support, particularly as it relates  to  information,  for  us  to
deal exhaustively with the gangsters in every corner  of  our  country.  The
police structure that handles investigations of crimes of this nature,  like
murder and gangsterism,  is  the  Serious  and  Violent  Crimes  Unit  whose
members made the arrests I have referred to.

The matter under discussion  today  has  been,  since  the  year  2000,  the
subject of a broader  programme  of  interaction  between  the  Minister  of
Safety and Security and a  significant  number  of  role-players,  including
members  of  this  House.  The  matter  has  to  do  with   our   democratic
transformation.

You will recall that my predecessor, Comrade Steve Tshwete,  delivering  his
Budget Vote speech in this House on 7 June 2001,  explained  the  Ministry's
integrated  approach   to   policing.   This   approach   necessitated   the
reorganisation of the  various  police  structures  we  inherited  from  the
previous regime.

Structures that had to be reorganised included  the  Detective  Service.  It
became necessary for the department to adopt  a  new  stance  in  regard  to
investigations and capacity-building.

In the past investigations were fragmented, available intelligence  was  not
shared, and there was often duplication of both functions and  payments  for
information leading  to  successful  investigations  and  prosecutions.  The
reorganisation helped to  enhance  and  strengthen  the  capacity  of  SAPS'
detectives at a local level, effectively, to investigate crime.

The process of change has not been  without  bumps  and  hiccups.  There  is
unevenness  as  we  develop  the  new  structures.  This  has  not  impacted
negatively on the Police  Services'  ability  to  create  an  atmosphere  of
safety and security for all our people. Policing  has  not  collapsed  as  a
result of the reorganisation.

On the contrary, the new structures enjoy better co-ordination and  resource
allocation. As in the case of other areas of our transformation  agenda,  we
knew that there would be resistance on the part of some of  our  members  to
the changes we're introducing. The great majority of  our  members,  though,
accept the transformation of the Service, and give of  their  best  as  they
serve our country and our nation.

During  the  course  of  2000,  the   department   launched   an   extensive
communication and consultation process to get  the  buy-in  from  all  role-
players in regard to the restructuring. It was necessary to do  this,  given
that inherent in the restructuring would be the phasing-out  of  some  units
that existed before 1994.

I  will  not  list  the  various  structures  and  organisations  that  were
consulted on this matter, but allow me to say they  included  the  Portfolio
Committee  on  Safety  and  Security,  the  Standing  Committee  on   Public
Accounts, the Banking Council, the Farming Community Institute for  Security
Studies and Business Against Crime.

Subsequent to the changes, the  Minister  has  responded  to  more  than  15
parliamentary questions on the restructuring. I raise  this  because  it  is
clear to  me  some  of  us  in  this  House  may  not  have  understood  the
reorganisation that  we  mounted  to  transform  the  South  African  Police
Service.

The matter of the Child Protection Units is one of the  areas  of  our  work
that  has  not  been  understood.  The  first  Child  Protection  Unit   was
established  in  1986.  Further  interaction  subsequently  influenced  more
changes in the way we handled child protection. The  argument  was  advanced
by many of our partners at community level that we needed  to  redefine  our
approach by broadening our mandate to cover women.

The response to this saw the establishment of  the  first  Family  Violence,
Child  Protection  and  Sexual  Offences  Unit  in  1995.  This   became   a
multipurpose structure whose scope of work became broader than that  of  the
Child Protection Units. The FCS, as we refer to these units, deal  with  all
crimes against women and children.

Government's transformation programme is not  only  confined  to  personnel.
The democratic changes we  are  introducing  include  the  restructuring  of
state organs so  that  they  become  appropriate  vehicles  to  advance  our
democratic ideas.

The challenge  we  face  also  requires  new  strategies  and  tactics.  The
restructuring within the South African Police Service  is  the  response  to
the new challenges and tactical questions of the day.

Before the year 2000 we had 534 specialised units in the Detective  Service.
We have to date shut down 270 of  them.  The  personnel  from  the  affected
units were integrated into the Serious and  Violent  Crime  Units,  and  the
Organised Crime Units.

The main thrust of this exercise is to ensure  integrated  policing  through
multidisciplinary interventions under one operational management  structure.
Every element of  the  new  structures  is  influenced  by  the  operational
dictates of the crime that we combat.

The  multidisciplinary  units  deal  with  clusters  of  crime  defined   as
organised crime, serious and  violent  crime,  commercial  crime  and  crime
against women and children. We adopted a phased approach  to  bring  in  the
new structures.

The 45 units that the hon member has referred to,  which  deal  with  crimes
against women and children, comprise  32  Child  Protection  Units,  and  13
Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual  Offences  Units.  These  units
have 945 members. A new allocation during the current  financial  year  will
raise the number to 1 284. [Applause.] We eventually will deploy 1 476  such
members to deal with crimes against women and children, mobilised  under  53
units. The units will have 738 vehicles. At the moment the 945 members  have
access to 374 vehicles.

The South African law enforcement regime demands that all  members  of  SAPS
must be trained in their basic police  course  to  understand  all  relevant
legislation regarding, among others, our law on  domestic  violence,  sexual
offences and victim empowerment. All of them  have  to  undergo  that  basic
training.

Throughout the year we arrange education and training sessions, as  well  as
workshops and seminars to  keep  members  abreast  of  new  developments  in
detective and investigative methods. Between the beginning of April and  the
end of December last year, we trained 925 SAPS members to deal  with  crimes
against women  and  children.  There  are  81  members  who  are  undergoing
training at the moment.

In the next financial year, we will admit to  five  Family  Violence,  Child
Protection and Sexual Offences Units  investigators'  training  courses  for
375 members. I want to stress that all our detectives are trained to  handle
crimes against women and children, including  sexual  offences.  [Applause.]
Any detective, therefore, who is first on the scene of such  a  crime,  will
be able to handle all the challenges he or she will confront.

Given the fact that crimes against women and children happen  behind  closed
doors or in secluded places, where the victims know  the  perpetrators,  the
police  through  a  process  of  direct  engagement,  through  a  system  of
partnerships, have  built  good  relations  at  community  level  that  have
inspired confidence in their work. The police, in the  circumstances,  enjoy
a level of acceptability that they were  not  accorded  in  the  past.  This
results in more people coming forward to report  crimes  against  women  and
children ensuring, therefore, better success in the  investigation  of  such
crimes.

Last year, the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences  Units'
investigators opened 32 710 case dockets. By the end of  the  year,  19  512
cases were already before court. The courts meted out 98 life sentences  and
10 984 years imprisonment to  perpetrators  who  sexually  abused  children,
among cases that were finalised last year. The imposed life  sentences  were
a direct result of the enactment by Parliament, in  1997,  of  the  Criminal
Law Amendment Act that provided for mandatory minimum sentences  for  crimes
such as the rape of children under the age of 16.

The Department of Justice will be piloting, through Parliament,  the  Sexual
Offences Bill that among other things will make it  easier  for  victims  of
sexual offences to  testify  in  court.  The  Bill  creates  a  category  of
vulnerable witnesses, including children, who will receive  assistance  from
support persons and intermediaries. They  will  be  able  to  give  evidence
through one-way mirrors, and  there  are  already  31  courtrooms  in  South
Africa where these one-way mirrors have been installed.

To date the Department of Justice has established, country-wide,  27  sexual
offences courts.  More  of  these  will  be  created.  Support  persons  and
intermediaries already exist. They include members of the Teddy Bear  Clinic
in Soweto and Bee Courtwise in Pretoria  and  Johannesburg.  Trauma  clinics
and community safety centres have also been established to  service  victims
of crimes against women and children.

In conclusion, let me say that the SAPS  Detective  Service  will  be  fully
restructured by the end of 2005. This means that the Child Protection  Units
that we still have will be  transformed  into  the  Family  Violence,  Child
Protection and Sexual Offences Units that will take over all  investigations
regarding crime against women and children.
Our crime combating programme will be boosted by the  deployment  of  sector
police who will be in close proximity of the people where they  live;  their
response time to cries for help will be quicker, while their  mere  presence
and visibility in  the  designated  sectors  would  be  a  strong  deterrent
against crime.

We expect that crimes against women  and  children  will  be  reduced  as  a
consequence. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: On 15 October 2002, this House debated the issue  of  child
rape as a matter of public importance at the  request  of  the  Minister  of
Home Affairs and President of the IFP, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The  feature
of that debate was the  unanimous  condemnation  of  acts  of  sexual  abuse
directed at children. A further feature of that debate was widespread  calls
for the problem to be attacked at the level of the wider society.

Unfortunately, since that debate, the picture relating to  sexual  abuse  of
and violence against children has not dramatically improved. We  still  read
and hear stories of child rape and other forms of violence against  children
on a far too regular  basis.  There  should  be  no  doubt  that  an  entire
generation of South Africans experienced violence as a  way  of  life  under
apartheid. A systematically brutalised and traumatised society has been  one
of the worst legacies of our  past.  In  addition,  a  generation  of  South
Africans appear to have ingrained violent behaviour  in  various  forms  and
manifestations as  a  way  of  coming  to  terms  with  their  own  personal
circumstances and experiences. In my opinion, the crux of the  problem  that
faces us lies in the repairing the tears in our moral and social fabric.  It
lies in repairing our own degeneration. I will return to this issue.

The topic of today's debate is the role of the  Child  Protection  Units  in
protecting our children. I want to raise a few points directly  relating  to
these units. Firstly, the  Family  Violence,  Child  Protection  and  Sexual
Offences Units of the SAPS, to name them accurately, are mainly reactive  by
the very nature of policing. There is very little that these  units  can  do
in the absence of evidence of a crime having been committed. To expect  them
to be proactive  in  protecting  our  children  is  unfortunately  not  very
realistic.

Secondly, there are currently 45 of these units, with another  five  in  the
process of being established. More units are planned  for  the  future.  The
IFP supports the establishment of more of these units with  better  staffing
and more resources. But, it is also very important to point out  that  these
units have successfully brought some  19 000  cases  to  court,  while  only
about 2 000 cases were finalised in 2002. The lack of success in  finalising
these cases in the criminal justice system  means  that  unit  officers  are
left with massive unfinished caseloads and numerous  delays  resulting  from
postponements in court appearances also means less time  spent  on  actually
investigating and solving new cases, leading to a general  deterioration  in
staff morale and motivation.

Notwithstanding the dedication and hard work of Child  Protection  Officers,
it is a sad reality that not even  establishing  one  such  unit  for  every
street in South Africa would solve the problem of sexual and other forms  of
violence against children. No, the solution lies much closer  to  home.  The
solution lies in repairing the damage to our moral and  social  fabric.  The
solution  lies  in  re-establishing  normal  and  acceptable  standards   of
behaviour, standards that can never include the  option  of  using  violence
under any circumstances. It lies in effectively addressing unemployment  and
poverty and it lies  in  tackling  issues  such  as  illegal  substance  and
alcohol abuse, something that we do not seem  to  be  terribly  keen  on  in
South Africa to look at.

In order to repair our scarred society, we need a collective effort  by  the
community, our leaders,  our  churches,  our  civic  organisations  and  our
parents. In fact,  every  single  South  African  can  and  has  to  make  a
contribution to the pressing national objective of healing our society.  The
contribution can be of any size or shape, but we should realise that  it  is
our collective responsibility to make a difference.

In last year's debate, Dr Buthelezi stated that we need to bring  about  the
spirit of a revolution of goodwill, in which we all become  responsible  for
making a  difference.  Today,  this  statement  is  still  as  accurate  and
relevant as ever. It is up to each  and  every  one  of  us  to  accept  our
national duty and responsibility to translate  the  revolution  of  goodwill
into a healing and caring  society  where  our  children  are  nurtured  and
cherished and not brutalised and traumatised.

If we do not accept this responsibility, we run the  risk  of  allowing  the
moral decay in our society to become endemic  to  the  extent  that  it  can
never again be repaired. I personally believe we are  frightfully  close  to
that.

Mnr J SCHIPPERS: Adjunkvoorsitter, weens die feit dat mens van die  geboorte
tot  volwassenheid  'n   ontwikkelingsperiode   deurmaak,   moet   die   reg
voorsiening maak vir 'n groot aantal reëls om die  regsposisie  van  kinders
te organiseer.

Die betrokkenheid van kinders by misdaad moet  in  twee  kategorieë  verdeel
word. Enersyds, misdaad deur kinders gepleeg en andersyds, misdaad wat  teen
kinders gepleeg word.

Vandag se onderwerp handel oor misdaad teen  kinders,  wat  uitsluitlik  die
funksie van die beskermingseenhede is. Dié eenheid vorm deel van  'n  groter
struktuur,   naamlik    die    Familiegeweld-,    Seksuele    Misdaad-    en
Kinderbeskermingseenheid.

Op 20 September 2002 het die agb Alie  van  Jaarsveld  vraag  1443  aan  die
Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit gevra:

1.(a) Hoeveel poste is tans vakant by die kinderbeskermingseenhede  in  elke
        provinsie; en

   (b)      wanneer sal die vakante poste gevul word; en

2.    Of die Minister bereid is om 'n verklaring in dié verband te maak.

Die antwoord wat  die  agb  lid  ontvang  het  was  baie  duidelik  en  baie
pertinent en die lid het reeds die Minister daarvoor  bedank.  Die  Minister
sê in sy antwoord dat die huidige personeelkomponent van die  Familiegeweld-
,  Seksuele  Misdaad-  en  Kinderbeskermingseenhede  word  in  die   tabelle
voorsien. 'n Opsomming van die  tabelle  toon  dat  1 497  poste  in  die  9
provinsies goedgekeur is, waarvan 900 gevul en 597 nie  gevul  is  nie.  Dit
gee vir ons 'n onderbemansyfer van  40%  landwyd.  Die  provinsies  wat  die
ergste geraak word is: Limpopo met 'n onderbemansyfer van 73%,  Weskaap  met
72%, Mpumalanga met 58% en Noord-Kaap met 56%. Die Minister  sê  verder  dat
die kritiese korttermyn tekort aangespreek sal word deurdat  445  nuwe  lede
in die 2003/2004-boekjaar aangestel sal word om  direk  of  indirek  by  die
groter struktuur betrokke te wees.

Die Grondwet van Suid Afrika sê duidelik in seksie 28(1)(b)  dat  elke  kind
die reg het tot 'n familie of ouerlike sorg of toepaslike alternatiewe  sorg
as die kind uit die familie-omgewing verwyder  word.  Seksie  28(d)  sê  dat
kinders beskerm sal word teen enige vorm  van  mishandeling,  verwaarlosing,
misbruik of minderwaardige behandeling.

Hoe sê 'n moeder op die Kaapse Vlakte aan haar kind om nie by 'n maatjie  te
gaan speel nie, want jy sal deur 'n dwaalkoeël getref word as  bendes  onder
mekaar veg, soos dit gister in Steenberg met  Lulu  Apollis  en  Vrydag  met
Tyrone Steenkamp in Ravensmead gebeur het. Hoe sê 'n moeder  aan  haar  kind
om nie lekkers of geskenke by vreemdelinge  te  neem  nie,  anders  gaan  jy
verkrag en vermoor en jou lykie sal in 'n vlak graf gevind word. Hoe  sê  'n
moeder aan haar kind om veilig skool toe te gaan, en dan wreed  aangeval  of
vermoor word, of deur  'n  motor  omgery  word.  Ons  ouers,  veral  in  die
agtergeblewe gebiede wat deur misdaad en  armoede  geteister  word,  het  'n
uiters moeilike taak. Die  beskermingseenhede  moet  bemagtig  word  om  ons
kinders op straat en in die gemeenskap te beveilig.

Die probleme wat die eenhede in die gesig staar  is  legio.  Ek  noem  slegs
een: Die  forensiese  inligting  word  nie  met  die  grootste  omsigtigheid
behandel nie en die resultate is eers na maande beskikbaar. Die Nuwe NP  wil
langs hierdie weg ons diepste medelye aan die Apollis- en  Steenkampfamilies
betoon en mag die Here hulle troos.

Agb Minister, ons moet die gety van misdaad teen kinders omdraai.  Ons  moet
die bendegeweld stop. Ons moet die  verkragting  van  kinders  en  vroue  in
huise, skole en op strate stop. Dit is in u en u departement se hande om  'n
einde daaraan te bring.

Die Nuwe NP sal enige wetgewing steun om dit  'n  werklikheid  te  maak.  Ek
dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS: Deputy  Chairperson,  owing  to  the  fact  that  one  goes
through a developmental period from birth to adulthood, the law should  make
provision for a number of rules to organise the legal position of  children.


The involvement of children in crime should be divided into two  categories.
On the one hand, crimes committed by children and on the other hand,  crimes
committed against children.

Today's topic deals with crime against children, which  is  exclusively  the
function of  the  protection  units.  This  unit  forms  part  of  a  bigger
structure, namely the Family Violence, Sexual Offences and Child  Protection
Unit.

On 20 September 2002 the hon Alie van Jaarsveld asked question 1443  to  the
Minister of Safety and Security:

1.(a) How many posts are currently vacant at the child protection  units  in
        every province; and

   (b)      when will these vacant posts be filled; and

2.    Whether the Minister is prepared to make a statement in this regard.

The answer which the hon member received was very clear and  very  pertinent
and the member has already thanked the Minister for that. In his answer  the
Minister says that the current personnel component of the  Family  Violence,
Sexual Offences and Child Protection Units are provided in the schedules.  A
summary of the schedules shows that 1 497 posts  in  the  9  provinces  have
been approved, of which 900 have been filled and 597 have not  been  filled.
This gives us an understaffed figure of 40% nationwide. The provinces  which
have been the worst affected are: Limpopo with  an  understaffed  figure  of
73%, Western Cape with 72%, Mpumalanga with 58% and Northern Cape with  56%.
The Minister further says that the  critical  short-term  shortage  will  be
addressed by appointing 445 new members in the 2003/2004 financial  year  to
become directly or indirectly involved with the bigger structures.

The Constitution of South Africa clearly states  in  section  28(1)(b)  that
every child has the right to family care or  parental  care  or  appropriate
alternative care if the  child  is  removed  from  the  family  environment.
Section 29(d) says that children will  be  protected  against  any  form  of
maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation.

How does a mother on the Cape Flats tell her child not to  go  play  with  a
playmate, because you will be  hit  by  a  stray  bullet  when  gangs  fight
amongst each other, as happened yesterday in  Steenberg  with  Lulu  Apollis
and Friday with Tyrone Steenkamp in Ravensmead. How does a mother  tell  her
child not to take sweets or gifts  from  strangers  otherwise  you  will  be
raped and murdered and your little body will be found in  a  shallow  grave.
How does a mother tell her child to go to school safely and then  the  child
is brutally attacked or  murdered  or  run  over  by  a  car.  Our  parents,
especially in the disadvantaged areas which  are  devastated  by  crime  and
poverty, have an extremely difficult task. The protection  units  should  be
empowered to be able to protect our  children  on  the  street  and  in  the
community.

The problems which stare the units in  the  face  are  innumerable.  I  name
merely one: The forensic  information  is  not  handled  with  the  greatest
circumspection and the results are only available months later. Along  these
lines the New NP would like to express its deepest sympathy to  the  Apollis
and Steenkamp families and may the Lord comfort them.

Hon Minister, we must turn the tide of crime against children. We must  stop
the gang violence. We must stop the rape of  children  and  women  in  their
houses, schools and on the streets. It is in  the  hands  of  you  and  your
department to bring an end to this.

The New NP will support any legislation to make  this  a  reality.  I  thank
you.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Chairperson and hon  Minister,  the  investigation  and
report by Mr Waters should not be ignored. It should also  not  be  used  to
score political points. It contains  valuable  information  that  should  be
used to inform the Minister of Finance, Minister  of  Safety  and  Security,
Minister of Justice and the National Commissioner of the SAPS. The  Minister
of Finance should take note and make provision for  the  critical  shortages
in a dedicated budget allocation. Both the  Ministers  for  Justice  and  of
Safety and Security should use the information to inform their own  policies
and the National  Commissioner  in  determining  priorities  and  allocating
human and other resources. We cannot plead lack of resources and  then  open
a special court to deal with poaching,  as  was  done  last  week,  and  not
prioritise a legal system that adequately addresses  the  special  needs  of
the child victim.

The debate before the House today is, in essence, a sad one.  The  necessity
for any parliament wherever it may be in  the  world  to  entertain  such  a
debate is a serious charge against the entire community,  yes,  against  the
nation as a whole. Children are indeed the most vulnerable  members  of  our
society. We also claim sometimes in cliché that the children  are  our  most
valuable resource for the future. If we all agree on this, why  is  it  then
that we neglect them? Why are we as individuals, communities,  indeed  as  a
nation, the authors and the creators of a legacy that we will be judged on?

I am using the word ``we'' deliberately. There is no  question  in  my  mind
that to fight incidents where children are the victims, a holistic  approach
is needed. The work of the CPUs happens after the fact that  the  child  has
already become a victim. What I am pleading for  is  an  approach  where  we
prevent the child becoming a victim. In order to achieve this, we  need  the
involvement of all relevant Government departments, civil  society  and  the
nation as a whole. Education should go beyond teaching children about  their
rights.  It  should  also  instil  in  children,  at  the  right  age,   the
responsibilities that come with parenthood.

The Department of  Social  Development  should  start  acting  as  an  early
warning system. They should identify children that are more likely,  because
of their  circumstances,  to  become  victims  and  develop  strategies  for
intervention at an early stage. Closer co-operation with the SAPS is a  must
and non-negotiable. Civil society and  our  communities  should  become  our
first line of defence. They must speak out, protect  and  get  involved.  We
cannot turn a blind eye. Having knowledge of children who are  at  risk  and
not acting on it makes society co-responsible.

Madam Speaker, this ANC Government successfully defeated apartheid  and  led
us into a democratic society. We ask now that  it,  with  the  same  vigour,
demonstrate the political will to put an end to these barbaric incidents  in
our society.

Mr F T MASERUMULE: Chairperson, this morning when I was  about  to  complete
my preparation for  this  debate,  I  realised  that  I  had  run  short  of
something. There is an expression in  the  African  culture  which  is  only
available in Sepedi. I tried to check if we have that expression in  English
and found out that we do not. I am going to  try  my  best.  The  expression
says `Motswa-leeto tlama setlhako sa ga-Ramakgokela gobane moo o  ya  go  ke
kgole fela o tla fihla mosepedi ga a  lape'.  [Applause.]  It  simply  says,
``it has been a very long journey but ultimately we have arrived at a  point
where we are able to say opportunities are there now for all of us to  begin
to address the ills of this legacy we inherited.''
If I was born and brought up in the same environment which Mr  Waters  comes
from, with the same background  and  same  ideology,  as  a  young  MP  like
himself, I would have been more wiser. [Laughter.] I am  not  querying  your
right to say what you want to say, but what I am querying is the  manner  in
which you are saying it and what you want to get from what you  are  saying.
You should be warned that we are dealing here with child  abuse  and  sexual
offences. For your own information, if you do not know, this issue  is  even
more emotional than the land question itself. [Interjections.]

You cannot begin to politicise and electioneer on an issue of  this  nature.
[Interjections.] As a grassroots activist, those  who  remember  vividly  in
their pretty minds what the President said at this  podium  in  1996  during
the adoption of the new Constitution, to those  who  care  to  remember.  He
said: `I am an African'', and if I remember well,  every  single  leader  in
this House made the same declaration. Do you know what  that  means  in  the
African culture? When a child is born, it is born into a network  of  aunts,
uncles, relatives and neighbourhood in a normal African family situation.

The point is, while we do appreciate the efforts and the attempts and  while
the police do need my pleas and yours, at the same  time,  as  Africans,  we
have a responsibility to create an environment in  this  network  of  uncles
and aunties in a neighbourhood and it is incumbent upon all of  us  to  make
it easy for the police to do their work; to create an  environment  where  a
child  can  live  and  grow  up  peacefully.  [Applause.]  Those  who   know
dialectical materialism will remember that it is said  in  dialectics:  ``If
you are on the left and you run out of ideas, you want to move  the  extreme
left to end up on the right and once you are on the right, in order for  you
to survive, you must lie and use violence''. [Interjections.]

This is exactly what Hitler used to do. Hitler's motto was `A lie told  many
times becomes the truth.' I  am  not  so  worried  whether  the  police  are
failing or succeeding. That is not my worry. My worry is what  I  myself  as
an individual - where I am staying and living on a  day-to-day  basis  -  am
doing to make sure that the Letsema campaign, Imbizo, Farhanani,  Ditirisano
and Moral Renewal Regeneration is working. [Applause.] That is my  worry.  A
word of comradely advice to those who want to be advised: I  am  sure  those
who do not know ANC well should know it now because they have been  given  a
chance to know it. What is left is for them to understand it even better.

The ANC is built like a family  because  a  branch  is  like  a  fundamental
organ, like a family. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, unfortunately,  Mr  Waters  is  not  part  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Safety and Security. He is missing a lot of  this  information.
Two weeks ago we met the human resource unit of SAPS. We also met  with  ICD
last week and this morning we engaged with the national  management  of  the
SAPS. I was really surprised at how the police themselves were  so  open.  I
do not know now why we should go about and  research  about  what  they  are
doing because they were so open about it. Another warning to Mr  Waters:  If
you want your DP organisation to become once more the next largest  minority
in this Parliament ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Deputy Chairperson, according to statistics,  there  is  a
rape or attempted rape of a child every 12  minutes  in  our  country.  More
than 120 000  children  were  raped  and  abused  over  a  21-month  period,
resulting only in an 8% conviction rate. The CPUs  which  were  designed  to
combat this growing plague are failing to make an impact and stem  the  tide
of this crime against humanity.

However, this is not through a fault of their own. The CPUs are filled  with
dedicated, yet demoralised police officers who work very long hours to  cope
with the workload. They continue to work  in  appalling  conditions  with  a
lack of basic resources such as manpower, vehicles and operating expenses.

How can an officer with about 100 cases that must be investigated at a  time
do justice to his or her  job?  Consequently,  because  of  this  and  other
reasons, the CPUs dismally fail to  protect  our  children.  Our  Government
must admit that their liberal laws have betrayed South African children.

At the root of the problems faced  by  the  CPUs  is  not  only  a  lack  of
resources, but the atmosphere this  Government  has  created  that  produces
criminals and perpetrators of these heinous crimes against our children.

By legalising pornography, which inflames the passion of lust  in  men,  the
incidents of the rape of children have been  increasing.  As  we  have  said
before, pornography is the theory but rape is the action.

The ACDP calls on Government to pass  legislation  that  would  require  all
Internet service providers to be registered so that they can  be  regulated.
The public must know which service  providers  are  endorsing  and  allowing
child pornographers  to  use  their  services  so  that  they  can  be  held
accountable for the damage  caused  by  their  service.  There  are  immoral
undisciplined lawyers in this  country  who  made  an  arrangement  with  an
orphanage in Pretoria to use the services of orphans  under  their  care  to
produce child pornography.

It is a shame and a disgrace that children who must be protected by  society
are being used by greedy lawyers  who  are  only  interested  in  satisfying
their lust and greed. The ACDP calls for  such  legal  practitioners  to  be
scrapped from the roll and never  to  be  allowed  to  practice  law  again.
[Applause.]

Mrs M A SEECO:  Chairperson,  according  the  hon  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security, there are currently 32 Child Protection Units  which  received  18
737 cases, comprising 4 031 enquiries and 14 706 dockets  for  investigation
in the last six months of 2002. A total of 52 life sentences  were  imposed,
and there were 1 013 cases of crime against children under  the  age  of  18
years.

The worst type of child abuse is that which  happens  in  the  home,  behind
closed doors. There is no specialised unit that can ever effectively  combat
this abuse and protect children without the co-operation of  the  community.
This includes making members of the public aware  of  each  and  everybody's
role in combating crime and protecting children.

Police members that are  allocated  to  these  units  should  specialise  in
psychology services to enable them to talk the  language  of  the  children.
The role of the units should involve the services of social workers.  Police
stations should have their people in the service.

Rona jaaka setshaba sa Afrika re boele morago  re  itekole,  re  tshwane  le
koko fa e elama ditsuane go di sireletsa.  Bana  ke  setshaba  sa  ka  moso.
[Legofi.] [We as the African nation  should  go  back  and  engage  in  some
introspection, just like when a hen protects its  young.  The  children  are
tomorrow's future. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chairperson, the MF denounces  all  forms  of  child
abuse and urges the protection of the children of our  nation.  In  summary,
according to the hon Waters, Child Protection Units are  reported  as  being
understaffed and the officers are overworked. They have between  60  to  100
cases as opposed to the acceptable 18 dockets per officer that  they  should
have.  More  crucial  is   that   many   lack   specialised   training.   In
Pietermaritzburg, 84% of officers have no  specialised  training  or  trauma
support services.

Arising from the hon Waters'  report,  the  MF  feels  that  the  department
should seriously look into the fact of the matter.  Child  Protection  Units
are extremely important. We need to ensure resources to the sector  so  that
needs may be met. The MF supports  initiatives  to  institute  adequate  and
efficient Child Protection Units.

The MF  acknowledges  the  department's  hard  work  and  commitment.  Child
Protection Units are a major  service  to  the  South  African  people,  and
service delivery appears hindered by minimal resources. The MF  pleads  that
the budget allocated to this sector assist in overcoming this shortfall.

Thank you, hon Minister, for highlighting the initiative that  is  taken  by
the department in training personnel in the Child Protection Units.

The MF is quite impressed by the Bulgarian child  protection  state  policy,
where a national council for child protection service is  the  state  agency
for child protection. As members of Parliament, I think we should look  into
all initiatives and assist our police department and Child Protection  Units
through community unity. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I think you are  becoming
a little too rowdy here. I appreciate  your  good  behaviour  for  all  this
while. We have just another 20 minutes to go. If you will  oblige  and  keep
the House in good order.

Adv P S SWART: Chairperson, I am stunned and shocked  at  the  way  the  ANC
treated the serious report by a committed member of this House.  [Applause.]
Normally, the hon Maserumule is quiet in our  portfolio  committee.  I  just
want to tell him today that hon Waters  is  not  a  member  of  a  portfolio
committee. It wasn't his job to go around  this  whole  country  during  the
recess and visit all the CPUs. He did it because he cares. [Applause.]

Most of us are parents. And if asked about our  biggest  treasure,  we  will
all state unequivocally that our children are  most  precious  to  us.  Even
those without children, like the hon Waters, will support this sentiment.

En dit  is  presies  hoekom  hierdie  debat  of  die  nodigheid  daarvan  so
ontstellend is. Ons is altyd vinnig om  lippediens  te  betoon  aan  hierdie
beginsel, om filosofies te verklaar:``The level of civilisation is  measured
by the way in which it treats its children.''

Maar hierdie is nie die eerste debat oor ons kinders in  hierdie  Huis  nie.
Dit is sekerlik ook nie die laaste  nie.  Die  klem  mag  skuif  van  morele
oplewing tot by die  verkragting  van  ons  kinders,  of  soos  vandag,  die
kinderbeskermingseenhede, maar die blote nodigheid hiervoor  onderstreep  'n
siek verrotting in ons samelewing. Dit is die hoofklag teen ons vandag.

As individue gee ons om vir ons kinders, maar  kollektief,  in  besonder  in
hierdie Huis, blyk ons nie in staat nie of onwillig om ons woorde  met  dade
te volbring. Ons skree ``wolf, wolf!'' oor die verkragting en  misbruik  van
ons kinders, maar ontbreek die politieke wil om vinnig en  effektief  op  te
tree om hierdie spiraal van geweld te breek.

Ek was verstom toe die agb Minister  tydens  die  GCIS  se  mediakonferensie
beweer het dat  hy  in  die  media  van  die  Watersverslag  moes  hoor.  Sy
departement is immers die eerste linie van  verdediging  teen  misdade  teen
ons kinders en daardie eenhede heel voor. 'n  Opposisieverslag  behoort  nie
die mannekragtekorte uit te wys nie. Hy moes  binne  dae  nadat  hy  sy  pos
aanvaar het, dit vasgestel en reggestel het. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Behalwe vorige vrae en voorstelle in hierdie Huis het ek  in  Augustus  2002
'n brief aan  die  Minister  geskryf  om  probleme  uit  te  lig  en  sekere
aanbevelings te maak. 'n Amptelike brief en nie 'n brief in die  media  nie.
Geen ontvangserkenning. Ek  wag  steeds  op  'n  antwoord.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[And that is precisely why this debate or its necessity is so upsetting.  We
are  always  very  quick  to  pay  lip-service   to   this   principle,   by
philosophically declaring:" The level of civilisation  is  measured  by  the
way in which it treats its children."

But this is not the first debate about our children in  this  House.  It  is
also certainly not the last. The emphasis may move  from  moral  revival  to
the rape of our children or, like today, the  child  protection  units,  but
the mere necessity for this highlights a sick decay in our society. That  is
the main accusation against us today.

As individuals we care about our children, but collectively,  in  particular
in this House, we appear to be either unable  or  unwilling  to  fulfil  our
words by means of deeds. We shout "wolf,wolf!" about the rape and  abuse  of
our children, but lack the political will to act  fast  and  effectively  in
order to break this spiral of violence.

I was astounded  when  the  hon  Minister  alleged  during  the  GCIS  media
conference that he had to hear about the Waters report  in  the  media.  His
department is surely the first line of defence against  crimes  against  our
children and those units at the very front. An opposition report should  not
point out  the  shortages  in  people  power.  He  should,  within  days  of
accepting his post, have established and rectified it. [Interjections.]

Apart from previous questions and proposals in this House I wrote  a  letter
to the Minister in August 2002  to  point  out  problems  and  make  certain
recommendations. An official letter and  not  a  letter  in  the  media.  No
acknowledgement of receipt. I am still waiting for an answer.]

But maybe this attitude is best described in remarks to the  Pretoria  Press
Club on 10 May 2002, during his first week in office. When  questioning  the
figure that one in three South African children were  abused,  the  Minister
said and I quote, ``Is that realistic? I have more than  three  children  at
home and yesterday not one was abused.'' It  sounded  like  Minister  Maduna
claiming that, and I quote, ``We have been standing here for 26 seconds  and
nobody has been raped,'' when he was questioned about  the  rape  statistics
on American TV.

However, the problem is much bigger than just  Cabinet's  apparent  lack  of
commitment. Hidden in the statistics are very ominous  indicators.  Analysis
of dockets indicates that in almost 90% of child rapes,  the  offenders  are
known to the victims, often being family members, especially uncles.  Almost
40% of cases are withdrawn within 48 hours with more before  the  case  goes
to court. This indicates, to our shame, a high  level  of  tolerance  and/or
condonation within society itself.

We have lost a  generation  due  to  the  atrocities  of  apartheid.  Today,
through our inaction, we are sacrificing another generation to  the  monster
of child rape and abuse.  The  very  least  we  can  do  is  to  ensure  the
sufficient staffing and resourcing of our CPUs, those dealing with the  most
unfortunate in our society, the innocent and  vulnerable  children,  victims
of crimes, often too young to understand what happened to them. This  proper
staffing shouldn't necessitate a debate. It should always have been a  given
to us.

Let our epitaphs not read, ``They said they cared, but then,  they  did  not
act.''

``Ubuntu'' beteken in besonder, om die agb Seremane se welbekende spreuk  te
gebruik: Jou kind is my kind. [``Ubuntu'' specifically  means,  to  use  the
hon Seremane's well-known saying: Your child is my child.]

Let us live this through proper deeds, not hollow words. On  behalf  of  the
children of South Africa: Thank you, hon Waters. [Applause.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Deputy Chairperson, hon members, I rise  on  behalf  of  the
majority party, the ANC, to add  our  voice  to  the  clarion  call  against
violence on the most vulnerable in our midst, namely, our children.

In doing so, I wish  to  echo  the  sentiments  of  our  President  who,  in
launching the 16-day campaign against violence against  women  and  children
towards the end of last year, had the following to say:


  Our country is involved in the important 16 days of activism on  violence
  against women and children. The country's response to this critical issue
  has been most commendable. We take this opportunity  to  thank  everybody
  who has taken this campaign seriously, including the mass media. The  16-
  day period will end on 10 December, International Human Rights Day.


  The point, however, is that having mounted the continuing  offensive  for
  the protection of the lives, safety and security, dignity and welfare  of
  the women and children of our country, we should not terminate  our  work
  on this matter when the 16-day period ends.


  We will have to continue beyond this date to ensure that  we  bring  down
  the levels of violence against women and children to  lower  levels  than
  those that obtain today. A critical element of  this  is  sustaining  the
  public consciousness in all our  communities  and  localities  about  the
  challenge we continue to face.

He then continued, and I quote:


  This will require that we get a better understanding of the incidence  of
  this crime in our country. In our continued  work,  we  should  look  for
  concrete results. One concrete result must be a radical reduction of  the
  numbers of victims of these  crimes.  Another  must  be  a  major  upward
  movement with regard to the overall climate of safety and security as  it
  relates to women and children  in  particular,  and  all  our  people  in
  general.


  These results must come about in part because  the  wrongdoers  begin  to
  understand that they will  not  get  away  with  their  crimes.  This  is
  particularly important because much of the abuse to which the majority of
  our people are firmly opposed occurs behind the closed  doors  of  family
  homes. Accordingly, we have to ensure that the united voice of our people
  against violence against women and children penetrates into and is  heard
  in the very private homes within which the  women  and  children  of  our
  country are abused.

I must, at this point, state that the calling for this debate today  by  the
DP, following the recent publication of its so-called report  on  conditions
and activities of Child  Protection  Units  with  the  theme,  and  I  quote
``South Africa's  betrayed  children  -  Government's  broken  promise''  is
hardly surprising considering the fact that  the  2004  elections  are  just
around the corner. [Interjections.]

In the aforesaid report, the DP has attempted to mount a scathing attack  on
Government to try and convince the electorate that this  a  government  that
simply does not care by saying the following, amongst others, and I quote:
  Of critical importance, we want to draw the attention of  the  public  to
  lack of willpower and of the impotence of the ANC Government in  ensuring
  that police are capable of helping child victims.


  Government efforts have amounted to a little more than ineffectual  noisy
  gongs and clanging bells.

[Interjections.]

I can simply respond to these unfortunate  utterances  by  alluding  to  the
words of Shakespeare's Macbeth by saying they are  simply  ``full  of  sound
and fury signifying nothing''.

As the Minister of Safety  and  Security  has  already  responded  to  these
accusations as they pertain to the police, let  me  confine  myself  to  the
role of the justice system and the efforts of Government  towards  enhancing
the capacity of that system to deal with this challenge more effectively.

A key initiative by  both  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development and the National  Prosecuting  Authority  to  address  the  area
especially of sexual offences  against  women  and  children  has  been  the
launching and  rolling  out  of  specialised  sexual  offences  courts.  The
intricate  nature  of  sexual   offences   against   women   and   children,
particularly because of their  intimate  nature,  requires  magistrates  and
prosecutors to be especially sensitive to the needs of  survivors  of  these
crimes.

Moreover, the scientific and  complex  nature  of  the  evidence  needed  to
secure convictions requires all role-players to have specialised skills  and
expertise.  Hence  the  establishment  of  these  courts.  Among  the   more
essential requirements of these courts are a minimum of  two  dedicated  and
experienced prosecutors per court; dedicated  and  experienced  magistrates;
victim assistance services; case managers;  a  pool  of  intermediaries  and
counselling services;  special  courtrooms  fully  equipped  with  essential
facilities such  as  closed  circuit  television  sets;  waiting  rooms  for
children and adults away from the suspects; private consultation areas,  and
anatomical  dolls  to  enable  young  children  to  testify  in   a   manner
appropriate to their age.

Twenty-nine of these courts have already been established to  date  and  are
currently functioning throughout the country. Eleven  more  are  due  to  be
launched by April this year. According to  the  statistics  applied  by  the
National Prosecuting Authority for the  period  January  to  December  2002,
derived from 10 of these courts which are located in Parow,  Cape  Town  and
Wynberg in the Western Cape; Pretoria and Protea  in  Gauteng;  Bloemfontein
and Welkom in the Free  State;  Port  Elizabeth  in  the  Eastern  Cape  and
Thohoyandou in the Northern Province, there were 1 711 cases finalised  with
full verdicts, of which  1  095  were  convictions  and  the  remaining  616
acquittals. In addition, the total number of cases withdrawn  was  935,  far
less than the 1 711 that were finalised.

This is clear evidence that the system is working, and that a clear  message
is being sent to perpetrators of crimes against women and children that  the
vigilant eyes of the law are upon them, and that they will  not  be  allowed
to continue with their evil ways unchecked.

Allow me to reiterate the President's call for communities to roll up  their
sleeves and participate in this collective effort  to  fight  this  scourge.
Government alone cannot  overcome  the  challenge.  We  all  come  from  our
respective families and communities from which these challenges  arise,  and
are all, therefore, equally responsible and accountable  in  ensuring  that,
as people and as a nation, we isolate those amongst us who have  become  the
rotten potatoes and resuscitate our family and social values.

Children play a pivotal role in perpetuating human existence.  Without  them
humanity will simply cease to exist. They carry the values,  traditions  and
human practices that are passed on from one generation to  the  next.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: There is a document that I am going  to
circulate to members of the Portfolio  Committee  on  Safety  and  Security.
This document is going to indicate the real state  of  play  in  our  police
stations. I want to pick up on only a  few  of  these  police  stations  and
areas because someone did refer to them.

The first case is that of Limpopo. Someone spoke about Limpopo in  reference
to a question that I had to respond  to.  In  Limpopo,  we  have  90  police
stations. Our contingent of members there is 9 028, made  up  of  functional
police members as well as  civilians  and  reservists.  There  are  four  CP
units. [Interjections.] There are four, and the total number of  members  in
these units is, at the moment, 51. In future, we will have  146  members  in
these units. The 51 members have 18 vehicles available to them, but when  we
have 146 members, they will have 73 vehicles. You will  see  when  you  read
this report that, in each case, there will be one vehicle  for  two  members
of these units.

The next point mentioned was the Western Cape. In the Western Cape, we  have
136 police stations, and  we  have  12  205  members,  including  functional
police officials, civilians and reservists. There are two CP units  with  46
members based in Goodwood, Mitchells Plain and Southern Cape. We  are  going
to push this number to 138. The 46 members are served by  24  vehicles,  but
when we have 138 members,  there  will  be  69  vehicles.  It  is  the  same
proportion - one vehicle to two members.

In Mpumalanga, there are 100 police stations with 6  383  members  composed,
as I have already indicated, of four CPUs with 39 members.  In  the  future,
there will be 94 members served by 47 vehicles.

This document, as  I  said,  will  be  made  available  to  members  of  the
portfolio committee. The reason we are  making  this  available  to  you  as
members of the portfolio committee is so that  you  can  interact  with  the
units where they are based, and check what the real situation  is  in  these
provinces in regard to this matter.

I owe Mr Waters an appointment. He wrote asking to see me, but at the  time,
it had already been indicated to me that we were going to have this  debate.
I suggested that my office should get back to him and  indicate  that  I  am
ready to meet with him, but that we should meet  after  this  debate.  I  do
want to meet, because I want us to interact on the basis of the report  that
you have. [Applause.]

I find it rather strange that someone like the hon  Paul  Swart  would  come
here and actually launch an attack on me. He says, firstly, that he wrote  a
letter and that I did not respond to the letter. He says  that  this  is  my
character. Obviously, it's informed by some attitude which  I  displayed  at
some point. I meet with the hon Swart. The hon Swart interacts with me on  a
number of issues. I don't know about the letter that he  is  talking  about.
[Interjections.]

Secondly, they are talking about this report. I will tell you what  happened
here. They released this report to the media,  and  I  got  a  copy  of  the
report a week later. That is the position. [Interjections.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: I have a point of order.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, Minister! What  is  your  point
of order?

Mrs S V KALYAN: I rise on a point of order: An hon member on the other  side
called the hon Paul Swart a liar.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is there any hon member ...

Mrs S V KALYAN: I also have a second point of order.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: First, let us dispense with the  first
one.  Was  there  any  hon  member  who  called  the  hon  Swart   a   liar?
[Interjections.]

Hon member, what is your second point of order? [Interjections.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: The second point of order  is  the  persistence  of  certain
members in this House to continuously meow at me whenever  I  stand  up  and
make a point. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, we have a ...

Mrs S V KALYAN: We have a ruling in this House on this,  and  I  would  like
you to rule on that again. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, there is a ruling in  the  House,
and if anyone ... [Interjections.] Order! Hon members, you are very free  to
make interjections, but when it comes  to  certain  expressions,  there  are
certain expressions which are very offensive in their very  nature,  and  we
have had a ruling on that. I  think  it  is  imperative  that  every  single
member of this House upholds  the  ruling  in  order  that  we  can  have  a
Parliament which is a dignified Parliament.

I cannot rule in general terms unless we know who the offending  party  was.
[Interjections.]  I  would  like  to  admonish  you  generally  that  it  is
unacceptable,  and  I  would  like  you,  therefore,  to  ensure  that   the
proceedings in this House go along in a dignified manner.

Hon Minister, you may proceed.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: All documents that I get at  my  office
- I am sure this is the same with every member here  who  has  an  office  -
will reflect a date on which those documents were received. I will show  you
the date when we meet, Mr Waters, on  which  we  received  the  document.  I
still want to contend that that document was given to me later than  it  was
released to the media. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                          GEOSCIENCE AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

There was no debate.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 18:54.

Papers:

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter dated 5 March  2003  from  the  Minister  of  Transport  to  the
     Speaker, tabled in terms of section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public  Finance
     Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the  delay  in  the
     tabling of the following annual reports:


         Department of Transport


         A large volume of audit evidence was requested from the  Department
         on 11 July 2002 and documents were supplied  for  audit  until  the
         auditors finalised their audit.


         A first draft Audit Report was only received on 22 August 2002  and
         discussed at an Audit Committee meeting on 27 August 2002.  Because
         the Audit Report  contained  a  qualification  regarding  the  late
         submission  of  supporting  audit  evidence,  the  Audit  Committee
         decided that the Department should rather attempt  to  remove  this
         qualification and submit its Annual Report late than to accept  the
         qualification, because the Department was of the opinion  that  the
         evidence was indeed supplied during the audit.


         The Department then approved that the audit  work  should  continue
         as an attempt to resolve  the  qualification  in  the  draft  Audit
         Report. The audit was continued and resulted in  the  qualification
         being removed from the Audit Report.


         Cross Border Road Transport Agency


         The  financial  statements  were  supplied  on  31  May  2002,  but
         incorrect opening balances, emanating from 1998/99,  were  not  yet
         resolved and the financial statements did  not  fully  comply  with
         Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.


         An agreement was reached between the Agency and the Office  of  the
         Auditor-General  that  amended  financial   statements   would   be
         supplied for audit on 26 September 2002. This  caused  a  delay  in
         the  finalisation  of  the  audit  and  Annual  Report  within  the
         prescribed timeframes.


         Road Accident Fund


         The provision for outstanding claims has a material impact  on  the
         financial statements of the Road Accident Fund. The  Road  Accident
         Fund's internal actuary calculated  a  provision  for  the  2001/02
         financial statements, which would have  been  substantiated  by  an
         external report at a later stage. Due to  the  materiality  of  the
         provision,  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  insisted  on   a
         comprehensive  actuarial  report  from  external  actuaries  before
         finalising their audit. This report was only received on 16  August
         2002 and resulted in the late finalisation of the audit.


         South African Maritime Safety Authority


         In terms of section 55(b) of the Public Finance Management Act  the
         Accounting Authority must  approve  the  financial  statements.  No
         Board  meetings  were  however  held  to  approve   the   financial
         statements within the prescribed time frames.


         The Audit Management letter was only received on 8 August 2002  and
         the  first  draft  Audit  Report  on  16  August  2002.  The  Audit
         Committee took a  resolution  on  9  September  2002  that  certain
         issues be further investigated and cleared before the audit  report
         is finalised.


         S A National Roads Agency Ltd


         Information regarding  a  long-term  forecast  of  future  expected
         revenues and expenditures for the LSR (Loan Supported  by  Revenue)
         calculations, was only supplied for  audit  on  8  September  2002.
         Although  this  is  required  before  an  audit  opinion   can   be
         expressed, the information forms no part of the accounting  records
         and does not represent actual transactions.


         The Audit Management letter was only received  on  16  August  2002
         and a report on the review of the  Information  Technology  General
         Environment was only issued on 10 August 2002.  These  reports  had
         to be responded to before the audit could be finalised and  led  to
         the delay in finalising the audit.


         Urban Transport Fund


         The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2001  did  not
         comply with Generally Accepted Accounting  Practice  and  contained
         inconsistencies with the financial statements of previous years.


         A number of qualifications appeared in the draft Audit  Report  for
         the  year  ended  31  March  2001.  It   was   found   that   these
         qualifications were as a result of poor drafting of  the  financial
         statements and opening balances that were  not  correctly  captured
         in the ledger when the Urban Transport Fund  started  its  seperate
         accounting system with effect from 1 April 2000.


         The errors on the  financial  statements  were  corrected  and  the
         first draft Annual Report of the  Urban  Transport  Fund  for  both
         2001 and 2002, excluding the Audit Reports, were  supplied  to  the
         auditors on 19 September 2002 to  enable  them  to  finalise  their
         audits for both years.

2.    The Acting Minister of Transport:


     Report  to  the  National  Assembly  on  the  National  Land  Transport
     Transition Act, 2000 (NLTTA).


     Copies of the report is available at the Office of the Clerk of  Papers
     on request.
