silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The SPEAKER: We now come to the motion on the Order Paper.  Before  we  deal
with this, I need to advise you that earlier this  afternoon  I  received  a
letter from Mr Yengeni. It's very simple. He says:


  I forthwith resign from Parliament.

[Applause.]

In the light of this, I think this motion needs to be  reconsidered,  but  I
will proceed with the speakers' list on this matter.

             APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEE TO DEAL WITH YENGENI ISSUE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  on  28
March 2001, hon Tony Sithembiso Yengeni made a statement to this  House.  On
13 February 2003, Mr Yengeni pleaded guilty in the Regional  Court  for  the
Regional Division of the Northern  Transvaal  to  a  charge  of  fraud,  and
admitted that he had unlawfully and with intent to defraud  falsely  and  to
the prejudice of the Parliament of the Republic of South  Africa  failed  to
disclose that he had received a benefit in the form of a discount, and  made
a number of misrepresentations.

The ANC believes that in order to achieve a political order in South  Africa
that  is  open  and  transparent  and  accountable,  as  envisaged  in   the
Constitution, it is essential that the integrity of  public  representatives
and that of the  political  institutions  in  which  they  serve  be  beyond
question.

An HON MEMBER: Hear, hear!

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: The ANC  is  fully  committed  to  the
principles  and  practices  of  transparent  and   accountable   governance.
[Interjections.] We are committed to upholding and  defending,  among  other
things, the integrity of all public institutions,  and  this  Parliament  in
particular.

Therefore, the ANC views the above admissions made by Mr Yengeni in  a  very
serious light. And, in view of the above, the ANC believes that  Mr  Yengeni
has done the honourable thing  by  resigning  as  a  member  of  Parliament.
[Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, this  matter  will  not  be
finished until Parliament has expressed its opinion about  the  matter.  For
that reason, I think that we should adopt a motion, and I want to  move  the
following motion:


  That paragraphs 1 and 2 as printed on the Order Paper be followed by:


  (3) notes that Mr Yengeni today resigned from the National Assembly;


  (4) censures Mr Yengeni for abusing the protection of the  Chair  and  of
        the Rules to deliberately mislead the House with the  intention  of
        defrauding Parliament.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: In motivation of this motion,  I  want  to
state the following: Firstly, we note  that  Mr  Yengeni  has  resigned.  We
welcome that fact. We think he should have resigned weeks ago.

Why is it that the ANC's first reaction is always to close ranks around  the
corrupt and the crooks? Instead of setting an example  to  the  nation,  the
ANC seems always to side with those who've transgressed, and never seems  to
side with the honest people of our country.

You underestimate the anger of  ordinary  people  about  corruption  in  our
country  generally,  and   about   the   Yengeni   matter   in   particular.
[Interjections.] The message which goes out to the people is  that  the  ANC
does not act quickly and firmly and unflinchingly against those  who  should
be disciplined. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, Mr Gibson!

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Madam Speaker, I think the custodians ...

The SPEAKER: Mr Ramgobin, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr M RAMGOBIN: I'm rising on a point of order.

The SPEAKER: Will you please deal with the point of order!

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Is it parliamentary to impute  guilt  by  association,  Madam
Prime Minister, to  a  political  organisation  of  which  we  are  members?
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: I didn't hear anything unparliamentary, but I will look at  the
Hansard to see if there was.

Mr Gibson, I do, however, want to raise an issue  now  that  we've  stopped,
and that concerns the fact that you were moving an  amendment  to  a  motion
that has not been put to the House.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: No, Madam, I was not moving an  amendment.
I moved a motion.

The SPEAKER: So, you were moving a motion without notice?

The  CHIEF  WHIP  OF  THE  OPPOSITION:  I   am   moving   a   motion,   yes.
[Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, please! You cannot move a motion without  notice  unless
there is agreement. [Interjections.]

Are there objections to a motion without notice?

Hon MEMBERS: Yes!

The SPEAKER: Mr Gibson, you may speak to  whatever  statement  you  wish  to
make, because I did call you for that, but not move a motion.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam, the message which goes out  to  the
people is that the ANC ...

The SPEAKER: Before you proceed, I just wish to  make  clear  to  the  House
that there is no motion before the House. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: If that's what the House wants to do.

The message which goes out to the people  is  that  the  ANC  does  not  act
quickly  and  firmly  and  unflinchingly  against  those   who   should   be
disciplined. Instead, the ANC delays and delays and delays, hoping that  the
matter can be minimised or explained away or settled  behind  closed  doors.
[Interjections.]

Mr Yengeni should  have  resigned  the  moment  he  confessed  to  lying  to
Parliament with intent to defraud. Upon  his  failure  to  resign,  the  ANC
should have  used  its  power  to  fire  him  immediately.  [Interjections.]
Instead, it's being forced  to  act  under  duress  and  pressure  from  the
opposition, from civil  society,  from  the  media  and  from  the  Speaker.
[Interjections.] Confidence  in  Parliament  has  been  undermined,  because
there was no prompt response from the leadership of the party. The  ANC  and
all  parties  -  I  stress  ``all  parties''  -  need  to  learn  from  this
disgraceful episode. Swift action by leaders  retains  and  restores  public
confidence in politicians  when  the  few  corrupt  politicians  transgress.
[Interjections.]

Hon members also need to know that if one of them abuses the  protection  of
the Chair and abuses the protection of the Rules, and deliberately  misleads
the House, there is a heavy price to pay. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, the IFP welcomes the decision by the hon  Mr
Yengeni to resign. We feel it was the honourable thing to do at  this  time.
We also support the withdrawal of the motion which was on  the  Order  Paper
today.

The IFP feels sorry for Mr Yengeni on a personal level, and for  the  family
and also for the House for the difficulties caused.

The fact that Mr Yengeni has resigned allows  for  Parliament  to  leave  Mr
Yengeni's case with the courts  in  respect  of  sanctions  and  punishment.
[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, we welcome the resignation of  Mr  Tony  Yengeni
after admitting  that  he  misled  Parliament.  There  is  a  convention  in
parliaments across the world that, when something  like  this  happens,  the
member involved does the honourable thing by resigning.  In  doing  so,  the
member  protects  the  integrity  of  the  house  and  also  the   political
organisation to which he or she belongs.

The Speaker, Frene Ginwala, is to be congratulated on her  principled  stand
that the Yengeni issue must be dealt with efficiently and very  quickly.  It
has preserved the integrity of this Parliament.

When Mr Profumo, a member of the British Parliament, had an  affair  with  a
prostitute, tongues started wagging. In the time-honoured  English  way,  Mr
Profumo's issue would have been swept under the carpet, but Mr Profumo  made
a fundamental error - he lied to the House of Commons.  In  March  1963,  he
told  the  chamber  that  there  was  no  impropriety  whatsoever   in   his
relationship with Keeler. Ten weeks later, he appeared before the MPs  again
to say with deep remorse that  he  had  misled  the  House,  and  wanted  to
resign.

Mr Tony Yengeni admitted to serious indiscretions, and pleaded guilty  in  a
court of law. By resigning, he is doing the honourable  thing  -  protecting
the integrity of Parliament, respecting the people who  voted  for  him  and
honouring the political party that  sent  him  to  Parliament.  We  need  no
committee to ascertain the facts. Mr Yengeni has admitted guilt. He  should,
with deep remorse, apologise to Parliament and go.

In the words of Mr Manuel, ``It's the right thing to do.''  Politicians  who
lie to Parliament have only one avenue: They must exit the scene as soon  as
possible.

Mr C T FROLICK: Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members,  the  resignation  of  Mr
Yengeni is indeed the right thing to do, but it is a shame that it took  him
so long to decide to tender his resignation. It is  also  a  pity  that  the
Yengeni saga took so much of Parliament's time and that of its programme.

It  is  indeed,  in   the   first   place,   the   responsibility   of   all
parliamentarians,  irrespective  of  political  affiliation,   to   be   the
custodians of the credibility of the institution, and we have a duty to  the
people of South  Africa  to  be  accountable.  We  must  avoid  engaging  in
unnecessary processes and procrastination that could create  the  impression
that we are willing to turn a blind  eye  to  actions  that  undermine  this
institution.

We therefore  would  like  to  congratulate  you,  Madam  Speaker,  for  the
principled stance you have taken in dealing with this  matter.  Indeed,  you
have demonstrated your ability to act  above  party  politics  in  order  to
protect the integrity of this Parliament. [Applause.]

Mr  L  M  GREEN:  Madam  Speaker,  the  ACDP  welcomes  the  notice  of  the
resignation of the hon Yengeni.  We  believe  he  has  done  the  honourable
thing.
It is a sad matter to us that a member of Parliament's career comes  to  end
in such a manner. We as the ACDP do not rejoice in his fall.  It  is  a  sad
day for him. It is a sad day for his family, and it is a  sad  day  for  his
party.

Let this be a lesson to all of us to walk circumspectly,  never  to  mislead
the Speaker and this House. We commend the Speaker for the stance  that  she
took and the example that she set. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and hon members,  it  comes  as  no  surprise
that Mr Yengeni has eventually thrown in  the  towel  after  the  protracted
merry-go-round he led this House on. It is  the  most  honourable  thing  he
could have done to save this House from further disrepute.

In fact, the resignation is long overdue. It should have  happened  as  soon
as he was charged. While we remain with the mammoth task  of  restoring  the
pride and dignity of the House, we should learn from this experience.
All parties should resolve that never again  will  they  allow  a  situation
like this to develop; never again will they allow their members to  use  the
institution for personal aggrandisement at the  expense  of  Parliament  and
the entire nation.

Let us close the Yengeni chapter and start all over  again  to  rebuild  and
remould our brand, which is the Parliament of the Republic of South  Africa.
[Applause.]

The SPEAKER: I just wish to  apologise.  I  read  from  the  speakers'  list
without noticing who was rising ...

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, I never regretted  the  day  I  stood  up  in
Parliament three years ago to call for a  judicial  commission  of  inquiry.
Today I have been vindicated, thank God! [Applause.] Many  people  tried  to
cover up, including many members in this House, but there is  one  thing  we
must all learn - hon  Mr  Essop  Pahad  -  that  even  though  you  are  the
majority, you cannot suppress the truth. The truth will always survive;  the
truth will always triumph. [Interjections.]

I want to thank our independent judiciary for the sterling  work  that  they
are doing. We want to thank the Scorpions for the work that they are  doing.
Finally, Madam Speaker, we thank you for your courage in putting  your  foot
down and saying that he must resign. That was a good thing  to  do.  It  was
the  right  thing  to  do.  We  respect  you  for   that.   [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, not so long away, an  MEC  from  Mpumalanga
said ``Politicians may lie''. That is another way of  telling  a  politician
that he is likely to be protected by his party when he does so. We  say  No.
Politicians who lie and commit corruption must be expelled from their  party
and automatically from Parliament. The governing party  must  prove  to  the
nation that they can be trusted to take charge  of  the  moral  regeneration
programme by discharging corrupt members  from  their  ranks  and  not  even
allowing them to come back to the  precincts  of  Parliament.  Parties  must
suspend their members, and not ask Parliament to slap  the  hands  of  those
who  break  parliamentary  codes.  Government  has  already   spent   enough
taxpayers' money on Mr Yengeni and the court case. Why just  reprimand  him?
Why waste more of Parliament's time on a  member  who  admits  that  he  has
committed fraud and lied to the nation?

The FA appeals to all parties to give  status  and  respectability  back  to
Parliament by suspending the members of Parliament who  break  the  code  of
conduct. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, we've seen, in these two days, that  the  golden
rule in Parliament is: You return if you win your court case,  but  if  not,
you can't. [Interjections.]

It was the right thing to do for Mr Yengeni to resign.  I  do  not  want  to
throw punches at somebody who is no longer in the ring,  but  the  ANC,  its
leadership, and its Whippery is still in the ring, and I want to address  my
punches to them. Why did we get the impression  that  this  thing  would  be
swept under the carpet? Why the long delay? Why the motion to  resolve  this
thing behind closed doors, against what the Speaker had said?

May we learn from this that we must be open, that we must advance the  truth
and that Parliament and its ...

... waardigheid altyd behou moet word. [Applous.] [... dignity  must  always
be preserved. [Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: That brings us to the end of the speakers' list.

Before proceeding with the Order Paper, I do want to draw attention  to  the
fact that an important issue for the  integrity  of  Parliament  has  arisen
through this particular case. What remains to be done is  that  we  need  to
consider, independently of party-political positions, how Parliament  should
deal with cases where members deliberately mislead the House.

I hope we will return to that and look at it as a united Parliament.

                     VISITS TO MPUMALANGA AND FREE STATE

        (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee on Education)

Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker and hon members, from 22 to  24  July  2002
two multiparty delegations of the Portfolio Committee on Education, made  up
of five members and one official each, visited  Mpumalanga  and  Free  State
provinces respectively. Both provinces were invited to come to this  debate.
If they are represented here I would like to welcome their representatives.

In those three days they visited a total of 38 schools at a  cost  of  about
R140 000 of the taxpayers' money. The big question is whether  these  visits
added any value to the lives of our people. The answer is a big yes.

Recommendation (b) under Mpumalanga states,  and  I  quote:  ``Communication
between the MEC's office and the district officers, as well as  between  the
district officers and the schools, needs drastic improvement.'' There  is  a
big  communication  and  knowledge  gap  between  these  offices.   To   the
delegation's shock, the regional  and  district  officials  who  accompanied
them were equally surprised when the  schools  narrated  their  frustrations
about delivery. One could not help but feel that they  were  visiting  their
own schools for the first time with the delegation.

Our people in the communities are crying out for help. They  need  shoulders
to cry on. They expect us to stretch our hands of friendship and  attend  to
their queries. They expect us to enlighten them on  the  rules  that  govern
their institutions.

Ngelishwa, abantu bakuthi  abakakhululeki  nangona  uMgaqo-siseko  usixelela
ngokucacileyo  ukuba  sonke  siyalingana,   nokuba   unguMongameli,   nokuba
ungumphathiswa,  nokuba  ukhokela  isebe.  NgokoMgaqo-siseko  wethu,   sonke
siyalingana. Simele ukuba  sikwazi  ukubamba  ifoni  xa  sinengxaki,  sibuze
nakowuphi na umntu njengabemi beli lizwe. (Translation  of  Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[Prof S M MAYATULA: Unfortunately, our people are not yet free  even  though
the Constitution tells us clearly that we are all equal, whether you  are  a
President,  a  Minister  or  a  head  of  a  department.  According  to  the
Constitution of this country, we are all equal. As citizens of this  country
we therefore should be able to pick up the telephone when we have and  speak
to someone else.

Despite that, there is nothing as gratifying as receiving a  call  from  one
of the schools we visited, asking for assistance in one way or  another.  We
have experienced this in many instances. We have  managed  to  pass  on  the
information to  the  relevant  MECs  and  such  problems  were  attended  to
immediately, to the delight of the schools.

The members of the executive, whether at the provincial or  national  level,
with the best of intentions, cannot be everywhere.  They  also  need  us  as
members of this House to be their eyes and ears. We  cannot  do  that  while
seated in this Chamber. Let us go out and dirty our hands. Our  people  need
us.

Despite the many challenges facing these provinces, to which  we  are  going
to refer later - and the members of delegations are going to do  that  -  it
was exciting to learn that in  Mpumalanga,  for  example,  the  department's
budget for learner-support material, that is stationery and  textbooks,  has
increased by 100% from R68 million in 2001-02, to R136 million  in  2002-03.
Secondly, school transport was provided for only 400 learners in 1994.  This
increased to 2 700 in 2000, and to 6 800 in 2002 - an increase of 1 700%.

In the Free State, the delegation was so impressed by  the  role  played  by
some  of  the  farmers  in  the  education  arena  that  the  committee  has
recommended to the Minister that some of these farmers be  invited  to  come
and grace this House when he tables his budget.

On 4 November 2002, soon after receiving our draft report,  even  before  it
was officially tabled in the ATC, which was done on 13  December  2002,  the
MEC for education in Mpumalanga, Comrade  Padayachee,  graciously  responded
in writing and committed his department to attend to the  problems  of  each
of the schools we visited. To illustrate this point, I  will  now  refer  to
three such schools.

First is Silamba Senior Secondary  School.  One  of  its  problems  was  the
shortage of furniture. He responded, and I quote: ``The department  has  not
received requests for furniture from this school for 2002, but  it  will  be
purchased in 2003.''

On renovations and toilets, the MEC reports, and  I  quote:  ``The  regional
office will be requested to consider the prioritisation of  the  school  for
renovations and the provision of toilets next year.'' In this case, 2003.

Regarding Makerana Primary School, one of the schools we  visited,  the  MEC
had this to say, and I  quote:  ``The  quality  of  furniture  procured  for
schools, which is in accordance with SA Bureau of Standards  specifications,
will be purchased in 2003.''

Let me take the third and last school,  namely  Hlonipha  Secondary  School.
About the shortage of classrooms, the MEC had this  to  say,  and  I  quote:
``The regional office will be requested to consider  the  inclusion  of  the
school in the priority list for the 2003 school year for  the  provision  of
eight additional classrooms.'' On the shortage of furniture he had  this  to
say, and I quote: ``Furniture will be purchased for the school next  year.''


In most of these cases, owing to communication breakdown  and  the  lack  of
acceptance of the freedom that one has to  pick  up  a  phone  and  talk  to
whoever, many schools had not filled out the  necessary  requisition  forms.
As a result they were left in limbo. Thanks to  our  visit,  their  problems
will be attended to, as the MEC has indicated.

We are convinced that our recommendations, which are contained in  that  ATC
report, will strengthen the hands of both  the  national  Minister  and  the
MECs in their endeavours to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty.  This  is
part of our oversight and monitoring responsibilities.

I would like to thank the MECs, Comrade Kganare and  Padayachee,  and  their
officials for their  warm  welcome,  assistance  and  co-operation,  without
which these visits would have failed. A word  of  thanks  goes  to  all  the
schools we visited for giving us their time and for  sharing  their  dreams.
Together we can and will make a difference.

We would like to challenge  especially  members  from  Mpumalanga  and  Free
State to read this report  and  assist  us  to  monitor  the  situation.  As
indicated in the report, the committee will be  inviting  the  MECs  for  an
update on all these issues.

I would also like to commend the teams that visited  these  provinces.  They
were there not with different ideological mind-sets, but as a team in  order
to assist so that we can be in a position to do what we are supposed  to  do
- assist our people improve their lives. I thank you.

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Chairperson, my  colleague  the  hon  Ntuli,  who  is  our
spokesperson, cannot be with us this afternoon, so  I  am  standing  in  for
him.

It is sad to record that the  previous  government  regarded  education  for
black children as a privilege, not as a right. Black learners on farms  were
completely at the mercy of farm owners who could open a school on a farm  or
close it as they deemed fit. The net effect was that the farm school  system
was haphazard, fragmented and poorly co-ordinated.

While the physical conditions and provisioning of  farm  schools  reflect  a
significant improvement from the previous regime, there are certain  matters
that need redress. These include, firstly,  the  incredibly  long  distances
that many farm children have to walk to and from schools. This  ranges  from
eight kilometres, as is the case with learners at Bonong Primary School,  to
20 kilometres for some learners attending Hanover  Combined  School.  It  is
difficult to imagine how a  child  can  learn  effectively  when  physically
exhausted by the long walk. Coming  from  a  desperately  poor  family,  the
child is probably also very hungry.

Secondly, to aggravate matters, the child at school  is  often  deprived  of
his or her fair share of the primary school nutrition programme because,  in
many  cases,  there  is  no  proper  monitoring  of  the  delivery  of  food
materials, as well as how and when the food is distributed.

The other notable weakness in  the  farm  school  education  system  is  the
unavoidable multigrade tuition, unavoidable because of low  enrolment.  This
means that the teacher finds  himself  or  herself  handling  two  or  three
different grades of learners simultaneously, often in groups of  20  or  30.
What is problematic is not the number of class groups but  different  grades
of  learners  and,  consequently,  the  different  levels  of  intellectual,
emotional and knowledge-level backgrounds.
It must have been difficult enough under the previous traditional method  of
teaching which was teacher-oriented. How these teachers manage to cope  with
their present responsibilities operating with the  outcomes-based  education
methodology  is  beyond  comprehension.  However,  underpinning  all   these
problems is the virtual lack of any early  childhood  development  education
programme. This is because of a lack of funds and infrastructure to  put  it
into place.

It is envisaged by the  Free  State  education  authorities  officials  that
Grade R will be a compulsory year of schooling by the year  2008.  The  Free
State department would prefer to have the process completed by  the  end  of
2006. There does, however,  seem  to  be  one  possible  solution  to  these
problems. We need to move to a  hostel-based  system  of  education.  Busing
these children is just not economically viable, given the fluctuating  rural
school population and the ongoing process of urbanisation. The  hostel-based
school  system  at  certain  strategic  centres  will  have  the   following
advantages: it will,  in  the  long  run,  reduce  administrative  costs  by
pooling human resources, teachers and learners, and physical resources in  a
lesser number of central points; it will make  teaching  and  learning  more
effective by eliminating cumbersome multigrade teaching; it will  result  in
larger learner enrolment and a larger teaching corps, and  it  will  put  an
end to the daily stress and strain of learners  having  to  walk  or  travel
long distances to and from school.

But, Mr Minister, here I want to make an appeal: What we do not want is  for
schools to be closed  in  rural  areas  without  anything  being  put  as  a
replacement in its place. This has happened, and I can speak  from  personal
experience in the Eastern Cape.

Now, the urban community  surveyed  did  not  present  a  pleasant  picture.
Bethlehem Comprehensive School is a case in  point.  The  school  management
and teachers operate as they wish. Meetings are irregular  and  only  happen
when there is a crisis. According to the principal, the school  is  managing
absenteeism  and  teacher   performance,   yet,   some   teachers   reported
differently. The Grade 12 pass rate indicates something is  seriously  wrong
with the management of the school. The low pass rate of 34% in 1994, 30%  in
1995, 8% in 2000 and 24% in 2001 makes depressing reading. This is a  tragic
waste of children's learning time and taxpayers' money. The DA calls on  the
Department of Education to take drastic measures to remedy this crisis.

Yet, these sad experiences were mingled with elements  of  satisfaction  and
joy. For example, some white farmers have walked the extra mile  to  improve
the situation. Here, in this respect, the hon Mayatula also gave  credit  to
them.  They  have  improved  the  situation  by  offering   good   education
opportunities to their workers' children.

Moboloka Primary  School  is  situated  near  an  informal  settlement.  The
principal and staff are doing their best to help these  children  break  the
cycle of poverty and misery. What is more commendable is the fact  that  the
school is twinning with Eunice Secondary and Botlehadi  School,  both  being
better-resourced schools. In this  way,  the  schools  share  resources  and
knowledge, thereby jointly enhancing their service delivery.

We commend these men and women for their good work because, for  many  black
children, a sound education is the  only  escape  route  from  helplessness,
vulnerability  and  poverty.  We  are  indebted  to   Parliament   for   the
opportunity to  visit  provinces  and  acknowledge  the  kind  reception  we
received in those provinces. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Mr Chairperson, it is unfortunate that Mr Mpontshane  cannot
be here today. Since he was present on this visit and I wasn't, I  shall  be
his carbon copy today. Just consider me a messenger in the  classical  sense
of the word. Mr Mpontshane had the following to say.

The purpose of the visit was not a fault-finding mission, after all this  is
not the function of  the  committee.  Our  job  is  to  hold  the  executive
accountable. The hon Minister of  Education  presented  this  House  with  a
report on the conditions at schools. In this report  the  hon  the  Minister
painted a picture of the  infrastructure  which  was  improving,  but  which
still left a lot to be desired in the form of, inter alia, toilets,  running
water, electricity and transport for  learners.  The  committee,  therefore,
undertook to see for itself how the system was doing as  far  as  the  above
infrastructural conditions were concerned.

Another  aspect  of  the  system  which  concerned  the  committee  was  the
provision and supply of learner  materials  to  schools.  Hon  members  will
remember that the House did debate last year the chaotic  situation  in  the
Eastern Cape as far as this aspect was concerned. It  showed  the  committee
that the supply of learner support materials  to  schools  was  a  perennial
problem in the two provinces that we visited.

My party was represented on a team that went to  Mpumalanga.  Yes,  we  came
and we saw, but we did not conquer. The first weakness in  the  system  that
was common to all schools was accountability. Almost all schools we  visited
did not have learner  support  materials,  some  of  them  in  very  crucial
grades. Everybody, from the school principals to  the  office  of  the  MEC,
gave contradictory reasons as to why books were not delivered.  The  glaring
cause, however, was that those who had been awarded tenders to  deliver  the
material did not have the capacity to deliver. We  would  therefore  propose
that we eliminate the intermediaries. Let schools order  straight  from  the
supplier. We believe this system would improve the situation.

A second weakness we observed is that of  discipline.  Where  discipline  is
nonexistent it leads to many other evils,  namely  absenteeism,  drug  abuse
and a high failure rate.  The  hon  the  Minister  should  exercise  serious
thoughts about TV shows such as Yizo Yizo. My colleagues will  confirm  that
we saw this programme being replayed in one of the schools we  visited.  The
hairstyles, dress and language was unbelievable. Even the  principal  had  a
certain type of uniform on that conforms with something from Yizo  Yizo.  We
plead with the Minister  to  remove  some  of  these  false  ``educational''
shows. They are having an unintended influence in our  schools.  Instead  of
bringing about moral development, they bring moral decay.

One of the  programmes  of  the  department  has  been  the  development  of
educational  districts.  District  officials,  or  inspectors  in  the   old
terminology, have neither power nor authority. Transformation does not  mean
to jettison the old, but it means blending the old and the new. We  are  not
exaggerating, but inspectors did not know what was happenening  in  some  of
the schools. Some senior secondary  schools  had  become  dysfunctional.  To
help  such  schools  from  sinking  further,  the  power  and  authority  of
inspectors in both the districts and the school  governing  bodies  must  be
strengthened. However, all is not doom and gloom.

Mev M E OLCKERS: Voorsitter, die twee provinsies wat  besoek  is,  is  albei
provinsies wat in 'n groot mate arm en landelik is. Ek wil soos  my  kollega
mnr Moorcroft ook fokus op die plaasskole soos dit in die  verslag  bespreek
is, maar ook in die algemeen.

As ons die oproep van die President ernstig wil opneem, naamlik dat  armoede
met hand en tand beveg moet word, sal plaasskole spesiale aandag  moet  kry.
Onderwys en geletterdheid is die fundamentele hoekstene van  die  bestryding
van armoede deur middel van bemagtiging en menswaardigheid.

Uit persoonlike ondervinding en besoeke weet ek die  meerderheid  plaasskole
het dikwels nie lopende water nie, en baie het  geen  toiletgeriewe  nie  en
geen elektrisiteit nie. Baie van die skole het nie één van  bogenoemde  nie.
Leerders moet baie kilometers stap om by die skool en terug by die  huis  te
kom. Daar is leerders wat tot vier uur per dag moet stap om by die skool  te
kom. Baie keer reën dit en dan kom hulle papnat by die  skool  aan  en  moet
hulle die hele dag in nat klere sit. Dit lei tot  verkoues  en  siektes,  en
maak dit onmoontlik om te konsentreer op die werk.

By baie van die skole het die skoolhoofde nie eens kantore nie  en  is  daar
geen personeelkamer nie. Daar sal weer gekyk moet word na  die  vervoer  vir
leerders of daar sal 'n tipe koshuis by die skole  opgerig  moet  word.  Dit
kan baie basies wees en die kinders kan naweke huistoe gaan. Daar  is  sulke
geriewe by 'n plaasskool in die  Wes-Kaap.  Innoverende  planne  sal  gemaak
moet word om hierdie juwele in die samelewing van ondergang te red.

'n Mens hoor byna nooit van dwelmmisbruik by dié skole nie, en  net  so  min
van bedrog deur die hoof en die onderwysers. In die verslag word talle  kere
gemeld dat van die skole wat besoek is, geen stukkende ruite gehad het  nie.
'n Arm plaasskool het onlangs R600 bestee om hulle ruite te vervang. Dit  is
'n voorbeeld van hoe ons die maatskaplike ingesteldheid van  Suid-Afrikaners
wil hê. Die toegewyde en aardse eerlikheid van die ouers en  onderwysers  in
die platteland is 'n voorbeeld vir almal van ons, veral vir ons  in  hierdie
Huis.

Hier sit ons in luuksheid en ons werk in aangename omstandighede,  maar  wat
is die voorbeeld wat ons as topleiers in die land  stel  aan  hierdie  mense
van wie ek gepraat het? 'n Vorige agb lid - 'n  mens  kan  maar  sê  in  die
huidige verlede, so onlangs is dit  -  het  nie  alleen  'n  onwaarheid  oor
korrupsie in hierdie Huis  verkondig  nie;  hy  het  spesiaal  gevra  om  'n
spreekbeurt in hierdie Huis te kry om die volk te mislei.

'n Ander agb lid is byna nooit in die Parlement nie en ná nege jaar is  daar
nou 'n  ondersoek  gelas  na  haar  optrede.  Toe  sy  gedissiplineer  word,
appelleer sy. Sy sê in die media een van die redes vir haar  afwesigheid  is
dat sy nie kans sien om met sekere kollegas in  een  vertrek  te  wees  nie,
maar dis vir haar aanvaarbaar dat haar salaristjek deur mense van  dieselfde
kleur uitgeskryf word en in 'n bank met meesal  mense  van  dieselfde  kleur
verwerk word.

Watter voorbeeld stel sekere lede  van  hierdie  Huis  aan  die  mense,  die
onderwysers en die leerders van onder meer plaasskole, om na te streef?  Dit
is skandalig dat ons almal wat politici is oor dieselfde kam geskeer word.

Ek vra die Regering om dissiplinêr sterk op te tree teen  politici  wat  vir
ander in dieselfde beroep 'n groot verleentheid veroorsaak, en om hulle  nie
te beskerm nie. Ry 'n slag met julle  Mercedesse  en  julle  4X4's  en  baie
lyfwagte na die plaasskole  van  ons  land  en  gaan  leer  toegewydheid  en
eerlikheid by hulle wat die daaglikse lewe daar leef, baie keer  siek,  moeg
en sonder kos, maar edel en trots op die geleentheid wat hulle gegun word.

Ons in die Nuwe NP salueer  die  mense  van  ons  plaasskole.  Ons  vra  die
Minister om na hulle  te  kyk.  Dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mrs M E OLCKERS: Chairperson, the two provinces that were visited are  both
provinces which are, to a large extent, poor and rural.  Like  my  colleague
Mr Moorcroft, I also want to focus on the farm schools as discussed  in  the
report, but also generally.

If we want to take the President's call seriously, namely that poverty  must
be fought tooth  and  nail,  farm  schools  will  have  to  receive  special
attention. Education  and  literacy  are  the  fundamental  cornerstones  of
combating poverty by way of empowerment and dignity.
From personal experience and visits,  I  know  that  the  majority  of  farm
schools often do not have running water, and many have no toilet  facilities
and no electricity. Many of  the  schools  do  not  even  have  one  of  the
aforementioned. Learners have to walk many kilometres to get to  school  and
back home. There are learners who have to walk up to four  hours  a  day  to
reach school. Often it is raining and they then  arrive  at  school  soaking
wet and have to spend the whole day in wet clothes. This leads to colds  and
illnesses and makes it impossible to concentrate on the work.

At many of the schools the principals do not even have offices and there  is
no staff room. Transport for learners will have to be looked at again  or  a
type of boarding school will have to be built at  the  schools.  It  can  be
very basic and the children can go home on  weekends.  Such  facilities  are
available at a farm school in the Western Cape. Innovative plans  will  have
to be made to save these jewels of society from ruin.

One almost never hears of  drug  abuse  at  these  schools,  and  one  hears
equally little about fraud by the principal and the teachers. In the  report
it is mentioned numerous times that the schools which were  visited  had  no
broken windowpanes. A poor farm school recently spent R600 to replace  their
windowpanes. This is an example of the social  attitude  of  South  Africans
that we would like to have. The dedicated and down-to-earth honesty  of  the
parents  and  teachers  in  the  rural  areas  is  an  example  to  us  all,
particularly us in this House.

Here we sit in luxury and we work under pleasant  conditions,  but  what  is
the example that we as top leaders in the country set for these people I  am
talking about? A former hon member - one could say in the present  past,  it
happened so recently - did not only state an  untruth  about  corruption  in
this House; he specially requested speaking time in this  House  to  mislead
the nation.

Another hon member is virtually never in Parliament and after nine years  an
investigation  into  her  behaviour  has  been  launched.   When   she   was
disciplined, she appealed. She says in the media that  one  of  the  reasons
for her absence is that  she  cannot  be  in  the  same  room  with  certain
colleagues, but it is acceptable to her that her salary  cheque  is  written
out by people of the same colour and processed in a bank with mostly  people
of the same colour.

What example do certain members of  this  House  set  for  the  people,  the
teachers and the learners of farm schools, inter  alia,  to  follow?  It  is
scandalous that all of us who are politicians are  labelled  with  the  same
tag.

I am requesting the Government to take strong  disciplinary  action  against
politicians who cause  others  in  the  same  profession  a  great  deal  of
embarrassment, and not to protect them. Drive out  in  your  Mercedeses  and
your 4X4s and with many bodyguards to the farm schools of  our  country  and
learn dedication and honesty from those who live their  daily  lives  there;
often sick, tired and without food, but noble and proud of  the  opportunity
that they are being given.
We in the New NP salute the people of our farm schools. We ask the  Minister
to take care of them. Thank you.]

Mrs C DUDLEY: Chairman, Minister, hon colleagues, observations made  by  the
multiparty delegations confirm what appears to be the reality in schools  in
many constituencies. The ACDP  concurs  with  recommendations  made  by  the
portfolio committee.

In the now not-so-limited time that I have to address you, I will  endeavour
to highlight some of the issues which we agree are of particular concern.

Firstly,  the  school  nutrition  programme  that  will  soon   become   the
responsibility of  the  Department  of  Education  definitely  needs  urgent
attention, especially in light of its disgraceful  track  record  under  the
management of the Health  department.  Hon  Minister,  it  appears  adequate
planning  will  have  to  include  provision  for  sufficient  monitors  and
inspectors to stop crooked suppliers and  school  officials  from  operating
with impunity.
In Mpumalanga alone, a forensic  audit  revealed  widespread  corruption  by
suppliers, teachers and, in some cases, even parents. One company  supplying
80 schools in a  district  near  White  River  stands  accused  of  charging
massive amounts for food it never delivered, and shame-faced  principals  at
four primary schools in other areas, hard  hit  by  Aids,  unemployment  and
malnutrition, have admitted to investigators  that  they  signed  for  bogus
deliveries.

 The report recommends, with specific reference to  Mpumalanga  again,  that
learner support material, or LSM, OBE  material,  stationery  and  textbooks
get special attention, and that procurement procedures of LSM  be  tightened
up to enhance accountability.

On 18 October 2002 the Middelburg Observer reported on a shocking  discovery
at a recycling company in Middelburg which highlights  these  problems.  Six
tons of Curriculum 2005 OBE textbooks, printed in the year 2000  in  various
languages for Grades 0-9, were discovered still wrapped in  plastic  on  the
recycling floor. Company employees said that tons and tons had already  been
destroyed  and  the  company  produced   documents   from   the   department
authorising disposal of the books. The department's deputy director and  the
investigating officer have confirmed this week  that  arrests  of  officials
linked to the selling of the textbooks should take  place  soon,  thanks  to
the diligence of the concerned citizen and  ACDP  member  who  reported  the
unexpected find.

Within many schools  educators  face  enormous  challenges  with  regard  to
discipline and many express the view  that  corporal  punishment  should  be
reinstated as alternatives prove  ineffective.  While  abuse  of  any  kind,
including discipline, should not be tolerated and must  be  dealt  with,  it
does not help to remove effective measures across the board - just in  case.
Adequate sanitation too is of course critical to the health  of  the  nation
and has to be a priority.

A presentation in February by the Department of Education on plans for 2003-
04 placed school safety  issues,  including  gun-free  zones,  the  cost  of
education and a comprehensive  response  to  HIV/Aids  on  the  agenda,  and
referred to the implementation of the Revised  Curriculum  Statement  as  an
ongoing mandate.

As training of  teachers  on  values  reflected  in  the  curriculum,  moral
renewal and the fight against racism  will  be  priorities  for  Government,
public participation will be necessary  to  allay  concerns  as  the  values
propounded in the curriculum have previously been  a  point  of  contention,
and Government's interpretation of morality has  also  been  questioned.  In
line with the recommendations, which call for greater emphasis  on  HIV/Aids
awareness, the ACDP is calling for funds to be made  available  for  schools
to access  material  based  on  proven  moral  values  which  build  healthy
individuals  and  families  instead  of  the  liberal  and  licentious   sex
education presently imposed on provinces.

Finally, the ACDP agrees  that  improved  communication  between  the  MEC's
office and district  offices,  as  well  as  between  district  offices  and
schools, is essential. Thank you.
Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA: Chairperson, hon members, the  Constitution  guarantees
that all South Africans have the right to basic education,  including  adult
education.  Our  immediate  strategic  objective  is  to  create  a   united
nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa.

Coming as we do from an apartheid era that  had  an  education  system  that
sought to erode the reproduction of a black intelligentsia and whose  policy
of Bantu education was  aimed  at  destroying  institutions  which  produced
African intellectuals and professionals, and replacing them  with  forms  of
learning that stifled critical thinking, creativity and innovation, we  grew
up  knowing  that  government  was  a  big  untouchable  dinosaur  based  in
Pretoria. Now that is no more.

However, the pedagogical efficiency of our system  in  terms  of  curriculum
delivery and learner  achievement  still  needs  to  be  strengthened.  Many
children, mostly in rural areas, do not know where  to  go  after  finishing
their matric in terms of whether they  should  take  up  temporary  work  or
continue with their studies. Some learners  face  the  challenge  of  poorly
resourced environments at school and at home.

I wish to quote from a statement made by the hon Minister  of  Education  at
the GSIS parliamentary media briefing on 15 August  2002.  He  said,  and  I
quote:


  Education sits at the top among those critical instruments to achieve the
  goal of releasing our people from the jaws of poverty.

The Portfolio  Committee  on  Education  undertook  a  provincial  visit  to
Mpumalanga and the Free State which was aimed at  focusing  on  adult  basic
education, early childhood  development,  programmes  on  HIV/Aids,  primary
nutrition, scholar transport, etc. There was a common outcry in  almost  all
the schools we  visited  regarding  issues  such  as  late  distribution  of
stationery and learner support material; overcrowding  which  leads  to  the
shortage of classrooms; there is a  pilot  project  on  inclusive  education
that is moving slowly because schools are not user-friendly to learners  who
are in wheelchairs and, regarding deaf learners, a  programme  for  bringing
in teachers for sign language is moving slowly.

We also visited a dysfunctional school, ie Masizakhe High School, where  the
principal was unable to introduce his  school  management  team  as  he  was
unfamiliar with who they were. There was in-fighting among the  staff  where
individual interest was pursued at the expense of children's education.  The
matric pass rate was very low, with no prospects for improvement.

We visited the school in January, and learning did not  take  place  on  the
first day of school. There was chaos, and  the  Grades  8  and  11  students
received their results on the opening day of school.

I wish to congratulate the department of education in Mpumalanga  on  taking
disciplinary action against those teachers who  were  responsible  for  that
situation. The principal was suspended, and five teachers were charged  with
misconduct and one was acquitted.

The President, in his state of the  nation  address,  and  the  Minister  of
Finance, emphasised the fact that those public servants who are not  willing
to serve the nation mabahambe [must leave].

Two senior officials have  been  deployed  to  the  school  in  question  to
normalise the situation, and a mentor principal has also  been  deployed  to
the school.

These visits created  a  very  good  working  relationship  between  members
deployed in the different constituencies and the  Department  of  Education.
In January we held  a  joint  programme  in  which  we  worked  together  in
visiting  schools.  I  can  confidently  say  we  had  service  delivery  in
Mpumalanga. Jointly, we prioritised the building of  additional  classes  in
those schools which are overcrowded. In Mpumalanga there's still  a  backlog
of 4 000 classrooms that need to be built.

Four months after the visit of the committee, the office of the MEC  sent  a
response to the report we had submitted to them. The  response  covered  all
the areas which needed attention in order  to  be  attended  to.  This  year
there was early distribution of stationery and learner support material,  as
opposed to the late distribution during our visit.

In conclusion, an assessment of South Africa today indicates that the  lives
of our people are, by and large, gradually changing for the  better.  Access
to basic services has  been  extended  to  millions  of  our  people.  This,
indeed, shows that the ANC, through education, can push back  the  frontiers
of poverty. Real quality learning can be achieved by  staffing  dynamic  and
vibrant  schools  with  dedicated  teachers  who  understand  the  moral  of
teaching.

We must create a cadre of teachers who are key agents in social projects  of
education.

[I don't know, hon Dudley, whether you are all  that  hard-headed.  I  heard
you saying ... I don't know if someone is interpreting for you. Anyway,  you
will have to talk to your parents because  they  are  responsible  for  your
missing  the  opportunity  of  learning  the  other  languages  during   the
apartheid regime. You know, it was said  that  apartheid  suppressed  blacks
only, and yet it suppressed all of us because here you are  today,  and  you
also did not have the privilege of learning other languages!

Hon member, you are now asking the Department  of  Education  when  it  will
start with the school feeding scheme campaign, yet you  sit  here  with  the
committee and you know very well that the campaign  will  only  be  starting
next year. But you now come here and pretend that you are new and  innocent!
[Interjections.]

I want to clearly state that I believe you have heard that in this  campaign
we are moving and are at work. Nevertheless, there will be some  people  who
will see only where nothing has been done. Thank you, ladies and  gentlemen,
the sons and daughters of the mighty Lion of Lobamba, King Sobhuza  II,  you
who  ran  around  the  Lebombo  Mountains  to  their  end.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI:  Chairperson and hon members, in its quest to  improve  the
quality of life of the people out in the country,  Parliament  continues  to
send committees to gain first-hand  information.  Visits  by  the  Portfolio
Committee on Education to Mpumalanga and the  Free  State  have  brought  to
light that issues raised by Naptosa research have  substance,  despite  what
the Minister said in his response to the statement I made last week.

Recommendations on both  visits  indicate  that  communication  between  the
MECs'  offices,  departmental  officials,  schools  and  other  stakeholders
needs, I  quote,  ``drastic  improvement''.  Indications  are  that  primary
schools have taken in-service training courses in OBE to  heart,  while  the
same cannot be said of  post-primary  schools.  This  has  to  be  addressed
urgently.

The recent decision to discontinue the OBE methodology at high school  until
2006 indicates the  state  of  unpreparedness  of  the  department.  Delayed
deliveries of learner support materials experienced during the visit  impact
negatively on the provision of education. Let us call on all those  involved
to take their responsibilities seriously. Educators and parents continue  to
do admirable work under trying circumstances of unemployment, and having  to
cope with the new demands of being on top of the  situation  as  members  of
school governing bodies.

It is a long learning curve that calls for forbearance from all of  us.  The
UCDP notes with appreciation the elaborate efforts made by  the  Free  State
department  of  education  around  promoting  the  awareness   of   HIV/Aids
education programmes. Surely the tide is turning for the good.

The positive contribution made by farmers in the Free State  towards  making
schooling accessible on their farms needs to be  commended.  We  hope  other
farmers elsewhere in the country will take a leaf  from  their  book.  [Time
expired.]
Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, our first  word  is  of  appreciation  for  this
intensive visit by the committee to  Mpumalanga  and  the  Free  State.  The
oversight function of Parliament was well  attempted,  and  it  should  make
people in our provinces and in the far-flung areas  and  schools  feel  that
they are not forgotten people. The overall  picture  that  emerges  is  that
there is some improvement in some schools.  But  there  are  still  problems
showing that we inherited a situation from the past  regime  that  was  most
inhuman and intolerable.

The progress of a government and this Parliament will  be  measured  in  the
way we bring equity to our schools and communities. We  must  work  hard  to
bring freedom and immense transformation in our schools.  A  school  in  the
new South Africa must  be  understood  in  the  same  way  for  all  people,
otherwise nonracialism has  no  meaning  whatsoever.  Some  schools  in  our
country are so shocking that one wonders how education can be given in  such
an environment.

Last week I visited a school  in  Bolobedu  in  Tzaneen  on  the  border  of
Limpopo  and  Mpumalanga.  The  windows  were  broken,  the  inside  of  the
classroom was horrible, and the toilets were  not  toilets  at  all.  It  is
difficult to imagine how particularly girls and lady teachers survive a  day
in such a school. This community has also asked me  to  bring  a  Macedonian
call to this Parliament, a loud appeal for help and assistance.

The task for the Government is to relook at the question  of  priorities  in
spending. This is a matter of great urgency.  We  must  bury  the  apartheid
legacy, particularly in the place  where  freedom  should  begin  -  in  the
classrooms. We must appeal to parents and the business sector  to  help.  We
also register appreciation for the efforts of former  President  Mandela  in
motivating the business community to assist in school construction.

A generation of properly educated pupils  will  become  our  allies  in  the
struggle for a new democratic, nonracial,  nonsexist  South  Africa  in  the
culture and spirit of our human rights ideals. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson  and  hon  Minister.  The  MF  found
that, while pleased at some reports of the delegation on the matter  set  as
the subject, there were many reports of  sad  apartheid-era  scenarios  that
were upsetting and disappointing; upsetting in that such  conditions  are  a
reality and disappointing in that they exist.

However, it's reports of such harsh truths that push us  forward  to  change
the learning conditions that some of these schools  are  forced  to  operate
in. The MF applauds the increase in the budget for the LSM,  stationery  and
textbooks,  and  is  pleased  with  the  Mpumalanga  MEC  for  his  constant
supervision over the process.

There  are  achievements  in  infrastructure  in  Mpumalanga.  However,  the
backlog is a worry and efforts need  to  be  made  to  meet  it,  especially
noting its effect on the learning process. Though major improvement  appears
to have been reached in light of scholars' transport,  many  learners  still
have to be catered for.

There are many teachers looking for jobs, with  appropriate  qualifications,
from more developed areas and towns.  The  MF  feels  that  this  supply  of
teachers should be taken to such areas as  Mpumalanga,  where  services  are
needed. The situation of farm schools is stressing, which brings us  to  the
situation in the Free State. Transport is a major  issue  and  needs  to  be
addressed.

The MF does not think we  should  establish  hostels.  These  children  need
their families as much as they need the education.  Transport  needs  to  be
accommodated. From the report, efforts to assist the  Free  State  situation
appear to be under way.

The recommendations made for both areas are supported  by  the  MF,  and  we
hope that the  same  may  be  done  in  the  KwaZulu-Natal  area  and  other
provinces. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, it was a privilege for me to be  part  of  the
group visiting schools in the Free State. For a week I had a  very  pleasant
minibus-taxi experience with other members.

I must mention I was proud of the  contribution  made  by  farmers.  It  was
already mentioned, ie the  transport  infrastructure,  and  people  who  are
really taking this country forward.

We experienced some problems with everything  not  being  in  place  in  the
departments, such as correspondence that is long overdue, etc. I  think  the
words of both the President and the  Minister  of  Finance,  in  his  Budget
Speech,  should  be  remembered  here.  Improvement  in  infrastructure  and
facilities is very important. It  can't  be  overemphasised,  but  something
must be mentioned.

We experienced this strange phenomenon. We visited  a  well-equipped  school
which was dysfunctional. We also visited  a  small  school  with  far  fewer
facilities, but  it  is  performing  very  well.  Let  us  always  remember:
important as it may be, the core of education is not bricks, but people.  We
must remember that.

Throughout our visit, we  received  some  concerns  about  Curriculum  2005.
Teachers are not geared for it at the moment.  We  must  think  again  about
this issue.

Another thing I want to mention  is  that  we  experienced  real  leadership
amongst  some  younger  teachers  who  have  aspirations,  while  the  older
headmaster is only serving his sentence. We must look at this  so  that  not
only seniority but also merit will be the cornerstone of a promotion in  our
education system.

Lastly, I want to thank the hon Moses Kgwele, who  was  the  leader  of  our
group, for a very pleasant experience and the leadership  that  he  extended
to us during this week. Thank you.

Mr B M KOMPHELA: Thank you, Chairperson. We attended  a  conference  of  the
Labour Relations Council in Port Elizabeth. At that conference,  the  Deputy
Director-General of  the  Eastern  Cape  was  throwing  around  his  weight,
saying: "Kuyahanjwa e-Eastern Cape" [The Eastern  Cape  is  progressing].  I
would like to invite him to come and see that Freistata re  a  tsamaya  [the
Free State is progressing]. Akuhanjwa, re a tsamaya in the  Free  State.  Re
ya ntshetsopeleng. [We are developing.]

It is true that in 1994 the  majority  of  our  people  chose  the  national
liberation movement led by the ANC as the political force that  should  lead
our country and we are now going through the post-apartheid process for  the
reconstruction and development of the people as a whole.

One of the critical challenges faced  by  our  movement,  the  ANC,  is  the
struggle to push back the frontiers of poverty experienced  by  our  people.
It took us 80 years to be free, so we do not care how much it  is  going  to
take or what it is going to cost us to get there, but  definitely,  we  will
redeem our people from the shackles of poverty.

The visit by the portfolio committee was very important  and  long  overdue.
It has given us an opportunity to be on the  ground  with  people.  We  must
have first-hand information and experience of what  is  taking  place.  Last
year, when I was at this podium, I said that the nation was at work.

It is true that the nation is at work and  our  people  are  at  work.  Last
year's results are a testimony to the fact that, really, the  nation  is  at
work. We have seen what our country has achieved as far as the  results  are
concerned. That is the testimony that the nation is  at  work.  We  are  not
naive to think that there are no challenges. Sixty per cent of  the  schools
in the Free State are farm schools. One can imagine the kind of poverty  and
the struggle of those pupils to  attain  quality  and  a  better  education.
Under these circumstances, the  ANC-led  Government  is  trying  to  make  a
better life. We have not finally applied our  strategy  to  attract  quality
and better teachers in farm  schools  because  every  person  wants  to  see
himself in an urban place.

In one of the comments that we made we said that it would be  important  for
us, together with the Minister, to check  what  incentives  we  can  put  in
place to attract quality teachers to give our children what is important  as
far as education is concerned.

Today we can tell this country and the world that the ANC-led Government  in
the Free State has made sure that learners in the Free  State  are  able  to
get a better education and they must go out on the strain of a long walk  to
a better education. Last year the Free State department told us that in  the
five districts which the Free State is composed  of,  they  will  definitely
have hostels for those children. I am here to report as  a  person  who  was
part of that committee. Out of the five districts, three  districts  already
have these. The Xhariep district has what is called Ollen School  where  all
the farm children in that  region  are  housed  and  fed  in  that  boarding
school. Go and check the kind of commitment they have there.

In the Thabo-Mofutshanyane district, which is in Qwaqwa,  the  school  there
in Tseki is a boarding school.  The  Free  State  MEC  and  the  Free  State
government have made sure that children in  that  densely  populated  Qwaqwa
area are able to not walk and risk their lives in the cold and at night  and
at any other time.  Children  are  housed  there.  Go  and  see  those  farm
children. They have a commitment in ensuring that in no  time  the  children
will attain a better education.

In Mothew district, which is in the Bloemfontein area,  at  the  old  Moroka
High School, the same applies. It is true  that  if  children  do  not  have
food, if they have to walk a long distance, and  if  they  are  tired,  they
cannot cope with the type of education that they are given.  Those  boarding
schools that they have created there bear testimony. Anybody  who  wants  to
check the achievements of  those  children  two  years  ago,  compared  with
today's achievements will see that it is true  that  hunger  makes  children
not perform at the maximum that they are capable of.

We also appreciate the contribution  of  bicycles  by  very  generous  South
Africans who have given the Free State almost 400 bicycles. Those  learners,
those boys and girls who are using those bicycles, today are able  to  reach
the school untired and to go home  safely.  They  are  also  enjoying  those
bicycles. We say thank you for those little contributions. They changed  the
lives of the Free State children greatly.

I would like to say to this House today on the issue of textbooks, which  is
one of the most  problematic  areas  in  the  Free  State,  that  they  were
delivered in December. I can bear testimony to that because we were part  of
the ANC to make sure that in January,  whether  schools  start  on  time  or
whatever else is happening there, all schools in the Free  State  had  books
and schools started on time. That is an achievement. If  one  starts  right,
one will finish right. The pass rate has increased, yes.

Regarding the nutrition programme in the Free State,  people  are  beginning
to benefit from that. In the three boarding schools that I  have  mentioned,
plus other schools that are there, 29 000 farm children are benefiting  from
the nutrition programme. Minister, it is not enough, but at  least  we  have
moved a step forward in addressing  the  poverty  facing  our  children.  We
thank you for that.

There are practical problems around the nutrition  programme.  The  criteria
that are used need to be reviewed because even in the case of those  schools
that have better walls, there are children  who  come  from  the  Joe  Slovo
squatter camp and other squatter camps  who  have  come  to  school  without
having had any food at home. When one puts a criterion that  if  the  bricks
that the school is built with are good then one can  assume  that  even  the
children in those buildings come from families that are  probably  as  well-
off as the school, I think we need to revisit and check that so that  we  do
not put that down as a criterion. I know it is not a criterion but  I  think
we need  to  check  it  seriously  because  very  hungry  and  improverished
learners are in those beautiful schools.

Again I would like to thank you hon members because all farmers in the  Free
State, the majority of them, up to 90% of them, have signed  contracts  with
the MEC for education and they have volunteered. Others came and  said:  "We
want to sign contracts so that our children in school on farms are  able  to
get a better education." We commend them for that.

We salute cadres and patriots of  this  movement  who  have  helped  in  the
spirit of volunteerism and also in the  schools,  and  in  the  delivery  of
textbooks. They have even volunteered to help in the  feeding  schemes  that
are taking place in the schools, and even in boarding schools so that  those
children can have a better life. Many have made an input to help change  the
lives of our people for the better.  This  has  given  an  indication  that,
indeed, many of our people, black and white, are prepared to extend  a  hand
to make a better life for everybody.

I would like to say that a certain Mr Hendrik De Jager has donated land  for
this school, free of charge. He said he wanted children to get this. We  are
saying to Mr De Jager: Thank you very much. Mr De Jager passed away and  his
wife is still there. She has  a  very  powerful  infrastructure  there.  The
school is going down because the husband has passed away. That was a  school
that was given free for everybody to use with a boarding  school  ...  [Time
expired.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, ladies  and  gentlemen  -  I  beg
your pardon - members of the National Assembly, I welcome  this  opportunity
to be part of this debate, although I understand that it is not  always  the
case that the Minister concerned is asked to participate in such instances.

The issues, concerns and challenges raised in the report  are  not  only  of
importance to the two provinces visited, but to all of our schools in  South
Africa, for all our provinces, and for the quality of education. Of  course,
I cannot help but notice the enthusiasm with which the committee went  about
its work, particularly in the Free  State,  having  exceeded  even  its  own
objectives. Therefore, the response to this kind  of  eye-opening  exercises
cannot be defensive on anyone's part, because this is not  only  identifying
the areas where things are happening very well, but also the pathologies  of
what is taking place.

Democracy is a very  wonderful  thing.  This  afternoon,  whilst  coming  to
Parliament, I was pleasantly accosted by four  Grade  11  girls.  They  said
that in a school not a thousand miles away from here  they  had  no  teacher
for physical science; they had not received any  textbooks,  and  they  come
from a very poor background, and had to buy them. So you see, the  flesh  is
willing, but the mind does not  work  in  this  case.  Systems  break  down,
particularly in the Western Cape. These are section 21 schools that  control
their entire budget, unlike the schools that the committee went  to.  So,  I
think one of the good things about democracy is that  the  Minister  can  be
stopped in the middle  of  the  street  and  told  this,  knowing  that  the
Minister will follow it up immediately. That is the important thing, then.

So, you looked not only at the various education  programmes,  but  you  set
out to investigate and completed  the  infrastructure  inspections  of  each
school you visited, looked at such issues as management and  the  supply  of
learning  support  materials.  Unfortunately,  you  did  not  look  at   the
development plans since  each  school  in  South  Africa,  under  the  South
African Schools Act, has to have a development plan.  I  think  it  is  very
important to capture what they are doing.

The Mpumalanga section of the report goes into quite specific  detail  on  a
variety of infrastructural and other issues. I  am  grateful,  though,  that
the Free State section of the report keeps, in detailed terms, to its  terms
of reference. Unfortunately, some of the Mpumalanga report relies  too  much
on the outpouring of individual principals,  some  of  whom  tend  to  blame
everyone except themselves. I regularly find  this  when  I  visit  schools.
Invariably, it is the pupils and the parents who  are  blamed,  and  I  will
come to this in a moment.

Also let me say that the report overwhelmingly confirms our  own  assessment
of the state of schooling in South Africa, and particularly the findings  of
our School Register of Needs, which I commend to members of Parliament,  and
there should be a copy in the library. This serves as a  guideline  for  the
targeting of resources and funding as well as the  just-released  review  of
the funding, financing, resourcing and cost of education in public schools.

These two documents, together with the various  reports  -  there  have  now
been seven since 1999 - to the President of the  country  on  the  provinces
provide a very realistic and  accurate  picture  of  the  challenges  facing
education. So, I am very pleased the portfolio committee has been  out  into
the field to see for itself what is happening, although I am sorry  that  no
officials from my own national department accompanied the committee  on  its
visits to  help  facilitate  follow-up  work  that  is  needed,  whereas  on
previous visits, officials had accompanied them. I am  sorry  they  are  not
here to listen to the  quality  of  the  interventions  and  particularly  a
debate of this kind where members recognise - I  am  pleased  that  so  many
members are here - that there are certain issues in our  body  politic  that
transcend political differences, and that we are part of the instruments  of
change. So, we can have our politically-heightened differences, but  we  are
part of the instruments of change, and education seems  to  bring  out  -  I
must say - the best in my colleagues in Cabinet and, I am  pleased  to  say,
in this House too.

I am encouraged by many of the  positive  aspects  of  provincial  education
highlighted in the report, although, as is usually the case, it is  not  the
good news we concentrate on, but the difficulties and  challenges  presented
by systems that aren't working correctly or resources that are inadequate.

Clearly, I cannot deal with  the  problems  identified  in  each  individual
school. That has to be done by the provincial education departments,  and  I
presume the report  has  already  been  sent  to  the  provincial  portfolio
committees, MECs and heads of departments responsible for education. I  will
ensure that the provinces provide me with a school-by-school report  on  the
matters identified by the committee, as well as the general  recommendations
the committee makes, since we need to be mindful of the  needs  in  all  our
schools, not just those signalled out for high-profile visits.

Let me deal with some  general  observations  very  quickly.  In  the  first
instance, many of  the  issues  raised  deal  specifically  with  resources,
whether they are in the form  of  teacher  and  staff  components,  learning
materials  and  infrastructure.  The  review  of  the  financing,  cost  and
resourcing of education, which I released this  week,  shows  without  doubt
that there have been improvements in  our  procurement,  financial  planning
and management systems.

But, many challenges  remain.  We  know,  for  example,  our  infrastructure
backlog could be as high as R30  billion,  but  we  also  know  that  it  is
decreasing annually. The Minister of Finance gave  all  the  provinces  R1,3
billion for infrastructure development. This is a  remarkable  part  of  the
fruits of our macroeconomic policy - for the next three  years,  there  will
be R103 billion available for infrastructure. There  is  no  doubt  we  will
push very hard for education there.

So, I commissioned this report because I was concerned about the  conditions
of the degradation of our schools, backlogs in development and  maintenance,
and inadequate allocation of teachers and material. I said this afternoon  I
hope for an opportunity, even  with  the  one-man  party,  to  discuss  this
report, because it is the best thing we have produced.

We now have a very good picture of the resourcing situation, and  some  very
useful recommendations were made by my officials on how to handle  this.  We
have quadrupled - a 400% increase - the amount spent on  textbooks  and  the
learning support materials in the last three-and-a-half  years.  We  ensure,
in the main, that this material is delivered to  schools  on  time  for  the
beginning of the school year, but as I say, there  are  27  000  schools  in
South Africa and it is a very important report that  should  be  looked  at,
but we cannot supply learning materials to every grade. No  country  in  the
world does that. In fact, we are the only country in Africa, I  think,  that
supplies the learning materials to  schools.  Therefore,  the  retrieval  of
books, which is one of the things that we have to  look  at,  is  enormously
important. In former ex-model C schools - when I went around - up to 90%  of
the books  were  retrieved.  In  townships,  rurals  areas,  it  was  hardly
anything. It has changed in the last two or  three  years.  The  poorest  of
schools are bringing back 60% or 70% of the materials that were sent out.

The next point I want to make is a  very  important  recommendation,  and  I
have said this publicly: The failure of district officials  is  one  of  the
most devastating things here. I regret to say that  many  of  them  are  old
homeland officials who were  appointed  in  apartheid  times  and  have  not
caught the spirit of the age - that they are servants of the public.  It  is
neither the committee nor I who should bring what is wrong to the  attention
of the MECs. We are not Father Christmases. We will make  visits  every  two
or three years. It is their job - the district officials' job - to keep  the
head of the department and the MEC informed about what  is  wrong  in  every
school. If they do not visit every school once a month, they are in  default
of their contract of employment.

We are now sayng, because I accept personal responsibility,  that  the  MECs
must ensure that the district officials perform their work. If they do  not,
then the MEC is responsible for nonfulfilment of the  officials'  functions.
There is no other way. You see, we must go  away  from  the  old  idea  that
Ministers and portfolio committees are able to supply the  goodies,  because
the goodies can only go to the schools we visit. What  about  the  adjoining
school? What about the school over the hill that we have not  visited?  That
is why the  district  officials  must  be  tied  to  their  obligations.  We
reiterate this: It is vital for the performance  -  in  my  view  -  of  the
educational system that the middle management or lower  management  are  the
ones who must, of course, be encouraged by the leadership.

School management and governance is very important, and that is  why  I  set
up a committee on the functioning of school governing bodies,  because  they
are central to the democratic participation  of  our  people,  and  I  hope,
members of Parliament, however anecdotal your views may be, they  are  based
on your own personal experiences. I hope you will write  to  the  committee,
or write care of me about your own experiences as to how we can improve  the
performance of school governing bodies. Particularly, it might be better  to
group some of the school governing bodies on a local district level so  that
they can be more efficiently run.

What is immediately clear is that there will never be good management  in  a
school unless there is parental participation. There are 27 000  schools  in
South Africa. No official can look after 27 000 schools - we  must  remember
that. Schools that function well, as the report says quite clearly, are  the
schools where the  parents  are  actively  involved.  That  is  particularly
important because before 1994, volunteerism or  Letsema,  was  a  subversive
notion. If you were a volunteer, you would then say  ``My  God,  this  is  a
system that we must change''. That is why the notion of  voluntary  activity
has been dimmed among many of our people, and I regret to say that  this  is
across all racial groups, by the way, because I have found that out when  it
comes to school governing bodies. That is why  it  is  enormously  important
that the leadership should come from us. A school is  secure  where  parents
are involved. Where the parents aren't  involved,  you  find,  as  the  Free
State report says, that in  a  highly  well-equipped  school,  the  teachers
aren't performing their functions. It is a shame;  an  appalling  thing.  In
the same way, where school governing bodies  are  involved,  there  will  be
pressure on the provinces to provide the minimum of resources.

I don't have the time to go into the issue of farm schools, because I  think
we should have a debate on farm schools in this House. It is an  inheritance
that  creates  enormous  problems.  I  don't  think  boarding  schools,  hon
Moorcroft, are necessarily the answer. They  are  very  expensive.  We  find
already from the report that there are thousands of Free State children  who
do not live at home. They live in shacks; they live in backyards.  There  is
a breakdown of family life. We must help in that. Obviously, in some  areas,
boarding schools are the right things to do. There is no doubt  about  that.
It is a matter of general application, and  is  phenomenally  expensive.  We
have to realise that. That is why the grouping of schools may be  the  right
way, providing transport is provided.

Many countries in the world have closed  down  one-teacher  schools.  It  is
nearly effectively impossible to run a school of five  or  six  grades  with
one teacher. I went to school where  there  were  two  teachers  for  up  to
standard six, so I know what happens  when  you  have  two  teachers  up  to
standard six, as I know from my own evidence. That is why it may  be  better
to group schools together. In a word, therefore, Free State  leads  the  way
in the contracts between farm schools and the MECs. I like the way  the  hon
Aucamp, obviously in the  Afrikaans  language,  said:  ``The  Minister  will
invite some of the  farmers'',  and  not  that  ``We  respectfully  ask  the
Minister to invite them''! [Laughter.]
I would like to say that I must follow what the Free State  report  says.  I
can't disappoint the hon Aucamp. I will invite some of those farmers to  the
Budget Vote here, and give special attention to them. [Applause.]

The curriculum issues are very important. I thank the  Minister  for  saying
that the difficulties arise - that is why I am  sorry  my  officials  aren't
here - when you have classrooms, and the teachers have to deal with  two  or
three classes without progress in education. This is something  we  have  to
give special training in for teachers who deal with multiple classes.

May I say also that the report  refers  to  the  matriculation  results  for
2001. I am going to look through it, school by school, to see what  happened
in the two reports.  There  are  significant  changes  and  improvements  in
Mpumalanga from 46,9% in 2001 to 55,8%. In the Free State, there was a  pass
rate of 70,7% and the improvement of 11 percentage points in one year -  the
best improvement amongst all the provinces.
There is in fact a generalised improvement  in  the  academic  performances,
but of course, notwithstanding the great  number  of  physical  difficulties
they have.

I am very pleased this debate was held. I think it is important to focus  on
some of these areas school by school. As  public  representatives,  we  must
ensure that we encourage good  practice,  and  that  we  play  our  role  in
ensuring that schools and teachers  are  given  the  support  they  need  to
provide the quality of education we  wish  for  all  our  children,  and  to
overcome the legacy of the past.

Therefore, I greet the House for receiving this report, and for  encouraging
this debate. As far as the hon Dudley is  concerned,  I  will  talk  to  her
later, but I want to tell her that there is nothing licentitious  about  sex
education.

I don't want to strike a discordant note. I must say  thank  you  very  much
for the way in which  you  worked  together  to  provide  remedies  for  our
educational system. Thank you, hon members. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I  move  that  the
report be adopted.

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 18:49.
