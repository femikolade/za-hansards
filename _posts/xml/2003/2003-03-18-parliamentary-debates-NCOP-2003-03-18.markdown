                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Deputy Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I will move  at
the next sitting of the Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -
       (a)  that the  civil  war  in  the  Sudan,  which  started  in  1955,
           continues and that some 2 million Sudanese have  been  butchered
           by the Northern Sudanese forces over this period;


       (b)  the hope held out by the Machakos Protocol of July 2002, entered
           into between the government of the Sudan and the Sudan  Peoples'
           Liberation Movement/Sudan People's Liberation Army;


       (c)  that after a halting start and many violations, the  process  is
           still on track; and


       (d)  that the churches and their international partners  are  holding
           the annual Assembly of  the  Sudan  Ecumenical  Forum  in  South
           Africa from 23  to  27  February,  shortly  before  Sudan  peace
           negotiations begin in Nairobi. They will  discuss,  inter  alia,
           breaches of the cease-fire by the government of the  Sudan  that
           have come to light; and


  (2) calls upon the Government of South Africa to  encourage  the  parties
       concerned to stay within the agreement and the spirit of the Machakos
       Protocol and to steadfastly endeavour to bring  peace,  order  and  a
       newly agreed upon constitutional order to the Sudan which responds to
       their needs, including those of the majority of  the  people  in  the
       South  of  Sudan  to  the  right  of  self-determination,  tested  by
       referendum in future.

Mr T S SETONA: Deputy Chairperson, I shall move at the next sitting  of  the
Council:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the resurgence of interest  by  the  Democratic  Party  in  the
         National Youth Commission;


  (2) further notes that they have consistently attacked  this  institution
         and called for its dissolution;


  (3) believes their attacks are timed to coincide with the next  elections
         as a ploy to demobilise and demoralise the youth  of  this  country
         from making a meaningful contribution in  the  nation-building  and
         reconstruction of this country.
  (4) is of the opinion that in attacking the Youth Commission  the  DP  is
         resorting to  old  military  propagandist  tactics  reminiscent  of
         their leader during the heydays of apartheid of selective truth  to
         justify their positions;


  (5) is further of the  opinion  that  the  attack  of  DP  on  the  Youth
         Commission is at worst an attack on the youth of this  country  and
         at least a celebration of legacy of the  unbearable  socio-economic
         conditions of the youth of this country of which  the  DP  and  its
         predecessors were architects; and


  (6) calls for a debate on the state of  the  youth  in  South  Africa  to
         expose the baseless  and  unpatriotic  record  of  the  DP  in  the
         history of this country in terms of youth aspirations. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek  gee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad namens die Nuwe NP sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem van die Nuwe NP se standpunt oor  die  naderende
  en klaarblyklik onafwendbare oorlog in Irak, naamlik dat -


  (1) Irak moet voldoen aan alle VN-vereistes oor ontwapening,  insluitende
       dié van resolusie 1441;


  (2)  indien  Irak  nie  aan  die  VN-vereistes  voldoen  nie,   die   VN-
       veiligheidsraad en nie die VSA op sy  eie  nie,  strafmaatreëls  teen
       Irak moet instel, wat selfs militêre optrede  kan  insluit  ingevolge
       artikel 43 van die VN-handves;


  (3) indien strafmaatreëls wel ingestel word,  Suid-Afrika  ten  alle  tye
       neutraal moet staan aangesien dit nie in Suid-Afrika en sy  mense  se
       belang sal wees om kant te kies vir Irak nie; en


  (4) dit tyd geword het dat Suid-Afrika sê waar hy staan.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the Council notes the New NP's position regarding the impending  and
  clearly inevitable war in Iraq, namely that -


  (1) Iraq has to comply with all  UN  regulations  regarding  disarmament,
       including that of Resolution 1441;


  (2) if Iraq does not comply with the  UN  regulations,  the  UN  Security
       Council and not the USA on its own, must introduce sanctions  against
       Iraq that could even include military actions in terms of section  43
       of the UN Charter;


  (3) if sanctions are introduced South Africa should at all  times  remain
       neutral as it will not be in the best interest of  South  Africa  and
       its people to take the side of Iraq; and


  (4) the time has come for South Africa to say where it stands.]

Dr E A CONROY: Adjunkvoorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met diepe rou kennis neem van vyf van ons kinders se lewens wat in 'n
       oogwink kortgeknip is toe hulle in die afgelope weke in die  omgewing
       van hul ouerhuise in afsonderlike insidente deur die dwaalkoeëls  van
       strydende bendes neergevel is;


  (2) saam met die  ouers,  familie  en  vriende  van  Tyrone  Smith,  Lulu
       Appollis, Desmoné Smith, Onelda Bosman en Romano Amsterdam treur  oor
       hul tragiese heengaan; en


  (3) dade en optredes deur onverantwoordelike individue en groeperings wat
       tot sinnelose verlies van onskuldige  lewens  lei,  in  die  sterkste
       terme veroordeel.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY:  Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) mournfully notes that five of our children  lost  their  lives  in  a
       fraction of a second, during the past few weeks, in the area of their
       parental homes when they were struck down in  separate  incidents  by
       stray bullets from warring gangs;


  (2) together with the parents, families and friends of Tyrone Smith, Lulu
       Appollis, Desmoné Smith, Onelda Bosman, and Romano Amsterdam, grieves
       over their tragic deaths; and


  (3) condemns, in the strongest terms, deeds  and  acts  by  irresponsible
       individuals and groupings leading to the senseless loss  of  innocent
       lives.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:
   That the Council -


   (1)      notes with sadness the passing away of  Linda  Thokozile  Mbeki-
         Jiba, the sister of our President, at the age of 61; and


   (2)      extends its sincere  condolences  to  President  Mbeki  and  the

                         PASSING OF MR ABDUL DOCRAT

                             (Draft resolution)

Ms J L KGOALI: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes -


  (1) the death of 87-year-old Mr  Abdul  Docrat,  widely  known  by  local
       political activists in Durban as "Old Man Doc",  and  that  "Old  Man
       Doc", from Victoria Street in Durban, was active in the Natal  Indian
       Congress and the South African Communist Party since the 1940s;


  (2) that after his release from prison in 1978, he was  served  with  the
       most vicious house arrest  conditions  preventing  contact  with  the
       public for 22 hours on a weekday and for 24 hours over the weekends;


  (3) that Mr Abdul Docrat was under house arrest until  the  unbanning  of
       political organisations in 1990;


  (4) that those that knew "Old Man Doc" would testify he was  always  kept
       abreast of political developments despite his physical restriction;


  (5) that his little flat in Central Durban was  a  venue  to  access  the
       latest political journals providing scarce sources of information for
       many a political strategist;


  (6) that the ANC laments the loss of this stalwart of  the  struggle  and
       believes that his life and contribution serves as a benchmark for all
       of us;


  (7) that the ANC occupies the current political landscape as  the  result
       of  the  tremendous  courage,  discipline  and   indomitable   spirit
       displayed by cadres such as "Old Man Doc"; and


  (8) that the ANC therefore salutes him and remains committed to the tasks
       to which he steadfastly dedicated his life.


       Aluta continua "Old Man Doc".

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  HUMAN RIGHTS DAY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Deputy Chairperson, I'm sure this motion  was  not  moved
last week. [Laughter.] I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  on 21 March 1960, 69 African people were  brutally  murdered  in
           the township of Sharpeville when police  fired  on  unarmed  and
           peaceful demonstrators;


       (b)  the action of the police in the apartheid  regime  violated  the
           right to life, freedom of  assembly,  freedom  of  movement  and
           freedom of protection;
       (c)   these  rights  are  among  the  important  fundamental   rights
           enshrined in our Constitution;


       (d)  it further mobilised people all over the world to such an extent
           that the United Nations designated 21 March as the International
           Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination;


       (e)  this massacre prompted the new  South  Africa  in  declaring  21
           March Human Rights Day; and


       (f)  racism still prevails and persists in  Southern  Africa  and  in
           many parts of  the  world,  and  that  its  elimination  is  the
           responsibility of all our citizens;


  (2) resolves that human rights abuse in South Africa and anywhere in  the
       world is a threat to justice everywhere and calls for the elimination
       thereof; and


  (3) appeals for -


       (a)  the end of all forms of violence against women and children;
       (b)  the end of religious and ethnic conflict as evident  in  Nigeria
           and India;


       (c)  the end of the violation of the safety and  security  of  people
           and their right to self-determination in Palestine; and


       (d)   no  United  States-led  aggression,  without  Security  Council
           approval, against the people of Iraq.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Are  there  any
objections to the motion?

Ms C BOTHA: Deputy Chairperson, may I just move as an amendment:


  That this Council wishes an end to the use of weapons of mass destruction
  against the civil population of Iraq by its rulers.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Do  you  accept  the
amendment, hon Windvoël?

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL; Deputy Chairperson, the amendment is  rejected  with  the
contempt it deserves.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  The  amendment  is
rejected. Is there any objection to that?

motion.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  The  objections  of
those two parties are noted.

                             (Draft resolution)

Mnr J HORNE: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die brutale moord op mnr Johan de Jager van Oap  naby
       Upington;


  (2) dit eens is dat hierdie moord in 'n vreedsame  omgewing,  waar  goeie
       verhoudings tussen die verskillende gemeenskappe bestaan, 'n skok is;


  (3) daarvan kennis neem dat die gemeenskap  besorg  is  daaroor  dat  die
       beweerde  moordenaars  van  'n  provinsie  duisende  kilometers   van
       Upington af kom, wat op 'n georganiseerde bende-optrede kan dui;


  (4)  meen  al  die  leiers  in  die  gemeenskap  behoort  saam  met   die
       bevelvoerders en LUR van Veiligheid  en  Sekuriteit  te  vergader  om
       voorkomende strategieë te vestig; en

  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the brutal murder of Mr John De  Jager  from  Oap  near
       Upington;


  (2) is unanimous that this murder comes as a shock  in  a  peaceful  area
       where sound relationships exist amongst different communities;


  (3) takes  note  that  the  community  is  concerned  about  the  alleged
       murderers  coming  from  a  province  thousands  of  kilometres  from
       Upington,  which  could  possibly  point  to  the  activities  of  an
       organised gang;


  (4) is of the opinion that all the leaders in the community  should  meet
       with the commanders and MEC of Safety and Security      in  order  to
       set preventative strategies; and

Mr N M RAJU: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Shaun Pollock, the South African Cricket Captain has  been
       shorn of the captaincy of  the  national  team,  an  action  that  is
       tantamount to being labelled as the scapegoat for the  Proteas'  poor
       performances at the World Cup and the ills that bedevil South African
       cricket;


  (2) nevertheless wishes to record the nation's deep sense of appreciation
       and gratitude to the sacked captain for the manner in which  he  wore
       the mantle of responsibility when  he  took  over  the  helm  of  our
       national cricket team during a period of darkness  in  South  African
       cricket brought about by the Hansie Cronjé affair; and


  (3) further wishes the new captain, Graeme Smith, and the  Proteas  every
       success in the future and trusts that South African cricket  will  be
       ushered into a new era of exemplary achievements in the international
       arena, bringing back national pride and honour to  the  sports-loving
       South African nation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Any objection to the motion?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: I move as an amendment  that  the  paragraphs
(1) and (2) be substituted by the following paragraph:

       African cricket team and wishes to record the nation's deep sense  of
       appreciation and gratitude to the sacked captain for  the  manner  in
       which he wore the mantle of responsibility when he took over the helm
       of our national cricket team during a period  of  darkness  in  South
       African cricket brought about by the Hansie Cronjé affair; and

                             (Draft resolution)

Ms L JACOBUS: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes recent reports in the media  about  the  coup  in  the  Central
       African Republic;


  (2) supports the view by  President  Mbeki  that  the  African  continent
       should never tolerate the unconstitutional  transfer  of  power  from
       whichever quarters;


  (3) believes that Africa's problems cannot be solved  through  coups  and
       other unsavoury methods; and


  (4)  calls  upon  those  responsible  to  refrain  from  this  unbecoming
       behaviour and to pursue legitimate  means  towards  the  transfer  of
       power.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                              DRIVING LICENCES

                             (Draft resolution)

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern recent reports on  the  SAFM  radio  station  about
           political opportunism by a member of the DA the hon Mr Manny  de
           Freitas, who criticised the Gauteng government for introducing a
           R300 fine for late application in respect of card licences;


       (b)  that Mr De Freitas is reported to have said that  people  should
           have been given more time;


       (c)  that prospective applicants were given enough time to apply  for
           new card drivers' licences; and


       (d)  that this is once more one of the tactics  used  by  the  DA  to
           oppose every initiative by the ANC-led Government;


  (2) believes that the initiative by the Gauteng government is a  step  in
       the right direction to promote and enhance the rule of law; and
  (3) calls upon the DA to stop having a double tongue by talking about the
       rule of law when it suits them.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Any objection to the motion?

Mr L G LEVER: Deputy Chairperson, we object.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Your objection will be noted.

                             (Draft resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:

  (1) notes with  concern  recent  reports  in  a  Sunday  newspaper  about
       attempts by the MEC for Social Development, Prince  Gideon  Zulu,  to
       stall the distribution of much-needed food parcels in the province;
  (2) notes that Prince Zulu is once more politicising the delivery of much-
       needed services by accusing the Minister of Social Development of not
       consulting with him before these food parcels were distributed;


  (3) further notes that Prince Zulu alleges that food is being distributed
       by ANC people and yet it is the National Development Agency which  is
       responsible for food distribution; and

       distribution of food to people in need.

     NEPAD AND THE PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT - A VEHICLE FOR SOCIOECONOMIC
                  TRANSFORMATION, PEACE AND GOOD GOVERNANCE

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Deputy Chairperson, hon members and  delegates,  I  am
indeed very happy to join you  in  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  to
discuss  the  critical  challenges  we  face  in  the  country  and  on  the
continent.

The Partnership for Africa's Development is known as Nepad, as  it  provides
an opportunity to interact with government at all levels.

The Nepad programme is critical to the  reconstruction  and  development  of
the continent. It is therefore important that all sectors of society  become
involved in it. It should develop  into  a  concrete  programme  of  action,
involving all of us  at  all  levels  and  sectors,  both  governmental  and
nongovernmental.

It should be possible to develop an all-encompassing  programme  of  action,
because there is general consensus on the  continent  about  the  value  and
importance of Nepad.

Most importantly, Nepad introduces a  new  style  of  social,  economic  and
political governance. It is designed to make leaders  accountable  not  only
to their populations, but to their peers and neighbours as well.

Nepad's African Peer Review Mechanism is  based  on  the  reality  that  our
destinies are intertwined as African countries,  and  that  we  need  to  be
aware that our actions will influence our neighbours in a particular way.

The importance of parliamentary oversight as we strive for  the  revival  of
the continent cannot  be  overemphasised.  The  establishment  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament,  another  key  AU  structure,  is  therefore  vital.  We
believe members of this House can play a key role through this institution.

Our parliamentarians can seize the opportunity by forming links  with  their
colleagues on the continent and beyond, to market Nepad as well  as  monitor
its implementation. You would, through such parliament-to-parliament  links,
transcend boundaries that governments may not be able to bridge and  promote
popular democratic practices throughout the continent.

Given the many opportunities  offered  by  the  establishment  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament, we are concerned that, thus far, only 10 countries  have
ratified the protocol. We therefore hope that AU  member  states  that  have
not signed and ratified the protocol will do so in  order  to  expedite  the
launch of this important continental oversight body.

Related to the implementation of Nepad  is  the  imperative  of  eradicating
conflicts on some parts of the  continent.  There  is  a  clear  correlation
between peace and stability  on  the  one  hand,  and  economic  growth  and
sustainable development on the other.

Driven by this goal of creating a better Africa, South  Africa  is  actively
involved in conflict resolution  in  Burundi,  the  Democratic  Republic  of
Congo and other parts of the continent. Substantial progress has  been  made
in these endeavours already.

With regard to Burundi, we have scored some victories and secured three  out
of four ceasefire agreements, signed by the armed  movements  and  political
parties and the transitional government of Burundi. Work  is  continuing  to
implement the ceasefire agreements, and,  where  challenges  arise,  we  are
pleased that the various parties are  always  open  to  discussions  and  to
finding solutions.

We believe that Burundi has been through the worst  already,  and  that  the
situation can only improve. Although challenges  may  arise,  the  processes
and structures exist to resolve these, both within Burundi  and  externally.
The eventual return  to  constitutional  legitimacy  and  democracy  remains
critical for Burundi and other conflict-ridden  sister  countries.  We  hope
the belligerent parties  realise  the  urgency  with  which  this  needs  to
happen.

The African Union  continues  efforts  to  ensure  a  return  to  peace  and
stability in Sudan, Comoros, Somalia, Western Sahara and Côte  d'Ivoire.  To
ensure lasting  peace,  there  is  a  need  for  the  establishment  of  new
political systems which would take into account the diversity  within  these
societies.  Diversity  and  differences  should  be  viewed   as   providing
opportunities rather than as a threat to certain political classes.

The opportunities exist for vibrant,  viable  democratic  political  systems
and institutions to arise in these sister countries. Also  critical  is  the
creation of the necessary checks and balances.

The establishment of inclusive democratic  political  systems  would  permit
the renewal of mandates,  or  the  replacement  of  governments  should  the
electorate so decide, within the context of constitutionalised  systems.  It
would eliminate the reason for armed rebellions and  other  unconstitutional
activity. In this context, Deputy Chairperson, we condemn  the  coup  d'état
in the Central African Republic over the weekend.

I would like to invite the NCOP  to  find  ways  of  assisting  the  Burundi
people in particular, and other peoples affected by strife  in  general,  in
their  search  for  lasting  solutions.  Interaction  and  the  sharing   of
experiences  with  parliamentarians  in  these  countries  would  assist  in
spreading the message of peace, as well as in promoting democracy  and  good
governance throughout the continent.

Nepad  has  all  the  right  elements  which  should  make  it  succeed   in
extricating the continent from the abyss of  underdevelopment,  poverty  and
conflict. It is for this reason that we spare  no  effort  in  creating  the
right  conditions  for  it  to  succeed,  whether  locally  or  outside  the
continent.

It is this determination to succeed, among  other  things,  which  makes  us
concerned about the global security situation, in particular  the  American-
led campaign against Iraq. It is our well-considered  view  that  a  war  in
Iraq will aggravate the misery and poverty in Africa and other parts of  the
developing world. We  believe  it  would  reverse  all  our  gains  achieved
through the Nepad initiative, as it has the potential to  push  Africa  into
the background in the international arena.

We hope the United States and its allies  can  still  find  it  possible  to
avert war, even at this 11th hour, and allow  the  United  Nations  to  deal
with this matter in the manner  in  which  it  has  been  dealing  with  it,
multilaterally.

Deputy Chair, thank you for allowing me the  opportunity  to  interact  with
colleagues in this House on these important matters. I hope  there  will  be
more interaction on this topic in the NCOP as the year progresses. It is  an
important  matter  that  requires  the  collective  wisdom  of  the   public
representatives gathered here. I thank you, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

[Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Mr Chairperson, Deputy President and hon members of  the
House,  I  would  like  to  voice  my  appreciation  at  being  afforded  an
opportunity to participate in this debate. This is a very  important  debate
because we are discussing the rising up of the awesome snake of Africa.

Slogans were heard during our struggle  for  independence  saying:  ``Africa
must come back!'' They said: ``Africa will never be free until the South  is
free!'' That was during the time of the OAU, which was  looking  forward  to
the  liberation  of  African  countries  from  the   oppression   that   was
colonialism, apartheid and other forms of  the  oppressors'  programmes.  We
are now talking about the AU. [Interjections.]]

Ms C BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I regret that  the  speaker
is not being interpreted.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I am advised  that  on  the  speakers'
list  only  English  is  indicated  for   this   speaker.   [Interjections.]
Apparently this was arranged beforehand. I do not know if  it  is  possible,
but could interpreting be arranged by some means, please? Hon member,  would
you please continue?

[Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Mr Chairperson, hon members, I was still saying that  we
are now talking of AU, the transformation of the OAU into the  AU.  I  would
say that that is like a snake shedding its skin and a new  one  appearing  -
those who know - it's when a  snake  sheds  its  old  skin  and  a  new  one
appears. It is then that the awesome snake of  Africa  prepares  itself  for
the new challenges of globalisation.]

As we know, Nepad is a pledge by African leaders, inter alia,  to  eradicate
poverty and to place their countries, both  individually  and  collectively,
on a path of sustainable growth and development.

Surely this is anchored  in  the  determination  of  Africans  to  extricate
themselves and the  continent  from  the  malaise  of  underdevelopment  and
exclusion in a globalising world. From a  socioeconomic  perspective,  Nepad
will transform the continent from  various  forms  of  underdevelopment  and
poverty to the envisaged prosperity.
Actions speak louder than words. As an African in  the  South,  I  am  proud
about the leading and constructive  role  that  the  ANC-led  Government  is
playing in this regard. Unlike the apartheid regime, which was hell-bent  on
destabilising its neighbours and protecting foreign  interests,  our  caring
Government is lending a helping hand so that our fellow  Africans  may  live
and prosper.

This is no coincidence. The ANC, being the  oldest  liberation  movement  on
the continent, knows the history and sufferings of Africa. Hence it is  able
to respond and lead  accordingly.One  will  not  dwell  much  on  the  peace
missions our country has undertaken with  distinction,  namely  in  Burundi,
the DRC, etc. The hon Deputy President has eloquently  addressed  the  House
on that.

A  key  requirement   for   successful   socioeconomic   transformation   is
infrastructural development. Sound and  accessible  infrastructure  provides
much needed quality services, facilities and opportunities, particularly  to
the poor and those in isolated areas or  regions.  Our  Government,  through
various departments and parastatals, has taken the lead  with  projects  and
programmes.  To  name  but  a  few:  The  transfrontier  parks   are   being
established through the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.  We
are seeing the harmonisation of the railway  transportation  system  through
Spoornet, an arm of Transnet, extending up to Tanzania. The  SAA,  with  its
Open Skies initiative, has opened a route to Dakar and is also  involved  in
establishing alliances with other African airlines.

We have seen Telkom's assistance to Burkina Faso during the CAF  Cup,  which
left that country with  much-needed  telecommunications  infrastructure.  We
all know of the Maputo Corridor. As a Mpumalangan, I'm  proud  to  say  that
our province was instrumental in its establishment.  Currently,  the  US$1,2
billion Sasol natural gas pipeline is also under construction.

These projects have created a lot of job  opportunities,  enhanced  economic
growth and improved the quality of life of the masses they serve. These  are
but some of the  noble  causes  in  promoting  trade  and  co-operation  and
overcoming the inherited colonial divisions between African countries.

However, it is saddening, as the Deputy President has put  it,  that  as  we
speak about this  glorious  programme  Nepad,  it  may  be  overshadowed  or
downtrodden by the impending war against Iraq and the people of the world  -
because it is true that, ultimately, it is  the  people  in  the  developing
countries that will suffer the consequences if a war of  such  magnitude  is
to proceed.

Africa is defying all expectations and forecasts made  after  September  11,
which predicted a  stagnation  in  African  economic  growth.  Although  the
economies of some major industrialised  countries  have  slowed  down,  with
world trade growing by less than 2%. African economies, in  particular  that
of our country, have  shown  robust  growth  despite  this  global  economic
showdown.

According to the the UN Economic Commission for  Africa,  African  economies
grew by 4,3% during 2001,  which  is  significantly  higher  than  the  3,5%
growth in 2000, thus making Africa the only developing region to register  a
faster growth rate.

In conclusion, may I say that as the ANC we have no doubt  that  Nepad  will
succeed. Africa has already made significant progress in realising  some  of
the objectives of Nepad.
During the past decade many African countries have taken action  to  promote
socioeconomic  transformation.  We  have  witnessed   marked   progress   in
democratisation and constitutional reform, with a dramatic increase  in  the
holding of multiparty elections. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, the  poverty  levels  and  development  indices  of
Africa stand in stark contrast to the prosperity  and  achievements  of  the
developed world. Some of the well-worn indicators of this situation are  the
facts that in Africa 340 million people, or half  the  population,  live  on
less than $1 a day; that the mortality rate of  children  under  five  years
old is 140 per 1 000 and life expectancy at birth for the  whole  of  Africa
is only 54 years and decreasing; that only 58% of the population has  access
to safe water; that the rate of illiteracy for people over 15  is  41%;  and
that there are only 18 mainline telephones  per  1  000  people  in  Africa,
compared with 146 for the  world  as  a  whole  and  567  for  higher-income
countries.

These statistics indicate a level of economic and social  exclusion  of  the
vast majority of African peoples which can never be desirable for those  who
care about Africa or those who care about global stability. This picture  is
further complicated by the proliferation of a social class of  elite  rulers
in Africa who, in the words of President Mbeki,  seek  access  to  power  so
that they can corrupt the political order for personal gain at all costs.

Against this background South Africa has chosen the only  constructive  way,
the international model of regional and continental co-operation, to  engage
globalisation head-on. It has committed huge  energy  to  the  establishment
and leadership of the African Union  and  its  endorsing  of  Nepad  as  its
programme for socioeconomic development in Africa.

President Mbeki has built support and influence in global institutions  like
the  UN  and  the  Nonaligned  Movement  and  interaction  with  the   major
development partners in  order  to  create  awareness  of  mutual  need  and
benefit.  This  framework  has  been  heartily  embraced  by  the  developed
countries of the world, but also greeted with an  understandable  degree  of
cynicism. Socioeconomic transformation and good governance  need  more  than
political promises in international forums. When the spotlight  recedes  and
the sun sets in Africa, the hard truth to face is that  it  is  Africa,  not
the developed world, that will have to bridge this divide and  overcome  the
huge credibility gap between what Nepad and the AU offer and what they  will
eventually deliver.

Nepad is much further down the road than the Pan-African  Parliament,  which
has not even - we were told today - been ratified by more  than  10  African
states. To link these two in the same debate is to place an  unfair  shackle
on the potential of Nepad. The  Pan-African  Parliament  protocol  has  been
accepted by the heads of state, but here it faltered. There  seems  to  have
been very little  communication  between  the  executives  and  the  people,
whilst its protocol specifically proposes a vision of a common platform  for
African peoples and their grass-roots organisations to be more  involved  in
discussions and decision-making on the problems and  challenges  facing  the
continent.

We also know that the success of Nepad hinges very  much  on  the  perceived
effectiveness of the much heralded peer review mechanism for both  political
and  economic  governance  which  has  been  set  as  a  quid  pro  quo  for
socioeconomic upliftment.

I want to highlight  the  latest  fundamental  breach  -  well,  the  Deputy
President is here, so let me address it to him - by his own ranks  of  these
preconditions for good  governance,  the  subject  matter  of  most  of  our
debates when you are in the  House,  hon  Deputy  President.  This  was  the
recent remark by Minister Dlamini-Zuma to the Press Club  in  Pretoria  that
this Government will never condemn its Zimbabwean counterpart  while  it  is
in power. Such dogmatic utterances will never lead to the functioning  of  a
meaningful peer review mechanism. On the contrary, it completely  undermines
the credibility of these structures and this Government.

The Mugabe regime is exactly guilty of behaviour  which  categorises  Africa
as a high investment risk and deserving of  condemnation.  It  is  precisely
this kind of behaviour which is the opposite of good  governance.  The  very
countries which we wish to engage in Nepad clearly  recognise  human  rights
abuses in Zimbabwe and the resulting destruction there of the  socioeconomic
progress of that country.

The  effectiveness  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  and  Nepad   must   be
accompanied  by  a  record  of  credibility.  This  requires   courage   and
leadership, not duplicity, on the issues of human rights and  human  wrongs.
Do not let us down by turning the African century into  the  African  decade
and do not remain quite in the face  of  evil  in  the  hope  of  short-term
gains. The long-term  cost  in  lost  socioeconomic  transformation  is  too
ghastly to contemplate. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S V  NAICKER:  Deputy  Chairman,  firstly,  I  have  taken  note  of  the
statement made by the hon Deputy President  and,  of  course,  some  of  the
terms that he used, as the need for a  concrete  programme  and  interaction
with all those that are involved. He said  in  his  statement  that,  in  an
exercise of such nobility, only 10 countries have signed thus far. But  that
does not mean that those who have taken the initiative must lose hope.

I have also taken note of the statements made by the  hon  Windvoël  and  Ms
Botha regarding the socioeconomic levels of the people in the area.

Nepad  and  the  Pan-African  Parliament  are  vehicles  for   socioeconomic
transformation, peace, growth and good governance. We are on  the  threshold
of an era when Africa, the continent, has to  awaken  to  the  realities  of
economic development. That is what it is all about.  From  the  moment  that
Kwame Nkrumah broke the shackles of colonialism and gave  Africa  the  taste
of political freedom when Ghana was  born,  the  all  important  freedom  of
economic self-sufficiency has remained elusive to  Africans  in  many  other
parts of Africa.

The nobility of the Nepad and  the  concept  of  Pan-African  Parliament  as
expounded at Lusaka Summit in July 2001 are  a  clear  indication  that  the
time has come to firmly resolve the problems  and  obstacles  that  obstruct
economic upliftment.

May I say, for the sake of the  record,  that  this  exercise  has  so  much
humanitarianism within it - and history is  not  without  its  liberators  -
that, as a result, those that have taken the initiative will go down as  the
liberators of Africa.

Can we deny  that  Africa  has  an  abundance  of  natural  resources?  Most
importantly its people  are  really  the  greatest  assets  of  Africa.  The
mineral  resources,  of  course,  have  been  the  envy  of  many   colonial
countries. Just in passing,  let  me  give  you  an  example,  Sir,  of  the
resources that are found in the province that I  come  from.  Does  the  hon
Deputy President know the Tugela Basin?  For  the  information  of  the  hon
members here, the Tugela Basin has been on the drawing board  for  the  last
55 years. The  water  that  flows  into  the  sea  can  build  another  four
Johannesburgs, four Cape Towns and three Durbans and still have  a  surplus.
With the water, mineral and labour resources, one  can  understand  what  we
can turn that to in an economic area.

What Nepad says is that Africa must take ownership  of  the  aspirations  of
African people. That is what Nepad says. Mutual respect, dignity and  shared
responsibility  and  accountability  are   prerequisites   for   sustainable
development. At the end of  the  day,  it  is  sustainable  development.  We
cannot eat flags and speeches. Nepad is envisaged as a long-term  vision  as
an African-owned and African-led development programme.

Just as  the  objective  of  the  Nepad  is  to  give  impetus  to  Africa's
development in order to catch up with the developed parts  of  the  rest  of
the world, we are faced with the threat of war all around us. Worse,  still,
we already have war on our hands - the war of HIV/Aids, which is one of  the
most pressing questions facing our people in this area. It is a war that  we
have to  fight,  which,  like  a  pestilence,  is  causing  destruction  and
decimating our  population.  Both  these  threats  are  certain  to  have  a
negative impact on whatever efforts are marshalled to eradicate  poverty  in
our continent.

At this juncture in  world  history,  it  is  imperative  that  First  World
developed  countries  contribute  to  the  efforts  of  the   underdeveloped
nations. The eradication of poverty, in  the  first  place,  cannot  be  the
responsibility only of the African states. It cannot be. There has to  be  a
question in history as to  who  contributed  to  the  state  of  affairs  in
Africa. And the fact that their own economies benefited from  the  resources
taken from Africa must prick their conscience so  that  they  contribute  to
the wellbeing of Africans.

South Africa is the engine  room,  as  the  Deputy  President  stated  here.
Honest interaction is expected from this forum. South Africa is  the  engine
room and has the responsibility. Together,  with  all  the  honesty  at  our
command, we have to see that Nepad becomes a success. Any failure will be  a
reflection on the existence of this House [Applause.]
Mnr P  A  MATTHEE:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  by  die  bespreking  van  hierdie
onderwerp is dit allereers nodig om weer vir 'n oomblik net  stil  te  staan
by wat die oogmerk van Nepad is.

Die hoofoogmerk van Nepad is om armoede in Afrika uit te wis en  om  Afrika-
lande, beide individueel en gesamentlik, op 'n pad van volhoubare  groei  en
ontwikkeling te plaas om sodoende die  marginalisering  van  Afrika  in  die
globalisasieproses te keer.

Die President het in sy rede op 14 Februarie hierdie jaar,  toe  hy  gepraat
het oor Nepad, gesê:


  Considerable progress was made during the course of last year  to  cement
  partnerships within Africa and further afield, so that we  can  translate
  Nepad, without delay, into concrete projects that will impact  positively
  on the lives of the people of the continent. We are heartened by the fact
  that Africa's sense of urgency to start implementing  this  programme  is
  shared by governments, the  private  sector  and  civil  society  on  all
  continents.

Dit voorspel vir ons ook wat hierdie jaar behoort te gebeur en  dat  hierdie
jaar werklik gesien moet word as 'n jaar waarin erns  gegee  moet  word  aan
die implementering van hierdie projekte.

Die unieke  krag  van  Nepad  is  daarin  geleë  dat  dit  gelei  word  deur
volmagtigde Afrika-leiers. Dit is hierdie uniekheid wat  gebruik  moet  word
om die baie goeie inisiatiewe wat die ondersteuning  en  die  toewyding  van
Afrika se politieke leiers nodig het, te versterk. Die hoofde van  state  in
Afrika kan hulle geloofwaardigheid en hulle politieke gewig gebruik om  nuwe
paaie oop te breek en bestaandes wat geblokkeer  is  weer  oop  te  maak  om
sodoende Afrika weer op te bou en te vernuwe.

Ons is saam met vele andere bly en verheug oor president Mbeki  se  onlangse
kritiek  op  Zimbabwe  se  grondbeleid  wat  volg  kort  op  'n  verrassende
vermaning  aan  president  Mugabe  deur  die  Nigeriese   leier,   president
Obasanjo, dat die Zimbabwiese president reëlings moet tref om uit te tree.

President Mbeki het volgens mediaberigte op 'n besoek aan Botswana  gesê  hy
het die Zimbabwiese  regering  meegedeel  dat  die  herverdeling  van  grond
nagestreef moet word op 'n wyse wat vir  alle  Zimbabwiërs  aanvaarbaar  is.
President Mbeki se jongste uitlatings het sterk hoop laat opvlam  dat  Suid-
Afrika 'n nuwe, beduidende rol  kan  speel  om  die  oplaaiende  Zimbabwiese
krisis op te los.

Die president van AgriSA  het  volgens  mediaberigte  dit  as  'n  reusestap
vorentoe bestempel, en selfs Zimbabwe se vernaamste opposisieparty,  wat  in
die jongste tyd skerp kritiek op president Mbeki uitgespreek  het,  het  ook
hierdie  jongste  uitspraak  van  ons  President  verwelkom.  Die  party  se
verteenwoordiger het bygevoeg dat daar nou verdere druk op  die  Zimbabwiese
regering deur die President uitgeoefen moet word sodat hulle  kan  ophou  om
hulle mense se regte te skend.

Die enigste weerklank het natuurlik weer eens gekom van die DP - leier,  mnr
Tony Leon,  wat  volgens  mediaberigte  gesê  het  die  uitlatings  van  die
President is allermins 'n veroordeling van grondbesettings  in  Zimbabwe  en
dat hy president Mugabe eintlik aanhits om op sy gekose weg voort te gaan.

Baie goeie inisiatiewe is al in die verlede ontwikkel, soos die  Lagos  Plan
van Aksie en die Abuja Verdrag, maar dit het hoofsaaklik  weens  drie  redes
gefaal, naamlik tydsberekening, gebrek aan vermoë om te implementeer  en  'n
gebrek aan werklike politieke wil.

Ons is by 'n belangrike  kruispad  in  ons  geskiedenis.  'n  Beduidende  en
belangrike ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Mr Chairperson, with the discussion of  this  topic  it  is
first of all necessary to pause for a moment and look at what the  objective
of Nepad is.

The main objective of Nepad is to eradicate poverty in  Africa  and  to  put
African countries, both individually and jointly, on a road  of  sustainable
growth and development, in so doing to stop the  marginalisation  of  Africa
in the globalisation process.

In his address on 14 February of this year, when he spoke  about  Nepad  the
President said:


  Considerable progress was made during the course of last year  to  cement
  partnerships with Africa and further afield, so  that  we  can  translate
  Nepad, without delay, into concrete projects that will impact  positively
  on the lives of the people of the continent. We are heartened by the fact
  that Africa's sense of urgency to start implementing  this  programme  is
  shared by governments, the  private  sector  and  civil  society  on  all
  continents.

This predicts to us what ought to  happen  this  year  and  that  this  year
should surely be seen as a year in which we  should  be  serious  about  the
implementation of these projects.

The unique power of Nepad lies in the fact that it is being led  by  African
leaders invested with full authority. It is this uniqueness which should  be
used to strengthen the many good initiatives  which  need  the  support  and
dedication of Africa's political leaders. The heads of state in  Africa  can
use their credibility and political weight to open up new paths and to  open
up existing ones which have been blocked, in so doing to renew and build  up
Africa once again.

Together with many others we are glad and overjoyed about President  Mbeki's
recent criticism regarding Zimbabwe's land policy which follows  shortly  on
a surprising  admonishing  to  President  Mugabe  by  the  Nigerian  leader,
President Obasanjo, that the Zimbabwean President should  make  arrangements
to step down.

On a visit to Botswana, according to media  reports,  President  Mbeki  said
that he told the Zimbabwean  government  that  the  redistribution  of  land
should be pursued in a  manner  which  is  acceptable  to  all  Zimbabweans.
President Mbeki's recent remarks  has  made  hopes  rise  again  that  South
Africa can play a  new  decisive  role  to  solve  the  building  Zimbabwean
crisis.

According to media reports, the President of AgriSA has described this as  a
huge step forward and even Zimbabwe's main opposition party, which  recently
expressed strong criticism to President Mbeki, has also welcomed the  latest
remarks of our President. The  party's  representative  added  that  further
pressure should now be put on the Zimbabwean government by the President  so
that they can stop violating the rights of their people.

The only echo once again of course came from the  DP  leader  Mr  Tony  Leon
who, according to media reports, said that the remarks of the  President  is
least of all a condemnation of the occupation of land in Zimbabwe  and  that
he is in fact inciting President Mugabe to continue on his chosen path.

Many good initiatives have been developed in the past, such as  for  example
the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty, but this  mainly  failed  for
three reasons, namely: timing, a lack of ability to implement and a lack  of
real political will.

We are at  an  important  crossroads  in  our  history.  A  significant  and
important ...]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Chairperson, I was listening to the speech  and  abruptly
the interpretation was cut off.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, that happened all  of  a  sudden.
Hon members will remember that this has been a constant worry right  through
the whole session. If you could bear with us,  I  am  sure  they  are  doing
something about it. Continue, hon member.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, dit klink of dit weer aangekom het. As ek  mag,
sal ek graag net 'n oomblik wil kry om die vorige paragraaf te herhaal.
Baie goeie inisiatiewe is al in die verlede ontwikkel, soos die  Lagos  Plan
van Aksie en die Abuja Verdrag, maar dit het hoofsaaklik  weens  drie  redes
gefaal, naamlik tydsberekening, gebrek aan vermoë om te implementeer  en  'n
gebrek aan werklike politieke wil.

Ons is by 'n belangrike  kruispad  in  ons  geskiedenis.  'n  Beduidende  en
belangrike aantal leiers op die kontinent en oorsee wat werklik  verbind  is
tot  die  hernuwing  van  die  vasteland  het  na  vore  gekom.   Dit   word
geïllustreer deur vooruitgang in die onlangse  tyd  en  die  ooreenkoms  oor
internasionale  ontwikkelingsdoelwitte  en  'n  gemeenskaplike  agenda   vir
Afrika.

Nepad voorsien drie nuwe sleutelelemente: eerstens,  dit  is  en  word  deur
Afrika ontwikkel, bestuur en besit; tweedens, dit bring die  konsep  van  'n
nuwe vennootskap met  wedersydse  verbintenisse,  verpligtinge,  bydraes  en
voordele; en derdens, Afrika onderneem sekere verpligtinge en  verbintenisse
wat nou nie voorwaardes is wat van buite die kontinent  kom  nie,  maar  wat
deur Afrika vir Afrika ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, it sounds as if it came back on  again.  If  I
may, I would like to take a moment to repeat the previous paragraph.

Many good initiatives have been developed in the past, such as  for  example
the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty, but this mainly failed  as  a
result of three reasons, namely: timing, a lack of ability to implement  and
a lack of real political will.

We are at  an  important  crossroads  in  our  history.  A  significant  and
important number of leaders on the continent and abroad  have  come  forward
who  are  really  dedicated  to  the  renewal  of  the  continent.  This  is
illustrated  by  progress  in  recent   time   and   the   agreement   about
international development aims and a joint agenda for Africa.

Nepad provides three new key elements: firstly,  it  is  developed,  managed
and owned by Africa; secondly, it brings the concept of  a  new  partnership
with  mutual  agreement,  obligations,  contributions  and  advantages;  and
thirdly, Africa undertakes certain obligations and agreements which are  not
conditions coming from outside the continent  but  from  Africa  for  Africa
...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr P A MATTHEE: I thank you.

Ons  moet  dit  met  hierdie  waardevolle  geleentheid   ...   [Onhoorbaar.]
[Applous.] [With this  valuable  opportunity  we  should  ...]  [Inaudible.]
[Applause.]]

Rev P MOATSHE: Modulasetilo, Motlatsa Moporesidente wa lefatshe la  rona  le
le tlotlegang le Ntlo yotlhe, Motswana a re, kgomo  e  tshwarwa  ka  dinaka,
motho o tshwarwa ka mafoko a gagwe. [Chairperson, the  Deputy  President  of
our beloved country, and the House, a person is caught by the statements  he
makes.]

I am saying this because there was a  contradiction  in  the  speech  of  Ms
Botha. She started with congratulations for what Nepad has embarked on,  but
at the end she started attacking our leaders for coming  up  with  political
promises which are empty. It is imperative for Ms Botha and  those  who  are
with her in her camp to know where we come from. We have a history  in  this
country, and the leaders she is referring to are the very leaders  who  have
brought us to where we are today. Those were not empty political promises!

We were geared to the very serious business to struggle for  the  liberation
of the people of this part of the continent  and  for  the  continent  as  a
whole. Therefore she does not understand. She lives  in  the  past.  She  is
talking like a dog that chases its tail and will never be able to catch  it.
[Laughter.] I am saying this because there is a lot of misunderstanding.

According to my understanding, the war in Iraq is a war against God. If  the
UN says no to war, and the people of the countries of the world  say  no  to
war, then they are on the side of peace and peace is the fruit  of  justice.
Where there is no justice there can be no  peace,  and  where  there  is  no
peace there is no justice. Nebuchadnezzar had to eat grass because he was  a
superpower, but waged war against God, who is the author of all  things.  We
must be careful because, no matter where in this world, humanity is  created
in God's image. If you kill, you endeavour to kill  God.  That  is  why  the
Gospel says, ``Thou shalt not kill.''

We have leaders in this country who have led us to where we are  today,  and
that makes us proud to be South Africans. Many countries of the  world  envy
South Africa because we have men  and  women  inspired  with  foresight  and
vision. We must be proud and encourage our leaders  by  assuring  them  that
they are on the right course. I am saying, as a believer, that  they  comply
with the statute of the Gospel imperative. That is why they are doing  this,
charted by the Freedom Charter, which summarises the Gospel in very  concise
terms. Therefore we are on a good course.

Africa has come a long way since what was called the  African  decade,  when
most of the African countries were liberated - a decade of hope, of  dreams,
of visions, for Africa was free and was going to continue to fight  for  the
total liberation of this continent.

It seems like yesterday that  the  OAU  was  launched  in  Addis  Ababa  to,
amongst other things, promote unity and solidarity  amongst  African  states
and  achieve  a  better  life  for  the  people  of  Africa.  What  happened
thereafter was another story, for Africa  was  plagued  with  endless  wars,
poverty, corruption, genocide - the list is endless.  However,  as  our  hon
President Mbeki often says, ``Africa is an Africa of hope.''

If we have leaders like those South Africa has produced, men and women  with
foresight and vision, leaders who withstood the test of time  and  the  test
of ages, leaders who went through the  grinding  mill  of  life  experience,
those are the leaders in the African society, those are the leaders  of  the
ANC, leaders who are on the right course, leaders who project a dignity  for
Africa, urging everybody to comply.

It seems like  yesterday  when  we  also  celebrated  our  first  day  as  a
liberated country, having experienced a  miraculously  peaceful  transition,
thereby setting a precedent in the  history  of  the  world.  We  even  then
realised the importance of peace and stability as a  fundamental  foundation
to our own democracy and its future.

We realised that without peace in our democracy there would be no  hope  for
a prosperous tomorrow. The struggles of our people would have been  with  no
benefit. Peace is the fruit of  justice,  as  I  have  already  said.  Their
hopes, dreams, ambitions and visions would have remained just  that  -  mere
visions, dreams, ambitions and hopes - and those too would  have  eventually
died had instability continued.

One thing that history has  taught  us  in  particular  from  our  very  own
African experience in the post-liberation period  is  that  peace  and  good
governance are imperatives for sustainable development. They  are  the  fuel
that takes the truck of progress  forward.  Without  that  fuel,  the  truck
cannot move ... [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Deputy Chairperson, I have to begin  by  saying
that I continue to remain puzzled as to understanding exactly what is  being
demanded of the Government of South  Africa  with  respect  to  Zimbabwe.  I
think  we  have  made,  as  this  country,  very  clear  statements  on  our
perspective with  respect  to  Zimbabwe.  The  clear  perspective  has  been
repeated, and repeated again, that we would not in  South  Africa  have  the
form of land policy that has been implemented in  Zimbabwe.  Our  Government
has stated this more than once.  Our  President  has  made  this  statement,
certainly  in  Botswana,  but  before  that  he  made   similar   statements
expressing concern about the manner of implementation of the policy on  land
redistribution, while pointing out very  clearly  that  land  redistribution
has to occur because the struggle in Zimbabwe  was  a  struggle  around  the
question of land.

So I am not sure exactly what is being asked of us, beyond perhaps going  to
war with Zimbabwe, and clearly we would not go to war with that country  nor
any country on our continent. So I remain puzzled  as  to  exactly  what  is
being asked of our Government. But let me come to the subject of debate  for
this afternoon.

I think it is clear from the contributions that we have heard  that  we  are
all agreed that Nepad and the  Pan-African  Parliament  stand  as  important
vehicles for socio-economic transformation and the promotion  of  peace  and
good governance on the African  continent.  I  think  as  we  consider  this
subject, and in our deliberations today, it is important, as  we  have  said
in many other meetings and fora, that we as members of  Parliament  need  to
be informed on the perspectives that we present in this House.

Allow me to refer to the recent  communique  emanating  from  the  Heads  of
State and Government Implementation  Committee  on  Nepad.  A  meeting  took
place on Sunday 9 March this very year, a meeting  in  which  our  President
participated, and produced a set of documents that are freely  available  to
members of the public and to members of Parliament.  In  those  documents  I
think the hon Botha would find a very clear indication of the  very  reasons
for  the  foremost  statistics  that  she  outlined  on  Africa  -  poverty,
underdevelopment, poor infrastructure and so on, facts that we all know  and
which Nepad is a response to.

The steering committee indicated in its  meeting  the  need  for  the  Nepad
steering committee  to  continue  with  its  negotiations  on  a  number  of
important issues. They highlighted in the steering committee  the  need  for
greater flexibility on the part of trading partners  in  granting  the  much
needed trade preferences to Africa and the developing world. They  mentioned
the special trade access that we have made reference  to,  with  respect  to
our natural resources and products of the African continent. They also  made
reference to the need to see a reduction in subsidies that are paid to  farm
producers in Europe, in the United States and other parts of  the  developed
world - subsidies that deny  Africa  access  to  markets  of  the  developed
world.

It  is  this  form  of   policy   that   contributes   to   the   continuing
underdevelopment of Africa. We do not choose to  be  underdeveloped.  It  is
the action of the developing world towards us that underdevelops us, and  we
need,  as  members  of  Parliament,  to  be  assisting  our  Government   in
challenging these  very  areas.  The  low  commodity  prices  for  commodity
trading nations are a  problem,  and  therefore  commodity  prices  must  be
addressed.

We also heard a call on the African group of ambassadors in Geneva  and  the
African ministers of trade to intensify their efforts at ensuring  that  all
these issues of interest to the continent, including  previous  commitments,
are fully considered at subsequent meetings  and  engagements  with  trading
partners. It seems to me that if we as members of Parliament  are  concerned
about ensuring the development of Africa,  it  is  these  areas,  which  the
steering committee made reference to,  that  we  as  members  of  Parliament
should be paying attention to. How much, as members  of  Parliament,  do  we
talk about the subsidies that are paid to agricultural producers  in  Europe
and elsewhere? How much do we talk about the trade preferences granted to  a
range of countries? But what are we doing to advocate a  reduction  in  this
form of support and a more favourable regime for our continent?

We are not doing enough as members of Parliament. We are not saying  enough,
we spend too much time criticising our leaders instead of engaging with  the
West, which is underdeveloping our continent. I think  we  should  be  doing
much more.

Nepad clearly is the vehicle for ensuring the development of our  continent,
the development of Africa in unity.  The  African  Union  is  the  political
organ that will ensure adequate policy  formulation  and  action  on  agreed
policies.

The Pan-African Parliament is the body that we have  charged  with  ensuring
African people's contribution to and participation in  all  the  issues  and
practices that directly impact on  their  lives.  And  I  think  it  is  sad
testimony to the responsiveness of a number of our African parliaments  that
43 of them have not as yet ratified the protocol.  We  congratulate  the  10
that have, and I think as South Africa's Parliament we would  want  to  take
action with the 10 to ensure that we speed up  the  process  of  encouraging
other African parliaments to act on the need to ratify the protocol.

We will use our presence in African fora and  other  international  fora  to
encourage our African parliaments to ensure that they  ratify  the  protocol
so that we can, in this year, have the first inaugural meeting of  the  Pan-
African Parliament. It is  an  important  obligation  on  us  as  the  South
African Parliament to ensure that indeed the  Pan-African  Parliament  comes
to life.

I think there are three critical  characteristics  of  Africa  that  provide
evidence that supports the decision to  adopt  Nepad  as  our  framework  of
development and to create a Pan-African Parliament. The first is  this  dire
poverty of Africa that has been referred to today.  And  I  think  the  dire
poverty is being responded to by a coherent,  co-ordinated  policy  response
which we see as Nepad and its programmes.

The  second  critical  characteristic  is  the   need   for   economic   and
infrastructure development on our continent as important  vehicles  for  job
creation and economic growth. Again Nepad provides  the  way  and  framework
for us.
The third critical feature is  the  challenge  of  developing  all  Africa's
human  resources  with  the  objective  of  supporting  peace   and   people
development on our continent. President Mbeki, speaking at the beginning  of
the meeting of the Nepad steering committee, made reference to the need  for
us to ensure that through  Nepad's  programmes,  women  and  girls,  as  the
majority population on our continent, are not marginalised and left  out  of
the process of  development.  Therefore  it  is  vital,  as  we  review  the
activities of Nepad and the actions of the African Union, that we  focus  on
whether indeed  women  and  girls  are  enjoying  progress  and  development
support on our continent.

Nepad, in my view, is the coherent plan. The  Pan-African  Parliament  is  a
response to all of these, but,  more  particularly,  it  ensures  the  vital
functions of  people  participation.  Too  often  in  past  initiatives,  as
referred to  by  the  hon  Moatshe,  we  have  not  seen  sufficient  people
participation, sufficient government contact with the people,  and  bringing
a Parliament of Africa into being ensures that for the  first  time  African
development will be discussed by Africa's public  representatives  with  the
people of Africa.

Secondly,  we  introduce  accountability  and  transparency.   International
matters as subjects of international development have  often  been  left  to
the domain of the executive, and -parliaments have played a minimal role  in
ensuring  that  they  have  oversight  of   international   agreements   and
international  deliberations.  Through   the   Pan-African   Parliament   we
introduce a new accountability, a new transparency, to African matters.

The third aspect is that through the  Pan-African  Parliament  we  build  an
important bridge between the African Union and  the  public  representatives
of the people. No longer, as with the organisation of  African  Unity,  will
it be the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and  the  Presidents  who  decide  on
Africa. We as Parliaments must play a role in deciding on  Africa,  and  the
Pan-African Parliament assures that.

A fourth aspect is that we are finally integrated into African matters.  The
Nepad report in March that I have  referred  to  indicates  that  the  Nepad
steering committee is  proceeding  apace  with  its  work.  On  reading  it,
despite my excitement  at  the  progress  that  the  steering  committee  is
making, I am horrified that as Parliament we are not  considering  the  work
of the steering committee nor ensuring that we are  in  step  with  what  is
being done. The progress is exciting,  but  again  we  parliamentarians  are
allowing ourselves to be left behind. I  think  that  the  Deputy  President
made a very important point when he called on parliamentarians and the  NCOP
to deliberate on this subject again and  again  and  again  to  ensure  that
indeed we are totally conversant with progress with  respect  to  Nepad  and
with progress with respect to the African Union.

I think the report from the steering committee  meeting  provides  a  useful
framework for examination by members in the National Council  of  Provinces,
and I would encourage each one of us to  extract  the  communique  from  its
website to ensure that indeed we begin this kind of examination  of  whether
we are making progress.

It is important, as I have stated, for us to ensure that we encourage  other
African countries to ratify the protocol on the Pan-African  Parliament.  As
the Parliament of South Africa, we  have  indicated  that  we  are  keen  to
offer, through our President, our leadership in the assembly of the  African
Union. We have indicated an interest in offering  to  host  the  Pan-African
Parliament, at least its early meetings, to  ensure  that  we  do  get  this
important structure off the ground.

It is vital that South Africa, which  enjoys  today  a  thriving  democracy,
ensures that that democracy extends beyond the borders of South Africa  into
the totality of Africa. An important characteristic of our development  from
now on has to be the existence of structures of good governance, and  it  is
parliaments that supervise the existence of structures  of  good  governance
and that ensure that  we  have  a  standard  and  framework  throughout  the
continent which each of us can learn from and  mirror.  Certainly  the  Pan-
African  Parliament  and  Nepad   are   our   vehicles   for   socioeconomic
transformation, for the promotion of peace and security and good  governance
on our continent.

I thank the Deputy President for having participated in this debate and  the
hon members for having made very important and useful  contributions.  Again
I request Ms Botha of the DP to kindly study the situation  of  Africa  very
carefully so that we know why there is poverty, so that we  know  why  there
is underdevelopment and do not lay the blame on those who have  merely  been
present in Government for eight and a half years and prior  to  that  played
no role in underdeveloping Africa. Thank you very much, Deputy  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

     CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA FOURTH AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Deputy  Chairperson,
thank you very much. We should remember that Parliament passed  four  pieces
of legislation last year that shared a common objective, namely to enable  a
member of a legislature or municipal council to become a member  of  another
party whilst retaining membership of that  legislature  or  council  and  to
enable an existing party to merge with another party, or to  subdivide  into
more than one party, or to subdivide with any one subdivision  merging  with
another party.

The constitutional validity of the legislation that  Parliament  passed  was
subsequently challenged by certain political parties  that  are  represented
in this House. On 4 October 2002, in the case of United Democratic  Movement
v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others,  the  Constitutional
Court held that crossing-of-the-floor legislation for  national,  provincial
and local government was not inconsistent with the  Constitution.  Regarding
the Loss or Retention of Membership of National and Provincial  Legislatures
Act, 2002, however, the Constitutional Court held that  Parliament  did  not
have the power to effect the provisions contemplated in that  Act  by  means
of an ordinary Act  of  Parliament,  as  opposed  to  an  Act  amending  the
Constitution. This led to the introduction of the Bill that  is  now  before
this House.

Hon members will agree  that  we  have  already  discussed  the  merits  and
demerits of the principle underlying this legislation at  great  length.  In
fact, Parliament made its will abundantly clear last  year  when  it  passed
the four Acts that I have already referred to. I am not going to revisit  or
dig up the old arguments that were raised in respect of this legislation.  I
would, however, like to reflect on some interesting  aspects  regarding  the
history and practical application of the crossing-of-the-floor phenomenon.
When the legislation was put to the vote  last  year,  it  was  opposed  by,
among others, the UDM, the IFP and the ACDP. Subsequent to the  judgment  of
the Constitutional Court, the window period for the crossing  of  the  floor
in the local government sphere came  into  effect  and  certain  councillors
from other parties,  for  reasons  best  known  to  themselves,  seized  the
opportunity to join, inter alia, the UDM, the IFP or the ACDP. The  UDM  was
the first litigant to challenge this legislation.  They  were  later  joined
by, among others, the IFP and the  ACDP,  on  so-called  moral  grounds,  as
being undemocratic, as denying fundamental political rights of  the  voters,
and the like.

In fact, the hon Holomisa  felt  so  strongly  about  the  matter  that,  in
paragraph 39 of his affidavit to the Constitutional Court, he stated,  among
other things, the following:


  I have been advised and I verily believe that  the  antidefection  clause
  forms an integral part of the representative  democracy  contemplated  in
  the  Constitution  and  in  Constitutional  Principle  VIII.  The  strong
  emphasis  on  participatory   democracy   and   accountability   in   the
  Constitution is entirely  incompatible  with  a  free  mandate  model  of
  representation that would allow for floor crossing. The  pure  list-based
  system of proportional representation  created  by  the  Constitution  is
  designed to establish legislators, through the parties, as  delegates  of
  the electorate, who remain accountable to the electorate  throughout  the
  term of the legislature. Representatives elected under  this  system  owe
  their seats solely to the fact that that they were placed on the list  of
  the party under whose  banner  they  fought  the  election.  To  allow  a
  legislator, having obtained his or her seat based upon the party list, to
  turn his or her back on the party  and  yet  retain  that  seat  for  the
  remainder of the term of the body, is antithetical to that system.

The hon Holomisa also stated in paragraph 66.2 of his affidavit that, and  I
quote again -


  ... the new system will be fundamentally unfair to those candidates whose
  names are on the existing  party  lists,  who  participated  in  election
  campaigns and who, but for the Acts, would  have  automatically  replaced
  defectors.

Strong words, strong sentiments, strong  convictions.  And  yet,  did  these
parties now inform those councillors wishing to join them, on the  basis  of
floor crossing, ``No, you are welcome to join us at the next  election,  but
we are in principle against accepting you together with your  seats  in  our
parties without there having been an election. We think  that  it  would  be
morally indefensible.'' I dare say they didn't do  that.  They  didn't  say,
``Ought we to receive you into our parties now that you have crossed on  the
basis of legislation that we are totally opposed to?'' They didn't.

Instead they accepted them, they embraced them and even bragged that  people
had crossed to their own parties. I don't know whether indeed that's  not  a
reflection of a very interesting model of  morality.  [Laughter.]  But  that
does not belong in the morality of the party that I represent, a party  that
eventually  accepted  that  they  were   right   and   that,   indeed,   the
antidefection clause must be done away with.

When we thought that we were doing that, they then opposed  us.  I  do  wish
that today they would support this legislation, so that we do  exactly  that
which they said earlier on was right,  namely  allow  people  to  cross  the
floor with their seats if they so  wish.  It  is  the  will  of  the  people
themselves, we were lectured in the mid-1990s, to allow people to cross  the
floor with their seats. Now the moment has come for them  indeed  to  do  as
they lectured and preached, namely support this legislation.

There is no part of the legislation that says that people shall  only  cross
to one party. It allows them to do so for whatever reasons they might  have.
It doesn't prescribe to them  where  they  should  go.  The  fact  that  the
majority crossed to the ANC can only be reflective of the ANC's  stature  in
society and its history in this country and, may I say, by the way,  in  the
world of struggles for national liberation. I thank you. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chair of Chairs. The  same  Bill  was  passed
last   year.   Unfortunately   the   Constitutional   Court   declared    it
unconstitutional because we passed it as an ordinary Act of  Parliament.  We
have now taken the route of amending the Constitution.

The objectives of the Bill and  what  it  entails  were  well  drummed  into
members, even recently by the hon Minister, and I am  not  going  to  repeat
it, but I just want  to  remind  hon  members.  Members  in  all  provincial
legislatures will be allowed to cross to any party of their choice, if  they
want to, without losing their seats as MPLs. The same goes  for  members  of
the National Assembly.

The good thing about this legislation is that in  the  first  15-day  window
period there will not be a threshold. A member is not required  to  gun  for
the 10% before he or she crosses. That requirement will only  apply  in  the
second window period.

As was said, parties can merge, subdivide and so  forth.  But  let  me  once
more remind members that during the window period parties  cannot  take  any
action against a member who wants to cross. That is only possible after  the
window  period.  It  can  happen  if  your  party  does   not   trust   you.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.] If you have indicated that you  want  to  cross
the floor, my advice is that you should not go back but just cross,  or  you
might regret it later.

There were some serious discussions about the seven days  given  to  parties
and the Speaker to submit  and  publish  the  names  in  the  Gazette.  This
concern was raised by KwaZulu-Natal, for example. But, as the committee,  we
agreed that the Speaker would have the names immediately after  parties  had
submitted their lists, so it would not be  necessary  to  give  the  Speaker
some optional time. It therefore will not  be  necessary  for  us  to  amend
this. We are very  comfortable  with  it.  I  am  happy  because  after  the
explanation by the department, the province also agreed.

I want to make this appeal to our members: Please don't jump the  gun.  Wait
until the President has signed the Bill into law. Make sure  you  only  jump
when the window is open. [Laughter.] If the window is not  clearly  visible,
please check with reliable members like me and we will take it  from  there.
[Laughter.]

My heart goes out to  those  hon  members  of  this  Chamber  who  might  be
affected when there are crossings or movements in various provinces.  It  is
true that some hon members might be withdrawn from this House. We are  going
to miss their contribution. It was the committee's wish  that  something  be
done to members who might be affected, but because of our electoral  system,
that will not be possible. However, the  committee  adds  its  concerns  and
views in regard to members who  are  going  to  be  affected.  We  hope  and
believe that one day something will be done. One  member  of  the  committee
went on to say, and I quote her:


  From now on very few members will be keen to serve in  the  NCOP  knowing
  that their stay in this Council might be short-lived by crossings in  the
  provinces.

She continued:


  I hope and believe that sense will prevail to some parties to  make  sure
  that those members who were valuable in this Council  can  be  redeployed
  somewhere.

This member is a mother, a sister and an hon member. She  went  on  to  say,
and I quote again:


  It is now obvious that whenever there will be a window period, members of
  this Council will be sitting on the edges of their seats.

Let me take this opportunity to thank those provinces that were  very  vocal
and showed concern about the future of their permanent delegates  who  might
be affected by this legislation.

To you, hon members  of  this  committee,  thank  you  very  much  for  your
undivided support. Only one sentence can describe you: No  matter  how  deep
the bottle is, the cream will always be on top.

We support this Bill. [Applause.]

Prince B Z ZULU: Deputy Chair, this Bill, the Constitution of  the  Republic
of South Africa  Fourth  Amendment  Bill,  signifies  the  maturity  of  our
democracy. This natural exercising of political choice,  which  has  already
been in operation at local  government  level,  is  now  being  extended  to
public representatives at  provincial  and  national  level,  who  are  now,
through this Bill, also afforded the opportunity to cross the floor.

The members of Parliament and the provincial legislatures who  were  trapped
in political parties they no longer could identify with will  now  have  the
opportunity to redeem themselves, as was  the  case  with  the  councils  in
municipalities across South Africa last year.  These  enthralled  provincial
and National Assembly members of parties do not have to  suffer  in  silence
any  longer.  This  amending  Bill  offers  them  an  opportunity  to  align
themselves with those who want to build this nation in a constructive way.
Last year South  Africans  witnessed  how  the  Democratic  Alliance  became
embroiled in internal wars and tension because of its  fight-back  political
approach. Tony Leon, in an effort to salvage credibility in a  very  divided
DP, had to govern Cape Town from Johannesburg. Many of his party members  at
national and provincial level became uncomfortable with this  approach,  but
had  to  suffer  in  silence  because  they  had  no  legislative  framework
empowering them to leave a party they could no longer identify with.

Later, because of the internal political wrangling, the Democratic  Alliance
became known as the ``Divided Alliance'', and,  after  even  more  political
turmoil,  they  became  known  as  the  ``Divorced  Alliance''.  [Laughter.]
Threats and counter-threats of court action  were  the  order  of  the  day.
Eventually sanity prevailed when legislation, namely the  Local  Government:
Municipal Structures Amendment Act, Act 20 of 2002, pronounced  itself  very
clearly on this matter. Therefore, in  the  Western  Cape,  when  the  local
councillors were afforded the opportunity to cross the floor, their  message
was unequivocal. The rest, as they say, is history.

With the passage of  this  legislation  MPs  and  MPLs  will  now  have  the
opportunity to cross the floor to a party that is actively  engaged  in  the
building  of  our  nation.  Those  members  of  Parliament  and  members  of
provincial legislatures who wish to  change  allegiance  will  hopefully  be
spared a great deal  of  the  drama  and  trauma  that  followed  the  local
government version of crossing the floor.

The legislation will ensure that there is uniformity in  all  three  spheres
of governance with regard to the loss or  retention  of  membership  of  the
national Parliament, provincial legislatures  and  all  municipal  councils.
Parties will be allowed to merge or  subdivide,  but  only  within  15  days
following the commencement  of  this  legislation.  If  they  fail  to  take
advantage of this opportunity, they  have  two  further  opportunities,  but
only after the second  year  after  elections  and  after  the  fourth  year
following elections. Members of all parties who  make  decisions  using  the
opportunity afforded by this  legislation  will  keep  their  seats  in  the
National Assembly or provincial legislature.

Recently South Africans also witnessed  how  ordinary  members  of  the  UDM
walked out of that party after losing faith  in  its  ability  to  remain  a
relevant political force in the building of the nation. Now UDM members  who
are public representatives  will  be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  remain
relevant in South African politics.

The Bill addresses all the issues raised by the Constitutional Court in  the
case of United Democratic Movement v President  of  the  Republic  of  South
Africa and Others. It provides for the  amendment  of  the  Constitution  as
required by the court. This now gives the green  light  for  all  those  who
seek political freedom for their current political shackles.

I have no doubt that the implications of this  Bill  will  have  a  profound
effect on all political parties. How  we,  collectively  and  as  individual
parties, deal with the inevitable changes  that  this  Bill  brings  to  the
political landscape will be a clear indication of our maturity  as  a  truly
democratic country.

As a representative of the ANC I am happy to  endorse  this  Bill.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]
Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP en die oorgrote meerderheid in  die
Wes-Kaap steun hierdie wetgewing. Ons beskou dit as 'n  verdere  uitbreiding
van ons demokrasie in Suid-Afrika. Ek wil graag vanmiddag  aansluit  by  ons
voorsitter, die agb Mokoena, deur  die  vraag  te  stel:  Hoe  raak  hierdie
wetgewing die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies?

In die eerste plek, permanente afgevaardigdes na die  NRVP  word  gesien  as
lede van die Parlement, maar by die toepassing van hierdie wet is  dit  lede
van die Nasionale Vergadering wat keuses kan uitoefen,  sonder  die  verlies
van hul amp. Met ander woorde, hulle het beskerming. As 'n lid van die  NRVP
na 'n ander party sou oorloop, en daardie party volgens die formule  in  die
provinsie nie sy posisie in hierdie Raad verseker nie,  dan  is  hy  sy  amp
kwyt. Met ander woorde, dit is 'n risiko  vir  hierdie  Raad  se  permanente
lede. Dit beteken dat lede van die Nasionale  Vergadering  die  voorreg  het
van beskerming, om 'n termyn van vyf jaar te kan voltooi,  terwyl  lede  van
die NRVP in gevaar is en dus nie die voorreg sal kan geniet nie -  mits  die
formule vir hulle geskik is.

Ek beskou dit as 'n vorm van diskriminasie teen die lede van  die  NRVP.  Ek
wil dus 'n beroep op die Minister en die Regering doen  dat  indien  'n  lid
van hierdie Raad deur die oorloopwetgewing in die provinsie geraak word,  en
sy voorregte daardeur verbeur, daardie lid na  sy  provinsie  sal  terugkeer
met die voorregte van 'n gewone lid, maar stemreg in die wetgewer  word  hom
ontsê.

Tydens die implementering van die finale Grondwet van  Suid-Afrika  het  ons
'n oorgangsmaatreël daargestel en is die beginsel reeds gevestig, waar  vier
lede destyds van 'n provinsie wat voorregte gehad het onder die  tussentydse
Grondwet daardie voorregte kon behou, sonder stemreg, en tot aan  die  einde
van die termyn kon aanbly. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, the New  NP  and  the  vast  majority  in  the
Western Cape support this legislation. We regard it as a  further  extension
of our democracy in South Africa. I would like to join our chairperson,  the
hon  Mokoena,  this  afternoon  by  putting  the  question:  How  does  this
legislation affect the National Council of Provinces?

In the first place, permanent delegates to the NCOP are seen as  members  of
Parliament, but upon the implementation of this Act, it will be the  members
of the National Assembly who can  exercise  choices,  without  relinquishing
their position. In other words, they have protection. If  a  member  of  the
NCOP crosses the floor to another party, and that party does not ensure  his
position in this Council according to the formula in the province, he  loses
his position. In other words, this is a risk for the  permanent  members  of
this Chamber. This implies that members of the National  Assembly  have  the
privilege of protection to enable them to complete a  term  of  five  years,
while members of the NCOP are at risk and therefore  will  not  be  able  to
enjoy that privilege - unless the formula is suited to them.

I regard this as a form of discrimination against members  of  the  NCOP.  I
would therefore like to appeal to the Minister and the Government that if  a
member of this Council is affected by the floor-crossing legislation in  the
province, and forfeits his privileges because of this,  that  member  should
return to his province with the privileges of  an  ordinary  member,  whilst
being denied the right to vote in the legislature.

During the implementation of the  final  Constitution  of  South  Africa  we
created a transitional measure and  thus  the  principle  has  already  been
established, since four members of a province who had privileges  under  the
interim Constitution at the time, could  retain  those  privileges,  without
the right to vote, and could remain to the end of the term.]

What is a worrying factor is that this Chamber could be used  as  a  dumping
ground for so-called ``doubtfuls'' in political parties.  This  will  indeed
have an impact on the effectiveness and the smooth running of the  House.  I
am of the opinion that we should address this problem. A  possible  way  out
is to protect members of the NCOP if they want  to  change  parties  in  the
same way, as I have  explained,  as  we  did  during  the  transition  phase
between the interim Constitution and the final Constitution.  It  is  unfair
that members of Parliament will have no protection if they cross  the  floor
unless the formula suits them.

I also want to give  attention  to  another  worrying  factor.  It  is  very
interesting that the dumping of so-called ``doubtfuls'' in this  Chamber  or
in  the  provinces  is  done  by  none  other  than  the  DP  and  the  IFP.
[Interjections.] We had an experience in the Southern  Cape,  where  the  DP
sent councillors on  holidays  and  paid  for  these  holidays  so  that  we
couldn't get  near  those  councillors.  We've  had  that  experience.  It's
intimidating. Where is Wikus Theron in this House? Why was he redeployed  to
the other House? Why were  three  members  of  the  IFP  redeployed  to  the
provinces, and three members from the province redeployed to Parliament?

Dis nou die bedmaats wat u hier sien. Dit is nou die manne met  wie  die  DP
in die bed is. Hulle is  in  die  bed  met  die  IVP;  hulle  steun  hierdie
wetgewing. Hulle is in die bed met die FA - hulle steun  hierdie  wetgewing.
Dit is nou die tipe party wat dubbele standaarde toepas. Dit  is  die  party
wat hoog opgee oor individuele regte en vryhede, maar wanneer daar regte  en
vryhede ter  sprake  kom,  dan  vertrap  hulle  daardie  regte  en  vryhede.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[These are the bedfellows that you now see here.  These  are  the  men  with
whom the DP is now in bed. They are in bed with the IFP; they  support  this
legislation. They are in bed with the FA;  they  support  this  legislation.
This is the type of party that applies double standards. This is  the  party
that makes a great song and dance about individual rights and freedoms,  but
whenever those rights and freedoms are under  discussion,  they  trample  on
those rights and freedoms. [Interjections.]]

Isn't it interesting that the DP, which  supports  this  legislation,  calls
the councillors that cross the  floor  ``crosstitutes''?  That's  what  they
call them. [Interjections.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chair, on a point of order: The member who  is  delivering
a speech now should not talk about the  IFP.  [Interjections.]  The  IFP  is
practising democracy.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Vilakazi,  what  the  member  has  spoken
about  here  is  relevant  to  the   topic.   Carry   on,   hon   Ackermann.
[Interjections.] Oh, your time has expired, hon member. [Interjections.]

Mr T G G MASHAMBA (Northern Province): Chairperson,  I  am  not  a  doubtful
member of the ANC. No arrogance intended, but it is true that the ANC  as  a
national liberation movement earned its leadership of South African  society
in the protracted struggle for the new democratic dispensation.

This well-earned position has  been  continuously  affirmed,  confirmed  and
endorsed by the South African electorate in the numerous  elections  at  the
national, provincial and local levels since 1994.

The ANC is only too aware of its responsibility to  continue  to  earn  this
leadership position in the process of the construction  and  development  of
our country, the African continent and the  global  community  as  a  whole.
Hence our relentless pursuit to continue to spearhead the unity of  all  our
people and of all political parties committed to the democratic  ideals  for
which many of our people have paid the highest price, as well as  the  unity
of the African continent, and  the  pursuit  of  world  peace,  justice  and
development. Our efforts in the SADC, Africa and further  afield  speak  for
themselves.

We as the ANC take the Constitution very seriously, but the Constitution  is
not carved in stone, and must therefore, at all material times, reflect  the
political realities of our society. In the early 1990s, discreet  geographic
elements and national groupings of the  so-called  ``boers'',  ``rooineks'',
``coolies'', ``boesmans'' and various ``kaffir'' groupings came together  to
lay the foundation for a new, nonracial, nonsexist, democratic,  united  and
progressive society.

It was a hectic period, full of excitement  and  great  expectations,  fear,
uncertainty  and  intensified  conflict.  Regionalism,  racism,  sexism  and
tribalism and all other negative features  from  the  immediate  past  still
weighed heavily upon all of us. It was in that context that we,  the  people
of South Africa, black and white, had to take a special  route  out  of  our
terrible past that entailed us  crafting  a  constitution  that  embodied  a
process that has taken us up to this point.

This was the correct approach at the time to meet the demands of a  specific
historic conjecture. Current threats to our hard-won democracy from  certain
quarters notwithstanding, we are now settling down, stabilising,  coming  to
know each other better as fellow South  Africans,  becoming  South  Africans
indeed. It cannot be therefore regarded as misguided  and  opportunistic  to
ensure that our Constitution is amended to ensure that true fluid  realities
of our society continue to be adequately reflected and accommodated.

It  is  our  responsibility  as  legislators  to  respond  effectively   and
efficiently  to  the  changing   political   landscape   by   amending   our
Constitution to further release our people from their apartheid  ideological
and political cocoons, including the hon legislators.

As society normalises, we  will  continue  to  be  called  upon  to  respond
appropriately.   A   mechanical,   historic   and   dogmatic   approach   to
constitutional matters, independent of the concrete political  realities  of
our country, can only serve to confuse rather than  clarify  the  situation.
It is to the dynamic political realities of our society that  the  ANC  will
continue to respond, and the ANC will take the  lead  in  ensuring  that  an
equally dynamic constitutional dispensation is in place.

Therefore let all well-meaning South African  patriots  accept  the  current
amendment of our Constitution. We of the great  Limpopo  endorse  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, we in the ACDP  have  consistently  opposed  the
legislation, and we feel somewhat vindicated in our view,  having  read  the
Slabbert committee report, which shares our view that at  this  time  it  is
undesirable.

It is no good the Minister arguing; the Minister is a  clever  man  who  can
turn an argument. The fact of the matter is that it's  disingenuous  of  the
Minister to say that about the court judgment. All  the  court  did  was  to
judge that it was not unconstitutional. The  court  did  not  judge  on  the
desirability of the measure at all.

The ACDP believes that we are in transition - not  that  we  have  an  ideal
system, but that whilst we are in transition, the  system  we  have  at  the
moment is appropriate.

The measure which is before the House and what  went  before  was  meant  to
contribute to political stability. That was what  it  was  meant  to  do.  I
would say that, with the benefit of hindsight, it has had the very  opposite
effect. Cape Town suffered a paralysis of government for a year or more.  In
KwaZulu-Natal, terrible  stresses  and  strains  have  been  unleashed,  and
government was destabilised by these measures. So it had the  very  opposite
effect of stabilising the political process.

Of course, on  the  question  of  the  desirability  of  floor-crossing  and
amendments, the Minister is right. The court said it was constitutional.  It
did not say it was desirable. It is instructive for us to read  the  court's
previous comments  on  the  desirability  of  the  antidefection  clause  as
expressed during the 1996 certification judgment. I will only  read  one  or
two clauses from the certification judgment. I quote:


  It prevents parties in power from enticing members ...

This is why they said an antidefection clause was necessary.  This  is  what
they said. They argued it was necessary because:


  It prevents parties in power from enticing members of  small  parties  to
  defect from the party upon whose list  they  were  elected  to  join  the
  governing party. If this were permitted, it would  enable  the  governing
  party to obtain a special majority which it might not otherwise  be  able
  to muster, which is not a reflection of the view of the electorate.

Then there are other clauses which they argue, which I am sure the  Minister
is familiar  with.  The  court  accepted  that  the  main  reasons  for  the
inclusion  of  the  antidefection  clause  was  to  secure  a  more   stable
government and to avoid corruption in legislation.

Our  Parliament  and  our  Constitution,  in  our  view,   are   not   being
strengthened  or  enriched  by  this  opportunistic   legislation.   It   is
disingenuous to argue that, somehow, a party which votes  for  a  particular
measure and then is defeated can now not  have  the  benefit  of  ...  [Time
expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I call upon the hon Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I note my name appears after Mr Naicker's on  the
speakers' list. I don't know if that is intentional.  [Interjections.]  Must
I proceed?

THE CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I suppose I was in a hurry to  go
home. I'm not well.

Mr S V NAICKER (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair,  mine  has  been  a  very  long
journey. In the early days, when anybody crossed at night, we used  to  call
them cockroaches ... [Laughter] ... but when they crossed  during  the  day,
we called them grasshoppers. Such was the politics of the yesteryear.

I just want to remind my hon friend Mr Ackermann from the  New  NP  that  we
must be very cautious when we make statements. Let  us  not  interfere  with
the rights of any political parties, be it the IFP or  the  ANC.  They  have
all the right. It is  their  prerogative  to  decide  how  best  they  think
members should be deployed.

As a result, there was that shift. [Interjections.]  Yes,  I  will  have  to
teach you. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr S V NAICKER: Madam Chair, for the information of this  Chamber,  this  is
my 23rd year in Parliament. There came a time when I decided to depart  from
my political party. What did I do? I withdrew from the political  party  and
I withdrew from Parliament.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is that a point of order?
Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Chairperson, I wanted to ask whether it is  parliamentary
for a member to give us an autobiography  instead  of  proceeding  with  the
debate. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Naicker, carry on.

Mr S V NAICKER: Perhaps  my  autobiography  is  not  palatable  to  the  hon
member! [Laughter.]

What we are saying is that I resigned from my political party  and  resigned
from Parliament. It is a matter of principle. It is a  very  relevant  issue
which we are involved in at the moment.

Let us  accept  the  circumstances  in  which  we  find  ourselves  in  this
particular country, which acquired democracy  only  about  nine  years  ago.
This particular legislation and what transpired in the last  six  months  or
so have left scars on us as far as that is concerned.

Dr E A CONROY: On a point of order, Chair: Does the  hon  member  know  what
the difference  is  between  leaving  without  saying  goodbye,  and  saying
goodbye and not leaving? [Laughter.]
The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  I  haven't  established   that   anything
specifically is out of order.

Mr S V NAICKER: That was perhaps an immature political point of order.

This Bill, I may say, is a naked attempt to subvert the will of the  people.
The idea that a one-party state is preferable to a multiparty  democracy  is
anathema to all decent South Africans.

The coalition between the ANC and the IFP was intended  to  bring  stability
and peace to the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal,  which  had  been  racked  by
political violence.

What has changed is that one of the partners,  the  ANC,  wishes  to  change
what  was  a  good  government  in  partnership,   perhaps   for   political
expediency. Surely the will of the people must triumph in the end?

We deplore the fact that after a law  has  been  declared  unconstitutional,
the  Constitution  would  be  amended  only  to  accommodate  an   expedient
political objective with no basis in national interest on public policy.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: There's a point of order. Kgoshi, let's  hear
what is out of order.

Chief M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I am rising on a point of order to find  out
if the hon member is speaking on behalf of the province,  or  on  behalf  of
the IFP, because as far as  the  minutes  and  the  mandate  are  concerned,
KwaZulu-Natal fully supports the Bill. [Interjections.] That  was  a  formal
mandate. Can we verify if he is speaking on behalf of  the  province  or  on
behalf of the IFP?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member Naicker, you are  at  liberty,  in
terms of the Rules, either to answer to the question or to  not  answer  the
question that has been posed here.

Mr S V NAICKER: I was saying that the IFP calls on the friends of  democracy
to promote multiparty democracy through the ballot box and the will  of  the
people and to prevent the consolidation of a one-party state.  There  is  no
reason  to  bring  about  this  change  to  our  electoral   system,   which
unilaterally modifies the fundamental contract between the  voters  and  the
elected representatives.

Political parties should choose  candidates  knowing  that  they  could  not
cross the floor and, therefore, the importance  of  remaining  committed  to
upholding the Constitution is of paramount importance. [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  member  Kgware,  do  let  us  give  the
speaker a chance.

The next speaker is the hon N Kondlo. Sorry, it's supposed  to  be  the  hon
Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, it seems it doesn't pay to be  generous  in  this
House and to wait your turn, because you might miss your turn. [Laughter.]

On a serious note, the hon Minister  has  covered  what  the  Bill  actually
encompasses, and such minor gaps as that might have left  have  been  filled
in by the hon Kgoshi Mokoena. However, I do need to  address  the  selective
memory of the hon member Ackermann.

I would like to remind members of this House that  there  was  once  a  lady
from the Western Cape provincial delegation by the name of Dr Van  Zyl.  She
sat in this House for such a short period of time that perhaps many  of  you
don't remember her. But she  was  passing  through  -  in  fact,  it  was  a
revolving door - and shortly thereafter she was relieved of her position  in
the New NP.

And there's another incident. We were informed on the news last  night  that
the New NP's disciplinary committee meeting for Messrs  Malatsi  and  Marais
started sitting from 8 pm last night and, we are informed,  sat  until  late
into the night, according to the news.

What is interesting is not the treatment these persons might receive at  the
hands of the New NP, but the nervousness it reveals on the part of  the  New
NP at the prospect of  losing  even  a  single  seat  in  the  Western  Cape
provincial legislature. This would transform them from being a  very  junior
partner to the ANC to becoming an irrelevant partner. It seems  that  it  is
not only in the Western Cape that they  will  potentially  lose  seats,  but
also in the Northern Cape, potentially in KwaZulu-Natal and  potentially  in
many other provinces.  [Interjections.]  I  don't  need  to  go  into  those
details. History will tell us very shortly what the position is.

But it is also interesting to note that since 1994  the  Nationalists  -  or
the New Nationalists, as they like to be called - haven't managed to  retain
or gain any single seat of power on their own. So, whether they have  to  be
new or take on any other new  appellation  or  form  an  alliance  with  the
African nationalists, it seems to me that history will really  consign  them
to the place where they ought to  be  consigned.  [Interjections.]  Just  in
closing, the DP does support this  piece  of  legislation.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Ms N C KONDLO: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  the  ANC's
position on this Bill is articulated by the following  statement  which  was
made by the ANC's president in his opening address at  our  51st  conference
in Stellenbosch. The hon member who has  just  spoken  might  remember  that
town. I quote:


  The circumstances leading to the formation and failure of the  Democratic
  Alliance, the DA, had indicated that significant numbers of  our  people,
  as well as of those they had  elected  as  public  representatives,  were
  reassessing their political positions.


  This suggested that the time had come that our democratic  system  should
  create the space for the attendant adjustments  in  our  legislatures  to
  take place.


  The approach of the ANC to this matter derives from the premise  that  we
  should allow public representatives, in cases  where  there  has  been  a
  major shift  in  political  alignment  among  constituencies  and  within
  political parties, to cross the floor without losing their seats.


  Indeed, when the country's Constitution was being  finalised,  those  who
  today cry wolf and attribute all kinds of  strange  motives  to  the  ANC
  argued for this to be allowed. In turn, we insisted that any  changes  in
  the  law  and  the  Constitution   should   prevent   destabilising   and
  unprincipled movements of people between  political  parties,  that  have
  little to do with the politics of society as a whole.


  As we progress further away from the period of apartheid,  the  political
  views of many of our people will change.  Our  legal  and  constitutional
  framework should not block this natural  political  process.  Only  those
  afraid of change because they want to cling to the mindset  of  the  past
  argue otherwise.

The objective of the  ANC  is  to  create  a  society  based  on  nonracism,
democracy and nonsexism. As such, it is the only movement which  is  capable
of galvanising and uniting behind it all forces that are committed to  these
same principles.

Yile nto ke,  Mphathiswa,  le  mibutho  yezopolitiko  mincananyana  inexhala
icinga ukuba lo Mthetho uYilwayo ulungiselela i-ANC ukuze bonke abantu  beze
kuyo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Hon Minister, that is why these small political organisations have  a  fear
that this Bill is going to attract, if not steal,  their  members  and  join
the ANC.]

It is in the history and in the  tradition  of  the  movement  to  galvanise
people behind it.

Asizi kuyinceda ke into  yokuba  abantu  abaninzi  basuke  kwaba  nomgogwana
bamaqela ezopolitiko beze kwi-ANC. Kambe wona  umthetho  awenzelwanga  ukuba
abantu basuke kwimibutho yabo beze kwi-ANC. Bangasuka nalapha  kwi-ANC  baye
kweminye imibutho. Kambe ngenxa yokwazi imbali ye-ANC, loo nto ayizi  kufane
yenzeke. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[We cannot help  that  people  resign  from  these  retrogressive  political
parties to join the ANC. The law  does  not  specifically  give  people  the
right to just leave their parties and come to the ANC. They have a right  to
leave the ANC too and join other parties. However, knowing  the  history  of
the ANC, that will not happen very easily.]

A steadfast commitment to these principles and the successes of  our  social
transformation programmes have seen the ANC steadily  increase  its  support
amongst the widest range of people, including elected members  at  national,
provincial and local levels, as well as among other parties.

The problem for many of these elected public representatives  is  that  they
are trapped in political parties that no longer  represent  their  political
views. They feel imprisoned in parties that  do  not  contribute  to  social
transformation, that do not promote nonracism or  democracy  and  nonsexism,
but instead fan flames of racial polarisation  and  negativity.  We  need  a
mechanism to give such members the opportunity to  break  ranks  with  these
retrogressive forces without losing their seats and allow  them  to  play  a
meaningful role in the further transformation of our society.

This mechanism is contained in the Bill that is currently before the  House.
I won't get into the details of how the mechanisms should operate because  I
assume that the hon members here are well versed in that.

Introducing legislation to  allow  for  crossing  of  the  floor  will  have
important ramifications for our electoral  and  parliamentary  systems  and,
ultimately, our democratic  dispensation.  The  arguments  for  making  such
provision for crossing of the floor under  our  proportional  representation
system include the following.

First, the ANC will unite  all  the  forces  that  are  committed  to  these
principles, if they cross over to it.  Second,  the  ANC  has  the  historic
responsibility to  lead  both  the  people  and  opposition  in  normalising
politics in our country. Third, for the future of democracy in our  country,
we need more parties  that  are  nonracial,  nonsexist  and  democratic.  In
actual fact, the Bill itself says that people  can  cross,  parties  can  be
formed, parties can merge: anything is possible. That is  in  the  character
and nature of democracy.

Otherwise, if this Bill were not to be effected, we  would  be  keeping  and
propping up parties that belong in the past, and that  continue  the  racial
polarisation of our society. We  should  move  from  the  premise  that  the
future of South African belongs to the goals and causes that the ANC  stands
for. It is therefore our intention to expand the hegemony of the ANC and  to
win support amongst the widest range of forces in society for these goals.

The balance of  forces  has  changed  since  the  adoption  of  the  interim
constitution. The realignment in Parliament and the provincial  legislatures
is reflective of transitions in the broader society,  as  a  result  of  our
programme of  transformation.  We  should  adopt  the  principle  under  the
current electoral system in the period of transition, so that if  there  are
major upheavals in political alignment between elections, the system  should
accommodate this and not imprison people in  their  parties,  especially  if
they no longer agree with such parties' objectives.

Ndifuna  ukuthi,  xa  ndiza  kuhlala  phantsi,  xa  iinkokeli  zale  mibutho
yezopolitiko zingawuthandi lo mthetho, mazikwenze oko zisenzela iziqu  zazo.
Maziyeke amalungu afuna inkululeko yawo ayixhamle. Kunjalonje,  ezi  nkokeli
maziyeke  ukugrogrisa   abo   bafuna   ukwahlukana   nemibutho   yazo   kuba
bengasenankolelo kwiinjongo zazo.

Kwakhona, ukuba umbutho usekelwe  kwindlela  engeyiyo,  inene  awuna  kamva,
kwaye amalungu awo nawuphi  na  umbutho  ahamba  ahambe  afikelele  kwithuba
lokwazi into oyiyo  umbutho  lowo.  Kamnandi,  nabo  babecinga  ngokukhusela
iimfuno neenjongo zabo ngabanye  kuba  beziinkokeli  zale  mibutho,  eneneni
abaliphumelelanga elo dabi  kuba  nakwiinkundla  zamatyala  lo  mthetho  umi
kakuhle.

Kwakhona,  ndiyafuna  ukuveza  ukuba  nokuba  lo  mthetho  ubungekho  okanye
ubukhona, amalungu emibutho yezopolitiko athi engengawo amalungu  ePalamente
asuke  aye  kuzimanya  namanye  amaqela  ezopolitiko.  Phaya  eMpuma  Koloni
sinomzekelo omhle wayizolo elinye.  Amalungu  angama-63  e-UDM  -  angengawo
malungu epalamente  yephondo  kodwa  amalungu  nje  -  asuka  ngemini  enye,
ngexesha elinye, ashiya i-UDM aya kuzimanya  ne-ANC.  Yintoni  enokuthintela
la alapha e-UDM  angaphumi  kwi-UDM  aze  kwi-ANC?  Kungenxa  yokuba  elapha
ePalamente enexhala lokuphulukana nezihlalo zawo?

Lo Mthetho  usaYilwayo  uqinisa  idemokhrasi  nenkululeko  yabantu  njengoko
abantu befuna. Ndiyabulela, Mhlalingaphambili.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Furthermore, I would like to say that leaders of parties that  are  opposed
to this Bill should do so of their own free will. They  should  not  try  to
stop the members that want freedom for them. These leaders  must  also  stop
threatening those that want out of their parties because they (the  members)
no longer agree with those parties' principles and objectives.  Furthermore,
if a party is based on wrong principles, I tell you,  it  does  not  have  a
future and members of any party will eventually demand to know  what  it  is
all about. It is nice to note  that  they,  too,  thought  about  protecting
their needs and objectives as leaders,  however,  they  have  not  won  that
battle because this law has been proved constitutional  even  in  courts  of
law.
I also would like to point out that this Act may not have  been  there,  but
technically  it  did  exist  in  the  sense  that   members   of   political
organisations could join other organisations while they were not members  of
Parliament. In the Eastern Cape we have a good example that  we  could  cite
of something that happened the day before last. Sixty-three members  of  the
UDM - they were not members of the provincial parliament - decided,  on  the
same day, to resign from the UDM and cross the floor to join the  ANC.  What
could stop members from the ANC from doing the same  thing?  Is  it  because
they are members of Parliament and probably fear losing their seats?

This Bill is in line with democratic principles and is going  to  strengthen
our democracy and the freedom of our people  as  they  wish.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, a point of order was raised by the hon  member
Kgoshi Mokoena, and the hon member's point was valid.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Sulliman, where are you now?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: That was when the hon member Naicker was speaking.  I  just
wanted to bring to your attention that the point of order which  was  raised
by  Kgoshi  Mokoena  was  a  valid  one  in  terms  of  our  Rules  and  the
Constitution and we would like the Chair to make a ruling  in  that  regard.
Thank you.

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF   THE   COMMITTEES:   Mnu   Sulliman   ohloniphekileyo,
besingawulibelanga loo mba. [Hon Sulliman, we have not forgotten about  that
issue.]

That was not a point of order. A ruling will be made.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Chair,  thank
you very much. I must first and foremost thank the hon members  for  what  I
think has been a very good and very interesting debate on  the  Bill  before
the House. I undertake to ensure that the question that was raised  by  both
hon Prince B Z Zulu and hon Mr  C  Ackermann  will  be  looked  into  -  the
question in regard to the situation of the  members  of  House  who  may  be
affected by floor-crossing in the provinces particularly.

Hon member Durr quite correctly summarised what  I  had  said.  I  certainly
didn't say that the Constitutional Court was called upon to adjudicate  upon
the desirability or otherwise of these laws or, in fact, of the crossing  of
the floor, because I should be credited with a bit of understanding  of  how
the system works. The court was never called upon to do  so  because  it  is
not a function of a court of law to determine the desirability or  otherwise
of a law. It just goes into  the  question  of  legality  or  constitutional
validity. That is the only function that the court was expected to perform.

The desirability or otherwise of a law or of an  amendment  is  a  political
question, really. It does not require determination by a court  of  law.  It
is left to us here. We are the ones who have to determine whether or  not  a
particular law is desirable. Once we have actually  determined  that  it  is
desirable, we then go about it correctly in terms of both manner  and  form,
in order to ensure that that which we have adjudged to be desirable is  then
indeed not adjudged to be unconstitutional further down the line.

I think the House needs to know that those who raise the  moral  question  -
who say it is immoral for any person to cross the floor with a  seat  -  and
who have raised it even now actually were beneficiaries to some extent.  The
UDM itself accepted no fewer than 11 councillors who crossed the  floor.  It
didn't, as I have said, say to them, ``No, it's immoral  for  us  to  accept
you, so please go wherever else, but don't come to the UDM.''

The IFP forgot the question of morality when it  received  nine  councillors
who crossed the floor. They are members of the IFP and  they  represent  the
IFP. They have exercised their freedom to choose. They made that choice  and
the law allowed them to choose to go to  the  IFP.  The  ACDP  accepted  two
people. It again did not  even  preach  Christian  morality  to  them  about
crossing the floor. [Laughter.]

So I am surprised that indeed this question arises now. I am  sure  that  if
they would want to raise this question, the test is coming when  the  window
of opportunity to cross is opened, and opened very  wide,  after  this  Bill
has come into effect. They should then indeed be very consistent and say  to
people, for instance, ``No, don't come to us. It is not in keeping with  the
Christian morality of the ACDP to accept you.''  [Laughter.]  Then  we  will
take them very seriously, but right now it's laughable that  they  say  this
and at the same time accept people.

That is exactly what is disingenuous: to  label  people  as  cockroaches  or
grasshoppers and call them prostitutes, and then  at  the  same  time,  when
they cross over to you, to indulge in  a  lovely  dalliance  with  them  and
forget about your own morality. [Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: We never did any of those things.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Yes. Thank you.

Mr K D S DURR: You're falsely accusing us. [Inaudible.] [Interjections.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: You never said  any
of those things?

Mr K D S DURR: No.

The   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:    Yes.
[Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Yes.  Right.
[Interjections.]

The   CHAIRPERSON   OF   COMMITTEES:   Dialogue   will   not   be   allowed.
[Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.] ... use the moral ... [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  So  indeed,  with
regard to you, the moral argument does not arise. People are free to  cross,
so support the legislation.

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: There  is  a  logic
in what you are saying now. But, you see, the last bit must also  be  placed
on record.
In 1996, during the certification process -  I  don't  know  where  the  hon
member  Mr  Naicker  was  then  -  the  IFP  argued  against  the  so-called
antidefection clause. We had a wonderful argument presented by  the  lawyers
who represented the IFP and were paid by the IFP to present  that  argument.
Now, nowhere did  they  talk  about  the  immorality  of  the  antidefection
clause. But they told the court  that  the  antidefection  clause  prevented
people from exercising the choices that  a  democracy  must  allow  them  to
make.

Now, those of us who then indeed argued that maybe at that point it was  not
desirable for people to be allowed to cross were castigated in  many  forums
for taking that stance - so much so that eventually  we  said,  ``You  know,
maybe they are right.'' Just at that point, when we began to  embrace  their
position,  they  then  swung  around  and  said  it  was  immoral.  I  can't
understand this inconsistency, really.

It is only tsotsis who say, ``Look, the principle is applicable  right  now,
and when I change my mind it doesn't apply.'' It is only in that world  that
you are allowed to be inconsistent, the world of thugs. The world of  people
who want to be taken seriously as leaders should be intolerant of that  kind
of behaviour.

Lastly - very, very lastly - the hon Naicker quite correctly said  that  the
ANC-IFP arrangement in KwaZulu-Natal in particular was put together for  the
correct purposes. We debated it at great length between our two  parties  as
well as within the ANC. I do not know whether the IFP did  that,  but  I  am
sure it did. I can imagine it did that. But some  of  the  strangest  things
started happening, and they culminated in the unceremonious sacking  of  two
MECs and their replacement with members of their new-found ally, the DA.

It's a very interesting thing.  Of  course,  because  we  believe  that  the
relationship with the IFP is in the best interests of this country,  we  did
not behave the way they did. We did not respond in  kind  at  all.  We  have
kept to that arrangement. At critical levels there are IFP members  who  are
ambassadors representing the Republic of South Africa who would  never  have
been appointed by the IFP because it is  not  the  majority  party  in  this
country.

I am not going to say more, but I am just saying that we have at least  been
consistent. Honest people will say that even when we were  going  through  a
real political storm and MECs were sacked in KwaZulu-Natal,  the  ANC  stood
firm. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As the decision is dealt  with  in  terms  of
section 74(3) of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether  all  the
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
Are all the delegation heads present?

HON MEMBERS: Yes.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: In accordance with Rule  71,  I  shall  first
allow provinces the opportunity to make their declarations of vote  if  they
so wish.

We shall now  proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  I  will  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against  or  abstain  from  voting.

     A.     INTRODUCTION
         The Portfolio Committee on Finance and the Joint  Budget  Committee
         together held hearings on the 2003/04 Budget  between  27  February
         2003  and  6  March  2003.  The   Committee   wishes   to   express
         appreciation to all participants for their  contributions.  Written
         presentations submitted form part of the records of  the  Committee
         Section. The Committee would also like to express its  appreciation
         to the Minister of Finance, the Deputy  Minister  of  Finance,  the
         Director-General of Finance, the Commissioner of the South  African
         Revenue Service,  the  Chairperson  of  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
         Commission and their staff for  their  presence  and  contributions
         during the hearings. A list containing the names of all  those  who
         made oral submissions is included in part D of this Report.


     B.     OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET


         The 2003/04 Budget was presented in the context of  South  Africa's
         relative economic resilience and  growth  in  the  face  of  global
         slowdown and uncertainty. The  expansionary  fiscal  policy  stance
         began in 2001 is continued. In line with the  2002/03  Budget,  the
         2003/04 Budget offers considerable personal income  tax  relief  to
         lower  and  middle-income  groups,  and  shows  strong  growth   in
         expenditure which focuses on the themes set out in the Medium  Term
         Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). Continuing  on  from  last  year's
         Budget, the focus areas of this Budget include  poverty  reduction,
         increased  infrastructure   investment,   broadening   the   social
         security net, strengthening access to health  and  education  while
         focusing on the quality of service delivery and  the  expansion  of
         municipal and provincial services.  Real  non-interest  expenditure
         growth of 4,5 per cent is expected over the MTEF.


         1. ECONOMIC POLICY AND OUTLOOK


              (a) International context and forecast


                  Internationally,   global    economic    conditions    are
                  unfavourable, with falling stock  markets,  weak  consumer
                  and business confidence, and sluggish output and  activity
                  indicators.


                  Despite  this  global  slowdown,   and   hardship   within
                  Southern Africa due to  drought,  shortfalls  in  regional
                  grain production and rising food  prices,  South  Africa's
                  economy is growing steadily.  Growth  and  development  is
                  expected to gather momentum in  the  years  ahead  due  to
                  initiatives to encourage investment, raise  skills  levels
                  and reduce  constraints  on  business  formation.  Further
                  gradual liberalisation of exchange control is proposed  to
                  support the further integration of South Africa  with  the
                  global economy.


              (b) GDP Growth


                  South  Africa's   growth   proved   resilient   in   2002,
                  increasing to 3 per cent. Projected  growth  for  2003  is
                  3,3 per cent, rising to 4 per cent by 2005.  A  number  of
                  factors  underpin  Treasury's  optimism:  strong  consumer
                  demand and investment spending  (investment  grew  by  6,6
                  per cent in 2002 and  is  expected  to  continue  to  grow
                  around 6 per cent a year over the medium term);  declining
                  household  debt;  formal  sector  employment  is   turning
                  around;  the  current  account  balance  is  healthy;  and
                  inflation is expected to decline in 2003 and 2004.


              (c) Interest rates


                  Following the sharp depreciation of the  currency,  rising
                  food prices and the increase in money demand in the  early
                  part of 2002, the Reserve Bank  increased  interest  rates
                  by 400 basis points in the first nine months of last  year
                  in an effort to stem second round inflationary  pressures.
                  This has assisted in moderating the inflation trend.


              (d) Inflation


                  Inflation increased sharply in 2002, with  CPIX  inflation
                  peaking at 12,7 per cent in November 2002,  with  headline
                  CPI inflation rising to 14,5 per cent in the  same  month.
                  Towards the end of 2001 the depreciation of the  Rand  put
                  upward pressure on inflation. Consumer price inflation  as
                  measured by CPIX averaged 10 per cent in 2002  and  peaked
                  at 12,7 per cent for the year to  November.  Much  of  the
                  increase was  due  to  rising  food  prices,  housing  and
                  medical costs.


                  Following the Rand's subsequent recovery,  CPIX  inflation
                  started to decline, and is set to fall within  the  target
                  range  in  2004.  The  Treasury   remains   committed   to
                  inflation targeting and stated that the  inflation  target
                  of 3 to 6 per cent will be retained for 2005.


              (e) Output and investment trends


                  Investment growth was strong across the economy  in  2002,
                  increasing by 6,3 per cent. Treasury believes  it  is  set
                  to grow by around 6 per cent over the medium term,  buoyed
                  by robust public infrastructure  spending,  several  major
                  mining projects and diversified manufacturing growth.


                  Net foreign direct investment  reached  R12,8  billion  in
                  the first three quarters of 2002.  Gradual  liberalisation
                  of  exchange  controls  continues  this  year,  supporting
                  global expansion by South African companies and  unwinding
                  of blocked assets.


              (f) The Balance of Payments and the Current Account


                  The balance of payments remains healthy. A surplus on  the
                  current account of the balance of  payments  was  recorded
                  in  2002,  despite  sluggish  global  demand   for   South
                  Africa's exports. Manufactured exports continued  to  grow
                  strongly, tourism is  booming  and  trade  performance  is
                  expected to benefit from the global recovery. With  strong
                  investment growth  and  increased  import  demand,  it  is
                  expected  that  the  current  account  will  move  into  a
                  moderate deficit of 0,5 per cent of GDP in 2003.


                  The latest data indicates net  capital  inflows  of  R21,4
                  billion for the year to September.


              (g) The Net Open Forward Position


                  Treasury has made significant  progress  in  reducing  the
                  net open forward position (NOFP) from  US$4,8  billion  at
                  the end of December 2001 to US$1,5 billion at the  end  of
                  January 2003.
              (h) Employment and productivity


                  Formal sector employment increased in 2002 for  the  first
                  time since 1996,  and  labour  productivity  continues  to
                  improve steadily, increasing the  competitiveness  of  the
                  economy  and  helping  to   stabilise   prices.   Treasury
                  announced  that  black  economic  empowerment  must   take
                  priority  over  the  next   decade.   Alongside   sectoral
                  initiatives to deepen participation in the  ownership  and
                  management of South  African  companies,  government  will
                  support  the  funding  of  new   ventures   and   business
                  expansions that meet agreed empowerment criteria.


              (i) Accountability for service delivery


                  Treasury   hopes   that   the   Estimates   of    National
                  Expenditure, together with the  publication  of  the  2003
                  Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  in  April,  will  provide
                  all 10 legislatures with  comprehensive  and  quantifiable
                  information to exercise their oversight responsibilities.


         2. FISCAL POLICY AND BUDGET FRAMEWORK


              (a) Fiscal policy trends and targets


                  Beginning  with  the  2001  Budget,  a  more  expansionary
                  stance   was   enabled   by   the   earlier   period    of
                  consolidation.  Strong  real  spending   growth   is   now
                  projected within  a  sustainable  fiscal  framework,  with
                  social spending and infrastructure  investment  increasing
                  strongly. At the same  time,  tax  relief  again  benefits
                  lower   income   households   and   encourages    targeted
                  industrial  investment.  Over  the  next  three  years,  a
                  budget  deficit  of  between  2  and  2,5  per   cent   is
                  accommodated  within  a  sustainable   framework   and   a
                  declining debt-GDP ratio, after an estimated 1,4 per  cent
                  in the current year.


                  General government capital formation is targeted  to  grow
                  by  at  least  5  per  cent  a  year,   while   government
                  consumption expenditure will stabilise  at  about  19  per
                  cent of GDP. General government tax  revenue  will  remain
                  at between 27 and 28 per cent  of  GDP,  and  interest  on
                  public debt is expected to decline from 4,9  per  cent  of
                  GDP in 2002 to 4,2 per  cent  in  2005.  A  public  sector
                  borrowing  requirement  of  2,6  per  cent   of   GDP   is
                  projected.


              (b) Revised budget framework


                  The main budget provides for expenditure of  R334  billion
                  in 2003/04, rising to R395,6 billion in  2005/06.  Revenue
                  increases from R304,5 billion to R361,2 billion  over  the
                  same period. Higher GDP growth  and  inflation  contribute
                  to substantial upward revisions in revenue  estimates  for
                  2002/03  and  the  following  three  years.  Main   budget
                  revenue is expected to be 26,6 per  cent  of  GDP  in  the
                  budget year, and to remain at that  level  over  the  next
                  three  years,  which  again  allows  for  substantial  tax
                  relief in 2003/04.


                  The budget deficit for 2002/03 is expected to be  1,4  per
                  cent  of  GDP,  mainly  due  to  robust  revenue   growth.
                  Expansion in spending planned for  the  MTEF  period  will
                  however raise the deficit to a projected 2,4 per  cent  of
                  GDP in 2003/04.


                  Debt service costs, however, are  expected  to  fall  from
                  4,2 per cent  of  GDP  in  2002/03  to  3,8  per  cent  by
                  2005/06.  National  government  debt  will  decline  to  a
                  projected 36,8 per cent by the end of the MTEF period,  in
                  contrast to its level of 48,1 per cent of GDP at  the  end
                  of 1997/98.


              (c) Fiscal policy as tool for growth and development


                  This budget framework reinforces  growth  and  development
                  partly through strong expenditure growth and  tax  relief,
                  but also through the emphasis on investment and  transfers
                  to households.


                  The Minister emphasised that growth in spending has to  be
                  accompanied by improved management  and  service  delivery
                  at  all  levels,  with  measurable   objectives   in   the
                  Estimates  of  National  Expenditure  aimed  at  improving
                  accountability  and  oversight.   Additional   allocations
                  signal a marked shift in favour  of  provinces  and  local
                  government, whose role in driving  successful  development
                  is recognised.


         3. REVENUE


              Revenue   collections   remain   buoyant,   reflecting    both
              improvements in administration and longer term benefits of tax
              policy reforms. This provides scope for  further  tax  relief,
              increased incentives for domestic investment and savings,  and
              tax  reforms  designed  to  stimulate  business   growth   and
              development. All  of  these  trends  are  in  line  with  this
              budget's expansionary stance concentrating on  employment  and
              enhanced economic development.


              (a) 2003/04 tax relief proposals


                  (i)  Direct tax measures affecting individuals


                       *     The tax threshold is raised by 11,1 per cent to
                           R30 000, so those earning less than  this  amount
                           will not  pay  personal  income  tax  next  year.
                           Income tax brackets  have  been  adjusted  across
                           the income spectrum to  provide  relief  for  all
                           income earners  and  to  compensate  for  bracket
                           creep.


                       *     Interest income exemption is raised from R6 000
                           to R10 000 for individuals below  65  years,  and
                           from R10 000 to 15 000 for individuals  65  years
                           and older.
                       *     The transfer duty threshold is  increased  from
                           R100 000  to  R140  000,  reducing  the  cost  of
                           buying property at the lower end of the market.


                       *     The tax on retirement funds is reduced from  25
                           per cent to 18 per cent once again. However,  tax
                           treatment  of  retirement   vehicles   is   under
                           comprehensive review,  with  legislative  changes
                           expected in 2004.


                  (ii) Business tax stimulus measures


                       *      Accelerated  depreciation  for  investment  in
                           designated urban areas.


                       *      Conversion  of  the  accelerated  depreciation
                           window period for  manufacturing  assets  into  a
                           permanent feature.
                       *      Comprehensive  business   asset   reinvestment
                           relief.


                       *     Losses on sale of depreciable business assets.


                       *      Accelerated  depreciation  for  research   and
                           development.


                       *     Accelerated depreciation  for  biodiesel  plant
                           and machinery.
                           Small  businesses  are  given  tax   relief   and
                           incentives in the form of  lower  tax  rates,  an
                           increased turnover limit and extra deductions  on
                           start-up expenses. Tax rules  will  be  clarified
                           in the case of start-up expenses.


                           The tax on foreign dividends is removed  where  a
                           South African taxpayer has a meaningful  interest
                           in the foreign subsidiary paying the dividend.  A
                           number of collateral changes accompany this.


                           The  list   of   public   benefit   organisations
                           eligible   for   tax-deductible   donations    is
                           expanded,  and  government  grants  are  exempted
                           from income tax.


              (b) Indirect taxes


                  Excise duties  on  alcohol  and  tobacco  products  see  a
                  general increase on all alcoholic beverages of between  10
                  and 11 per cent. Sorghum beer and sorghum  flour  are  the
                  only exceptions; these products  will  see  no  change  in
                  excise duty. Taxes on  tobacco  products  will  also  rise
                  from 11 per cent (cigarettes and pipe tobacco) to  39  per
                  cent (cigars).


                  The fuel levy increases an average of  some  4  cents  per
                  litre.


                  Other excises and  charges:  Ad  valorem  excise  duty  on
                  computers is abolished, and duties  on  lower  cost  motor
                  vehicles are adjusted for inflation.  A  levy  on  plastic
                  bags  will  be  introduced  and  some  of   the   revenues
                  collected will be earmarked for the recycling  of  plastic
                  bags. Air passenger departure tax will be adjusted  by  10
                  per cent.


              (c) Foreign exchange amnesty
                  Government has  moved  to  introduce  a  tax  and  foreign
                  exchange amnesty in order to  facilitate  repatriation  of
                  assets illegally  moved  offshore.  Government's  view  is
                  that  individuals  with  illegally  held  offshore  assets
                  increasingly  want  to  repatriate  these   assets,   both
                  because domestic and international  enforcement  targeting
                  illicit funds has increased, and because of  disappointing
                  yields of foreign markets.


                  The amnesty  will  run  for  six  months.  A  5  per  cent
                  Exchange Control one-time levy will be  enforced  for  the
                  repatriation of any foreign assets,  and  a  10  per  cent
                  Exchange Control one-time levy will  be  enforced  to  the
                  extent  that  any  foreign  assets  remain  offshore.  All
                  individuals filing for amnesty relief  are  released  from
                  all  civil  penalties  and  criminal  liabilities,  except
                  those currently under investigation, who may not file.


              (d) Measures to enhance tax administration
                  Tax  administration  is  being   enhanced   by   reforming
                  collection mechanisms, increasing the penalties  for  non-
                  compliance and introducing  an  advance  rulings  process.
                  Reforming  collection   mechanisms   include   outsourcing
                  undisputed tax debts to private  collection  agencies  and
                  making  those  responsible  for  collecting  VAT  directly
                  liable for failure to pay.


         4. ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT


              (a) Debt management strategy


                  Since 1999, debt management's  primary  aim  has  been  to
                  reduce  debt  costs   within   risk   limits.   The   debt
                  consolidation  programme  is  now  complete,   and   total
                  nominal value of outstanding illiquid government bonds  is
                  now some R2 billion, down from  R50  billion  three  years
                  ago.


                  Government has steadily increased  the  share  of  foreign
                  debt in the overall debt portfolio. The proceeds of  these
                  issues have contributed to reducing the net  open  forward
                  position (NOFP) held by  the  Reserve  Bank  from  US$23,3
                  billion in 1998 to US$1,5 billion at the  end  of  January
                  2003.


                  South African debt has  performed  well  on  international
                  and local markets.


              (b) Borrowing requirements, debt costs and total debt trends


                  In addition to financing the budget  deficit,  the  budget
                  provides  for  extraordinary  payments  of   R28   billion
                  between 2002/03 and  2005/06  to  compensate  for  forward
                  cover losses.


                  R10,2 billion is expected to be paid into  the  fiscus  in
                  2003/04 from Transnet's disposal of its  M-Cell  interest,
                  sale of Telkom shares, and  restructuring  dividends  from
                  the Central Energy Fund.


              (c) Contingent liability


                  Contingent  liability  is  provided  for,  to  deal   with
                  unexpected  eventualities  such  as  natural   and   human
                  disasters, and  to  provide  stability  to  the  financial
                  sector.


                  In 2002/03 a total of R10,5  billion  in  guarantees  were
                  provided. The Saambou liquidation includes an  outstanding
                  claim against the State for R4 billion.


              (d) Public enterprise restructuring and corporate governance


                  The Telkom listing in March 2003 is viewed  as  broadening
                  equity participation in the SA economy,  while  a  20  per
                  cent stake in M-Cell has been  bought  by  its  management
                  and staff.


                  Forthcoming projects include concessioning of  the  Durban
                  port container terminal; sale of 30 per cent of  Denel  to
                  British  Aerospace;  sale  of  30  per  cent  of   Eskom's
                  generation   business;   transformation   of   electricity
                  distribution   under   management   of   an    Electricity
                  Distribution Holding Company; sale of 51% of Western  Cape
                  Safcol  forests;  and  completion  of  sale  of   Aventura
                  resorts.


                  Cabinet has  approved  a  revised  Protocol  on  Corporate
                  Governance for public entities.


         5. MEDIUM-TERM EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES


              (a) Policy priorities and the MTEF


                  Priorities include  deepening  infrastructure  expenditure
                  by all levels of government; with  increased  emphasis  on
                  investing   in   skills;   public-private    partnerships;
                  targeting poverty  through  extending  the  child  support
                  grant, skills investment, access to education and  health,
                  land  redistribution  and  small   business   development.
                  Provision  for   increased   local   government   funding,
                  utilities user support and capacity  building  initiatives
                  stress  local  upliftment,  while  strengthening  of   the
                  social protection services (police, justice and  prisons),
                  increased    foreign     representation,     peace-keeping
                  activities and support for NEPAD are envisaged.


                  Additions to the MTEF spending plans include:


                  *     R11,0  billion  more  for  extension  of  the  child
                       support grant to children up to 14  by  2005/06,  and
                       primary school nutrition.


                  *    R38 billion more for hospital and  road  improvement,
                       medicines and school books, as well as increased  pay
                       for health care and welfare workers.


                  *    R6,5 billion more  to  extend  free  basic  services,
                       municipal infrastructure and community services.
                  *    Significant additions for courts and  police,  higher
                       education and further skills  development,  and  land
                       restitution and land reform.


                  *    Increased support for  services  to  citizens,  SARS,
                       research and technology development.


                  *    More for a growing international role,  peace-keeping
                       and NEPAD.


              (b) Consolidated expenditure by function


                  Social services account for 58,3  per  cent  of  spending,
                  and will grow rapidly in the years ahead,  mainly  because
                  of the extension of child support. Growth in the  criminal
                  justice sector is mainly service-orientated.


         6. PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE


              (a) Provincial grants and spending trends


                  The division of revenue in the 2003  Budget  shows  strong
                  increases at provincial and local level, reflecting  their
                  responsibilities for delivery.
                  The provincial  share  of  nationally  raised  revenue  is
                  projected to rise from 56 per cent in 2002/03 to 57,6  per
                  cent  in  2005/6.  The  provincial  equitable   share   is
                  increased to improve education  and  health  materials  as
                  well as personnel  pay,  social  assistance  grants,  road
                  construction  and  maintenance  and  economic  development
                  services.


              (b) Local government


                  The financing framework  for  local  government  is  under
                  review,  with  both  revenue  and  spending  issues  under
                  scrutiny. A new division of powers and  functions  between
                  local and  district  municipalities  will  be  part  of  a
                  transformation of municipal finances this year.


                  National budget transfers to municipalities will  increase
                  by  18,4  per  cent  over  the  MTEF  period.  Free  basic
                  electricity,  water  and  sanitation  services  for   poor
                  households   are   an   important    factor    in    this.
                  Infrastructure  grants  to  municipalities  and   district
                  management areas are a key  instrument  in  urban  renewal
                  and  rural  development,  and  their  rationalisation   is
                  proposed.


         7. ISSUES RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE


              Poverty alleviation: The Committee approved  of  the  measures
              taken in the Budget to alleviate poverty, as  they  felt  that
              this would support economic stability and raise  standards  of
              living. The question of how  to  ensure  that  the  vision  of
              policy makers is shared by policy implementers was posed.  The
              Minister replied that standards of delivery would be  improved
              by holding management accountable, and emphasised that  local-
              level accountability was important.  National  office  bearers
              should not be involved  in  implementing  policy  on  a  local
              level.


              Privatisation: In reply to a committee enquiry about the  drop
              in projected returns from privatisation, the Minister  pointed
              out that the current situation was quite  different  from  the
              heady dot.com period when privatisation was first mooted. This
              is not a uniquely  South  African  problem:  there  have  been
              worldwide  shifts  in  both  market  sentiment  and   business
              thinking,  which  are  reflected  in  the  modest  anticipated
              proceeds.   Further,   headlong   privatisation   can   create
              additional  problems,  as  this  is  not  an  easy  time   for
              privatising large industries.


              Growth and skills: Asked about the limits placed  on  tertiary
              sector growth by skills shortages, the Minister said that  the
              tertiary sector is indeed the  main  growth  sector  and  will
              remain so. It will run into absorption ceilings because of the
              skills  supply  constraint.  In  this   budget,   the   skills
              development fund is up to R3,5 billion from R3,3 billion,  but
              there is little suggesting that SETAS focus  on  output.  They
              have few measurable objectives for training, and it  is  wrong
              that SETAS' required outputs are as vague as at present.
              Consumer activism: In relation to the  food  price  monitoring
              programme, the Minister raised the issue of consumer activism,
              which is still weak in SA. Media  comparisons  of  prices  are
              useful. Government is not looking at price controls, but  will
              closely scrutinise retailers' behaviour.


              TRC Reparations: Asked why there  was  no  provision  for  TRC
              reparations in this budget, the Minister pointed out  that  in
              the  2001/02  Budget,  R800  million  was  allocated  to   the
              Department of Justice for reparations. Now that the litigation
              threat  has  passed,  discussion  can  go  forward  with   the
              Department  of  Justice,  since  the  R800  million  is  still
              available, plus interest.


              Black Economic Empowerment: Asked how BEE would be  delivered,
              the Minister responded that BEE was not a budgetary issue, but
              part of the economic plan. The details are  being  worked  on,
              and within three weeks the  DTI  should  announce  these.  The
              Minister said that  the  National  Empowerment  Fund  must  be
              revamped with substantially amended legislation  and  Treasury
              representatives on the board, to be used as a vehicle for BEE,
              quite different than hitherto.


              He added that he was not saying that the R10 billion allocated
              for BEE would be financed via the  foreign  exchange  amnesty,
              but that it would  be  good  if  the  levy  from  the  amnesty
              facilitates expansion of the economy. It cannot  be  the  only
              source, as the amnesty lasts six months, and  BEE  is  planned
              for at least the next five years.


              Management and delivery: The Committee was concerned that  the
              value-for-money and  performance  measures  mentioned  in  the
              Budget would not be realised. When questioned as to  how  this
              would be done, the Minister said that greater  emphasis  would
              be placed on management training, specifically  management  in
              the accounting for and planning of expenditures. If management
              were trained  and  skilled,  they  would  be  better  able  to
              implement public programmes.
     C.     RESPONSES TO THE BUDGET


         1. MACROECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES ON THE BUDGET


              Three economists made submissions to the  Committee,  focusing
              on the macroeconomic implications of the Budget. All  strongly
              endorsed the Budget and the expansionary policies it embodied,
              and stressed that there was higher private  sector  confidence
              in government's will to deliver on policy than ever before.


              (a) Sandra Gordon: Independent economist


                  Ms Gordon  noted  that  this  is  the  boldest  pro-growth
                  Budget to date, and  called  for  still  more  stimulatory
                  measures aimed  at  domestic  demand,  as  the  export-led
                  growth  strategy  comes  under  pressure  in  the  present
                  global context. She sees an increased role for the State.


                  Local growth is set to slow in 2003, due  to  the  effects
                  of high inflation and high interest  rates,  and  domestic
                  demand has declined. Although the tax cuts tabled  in  the
                  2003 Budget have addressed this to  some  extent,  further
                  oil price  increases  are  likely  to  act  as  a  tax  on
                  consumers and negate some of the benefits of tax relief.


                  Additional factors slowing growth in 2003:


                  *    Export-led growth,  so  successful  during  2002,  is
                       beginning to falter, due  in  part  to  the  stronger
                       Rand.


                  *    The global economic slowdown  is  also  cutting  into
                       export performance, with war fears  and  uncertainty,
                       and consequent higher fuel prices exacerbating this.


                  *    In the medium term, US economic recovery will  see  a
                       lower growth norm of around 2 to  2,5  per  cent;  it
                       will cease to be the global growth engine.


                  *    Positive pro-growth government policies include:


                       -      Inflation  targeting,  if   wage   and   price
                           increases can be kept within target levels.


                       -     Tax relief, which  reinforces  stability,  with
                           consumer spending less  volatile,  and  household
                           debt dropping to its lowest since 1991.


                  She noted that  there  is  a  tendency  by  government  to
                  underestimate   revenue,   which   affects   GDP   deficit
                  projections and results ultimately in a  less  stimulatory
                  Budget. Government should develop  additional  methods  to
                  manage  inflation,  supplementing   the   Reserve   Bank's
                  interest rate interventions.


                  During the period of jobless growth in  the  1990s,  South
                  Africa experienced a steady shedding of employment.  There
                  needed to be a strong focus on the capacity to deliver  on
                  expenditure.


                  Economic reforms in the 1990s have  created  a  much  more
                  resilient economy.  However,  they  also  saw  the  steady
                  shedding of employment. She acknowledged  the  success  of
                  policies in generating growth, and setting the  stage  for
                  further growth,  but  stressed  global  trends  suggest  a
                  shift of focus to  fostering  domestic  demand.  There  is
                  scope  for  an  increased   role   for   government.   New
                  stimulatory measures, notably capital expenditure,  should
                  be accelerated as capacity for delivery improves.


              (b) Prof Charles C  Okeahalam,  Chair  of  Minerva  Group  and
                  Professor at WITS


                  Prof Okeahalam's view was that the  crux  of  this  Budget
                  was the decline in sovereign debt and debt service  costs,
                  which have brought down the overall cost of capital.


                  In general he reviewed the Budget  positively,  areas  for
                  concern to be:


                  *    The household savings structure.


                  *    Uncertainty about the long-term effects of HIV/AIDS.


                  *    The ability of the supply-side to deliver.


                  The last was his major concern: he felt that  policies  to
                  stimulate the private  sector  must  not  be  expected  to
                  solve the problems of unemployment and  poverty.  However,
                  he  noted  increased  spending  on  infrastructure,   with
                  government capital expenditure projected  to  increase  to
                  23,3 per cent over the 2003/04 period, and  the  increased
                  focus on service delivery. However,  he  felt  that  there
                  had  been   insufficient   attention   to   HIV/AIDS   and
                  competition issues.


              (c) Dr Iraj Abedian, Director and  Group  Economist,  Standard
                  Bank


                  Dr Abedian's overview was strongly positive,  seeing  this
                  Budget as a  leap  forward  in  normalising  macroeconomic
                  conditions. He pointed to three major developments:


                  *     The  rising  level   of   general   confidence,   in
                       particular of the business sector in government.


                  *    The nature of the global economy in which the  Budget
                       is presented. For the  first  time  in  four  decades
                       South Africa's growth rate of 3 per cent is above the
                       global average of 2,5 per cent.


                  *     Budget  2003  is  a  leap  forward  in   normalising
                       macroeconomic conditions. He pointed to the fact that
                       disposable incomes have been rising since 1994.


                  The  increasing  resilience  of  South  Africa's   economy
                  stands on four pillars:


                  *    Reinforced  by  structural  changes,  South  Africa's
                       economic efficiency is rising. South Africa's economy
                       is no longer dominated  by  the  primary  sector.  In
                       combination,  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors'
                       share of GDP is  close  to  90  per  cent,  with  the
                       tertiary sector dominant at 66 per cent of GDP. These
                       structural changes have transformed the economy.


                  *    South Africa's export diversification is paying  off.
                       In  the  World   Economic   Forum's   competitiveness
                       rankings, South Africa is  in  now  32nd  out  of  84
                       industrial and emerging economies.
                  *    Macroeconomic stability and solid  fiscal  conditions
                       afford  predictability,  with  steady  real  GDP  and
                       rising  fixed  investment,   and   inflation   trends
                       declining.


                  *     Deepening  democracy  and  social   stability   also
                       strengthen confidence.


                  Dr Abedian stressed that  in  the  now  dominant  tertiary
                  sector, confidence was far more important  than  in  other
                  sectors. Availability of skills is  also  a  key  limiting
                  factor. He was also critical  of  SETAs  as  being  poorly
                  designed  and  failing  to  deliver.  Although   continued
                  privatisation  was   important   to   maintain   political
                  credibility, he  said,  the  government  should  pay  more
                  attention to ensuring that better competition  policy  and
                  regulations were in place in all sectors.


              (d) Major issues raised by the Committee


                  (i)  Concrete measures to improve demand


                       Ms Gordon responded that demand  within  the  economy
                       could  be  increased  through  land   redistribution,
                       public  works  programmes  -  though  these   are   a
                       temporary measure - and supporting  establishment  of
                       more   SMMEs   by   simplifying   their    regulatory
                       environment. Creating an entrepreneurial  spirit  and
                       effective learnerships in  the  workplace  were  also
                       important.


                       She stressed that she advocated broadening the growth
                       policy focus to  include  domestic  demand,  but  not
                       abandoning  export  led  growth.   Some   supply-side
                       measures   are   needed   in   the   present   global
                       uncertainties.  To  supplement  these  with  domestic
                       demand stimulus, one should look towards the  primary
                       and secondary sectors, which have greater capacity to
                       absorb less  skilled  labour.  Dr  Abedian,  however,
                       noted  that  activity  in  the  secondary  sector  is
                       different from 10 years ago, with greatly  diminished
                       labour intensity.


                       Ms Gordon added that the  business  sector  would  be
                       happy with smaller tax cuts  if  government  had  the
                       capacity  to  spend  more  to  alleviate  poverty  or
                       strengthen  SA's   growth   rate   -   stability   is
                       increasingly seen as a priority.


                 (ii)  Inflation


                       The Committee questioned whether there was a conflict
                       between  trying  to  increase  domestic  demand   and
                       containing inflation. Ms Gordon's  opinion  was  that
                       there was no conflict at present.  The  Reserve  Bank
                       should cut interest rates as soon  as  possible.  She
                       noted that the  position  of  the  Reserve  Bank  was
                       severely complicated by the present value of the Rand
                       and the threat of war, with the  possibility  of  oil
                       prices spiking at $40 per bbl.


                       Asked  how  inflation   policy   could   be   managed
                       differently, her view was  that  inflation  targeting
                       should have  been  on  hold  until  pre-privatisation
                       price increases  introduced  by  rationalisations  by
                       parastatals had been absorbed.


                       Asked  about  the  effects  of  privatisation,   Prof
                       Okeahalam replied that privatisation has value as  an
                       effective efficiency policy, but called for a  robust
                       regulatory framework.


                       Dr Abedian's view was that the main focus should  not
                       be  privatisation  per  se,  but  with  promotion  of
                       competition and an appropriate regulatory frameworks.
                       He stressed that government should not simply replace
                       a public monopoly  with  a  private  monopoly,  which
                       improves neither pricing nor delivery.


               (iii)   Cash surpluses


                       The Committee enquired about cash  surpluses  in  the
                       corporate sector due to a lack of domestic investment
                       opportunities. Ms Gordon agreed  that  they  existed,
                       but stated  that  this  was  because  of  a  lack  of
                       investment opportunities internationally as  well  as
                       in SA. Such money used  to  be  taken  offshore,  but
                       perception  of  the  international  environment   has
                       changed.


                       Ms Gordon felt that if government took the initiative
                       in  investing  in  capital  expenditure   and   these
                       projects were perceived as raising SA's growth,  then
                       the corporate sector was likely to become involved in
                       the form of public-private partnerships.


                 (iv)  Growth and the need for skills


                       The Committee raised  the  issue  of  how  government
                       could continue to  drive  tertiary  sector  expansion
                       since it is our main growth area, while at  the  same
                       time stimulating the  primary  and  secondary  sector
                       because   those   impact   more   strongly   on   the
                       unemployment problem. Dr Abedian commented that there
                       are no shortcuts in this regard. The national  skills
                       shortfall is an intergenerational problem,  requiring
                       retraining and commitment to growing existing  skills
                       as much as possible, while taking care of  those  who
                       will never gain the skills.


                       There  is  a  real  challenge  for  SETAs  to  become
                       industry-led, providing usable skills,  the  kind  of
                       training that is genuinely  demanded.  They  must  be
                       held accountable for delivery.


                       He criticised  the  new  immigration  legislation  as
                       inappropriate for  an  economy  with  a  shortage  of
                       expertise, especially since much growth  was  in  the
                       tertiary sector, which needs  skilled  professionals.
                       Saying xenophobia is costly, he estimated  that  each
                       skilled immigrant could generate four to eight jobs.


                  (v)  Black Economic Empowerment


                       Asked for views on the Budget's  BEE  measures,  Prof
                       Okeahalam responded that a number of countries have a
                       history of adopting such policies. A  common  problem
                       is that only a small number of  elites  benefit  from
                       BEE, with intended beneficiaries often not reached.


                       Dr  Abedian's  view  is  that  BEE  is  part  of  the
                       normalisation of South Africa,  and  will  take  some
                       time. The present risk is one of  maldistribution  of
                       wealth and income, making BEE  a  dangerous,  double-
                       edged sword. In general, where the tertiary sector is
                       dominant,  the  economy  is  increasingly  knowledge-
                       based, with knowledge as the major wealth creator. In
                       efforts to broaden BEE,  the  focus  must  remain  on
                       effectively increasing and dispersing  knowledge  and
                       thus wealth.


         2. BUDGET 2003/04: PERSPECTIVES ON TAX POLICY


              Representatives of the National Treasury  and  SARS  presented
              the tax proposals set  out  in  the  Budget,  outlining  their
              projected impact and setting the strategic context of  medium-
              term  tax  policy.   SARS'   compliance   strategy,   use   of
              depreciation as incentive, exchange control amnesty and  their
              effect on  taxpayers  were  discussed  at  some  length.  Prof
              Matthew Lester and Prof Pieter le Roux gave  their  respective
              views on the effectiveness  of  tax  policy  to  date  and  of
              potential policy developments.


              (a) National Treasury


                  A representative of Treasury outlined  the  background  to
                  the  present  tax  proposals,  setting  out  their  global
                  context and objectives. He noted that personal income  tax
                  (PIT) relief has been a feature  of  Budget  policy  since
                  1995, with R49 billion  given  in  relief  over  the  past
                  eight years, and  corporate  tax  having  dropped  10  per
                  cent, to 30 per cent,  since  1994.  These  rates  compare
                  favourably to the rest of the world, notably  the  EU  and
                  OECD economies.


                  He outlined the 2003/04 tax  relief  proposals  and  their
                  objectives (See Section B3 above). Direct tax  provisions,
                  general business tax stimulus measures  and  indirect  tax
                  provisions were presented and motivated. Notable  elements
                  were exemption of foreign dividends from  taxation  and  a
                  six-month amnesty period  for  repatriating  or  declaring
                  illegally exported assets.


              (b) The South African Revenue Service


                  The SARS presentation outlined  the  revenue  position  to
                  date, and the target for 2003/04:


                  *    The revised  estimate  is  R11,6  billion  above  the
                       Budget estimate - R280,1 billion compared  to  R268,5
                       billion.


                  *    For the past  six  years  SARS  has  had  collections
                       above its targets, with total additional  collections
                       at R46,8 billion.


                  *    Additional collections have assisted  in  the  reform
                       of tax rates and increased expenditure programmes.


                  *    The revenue target for 2003/04 is R310 billion.


                  SARS  unveiled  its  Compliance  Strategy,  as  based   on
                  education to create a culture of  compliance;  enforcement
                  through high visibility  and  targeted  campaigns;  and  a
                  service    culture,    focusing    on    efficiency    and
                  communication.


                  The foreign exchange amnesty was motivated as  having  low
                  penalties relative to international  standards,  and  easy
                  accessibility.


              (c) Prof Matthew Lester


                  Professor Matthew Lester of Rhodes University presented  a
                  review of the period between the 2000/01 and  the  2003/04
                  Budgets.  He  argued  that  last  year  was  a   year   of
                  consolidation, while the  coming  year  is  one  in  which
                  major legislation comes into force.


                  He reviewed in detail the following changes:


                  *    Individuals' tax position,  showing  that  payers  of
                       PIT are clear gainers over five  years,  despite  the
                       fact that a number of loopholes have been closed over
                       the period.


                  *    Elderly and retired taxpayers  he  calculates  to  be
                       entitled to R62 222 free of tax, and obliged  to  pay
                       only 14,9 per cent on  R155  000  under  the  current
                       proposals.


                  *    Corporate tax  collections  have  increased  in  real
                       terms by more than a third since 2000. Major  factors
                       are the introduction of capital gains tax (CGT),  the
                       residence-based tax system (RBT), and the disallowing
                       of  personal  service  companies,  as  well  as   the
                       increase in SARS' efficiency.


                  *    The change in residential property rules  means  that
                       individual ownership, as opposed to trust or  company
                       membership, will from this year pay far less  in  tax
                       and duties when selling property.


              (d) Prof Pieter le Roux


                  Prof Pieter le  Roux  of  UWC  presented  an  argument  in
                  favour of increasing VAT  to  21  per  cent  in  order  to
                  finance a basic income grant of R100 per person.


                  He argued that the VAT increase would bite hardest on  the
                  richest five per cent of  the  population,  despite  their
                  also receiving the BIG, allowing  a  net  benefit  to  the
                  poorest 80 per cent of the populace. He  felt  this  would
                  be  an  effective  measure  to  alleviate  poverty,  while
                  acknowledging the practical problems in implementing it.


              (e) Issues interrogated by the Committee


                  (i)  Impact of tax cuts


                       The  Committee  enquired  whether  the  Treasury   is
                       realising the desired benefits of the tax cuts  given
                       so far to taxpayers, for example  in  higher  private
                       savings or increased consumption.


                       Individual savings behaviour over the last five years
                       has  shown  improvement,  officials  indicated,   and
                       Treasury is working on a modelling exercise that  may
                       provide hard data. Meanwhile, it is difficult  to  be
                       exact as to how many changes in economic activity are
                       direct effects of tax cuts.


                       However,  over   the   past   two   years   household
                       consumption expenditure  in  South  Africa  has  been
                       robust, growing in excess of 3 per  cent  per  annum.
                       Treasury believes that the tax cuts did underpin  the
                       growth in household consumption expenditure,  because
                       the household sector has not yet been saving.


                  (ii) Value-Added Tax (VAT)


                       The Committee expressed relief that VAT had not  been
                       increased, and wanted to know if this was premised on
                       the assumption that no VAT increase  compensated  for
                       inflationary increases.


                       Treasury noted that it was loathe to tamper with VAT,
                       as this would open up a debate  which  might  not  be
                       productive. South Africa's VAT  model  is  very  much
                       designed to support the enforcement capacity of SARS.
                       Currently it  contributes  some  24-25  per  cent  to
                       overall revenue, which is the  world  average.  South
                       Africa's relatively low VAT rate of 14 per cent still
                       contributes 6,5 per cent of GDP.


                  (iii)      The foreign exchange amnesty
                       Prof Lester sparked  some  discussion  by  suggesting
                       that the amnesty might not succeed if perceived as  a
                       witch hunt. The Committee noted that all applications
                       for  amnesty  would  be  dealt  with  confidentially,
                       because this is how SARS is obliged to operate.


                       The Commissioner responded that the amnesty move  was
                       about cleaning up SARS'  history  and  its  act,  and
                       making sure that it broadens the tax  base.  It  also
                       serves to create a new kind of compliance culture  in
                       South Africa and to  ensure  that,  as  of  the  2003
                       return, SARS gets a different  set  of  figures  that
                       appear on its books, which it can then  take  forward
                       from that point.


                  (iv) Viability of BIG


                       The Committee asked whether any serious work had been
                       done on the macro-economic impact of a social  income
                       grant versus tax relief, because this seems to be  at
                       the heart of the current debate in South Africa.


                       This work, which is ongoing within Treasury, is  more
                       comprehensive  than  the  BIG  concept   because   it
                       considers the entirety of social  security  provision
                       in South Africa. However, Treasury is also guided  by
                       the need to  give  as  many  people  as  possible  an
                       opportunity to participate meaningfully  in  economic
                       activity,  guiding  them  away  from  dependence   on
                       welfare.


                       Prof le Roux argued for raising a BIG  by  increasing
                       indirect taxes, notably VAT. There  was  some  debate
                       about whether this would be harshly punitive  to  the
                       poor, a larger proportion of whose spending would  be
                       in  respect  of   VAT,   even   without   calculating
                       distribution costs, before BIG benefits reached them.
                  (v)  Urban Development Zones


                       The Committee asked whether Treasury has  focused  on
                       depreciation because it is  believed  to  be  a  more
                       effective stimulator  than  income  tax  adjustments.
                       With the urban zone depreciation provisions, Treasury
                       incentivises a specific behaviour, with  the  aim  of
                       channelling  investment   towards   declining   urban
                       centres. It is a highly targeted  approach.  Treasury
                       has clearly limited it to some 13 areas major  areas,
                       where the biggest impact can be made.


                       Prof Lester, however, noted that numerous examples of
                       targeted incentives have had unintended consequences,
                       been ineffective or even corrupting.


                  (vi) The fuel levy


                       The Committee posed questions about the impact of  an
                       increased fuel levy. Public sector transport would be
                       severely affected, and the Committee asked about  the
                       impact on long-distance commuters.


                       The Treasury replied:


                       *     The taxi  industry  has  the  oldest  stock  of
                           vehicles, mainly using  leaded  fuel,  and  these
                           would need to be upgraded. There may  be  a  time
                           lag, but taxi recapitalisation will  happen  this
                           year.


                       *     The contingency reserve of R8 billion over  the
                           next three  MTEF  years  is  available  for  taxi
                           recapitalisation, after which  taxis  would  most
                           probably be utilising diesel-powered engines.


                       *     Tax policy has taken into account incentives to
                           use  larger   vehicles   using   more   efficient
                           (diesel) fuel.


                  (vii)      Corporate tax rate


                       The Committee raised the issue of whether a reduction
                       in the corporate tax  rate  was  desirable.  Treasury
                       responded that numerous international instances  show
                       a convergence of corporate tax  rates  at  30-32  per
                       cent.


                       Treasury is unconvinced by the argument that the rate
                       should be reduced:


                       *     Instead it favours creating a stable investment
                           environment    with    attractive     accelerated
                           depreciation  allowances.   With   the   proposed
                           increased  depreciation  regime,  effective   tax
                           rates faced by companies in the first year  could
                           effectively be zero, with  subsequent  tax  rates
                           for South Africa companies being as low  as  5-15
                           per cent.


                       *     Investors, whether domestic  or  international,
                           prefer  predictability.  Where   some   countries
                           dropped  company  tax  to  unsustainable  levels,
                           only to increase it again, investors  recoiled  -
                           consistency is investor-friendly.


                       *     There is a also a premium  willingly  paid  for
                           the business environment:  South  Africa  has  an
                           excellent  banking  regulatory  environment   and
                           profit opportunities relative to  the  developing
                           world.


                       Prof Lester also took the view that lower company tax
                       was not the biggest drawcard for investment. He  felt
                       that investors are not scared away by taxes  as  much
                       as by the economic climate of a country.


                  (viii)     Revenue estimates and increased collections


                       The  Committee  enquired  whether  South  Africa  has
                       reached a plateau in the rising trend of its  revenue
                       collections. SARS believes not, noting that  some  48
                       hours after  the  amnesty  provision  was  announced,
                       almost  R3  billion  was  already   on   the   table,
                       indicating a significant amount of  unreported  money
                       still extant.


                       The Tax Gap Project has  given  SARS  a  much  better
                       understanding  of  where  the  revenue   leaks   are,
                       enabling a more  targeted  approach  this  year.  The
                       Commissioner responded that SARS does hold a view  on
                       the actual quantum of the tax gap, loosely estimating
                       it at R30 billion.
                       The Committee asked why  SARS  continued  to  have  a
                       problem with overruns on its revenue  estimates.  The
                       Commissioner  replied  that  it  was   due   to   the
                       unpredictability of economic  endeavour,  citing  the
                       effects of unexpected inflation, fuel, the  resources
                       sector and war on 2002's estimates.


                       While forecasting of corporate tax is most  difficult
                       because of all the external factors impacting on  it,
                       Treasury believes that South Africa has a good record
                       when it comes to indirect taxes, and  in  many  cases
                       South Africa is out R30 million on a tax base of  R16
                       billion.


                  (ix) Ringfencing of secondary trade losses


                       The Committee raised a number of points and  concerns
                       about the ringfencing of secondary trade losses,  and
                       asked if this would  not  unfairly  penalise  certain
                       taxpayers who  have  a  legitimate  secondary  trade,
                       notably in agriculture.


                       SARS emphasised that the proposed  legislation  would
                       not impact on someone  who  is  in  the  business  of
                       farming, but would impact on someone who  is  in  the
                       secondary business of farming. In  the  second  case,
                       SARS argues, they could use tax  write-offs  unfairly
                       to compete with people who not able  to  exploit  the
                       tax system. The fiscus was being undermined by people
                       who used secondary trade tax for a tax write-off.  It
                       was  these  people  who  were  the  target   of   the
                       ringfencing.


                  (x)  Complexity and coherence of the tax system


                       The Committee asked for comment on how  coherent  the
                       tax system is as  a  macroeconomic  instrument.  Prof
                       Lester's view was  that  SARS  had  never  worked  as
                       effectively as  now,  to  the  extent  of  generating
                       taxpayer paranoia and terror.


                       Asked  whether  the  system  was  over-complex,  Prof
                       Lester noted that he was not sure that the law  could
                       be simplified.  By  international  standards,  it  is
                       relatively simple. It had increased in complexity  in
                       order to align itself with  international  standards.
                       The cost of compliance on  the  government  side  has
                       shown a positive return, but has become  much  harder
                       for businesses - an unfortunate effect of the use  of
                       best practice.


         3. SUBMISSIONS BY ORGANISED BUSINESS AND LABOUR


              (a) The Black Business Council (BBC)


                  The BBC was represented by Ms Futhi Mtoba  of  Deloitte  &
                  Touche,  Mr  Mandla   Maleka,   Chief   Economist:   Eskom
                  Treasury, and Mr Veli Ntombela, Director  Taxation:  Sizwe
                  Ntsaluba.


                  The  BBC  broadly  endorsed   the   Budget,   specifically
                  referring  to  the  child  support   grant,   government's
                  position on inflation targeting,  relaxation  of  exchange
                  controls and the proposed amnesty and the 4%  increase  in
                  government  consumption.  A   major   element   of   their
                  presentation involved SMME-friendly proposals to be  taken
                  into account in the 2004/05 budget.


                  (i)  Small business support measures
                       The BBC felt  that  the  tax  dispensation  of  SMMEs
                       requires review, specifically:


                       *     Redefinition of "small business" in the  Income
                           Tax Act, as the BBC felt this was too narrow.
                       *      Further  simplification  of   tax   compliance
                           requirements.


                       *     Further extension of the turnover ceiling.


                       The accelerated  depreciation  provisions  for  urban
                       development areas would help small business in  these
                       areas. It went on to  call  for  extension  of  these
                       concessions to other sectors, such as tourism.


                  (ii) Black Economic Empowerment


                       The BBC believes that the proposed  R10  billion  BEE
                       support funding will  foster  economic  participation
                       for the deprived sector of  the  economy.  It  awaits
                       details of the funding strategy, and  requested  that
                       it be consulted on the process of disbursement.


                       The moves to promote corporate reorganisation  should
                       include BEE transactions, and the BBC proposed:


                       *     A shareholding test of at least  50%  (and  not
                           75%) for BEE companies.


                       *     That inclusion of community trusts should  also
                           be considered.


                  (iii)      Poverty relief and social support


                       The BBC appreciated  the  increase  in  transfers  to
                       pensioners and disabled people. It  put  forward  the
                       following proposals:


                       *     Reducing the pensionable age for women  by  2-5
                           years (from 60).
                       *      Next  year's  tax  bracket  adjustment  should
                           concentrate on lower  earners,  enabling  savings
                           from this to support a lower pensionable age  for
                           women.


                       *     Rather than considering increasing the eligible
                           age for child support grants above 14 years in  a
                           future MTEF, equivalent funding should rather  be
                           allocated to ensure  that  primary  education  is
                           genuinely free.


              (b) Die Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut (AHI)


                  Mr Jac Laubscher (Chief Economist: Sanlam)  and  Ms  Anne-
                  Marie Wiehahn (Sasol Economist) presented  Die  Afrikaanse
                  Handelsinstituut's (AHI) submission to the Committee.


                  The AHI feels that  the  Budget  enhances  South  Africa's
                  appeal to international investment  through  the  proposed
                  urban  areas  depreciation  allowances;  exchange  control
                  relaxation;  the   strong   increase   in   infrastructure
                  expenditure; and increased spending on policing.


                  The AHI foresees that:


                  *    Inflationary pressure could come from an increase  in
                       the government wage bill and  a  pickup  in  domestic
                       demand.


                  *    A short-term depreciation of  the  Rand  will  follow
                       exchange   control   relaxation,   with   medium-term
                       stabilisation. An  IMF  study  suggested  an  optimal
                       value of the Rand at R8,80 to the US Dollar.


              (c) South African Chamber of Business (SACOB)


                  Karl Muller,  Des  Kruger,  John  Lewis  and  Adv  Meiring
                  presented on behalf of SACOB.


                  SACOB called for simplification  of  the  tax  system  and
                  reduction of the administrative burden  on  taxpayers.  It
                  asked for a familiarisation period for business people  to
                  implement   tax   regime   changes,   and   clarify    new
                  developments in  foreign  dividend  taxation  and  capital
                  gains tax.


                  Some upward pressure on inflation is  expected  from  this
                  Budget's tax relief measures,  but  SACOB  emphasised  the
                  negative  impact  on  price  stability  of  large   public
                  enterprises' annual tariff increases.


                  Recommendations and representations by SACOB included:


                  *     The  present  depreciation  allowance  discriminates
                       between suppliers  of  goods  on  the  one  hand  and
                       services on the other. SACOB proposes  that  this  be
                       equalised.


                  *     Adjustments  to  personal  income  tax   effectively
                       offset  bracket  creep,  and  this  should  become  a
                       standard policy for the national budget.
                  *    SACOB called for further increase in the  expenditure
                       on transport infrastructure, to promote international
                       competitiveness.


                  *    SACOB questioned  SARS'  decision  to  regulate  "tax
                       practitioners" and to clamp down on tax avoidance, as
                       minimising one's tax burden was well within the  law,
                       and  taxpayers  should  be  allowed  to  employ   the
                       services of advisors not linked to the  SARS  in  any
                       way.


                  *    On ringfencing  of  secondary  trades,  SACOB  argued
                       that owners of a legitimate second business would  be
                       penalised for the sins of a few. It  added  that  the
                       distinction under tax law is usually  between  active
                       and passive incomes, and not the different sources of
                       income.


              (d) Federation of Unions of South Africa (FEDUSA)


                  Ms  Gretchen  Humphries  (FEDUSA  Parliamentary   Officer)
                  presented the submission.


                  FEDUSA raised concerns about the trend of unemployment  in
                  South Africa. It welcomed  increased  social  spending  by
                  the  State,  seeing  this  as  a  vehicle  for   increased
                  development, especially where it is labour-intensive.


                  FEDUSA feels that the Budget did  not  adequately  address
                  HIV/AIDS, and feels that greater provision should be  made
                  to fund the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.


                  FEDUSA recommends:


                  *    That a detailed and specific budget be  outlined  for
                       HIV/AIDS treatment/prevention.


                  *    Intensification of HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns.


                  *     That  Government  should   implement   a   treatment
                       strategy  outlining   the   availability   of   anti-
                       retrovirals.


                  *    That funds should be specifically allocated  for  the
                       empowerment of Health  Care  Professionals,  for  the
                       training  of  lay  counsellors  and   for   community
                       upliftment programmes.


                  *    A legislative  framework  should  be  established  by
                       Government to  ensure  all  employers  negotiate  and
                       adopt workplace policies on HIV/AIDS.


              (e) Focus areas of discussion in Committee


                  (i)  Support for SMMEs and BEE


                       The Committee focused on the issue of  SMME  support,
                       endorsing the fact that the BBC put forward proposals
                       for future budgetary policy, and the extension of the
                       legal definition of SMMEs, and enquired about further
                       action to remove obstacles here.
                       The BBC is investigating a number of legal and  other
                       changes  that  will  increase  SMMEs'  success  rate,
                       feeling the economic environment opens  opportunities
                       for employment creation.


                       The BBC also said it  was  preparing  submissions  to
                       SARS on the problems that SMMEs have with paying VAT,
                       since the current lump sum affects their liquidity.


                  (ii) Women's pensions


                       The Committee queried the constitutional implications
                       of reducing the pensionable age for  women  only.  An
                       additional concern was  whether  it  would  have  the
                       effect of shortening women's careers, which generally
                       start later than men's. The BBC  responded  that  the
                       retirement age for men is 65 and for women is 60,  an
                       existing  differential.  In  South  Africa's   unique
                       circumstances it could be an  effective  addition  to
                       social spending.


                       He added that to  stimulate  savings  the  government
                       would have to allow for more disposable income.


                  (iii)      Skills levy


                       Responding to a request for feedback  on  the  skills
                       levy, the BBC said it found that not very many people
                       are making use of it. Part of the problem was lack of
                       public awareness, due to a lack  of  information  and
                       education on the levy.


                  (iv) Targeted child benefits


                       On the BBC's proposal not to extend the child support
                       grant to children over 14, but instead use the  money
                       for free primary education, the BBC said in  response
                       to a question that their motivation was that intended
                       beneficiaries often are not the  ones  receiving  the
                       benefits. Ensuring free schooling would be one method
                       of ensuring that the funding  reaches  those  it  was
                       intended for.
