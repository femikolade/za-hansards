                      STRATEGY TO FIGHT AIDS IN PRISONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr D V BLOEM  (ANC):  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  ek  wil  die  Departement  van
Korrektiewe Dienste  gelukwens  met  die  wyse  waarop  hulle  met  HIV/Vigs
strategie implementeer, ten einde te verseker dat personeel in  gevangenisse
opgelei is en  ingelig  word  oor  hierdie  baie  belangrike  en  sensitiewe
aangeleentheid.

Dit is ook prysenswaardig  dat  die  departement  hierdie  saak  nie  alleen
hanteer nie, maar in vennootskap met  nie-regeringsorganisasies  om  hierdie
strategie te implementeer. Daar word met waardering kennis  geneem  van  die
goeie werk wat Khulisa doen om die jeug  tussen  die  ouderdomme  van  18-25
jaar op te lei en kundig te maak oor Vigs. HOPE Worldwide lei gevangenes  in
Johannesburg  Gevangenis  op  in  die  lekeberading  en  die  hantering   en
versorging van terminaalsieke gevangenes en die Planned  Parent  Association
wat  besig  is  om  'n  beradingsprogram  vir  gevangenes   in   Durban   te
implementeer.

Ons ondersteun die departement ten volle met hierdie goeie werk as deel  van
die rolspelers in die stryd om Vigs in ons land te bekamp.  Ons  wens  hulle
sterkte toe met hierdie groot  taak  en  vertrou  dat  hulle  sal  ...  [Tyd
verstreke.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr D V BLOEM (ANC): Mr Chairman, I wish to congratulate the  Department  of
Correctional Services  on  the  way  in  which  they  are  implementing  the
HIV/Aids strategy so as to ensure that staff  in  prisons  are  trained  and
informed about this very important and sensitive matter.

It is also commendable that  the  department  is  not  handling  this  issue
alone,   but   is   implementing   this   strategy   in   partnership   with
nongovernmental organisations. One notes with  appreciation  the  good  work
that Khulisa is doing to train and inform the youth between the ages  of  18
and  25  years  about  Aids.  HOPE  Worldwide  is  training   prisoners   in
Johannesburg Prison  in  lay  counselling  and  the  handling  and  care  of
terminally  ill  prisoners,  and   the   Planned   Parent   Association   is
implementing a counselling programme for prisoners in Durban.

We fully support the department with this good work  as  one  of  the  role-
players in the battle to combat Aids in our country. We wish them well  with
this great task and trust that they ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]
     ARMS DEAL AND ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT OF DEPUTY PRESIDENT IN CORRUPTION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W J SEREMANE (DA): Chairperson, in the light of the turmoil that  exists,
I  suggest  that  President  Mbeki  should  use  the  opportunity   of   the
President's question time in this House tomorrow to  break  his  silence  on
the arms deal and Deputy President Jacob Zuma's  alleged  role  in  possible
corruption.

The President has  remained  disturbingly  silent.  The  investigation  into
alleged corruption in the arms deal has degenerated into an acrimonious  no-
holds-barred fight between factions within the ruling party - the Zuma  camp
versus the supporters of the National Director of Public Prosecutions.

In order to  restore  faith  in  his  Government,  the  President,  tomorrow
should, amongst other things, acknowledge that it would be appropriate  that
the Deputy President steps down until or unless he clears his name. This  is
also consistent with the case  of  the  former  Deputy  Minister  of  Social
Development, David  Malatsi.  He  should  express  full  confidence  in  the
National Director of Public Prosecutions; reaffirm the independence of  this
constitutionally  entrenched  institution;  and  welcome,  not   discourage,
further interrogation of the arms deal. I thank you. [Applause.]

                         FIFTH WORLD PARKS CONGRESS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs L R MBUYAZI (IFP): Chairperson, today is the  final  day  of  the  Fifth
World Parks Congress. This is the first time  a  World  Parks  Congress  has
been held in Africa.

The congress, which is a ten-yearly event, has been held in  Durban  from  8
September. It provides a major global forum  that  sets  an  agenda  on  the
management of protected areas.

The theme of the  2003  congress  is  ``Benefits  Beyond  Boundaries''.  The
congress is of great importance as it offers an opportunity  to  take  stock
of protected areas as well as chart the course for protected areas over  the
next decade and beyond.

The fact that the congress is being held  in  Africa  will,  hopefully,  put
African parks in the international spotlight and  provide  them  with  much-
needed support. We, therefore, welcome the recommendations of  the  congress
that the international community  should  provide  financial  and  technical
help for Africa's protected areas. I thank you.

       CONCERNS OVER CONTINUED MILITARY OCCUPATION OF PALESTINIAN LAND

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M RAMGOBIN (ANC): Mr Chairperson, the ANC notes  with  deep  concern  the
tense situation in the Middle East which arises from the continued  military
occupation - of unprecedented duration and which has  lasted  for  36  years
since the end of the war in 1967 - of  Palestinian  land  by  the  state  of
Israel; and, the provocative actions of  Israeli  authorities  who  launched
military incursions into the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the  course  of
Wednesday, 10 September, and physically occupied the Ministry of Culture  of
the Palestinian National Authority.

The inflammatory and  unprecedented  decision  of  the  Israeli  cabinet  to
deport or otherwise remove President Yasser Arafat from the  West  Bank,  is
another reckless step that derails peace processes in that region.

The ANC joins the international community in condemning,  unreservedly,  the
actions of the Israeli government, particularly the  threats  pronounced  by
its highest office against the person and life of President  Yasser  Arafat;
and, urges both parties to stick to the UN resolution to pursue the goal  of
peace and the immediate recognition of and respect for  the  sovereignty  of
the independent state of Palestine. I thank you very much.

                    CLOSURE OF THE DAILY NEWS IN ZIMBABWE
                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C JOHNSON (New NP): Chairperson, the New  NP  believes  that  the  forced
closure of Zimbabwe's only independent newspaper, The  Daily  News,  amounts
to yet another  human  rights  violation  in  Zimbabwe.  Press  freedom  and
freedom of speech are fundamental rights, all the more so in Zimbabwe  where
newspapers are supposed to be registered with the media commission which  is
government-run. The New NP further notes with concern  that  the  police  in
Zimbabwe have allegedly raided the offices of the newspaper and  confiscated
their equipment.

The New NP believes  that  the  forced  closure  of  The  Daily  News  is  a
contravention of many international instruments which guarantee  freedom  of
speech and  freedom  of  the  press.  It  contravenes  the  African  Union's
founding act, it flies in the face of Nepad  and  makes  a  mockery  of  the
African Charter of people's and human rights.

The New NP calls on all signatories of  these  international  agreements  to
urge for the paper's reopening. The  New  NP  further  calls  on  the  South
African Government to place the issue of press freedom on the  agenda  as  a
matter for urgent discussion at the upcoming Commonwealth Summit to be  held
in Nigeria.

                   GANG RAPE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N  C  NKABINDE  (UDM):  Chairperson,  the  UDM  expresses  shock  at  the
allegations of a gang rape which occurred  at  the  University  of  Pretoria
students residence. If there is any evidence  of  premeditated  planning  to
target, deceive, drug and abuse this  young  girl,  and  at  the  same  time
ensure that the event  is  photographed,  then  the  alleged  offenders  are
nothing but predators who deserve no leniency before the courts.

Several criminal incidents in the past month  at  institutions  of  tertiary
education across the country have been of great  concern.  Assaults,  sexual
abuse and even riots involving resident students contradict the  rights  and
principles enshrined in our Constitution. It  also  reflects  badly  on  the
youth whom we expect to lead this country to a more equal and just future.

Incidents of this nature are completely  unacceptable  in  a  country  where
only a small percentage of the youth get  an  opportunity  to  study  beyond
matric. It is sad that some students  waste  this  opportunity  and  opt  to
engage in criminal activities. We call upon all students to show  leadership
and integrity by exposing those among  them  who  bring  their  institutions
into disrepute and squander the opportunities that so  many  of  their  less
fortunate peers can only dream of. I thank you.

        CRIME AT TSHOLOFELO MANGOPE SCHOOL IN THE NORTH WEST PROVINCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms P K MOTHOAGAE (ANC): Chairperson, as the ANC, we  note  the  unacceptably
high level of burglaries and thefts experienced by the school  community  of
Tsholofelo Mangope Middle School in the Lehurutshe  township  in  the  North
West province.

We further note marches and  the  vigilante  action  of  both  learners  and
educators in tracing and retrieving school equipment allegedly  stolen  from
their school. We believe that the  establishment  of  a  community  policing
forum in the area will ensure that the scourge of crime  is  nipped  in  the
bud. We call for the  intervention  by  the  area  commissioner  to  restore
public confidence in the Police  Service  and  improve  relations  with  the
community.

                    EXPENSIVE FUNERALS AMONG POOR PEOPLE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr M S MOGOBA (PAC): Chairperson, The Sunday Times of 31 August 2003  had  a
telling headline. It said, and I quote "Funerals spell  financial  suicide".
The article analyses the disconcerting trend of poor people  buying  caskets
worth about R19 750, hiring toilets and buses and then throwing a feast  for
the mourners.

The South African Council of Churches observed that funerals are the  single
greatest  drain  on  savings  for  township  families  and  that  low-income
families under pressure  to  show  love  and  respect  for  departed  family
members choke themselves. People who can barely afford groceries go out  and
spend up to R18 000 on a casket. This is  a  serious  moral  question  which
challenges church, political and financial leaders of the nation.

The present trend of semi-state funerals  for  everybody  sets  a  dangerous
precedent for the nation. It  promotes  a  lifestyle  which  is  unwise  and
unaffordable to the majority of our people and  has  the  capacity  to  ruin
families and the nation financially.

                      HOUSING PROJECT IN NORTHERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)
Ms E NGALEKA (ANC): Chairperson, in line with  the  commitment  of  the  ANC
government to reconstruct and develop our country, an amount of R22  million
has been set aside for a housing project  at  Platfontein  in  the  Northern
Cape. What makes  this  a  remarkable  project  is  that  the  !Xu  and  Kwe
communities will not only be integrated as one community, but will be  proud
house owners. The integration of these communities will  hopefully  solidify
the preservation of the San culture and encourage unity in diversity.

Equally important is the fact that the project will allow for  job  creation
opportunities amongst the unemployed in the area. A further  important  step
taken with the integration of the  !Xu  and  Kwe  communities  is  a  social
management plan which will ensure that the  communities  successfully  adapt
to their new environment. There will be  monitoring  of  the  community  for
three months to ensure that they are well settled.

This is only one of many projects of the ANC government to  restore  dignity
and push back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

                HARDSHIPS EXPERIENCED BY FISHING COMMUNITIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs P DE LILLE (ID): Chairperson, I would like to bring to the attention  of
the House the hardships experienced by the  fishing  communities  along  the
coastline of South Africa.

Traditional fisherpeople have been deprived of earning a  livelihood,  which
they have been engaged in for centuries. Thousand of fishing  families  have
been left destitute. They have no money to pay for food,  rent,  electricity
and school fees.

Numerous appeals for help to the Western Cape  MEC  for  Social  Development
have fallen on  deaf  ears.  I  myself  have  written  two  letters  to  him
outlining the extent of  the  crisis,  and  he  has  not  even  bothered  to
respond.  Coastal  communities  throughout  the   province   are   starving,
including Kalk Bay,  Hout  Bay,  Ocean  View,  Velddrif,  Brittaniabaai,  St
Helena,    Laaiplek,    Paternoster,    Stilbaai,    Saldanha,    Stompneus,
Vermaaklikheid, Witsand, Mosselbaai en Gansbaai. Besides these Western  Cape
communities,  there  are  also  fishing  communities  in  Durban   who   are
experiencing the same hardships.

I find it bewildering that a plan was not  formulated  in  advance  to  deal
with the social crisis. It is one thing for  the  Government  to  take  away
people's  livelihood,  but  not  providing  them  with  a  form  of   social
assistance is completely unjust.

I have therefore helped  the  communities  to  set  up  a  line  fishermen's
relieve fund. I appeal to all people to donate to this  fund,  so  that  the
thousands of families along both coastlines can be fed.

We are dealing with a crisis and this Government seems  intent  on  allowing
the people to starve. I will not allow that to  happen.  [Interjections.]  I
therefore call on Minister Valli Moosa to grant exemptions to  all  handline
and small-net fishermen, so that they can at  least  fish  and  provide  for
their families ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mrs P DE LILLE: ... while there is  all  this  mess  that  has  been  caused
through this rights allocation process. Thank you. [Interjections.]

         NEW NP'S SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION ON SCHOOL GOVERNING BODIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr W P DOMAN (DA): Voorsitter, die skokkende optrede van die  Nuwe  NP  wat
gister ten gunste van wetgewing gestem het om streng regulering toe  te  pas
op skoolbeheerliggame indien hulle onderwysers met skaars kwalifikasies,  of
vir ekstra uitstaande diens, wil vergoed, sal die  kieserskorps  finaal  van
die Nuwe NP vervreem. Die Nuwe NP se leë lippediens om  vir  die  regte  van
beheerliggame te veg, sal niemand oortuig nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Deur vir elke subklousule te stem in die komitee en deur die wetgewing  goed
te praat, het die Nuwe NP  sy  gewig  ten  volle  by  die  ANC  ingegooi  om
kwaliteitsonderwys verder af te breek. Die Nuwe NP het  einde  verlede  jaar
nog teen wetgewing gestem wat beheerliggame se magte aangetas het, maar  dit
is duidelik dat die Nuwe NP nou só verbind is aan die ANC  dat  die  gehalte
van onderwys gerieflik op die altaar geplaas word.

Die DA sal voortgaan om te veg vir die regte van onderwysers,  beheerliggame
en ouers, en bedank laasgenoemde vir die groot  finansiële  opofferinge  wat
gemaak  word  om  gehalte  onderwys  te  verseker;  terwyl  die  staat   die
geleentheid gebied word om, soos ons dit graag sal wil sien,  sy  beskikbare
bronne, danksy  hierdie  ouerhulp,  aan  te  wend  om  sukkelende  skole  te
bemagtig. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN (DA): Chairperson, the  shocking  behaviour  of  the  New  NP,
which yesterday voted in favour of legislation to enforce strict  regulation
of school governing bodies if they want to remunerate teachers  with  scarce
qualifications, or  for  exceptionally  outstanding  service,  will  finally
alienate the electorate from the New NP. The  New  NP's  empty  lip  service
about fighting for the rights of governing bodies will not convince  anyone.
[Interjections.]

By voting for  every  subclause  in  the  committee  and  by  condoning  the
legislation, the New NP has thrown its weight completely behind the  ANC  to
break down quality education even further. At the end of last year  the  New
NP still  voted  against  legislation  which  tampered  with  the  power  of
governing bodies, but it is clear that the New NP is  now  so  committed  to
the ANC that the quality of education has conveniently been sacrificed.

The DA will continue to fight for the rights of teachers,  governing  bodies
and parents,  and  we  thank  the  lastmentioned  for  the  great  financial
sacrifices that they are making  to  ensure  quality  education;  while  the
state is being given the opportunity, as we would like to  see  it,  to  use
its available resources, thanks to  the  assistance  of  these  parents,  to
empower struggling schools. [Interjections.]]

                               HIV/AIDS SURVEY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Chairperson, the antenatal survey on  HIV/Aids  which
has just been  released  comes  to  us  11  months  after  the  event,  with
information one year out of date. Other  statistics,  quoted  regularly,  on
HIV are between two and four years old. This indicates that mechanisms  used
by Government to track the progress of HIV  are  inadequate.  They  are  not
sufficiently transparent, nor are they sufficiently comprehensive.

The facts contained in this survey are disturbing  in  themselves,  such  as
the estimated 4,7 million South Africans living with HIV in  2001,  of  whom
189 000 were babies who live an  average  of  two  and  a  half  years;  the
increased incidence of HIV/Aids in women between 25 and 35 years  and  above
40 years; the higher incidence of syphilis; the 91 000 babies - that  is  9%
of all births - infected with HIV via mother-to-child transmission in  2001;
and the rapid increase in the incidence of HIV in the Western Cape  to  more
than 10%.

But a chilling aspect of the survey is its narrowness,  involving  only  396
sites, using only pregnant women and the fact that,  of  the  16  587  women
tested, most were not informed of their status  nor  did  they  receive  any
treatment.

The data brings into question Government's current approach  and  calls  for
greater transparency with results; why the need for  testing;  the  need  to
inform those tested of their HIV status; and the need to treat all of  those
tested, at least for STDs ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired!
Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): ... with nevirapine and, if possible,  to  follow  up
with antiretrovirals. Thank you.

               CRIMINAL VICTIMISATION OF TEACHERS IN LADYSMITH

                            (Members's Statement)

Nk P N MNANDI (ANC): Sihlalo  wosihlalo,  imibiko  yokuhlukunyezwa  kothisha
eMnambithi  kwaZulu-Natali  isiphethe   kabi   kakhulu   thina   singumbutho
kaKhongolose. Kubikwa ukuthi othisha  baseZimisele,  eVikinduku,  kwaNodada,
eShangela, eNtshele kanye naseNgoza sebeze banquma ukungayi  ezikoleni  kuze
kuxazululwe  izinkinga  eziphathelene  nokuphucwa  kwabo   omakhalekhikhini,
ubucwebe, imali kanye nokunye okubalulekile.

Okuxakayo-ke  ukuthi  lezi  zehlo  zibikiwe  emNyangweni   weMfundo   oholwa
uNgqongqoshe we-IFP kulesi sifundazwe, kepha akunazinyathelo ezithathiwe.

Singumbutho  kaKhongolose  sithi  oNgqongqoshe  be-IFP  kulesi   sifundazwe,
kwezemFundo   nakwezokuPhepha,   mabasukume   balungise    lezi    zinkinga,
ikakhulukazi  ngoba  nabantwana  sekusondele  isikhathi  sokuthi   bahlolwe.
Sinxusa umphakathi ukuthi  ubambisane  nabomthetho  kuliwe  nalesi  sihlava.
Ngiyabonga. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu member’s statement follows.)

[Ms P N MNANDI (ANC): Chairperson, we as the ANC are very worried about  the
report that teachers are being victimised in Mnambithi in KwaZulu-Natal.  It
is reported  that  teachers  at  Zimisele,  Vikinduku,  KwaNdoda,  Shangela,
Ntshele and Ngoza have decided not to go to  school  until  the  problem  of
their  being  robbed  of  their  cellphones,  jewellery,  money  and   other
important assets, is resolved.

The problem  is  that  these  incidents  were  reported  to  the  provincial
Department of Education, led by the IFP Minister in that  province,  but  no
steps have been taken so far.

As the ANC, we say the IFP Ministers  in  this  province,  the  Minister  of
Education and the Minister of Safety,  should  stand  up  and  rectify  this
situation, especially because examination time is on  the  horizon  for  the
children. We ask the community to work together with the police in  fighting
this disease. Thank you. [Applause.]]

              RELEASE OF TERMINALLY ILL PRISONERS FROM PRISONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Chairperson, before I start my statement I  just  need
to welcome the hon De Lille back to Parliament after such  a  long  absence.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

Let the House note that Judge Fagan has echoed the call of the New  NP  that
terminally ill prisoners be released on parole. This will save the  taxpayer
millions of rands and assist the  Department  of  Correctional  Services  in
dealing with the problem of overcrowding in  our  prisons.  Overcrowding  is
costing the state R18 million a day.

While our prisons are overcrowded,  no  effective  rehabilitation  can  take
place. This also  creates  a  situation  in  which  petty  criminals  become
hardened violent criminals. Once they  are  released,  they  commit  violent
crimes, and innocent citizens become their  victims.  Correctional  officers
can monitor terminally ill prisoners with the  assistance  of  a  system  of
electronic tagging. This will  ensure  that  they  pose  no  threat  to  the
community.

There has been a drastic increase in the number of terminally  ill  patients
in our prisons over the past  years.  Many  of  them  are  HIV-positive  and
suffering from full-blown Aids. The conditions inside prisons contribute  to
the progression of  HIV  and  the  onset  of  Aids  and  death.  It  is  the
Department of Correctional  Services'  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the
rights of HIV-negative prisoners are also protected. I thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are there any  ministerial  responses?
Hon Ministers, do you want to respond to any of the  statements?  I  am  not
sure whether the Minister of Education is paying  attention.  Hon  Minister,
do you want to respond to any of the statements? [Interjections.]
  NEW NP's SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION ON SCHOOL GOVERNING BODIES AND CRIMINAL
                   VICTIMISATION OF TEACHERS IN LADYSMITH

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Mr Chairperson, I apologise  for  that  lapse  in
good taste. There were two questions, so I will answer them separately.

The one question was from the hon Mr  Doman.  He  referred  to  the  New  NP
reneging on their obligation to parents  and  to  school  governing  bodies.
Then he referred to quality education, and  that  falls  essentially  within
the terms of reference of the Minister. We won't go into the silly  argument
about terms of reference.

The New NP took the Bill, looked at it and said very clearly - as  we  heard
the hon representative say - that there was no diminution of the  powers  of
school governing bodies. They, the DA,  are  fighting  shadow  fights.  They
cannot accuse the New NP of hypocrisy when they  are  the  real  hypocrites,
because they know, in fact, that what this does is  enlarge  the  powers  of
the governing bodies. They are having a second bite  at  it.  The  governing
body at present has no right to provide additional payments for  perquisites
- no right whatsoever. We are now conferring a right,  providing  that  that
right is cleared with the employer, which is the  province.  They  can  play
silly games then on themselves.

I think the hon Mr Doman is  good  for  tiddlywinks,  really.  He  won't  go
beyond tiddlywinks, frankly. He shouldn't play  games  with  the  House  and
impute motives to the New NP which they cannot have. Let me be quite  clear:
The words "quality education", over which I had a fight yesterday,  are  our
code words. They  demonise  the  schools  for  which  they  don't  have  any
sympathy or any feeling. They exclude those schools.

We made it quite clear  yesterday  that,  in  fact,  remarkable  things  are
happening there - in these schools - these poor schools that you are  saying
should be supported. We are supporting them. We are  transferring  resources
to the poor schools, and you don't like it half  the  time.  We  are  saying
that they will get additional staff and all that. But they are  doing  their
best and damnedest at the present time without  all  those  resources.  They
had some of the best results  last  year.  I  think  you  should  take  into
account that some of the best results  last  year  came  from  township  and
rural schools. Believe me, that is true. I don't believe in league tables.

The second question, the second point, is enormously  important  and  it  is
the question of teachers not being able  to  work,  because  their  problems
have not been solved. I think that this is a very serious  matter.  I  would
make a very earnest appeal - I say this as a person who was president of  my
own union while I lived in Ireland - that whatever we do,  the  full  effect
of what we do should not be felt  by  innocent  people,  and  they  are  the
children really.

So whatever we do,  whatever  our  grievance,  whatever  our  hardship,  the
children  should  not  be  the  recipients  of  our  action.   This   is   a
compassionate appeal, not a demand - and I'm not demonising them -  that  in
anything we do in this House or anywhere else, the  best  interests  of  the
children should be paramount. That is  why  I  would  ask  the  teachers  in
Ladysmith not to embark on that action. If you supply me  with  the  details
later, it will always be a pleasure to see you privately,  comrade.  If  you
supply me with the information privately, I will take it up with the MEC  in
KwaZulu-Natal.

Part of the problem is that many state institutions don't reply  to  letters
and  don't  listen  to  representations  in   a   reasonable   period.   The
administration Act says quite clearly that decisions  will  be  taken  in  a
reasonable time. But, more importantly, where there  is  a  crisis  and  the
children  suffer,  then  there  is  an  absolute  need  to   act   speedily,
effectively and efficiently. So if you supply me  with  the  information,  I
will take it up. I hope you will use your influence with the teachers to  go
back. The national Minister will  intervene.  Thank  you  very  much.  [Time

        CRIME AT TSHOLOFELO MANGOPE SCHOOL IN THE NORTH WEST PROVINCE

                            (Minister's Response)

The  MINISTER  OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  I   am
responding to the question relating to the incident at a  Lehurutshe  school
in the North West province. I do want to remind members of this  House  that
I have raised this big problem of vigilantism before. I have  indicated  how
vigilantism manifests itself and how it is an attack on  democracy.  History
is replete with examples of how some reactionaries resistant to  governments
had to resort to  vigilantism  as  one  of  the  instruments  used  for  the
oppression of citizens.

We must be very careful about vigilantism. It is incumbent on us  therefore,
as public representatives, to continue to educate people about this  matter.
What  we  need  to  do,  not  only  as  communities,   but   also   as   the
representatives of the people here, is to go to those  constituencies  where
we work and indicate to the people the kind of systems and measures we  have
in place that would help them deal with matters that relate  to  safety  and
security, particularly where they are required  to  interact  with  the  law
enforcement agencies of the land.

I know that this statement requires of the national commissioner  to  ensure
that he restores confidence in this country. It can't be the  responsibility
of the commissioner only. It is also our responsibility. Let us,  therefore,
ensure that we build these bridges between the law enforcement agencies  and
the people that they  serve,  to  ensure  that  this  confidence  is  indeed
consolidated. Regarding  those  who  would  want  to  form  themselves  into
vigilante groups, we need to ensure that our people do not travel down  that
path. It is a dangerous path to follow.

Therefore I want to appeal to the people  of  this  particular  township  to
ensure - even if they understand the problems better and  even  suspect  who
might have caused these problems for their community - that they must go  to
the police and report these incidents so that,  together  with  the  police,
they can put a stop to criminal actions of this kind. Thank you.

                HARDSHIPS EXPERIENCED BY FISHING COMMUNITIES

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  I  think  I
should join the other members in welcoming the hon Patricia  de  Lille  back
into the House. I think she had a good holiday.  Concerning  her  appeal,  I
have not received any letter from her,  but  it  is  probably  on  the  way.
Nothing has come to my notice.

At the same time, it would probably have been much better for  her  to  have
directed that letter to the nearest MEC, so that the  issue  could  move  as
fast as possible. I hope she is serious about what she is saying and is  not
just saying it because of the coming elections. With due respect, I hope  it
comes from her heart. Thank you.
                  RESTITUTION OF LAND RIGHTS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND   AFFAIRS:   Thank   you,
Chairperson. This is a very short Bill with  only  five  clauses,  of  which
only one is really substantial. It is a new  insertion  and  has  created  a
huge discourse, completely unnecessary and sometimes definitely malicious.

The position is that in order to speed up the procedure for restitution,  in
1999 an amendment was introduced in the  Restitution  of  Land  Rights  Act.
This  amendment  basically  made  it  possible  for  the  Minister  to   get
settlements or agreements outside the court in order to settle land  claims.
The  present  provision  gives  the  Minister  the  power  to   acquire   or
expropriate land for the  purposes  of  restitution  of  land,  without  the
necessity to obtain a court order.

The interesting thing is that the Minister's  present  expropriation  powers
are a contradiction in terms, because the Act  says  that  if  the  Minister
wants to expropriate land, she must do it  by  way  of  agreement  with  the
present owner of the land. Expropriation by definition is not by  agreement.
Why would you  expropriate  if  you  have  got  an  agreement?  This  is  an
absurdity that crept into this Act in 1999, before the elections.

We have to amend this Act, because it is clear that  in  the  absence  of  a
court  power,  the  Minister  cannot  acquire  or   expropriate   land   for
restitution purposes. She is only limited to circumstances whereby there  is
an agreement, which is fine if one has an agreement. But you do not  get  an
agreement  in  all  the  difficult  cases.  The  Minister  must  get   these
expropriation powers, in order to speed up the process.

A further problem is that the Minister has  got  ancillary  powers  that  go
together with her other powers when she  obtains  land.  Now  the  amendment
before  us  simply  says  that  the  Minister  may  purchase,   acquire   or
expropriate land for the purpose of certain objectives,  the  first  one  of
which is to restore or award land  to  a  claimant  who  is  entitled  to  a
restitution of a right to land.

In  other  words,  the  Minister's  right  to   expropriate   only   becomes
operational when there is, as a matter of fact, an  established  entitlement
to a restitution of a right to land. That is crucial for  the  understanding
of this law, because we were really defamed when it was said  that  we  were
getting outside of the rule of law or  disestablishing  the  powers  of  the
courts, which is pure nonsense.

Let me give you an example. We have a  certain  person,  Mr  Loggenberg,  an
important  manager  of  the  Transvaal  Agricultural  Union.  He  said   the
following:


  Die magte wat die wysiging aan die  Minister  van  Landbou  sal  gee,  is
  ongekend in 'n beskaafde wêreld. Geen wêreldleier of hof het die  mag  om
  die eiendom van een mens te vervreem en aan 'n ander te gee nie.  Dit  is
  bloot 'n stelsel van staatsbeheerde grondbesit.
Dit is 'n leuen. Dit is nie waar nie.  Laat  ek  vir  u  'n  voorbeeld  gee.
Verlede Vrydag is dr Phillip du Toit uitgenooi deur RSG  vir  'n  onderhoud,
sodat hy oor hierdie wetgewing kan praat. Nou sê hy daarso - en  ek  het  'n
transkripsie van wat  hy  gesê  het:  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[That is a lie. It is not true. Let me give you an example. Last Friday,  Dr
Phillip du Toit was invited by RSG for an interview so that  he  could  talk
about this legislation. Now he said these - and I have  a  transcription  of
what he said:]


  Kobus, ons is in die posisie om die volgende stelling  te  maak  dat  die
  Minister al die voorleggings aan haarself en aan  die  portefeuljekomitee
  suiwer van die tafel afgevee het.

Dis 'n leuen en ek kom terug daarna. [That is a lie and I  shall  come  back
to it.]


  Die Minister eien vir haarself die reg toe, selfs George Bush het nie die
  reg om enigiemand in Amerika se grond te onteien  nie.  Hy  kan  dit  nie
  doen.

In other words he is saying that there is  no  article  5  of  the  Bill  of
Rights in the American constitution, which says  that  no  person  shall  be
deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor  shall
private property be taken for public purpose, without just compensation.

This is the type of misleading  information  that  has  been  given  to  the
farming community and the public, and has now even been repeated here  by  a
senior member of the DA sitting next to me. [Interjections.]

The point is, shocking statements have been made  about  the  intentions  of
the ANC in this regard. We emphasised time and again in hearings and  during
proceedings in the portfolio committee that the Promotion of  Administrative
Justice Act is applicable to an expropriation. An expropriation  is  simply,
technically speaking, an administrative act of an  executive  authority  and
is as such subject to review.

Let me tell you  this.  After  the  hearings  and  the  proceedings  in  the
portfolio committee, the New NP contacted the ANC and said that they  wanted
to have a reasonable process. They realised that this is a sensitive  issue,
referring to the arguments we had in the portfolio committee. The  ANC  said
that they would, in the proceedings of the NCOP, include a reference to  the
Promotion of Administrative Justice Act. It is an Act which the ANC  brought
to Parliament and of which we are very proud.

What  will  that  imply?  It  would  mean  that  before  the  Minister   can
expropriate - and she is in any event bound by it - she must  give  adequate
notice of the expropriation. She must give a reasonable opportunity for  the
affected person to make representations. What  more  can  you  expect  in  a
reasonable and civilised society? Let me tell you that expropriation  is  an
instrument of progressive and civilised societies. If you don't  have  that,
namely a closely regulated procedure, you open the door for corruption on  a
very large scale.

Expropriation is an anticorruption measure. If you  don't  have  that,  what
would happen if the state buys in and  out  of  property  without  it  being
regulated by the procedures which we have in the Expropriation Act? The  Act
has to be amended.

Everyone who comes here to address the House this  afternoon  should  please
just tell us what the intention of the Constitution in section 25 is. It  is
to effect an amendment to the Expropriation Act, just like  the  one  before
us, for restitution purposes. If you do not agree with that, please tell  us
why you are against the Constitution, because that is what it really  means.
You are against the Constitution. You don't accept  the  Constitution.  That
is really true. [Interjections.]

Test every argument  with  which  you  oppose  this  amendment  against  the
Constitution. Look at section 25(1), which says that you cannot  arbitrarily
deprive anyone of property. There you will find that that  is  exactly  what
is being done by this Act. That is exactly what is being done  by  including
the reference to the Expropriation Act of 1975.

Test it clause by clause. Go and look at section 25(3) of the  Constitution,
which  we  include  as  a  specific  reference  here.  It  says   that   the
compensation must be  decided  by  a  court  of  law,  as  the  Constitution
requires in section 25(2). Very  fair  norms  are  spelled  out  in  section
25(3). Look at the  rest  of  section  25,  which  talks  about  the  public
interest, including the nation's commitment to land reform and  restitution.
If you are against this Bill, you are against the  land  reform  process  in
this country.

Klaar! Klaar! [Applous.] Oortuig my dat jy ten  gunste  van  grondhervorming
is en hierteen gaan stem. Dis die insig wat die Nuwe NP gekry het.  Ek  wens
hulle geluk daarmee. [Applous.]

Wat sê hierdie mense? Die DA spesifiek is op sleeptou  geneem  deur  hierdie
soort van sogenaamde regskenners soos dr Phillip du Toit, die  adviseur  van
die Transvaalse Landbou Unie.  Hulle  het  elke  woord  van  sy  ideologiese
leiding begin navolg. Dit is wat hier gebeur het. En dit  is  'n  ultraregse
standpunt. Hy is die soort van mens wat oor die radio sê:  Die  Minister  is
``hell bound''- dis sy eie woorde - om hierdie wetgewing deur te  voer.  Ons
sal dit deurvoer. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Over and done with! [Applause.] Convince me that you are in favour of  land
reform and will vote against this Bill. This is the insight that the New  NP
has gained. I congratulate them on that. [Applause.]

What are these people saying? The DA, in particular, has been taken  in  tow
by so-called legal experts of this nature, like  Dr  Phillip  du  Toit,  the
advisor for the Transvaal Agricultural Union. They have started  to  emulate
every word of his ideological guidance. This is what has happened here.  And
this is an ultra-rightwing stance. He is the kind of person who says on  the
radio: The Minister is "hell bound"  -  those  were  his  very  words  -  to
implement this legislation. We will implement it.]

We will implement this legislation. We will get the land back for  those  to
whom it belongs. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N H MASITHELA: Chair, I am not going to address  the  discussion  between
the hon member Van der Merwe and me. The  Deputy  Minister  has  dealt  with
that matter, therefore I will not deal with it. Today we are dealing with  a
significant matter in the lives of our people. For purposes of pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty, land is  key.  Access  to  land  is  a  source  of
survival for our people, especially blacks in rural areas.

On 8 November 1994, this House passed the Restitution of Land Rights Act  to
address the rights of those who were dispossessed of their land  after  June
1913 as a result of apartheid laws. The question could be asked  why  today,
nine years later, we are amending the Act. The answer  is  very  simple:  at
that time  we  were  all  excited  about  our  democracy.  We  thought  that
everybody would support transformation in this  country.  I  think  we  were
wrong. We thought everyone would be willing to return land to  its  rightful
owners who were robbed of their land through the 1913 Act.

In the principal Act, through the  1999  amendment,  land  claims  could  be
resolved by way of settlement agreement, rather than being forced to  go  to
court, thereby speeding up the process. This means that  the  settlement  of
land claims was based on the willing-buyer, willing-seller  principle.  This
process has been a very problematic one. The Restitution of Land Rights  Act
allows the  Minister  to  expropriate  land  for  restitution  only  through
negotiations with current owners outside the court.

This means that, in the absence of a court order, the power of the  Minister
to acquire or expropriate  land  for  restitution  purposes  is  limited  to
circumstances where an agreement has been reached with a landowner. With  no
order and no agreement, the process becomes completely frustrated. There  is
no reason why the Minister should be forced to obtain the agreement  of  all
interested parties if the land is needed for restitution  purposes,  as  the
Minister has the power of expropriation for land reform  purposes.  This  is
enshrined in the Constitution of this country.

 What this restriction on the Minister to expropriate land  does  is  hinder
the progress of land restitution. The Land Claims Commission has alerted  us
to the fact that in a number  of  cases  it  has  been  difficult  to  reach
agreement on negotiations, because of the exorbitant  land  price  asked  by
uncooperative white farmers. Taking these price  negotiations  to  court  is
time-consuming when considering the urgency to  resolve  this  matter,  also
taking into account that it is very costly.

Our people have been waiting patiently for us to give them their land  back,
particularly because they have lost land. How  are  we  going  to  make  the
target of 2005 to resolve all claims if we allow  the  uncooperativeness  of
commercial farmers to delay this process?
In the same  breath  I  should  acknowledge  and  congratulate  those  white
commercial farmers who supported land reform redistribution, in fact,  going
out of their way by ensuring that those who got land from  them  get  enough
support to be able to run their farm efficiently and  effectively.  However,
we should not underestimate the resistance of those white farmers to  giving
up land which they got from the masses of our country.  They  even  went  to
the extent of establishing restitution-resistance  funds  with  the  aim  of
opposing the land claims. Considering this and  other  challenges  to  fast-
tracking the settlement of our  land  claims,  we  should  congratulate  the
restitution commission on the progress they have made  so  far  in  settling
the land claims.

According to the  restitution  commission,  36 489  land  claims  have  been
finalised from 1995 to date - in fact, from  1995  until  March  2003.  This
shows that the  Government  is  willing  to  move  faster  on  this  matter.
However, I am convinced that much still needs to be done  to  speed  up  the
restitution so that we  can  meet  the  needs  of  our  people,  hence  this
amendment.

I want to appeal to those of our people who  prefer  financial  compensation
to access to land to reconsider their  point  of  view.  We  would  like  to
encourage those South Africans to consider the fact  that  land  appreciates
in value, whereas money is used  up  very  quickly  because  of  our  social
conditions, particularly because we Africans are very poor. They could  also
pass the land to their kids and their families, and land could be  used  for
producing food for their families and themselves.

Coming back to the Bill, the main objective of the  Bill  is  to  fast-track
land claims. It is also to deal with the huge backlogs of land claims.  This
is properly covered in clause 4 of the Bill, which allows  the  Minister  to
purchase, acquire or expropriate land for the purpose  of  land  restitution
and other land reforms. This means that in  future  the  Minister  will  not
need to reach an agreement with relevant landowners to obtain a court  order
in order to expropriate land.
What is of concern to me is that most of the people  have  failed  to  lodge
claims before the deadline for valid reasons. A large  number  of  them,  we
are told by  the  restitution  commissions,  did  not  claim,  because  they
thought that the Government would not comply or deliver the  land.  Some  of
them were advised or thought that they would not qualify. Now that they  see
the claims being delivered to our people, they suggest that  we  reopen  the
land claims. My problem with that is that it will be  a  can  of  worms.  I,
therefore,  suggest  that  we,  as  a  Government  which  is  committed   to
redressing the imbalances of the past caused by the discriminatory  laws  of
the apartheid government, do something about this.

The commission should also be complimented for realising this gap,  and  for
introducing the new provision in  the  Bill  that  allows  the  Minister  to
purchase,  acquire  or  expropriate  land  for  the  purpose  of   providing
alternative relief for claimants who do not  qualify  for  restitution.  The
Bill provides  expropriation  for  other  land  reform  purposes  which  are
directly related to restitution, namely redistribution  and  tenure  reform.
What all this does is to provide a holistic solution to complex land  reform
problems.

At this stage I should make an appeal to our  Government,  and  also  concur
with what was said and raised during the public hearings on this Bill,  that
the budget for land reform needs to be increased,  so  that  the  department
and the commission  can  carry  the  responsibility  given  to  it  by  this
Government, to make land accessible to our people.

Let me now just  touch  briefly  on  what  has  been  raised  by  opposition
parties, which I know  my  colleague  and  comrades  will  deal  with  quite
substantially. The issue of the power bestowed on the  Minister  to  acquire
land, or to expropriate land, without getting a court  order  is  a  problem
which I acknowledge and which the opposition is raising.

The other issue is that the Minister will be  allowed  to  expropriate  land
for any other land reform. I am  convinced  that  these  concerns  are  just
based on white fears that this Bill will enable the Government to take  over
white properties for black people. It reflects a conservative  mindset,  and
is somewhat of a resistance to  progress  regarding  the  transformation  of
unequally distributed land in this country. It  should,  therefore,  not  be
allowed to undermine the delivery of land reform and its objectives.

What these people fail to realise is that the laws of this country bind  the
Minister, like any other  member  of  the  executive.  To  ensure  that  the
Minister takes the  concerns  of  the  opposition  into  consideration,  the
landowners are entitled to make  a  representation  twice  -  first  to  the
commission and secondly to the Minister -  before  a  decision  is  made  to
expropriate.

If the landowner is not happy with the decision of the Minister  and  thinks
that the expropriation is unfair or unconstitutional, he  or  she  can  take
the matter to court. In  any  event,  the  constitutional  rights  of  these
landowners are enshrined in section 42(e) of the Restitution of Land  Rights
Act, which says that section 25(3) of the Constitution  should  be  complied
with. Therefore, the proposed amendment is not taking  away  the  rights  of
the current owners to appeal the decision of the Minister, it only  prevents
the restitution process from being delayed by uncooperative landowners.

Before I sit down, I should take the opportunity to  thank  all  members  of
the committee for the constructive  contributions  that  they  made  in  the
committee. On behalf of the committee I also want to thank  all  the  people
who made representations before the committee, ie  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs, the commission and the Ministry, particularly the Deputy  Minister;
and for the contribution  they  made  regarding  the  finalisation  of  this
legislation.

Access to land is a very contentious  issue  in  this  country  and  in  the
region. It is very difficult for everyone to agree,  especially  people  who
were dispossessed of their land and those who benefited from  discriminatory
laws.
Lastly, I should remind all people in South Africa that  through  this  Bill
the Government, under the leadership of the ANC,  shows  its  commitment  to
make the land accessible to our people. As we said in 1912, the  land  shall
belong to those who live on it, black  and  white.  I,  therefore,  wish  to
congratulate everybody who participated in this process. I am sure  that  if
all those who participated in and contributed to the matter  work  together,
we would achieve our objective as South Africans. Thank you very much.

The ANC supports the Bill.

Mnr A J BOTHA: Agbare Voorsitter, ek dink dit  sal  baie  moeilik  wees  vir
enige  iemand  om  meer  nonsens  te  praat  hier  vandag  as  wat  die  agb
Adjunkminister  gepraat  het,  maar  ek  moet   die   Voorsitter   van   die
Portefeuljekomitee gelukwens. Hy het dit sowaar reggekry.  Vir  hom  om  vir
ons te vertel dat met hierdie ding "the frontiers of poverty  are  going  to
be pushed back'' ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: Hon Chairperson, I thought it would be difficult  for  anyone
to talk more nonsense here today than the hon Deputy  Minister  did,  but  I
have  to  congratulate  the  Chairperson  of  the  Portfolio  Committee.  He
actually managed it. For him to come  and  tell  us  that  with  this  ''the
frontiers of poverty are going to be pushed back'' ...]

... is the biggest drivel  I've  ever  heard.  They're  busy  advancing  the
frontiers of poverty on a daily basis, as everyone in the country  knows.  I
don't think there is much purpose in talking to the ANC about  this  matter.
We've been speaking for weeks and weeks and every time  they  respond,  they
come with this tired old racist story that...

... dis die wit boere daar buitekant en ons is die regse wit boere  wat  nie
na iemand anders se rede wil luister nie. Vir dié wat na rede  wil  luister,
luister 'n oomblik hier. [... it is the white farmers out there and  we  are
the right-wing white farmers who do not want to listen to reason. For  those
who want to listen to reason, listen to this for a moment.]
The Restitution of Land Rights Act, which the Minister is seeking to  amend,
responds to the constitutional  undertaking  in  section  25(7)  to  restore
previously held property rights which were taken away by  that  party  which
the Deputy Minister served at a time when  this  party  was  opposing  every
single  thing  they  did  which  was  discriminatory.  The  DA   fully   and
enthusiastically supports this restitution process, even to  the  extent  of
rejecting the land affairs budget, since it  falls  far  short  of  what  is
needed to bring this shameful chapter to a close.

The Restitution of Land Rights Act of 1994 was promulgated  to  enable  this
restitution of, or compensation for, rights  which  had  been  unjustly  and
unfairly removed by racially  discriminatory  laws  or  practices.  The  Act
provides for claims to be lodged for the restoration  of  rights  previously
taken away or for equitable redress.  In  the  absence  of  a  dispute,  the
matter is settled by agreement between the interested parties - and  40  000
such claims have been settled to date, notwithstanding  the  nonsense  we've
heard here today. There is no delay whatsoever as far as that's concerned.

When there is a dispute about who the rightful owner  should  be,  the  Land
Claims Court must, quite  rightly,  adjudicate,  the  matter  in  order  for
expropriation by the Minister to happen, if and when the need  arises.  This
provision of the  Act  satisfies  section  34  of  the  Constitution,  which
determines that ``everyone has the right to have any  dispute  that  can  be
resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public  hearing  before
a court or ... '' - and this is very important - '' ...  where  appropriate,
another independent and impartial tribunal or forum''.

The Minister, who is not even here today, is, however,  not  satisfied  with
this provision of the Act, claiming in the memorandum accompanying the  Bill
that there is no reason why the Minister should either  seek  the  agreement
of the parties concerned or refer the matter to the  Land  Claims  Court  in
the absence of such  an  agreement.  Apparently  ANC  Ministers  and  Deputy
Ministers regard themselves as  exalted  beings  of  infinite  wisdom  whose
benign actions cannot be challenged or questioned.

In 1990 the Zimbabwean Minister of Agriculture also held this kind of  view,
which resulted in that Garden of Eden being turned into a barren and famine-
stricken wasteland in just 13 short years. South Africa now has to feed  the
people  of  that  country  because  their  government   has   failed   them.
[Interjections.]

The provision of this amending Bill that enables the Minister to  usurp  the
functions of a court of law in the settlement  of  disputes  certainly  does
not satisfy the requirements of section 34 of the Constitution,  as  neither
the Minister nor any member of the department can reasonably be regarded  as
appropriately constituting another independent  and  impartial  tribunal  or
forum. They will particularly not be regarded as  such  under  the  whip  of
President Mbeki to conclude the restitution by 2005, which at best  is  just
another pipe dream of the President.
This provision certainly oversteps the division between  the  three  spheres
of Government. It has for a very  long  time  -  and  universally,  in  true
democracies - been accepted that a clear distinction must  be  drawn  and  a
clear separation be maintained between the legislative,  the  executive  and
the  judicial  authorities.  This  Bill  clearly  does  not   satisfy   this
principle.

The only body that can  and  should  jealously  protect  this  division,  is
Parliament itself. It is therefore not only unwise but  even  shameful  that
hon members of this House, uncomprehendingly, especially on this  side,  and
irresponsibly on that side, marched forth to commit this folly.

For this very fundamental reason the DA totally opposes the Bill  and  finds
it irrelevant to discuss other bits and pieces,  except  to  say  that  this
Bill is not absolutely honest. It pretends that  Sections  25(7)  and  25(4)
are one and the same thing. They  are  not.  Section  25(7)  is  legislative
restoration of property rights previously held and subsequently  lost  as  a
result of discrimination, whereas reform is a socioeconomic  programme  akin
to black economic  empowerment.  And  this  certainly  does  not  belong  in
section 25(7) as envisioned by the writers of the Constitution.

No good reason has been provided by the Minister for this  amendment  up  to
this point, except to emphasise the delay  stories  and  how  difficult  the
court process is. She has never once tried to expropriate one  single  piece
of land using the present provision. It's never been done.

The true reason for this amendment must  therefore  not  be  sought  in  the
memorandum accompanying the  Bill,  but  indeed  in  the  political  climate
leading up to the general election. The much-vaunted  better  life  for  all
has patently not materialised  to  the  enormous  distress  of  millions  of
people.  Scapegoats  must  now  be  found  to  divert  attention  from   the
shortcomings of Government, in order to get the  necessary  support  at  the
polling booth. This is an extremely dangerous  and  shortsighted  folly  for
which the ANC will deservedly pay dearly in future. And the  only  way  that
we can prevent the rest of South  Africa  from  paying  dearly  is  to  vote
against this Bill and to vote against the ANC next year,  to  get  a  better
government. Thank you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Thank you, Chairperson. I must state for the record that  when
the Restitution of Land Rights Act was passed in 1994  my  party,  the  IFP,
voted against it in order to register its protest  in  support  of  a  large
number of communities who, in terms of the restitution  of  land  rights  as
was  proposed  then,  would  not  qualify  for  restitution  as  they   were
dispossessed of their land long  before  June  1913.  The  IFP  opposed  the
original Bill not because it was against the  objective  of  the  Bill,  but
because the IFP could not agree  to  the  selective  justice  the  Bill  was
exercising when it excluded others in the process of undoing the  wrongs  of
colonial and apartheid rule.

The amendment before the House  today  has  been  necessitated  by  negative
experiences arising from the implementation of restitution legislation.  The
department has told us  that  the  current  process  of  restitution  leaves
Government and the claimants open to abuse by  unscrupulous  landowners  who
exploit every loophole in the  willing-buyer,  willing-seller  process.  The
negotiation  process  in  this  regard  is  unreasonably  and   deliberately
lengthened with the aim of frustrating the whole  exercise,  thus  rendering
the whole negotiation process an exercise in bad faith.

This is done through, amongst other things, asking unreasonably high  prices
for the land or raising other points of argument as a delaying  tactic.  The
IFP believes, however, that this is a practice by a minority among  a  large
number of landowners who are committed to  restitution  of  land  rights  in
line with the spirit of nation-building.

The Bill before us  empowers  the  Minister  to  expropriate  land  for  the
purpose of restitution; to unblock the process whenever it  is  deliberately
frustrated. The original Bill brought to the portfolio committee  had  asked
to empower the Minister to expropriate for other  reform  purposes.  Through
negotiation among the parties in the portfolio committee,  this  clause  was
brought in line with other relevant legislation and procedures.

The IFP hopes that the hon Minister and the department will continue to  co-
ordinate this piece of legislation with other  legal  instruments  governing
other land reform programmes such as Esta and LRAD, in such  a  manner  that
we are able to run all the three legs of the overall land  reform  programme
through the relevant legislation.

This will also remove the suspicion that  some  have  expressed  during  the
public hearings that this  amendment  was  providing  the  Minister  with  a
multipurpose tool to cut across all the other  land  reform  programmes  and
would thus be open to abuse by any Minister in the future less committed  to
upholding the rule of law. We are assured that these amendments do  no  more
than  enable  the  Minister  to  intervene  should  the  normal  process  of
negotiation prove to fail its purpose.

The IFP is particularly happy about  amendments  to  section  42(c)  of  the
principal Act which  enable  the  Minister  to  ``...  determine,  grant  an
advance or a subsidy for the development or management of, or to  facilitate
the settlement of persons on, land which is the subject of an order ...''

Finally, there was a suggestion during the negotiations to the  effect  that
the state should also try to  investigate  instances  and  conditions  under
which it would consider the  possibility  of  assisting  land  claimants  in
taking a restitution case to court, where appropriate. There  are  obviously
a number of obstacles in this direction, such as lack of  funds.  But  given
all other factors it should be the aim of this Government to do all  it  can
to facilitate the process which tries to undo the injustice of the  colonial
and apartheid states before it.

The IFP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Ms C B JOHNSON: Chairperson, hon members, the New NP  understands  the  need
for land restitution in South Africa, yet we realise  that  there  are  many
sensitivities  and  suspicions  surrounding   land   restitution   and   the
expropriation of land, in particular.

Daar is waarskynlik min ander besprekings of debatte wat  soveel  emosie  by
mense veroorsaak as wanneer dit gaan oor grond of  die  restitusie  daarvan.
Tog, moet ons daarteen waak dat mense hulle blind staar teen  emosie  alleen
en dan nie die meriete van die argument  behoorlik  debatteer  of  ondersoek
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[There are probably few discussions or debates that stir up as much  emotion
among people as those dealing with land or its restitution.   Yet,  we  must
guard against people being blinded by  emotion  and  then  not  debating  or
investigating the merits of the argument properly.]

When this amending Bill was before the portfolio committee to be  voted  on,
the New NP voted against it. At that stage, we were of  the  view  that  not
all of our constituents' concerns were adequately  addressed.  Some  of  our
constituents  were  afraid  that  the  Bill  did  not   contain   sufficient
protection for the landowner.

Maar sedert die wetsontwerp voor die portefeuljekomitee gedien het, het  die
Nuwe NP en die regerende party verskeie gesprekke gehad  ten  einde  verdere
maatreëls in die wetgewing in te bou om te verseker dat die vrese  wat  daar
nog by ons grondeienaars en spesifiek by boere  bestaan,  aangespreek  word.
Die Nuwe NP en die ANC besef dat grondrestitusie moet  plaasvind,  maar  dat
dit  op  so  'n  wyse  moet  geskied  dat  dit  vir  almal  aanvaarbaar  is.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[But since the Bill served before the portfolio committee, the  New  NP  and
the ruling party have had several discussions  in  order  to  build  further
measures into the legislation to ensure that the fears that  our  landowners
and specifically farmers have, are allayed. The New NP and the  ANC  realise
that land restitution must take place, but that it must take place  in  such
a way that it is acceptable to everyone.]

In his address the hon Deputy Minister referred to the amendment  that  will
be inserted in the Bill to specifically cross-reference  the  provisions  of
the restitution Bill to the provisions of the  Promotion  of  Administrative
Justice Act. We thank the Deputy Minister  for  agreeing  to  the  New  NP's
request in this regard.

Watter versekering sal hierdie bepaling aan 'n  grondeienaar  gee?  Dit  sal
beteken dat die grondeienaar, in  alle  gevalle  van  onteiening,  voldoende
kennis van die doel, die aard en die omvang van die onteiening sal kry;  dat
daar 'n redelike geleentheid vir die grondeienaar  sal  wees  om  vertoë  te
rig; dat daar toegang sal wees tot 'n reg op hersiening  of  interne  appél;
en  dat  'n  grondeienaar  geregtig  sal  wees  op  geldige  redes  vir  die
onteiening.

In kort, gee dit die versekering dat die Minister nie op 'n  arbitrêre  wyse
te werk kan gaan nie, omdat die administratiewe proses altyd onderhewig  sal
wees aan geregtelike oorsig. Die feit dat  die  bedrag  van  vergoeding  ook
deur 'n hof beslis kan word, beteken dat daar wel aan  artikel  25  van  die
Grondwet gehoor gegee sal word. Grondeienaars het niks om te vrees nie.

Diegene wat in die openbaar allerhande onwaarhede versprei, spoke opjaag  of
op 'n sensasionele wyse emosies verder aanblaas deur voor  te  gee  dat  die
Minister nou allerhande onbeperkte of drakoniese magte het  en  dat  'n  hof
geen beheer daaroor sal hê nie, ken óf nie hul administratiewe  reg  nie  óf
hulle doen dit doelbewus. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[What guarantee will this provision give a landowner? This will  mean  that,
in all cases of expropriation, the landowner will receive sufficient  notice
of the objective, the nature and  the  extent  of  the  expropriation;  that
there  will  be  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  the  landowner   to   make
representations; that there will  be  access  to  a  right  of  revision  or
internal appeal; and that a landowner will be entitled to valid reasons  for
expropriation.

In a nutshell, this gives the assurance that the Minister  cannot  go  about
this in an arbitrary way, because the administrative process will always  be
subjected to judicial review. The fact that the amount of  compensation  can
also be determined by  a  court  of  law,  means  that  section  25  of  the
Constitution will indeed be adhered to. Landowners have nothing to fear.

Those who spread lies in public, raise spectres or, in  a  sensational  way,
try to stir up emotions by pretending that the Minister now has  all  manner
of unlimited or Draconian powers and that the courts will  have  no  control
over this, either do not know their administrative law or are  doing  it  on
purpose.]

In summary, the New NP is of the view that based on  the  undertaking  given
by the hon Deputy Minister that the amendment will be made to the Bill,  the
New NP believes that there are sufficient checks and balances in  this  Bill
to address our earlier concerns.

To landowners, we say: There  is  nothing  to  fear.  As  an  administrative
functionary, the exercise of the Minister's powers will  always  be  subject
to judicial review  by  a  court  or  a  tribunal  under  the  promotion  of
administrative justice. If people do not know this, they do not  know  their
administrative law.

To those who simply oppose the Bill, we ask: Will opposing this Bill  put  a
better legislative product on the table? No, it won't.  Will  opposing  this
Bill do anything to address the concerns of landowners? No,  it  won't.  The
ANC and the New NP are committed to putting a Bill  on  the  table  that  is
acceptable to all South Africans, black and  white  alike.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.] The only way to achieve this  is  by  way  of  constructive  and
consensus-seeking politics, discussions and deliberations. [Applause.]

Die ANC en Nuwe NP praat met mekaar omdat ons die beste vir Suid-Afrika  wil
hê. Die Nuwe NP gee daarom erkenning aan die rol wat  agb  Ministers  Didiza
en Lekota en die agb Adjunkminister Du Toit  by  hierdie  gesprekke  gespeel
het. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The ANC and the New NP talk to each other because  we  want  the  best  for
South Africa. The New NP therefore recognises the role  that  hon  Ministers
Didiza and Lekota and the hon Deputy Minister Du Toit  played  during  these
talks.]

The New NP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs B M  NTULI:  Chairperson,  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,  hon  members,
speaking  in  Rustenburg  in  January  2003  at  the  ANC's  91st   birthday
celebration, President Thabo Mbeki said, and I quote:


  2003 has been declared the year in which united action will  be  used  to
  push back the frontiers of poverty.
The main objective of the land reform policy is to  redress  the  injustices
of apartheid and colonialism, with specific reference to returning the  land
that was lost as a result of racially discriminatory laws. In order for  the
process to continue to function effectively,  the  constitutional  right  to
restitution must be guaranteed.

When we attained our freedom in 1994, we inherited a country  with  millions
of people who were afflicted by poverty. And, those were the people who  had
fought both for their emancipation from  oppression  and  for  freedom  from
poverty and want.

The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa guarantees equal access  to
land for all citizens. According to section 25(5) of the  Constitution,  the
Government must take reasonable legislative and other measures,  within  its
available resources, to foster conditions  which  enable  citizens  to  gain
access to land on an equitable basis. Expropriation  is  a  well-established
principle in law both in South Africa and other  constitutional  democracies
in the world.

This amendment will do away with unnecessary red  tape.  It  does  not  seek
additional powers but allows for existing powers to be  transferred  to  the
appropriate Minister responsible for land reform programmes to  ensure  that
more  claimants  enjoy  the  right  to  restitution   in   their   lifetime.
Restitution is a  rights-based  programme,  not  a  willing  buyer,  willing
seller or other forms of discretionary programmes.

Whilst it is preferable to have  a  negotiated  settlement,  it  has  become
clear that these negotiations often collapse for a number  of  reasons.  The
current landowners are not prepared to sell. They are just buying time  with
negotiations and those who  are  prepared  to  sell  often  want  exorbitant
prices for the land. This takes a lot of time.

The Minister does not propose to act without any  recourse  to  the  law  or
launching any assault on the rule of law. The rights of property owners  are
clearly  protected   under   the   Constitution,   including   cases   where
expropriation is necessary. The Minister is going through a correct  process
in order to make amendments to legislation that will  allow  more  efficient
expropriation, within the framework of the law  and  the  Constitution.  We,
the ANC, fully support this.

We, in the ANC, have a mandate from the people of  South  Africa  to  change
the country and make it a better place to live in for everybody, and we  are
going to do just that. All  the  struggles  of  our  people,  prior  to  the
declaration  of  the  Union  in  1910,  were  struggles  against  theft  and
dispossession of our land by the colonialists.

After the formation of the Union, dispossession and eviction of  our  people
from their land was entrenched through statutes such as the promulgation  of
the Land Act of 1913. This piece of legislation  was  followed  by  numerous
statutes which dispossessed the majority of  Africans  of  their  land,  and
prevented them from acquiring, and having access to, land.

Communities were torn  apart.  This  has  caused  frustration  and  economic
hardships. People were uprooted from their  roots.  All  those  who  had  no
prior rights to land were given rights to occupy  land  and  this  was  made
possible through legislation. There were no court orders.

Wawuthathwa nje umhlaba wethu kungabi ndaba zalutho.  Kuthi  indoda  yomuzi,
umnumzane, ayohlaliswa emva kwendlu yenye indoda kuthiwa  uqashile.  Yihlazo
lelo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Our land was just taken away and it  didn't  matter;  then  a  man  of  the
household, the head of the family, had  to  rent  a  room  at  the  back  of
another man's house.  That's a disgrace.]

In 1994, our democratic Government - that we fought for and  family  members
had died for and others were imprisoned for - gave us hope that  the  wrongs
of the past would be rectified. Yes,  land  was  restored  to  some  people.
However,  the  majority  of  the  people  are  still  awaiting  restitution,
restoration and redress for their land because those  who  were  pushed  off
the land were bitterly resentful. They forfeited their right to graze  stock
and had to abandon the one form of security that  they  had,  which  is  the
occupation of an arable plot.

Umuntu nje  abe  nezinkomo,  izimvu  nemifino  ukuze  izingane  zakhe  zidle
ekhaya. [A person could have cattle, sheep and vegetables so  that  children
had something to eat.]

The purpose of the Bill is to empower the Minister for Agriculture and  Land
Affairs to purchase, acquire, in any other manner, or  expropriate  land,  a
portion of land or a right  in  land  for  the  purpose  of  restoration  or
awarding such land, portion of land or right in land to a  claimant  or  for
any other land reform purpose. Section 25(8) of the Constitution  says  that
no provision of this section may impede the state  from  taking  legislative
and other measures to achieve land reform.

During the consolidation of the homelands, laws  were  used  to  expropriate
land. But, now that the democratically elected Government wants to  use  the
law to undo what the illegitimate apartheid  government  did  in  the  past,
people are screaming and kicking.

The ANC supports the Bill. In our view, it is going to speed up the  process
and facilitate the redistribution of land which will  have  a  significantly
positive impact for poor and landless people, and  redress  the  results  of
the past racial discrimination.

The  Bill  is  within  the  constitutional  framework.  Section  25  clearly
stipulates that expropriation in the  public  interest  is  allowed.  Public
interest includes the nation's commitment to land reform, and  not  only  to
roads, railways and dams. So, the Bill deals with the  inadequacies  of  the
current legislation such as the need to get an  agreement  and  court  order
before expropriation.

Konke lokhu kuchitha isikhathi ukuze  abantu  bangawutholi  umhlaba,  ube-ke
uthengiswa njalo uthengiselwa izifiki kuleli zwe.  Kuyamangaza  ukuthi  bona
laba  abangawufuni   lo   mthetho   baphinde   babe   ngabaphethe   umhlaba.
Bayabachitha abantu emapulazini abo kanti abafuni  nokuthi  uHulumeni  anike
abantu umhlaba. Kanti  umuntu  uyinyoni  yini,  uzohlala  esihlahleni,  noma
uyinyoka, uzohlala emgodini? Awubuye umhlaba, sikhathele  yile  mpicabadala.
AbeSuthu bathi: ki kgomo ya moshate wa e  gapa  o  molato  wa  e  tlogela  o
mulato.

Masibayeke-ke. Bona babona kungcono  ukwenzela  izilwane  indawo  kunokunika
umAfrika umhlaba, abawuthatha ngomthetho. Sizowuthatha-ke nathi  ngomthetho.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The whole thing wastes time so that people are not able to have  access  to
land while, at the same time, it is being sold to people who are foreign  to
this country. It is very surprising that the very people  who  do  not  want
this Bill are the same people who have the authority  over  the  land.  They
chase people away from their farms and, at the same time,  they  don't  want
Government to give people land. Is a person a bird? Is he going to sleep  in
a tree? Or is he a snake that lives in a hole? Land must be  given  back  to
the people. We are tired of this riddle. There  is  a  Basotho  saying  that
goes like this: "If you do it, you are in trouble - if you  don't,  you  are
still in trouble."

Let's leave them alone, then. They think  it  is  better  to  give  land  to
animals than to give it to Africans, land which  they  took  unlawfully.  We
will take it lawfully.]

We want to speed up the expropriation process  where  there  is  a  need  to
expropriate in order to return people to their land so that they can  create
jobs for themselves. We need land for residential and  productive  purposes.
We need to see new entrants in agriculture and also to end the  skewed  land
ownership in South Africa.
We, in the ANC, want to see poor people owning a piece of land and making  a
living out of that piece of land: urban and  rural  people,  poor  and  very
poor people, farmworkers and labour tenants.

Bonke laba abantu sibafuna  bephethe  isiqeshana  somhlaba  lapho  bezokwazi
ukuziphilisa khona. Mawubuye umhlaba,  ubuyele  kubanikazi  bawo.  Wathathwa
kobaba.  Awubuyele   kithi,   siwusebenzise   ukuze   siphile.   Ngiyabonga.
Siyawesekela  lo   mThethosivivinywa.   [Kwaphela   isikhathi.]   [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[We want all these people to have a piece of land on  which  they  would  be
able sustain themselves. Land must be given back to its rightful owners.  It
was taken away from our fathers, and so it must be given back to us so  that
we can utilise  it.  Thank  you.  We  support  this  Bill.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]]

Ms C DUDLEY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  ACDP  recognises  the  need  for
accelerated land reform in South Africa  and  supports  endeavours  to  find
fair and reasonable solutions regarding land restitution. This,  of  course,
will necessitate adequate finance, which is presently not available.

We  acknowledge  the  need  to  address  the  injustices  of  the  past  and
appreciate the difficulties faced by the  Minister  and  the  department  in
dealing  with  these  highly  emotive   issues,   which   dramatically   and
drastically impact on the  lives  of  all  concerned.  We  cannot,  however,
condone  the  drastic  measures  provided  for  in  this  Bill,  which  will
undermine stability, food security and  future  growth  and  development  in
South Africa.

The ACDP is unconvinced by the department's claims  that  these  powers  are
necessary in order to  deal  with  so-called  obstructionist  cases.  Courts
exist for the purpose of deciding on conflict  between  parties  and  it  is
unacceptable for  the  Minister  to  bypass  the  courts  for  the  sake  of
convenience. Ministerial powers to expropriate land without  a  court  order
have no place in a democratic South Africa.

Perceived property rights in South Africa have been a major factor that  has
influenced agricultural stability to  date.  Whatever  the  intention,  this
legislation will, certainly, impact on the value  of  land  and  lead  to  a
situation where both new and old farmers  have  severely  diminished  assets
with negative consequences for all.

The power to take all the land  that  government  wanted  did  not  lead  to
prosperity or productivity in Angola, Zimbabwe or Mozambique  and,  instead,
you can't even give the land away. When  land  has  no  value,  no  one  can
produce. There is no interest, no food, no investment, no rural  wealth  and
no rural development. Without good land prices, farmers have  no  collateral
to access finance for production and there is  no  incentive  to  invest  in
agriculture.

If rural prosperity does not accompany land reform,  surely,  the  objective
will have been defeated. It will be devastating if previously  disadvantaged
South Africans, who have waited so long for a time such as this, become  the
proud owners of land which has no value.
Land restitution is a sensitive issue and this  heavy-handed  approach  does
not augur well for a united and productive  South  Africa.  Farmers  are  an
important part of the food chain that produces and distributes food  in  and
out of South Africa. This major source of wealth and foreign exchange is  an
asset and is at risk of being crippled by not only the realities,  but  also
the perceptions created by this legislation.

The ACDP will vote against this Bill. [Interjections.] The ACDP, of  course,
would love to take up the challenge issued by the Deputy  Minister  to  tell
him exactly what is wrong  with  the  Constitution.  Unfortunately,  as  you
know, I'm severely restricted by time because the ACDP,  which  consists  of
seven members in the National Assembly, is  allocated  the  same  amount  of
time as parties with just one member. This is the  ANC's  idea  of  what  is
fair and equitable. [Interjections.] Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  the
desire to finalise land restitution speedily is shared by all  stakeholders,
including current landowners who have or may  have  claims  pending  against
their land.

This desire should not, however,  become  an  overpowering  factor  in  this
incredibly  sensitive  and  potentially   explosive   process.   Whilst   we
acknowledge that  there  is  a  need  to  distribute  land  for  restitution
purposes, once it borders on giving excessive  powers  to  the  Minister  it
becomes problematic. What would happen if land claims  were  rushed  through
without consultation and consensus having been reached?  Who  would  benefit
and who would suffer irreparable damage?

It may appear simple at the outset that land restitution can be  speeded  up
but once you scratch the surface, a far more complex set of issues  emerges.
It is an extremely complicated situation that requires  careful  and  supple
management. Above all, it is a process that places a heavy burden of  proper
consultation  and  dialogue  upon  all  those   involved,   especially   the
Department  of  Land  Affairs  which  must  act  as  a  fair  and  equitable
facilitator in the process.

Property  rights  remain  enshrined  in  the  Constitution.  The  desire  to
finalise land restitution speedily cannot be allowed to lead us down a  road
of costly legal and possibly even  constitutional  court  battles.  We  fear
that this is exactly what this Bill would lead to. In  such  an  event,  the
process would be delayed and the Bill would achieve exactly the opposite  of
what it set out to do. The UDM, therefore, does  not  support  the  Bill.  I
thank you.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Deputy Speaker,  this  Bill  is  of  an  urgent  nature
because it addresses some of the injustices  suffered  by  the  majority  of
citizens of this country, three quarters  of  them,  at  the  hands  of  the
minority, one quarter of them. It is a  Bill  which  seeks  to  redress  the
injustices of the past. The least that this House could do would be to  give
this Bill a unanimous endorsement.

Let me make the observation that, with time, there is  a  growing  consensus
among political parties  that,  only  a  few  years  ago,  would  have  been
unthinkable. This meeting of  minds  augurs  well  for  the  future  of  our
country for, in truth, there  is  no  future  for  this  country  without  a
vigorous restitution programme followed by an equally vigorous programme  of
land reform.

The core problem  addressed  by  this  Bill  was  well  put  by  the  Cosatu
delegation during the hearings. They observed, and I quote:


  The land restitution process has not taken  place  at  an  optimal  pace,
  raising serious questions about whether all claims  will  be  settled  in
  time to meet the 2005 deadline set down by the President.


  Again, underlying these problems is the adoption by the department of the
  willing buyer, willing seller approach to restitution which enabled  many
  current landowners to hold  up  the  process,  either  because  they  are
  generally opposed to the restitution process or demand unreasonably  high
  prices.

We agree with this assessment of the problem.  We  are  convinced  that  the
Minister has not always found bona fides among some of the  landowners  that
she has had  to  negotiate  with.  We  feel  strongly  that  she  should  be
empowered to remove all the blockages in the restitution process.

The restitution process is only a small part of the land  reform  programme.
It is common knowledge that we are dealing here with  a  small  fraction  of
the land problem - hardly a quarter of the total land of this country.

This country will never have peace until it looks  at  the  situation  in  a
realistic way. All South Africans of all colours  and  of  all  parties  are
proud of the progress made in the political and human rights  sphere.  This,
unfortunately,  is  not  matched  by  progress  in  the  land   reform   and
redistribution sphere. It does not help to adopt ostrich tactics  and  think
that the problem will go away on its own. We cannot, like the  president  of
yesteryear, leave the problem to our children. We owe  it  to  posterity  to
solve it now. All delays are inexcusable and could cost us dearly.

The PAC supports the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment Bill. [Applause.]

Mr Z KOTWAL: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Ministers and members of  the  House,
land  reform,  including  restitution,  is  a   constitutional   imperative.
According to the Constitution, no party, whether a restitution  claimant  or
a landowner, has an absolute right to land, and  neither  can  hold  a  veto
over the restitution process.

Ngo-1994  le  Ndlu  yaphasisa  umThetho  onika  abantu  amalungelo  okwabiwa
komhlaba, obizwa nge-Restitution  of  Land  Rights  Act,  ukuze  laba  bantu
bakithi  abathathelwa  umhlaba  wabo  ngesikhathi  sobandlululo  babuyiselwe
umhlaba wabo. Eminyakeni  emine  eyedlule,  lolu  hlelo  lokwabiwa  komhlaba

[Mr Z KOTWAL: In 1994 this House passed  the  Act  that  gives  people  land
distribution rights, which is called the Restitution of Land Rights Act,  so
that our people should be given back their land which was taken away  during
the apartheid era. In the past nine years this  land  restitution  programme
was handled by the courts, and for that  reason  the  programme  was  moving
very slowly.

In order for this  programme  to  move  faster,  this  House  introduced  an
amendment which gives the Minister for  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  the
right to handle this programme.

There are land claims for rural communities which were  not  processed.  The
problem is that negotiations are still under way  with  landowners  so  that
they can work closely with Government to sell their land. Some of  them  are
hard-headed.

Another problem is that when people do agree to sell their land, it is  very
expensive. [Applause.] As we  pass  this  Bill,  the  rural  community  will
benefit from it. We will avoid hunger. Mayibuye! [Applause.]

We say, as the ANC, that they must be a  little  patient;  it  will  be  all
right. As the ANC, we know how difficult it is to stay in  another  person's
place. We came out of Egypt long ago and we  are  never  going  back  there.
[Applause.]]

Restitution is a rights-based  programme,  not  a  willing  seller,  willing
buyer or other form of  discretionary  programme.  The  rights  of  property
owners are clearly protected under the Constitution, including  cases  where
expropriation is necessary. There is an  obligation  on  the  state  to  use
negotiations where possible in order to deal with property owners, but  also
to intervene decisively where negotiations do not bear fruit.

The current options available under the Restitution of Land  Rights  Act  in
situations where negotiations are not  successful  are  limited  and  biased
against the interests of claimants. This is contrary to the  spirit  of  the
Constitution which is based on balancing the rights of various parties,  but
not to the point of entrenching the status quo.  However,  the  Constitution
also  promotes  the  principle  of  transformation,   which   must   include
redressing past inequalities in areas such as land rights.

Current  landowners  have  demonstrated  the  ability   to   frustrate   the
restitution process to the point where a minute  proportion  of  claims  are
being settled through restoration of land. Experience to date suggests  that
the powers available to the state are inadequate to ensure  the  restoration
of land. It has also become clear that if we are to settle  land  claims  in
South Africa, the Government cannot be tied  down  to  having  to  wait  for
agreements to be reached with current owners.

While there have been successes in  settling  claims  administratively  over
the past years, this has only been  where  the  owner  has  been  a  willing
seller. As such claims are settled we will increasingly be left  with  those
claims where the current owner is intransigent and unwilling to  co-operate.
Even where owners are willing to sell, they are  only  willing  to  sell  at
exorbitant prices and often on certain  conditions.  The  time  involved  in
negotiating such settlements is  also  too  long.  Without  the  ability  to
efficiently bypass such  negotiations,  if  sellers  are  unreasonable,  the
Government is forced to pay excessive prices or  agree  to  conditions  that
they may not otherwise deem in the interests of the claimant.

Numerous land claims, particularly rural claims on  agricultural  land,  are
stalled due to  a  deadlock  in  negotiations  with  current  landowners.  A
solution is urgently required to break such deadlocks in a  manner  that  is
in line with the Constitution. Court processes, in terms of the  restitution
Act, have proved to be lengthy and expensive. The court is therefore  not  a
viable solution for settling claims at the scale required by  public  demand
and the targets that have to be achieved.

Opponents of the amendment have not raised any objection  to  the  principle
of expropriation but only to the use of expropriation for  land  reform,  or
when applied to the land of a particular group of  people.  This  is  not  a
legal or  constitutional  issue  but  rather  a  particular  interest  group
defending its own position. The proposed amendment does not  take  away  the
right of current  landowners  to  appeal  decisions  of  the  hon  Minister.
However, the proposed amendment does have  the  benefit  of  preventing  the
restitution  process  from  being  hamstrung  by  intransigent  owners.  The
proposed amendment will ensure  that  more  claimants  enjoy  the  right  to
restitution in their lifetime.

While it is preferable to  have  negotiated  settlements,  we  have  already
established that these negotiations have  proved  to  be  long  and  costly.
Examples of such cases are the following. Regarding  the  Uitkyk  community,
whose claim was gazetted in October 1998, nearly five years later  only  two
of the seven owners affected are prepared to sell.  The  Mafethe  claim  was
gazetted in September 1998 but was referred to the Land Claims  Court  after
negotiations with current landowners broke down. Expropriation was  done  in
Farmerfield, in Grahamstown, but it took  almost  six  years  to  take  that
through to the courts. An expropriation attempt was made in  Boomplaas  and,
again, there were technical delays which led to withdrawal. In other  words,
it is untrue  that  the  hon  Minister  has  not  implemented  the  existing
cumbersome provisions for expropriation.

Dit is ondenkbaar  dat  'n  georganiseerde  landbou  organisasie,  soos  die
Transvaal Landbou Unie, in die openbaar  die  stelling  kan  maak  dat  daar
oorlog verklaar sal word wanneer hierdie  wysiging  gepromulgeer  word.  Hoe
kan so 'n stelling gemaak word terwyl die regte van almal  beskerm  word  in
die Grondwet? (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is inconceivable that an organised  agricultural  organisation  such  as
the Transvaal Agricultural Union could  state  publicly  that  war  will  be
declared when this amendment is promulgated. How could such a  statement  be
made whilst everybody's rights are protected in the Constitution?]

President Thabo Mbeki said:


  We speak in favour of peace because our people prefer peace to war.  They
  yearn for peace because they know  from  their  experience  that  without
  peace there can be no development. Without development  we  will  not  be
  able to realise the goal of a better life for all. Without peace we  will
  fail in the effort in which we are engaged,  to  transform  ours  into  a
  country of hope, and revert to the past  on  which  we  have  turned  our
  backs, a past of misery and despair.

Grondhervorming in Suid-Afrika en  meer  spesifiek  restitusie  het  sy  rug
gedraai op 'n verlede van wanhoop en pyn. Die teruggee van grond spreek  nie
net  die  herstel  van  grondregte  aan  nie,  maar  dit  herstel  ook   die
waardigheid van 'n nasie wat nie net grond op  'n  onwaardige  wyse  verloor
het nie, maar ook hul eie waardigheid. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Land reform in South Africa, and more specifically restitution, has  turned
its back on a past filled with despair and pain.  The  return  of  land  not
only addresses the restoration of land rights but also restores the  dignity
of a nation that not only lost land in an undignified manner but also  their
own dignity.]

We need to push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  by  restoring  land  and
dignity.

In conclusion, forced removals in support of racial segregation have  caused
enormous suffering and hardship in South Africa and no  settlement  of  land
issues can be reached without addressing  such  historical  injustices.  The
task is huge and complex. Ngiyabonga. [I thank you.] [Time expired.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi. [The women's name!] Thank  you,  Madam
Deputy Speaker.

The injustices of the past have certainly left us in a  fix,  but  it  is  a
Bill such as this one that assists  us  in  correcting  the  imbalances  and
strengthening our democracy for the present and the future.
The MF, however, notes that there is a volume of work in  this  process  and
fully supports  the  need  to  accelerate  rural  claims,  noting  the  2005
deadline, and commends the accomplishment of the tasks in the urban  claims.
We have no objection to the authority that this Bill gives the hon  Minister
and note the heavy duty  placed  on  the  hon  Minister.  We  are,  however,
confident that our efficient Minister will deliver an  equitable,  efficient
and effective management process.

The MF acknowledges the constitutional rights of the  landowners  that  this
Bill protects and upholds. We firmly support this process. We find that  the
provisions to ensure that compensation is paid for  the  land  and  for  the
time and manner of payment are just and equitable, and  these  are  strongly
supported.

We are a Government for and by the people, thus landowners have rights  too,
which we will respect and uphold. The MF will stand strongly  with  the  ANC
in support of land restitution. All we ask is: Give back the land  that  was
unfairly taken away by the apartheid regime to the  people  that  owned  it.
Mayibuye imihlaba yethu. [We must be given back our land.]

The MF supports the Restitution of Land Rights Amendment  Bill.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, die agbare Adjunkminister  vir  Landbou  en
Grondsake Prof Dirk du Toit het met die laaste woorde van  sy  toespraak  my
finaal oortuig om teen dié wetsontwerp te stem. Hy't  gesê:  "We  will  give
the land back to those to whom it belongs." Dis  nogal  eienaardig  dat  die
agb Du Toit sê die Freedom Charter sê: "South  Africa  belongs  to  all  who
live in it."

Die agb Du Toit het ook die podium gebruik om 'n man by te kom wat nie  hier
is om homself te verdedig nie, Dr Phillip du Toit van die TLU.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, with the last words  of  his  speech,  the
hon Deputy Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs,  Prof  Dirk  du  Toit,
persuaded me once and for all to vote against this Bill. He said: ``We  will
give the land back to those to whom it belongs.'' It is rather strange  that
the hon Du Toit says that the Freedom Charter says: ``South  Africa  belongs
to all who live in it.''

The hon Du Toit also used the podium to attack a man  who  is  not  here  to
defend himself, Dr Phillip du Toit of the TAU.]

Hon Deputy Minister, if I have to choose which of the two Du Toits to  back,
let me assure this House I would go for Phillip and not for Dirk.

We are dealing here with  a  basic  right  enshrined  in  the  Constitution.
Section 25 explicitly states, "... no law may permit  arbitrary  deprivation
of property".

Die NA is oortuig daarvan dat hierdie wetswysiging die Minister die reg  gee
tot "arbitrary deprivation of property". Die agb Kotwal verwys na  eise  wat
vir vyf jaar lank sloer. Ek kan u verwys na mense wat al  vir  ses  jaar  in
die tronk sit en wag dat hul verhoor afgehandel moet word.

Ek sou wat wou gee vir die Minister van Justisie  om  dieselfde  haastigheid
te kry om die ellelange hofrolle van sulke mense af te handel. Die  argument
word hier gebruik van "Justice  delayed  is  justice  denied",  die  NA  sê:
"Justice denied is justice deprived."

Tot vandag toe kon ek vir besorgde grondeienaars  sê  daar  is  'n  ordelike
regproses, jy't die volste toegang tot die reg. Nou kan ek dit nie  meer  sê
nie, nie eers meer vir stedelike eienaars nie.

Hierdie  wetgewing  stuur  die  verkeerde  boodskap  uit,  dit  lyk  na  die
begintree op 'n Zimbabwe-pad. Dit bring  onsekerheid  by  grondeienaars  met
vernietigende gevolge vir stabiliteit en  voedselproduksie  in  Suid-Afrika.
Indien die Regering van  oordeel  is  dat  sekere  landbou-organisasies  die
proses onnodig wil keer, praat dan met hulle. Die  antwoord  in  Suid-Afrika
is kommunikeer, nie demoniseer nie.
Die NA  sal  teen  hierdie  wetgewing  stem.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The NA is convinced that this statutory amendment gives  the  Minister  the
right to ``arbitrary deprivation of property''. The hon Kotwal  referred  to
claims which have been pending for five years. I can  refer  you  to  people
who have been sitting in jail for six years waiting for their  trial  to  be
finalised.

I would give anything for the Minister of Justice to show the same haste  in
the finalisation of the lengthy court cases of  such  people.  The  argument
used here is: ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' The NA says:  ``Justice
denied is justice deprived.''

Up to now I have been able to tell concerned landowners  that  there  is  an
orderly legal process, that they have full access to the law. Now I  can  no
longer say that, not even to urban owners.

This legislation sends out the wrong message, it resembles  the  first  step
on a Zimbabwean road. It brings uncertainty to landowners  with  devastating
consequences for stability and food  production  in  South  Africa.  If  the
Government is of the opinion that  certain  agricultural  organisations  are
seeking to hamper the process unnecessarily, then talk to them.  The  answer
in South Africa is communicate, not demonise.

The NA will be voting against this legislation. I thank you.]

Ms T E MILLEN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the purpose of this  amending  Bill  is
to increase the powers of the Minister, one could say considerably  so  just
by looking at the introductory paragraph of the Bill.  Perhaps  the  current
Minister won't abuse such sweeping powers. However, the potential for  abuse
by future Ministers is all too evident, and no amount of  verbal  assurances
to the contrary by the hon Deputy  Minister  will  wash.  Conversely,  there
appears less security of tenure  for  existing  landowners,  notwithstanding
the  provisions  of  section  42E(3)   with   all   the   attendant   legal,
constitutional and administrative bureaucracy costs thereof.

It is a fact that the Government has vast  tracts  of  state-owned  land,  a
great deal of which is suitable for human  occupation.  Why  not  prioritise
the distribution of such land before prevailing on unwilling  landowners  to
part with theirs?

When people, traumatised by so much violent crime, call for a referendum  on
reinstating capital punishment, a common  response  is  whether  those  same
people would be so eager to call for  constitutional  reform  regarding  the
land issue, presumably to expedite Zim-style land invasions. However,  there
is a crucial difference between the two issues.

For  example,  support  for  the  death  penalty  -  according  to  numerous
impeccably researched surveys and phone-ins on radio  and  TV,  as  well  as
editorials and letters to the press - enjoys overwhelming support  from  all
South Africans, rich and poor, transcending racial, cultural  and  political
divides, and uniting the nation in support of tough measures to  combat  the
tidal wave  of  crime;  whereas  the  land  issue  does  not  enjoy  similar
unanimous support and instead serves to dangerously divide the nation  along
mainly racial lines.

Existing laws are sufficient  to  deal  with  legitimate  land  restitution.
Therefore, the Bill under discussion is  unnecessary  and  undesirable,  and
the IAM will not support the  Bill.  I  thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.
[Interjections.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, today we are considering  a  Bill
that Azapo believes will accelerate the restitution of  rights  to  land  of
people whose land was taken away without compensation. [Applause.]

This process demonstrates that  those  of  us  who  support  this  Bill  are
willing and prepared  to  leave  behind  us  the  degrading  past  that  saw
uncivilised human beings taking land from indigenous  inhabitants  by  force
and other means, reducing black people to  beggars  in  the  land  of  their
birth, yet claiming that the act of forcibly  removing  other  human  beings
from  land  that  they  occupied   for   centuries   was   consistent   with
civilisation.

In Azapo's terms, civilised people do not take away property that  does  not
belong to them,  let  alone  by  force.  [Applause.]  Civilised  people  use
democratic  means,  as  demonstrated  by  this  Bill,   to   acquire   land.
[Applause.] Those who take pleasure in denying the rightful owners  of  land
their right to occupy their land, have no consciousness of  the  history  of
dispossession or any will to ensure the future. For these men and women  the
aim consists of defending the past for selfish ends.

During the portfolio committee hearings and  debates  on  this  Bill,  Azapo
came to the  conclusion  that  this  Bill  makes  a  section  of  the  white
community fearful. They fear the solution prescribed in  the  Bill.  At  the
same time, some of their fears are about a  black  Minister  who  cannot  be
trusted with expropriation powers. [Applause.]

But this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of  the  restitution  of
past imbalances. Azapo believes that there cannot be peace  and  justice  in
our land until black  people  are  accorded  their  right  to  proportionate
ownership of the  country's  land  and  wealth.  Azapo  supports  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Agb Adjunkspeaker, ek het 'n vriend  gehad  wat  graag  gesê
het: "Wat is die lewe nou sonder 'n ou geestigheidjie." Nou ek sê nie  graag
vir iemand hy praat onsin nie, so ek sal liewer sê die agb Du  Toit  het  'n
paar geestigheidjies  met  ons  gedeel  vandag.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Dr J T DELPORT: Hon Deputy Speaker, I had a friend who liked to say:  ``Wat
is die lewe nou sonder 'n ou geestigheidjie?'' [What is life without  a  few
witticisms?] I do not like telling to anyone that he  is  talking  nonsense,
so I shall rather say that the hon Du Toit has shared a few witticisms  with
us today.]

But he also confirmed that this Bill tries to achieve a  short  cut  in  the
whole process envisaged by the Land Claims  Court.  This  makes  that  whole
process obsolete, because why have a Land Claims Court adjudicating a  claim
if the same result can be  achieved  by  a  stroke  of  a  pen  and  through
expropriation?

The Constitution confines expropriation to  within  certain  parameters  and
certain limits. It says you can expropriate, basically, for public  purposes
and for land reform, and that's it. It does not say you can expropriate  for
the purposes of restitution. But the hon Minister  ...  [Interjections.]  It
does not say that. Read it, give me the same amount  of  time,  and  I  will
challenge you in an open debate on an equal footing and  I'll  tear  you  to
pieces, hon Minister. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Dr J T DELPORT: Restitution can also only be brought under the  umbrella  of
expropriation if it is part and parcel  of  land  reform,  but  land  reform
needs to be defined. At present all we know about land reform  is  contained
in policy statements. To empower a Minister to expropriate for  the  purpose
of land reform is tantamount to saying that the  Minister  of  the  day  may
expropriate in terms of his own policy on land  reform.  This,  surely,  can
never be constitutional. Such a result cannot ever be said  to  comply  with
our constitutional benchmark of rule by law, and not rule by discretion.

It is our considered view that this amending Bill falls foul of the test  of
constitutionality. The DA  will  petition  the  President  to  withhold  his
assent to the Bill, and, if the President does assent,  other  avenues  will
be pursued by the DA. May the day come when I can confront  the  hon  Deputy
Minister in an equal argument, with equal time, on the constitutionality  of
this Bill. [Interjections.]

Ek sien uit daarna, agb Du Toit. [I am  looking  forward  to  that,  hon  Du
Toit.]

Mr D M DLALI: Deputy Speaker, I think what I need to do before I  deal  with
this Bill is address the hon Delport. Perhaps we should check where he  went
to school, because it is very clear that he cannot read the Constitution.  I
want  to  draw  your  attention,  hon  Delport,  to  section  25(5)  of  the
Constitution. It is very clear, in no uncertain  terms.  I  will  deal  with
that at a later stage.

I thought I should also deal  with  the  view  raised  by  the  UDM.  It  is
unfortunate  that  the  UDM  was  not   even   part   of   this   committee.
[Interjections.] They have never seen this particular Bill. I  do  not  know
where they get the information that this Bill does not address  what  it  is
that they want addressed. It is totally wrong.

If you look at what the hon Botha said, it made  me  ask  myself:  How  many
farms does he own in this country? It is  very  clear  that  he  is  looking
after his  own  personal  interests  rather  than  those  of  this  country.
[Interjections.] I don't know how many farms he has in Zimbabwe, because  it
seems to me that he also has interests in Zimbabwe. He should rather go  and
concentrate on that. [Interjections.]

Before debating this issue, I thought I should mention a few issues.  First,
the Constitutional Court, in the Grootboom  case,  which  is  what  the  hon
Delport mentioned, recognises access to land as a socioeconomic  right.  The
said court drew the attention of the Government, in the Grootboom  case,  to
the Constitution and said:


  The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa guarantees equal  access
  to the  land  for  all  citizens.  According  to  section  25(5)  of  the
  Constitution, the Government must take reasonable legislative  and  other
  measures within its available resources to foster conditions which enable
  citizens to gain access to land on an equal basis, and rights are  viewed
  in  the  context  of  property  rights  that  are  protected  under   the
  Constitution.

Section 25(7) states that a person or a community that lost  property  post-
1913 due to discriminatory laws is entitled to restitution or  redress.  The
said  court  in  the  Grootboom  case  concluded  that  provisions  in   the
Constitution pertaining the economic and social rights  entrench  the  right
to land, equity, housing, health care, food, water and social security.

It is very clear, therefore, that the link has been made between  the  right
of access to land and the socioeconomic right. It  is  also  clear  that  it
places the burden of emphasis or the responsibility on  the  Government  and
state to create conditions to enable citizens to gain access to land, on  an
equitable basis. We need to push back the frontiers of poverty  and  realise
better lives for all the citizens of South Africa. Land  must  be  given  to
the landless people.

It is important to explain the different powers  of  the  Minister  and  the
powers of the various courts or the judicial process.  This  amendment  does
not  cause  any  confusion  as  far  as  their  powers  are  concerned.  The
Minister's jurisdiction is completely separate from the jurisdiction of  the
judicial system. The court or any aggrieved party  will  have  access  to  a
court at any given time the party wishes to go to court. This  also  applies
in terms of section 34 of the Constitution

The exercise of powers under the Restitution of Land Rights Act  is  subject
to review by the Land Claims Court and section 36(2). If  any  appropriation
for redistribution or tenure reform  is  done  in  terms  of  the  preferred
general  provision  of  the  Restitution  of  Land  Rights  Amendment  Bill,
disputes about these appropriations will be heard in the Land Claims  Court.
The Minister is duty bound  by  the  relevant  legislation  as  far  as  the
judicial process is concerned.  The  Minister  cannot  work  arbitrarily  in
these matters, and the Minister does not work individually. There is  always
collective work. I hope it is clear that there are  different  jurisdictions
in this case.

Why do we need this amendment? We need  to  accelerate  land  redistribution
for socioeconomic reasons, for the betterment of  those  who  were  forcibly
removed by the previous regime. The Constitution allows us to do just  that.
One presenter in our public hearings said:


  Court processes in terms of the present restitution Act have proved to be
  lengthy and expensive. The court therefore is not  a  viable  option  for
  settling claims on the scale required by public demand  and  the  targets
  announced by the President.

It is very clear that most  people  out  there  agreed  with  the  amendment
before this House today.

The ANC Government is determined to bring this dignity to  the  people.  The
ANC  was  elected  by  the  majority  of  our  people  to   speed   up   the
transformation agenda. It is going to be re-elected by  a  greater  majority
to speed up and accelerate this transformation and push back  the  frontiers
of poverty. Those who oppose this amendment  oppose  the  transformation  of
this country, and South Africans must judge for  themselves.  One  presenter
also said:


  As such claims are settled, we  will  increasingly  be  left  with  those
  claims where the current owner  is  intransigent  and  unwilling  to  co-
  operate. Even where owners are willing to sell, they are only willing  to
  sell at a very high price, and often on certain conditions.

If you have all these claims, what do you do? You  have  no  option  but  to
follow the Constitution and accelerate delivery of the land to the poor.

I want to appeal to the white farmers to co-operate, to release land to  the
Government willingly for redistribution for the improvement of the lives  of
the people. [Interjections.] History will  judge  you  otherwise.  You  must
write your history now. Now is the time for you to do just that.

People outside these Chambers are hungry for land and  are  landless,  while
there are those who still occupy more than 70% to 80%  of  the  land,  while
the majority of people are poor. They  cannot  feed  themselves;  they  need
food to feed themselves, not to be employed by the  masters  as  master  and
servant on the farms, and be farmworkers for the rest of their  lives.  They
want to apply what we call vukuzenzele. It is time now to  show  the  spirit
of vukuzenzele by getting land and being a landowner in your own country.

There are those who own eight or nine or ten farms. You can go  on  and  on,
and you would get tired of counting, but they do  not  want  to  give  those
farms   to   Government   for   redistribution   at   a   reasonable   cost.
[Interjections.] Another presenter at our hearing said:


  This expropriation amendment is not unconditional provided it is done  as
  part of the law of  general  application  and  that  just  and  equitable
  compensation, not necessarily market value, is paid. The Bill proposes to
  do both.

This matter should be seen as part of the transformation process, but it  is
understood that transformation is not an easy process. All  of  us  need  to
join hands and deal with transformation effectively  and  head-on.  We  must
expose further all those who  are  opposed  to  the  Government  agenda  for
transformation.

The other issue which was raised by most of the  presenters  in  the  public
hearings is the critical question  of  resources  and  capacity  within  the
Commission on the Restitution of Land Rights,  and  needs  to  be  addressed
effectively. All parties agreed on this particular issue.

The critical issue here again is that the status quo is taking a  very  long
time to change, and it is a very expensive process before agreement  can  be
reached between both parties, and the beneficiaries are  the  most  affected
parties in this process. Therefore, this amendment is addressing just that.

I want to appeal to AgriSA to appeal to its members to co-operate  with  the
Government and release land or farms for the  poor  people  to  redress  the
inequalities on an equitable basis. I am appealing to  AgriSA  because  they
informed the committee that their members are not opposed to  transformation
and restitution.  Therefore,  the  ball  is  in  their  court  to  show  the
Government by actions and deeds, and they must  inform  and  instruct  their
members to do just that.

I would be failing in my duties if I did not deal with the views  raised  by
the  Transvaal  Agricultural  Union  on  this  matter,  together  with   the
agricultural employers organisation,  represented  by  their  lawyers.  They
said:


  This amendment is a declaration of war to white farmers, and  the  target
  is white commercial farmers. There will be no rule of law.

They went further to suggest that the state has huge tracts of land  in  the
homelands and that the state must take the  land  in  the  homelands  rather
than the land within the urban areas.

I want to state very clearly that there is no declaration of  war  on  white
commercial  farmers.  If  the   Transvaal   Agricultural   Union   and   the
agricultural employers' organisation are opposed  to  this  amendment,  they
are opposed  to  any  restitution  of  land  to  the  landless  and  to  any
transformation in this country. They further want the  African  majority  in
this country to remain in the reserves and/or former homelands, just as  the
previous regime implemented separate development. They  oppose  nonracialism
in this country.

What more do they want? They need the status quo;  that  small  minority  in
this country must remain in ownership  of  70%  to  80%  of  the  land.  The
African poor majority must suffer for the rest of  their  lives.  They  must
remain poor while the few landowners get richer and richer out of the  sweat
and blood of the poor African majority in South Africa.

We will never allow this to happen. Those who  think  the  status  quo  must
remain,  should  forget  about  it.  This  Government  will   proceed   with
transformation and accelerate the restitution of land to the landless  poor.
I want to warn  those  landowners  and  farmers  who  are  intransigent  and
unwilling to co-operate that time is running out for them.  My  free  advice
to them is: Please co-operate.

We want land for the poor  so  that  they  can  go  back  and  farm  and  be
commercial farmers as they used to be before  they  were  forcibly  removed,
and feed themselves and their families. ``The land shall be  shared  amongst
those who live in it.'' We must push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  and
create a better life for everyone. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, we  had
some very good speeches this afternoon. I am thinking of  the  hon  Kotwal's
brilliant speech, the speech  by  hon  Ngema  and  the  chairperson  of  the
committee himself. We saw how Azapo  used  two  minutes,  whereas  the  ACDP
couldn't. [Laughter.][Applause.]

We then had a lot of poor speeches. My summation  is  that  the  people  who
gave those speeches are not really interested in land restitution  and  land
reform. They don't know much about it and that is why they  were  not  good.
The biggest disaster perhaps, was the hon Delport.  [Interjections.]  I  now
begin to understand why during those  days  in  Kempton  Park,  the  old  NP
dropped him  from  their  negotiation  team.  That  is  because  going  into
negotiations with that type  of  constitutional  nonexpertise  really  could
land you in big trouble. [Applause.]

Do you know what the hon Delport  really  said  here  today?  He  said  that
restitution is not in the public interest, is not a public  purpose  and  is
not in the general interest of this country. [interjections.] What  he  said
is that we can't use expropriation under section 25  for  land  restitution,
but we can use it for land reform.

In his understanding, other than ours,  restitution  is  not  part  of  land
reform. In other words, what he propagated here today, is that when  we  buy
land for land reform, we shouldn't do in  on  the  free  market.  We  should
start  expropriating  it.  Is  that  now  the  policy  of   the   DA,   that
expropriation for normal  nonrestitution  purposes,  land  reform  purposes,
should be done? That is what he said today here. That's the  implication  of
what he said.

Now I am sorry to say that I was not impressed  by  his  proposals  here  at
all. We have the very interesting situation that someone like the hon  Botha
came here and dished up section 34 of  the  Constitution,  which  says  that
when there is a conflict you can always go to  the  court.  Perhaps  I  must
just tell him that it is said in the Bible:

Vanwaar Gehasi? Is hy nog hierso? [Whence Gehasi? Is he still here?]

He didn't understand a thing about this. The problem with  the  DA  is  that
they don't make any distinction. They don't differentiate  between  using  a
court to expropriate and the fact that expropriation is  always  subject  to
adjudication. What we are saying is that the true place of expropriation  is
that it is an executive act. It is an administrative act. In  terms  of  the
separation of powers, it is not a thing which is primarily something that  a
court should do. A court can adjudicate. We don't take away  that  right  to
adjudicate on the expropriation acts of the executive.

You must make that distinction. The failure to see that is  the  root  cause
of the problem of the hon Delport and the hon Botha. But you know  what  the
situation is now. Let me put this in Afrikaans.

Ons het nou die situasie dat die DA  hand-om-die-blaas  sit  met  ultraregse
elemente in hierdie land. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dis nou  waar  ons  beland  het.
Hul posisie is dieselfde. Wat is dit waarmee ons besig is? [We now have  the
situation that the DA is being very friendly with  ultra-rightwing  elements
in this country. [Interjections.] This is where  we  have  ended  up.  Their
position is the same. What is it that we are engaged in?]

We should never forget that we have here the  results  of  grand  apartheid.
That's why we must engage in restitution. It was the evils done under  grand
apartheid. Land was taken away, black spots were removed  by  the  so-called
expropriation Acts. And that  is  what  we  are  correcting.  Today  we  are
actually attending part of the funeral of grand  apartheid.  [Applause.]  We
are attending the funeral of the Tomlinson Commission. We are attending  the
reburial of Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

            ABUSE OF TRAVEL AND PARMED FACILITIES BY MR M B NTULI

                                  (Ruling)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, before we proceed with the rest  of  the  business
of the House, I want to deal with a disciplinary matter concerning  the  hon
Mr Ntuli, a member of this House. I had  asked  the  ANC  whips  to  try  to
ensure his presence.

Allegations were brought to my attention that the  member  had  abused  both
his travel facilities and his Parmed facilities. As is my custom,  I  called
in the member - he was accompanied by a whip  -  and  informed  him  of  the
allegations. I then referred the allegations to the  Disciplinary  Committee
to conduct an investigation and advise me on appropriate action. The hon  Mr
Doidge was appointed to chair the  committee  as  the  Deputy  Speaker,  who
normally chairs the  Disciplinary  Committee,  is  the  chairperson  of  the
Parmed Management.

The  Disciplinary  Committee  has  over  the  past  few   weeks   repeatedly
interviewed Mr Ntuli and members of his  family,  and  received  affidavits.
The committee presented its report to me this morning. I thank them for  the
expeditious and thorough  manner  in  which  they  have  carried  out  their
responsibilities. I have based my decision in this case on the findings  and
recommendations of the committee.

The specific charges which the committee investigated were:

Firstly, regarding members' travel facilities,  the  member  had  registered
dependants who did not qualify in terms  of  Parliament's  official  policy;
had allowed adults to travel on child dependants' vouchers; and had  allowed
nonregistered persons to travel on dependants' vouchers. As far as  we  have
been able to establish so far, the amount involved exceeds R56 100.
Secondly,  concerning  Parmed  facilities,  the  member  was  charged   with
defrauding Parliament and its members by allowing  his  fiancée  to  receive
treatment  and  confinement  in  his  daughter's  name,   and   allowing   a
nondependant to receive medical treatment in the name of another daughter.

I had hoped  that  Mr  Ntuli  would  have  appeared  before  the  House,  as
requested. Nonetheless, I will proceed.

The  committee  has  reported  that,  after  lengthy  hearings,  the  member
admitted infringement of the rules  in  relation  to  all  the  charges  and
pleaded guilty to defrauding Parliament on each specific charge.

The committee has reported further that, after  he  had  agreed  to  provide
evidence under oath, he initially misled the committee, even  after  he  had
been warned that  lying  to  the  committee  would  constitute  contempt  of
Parliament. The committee  therefore  reported  that  it  found  the  member
additionally to be in contempt of Parliament and that it regarded this in  a
very serious light.

The member, by his actions, has  wilfully  breached  the  public  trust  and
undermined the integrity of the House and,  indeed,  the  entire  democratic
process. There are constitutional limitations to the  steps  the  House  can
take in such circumstances, but as Speaker of the House I  must  inform  you
that such actions are totally unacceptable.  I  therefore,  in  this  public
forum, issue a severe reprimand to Mr Ntuli for  his  reprehensible  conduct
in respect of the abuse of travel  facilities  and  medical  aid  facilities
and, in particular, for making himself guilty of contempt of  Parliament  by
lying to the committee and persisting to do so under oath.

I impose the following specific penalties in respect of the abuse of  travel
facilities:


  (1) The exact extent of travel abuse will  be  identified  and  recovered
       from the member; and


  (2) all travel benefits for the member and his dependants are immediately
       withdrawn for the remainder of the term in Parliament.

Relevant information and  documentation  relating  to  this  abuse  of  both
travel facilities and Parmed facilities is being referred  to  the  Director
of Public Prosecutions and to the political  party,  the  ANC,  for  further
investigation.

In compliance with a specific request of the  committee,  I  report  to  the
House their view, which I fully endorse, that the member is  not  worthy  of
holding public office. This sentiment will also be pertinently  referred  to
the political party for attention.

Hon members, that is my decision. The penalties will be imposed.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of  order:  There  are  four  hon
Ntulis in this House. Three of them are gentlemen  and  one  of  them  is  a
lady. I think, just for the purposes of the record, one should identify  the
Mr Ntuli concerned as Mr M B Ntuli.

The SPEAKER: Order! It is Mr M B Ntuli, but there  is  some  dispute  as  to
whether it is B M or M B. [Laughter.] Thank you for that  clarity.  We  will
ensure that penalties are not imposed against the incorrect member.

                       SECTIONAL TITLES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

There was no debate.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, if you are leaving the House, will  you  do
so quietly, please.

Hon members and hon Whips, I think you should  avoid  the  disruption  of  a
vote in this House. To have this  kind  of  thing  shows  a  great  deal  of
disrespect. Please ensure, if your members must leave, that  at  least  they
wait until the Bill has been read a second time before they  walk  out,  and
do so quietly.

Bill read a second time.

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, the Bill that I am laying before  this
House brings back painful memories which torment the soul, especially  among
black people who were not included because of the colour of their skin.  The
apartheid government was diligently  protecting  the  rights  of  the  white
people.

The national movement, the ANC,  seriously  took  an  oath,  rolled  up  its
sleeves and joined the struggle, fighting for the freedom of the  people  of
this country. The ANC geared itself up, pierced with the spear, and  did  so
thoroughly; did trampling work and  carried  on  with  the  battle  although
bleeding, and that because of  the  rights  of  the  black  people  of  this
country.

The apartheid government could not stand against the vicious  anger  of  the
workers. It raised its arms in the air and gave up,  whilst  the  heart  was
pounding.

And when they gave up, they decreased the  funds  in  the  coffers  so  that
workers would have to  share  the  meagre  amount  left.  This  fund  became
drained and workers were left holding onto their  cheeks  in  despair.  Over
the years the fund went through turbulent times like when  wet  dung  cannot
catch fire. All this is a deliberate act intended to cause hardship for  the
black community.

The people's Government that is led  by  the  national  movement,  the  ANC,
intervened and changed this situation. It  was  with  this  change  that  it
became apparent that all workers who are  at  risk  of  being  abused,  like
domestic workers, had to be included in this Bill, for  the  first  time  in
history. It was imperative that we do this so that  the  financial  standing
of this fund could change and become sound.]

Two years ago we tabled before this House a new Unemployment Insurance  Bill
and promised you that the promised legislation was aimed  at  repealing  the
old Act, which was discriminatory in its application  and  spurious  in  its
fiscal logic. We indicated then  that  unless  we  took  the  path  we  were
proposing, the fund would perpetually remain in  the  red  and  continue  to
place a perpetual burden on the fiscus.

Indeed, Parliament heeded our call and agreed to repeal the  apartheid-style
Unemployment  Insurance  Act  of  1966  through   the   enactment   of   the
Unemployment Insurance Act of 2001. We've now had two years of  implementing
the new Act, during which we have made major gains, but, as fate would  have
it, we have also learnt lessons  as  we  were  implementing  our  turnaround
strategy.

The proposed amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act are  part  of  the
successful turnaround strategy being implemented by the fund, based on  four
main pillars,  namely  legislative  reform,  information  technology,  human
resource  and  institutional  restructuring.  The  successful  and   ongoing
implementation of this strategy has already resulted in an increase  in  the
fund's income from R2,1 billion in 2001 to  R3,8  billion  in  2002-03.  The
fund also continues to provide benefits to unemployed workers.

Despite the fact that 2002-03 saw a  decline  in  unemployment  and  illness
benefits, the UIF experienced an increase in benefits  paid  to  workers  on
maternity leave and the dependants of  deceased  contributors.  A  total  of
R2,3 billion was paid out to unemployed workers  while  over  three  million
commercial employees have been registered with the fund.

The fund has a surplus of R1,4 billion from a previous string  of  deficits.
As part of the turnaround strategy, we were able to contain  expenditure  in
an attempt to return  to  financial  health  and  to  create  the  financial
strength needed to bring about lasting change.

Part of the new policy framework is an annual actuarial evaluation.  In  the
2002-03 evaluation the actuary concluded  that  the  fund  was  in  a  sound
financial state  on  a  cash  flow  basis.  In  line  with  sound  financial
practice, the fund has started to implement a  reserve  policy  with  effect
from the 2002-03 financial year.

As I mentioned, one of the  pillars  of  the  turnaround  strategy  was  the
implementation of this  new  legislation,  which  saw  the  fund  widen  its
coverage, increase its revenue base and also improve compliance  levels.  To
date more than 560 000 domestic employers have registered  and  the  details
of over 430 000 domestic workers have been captured on the data  base.  This
can only be done by the only party in  this  country  that  can  better  the
lives of our people, the ANC.

With regard to the Bill  before  this  House  today,  it  provides  for  the
following amendments: the removal of the definition of the CCMA  in  section
1 of the Act will mean that the CCMA will no longer have  jurisdiction  over
UIF appeals, and regional appeal committees will take  over  this  function;
the removal of the definition of seasonal workers will  give  this  category
of employees coverage. That again can only be done by the  movement  of  the
people of this country, the ANC, because the previous exclusion  was  unfair
and, in my view, discriminatory.

With the amendments we also  exclude  `public  servants'  as  defined  under
section 1(1) of the Public Service Act of 1994. This matter was referred  to
the Public Service Bargaining  Chamber.  That's  where  the  issue  must  be
raised.

The  amendments  also  address  a  situation  of   the   multiple-employment
relationship  of  domestic  workers  and  bring  in  a  concept  of  partial
unemployment for those workers with more than one employer.  This  amendment
is aimed at ensuring that a domestic worker who is  employed  by  more  than
one employer and loses one or more of those employers shall be  entitled  to
benefits.

The amendments will also recognise that unemployment may arise for  domestic
workers in the  event  of  the  death  of  an  employer.  The  Bill  further
streamlines the benefits to allow claims officers to  top  up  benefits  for
those employees who continue to receive income from their  employers  whilst
unemployed as a result of maternity, ill health or, as required by  law,  to
take adoption.

As you, hon members, would have noted, the Bill  that  I  place  before  you
today does not seek to overhaul  what  we  all  believe  is  an  appropriate
policy framework for unemployment insurance, but only seeks to  sharpen  the
policy  instrument  we  have  devised  as  our  contribution.  Should  these
amendments be adopted, they shall go a long  way  towards  building  on  the
successes I have outlined above.

I beseech all of you,  hon  members,  to  support  this  Bill  in  order  to
strengthen the current  legislative  instrument  in  meeting  the  needs  of
fellow South Africans who find themselves in  a  situation  where  the  only
place they can turn to for relief is  the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Chairperson, the DA supports the amendments  to  the  Act,
such as the inclusion of  seasonal  workers  and  the  exclusion  of  public
servants from UIF benefits, which  also  addresses  the  issue  of  multiple
employers of domestic workers and some of the technical aspects involved.  I
will not go into detail about these amendments, which are an improvement  to
the Act, and which the hon Minister has already elaborated on.

The one amendment which we wholeheartedly support is  the  establishment  of
regional appeals committees which will handle appeals against  decisions  of
the Unemployment Insurance Commissioner.

The present position is that a person who is entitled to benefits under  the
Act may appeal to  the  Appeals  Committee  of  the  Unemployment  Insurance
Board, if that person  is  aggrieved  by  a  decision  of  the  Unemployment
Insurance Commissioner or a claims officer, and also to the  Commission  for
Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration.

These appeals will now be decentralised  to  provinces.  We  sincerely  hope
that appeals will ensure greater efficiency in the processing of claims.  At
the moment some of these claims take months to be processed.

I have one case in which I have made  representations  to  the  Unemployment
Insurance Commissioner about a Ms Surita Coetzer of Saldanha, who  has  been
trying for almost 18 months to get her benefits. She  applied  for  benefits
on  23 April  2002  and  her  application  was  refused  by  the  Vredenberg
suboffice in July 2002, in  terms  of  section  16(1)  of  the  Unemployment
Insurance Act of 2001. She lodged an appeal in July 2002 and the appeal  was
received by the head office in Pretoria. The case is boxed  in  between  the
regional office and Pretoria and has not been finalised.

I have also made representations in respect  of  another  case,  which  took
more than a year to be finalised. From the feedback I get from  the  public,
this seems to be the norm. This is quite unacceptable. I must  concede  that
the office of  the  commissioner,  as  well  as  the  parliamentary  liaison
officer of the department have been very helpful, but  it  should  not  take
the intercession of a member of Parliament to resolve these cases, sir.  The
system must work properly and efficiently.

I would suggest that the department evaluates its day-to-day  operations  in
respect of service delivery. What has happened to Batho Pele?

The long delays in the payment of UIF benefits to applicants  are  not  only
confined to appeals. They also affect ordinary  applications  for  benefits.
Not so long ago, the Cape Argus reported on a case of a person who has  been
waiting for more than 11 months. People are sent from pillar to  post.  Most
of the applicants are normally  in  dire  straits  and  hopeful  that  their
benefits will be paid out in time.

These are not isolated cases. This seems to be  the  norm.  People  complain
regularly that they have to  deal  with  unhelpful  and  sometimes  arrogant
officials. To get through to the office of the department telephonically  is
sometimes an impossibility. It is high time that the Minister jacked up  his
department.

In his ministerial briefing last week, he said, and I  quote:  "The  picture
is not bleak because Government is on track in delivering a better life  for
all.'' People are not experiencing the better life for all  on  the  ground.
He must stop sitting in his ivory tower and go to his  regional  offices  to
see what is happening. People deserve an  enhanced  service  delivery.  They
need a better life, not empty political rhetoric. Thank you.
Mr S A MSHUDULU:  Chairperson,  hon  members  of  Parliament,  distinguished
guests and the nation at large, I stand here  in  support  of  the  Bill  on
behalf of the ANC. The ANC in Government has sought and  continues  to  seek
to confront the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment, and to ensure  a
better life for all through a comprehensive,  people-centred,  people-driven
programme of social transformation. It is also unquestionable that  the  ANC
is a leading force in social transformation.

In its 51st  national  conference  in  Stellenbosch,  the  ANC  resolved  to
continue with plans towards a comprehensive social security  system  through
an ongoing review of existing social security measures, such as the UIF  and
social grants.

Chairperson, for this reason, it is important that we educate  some  of  the
members, like Mr  Redcliffe  here,  to  the  effect  that  the  Unemployment
Insurance  Amendment  Bill  is  intended  to  transform   the   unemployment
insurance, and what necessitated its  amendment  were  the  high  levels  of
unemployment and joblessness that are prevalent in the economy.
Unemployment  insurance   provides   adequate   and   accessible   benefits,
particularly to vulnerable low-paid workers, as mentioned by  our  Minister.
Its finances were structured, as he indicated earlier, in such a way  as  to
ensure an adequate flow of contributions from  workers,  employers  and  the
state.

As you know, people were using the old blue card. From the old,  we  changed
to a sustainable component of  the  postapartheid  labour  market  which  is
anchored on the progressive principles  of  redistribution  and  solidarity.
High-income, low-risk employees are brought under the  ambit  of  the  fund,
and Government has firmly committed itself as an underwriter  of  the  fund,
as the Minister mentioned earlier.

It was also restructured in such a manner that it is  viable.  However,  the
UIF can only provide short-term relief  to  those  who  have  been  recently
employed, and this resulted  from  the  distortions  in  the  South  African
labour market that tend to perpetuate job  insecurity,  hence  there  was  a
need for research.

It is important, Chairperson, to note that the Minister did set  up  a  task
team that carried out research as well as  a  comparative  study  to  ensure
that even the most vulnerable are covered. This House must  also  note  that
last year, as the Minister correctly confirmed,  the  Bill  was  amended  to
address the  following  shortcomings:  The  weak  and  nonviable  nature  of
coverage; weak enforcement and compliance; lack of financial  sustainability
- he has given figures; the rigid benefit structure; discrimination  against
certain categories, such as pregnant women; and the lack of a  comprehensive
database.

Through the UIF task team,  there  were  recommendations  that  led  to  the
extension of UIF coverage to all workers  by  delinking  maternity  benefits
from  unemployment  benefits.  Furthermore,  the  task  team  put  in  place
progressive and graduated benefits. As you would know, those  who  are  high
earners are now subsidising those who are low earners.

Furthermore, the task team adopted the existing  structure  with  regard  to
unemployment, maternity, illness, adoption and dependence. It  also  put  in
place stricter enforcement and compliance measures with a punitive  element,
as well as  a  database.  I  must  commend  the  Department  of  Labour  for
efficiently implementing the programme. Today  we  have  a  computer  system
that is easily accessible.

Chairperson, one also has to commend the department and the  commission  for
their excellence and diligence, more so on account of  the  statistics  that
have been given. This happened at a time  when  -  I  will  give  figures  -
levels of unemployment were rising. In 1995 unemployment rose  from  16%  to
27%, and it went up to 30,5% in September 2002.

These figures also relate to some  4,8  million  people  who  were  actively
looking for work. As much as 53%  of  these  were  African  women  who  were
unemployed, of whom 75% were under 30 years. What this  means  is  that  the
provision of unemployment insurance does assist in bettering  the  lives  of
the people.

Chairperson, we are, therefore, faced with threats in this  country:  rising
unemployment, an increasing informal sector, increasing  casualisation  and,
of course, part-time workers. There is a  need  to  speedily  fine-tune  the
Unemployment Insurance Act for smooth, effective implementation.  I  do  not
have to repeat the amendments which were effected in section 1, as  the  hon
Minister has taken you through them.

Before I close off, I would like to go  to  the  DA.  If  this  was  a  work
situation, I would say Mr Redcliffe has been misplaced, because he does  not
understand the subject he's trying to address.  The  Department  of  Labour,
hon member, is structurally or such a  nature  that  its  power  is  at  the
labour centre. Services are decentralised so that they are  close  to  where
people are.

Now, I do not know if you want to argue on the basis  of  centralisation  of
that department at national office. We have  provincial  offices  that  also
rely on labour centres, which are called centres of  excellence.  I  do  not
know in what way, hon member, you see yourself working effectively.  You  do
not have manners.

So what I'm saying is that I think in  the  committee  ...  [Interjections.]
I'm not a parrot like you. So, what I'm saying, Chairperson, is that ...

... abasebenzi bamvile uMhlekazi  uMdladlana  xa  ebesithi  abona  basebenzi
basokolayo  baza  kukwazi  ukuba  baphumelele  ngale   inshorensi   ejongene
nentswelangqesho. [... workers certainly heard Mr  Mdladlana  when  he  said
that the most struggling and suffering  workers  will  be  able  to  survive
through this insurance policy that is aimed  at  catering  for  their  needs
when they are no longer in employment.]

Hape e tla kgona hore e fihlelle ho bao ba kojwana-di-mahetleng. Re  tlohele
bana ba sa tsebeng letho, ba ntseng ba re senyetsa nako mona. Ke  a  leboha.
(Translation of Sesotho paragraph follows.)

[It will also be able to reach the poor people. Let us  forget  about  these
people who do not know anything, who are just wasting our time. Thank you.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Chairperson, hon  members,  besengilahlekile  la  ngingazi
ukuthi sikhuluma ngani manje [I was lost, not knowing what  we  are  talking
about]. I have come  back  and  now  I  know  what  we  are  talking  about.
Amendments to this Unemployment Insurance Act, Act 63  of  2001,  came  into
effect on April 2002. The Minister appointed the task  team  to  investigate
and make recommendations regarding the administration of the Act in  respect
of domestic and seasonal workers.

The amending Bill must be read in conjunction with the mission statement  of
the Unemployment Insurance Fund,  which  states  that  the  UIF  strives  to
contribute to the alleviation  of  poverty  in  South  Africa  by  providing
effective short-term unemployment insurance to all workers who  qualify  for
unemployment and related benefits and  by  assisting  them  in  finding  re-
employment.

The amending Bill now being discussed today seeks to regulate the  principal
Act in respect of domestic  and  seasonal  workers.  The  amendment  further
seeks to explain how domestic workers who are  employed  by  more  than  one
employer can be accommodated by this amendment. It further seeks to  clarify
the position of a domestic worker, should an employer die and the worker  be
left without a job. It clarifies what provisions should be made in order  to
deal with such cases when the occasion arises.

The IFP, in accordance with its policy of decentralisation,  is  pleased  to
note that this amendment proposes the establishment of  regional  committees
of the board. I am glad that the Minister has acceded  to  my  request  that
such a board be established. This will serve to expedite the cases of  those
persons who are dissatisfied with the rulings of either the  claims  officer
or the unemployment insurance commissioners.

Because of the very complicated and complex situation which we inherited  in
regard to working conditions - particularly of the domestic workers  in  our
country - I believe that it  will  be  necessary,  from  time  to  time,  to
regulate the working conditions of our domestic workers.  It  will  also  be
necessary to come to this House, from time to time,  in  order  to  regulate
working conditions, not  only  in  respect  of  domestic  workers,  but  all
workers, particularly in view of the HIV epidemic.  The  IFP  supports  this
amendment to the UIF. [Applause.]

Miss T E ḼISHIVHA: Ndi a livhuwa Mudzulatshidulo na Miraḓo yoṱhe ya  Buthano
ḽa Lushaka.  [Thank  you,  Chairperson  and  all  members  of  the  National
Assembly.]

I  will  start  by  thanking  the  Minister  of  Labour  for   leading   his
department's team that engaged in an education campaign around  Pretoria  in
a train. During this campaign  pamphlets  were  distributed,  outlining  the
registration  of  domestic  workers  and  all  matters   relating   to   the
Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.  People   were   also   taken   through   the
registration process. We want to thank the ANC-led Government  for  bringing
about all these developments, to change the lives of ordinary workers.

The UIF Bill is  part  of  the  poverty  alleviation  of  domestic  workers,
whether they are unemployed, on maternity leave or sick. This Bill  provides
a change from  the  apartheid  UIF,  which  did  not  cater  for  women.  In
addition, this Bill provides an increase of unemployment days  from  180  to
238 days.

[Tshifhinga  tsho  fhela.]  [U  fhululedza.]   (Translation   of   Tshivenḓa
paragraphs follows.)

[By law, each and every worker who works more than 24 hours  per  month  has
the right to be registered. The truth is that there is  a  better  life  for
all.

Both the worker and the employer have to contribute 1%  each.  The  employer
must see to it that he or she pays that money  before  the  seventh  day  of
each and every month. Those who do not care about the lives of  people  feel
as if they are being ripped off. When you look at  the  ANC-led  Government,
you will notice how it  differs  from  the  previous  dispensation.  At  the
moment, this legislation makes it possible for the  poverty-stricken  people
to get adequate money should they not be working.

Domestic workers must see to it that their employers register  them  because
they have that right. An employee must go  to  the  nearest  office  to  get
registered, if the employer has not done so on his or her behalf. There  are
numerous offices of the Department of Labour in our provinces. Moreover,  we
also have the sectoral determination which takes care of farmers.  It  shows
farmers the conditions under which farmworkers must work, as well  as  their
minimum wage. It also includes conditions for domestic workers and  security
guards. Farmworkers now have a minimum  wage.  This  is  making  history  in
South Africa because this is the first time this is happening. This  is  all
because of the ANC.

Farmworkers must be remunerated according to the  hours  they  have  worked.
But people must take into consideration that farmworkers are paid  according
to the areas in which they work, because they are different. We have area  A
and area B. This shows us that our municipalities are not equal. Area  A  is
around cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town, whereas area B comprises  all
our municipalities. People should listen attentively:  There  are  no  areas
where people are supposed to be evicted. This is  promoting  a  better  life
for all.

Farmworkers who work more than 27 hours per week get a minimum wage of  R800
per month in area A, whereas in area B they get R650 per  month.  There  are
people who work less than 27 hours per week. These  workers  get  R4,10  per
hour in area A, whereas  in  area  B  they  get  R3,33  per  hour.  This  is
something new to the farmworkers and it has been  implemented  by  the  ANC,
which is the Government for the people.

The employer must deduct money from the employee's salary according  to  the
agreement in order to pay for the organisations for workers. We  must  teach
these workers that there is money which is not supposed to be deducted  from
their salaries, such as money for uniforms, overalls, security and the  food
that  they  eat  when  they  are  working.  When  employees  pay  for  their
accommodation, the employers must see to it that the  roof  is  not  leaking
and that there is water, electricity  and  toilets.  The  ANC  is  concerned
about the good health of all people. That is why we say: A better  life  for
all.

Workers must be paid for overtime, or when working on  public  holidays  and
Sundays. Farmworkers must get vacation leave too. We know  that  because  of
all these changes farmers are not happy. Some of them  are  even  dismissing
their employees. When the employer dismisses an employee,  he  or  she  must
give him or her notice. An employee must be  paid  for  working  during  the
notice period. An employer must issue an  employee  with  a  certificate  of
service after completion of the notice period.

According to the Department of Labour, a  sectoral  determination  does  not
allow a child who is under the age of 15 years to work.  The  ANC  is  doing
all this so that people can be liberated from the previous bondage. That  is
why the Minister indicated that people will be  monitored  if  they  do  not
comply with the new legislation. There is a penalty which  has  to  be  paid
when people do not comply with the legislation. For example, the  inspectors
of the Department of Labour have visited  five  provinces,  namely  KwaZulu-
Natal, Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape.  They  visited
1 600 employers  and  discovered  that  only  25%  are  complying  with  the
legislation. At the  present  moment,  we  have  560  000  people  who  have
registered their employees. We also have 430 000 people whose data has  been
captured on the computers.

This is an enormous task which the  Department  of  Labour  is  engaged  in.
According to the  ANC,  all  South  African  citizens  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]]

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, this Bill seeks to further rectify a problem  that
has been in existence for hundreds of years. There is no  doubt  that  there
will always be a tiny segment of people whose aim will  be  to  oppose  such
remedial measures as defined in this amendment,  and  their  criticism  will
remain without any foundation.

In short this Bill deals with some  administrative  issues  of  a  technical
nature to ensure that domestic workers who work for more than  one  employer
do not suffer adversely if they lose one or more jobs,  even  if  that  loss
comes about due to the death of their employer.

This Bill again considers the matter of simplifying  and  bringing  services
closer to the people by establishing provincial committees that will  manage
all appeals, instead of centralising the  process  in  Pretoria.  This  Bill
further empowers  the  Minister  to  appoint  this  committee  in  terms  of
objective criteria. The question that arises  is:  Should  the  new  New  NP
support or reject this amendment?

The Commissioner of the UIF has shown  a  clear  commitment  to  better  the
lives of one of the most vulnerable sectors of society. Again we need to  be
realistic when we debate this issue. The overwhelming majority  of  domestic
workers are black women and  they  are  very  vulnerable.  In  our  view  if
anybody opposes this Bill or the actions of the Minister, it would be  based
on racism  in  that  they  do  not  wish  these  vulnerable  workers  to  be
protected. In any event the wish will remain just that, a wish.

The reality is that this Bill  is  supported  by  all  people  of  goodwill.
Furthermore, the decentralisation of  the  appeals  committee  is  a  direct
indication that no one should take any statements  seriously  that  warn  of
centralisation. Such warnings remind  me  of  the  so-called  swart  gevaar.
Today we hear strident calls of a one-party  state.  How  can  any  sensible
person believe that, when decentralisation is the order of the day.  I  take
the train of thought further, that any scaremongering  about  centralisation
is nothing more than a senseless political ploy designed to  undermine  this
democracy and divide our society along racial lines. This Bill clearly  sets
out a process of decentralisation. Of course,  the  New  NP  fully  supports
this Bill.

A very significant factor is the  recognition  of  the  fact  that  domestic
workers can and may  be  partially  employed.  This  definition  allows  the
partially employed, who are exposed to all sorts of problems, to be able  to
claim part compensation from that fund, thereby  causing  the  circumstances
of the worker not to be worse than  they  were  when  they  were  previously
fully employed.

This Bill therefore makes provision for domestic workers with more than  one
employer to be accommodated and provides for the payment of  benefits  under
certain specified conditions. This Bill also makes  provision  for  domestic
workers who are entitled to obtain unemployment benefits where the  employer
or contributor dies. It is envisaged  that  this  claim  could  be  honoured
within 48 hours and that is very encouraging. Thank you. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF is one of the  most  delighted  parties
over the focus on labour rights for domestic  and  seasonal  workers.  These
exploited trades require representation earnestly.

Domestic labour is often exploited to  the  depths  comparable  to  slavery,
which is a major contravention  of  the  human  rights  that  our  democracy
tirelessly works to uphold. Low wages, poor  working  conditions,  exposure,
burdensome hours and vast definitions of duties  see  many  poverty-stricken
persons slaving for hours to earn a living. Provisions introduced to  manage
these have been most liberating. However, it is hoped that the employers  of
domestic and seasonal workers will respect the law, and the  earnest  method
to ensure adherence to these must be firmly inculcated.

In view of the Unemployment  Insurance  Amendment  Bill  the  MF  finds  the
provisions made in  this  document  in  respect  of  domestic  and  seasonal
workers adequate. It is, however, hoped that a balance between the  employer
and the employee's rights will be maintained, so that no one party may  feel
that their rights are being undermined. The  MF  supports  the  Unemployment
Insurance Amendment Bill. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Mr Chairperson,  my  dear  friend  the  hon  Redcliffe  is
certainly living in a dream world. I must tell you, the  Minister  has  just
shown you an  award  ...  [Interjections.]  It  does  not  matter!  Somebody
appreciates him and his department very much.  He  is  a  very,  very  hard-
working individual and so is his department.

You say the man lives in an ivory tower and does not work. Not so  long  ago
the director-general came  to  the  portfolio  committee  with  an  in-depth
presentation about the problems and the restructuring of the department,  as
well as how the department now operates, which we all -  including  yourself
- had great appreciation for.

The commissioner came not so long ago and explained to you why we are  going
to have these amendments.  They  are  meant  to  speed  up  the  process  of
delivery. Now you had one case for which you probably waited for 11  months,
as you claim. However, one wonders how much truth  there  is  in  that.  You
must go to the area; there are labour centres right  across  Cape  Town  and
right across South Africa. If you want to,  you  can  come  to  the  one  in
Atlantis. We will show you how effective we and the department are.

It certainly does work, because part of  our  work  as  parliamentarians  is
also to do oversight work. But it is clear that you are not doing  so,  that
is why you do not know that these centres are working.  And  they  explained
to us on numerous occasions but you just refuse to  listen,  you  refuse  to
understand. Maybe at some point your  party  must  train  you  in  order  to
understand how the issues are dealt with in our department.

I am not going to repeat all the things that everybody has said  because  we
spoke about the whole question of the appeals committee and the question  of
the rights of domestic workers and farmworkers. There is one clear issue  in
this amendment that really goes to my heart, and I just  want  to  tell  all
those employees of domestic workers: Please register your domestic  workers,
because the law  is  so  effective  now  that  if  you  die,  your  employee
immediately enjoys unemployment insurance benefits. And that  is  important.
In the past when an employer died the individual employee  was  simply  lost
and there was no assistance for this particular person.

I think that is the kind of effect,  hon  Redcliffe,  that  this  particular
Minister and the department are giving to the people and the  lives  of  our
communities. I think when we really speak about pushing back  the  frontiers
of poverty this is what in fact we are saying. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, the hon member from the  DA  says  that
we are living in ivory towers. The unfortunate thing is  that  he  has  only
referred to one  or  two  people.  I  have  conducted  imbizos  in  all  the
provinces of the country, and I am continuing to  do  so,  because  I  don't
live in an ivory tower like him. I don't know  what  has  happened  to  him,
because he is such a ... - let me not use the word. [Laughter.]

If you are aware of any person who is arrogant and silly in  the  Department
of Labour as you say, I want the name of that person  before  I  leave  this
House today. I want to know the address of that labour centre that  you  are
talking about, because  I  am  not  the  Minister  of  Labour  for  nothing.
Remember, you are talking to a former principal of a school  who  knows  how
to deal with ill- discipline, not like that man who is sitting over there.

Secondly, it is very important that I say  to  the  hon  members  that  this
department  is  continuously  being  nominated  as  part  of  the  top   300
companies. We are not a company, we are the Department  of  Labour,  but  we
are continuously being nominated as part of the 300 top  companies  in  this
country, because of our performance on the ground. [Applause.]

It can only happen if you belong to the  ANC.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]
That is precisely why it is  very  important  that  people  understand  that
those who oppose the ANC are opposed to  democracy.  [Applause.]  Those  who
are opposed to the ANC are opposed to nonsexism in this country.  Those  who
are opposed to the ANC are opposed  to  employment  equity.  Those  who  are
opposed to the ANC are opposed to  skills  development,  what  we  call  the
skills revolution, in this country. So, watch out when you  are  saying  you
are opposing the ANC, because it means you are opposing the majority of  the
people of this country, 40 million of whom happen to be black. [Applause.]

The gentleman who was talking here happens to be a  black  man  as  well.  I
don't know why he is opposed to a party  of  this  nature,  the  ANC,  which
incidentally was established in 1912. Hon  member,  we  have  more  than  90
years of experience in resistance, and we will continue to  resist  you  and
your opposition to the transformation of this country. We will  fight  tooth
and nail to make sure that we  better  the  lives  of  the  people  of  this
country. [Interjections.] Your mouth is so big that the members  of  the  DA
out there ... [Interjections.] It is because of your noise that I am  saying
these things, so that you can keep your  members  quiet.  You  must  die  in
peace, so that you should become a ``Death  Alliance''  indeed.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

I want to thank the hon members who are supporting  this  Bill  -  including
the DA, by the way, even though they say that we  should  scrap  the  Labour
Relations Act. This is the Labour Relations Act, and yet you are  saying  it
must be scrapped. You are saying scrap Nedlac. Today, I don't know,  because
you have supported the previous amendments, and  you  are  again  supporting
this amendment. Why do you go  outside  and  shout  the  opposite,  and  say
``Scrap the Labour  Relations  Act?''  What  else  are  you  offering  after
scrapping the Labour Relations Act? Nothing, my  dear  friend.  But  anyway,
thank you very much. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                      SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF LABOUR:  Ndiyaphangela  namhlanje.  [I  am  working  today.]
Chairperson and hon members, I am deeply grateful  for  the  opportunity  to
place  before  this  House  the  Skills  Development  Amendment   Bill   for
consideration and adoption. It is the first  time  that  I  am  asking  this
august House to amend this piece of legislation that was passed in 1998.

In the five years that have passed since then, literally millions of  people
have been trained under its banner. Many  of  these  people  have  been  the
workers who keep our economy running in all the mines,  offices,  shops  and
factories of our nation. With the training they  have  received  we  believe
that the productivity and competitiveness of their workplaces,  as  well  as
our own employment security and prospects, have been improved.

In addition, hundreds of thousands of  unemployed  people,  young  and  old,
have also been trained to find work in the formal labour market,  to  create
their  own  income-generating  opportunity  and  to  participate  in  social
development projects. The aim is to improve the lives of  their  communities
and the households that  constitute  it.  The  skills  revolution  that  the
legislation was intended to unleash is indeed well underway.  The  amendment
sets out to remedy the challenges that have had to be faced in  the  process
of implementation.

Whilst many of the achievements that I have just alluded to are the  product
of hard work on the part of  many  of  the  Sector  Education  and  Training
Authorities or Setas, as they are called, it is a matter  of  public  record
that some of the Setas have not worked  well.  Allies  and  opponents  alike
have forcefully brought the problems to the public's attention because  they
are concerned to  see  every  cent  collected  under  the  skills  levy  for
training delivery being spent properly  and  certainly,  not  wastefully  or
fraudulently. I agree completely with this view.

It has been patently painful for me to watch, with paralysis, incidences  of
poor  performance,  inadequate  accountability  and   in   some   instances,
financial impropriety. In a country where the rule of law reigns supreme,  I
can only exercise powers which have been conferred on me  by  the  law.  The
current law does not allow me to adequately intervene  and  address  matters
that many of  you  have  correctly  complained  about  in  relation  to  the
operation of the Setas.

My first response was to highlight  this  problem  to  our  social  partners
whose representatives  sit  on  governing  boards  of  these  Setas.  I  was
thrilled when the social  partners  accepted  the  challenge  and  made  the
commitments they  did  at  the  Growth  and  Development  Summit.  You  will
remember that both business and labour said  that  they  would  ensure  that
their representatives to the  Seta  boards  are  at  a  sufficiently  senior
level, in order  to  be  able  to  take  meaningful  decisions  and  provide
strategic direction.  They  would  also  ensure  that  they  are  adequately
prepared for this responsibility. Hopefully, in future they  will  stand  to
account when problems arise. I will not have to take the heat  alone.  After
all, I do not sit on the board of any of the Setas.

However, I must accept that ensuring  that  the  objectives  of  the  Skills
Development Act are achieved is my  responsibility.  And,  in  summary,  the
central reason for the amendments is to give me the right  to  fix  problems
that have arisen so that the skills revolution can accelerate apace  without
being drawn back by the negative publicity that applies.

When considering the changes to the law I had a choice: I could  attempt  to
remedy  each  and  every  problem  as  it  arose  or  I  could  clarify   my
expectations of good, efficient performance and transformatory practice  for
all Setas, and then put in place procedures to  target  those  who  deviated
from this. I have chosen the latter. I felt that  the  former  course  would
lead to an ad hoc set of prescriptions which  would  increasingly  skew  the
playing  field  in  ways  that  would  eventually  undermine  the  universal
training agenda we are trying to put in place.

So you will see, hon members, in these amendments a new  obligation  on  all
Setas to enter service level agreements with the Department of  Labour  that
clearly set out performance outcomes and very clear step,  should  any  Seta
fail to meet its obligations in terms of these agreements.  For  example,  I
shall have power to instruct Setas to remedy a problem and if they  fail  to
do so, then this will itself constitute grounds for the  takeover  of  their
administration.

Some feel, I know, that giving me the power to set salaries  for  staff  and
allowances for board members is  going  too  far.  They  feel  that  is  the
board's responsibility. The need for intervention arose  in  response  to  a
public outcry about these matters, where the Seta boards were the  authority
to set reasonable standards in this regard from March 2000, but have  failed
to do so.

However, those who are concerned that I  will  exercise  this  power  in  an
arbitrary way that interferes with the performance of Setas need not  worry.
It is precisely in order to promote the  performance  or  Setas  that  I  am
introducing these measures, and so a fair balance will be found following  a
fair and transparent process.

There are other challenges in the Skills  Development  Act  that  have  been
occasioned  by  other  implementation  problems.  In   regard   to   private
employment agencies, for example, there are those of you in this  House  who
will recall the case that was highlighted in the media  last  year.  It  was
found in this case that young women were  being  recruited  by  unscrupulous
private employment agencies  from  the  rural  areas  with  the  promise  of
domestic work here in Cape Town.

They were ferried to town in taxis that they  were  later  expected  to  pay
for, kept in barrack-like conditions and then hired  out  at  extremely  low
rates of pay. Most of  the  agencies  engaged  in  this  practice  were  not
registered  with  the  Department  of  Labour,  but   ambiguities   in   the
legislation made it unnecessarily difficult to close them down.

The proposed amendments put the matter beyond doubt. All private  employment
agencies will be expected to be registered and will only  be  registered  if
they comply to decent work practices. Failure  to  do  so  will  undoubtedly
lead to their closure. I salute  those  in  the  private  sector  employment
agency  industry  who  have  supported  this  measure,  demonstrating  their
commitment to clean up this industry.

The  other  positive  measure  that  these  amendments  are  introducing  is
Employment and Skills Development Agencies. These agencies are  intended  to
accelerate the uptake of learners in learnerships  by  taking  from  smaller
employers,  and  even  nongovernmental  agencies,  all  the  hassle  of  the
administration side of learnerships. There will be no reason  for  any  firm
not to take on learners after this amendment.

Indeed, I support the call of  the  National  Youth  Commission  that  every
single employer should have at least one learner. Only on  this  scale  will
we be able to achieve both our growth  and  development  target  of  72  000
learners by May next year  and  the  national  skills  development  strategy
target of 80 000 by March 2005.

I trust that the hon members who are committed  to  the  objectives  of  the
skills revolution will support  these  amendments  and  also  do  their  bit
within their spheres of influence  to  ensure  that  our  skills  revolution
becomes a resounding success. Enkosi. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Chairperson, the  legislative  amendments  to  the  Skills
Development Amendment Bill deal by and largely  with  the  Sector  Education
and Training Authorities. I, therefore, will be focusing my remarks  largely
on the Setas, because most of the substantive amendments deal with them.

The DA has always been very critical of them Setas and we are on  record  as
asking that  they  be  scrapped.  We  have  said  that  they  are  wasteful,
overbureaucratic and ineffective. In our experience we have  found  them  to
be self-serving, with the people involved earning  exorbitant  salaries  and
with equally big egos. I know  the  Minister  himself  has  also  been  very
critical and shares the same concerns, and he said so today as well.

We, on this side of the House, have warned repeatedly about  these  concerns
since the inception of the Setas three years ago. This is the result if  one
implements such overbureaucratic institutions. This country  does  not  have
the luxury of engaging in elaborate schemes. It is important  that  what  we
do, we do right the first time. We do not need to reinvent the wheel.

The DA shares the Government's deep concern that the  poor  skills  base  on
our country inhibits our competitiveness. Skills development should enjoy  a
very high priority in South Africa. Without it, our  economic  growth  would
be stunted and millions of our people would struggle to find employment.

Central to the amendments is the  intention  to  strengthen  the  Minister's
powers to influence the work of the  Setas  and  to  hold  them  to  tighter
account. The rationale for the Minister is to intervene  decisively  in  the
operations of these Setas because of  their  ineffectiveness.  But  the  hon
Minister  may  find  out  that  each  intervention   will   create   further
distortions, which in turn will spawn a need for further new  interventions.
After putting his fingers  into  25  pies,  he  may  find  it  difficult  to
extricate himself. He may just have to plug one hole after  the  other.  For
his sake, we sincerely hope this will not be the case.

A few months ago we looked at  the  example  of  the  construction  industry
Seta.  Two-thirds  of  employees  work  for  builders  with  fewer  than  20
employees, and 87% work for builders with fewer than 50 employees. It  takes
a person five days of training to learn how  to  fill  in  the  Seta  forms.
Money is paid out to appoint facilitators  and  submit  plans  and  reports,
even if no training has taken place.

In its nearly three years of existence the construction  industry  Seta  has
collected over R200 million from its members. Not one learnership  has  been
entered  into  the  building  industry  which  would   lead   to   a   trade
qualification. Of 11 000 employees, only about 400 have submitted  workplace
skills plans,  of  which  about  260  have  been  approved.  Many  employers
consider that the  work  required  and  the  bureaucratic  obstacles  to  be
surmounted are not worth it for the refunds obtained.

We can mention other examples of nonperformance. Suffice it to say, most  of
the Setas, particularly those in the public sector, are the guilty ones.

Although the DA will not oppose the Skills Development  Amendment  Bill,  it
is  not  true  that  we  did  not  express  our  reservations   during   the
deliberations in the portfolio committee, as was suggested by  the  Minister
during his parliamentary briefing last week.  In  fact,  we  proposed  three
amendments to the Bill in the portfolio committee  and  all  of  these  were
rejected.

The Skills Development Amendment Bill is characterised by a high  degree  of
intervention by  the  Minister  in  what  should  be  purely  administrative
actions, which should fall within the domain of the director-general as  the
accounting officer. This is particularly true in respect of clause 9,  which
amends section 14 of the principal Act.

The amendment essentially prescribes the total expenditure that a  Seta  may
make on its administration; the amount that a Seta may spend on  any  aspect
of its administration; salary bands within  which  categories  of  employees
must be remunerated;  the  conditions  under  which  employees  may  receive
performance-related payments and the maximum payment that may be made to  an
employee in this regard, etc.

All these, I submit, are of an administrative nature. This also  applies  to
clause 10 in the Bill. The DA will monitor the Setas on an  on-going  basis.
We  simply  cannot  wait  for   another   few   years   to   determine   its
ineffectiveness. For the moment, we are giving the Minister the  benefit  of
the doubt and we will not oppose the Bill.

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Thank you, Deputy Chair. We have tried our  best  in  the
portfolio committee to educate the member  Redcliffe,  but  we  have  failed
dismally. He says that the DA is concerned about the shortage of  skills  in
the country, but at the same  time  he  talks  about  scrapping  the  Setas.
Unfortunately, this is not how we deal with things as the  ANC.  We  do  not
scrap something before we have identified a remedy.

The amendments before us today  are,  once  more,  efforts  by  the  ANC-led
Government to address the legacy of the past regime. The ANC  is  supporting
these amendments because they are about  ensuring  that  we  strengthen  and
speed up the implementation of the Skills Development Act. The proposal  for
these amendments is informed by the oversight work that we do.

Reports on the work  of  the  Setas  as  well  as  the  public  hearings  on
employment equity held by the portfolio committee indicate  that  unless  we
make this intervention we will not achieve the  objectives  and  targets  we
have set ourselves as a nation with regard  to  the  skills  revolution  and
equity in the workplace. The concern that has  been  raised  at  the  public
hearings is that there is no link between the  Skills  Development  Act  and
employment equity to prevent employers,  when  addressing  the  question  of
equity, from saying that they can't find suitable people.
In this debate, therefore, I want to share with the members the contents  of
the Employment Equity Registry Report and the  National  Skills  Development
Strategy Implementation Report, both of 2001 and 2002.  I  will  also  share
with you some of the good work that is  done  through  the  National  Skills
Fund.

Let me remind members that the objective of the Skills  Development  Act  is
to equip South  Africans,  those  in  employment,  those  seeking  to  enter
employment, as well as communities in our country, with skills. In order  to
achieve this, we had to put in place a framework  that  included  the  Setas
driving  the  learnerships,  the  National  Skills  Authority  advising  the
department,  and  the  funding  of  strategic  Government   projects   aimed
especially at those outside of the world of work from  the  National  Skills
Fund through an allocation of 20% of the levies.

The Employment Equity Report reflects that 77% of all employees  are  black.
However, blacks represent only 25%  of  all  employees  in  top  management,
which is unacceptable. Women represent 35% of all employees,  yet  only  12%
of them are in top management -  also  unacceptable.  Only  1%  of  disabled
people are represented at different levels  of  management,  which  is  very
unacceptable.

The ANC is serious about addressing these inequities in the  workplace.  The
report indicates that the shortage of skills among these  designated  groups
is one of the barriers to achieving equity.  Employers  ask:  "Where  do  we
find skilled people in these categories?" The report also  reflects  on  the
representation of women in the various staff levels of the various Setas.

What is important  to  note  about  this  report  is  that  women  are  best
represented in the health and welfare Setas;  they  make  up  about  76%  of
staff. However,  they  are  worst  represented  in  the  following  sectors:
transport, energy, construction  and  mining.  Their  representation  ranges
between 3% and 8%.

This situation cannot be correct, because it means that  women  will  remain
in the health and welfare sectors as nurses and social  workers,  while  men
become  engineers,  technicians,  construction  company  owners  and  mining
bosses. The ANC will not allow this, and therefore welcomes amendments  that
address equity within the governing bodies and staff of the  Setas,  because
we believe that if we correct the situation in  the  Setas  first,  then  we
will be in a better position to deliver equity.

Again, without going into the details of the implementation  report  on  the
skills strategy, let me state that it reflects not only that the picture  is
balanced, but that there are challenges to all those concerned about  skills
development  in  our  country.  Of  the  five  objectives  outlined  in  the
strategy, the most worrying for the ANC  is  the  one  about  assisting  new
entrants into employment.

The labour force survey of 2001 indicated that 72% of the youth between  the
ages of 16 and 34 are struggling to  make  the  transition  to  work.  Youth
unemployment is a critical  issue  facing  our  country  and  therefore  the
achievement of the objective of assisting new entrants  into  employment  is
essential.

Lastly, I want to reflect on some of the projects that are funded  from  the
National  Skills  Fund.  These  projects  aim  to  develop   skills   within
vulnerable sectors, such as domestic workers, taxi and  fishing  industries,
emerging and subsistence  farmers,  ex-mineworkers  and  retrenched  workers
from defence who are disabled.

The  ANC  believes  that  the  proposal  to  dedicate  a  portion   of   the
administration to the fund will enable the fund to  be  more  effective  and
indeed assist in pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty,  especially  among
those who are not in employment. The ANC is not only concerned  about  those
who earn a salary by being in employment, but also those who aspire to  earn
a living through employment or self-employment.

We believe, therefore, that these amendments are critical to addressing  the
problems of inequity, skills shortage and unemployment,  as  discussed.  The
ANC supports these amendments. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Hon Chairman, hon members, the Skills Development  Act  of
1998 sought to create a framework for improving  the  skills  of  the  South
African workforce. The Minister of Labour, in one of  his  messages  to  the
National Skills Development Strategy, once said: "If you  are  not  part  of
the solution, then you are  part  of  the  problem."  Uyakhumbula?  [Do  you
remember?] [Interjections.] Okay.

When skills development  was  introduced,  resulting  in  the  formation  of
various Setas, it was with the  main  purpose  of  training  and  developing
properly skilled and properly trained workers. It  is  unfortunate,  as  the
Minister has stated, that some of  the  Setas  have  not  performed  as  was
expected of them. It is for this reason,  amongst  many  others,  that  this
amending Bill now seeks to give more powers to  the  Minister  in  order  to
respond positively to all these problems experienced through Setas  that  do
not perform as expected, and for the purpose for which they were formed.

In accordance with these proposed amendments, the Minister may intervene  in
cases of management  and  accountability  of  any  Seta.  By  improving  the
operations of the Setas, the amending Bill further empowers the Minister  to
establish and promote  good  practice  in  skills  development.  It  further
extends the Minister's power to make regulations. Generally, this  amendment
gives the Minister powers to change the composition of the  National  Skills
Authority.

The IFP further wishes to request the  Minister  to  urgently  look  at  the
possibility of mergers in some of these Setas. Some of these Setas  seem  to
be duplicating their work.

The IFP welcomes the fact that this amendment now  clears  the  question  of
dealing with the unscrupulous private employment  agencies,  in  particular,
that  are  abusing  their  status.  Such  agencies  should   not   only   be
deregistered, but should be closed down completely.

Just a few days ago, Mr Minister, a couple was arrested for  corruption  and
for operating an illegal employment agency here in Cape  Town.  This  agency
is alleged to have charged unemployed people a fee of R270 in return  for  a
job. It was estimated that over 3 000 residents in the area of  Kuyasa  near
Khayelitsha  were  registered.  The  amendment  proposed  in  this  Bill  is
therefore appreciated for just such unscrupulous agencies. The IFP  supports
this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr R M MOROPA: Chairperson, Minister, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,  I
also rise to join the queue in telling the people of South Africa the  truth
about our success during  the  first  10  years  of  political  freedom  and
democracy, and to counteract the negative  propaganda  that  South  Africa's
first democratic Government has failed to  deliver  on  its  manifesto  -  a
false claim predicated on the theory of white  supremacy,  an  ill-conceived
notion that South Africa is in a worse situation today than it was 10  years
ago.

This, when we managed to establish and operationalise  25  Sector  Education
and Training Authorities in less than two  years  and  when  no  fewer  than
23 513 learners were admitted to learnership schemes  during  the  2002  and
2003 financial years. Despite all these and other giant  strides  made,  our
detractors conveniently elect to see  a  black  Government  that  cannot  do
anything plausible.

South Africa has been undergoing a  profound  socioeconomic  transformation,
with the  old  undemocratic  apartheid  institutions  being  dismantled  and
replaced  with  egalitarian  and  democratic  state  institutions.  On   the
economic front, these changes took the  form  of  structural  transformation
and reform, implying a movement away from activities based  in  the  primary
sector of agriculture and mining towards more knowledge-based secondary  and
tertiary sector activities, with far-reaching  implications  for  employment
patterns and the type of skills that are in demand.

We all know the reasons for the slowing down of these economic changes.  The
past institutionalised racial discrimination,  particularly  the  denial  of
access to quality education for the vast  majority  of  the  population,  is
responsible for these economic and labour market inequalities.

It is against this backdrop that the Skills Development  Amendment  Bill  is
being  introduced  to  the  House  today  as  a  contribution  towards   the
attainment of an elusive  balance  between  skills  demanded  by  the  ever-
modernising economy and the availability of matching human capital. The  ANC
understands the consequences of a low skills base in  a  global  economy  in
which competition transcends  national  boundaries  and  capital  flows  are
highly mobile. We understand  very  well  that  South  Africa's  competitive
position is mainly determined by the quality of its human capital.

This honest account marks both the end of 10 years of sustained  improvement
in skills service delivery and the beginning of a renewed commitment to  the
vision  of  a  better  life  for  all  South  Africans.   This   legislative
intervention confirms the determination of the ANC in the current  strategic
goal of the national reconstruction and development of our society, for  the
eradication of economic exclusion and marginalisation of the  vast  majority
of South African citizens.

There is nothing draconian in this amending Bill tabled  before  this  House
today, as has been noted by the opposition. However, what  is  contained  in
this Bill, like its predecessor, is a demonstration of our  firm  commitment
to tackling the hostile legacy of institutionalised racism we  inherited  in
1994. These proposed amendments provide us with a legislative  framework  in
the building and activation of the campaign of the broad national front  for
robust national skills development to  reduce  the  number  of  unemployable
people by raising the skills level of the masses of our people.

A memorandum of understanding, which was  used  as  an  interim  measure  to
assess  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  Setas  in  the  absence  of   a
legislative provision, will now give way  to  the  service  level  agreement
clause, as proposed in the Bill.  This  provision  gives  the  Minister  the
power to issue an instruction to a  Seta  if  it  has  failed  to  meet  its
obligations under the service level  agreement.  The  Bill  deals  with  the
arrangements and procedure to be followed in the event that the Minister  is
required to issue an instruction to a Seta, and it is compulsory  for  Setas
to enter into such agreements.

The ANC, in its 1999 election manifesto, declared openly  that  where  there
were blockages to change, we would remove them; where  there  was  laziness,
wastage and lack of focus, we would intervene with determination. And,  with
this Bill, these words are translated into action.

We feel strongly that the amendment put forward  for  consideration  on  the
basis that the  Minister  is  politically  accountable  for  the  successful
implementation of this Act and must, equally, be equipped  with  regulation-
making powers to regulate when he deems necessary, is a provision that  must
be supported and approved.

In strengthening the Act, the amending Bill makes  it  obligatory  for  each
Seta to address the most important issue of equity  in  both  its  governing
bodies and its staff composition. In support of this  proposal  we  want  to
add further that it must be equally obligatory for any new  Seta  to  comply
with  this  clause  at  its  inception,  and  those   that   are   currently
contravening this clause must immediately embark on a redress.

Also worth mentioning is that the Act at present does not give the  Minister
the power to effect the merger of Setas, or to change their scope of  cover.
The proposed amendment rectifies this position.  However,  it  requires  the
Minister to  seek  the  advice  of  the  National  Skills  Authority  before
exercising these new powers.

The clause on the intermediate agency for learnerships seeks to introduce  a
new concept and will allow an employer to contract  a  dedicated  agency  to
perform  the  functions  of  the  employer  in  learnership  agreements  and
contracts of employment. This is introduced in order to enable  small  firms
and even nongovernmental organisations to take on  learners  without  having
to take on the administrative functions associated  with  learnerships.  The
amendment also empowers the Minister to regulate this relationship,  in  the
hope that this will increase the number of  learnerships  in  aggregate  and
encourage small firms to develop a culture of lifelong learning.

Whilst there has always been an obligation for private  employment  agencies
to register with the Department of Labour, there  has,  however,  been  some
confusion about the power  to  deregister  unscrupulous  private  employment
agencies and to compel them to close down. This matter is now  clarified  in
this Bill.

In conclusion, the Bill being introduced here has been  through  a  rigorous
debating and pruning process after public inputs  and  comments  were  taken
into account. The ANC supports these amendments, because  they  are  crucial
in the fast-tracking of national skills  distribution  towards  meeting  the
needs of the economy and our new democratic order. On behalf of the ANC,  we
call on all socioeconomic progressive formations to join  us  in  the  broad
democratic front  to  speed  up  the  journey  to  a  life  of  dignity  and
fulfilment for all through the skills revolution. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY: Madam Speaker, unemployment, poverty, HIV/Aids, crime, and  the
lack of housing and skills are some of the major problems  that  plague  our
country.

The  uneven  distribution  of  middle  management,  senior  management   and
executive management positions and appointments is another major  cause  for
concern. The Setas are necessary and  should  be  used  to  deal  with  this
problem. As indicated in the introduction, the Skills Development  Amendment
Bill is designed to enable the Minister to deal in part  with  unemployment,
therefore the New NP supports this Bill.

Most social organisations, people, economic entities and  political  parties
agree that the issues I outlined in  my  introduction  are  problematic  and
need our urgent attention. Yet,  when  the  Minister  introduces  this  Bill
certain vested interests that revel in slave labour and right-wing  leanings
immediately complain about the amendments and the existence of the Setas.  I
take delight in knowing that no matter what ideas  and  plans  those  right-
wingers may have, they will not prevent the passing  and  implementation  of
this critical Bill. Essentially, no amount of chicanery  will  deflect  from
the validity and desirability of this Bill.

This Bill explains what "designated groups" means. It  also  places  certain
obligations on private employment service agencies,  and  rectifies  several
problems associated with the composition, duties,  obligations,  functioning
and accountability  of  the  Setas.  It  further  brings  clarity  into  the
relationship between the director-general and the Setas, and that,  too,  is
most welcome. Some Setas are not performing their tasks and, quite  frankly,
deserve to be shut down.

The textile Seta has  made  huge  strides  and  is  one  that  needs  to  be
congratulated. If a Seta is unable or unwilling  to  assist  in  the  skills
development process,  reduce  unemployment  in  its  sector  and  act  as  a
catalyst to empower members of the  designated  groups,  then  the  Minister
should enthusiastically close them down  or  instruct  them  to  merge  with
another Seta.

The director-general will be pleased to note that I do not have time  to  go
into an analysis of each Seta. However, I have completed that  analysis  and
synthesis, and I will interact with him in another  forum  in  that  regard.
Nevertheless, section 14  is  very  significant  and  it  is  an  instrument
designed to bring order into the internal processes of the Setas.

I need to remind the House that this amendment is designed  to  rectify  the
inhuman and discriminatory practices of the past. Last year I listened to  a
certain person who said that we should forget about the  past,  that  people
of today are  not  interested  in  what  happened.  That  is  a  lie.  I  am
interested in the past and so are millions of us. Those that benefited  from
the past will seek to spread a lie, cause general  confusion  and  propagate
that the past  is  not  important.  I  wonder  how  many  remember  the  Job
Reservation Act and how many wish we could all forget it. We  will  remember
it.

These amendments are absolutely essential, and the New NP will  continue  to
support them and their implementation. I urge the Minister  to  ensure  that
these amendments are implemented without delay as their implementation  will
provide more safeguards for ordinary people, especially from the  designated
groups. It is time that the Setas became more accountable in every respect.

As we move closer to 10 years of  democracy,  this  Bill  should  act  as  a
catalyst to remedy some matters that prevented the  Setas  from  functioning
effectively. Certainly, every Seta that functions  well  creates  employment
opportunities and reduces poverty. This is an excellent Bill  that  is  long
overdue. Thank you. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam  Speaker,  the  MF  supports  the  strengthening  and
supporting amendments this Bill gives to the implementation  of  the  Skills
Development Act.

A further proposed amendment in relation  to  Setas  is  the  service  level
agreements which are deemed necessary for efficient delivery.  There  is  no
objection to the clarity given to the Minister's regulatory powers  as  this
will provide for a  determined  definition  of  duties.  In  light  of  Seta
administration funds and the salaries of board members, the MF is  confident
that the Minister will be equitable in his direction.

Hon Minister, the MF applauds your interest in improving the  lives  of  our
people in skills development, which is directly in  line  with  vukuzenzele.
The provisions made in respect of equity  and  performance  are  encouraging
and  beneficial.  The  involvement  of  the  National  Skills  Authority  is
pleasing.  Further  amendments  regarding  Setas  all  appear   intact.   No
objection is posed to the 2% funding of the administration of  the  National
Skills Fund.

The MF therefore supports the Skills Development Amendment Bill. Thank  you,
Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Madam Speaker,  the  amendment  which  the  hon  Redcliffe
introduced was rejected because it was already  covered  in  the  Employment
Equity Act, and not because we didn't want it.

For many years blacks - and this is the amendment he wanted  -  specifically
wanted to have the word ``black'' defined. I'll define  it  for  you  today.
For many years blacks, meaning Africans, coloureds and Indians, as  well  as
women  and  disabled  people,  were  denied  access   to   suitable   skills
development by the apartheid regime. The industrial  and  corporate  sectors
were almost a no-go zone for skills  development  for  black  people.  Today
thousands of previously disadvantaged individuals  are  undergoing  training
to better their lives through almost all the Setas. Of course, a  lot  needs
to be done. Skilled people  will  also  benefit  more  from  black  economic
empowerment.

Let me quote David Berger,  in  the  leader  page  in  today's  Cape  Times,
writing under the heading: "How BEE could benefit everyone", and I quote:


  In post-1994 South Africa, black economic empowerment (BEE) is part of an
  integrated   strategy   to   eliminate   poverty   and   achieve   global
  competitiveness  through  sustainable  development.  The   goal   is   an
  opportunity  society  where  people  are  rewarded  according  to   their
  contributions.


  The strategy focuses on a world economic  system  based  on  fair  trade;
  eliminating  poverty;  macroeconomic  stability  and  competitiveness;  a
  social security system for the  young,  aged,  disabled  and  unemployed;
  Government intervention for rural development and  urban  reconstruction;
  human resource development; and BEE to mainstream the marginalised.


  The key to understanding Government's implementation  plan  is  knowledge
  intensification. Knowledge intensification is a  people-centred  approach
  to sustainable  development.  Government  departments  lead  the  way  by
  setting  goals,  strategic  planning  and  organisational  change  -  new
  business processes and skill development.

Unlike the load of rubbish that was written by hon Mark Lowe in  the  column
next to this particular page ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Sê vir hulle, Danny. Praat  met  hulle.  [Tell  them,  Danny.
Talk to them.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: I just want to tell him that the  DA  rejected  the  whole
question of black economic empowerment.

Mr M J ELLIS: No, that's rubbish.
Mr D A A OLIFANT: You did.  You  voted  against  it.  Why  do  you  say  its
rubbish? [Interjections.]  You  rejected  black  economic  empowerment.  You
voted against it. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, would you both address the Chair.  The  one
at the podium would start by continuing with his speech.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: I want to ask you to please go and tell Mrs or Ms  Nosipho
Mfengwana, whom you visited in Philippi after you rejected  the  Bill,  that
you don't want her to uplift herself. You should go  and  tell  her.  That's
the reason you rejected the Bill. You deny her the right to have her  skills
developed. You deny her the right to be economically uplifted.

An HON MEMBER: Sê vir hulle, Danny. [Tell them, Danny.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: We are proud to say that we  want  the  Minister  to  have
more powers  so  that  the  Minister  can  intervene  where  Setas  are  not
performing, to ensure that Mrs Nosipho Mfengwana is  economically  empowered
and has her skills developed, unlike  your  opportunistic  approach  to  the
whole question of development in this country.  Minister,  we  support  this
amending Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

UMPHATHISWA  WEZABASEBENZI:  Somlomo,  usindw'  ezama,  ndibhekisa  kwilungu
elihloniphekileyo uRedcliffe, akana tyala. Okungalunganga kukusonga  izandla
kusonakala. I-ANC, Mnu Redcliffe, ayisokuze ivume ithi daxa, dudlu  okwehagu
enyisayo, kusonakala. Kuyanyanzeleka, ukuba sifuna abantu bavuke  bazenzele,
ukuba sibaqeqeshe baphuhlise izakhono zabo.  Sifuna  abantu  abamnyama  beli
lizwe balubambe uqoqosho lweli lizwe.  Nawe  ngaphezulu,  nabantwana  bakho,
kuba ungumcinezelwa, nto nje ingxaki yakho awukacacelwa yiloo nto apha  kuwe
entloko.

Ndibamba ngazibini ke kuwo onke amalungu  ahloniphekileyo.  Camagwini  bantu
bahle.   Ndakunihlubela   iimpundu   ke,   mhla   ndatyeba.   [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)
[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Madam Speaker, with  reference  to  hon  Redcliffe,
there is no harm in trying. What is wrong is to sit with folded arms  whilst
things go wrong.

Hon Redcliffe, the ANC will never allow people to lie flat  on  the  ground,
like a sow feeding its piglets, whilst things go wrong.  It  is  imperative,
if we want people to arise and act, that we train them in order  to  develop
their skills. We want the black people of this country to  have  a  hold  on
the economy of this country. You, too, and your children.  Because  you  are
oppressed. It's just that your problem is  that  this  has  not  yet  become
clear in your mind.

I am very grateful to all the hon  members.  Thanks,  good  people.  I  will
share with you what I value most one day. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
