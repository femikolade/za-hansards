                               FLOOR CROSSING

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! I have to announce that, in terms of Schedule  6(a),  Mr
A Blaas has, on 3  April  2003,  left  the  New  NP  and  joined  the  ACDP.
[Applause.]

I also wish to clarify concerns that have  been  expressed  about  a  second
period to cross the floor in the new  future.  Now,  concerning  the  period
provided for in the amended Constitution,  notwithstanding  reports  to  the
contrary, the current window period closes at midnight tonight.

Further, I have obtained legal opinion that the second  window  period  that
occurs in the fourth year after the date of an election would, for the  term
of this Parliament, have occurred between 1 and 15 September 2002. There  is
no further window period until after  the  next  election.  [Applause.]  The
staff will be available up until midnight tonight  to  deal  with  any  more
floor crossings.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

                    HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA

Mrs J A SEMPLE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move  on
the next sitting day:


  That the House discusses the continued scourge of  human  trafficking  in
  the Southern African region, particularly the trafficking of women as sex
  slaves, with a view to identifying measures to prevent cross-border human
  trafficking.
         EVERT VAN NIEKERK ROAD SAFETY ACHIEVEMENT OF THE YEAR AWARD

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I hereby move without notice: That the House:


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Evert van Niekerk Road Safety Achievement of the Year Award,
           the premier accolade for the furtherance of road safety in South

           Journalists' Committee for Active Road Safety (Cars); and


       (c)  both these two  institutions  made  a  significant  contribution
           towards road safety by changing the mindset of road users; and
  (2) congratulates them and hopes that their  initiatives  will  encourage
       other role-players to follow suit.

Agreed to.

                              IMBIZO FOCUS WEEK

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W G MAKANDA (ANC): Madam Speaker,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of
South Africa has embarked on an Imbizo Focus Week as  from  31  March  to  6
April. Members of the Cabinet, including Deputy President  Jacob  Zuma,  are
participating in events across the country where they are  interacting  with
the peoples of South Africa.  The  theme  for  the  Imbizo  Focus  Week  is:
Imbizo: Build a Peoples' Contract for a Better South Africa.

The imbizo forums are effective in strengthening  dialogue  and  interaction
between Government and the people. The imbizo programmes  also  reflect  the
preparedness of the people's Government to listen to  the  concerns  of  the
people and build winning partnerships to build a better  life  for  all  our
people. We call on all our people to participate in  the  imbizo  programmes
and ensure that their voices are heard. It is  through  dynamic  interaction
between Government and the people that we can achieve our noble  goal  of  a
united, nonracial, nonsexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa.

                       CONSEQUENCES OF FLOOR CROSSING

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W J SEREMANE (DA): Madam Speaker, the legal provision allowing members
of Parliament to cross the floor to other parties has ensured that the two
largest political parties have grown larger, emphasising that the choice of
voters is between the ANC and the real alternative, the DA.
[Interjections.]

An unfortunate aspect of floor crossing has been the proliferation of small
parties. The NA now has four parties which did not receive a single vote in
the last elections. Some of these may have been inspired by the fact that
leaders of parties have received allowances from Parliament. However,
democracy has a way of dealing with such people. [Interjections.] An
election is scheduled next year and the voters will be able to have their
final say in the matter. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I wish to alert you that casting
aspersions on the motives of anyone crossing the floor is unparliamentary
and should be avoided.

            GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMME TO POOR RURAL PEOPLE

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Madam Speaker, in times  gone  by,  people  in  rural
areas were not sustained by governments. They knew  in  the  back  of  their
minds that governments do not create wealth. Wealth is  created  by  private
sectors working on  farmlands,  producing  mealies,  corn,  sweet  potatoes,
amadumbe, etc. This work was done as a collective by  neighbours  and  well-
wishers which, in today's frame of  mind,  are  called  co-operatives.  Such
indigenous people sustained themselves  by  tilling  the  soil  and  keeping
their stock.

What is today known as the frontiers of poverty was in fact unknown at  that
time. Soil tillage was the only source of livelihood  and  people's  houses,
though shaped like igloos, were neat, clean and hygienic.

Soil tillage was possible because there were farm implements such  as  spans
of oxen and donkeys, hoes and other farming tools. Because  of  the  absence
of the above, the frontiers of poverty keep on haunting us.  If  Government,
as we saw it during the Agriculture and Land  Affairs  Budget  Vote  debate,
can intensify its assistance with tractors, rakes, planters, etc,  to  rural
and traditional communities, hunger and poverty will be driven away.

          TRAFFICKING OF WOMEN BETWEEN MOZAMBIQUE AND SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss M N MAGAZI (ANC): Madam Speaker, while driving  in  Hillbrow,  Yeoville
and Mellvile, you will see young Mozambicans  sitting  on  the  street.  The
SABC's Special Assignment featured a programme on human trafficking  between
South Africa and Mozambique.

Young girls from the age of 12 and women are lured to come to  South  Africa
to work in restaurants. When they arrive in the country, they  are  sold  as
sex slaves. Some of these girls are employed  in  brothels  in  Hillbrow  as
prostitutes. Because of their situation they become vulnerable to drugs  and
to HIV infection and other forms of abuse. Their  dealers  take  away  their
travel documents and these women are unable to  report  cases  of  abuse  as
they would be arrested for being in the country illegally.  Some  have  come
to accept this role imposed on them as it provides  possibilities  for  food
and security and thus they can  escape  the  poverty  in  their  country  of
birth.

The sex slave trade undermines the dignity of  young  women.  This  barbaric
act is a reflection of male-dominated and exploitative social  relations  in
society. Such acts are a crime against humanity  and  are  contrary  to  the
spirit of the Bill of Rights that seeks to protect the  individual's  rights
to choices and freedom of movement.

We call on people to expose and isolate those elements that  make  a  profit
from this practice. We recommend strongly  that  the  Governments  of  South
Africa and Mozambique introduce measures or  mechanisms  that  ban  the  sex
slave trade so that those who are found to be practising it are  put  behind
bars. I thank you. [Applause.]

                            REVISION OF LAND ACTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP  welcomes  the  Minister  of
Housing's statement that the Prevention of Illegal  Eviction  from  Unlawful
Occupation of Land Act of 1998 is being amended.

Last year, the New NP submitted a request to the  Minister  of  Housing  and
the Portfolio Committee on Housing  to  urgently  revise  the  Extension  of
Security of Tenure Act of 1997 this was  because the ruling  of  the  appeal
court on the interpretation of the Extension of Security of  Tenure  Act  of
1997 as well as the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from Unlawful  Occupation
of Land Act gave the green light for the  protection  of  nonpaying  tenants
and property owners, which we believe was an unintended consequence  of  the
Act.

The New NP acknowledges human rights as  stated  in  the  Constitution  with
regard to housing, but it is just as important that we  protect  the  rights
of investors, financial institutions and estate and  letting  agents.  South
Africa cannot afford  uncertainty  in  the  housing  market.  Therefore  the
amending Bill should be submitted to Cabinet as a matter of urgency.

              GOVERNMENT'S FAILURE TO FIGHT HIV/AIDS AND HUNGER

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N C NKABINDE (UDM): Madam Speaker, the remarks made by  Deputy  President
Jacob Zuma that HIV/Aids treatment will be  dead  without  nutrition  is  an
insult to millions of suffering South Africans. If the Deputy President  and
the  Minister  of  Health  were  serious  about  hunger,  they  should  have
addressed the matter over the past nine years of ANC-rule.

For the past year, they have ignored  the  UDM's  food  parcel  proposal  to
fight starvation and malnutrition. Now  that  they  feel  the  pressure  for
neglecting the people living with HIV/Aids, they are shifting the  blame  to
hunger. Both the Deputy President and the Minister  of  Health  are  failing
dismally to announce a national  plan  of  action  to  combat  the  HIV/Aids
pandemic. HIV/Aids is reaching crisis proportions, and so  is  hunger.  With
their  latest  disingenuous  argument,  the  ANC-led  Government  is  merely
highlighting its failures on both fronts. [Interjections.]

                  RECYCLING AND ENVIRONMENTAL PRESERVATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr K MOONSAMY (ANC): Comrade Speaker, the Minister of Environmental  Affairs
and Tourism, Comrade Valli Moosa, visited a plastic  bag  recycling  factory
in Bronkhorstpruit on Tuesday, 1 April 2003.  This  visit  is  part  of  the
Government's Imbizo Focus Week which started  on  31  March  2003.  Minister
Moosa visited the  Transpeco  factory  to  get  a  first-hand  account  from
workers on how the recycling industry has  changed  workers'  lives  through
job creation.

He told workers that a section 21 company would be  established  to  promote
efficiency in the use, reuse, collection, recycling and disposal of  plastic
bags. The company will also manage and support Government in the removal  of
plastic bag litter from  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  The  government
programme to recycle  plastic  bags  is  part  of  a  programme  to  enhance
development which preserves our environment.

Furthermore the recycling of plastic bags creates sustainable jobs and  thus
empowers the community  through  environment  preservation.  This  programme
reflects the Government's commitment to building a better life for  all  our
people through managing waste. [Applause.]

                     IMPACT OF MINIMUM WAGE LEGISLATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P H K DITSHETELO (UCDP): Speaker, we have  noted  with  regret  that  the
poorest of the poor continue to be  subjected  to  inhumane  and  unfriendly
conditions of employment, especially in rural  areas.  The  recent  incident
that happened in Limpopo Province involved the farmworkers employed  by  one
of the leading tomato producing companies called  ZZ2  which  has  responded
negatively to the Government-initiated legislation of minimum wages.  It  is
further reported that ZZ2 deducted 55% of their gross income  towards  their
accommodation and food, which means that an employee who  earns  R650  takes
home R300.

This company,  together  with  other  companies  in  the  same  sector,  has
resorted to defying the Government by punishing and dismissing its  workers.
It is sad indeed that a democratic society like ours, with all the  relevant
progressive labour regimes in place,  has  a  situation  where  workers  are
still oppressed. This case is an indictment of the  Department  of  Labour's
inability to be proactive in monitoring the implementation of its  policies.
We cannot afford a situation where more than  2  000  jobs  are  being  lost
because the department  has  not  acted  on  time  to  inspect  the  working
conditions the farmworkers are exposed to.

We need some proactive action from the department in terms of assisting  the
dismissed workers to be reinstated.  We  should  avoid  locking  the  stable
after the horse has bolted.

               EFFORTS BY SA POLICE SERVICE TO ERADICATE CRIME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE (Azapo): Madam Speaker, over the past week we must  have
noticed the efforts of  the  SA  Police  Services  to  rid  the  suburbs  of
Hillbrow and Berea of crime. These two suburbs have become almost  liberated
zones for criminals of all types from all over the world, including  illegal
immigrants. These suburbs have become the prime destination  of  the  smooth
and rough criminals.

If not tackled right now, this little murky world of  crime  and  vice  will
gradually spread, and ultimately engulf all surrounding  neighbourhoods.  No
one wants to live under the  heels  of  murderers,  drug  lords,  smugglers,
hijackers and street corner bombers, not  to  mention  those  who  trade  in
human beings.

The men and women who are in this service certainly need our support.  Their
salaries and other benefits need to be adjusted,  because  they  risk  their
lives and give their all to make  life  in  society  normal.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

                            ELECTIONS IN NIGERIA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr K M MOEKETSE (ANC): Madam Speaker, there were  media  reports  that  more
than 100 people were missing, and some were  feared  dead,  after  they  had
jumped into a river in Nigeria. This happened because  of  the  pre-election
violence  that  is  taking  place.  Nigerians  are  scheduled   to   go   to
parliamentary elections on 12 April 2003 and the  presidential  election  is
on 29 May 2003.

The people  of  Nigeria,  and  their  popular  representatives,  are  making
strides in building stability and national unity in their own society.  They
have also shown their commitment to Africa by playing an important  role  in
the revival of the continent through the African Union and  Nepad.  As  they
approach both the parliamentary and presidential elections  they  must  work
for the success of these historic processes, as they are  doing  in  working
for the rebirth of the African continent.

The lesson that South  Africans  have  learnt  is  that  lasting  peace  and
stability are further strengthened if the government of the day is based  on
the will of the people. We call on all Nigerian people to  work  for  peace,
political tolerance and to uphold the right of individuals to belong to  and
vote for a party of their choice. This, in our view, is  also  important  if
we, the people of South Africa, Nigeria, and the African masses as a  whole,
are able to tackle the task of making this century an African century.

We, therefore, call on all the Nigerian people to work for peace and  ensure
that these elections will be an expression of the voice  of  the  people  of
Nigeria. Thank you. [Applause.]

                      SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S V  KALYAN  (DA):  Madam  Speaker,  the  recent  outbreak  of  atypical
pneumonia, or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),  has  infected  more
than 1 700 people in 15 countries and resulted in the deaths of at least  62
people in South East Asia. This killer virus,  which  is  rapidly  spreading
across the globe, has been declared a communicable disease  and  presents  a
great threat to HIV-positive persons, as they are more likely to succumb  to
SARS as a result of a lowered immune system.

It gives cause for concern to note that South  Africa  has  not  implemented
any screening procedures at international airports for those travellers  who
are disembarking from affected hubs. The Ministry of Health is urged to  set
up  screening  desks  immediately,  and  to  also   distribute   information
pamphlets  outlining  the  symptoms  of  SARS,  quarantine   and   treatment
procedures. Failure to implement a national  awareness  campaign  about  the
seriousness of SARS is sure to impact, not  only  on  the  health  of  South
Africans, but also on tourism and the economy.

                                 WAR IN IRAQ

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S K LOUW (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  the  war  in  Iraq  continues  to  cause
unimaginable pain, devastation and  destruction  of  all  aspects  of  Iraqi
lives. It has not  only  affected  military  infrastructure,  personnel  and
equipment, but it has also wreaked havoc on hospitals and  shopping  centres
and has resulted  in  overall  human  suffering,  with  women  and  children
bearing the brunt of the war.

A recent Unicef briefing on the situation in Iraq notes that there is now  a
threat of disease as tens of thousands of people in their  homes,  hospitals
and care institutions attempt to survive the war and find  what  water  they
can from the rivers and other sources. The report from  the  state  is  that
children  are  now  likely  to  die  from  diarrhoea  and  dehydration.  The
organisation continues to estimate that at least 100 000 children under  the
age of five are now at risk. These  painful  developments  should  serve  to
emphasise the need to exhaust all peaceful multilateral avenues  before  the
path of violence is contemplated.

                          RIGHT-WING ELEMENT IN DA

                            (Member's Statement)

The ANC expresses the hope that the war will end quickly to  minimise  human
suffering. [Applause.]

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Speaker,  die  regse  onderrok
van die DA hang daagliks al verder uit. Dit word bevestig deur die feit  dat
die DA vir Bernice Sono na die Nasionale Raad van  Provinsies  verskuif  het
en haar vervang het  met  die  oud-KP  Wikus  Theron  ten  einde  die  regse
groepering in die Nasionale Vergadering te versterk.

Woensdag het DA-lede in hierdie Huis hand geklap toe dit aangekondig is  dat
een van hulle kollegas, die agb  DA-lid  Richard  Pillay,  na  die  Nuwe  NP
oorloop. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is duidelik dat die DA bereid is om sy  regse
geledere te versterk en  terselfdertyd  dankbaar  is  wanneer  lede  wat  'n
bydrae wil lewer  tot  die  skep  van  'n  nie-rassige  Suid-Afrika  die  DA
verlaat. Dit bevestig die agb Pillay se standpunt dat die DA deur  'n  regse
elite beheer word en dat die DA-grondwet verseker dat  daardie  elite  altyd
in beheer sal wees.

Weet die oud-Progge in die DA wat die prys is wat betaal sal moet  word  vir
die  regse  Trojaanse  perd  wat  nou  ook  in  sy  geledere  ingekom   het?
Koerantberigte bevestig dat dit 'n plan is  om  van  Tony  Leon  ontslae  te
raak. Die Nuwe NP het goeie raad vir die agb Leon: Slaap  met  jou  een  oog
oop, want die ``men in suits'' is terug in jou party om wraak  te  neem.  Ek
dank u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's  statement
follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Madam Speaker,  the  right-wing  petticoat
of the DA is showing more and more every day. This is confirmed by the  fact
that the DA moved Bernice Sono to the  National  Council  of  Provinces  and
replaced her with the ex-CP Wikus Theron in order to strengthen  the  right-
wing grouping in the National Assembly.

On Wednesday DA members applauded in this House when it was  announced  that
one of their colleagues, the hon DA member Richard Pillay, had  walked  over
to the New NP. [Interjections.] It is clear  that  the  DA  is  prepared  to
strengthen  its  right-wing  ranks  and  is  simultaneously  grateful   when
members, who want to make a contribution to  the  creation  of  a  nonracial
South Africa, leave the DA. This confirms the hon  Pillay's  viewpoint  that
the  DA  is  being  controlled  by  a  right-wing  elite  and  that  the  DA
constitution ensures that this elite will always be in control.

Do the ex-Progs in the DA know the price they  will  have  to  pay  for  the
right-wing Trojan  horse  that  has  also  now  come  in  among  its  ranks?
Newspaper reports confirm that this is the plan to get  rid  of  Tony  Leon.
The New NP has good advice for the  hon  Leon:  Sleep  with  one  eye  open,
because the ``men in suits'' are back in  your  party  to  take  revenge.  I
thank you. [Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER:  Order!  Hon  members,  as  the  IFP  did  not  make  a  second
statement, the rules allow the UDM, if they  have  one,  to  make  a  second
statement.

                    LACK OF INFORMATION ON PROVIDENT FUND

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J T MASEKA (UDM): Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight  some  of  the
problems facing citizens of this country who belong to  the  working  class,
especially those working for Tiger Brands, previously known  as  the  Beacon
company, and the Portnet workers in Durban.

When their pension fund was transferred to a provident fund, some  were  not
advised on how much money was involved, and those  who  were  informed  have
not been given regular reports  as  to  how  and  where  their  moneys  were
invested. They are not being kept informed  about  the  development  of  the
fund itself, despite the fact that this  fund  belongs  to  them.  Sometimes
they do get information that the fund was invested in certain projects,  but
nobody knows what is happening to the dividends.

In some cases workers were told that they were  shareholders,  but  in  this
case the companies seemed reluctant or not prepared to  hold  meetings  with
the workers to brief  them  about  their  dividends.  For  example,  at  the
harbour container terminal section, workers were told  in  black  and  white
that their shares were worth approximately R1 299, but  a  year  later  they
were told their shares were worth only R500 because of the  depreciation  of
the rand. Today they have been told that their shares are not worth a cent.

The big question is: Where has the money  gone  to?  This  matter  has  been
reported to the labour unions and from the manner in which it  was  handled,
it  seems  the  unions  concerned  are  now  working  in  cahoots  with  the
management. I thank you.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 14 - Arts and  Culture  and  Vote  No  18  -  Science  and
Technology:

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Madam  Speaker  and
hon members of this House, I am very happy that we have  the  youth  present
here because arts, culture, science and technology are very much about  them
and their future.

I would like to congratulate Minister Brigitte Mabandla on  her  appointment
as Minister of Housing, and thank her for the contributions she has made  in
the domain of arts, culture, science and technology. It is a  pleasure  also
to congratulate the new  Deputy  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology, Ms Buyelwa Sonjica, on her appointment. [Applause.]

Science and technology are strengthening and  deepening  their  contribution
to our society and continent. Resource-poor  farmers  are  receiving  better
support  through  the  targeted  programmes  of  the  Agricultural  Research
Council. The poverty alleviation programmes of  the  Department  of  Science
and Technology have created  permanent  and  sustainable  jobs  through  the
transfer of the papermaking technologies and the development of  bee-keeping
and honey-making in rural communities.

The  CSIR,  working  with   the   automobile   manufacturing   sector,   has
strengthened this industry with skills  programmes,  research  outcomes  and
joint efforts that improve the quality and reduce the manufacturing cost  of
cars  produced  in  South  Africa.  The  Council  for  Geoscience  has  been
transferring  skills  and  capacities  for   geological   mapping   to   our
counterparts in Mozambique in  an  integrated  programme  supported  by  the
World Bank.

The Human Sciences Research Council has  produced  the  first  comprehensive
report detailing the disease profile of HIV/Aids and its  social  impact  on
our society. This careful piece of work was  given  signal  support  by  the
former President, Mr Nelson Mandela.

These are snapshots of the huge contributions made  by  our  scientists  and
researchers in bringing new knowledge and its benefits  to  our  society  in
practical ways. I could also talk about  the  massive  leadership  shown  by
Sasol in significantly increasing its  research  and  development  over  the
past number of years, and could point  to  an  increasing  number  of  small
firms that receive their  technology  and  development  through  the  Godisa
Incubator Programme and the Tshumisano Technology Stations Programme.

These developments take place in the context of the  National  Research  and
Development Strategy which was accepted by Cabinet last year and has led  to
a welcome increase, in real terms,  of  Government  science  and  technology
spending for the first time in a number of years. I  am  pleased  to  inform
you that it was decided at the Cabinet Lekgotla  that  we  will  produce  an
important complementary  strategy  on  technology  transfer.  Work  on  this
strategy has been initiated and we intend to produce this strategy  in  good
time to secure the necessary support and resources  for  its  implementation
in the next financial year.

I would like to turn to the issue of our legislative programme.  During  the
course of this year I hope to  present  to  Parliament  legislation  on  the
protection  and  effective  utilisation  of   indigenous   knowledge.   This
legislation  results  from  a  careful,  wide-ranging   policy   development
process, which has been  strongly  supported  since  its  inception  by  the
Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.

We are in the early stages of developing legislation that will harmonise
the governance of research councils and agencies, and government science
and technology institutions. The requirement for this legislation,
identified in the National R & D Strategy, results from the lack of a
single, coherent picture of Government spending on science and technology,
and also a need to ensure that institutions conform to a common set of
sound research and innovative management practices.

Legislation will be presented to Parliament  outlining  a  common,  enabling
framework for research and innovation  utilising  public  funds,  and  will,
among other matters, deal with the vexing question of intellectual  property
rights that arises from such national investments.

In the very short term, we hope to complete the process of the  adoption  of
the SA Council for Natural and Applied Scientific Professions Bill  by  this
Parliament. It has already been the subject  of  detailed  consideration  by
the portfolio committee. I am  very  pleased  to  report  to  you  that  the
increases in the Science Vote are to be applied to  a  number  of  important
strategic areas identified in the National R & D Strategies.

Notwithstanding the ongoing, positive outcomes from our National  System  of
Innovation, there are many challenges still to be  addressed.  There  is  an
urgent need for enhanced innovation that  will  lead  to  new  products  and
services being available to our people, and for  increased  economic  growth
mediated through our firms and industries.

The main focus of our spending this year will be  the  first  full  year  of
investment  in  the  Biotechnology  Regional  Innovation  Centres  and   the
National  Bioinformatics  Network.  The   Tshumisano   Technology   Stations
Programme  and  the  Godisa  Incubator  Programme  will   have   substantial
increases in resources to strengthen  their  ability  to  create  and  serve
small, medium and micro enterprises.

We have also dedicated resources to  the  improved  use  of  technology  and
innovation in poverty alleviation. This programme will grow  with  time  and
the focus in this first year is the  identification  of  new  and  effective
techniques of mobilising our resources in this important area.
The National Advisory Council on Innovation  has  advised  me  that  it  has
completed the process of developing the  Advanced  Manufacturing  Technology
Strategy that  I  requested  them  to  initiate  in  June  last  year.  This
important strategy will be taken to Cabinet soon. It  targets  a  number  of
areas related to the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy of the Department  of
Trade and Industry, where technology and innovation can make  a  substantial
difference to the quality and productivity of  our  industry.  In  addition,
work is being undertaken to develop  technology  and  innovation  strategies
for our resource-based industries.

In all these areas, a combination of reprioritisation and requests  for  new
and additional resources will be used to deliver real value and benefits  to
our people and underpin the positive development of our economy.

Science and technology has made a positive contribution in the development
of a vaccine for HIV/Aids. The South African Aids Vaccine Initiative, known
as Saavi, was recently reviewed by the Department of Science and Technology
and there is every indication that the first phases of the clinical trials
will be undertaken during 2003. I would like to applaud all the South
African and international institutions that have joined us in financing
this initiative.

Astronomy is good business for South Africa. I have reported in the past  on
the construction of the South African Large Telescope,  popularly  known  as
Salt. The South African Large Telescope continues to make good progress  and
we are anticipating that it will reach first light during 2004. I hope  that
it will represent part of the celebration  of  10  years  of  democracy  and
freedom in South Africa.

More recently, Cabinet gave its support to a  South  African  expression  of
interest to be the site for the next-generation radio  telescope,  known  as
the Square Kilometre Array, or SKA for short. This radio telescope  will  be
built at a cost of US$1 billion, and the nation that hosts this facility  is
expected to derive a direct  economic  benefit  worth  about  half  of  this
investment. It would be a major development, which  would  be  completed  by
2015 and would operate at least until 2050.

It is true that science and technology seems  sometimes  only  to  take  the
long view,  or  in  the  case  of  astronomy,  a  distant  view,  but  close
examination of our system shows that there are considerable  challenges,  in
the very short term, in increasing the number of scientists,  engineers  and
technologists in South Africa.  This  includes  school-level  interventions,
strengthening tertiary education and the  provision  of  meaningful  careers
for the young people  who  come  through  the  system.  Government  plays  a
critical role in  this  regard,  and  we  applaud  the  initiatives  of  the
Department of Labour and the Department of Education  in  strengthening  our
higher education and further education and training domains.

My  department  will  initiate  a  centres  of   excellence   programme   in
partnership with the National Research  Foundation,  which  is  intended  to
strengthen postgraduate production in key areas of relevance and  importance
to our nation. Centres of excellence concentrate on groups of academics  and
beneficiaries rather than on individual  projects.  This  has  the  positive
benefit of making a larger contribution over a shorter period of  time,  and
making the work more interesting and challenging for postgraduate students.

In addition to this, we will be strengthening our investment in key  science
areas of enduring value to South Africa, including astronomy,  as  indicated
above, palaeontology, the Antarctic and the Islands Research  Programmes  as
well as indigenous knowledge and key bioresources.

There  have  been  a  number  of  positive  developments  in   international
relations. I wish to single out our ongoing interaction  with  the  European
Union and the African,  Caribbean,  and  Pacific  countries  to  secure  new
financing for science and technology programmes within  the  ACP  countries.
We will report the full outcome of this process during  the  course  of  the
year, but the very practical and targeted nature of science  and  technology
and international relations is critical in these uncertain times.

Knowledge,  we  know,  defeats  poverty.  Scientists  are  involved  in  the
business of developing knowledge. We will continue to build and develop  our
National System of Innovation to serve the interests of all our  people.  We
invite our colleagues across Government  to  use  knowledge  and  innovation
more widely and more creatively to reduce the costs of  delivering  services
while at the same time improving the quality of the  services,  their  reach
and their impact. We should not only rely on  tried  and  tested  solutions,
but also continuously strive to acknowledge innovation  in  everything  that
we do.

We will continue to report to you the  positive  developments  arising  from
science and technology as much as we present  the  continuing  challenge  to
strategically increase our investment in this domain so that we  can  employ
the next generation of inventors and innovators who will bring new  benefits
and quality of life to our people.

I now turn to  the  arts  and  culture  portfolio.  A  few  weeks  ago,  the
Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science and Technology  invited  South
Africans to make submissions on the Department of Arts and  Culture  budget.
As a people-centred  Government,  it  was  a  positive  sign  to  note  with
appreciation our stakeholders' willingness  to  partner  the  department  to
ensure that resources are a strategic tool to create a better life for  all.
With  changing  demands  within  the  local  and  global  context,  the  new
Department of Arts and Culture was formed in August last  year.  I  am  very
happy to welcome to this, his first budget debate on arts and  culture,  our
new  Director-General  for  Arts  and  Culture,   Prof   Itumeleng   Mosala.
[Applause.]

As we approach the end of the first decade of democracy, we must find  means
to cement the bonds of our nation. I foresee that culture  will  be  at  the
centre of developments to celebrate our 10 years of democracy  and  what  it
has made possible in terms of reconstruction  and  development  and  nation-
building and reconciliation.

The 10th anniversary of our democracy will be next year. The  build-up  will
begin this year and celebrations will reach their peak in  April  2004  with
various local activities and  functions  at  most  South  African  embassies
abroad. We have dedicated significant fiscal resources to  celebrating  that
which is the major  turning  point  in  the  history  of  our  country.  For
projects or programmes on celebrating 10 years of democracy, the  Department
of Arts and Culture has been allocated an amount of  R80  million  which  is
spread over two financial years.

This is one of the significant increases  in  baseline  allocations  in  the
2003 budget, for which our total allocation is R926,527 million. Others  are
an amount of R60 million in 2003-04 and  R80  million  in  2004-05  for  the
infrastructure needs of our national  library  and  national  archives;  and
increased allocations to institutions and  the  Pan-South  African  Language
Board to the order of R31,5 million and R46,5 million, respectively.

Our institutions are the bedrock  of  arts  delivery  and  key  partners  in
unlocking creativity and implementing arts policy. In  the  next  three-year
financial cycle, the department is dedicating considerable amounts  to  this
sector. For the 2003-04 financial year, the allocation is R30  million,  and
for the 2004-05 financial year, the allocation is R45 million.  Finally,  in
the 2005-06 financial year, we forecast the budget for institutions  at  R60
million. Out  of  this  purse,  the  National  Heritage  Council  is  to  be
established within the current financial year. One of  its  objectives  will
be to disburse funding to heritage institutions.

Our playhouses and previously bloated art councils continue to transform.
We are committed to ensuring their maintenance and the stability of their
functioning. Our arts institutions assist in creating a sustainable
performing arts industry based on access, excellence, diversity and
redress. We have earmarked a total of R14 million for capital works to
playhouses this year. The total budget for performing arts institutions is
approximately R80 million. In addition to funding playhouses, the State
Theatre, Artscape, Pacofs and the Playhouse Company, there are increased
allocations to the Market and Windybrow Theatres.

Through ringfenced funding which is located at the NAC, the department has
been creating new arts companies which are effectively SMMEs and will be
funded over a three-year period. The advantages of that are manifold as
these smaller entities create stability within the arts and allow creative
freedom and the pursuit of excellence. This will go a long way to creating
role models and ensuring a cadre of industrious performing artists.

While debates on matters concerning our playhouses have been strong, so too
have concerns about the functioning of our orchestras. As a means to meet
the needs of a rapidly changing funding environment, the Department of Arts
and Culture developed a policy requiring partnerships between local,
provincial and national governments to support orchestras. In 2002, an
agreement was reached in KwaZulu-Natal that the municipal government, the
metro of Durban, the provincial government of KwaZulu-Natal and we, should
all contribute to supporting the KwaZulu-Natal Philharmonic Orchestra. We
have provided R3 million for that purpose.

This year, we extend the partnerships to the Western Cape and Gauteng with
agreements to ensure that a total of R9 million is allocated from the
Department of Arts and Culture alone. Orchestras will be developing
training programmes to ensure greater representation and participation by
young black South Africans.

The budget of the National Arts Council has dramatically increased over the
last two years to R42 million, which is committed to supporting performing
arts and dance companies at professional level and to developmental
community-based projects. These allocations from the Department of Arts and
Culture are used to optimise the value of international relations as well.

Through proposed and signed cultural agreements, most notably with the
Norwegian, Flemish and Swedish governments, we will be able to commit
significant resources to the development of music and other art forms. For
example, R25 million has been leveraged from the Flemish for five projects
which look into community art centres, arts education and training,
cultural management, craft and cultural policy. They will be funded for a
period of three years.

We are also  in  the  process  of  establishing  the  Swedish-South  African
institutional development fund with the Swedish government where  they  will
contribute R25 million  per  year  for  the  next  five  to  10  years.  The
Department of Arts and Culture will  match  those  funds  by  allocating  R5
million per year. The fund that will be launched in 2004 will also  look  at
disability issues.

Norway has made available a sum of R10 million per year until 2005  for  the
Mmino project which is located in the National  Arts  Council.  The  funding
for arts and culture has grown as more resources have become available.  The
Ministry has dedicated three officials to the National Lotteries Board,  and
through them we ensure that we provide access to support the full  range  of
the arts.

Since the turn of the millennium, we have seen a rapid growth of our  budget
in arts and culture at an annual rate of 18,3%  for  the  arts  and  culture
sector. I believe that this reflects well on the seriousness with  which  we
take our work and our accelerated rate of delivery. Growth is  projected  to
increase at an annual average of 20% over the medium term.

The  department  has  geared  up   for   efficient   delivery.   The   added
responsibilities, new  programmes  and  projects  have  necessitated  a  new
structure and organogram. Three new branches  have  been  formed.  They  are
arts,  culture  and  language   in   society;   cultural   development   and
international  relations;  and  heritage,  national  archives  and   library
services. Each of these will be headed by a deputy director-general.

In keeping with our commitment to building a strong institutional  capacity,
our most rapid growth areas are characterised  by  transfers  of  a  capital
nature. An amount of R764,035 million, 83%  of  the  2003  budget,  will  be
devoted  to  transfer  payments  to  support  arts,  culture  and   heritage
institutions. The Department of Arts and  Culture  are  responsible  for  27
public entities including museums, art galleries,  the  National  Zoological
Gardens, the national archives and the six playhouses mentioned above.

A strong and economically healthy nation places emphasis on the
construction and maintenance of its facilities. The department's capital
works budget has grown by more than 100% from R81,5 million in 2002-03 to
R168,5 million in 2003-04. Examples of how this money is spent are:
Investments that were made in institutions this year included R7 million
that was allocated to the Qunu component of the Nelson Mandela Museum; R6,3
million that was allocated to the Voortrekker Museum; R5,5 million was
allocated to the Northern Flagship institutions; R3,1 million was allocated
to the national museum; and R17 million was allocated to the Robben Island
Museum - R4,5 million of which went to the long-term project of repairing
the breakwater wall at Robben Island.

As we record and make our history accessible, it is also important to
create conditions that promote accessible, people-centred delivery and
information on Government and its resources for all our people. One of the
important efforts in which we will be engaged in in the coming years, in
order to achieve those objectives, is the popularisation of the National
Language Policy Framework which was launched in late March this year. This
important strategy will contribute significantly to service delivery from
Government and will increase access to the work of Government for all our
people.

The National Language Policy Framework promotes the equitable use of our
official languages and ensures redress for the previously marginalised
indigenous languages. While a national vision for our people and the use of
our languages has been forged, provincial governments should model their
policies for promoting multilingualism within the National Language Policy
Framework, and take into account regional circumstances and the needs and
preferences of local communities.

Building on my budget address last year, I am able to announce new projects
which have been developed to enhance communication and information flows,
particularly across the language barrier. The videophone facility for sign
language interpreting was launched in August as part of the Tissa project.
Another Tissa pilot project is currently operational at some 40 police
stations across the country.

There have been hiccups in these pilot projects, but I would like to  assure
the House that we are dealing with those and we will  not  allow  this  very
important initiative to falter. In  addition,  we  showcased  Tissa  at  the
World Summit on  Sustainable  Development  and  enabled  delegates  to  have
access, 24 hours a day and seven days a week, to  20  designated  SA  Police
Service sites for the duration of the summit.  The  telephonic  interpreting
service was available between English and the Arabic,  French,  German,  and
Italian languages as well as Swahili, in  addition  to  the  official  South
African languages.

The underlying theme of the WSSD was the eradication  of  poverty.  Research
has substantiated the belief that the poor can and do find opportunities  in
the craft sector and, therefore, cultural industries have made a  meaningful
contribution to  the  economically  marginalised  and  have  contributed  to
growth in the tourism and marketing sectors.

This year the Department of Arts and Culture will work with  the  Department
of Trade and Industry in order to ensure that the craft  export  council  is
established. A strategy for craft marketing and financing will be  submitted
to Cabinet to engage Government  on  this  issue.  The  DAC  is  also  busy,
together with Create Africa South Africa, on a joint project with the Mappp-
Seta and  the  Department  of  Labour.  That  project  will  address  skills
development in the creative industries, in particular the crafts.

Those initiatives complement our poverty alleviation programme which now
stands at R42 million. We are committed to ensuring that this allocation
makes a positive impact on the lives of the poor. For the new financial
year, the Department of Arts and Culture will focus on urban renewal and
has designed pilot projects to an amount of R10 million in Alexandra, Cape
Town, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria and Durban. These projects will economically
empower South African artists, sculptors, painters and crafters.
Additionally, they also complement the strategic work of the Moral
Regeneration Movement and its current focus on infusing the urban landscape
with the values of tolerance, compassion and commitment.

A  key  issue  that  we  need  to  continually  address  in  our   work   is
transformation, particularly so in our heritage sector  where  developing  a
rounded view of our history must not be underestimated. To this end we  have
allocated R6,5 million for the transformation of heritage  institutions  and
the establishment of an advisory panel. Approved projects at some of the  50
national heritage  institutions  will  address  issues  of  multilingualism,
HIV/Aids awareness, development of new, accessible and relevant  exhibitions
and the repatriation of South African artworks.

Given the importance of the heritage sector in reflecting our identity as  a
nation, an amount of R8,3 million is earmarked for transformation and  human
resource development specifically to create jobs and safeguard our  national
idiom. New councils will be representative of all our people. A macro  body,
the  new  National  Heritage  Council,  will  assist  the  Ministry  in  co-
ordinating the implementation of policy through the various players  in  the
heritage sector.

Since 1994 we have, through the Legacy  Project,  instituted  programmes  to
celebrate South Africa's heroes who have made it possible for us to live  in
a democratic society. Not  least  of  those  was  Chief  Albert  Luthuli,  a
freedom fighter and the first South African to win the Nobel prize. It is  a
multifaceted project, in partnership  with  the  provincial  departments  of
arts and culture, the local community, members of the  Luthuli  family,  the
church, the national Department of Public Works and  Amafa  aKwaZulu-Natali,
which will officially be launched in December in Stanger. For Freedom  Park,
an international architectural competition has been  accredited  to  a  body
established by Unesco.  Architects  will  be  working  within  a  conceptual
framework that includes  representations  from  the  precolonial,  colonial,
apartheid and postapartheid periods. Winners will be announced  on  24  July
this year.

President Mbeki has spoken of the second decade of freedom  and  the  memory
of heroes in the struggle for freedom and justice. People  of  such  calibre
are recognised in a multitude of ways. One of the most important is  through
the award of national orders, the first of which was on 6 December  2002  at
a high-profile ceremony at the Union Buildings in Pretoria.

May 25 is Africa Day and South Africa will be hosting  representatives  from
across the continent. Nepad and the formation  of  the  African  Union  have
broadened our horizons and stimulated Government to  new  ways  of  creating
multilateral and bilateral linkages. An example of that is the South Africa-
Mali-Timbuktu Manuscripts Project which is driven by the Department of  Arts
and  Culture  through  the  national  archives.  The  restoration   of   the
historical manuscripts of Timbuktu dates back  to  the  Middle  Ages.  These
documents deal with the jurisprudence, science,  trade,  economy  and  every
day life of the Niger  Delta  valley  with  its  intellectual  centre  being
Timbuktu. This will be formally launched, in the presence of  our  President
and the President of Mali, on Africa Day.

Transfers to heritage institutions in the heritage,  national  archives  and
national library services programmes; arts and culture; and institutions  in
the arts, culture and language in society  programme  will  always  dominate
the Arts and Culture Vote, and will make up 72% of it in 2003-04.  Transfers
to heritage institutions will be  R486  million  in  2003-04,  bolstered  by
large allocations for Freedom Park over the medium term, and are  more  than
twice the value of transfers to arts and culture institutions  which  amount
to R180 million for the year 2003-04.

I am sure that the recent handing over of the final report of the Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission signifies a new  era  in  our  national  identity,
especially as  we  enter  the  second  decade  of  democracy.  Our  national
archives  are  setting  up  secure  systems  for  the  archival  storage  of
electronic records and  documentation  from  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission, in accordance with their recommendations. The Mellon  Foundation
is partnering us and has approved an initial seed grant  of  US$50  000  for
storing electronic records and setting up a  database  and  website  at  the
archives.

In conclusion,  we  are  committed  to  harnessing  the  greatest  potential
benefits from our programmes and our local  and  international  projects  in
the  arts  and  related  sectors.  As  we  approach  the  second  decade  of
democracy, let us not only reap the rewards of the first 10 years  but  also
sow the seeds for a strong, vibrant and secure future.

I have had the honour to present the combined budget for these two  separate
departments. However, these two departments are very  much  similar  in  the
sense that we, as Government, do not have to interfere.  We  simply  provide
the enabling environment for creative people,  scientists,  researchers  and
artists to do their work to their utmost and to show excellence.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon Deputy  Minister  and  hon
members, as we assemble here this morning,  in  a  peaceful  environment  in
this  Chamber,  men,  women  and  children  in  Iraq  are  under  siege   of
bombardments 24 hours a day. Isn't it sad  to  witness  on  our  TV  screens
women and children, in particular, die or suffer pain through  no  fault  of
theirs - in a war that could  have  been  avoided  had  the  United  Nations
inspectors of weapons of mass  destruction  been  given  an  opportunity  to
complete their task?

An HON MEMBER: What about Zimbabwe?

Mrs M A A NJOBE: As South Africans, let us reiterate the words of  President
Thabo Mbeki when he addressed the nation on 14 February this year  and  said
that we prefer peace to war.

Having said that, I wish to congratulate the following people on their new
appointments. Firstly, I congratulate the hon Brigitte Mabandla on her
promotion and appointment as Minister of Housing. Our portfolio committee
wishes her success in her new deployment. Secondly, I congratulate the hon
Buyelwa Sonjica on her appointment as Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology. To her the portfolio committee expresses the hope
that we shall work together well. [Applause.]

Then congratulations go to Prof Itumeleng Mosala on his appointment  as  the
Director-General of the newly established Department of  Arts  and  Culture.
We hope for good and productive working relations with  your  department  as
we all face the challenges ahead. Although you've been on the job  for  only
four days, we notice that you have already delivered the Department of  Arts
and Culture's strategic plan document. Congratulations. [Applause.]

Members, you now know that the former single Department  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology has been split into two  separate  departments:  Arts
and Culture, and Science and Technology, but under one Minister. We see  the
separation  as  an  acknowledgement  by  the  ANC-led  Government  that  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology had reached a  level  of
maturity where it was necessary to  focus  in  more  detail  on  each  area.
Indeed, many of us had previously proclaimed in  our  various  interventions
in this Parliament that the mandate of the former department was rather  too
broad.

We want to  congratulate  Minister  Ben  Ngubane  for  having  succeeded  in
steering the department to the stage at which it is today and wish  him  and
his deputy success in the  added  responsibilities  of  providing  political
leadership to two different departments.

Madam Speaker, the ANC supports this  budget.  Briefings  to  the  portfolio
committee on the budget revealed that the  DAC  now  has  a  completely  new
organogram and new programmes as tools to implement policy. Apart  from  the
administration, the other three programmes  of  this  department  are  arts,
culture and language in  society;  cultural  development  and  international
relations;  and  heritage,  national  archives  and  the  national   library
services.

These four programmes form the basis for the portfolio committee's
oversight work in this new department. Arts and culture should be regarded
as the building blocks of reconciliation, nation-building and moral
regeneration. This is an imperative for South Africa, a country with
diverse cultural values and norms. Programmes and activities that address
the transformation and promotion of arts and culture should be directed at
the alleviation of poverty in our society, the creation of jobs, the
eradication of diseases such as HIV/Aids and TB - as the Minister has
already mentioned - and even fighting crime.

South Africa has produced a wide range of good artists recognised locally
and internationally. Many have been honoured for their contribution. This
national asset should be utilised to promote patriotism among all the
peoples of this country.

During the budget hearings which the hon Minister referred to, which the
committee conducted two-and-a-half weeks ago, participating stakeholders
generally observed that new funding has come into the arts and culture
sector and that the areas they had been concerned about actually had real
increases in this financial year. They said the increases in transfer
payments to cultural institutions such as theatres, museums, funding bodies
and orchestras are an indication that indeed there is new funding for arts
and culture.

The National Arts Council, which supports various disciplines of arts and
culture through equitable distribution of funds, boasts an increase of R7
million over the medium term, while the budget for the promotion of arts
and culture in South Africa increases by over R28 million in the same
period. It is, therefore, hoped that the National Arts Council will no
longer be faced with the drying up of funds six months before the end of a
financial year, as has been the case before. It is also hoped that the fund
will benefit some of the traditional performing groups still struggling to
improve their lot. For instance, we notice that on programmes like Ezodumo
on SABC, in my opinion, the groups are not yet on the same level of
performance. I feel that those that are still struggling should be assisted
so that they can also come up to the same level as the others.

Madam Speaker, the promotion of linguistic diversity in our country is
entrenched in the Constitution, which protects language rights and promotes
indigenous languages. Therefore, approval of the draft national language
policy framework by Cabinet last year poses a challenge, not only to the
Government departments, but also to this Parliament, which currently is
also grappling with formulating its own language policy. I am glad, Madam
Speaker, it's still you who is on duty.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The only commonality between the
Speaker and myself is that we are wearing red today. [Laughter.]

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Oh, I see. I thought it was still Madam Speaker. I am
sorry.

However, one wishes to acknowledge some improvement in the interpretation
of indigenous languages in the National Assembly and advise the colleagues
on my left to once again make use of their microphones as they used to do
in 1994. This was of course before they were discouraged by the
interpretation that was not so good at that time. So, let us pick up our
microphones when people are speaking in their indigenous languages and
listen to the speeches. [Interjections.] We do so when it comes to
Afrikaans. I think you should also do the same for the indigenous
languages. [Applause.]

Let me now address the heritage sector and museums. The existence of
monuments, museums and memorials is an indication of the growing
consciousness of a nation seeking to represent its history and depict its
struggles, victories and changes from the past to the present. These
representations may sometimes express conflicting views. The South African
experience is a typical example of where the past was marked by conflicts
and divisions, while the present aims to redress these by striking a
balance between the past and the present and using them as building blocks
for reconciliation and nation-building, and as agents of change.

Since 1994, nine Legacy Projects have been identified. Of these, six have
been delivered by the department. Identification of Legacy Projects
involves public participation. The Legacy Committee, guided by specific
principles, evaluates the proposals and develops them into commemorative
structures or sites. Legacy Projects managed by the South African Heritage
Resource Agency, or SAHRA for short, are varied and widely distributed
throughout the country and therefore communicate a stimulating message of a
rich cultural diversity. Their commemoration should therefore be seen as a
living heritage.

The largest Legacy Project, of course, is Freedom Park - the Minister has
already mentioned this - located in Pretoria. Last year, the hon Minister
of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology announced an allocation of R50
million to kick-start the project. This doubles in the current financial
year and continues to do so in the medium term. Its budget is also boosted
for next year by an allocation of R40 million for the 10th anniversary
celebrations of democracy in April 2004. Dr Wally Serote, who is Freedom
Park's executive chairperson, describes it as a grade one project, a
heritage resource with qualities so exceptional they are of special
national significance.

On 11 April - that is next Friday - a delegation of the portfolio committee
will visit Freedom Park to gather firsthand information, which we hope to
use to initiate a debate in this House as part of our contribution towards
the 10th anniversary celebrations, and also, of course, to inform ourselves
as members of Parliament about this important project.

There are noticeable increases in allocations to the various museums,
including the Iziko museums of Cape Town, which the new CEO, Prof H C J
Bredenkamp, hopes to turn into African museums of excellence that empower
and inspire all people to celebrate and respect our diverse heritage. Such,
hon Minister, is the inspiration which stakeholders have derived from the
restructuring of the department, accompanied by an obvious increase in
funding.

While acknowledging an increase in the allocation for cultural industries,
it is, however, hoped that the new department will in future expand this
sector, as it has the potential for creating jobs and thus pushing back the
frontiers of poverty. Noted also is the allocation in 2003-04 of R42
million for poverty relief and we hope that the allocations for the next
two financial years, which have not yet been decided on, will be finalised
soon.

Among its activities, as a contribution towards the African Renaissance and
Nepad, the portfolio committee hopes to visit Mali - funding, of course,
being available - to view progress made and learn from the conservation of
the Arabic manuscripts in Timbuktu, whose cultural importance inspired
President Mbeki when he paid a visit to Mali in 2001. Thank you. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr S E OPPERMAN: Deputy Chair, in spite of a few hiccups and shortcomings,
for instance the lack of interpreting services for the visitors to the
House, we would like to thank the Minister and his department for a job
well done. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The DA agrees with the sentiments of the new DG for Arts and Culture, Dr
Mosala, as outlined in the document, Strategic Plan for the Department of
Arts and Culture for the period 1 April 2003 - 31 March 2006, that it is
essential for Arts and Culture to play an important role to promote
economic empowerment; to assist with poverty alleviation; to promote nation-
building; to improve sound governance; and to assist with the fight against
crime and HIV/Aids. We can no longer nurture creativity and innovation in a
vacuum but must also use it as a tool to confront South Africa's three
priority challenges, namely, unemployment, crime and HIV/Aids.

Met omtrent 'n derde van ons potensieel ekonomies aktiewe landsburgers wat
werkloos is, 'n situasie waarna Cosatu verwys as 'n nasionale krisis, moet
elke departement 'n bydrae lewer as deel van 'n korttermyn strategie om die
probleem van werkloosheid te konfronteer. Die Regering alleen kan nooit die
probleem oplos nie. Sy verantwoordelikheid is om 'n gunstige klimaat te
skep met verantwoordelike en verantwoordbare wetgewing en om 'n
fasiliterende rol te speel. Daardeur word vertroue gebou en stabiliteit
verseker wat weer sal lei tot vaste investering, groter vertroue, groter
stabiliteit en groter investering. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph
follows.)

[With approximately one third of our potentially economically active
citizens who are unemployed, a situation to which Cosatu refers as a
national crisis, every department must make a contribution as part of a
short-term strategy with which to confront the problem of unemployment. The
government could never solve the problem on its own. Its responsibility is
to create a conducive climate with responsible and accountable legislation
and to play a facilitating role. In this way, confidence is built and
stability ensured, which will in turn lead to fixed investment, increased
confidence, increased stability and increased investment.]

The community arts centres identified since 1993 by the National Arts
Coalition and the Arts and Culture Task Group can play an important role as
institutions in realising the ideals as set out by the department.

I want to repeat what the hon Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture once
said, namely that a people which cherishes its art and culture is a people
with confidence, passion and dreams. I can apply the truth to a person
described by a journalist in 1998 as a ``razzle-dazzle showman, a prolific
playwright, a reform enthusiast and trainer of some of the country's finest
actors''. This person is none other than Bra Gib. Although he is HIV-
positive and broke, he is as flamboyant as ever, wearing the crown as
father of township theatre - truly, a man full of confidence, passion and
dreams.

Community arts centres can assist in creating people with inner strength,
people with confidence and dreams. Therefore the department must urgently
address problems if we want community arts centres to reach their full
potential. These problems are issues like funding, the capacity-building of
art centre managers, integration of community art centres into local IDPs,
assistance to municipalities who lack funding to support their own arts
centres, policy development and the establishment of national and
provincial steering committees. While some centres are positively impacting
their communities, others are no longer operating.

Ons verstaan die probleem van die Tesourie ten opsigte van befondsing, maar
indien ons nie genoeg fokus en doelgerig ons ideale probeer bereik nie, sal
elke poging eindig in frustrasie, verleentheid en teleurstelling. Die DA
glo elke mandaat moet deur behoorlike befondsing ondersteun word. Dit sou
ook waardeer word indien die Minister ons kan inlig ten opsigte van die
vordering van die Kommissie vir Bevordering en Beskerming van die Regte van
Kulturele, Godsdienstige en Taalgemeenskappe. Dit is uiters noodsaaklik,
veral in die lig van die huidige debat rondom godsdiens in skole.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We understand the problem of the Treasury in respect of financing, but if
we are not focused and do not attempt to achieve our ideas with dedication,
every attempt will end in frustration, embarrassment and disappointment.
The DA believes every mandate must be supported by proper funding. It will
also be appreciated if the Minister can inform us about the progress of the
Commission for Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural,
Religious and Linguistic Communities. This is essential, especially in the
light of the current debate on religion in schools.]

In conclusion, the DA foresees serious problems with the unrealistic
projection of the South African Geographical Names Council to deal with the
backlog of 57 000 names by March 2005. It implies, on average, dealing with
over 2 000 names per month. It will help if the hon Minister could advise
the Council that reviewing the names of geographic features, orthography of
names and research to establish original names takes time, needs wisdom and
a good dose of sensitivity. We cannot allow the exercise to end in more
Tzaneen/Mark Shope debacles. [Time expired.][Applause.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister
and colleagues. My focus in this debate is on the language policy in the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.

The department must be congratulated on producing a National Language
Policy Framework to implement the constitutional commitment to recognising
and bringing equity to all 11 languages of the country. It is also
gratifying to note that the Budget Vote under the National Language Service
in 1999 stood at R10,7 million and has been increased this year to R39,3
million. This is an indication of the commitment to handling and promoting
the complex issue of 11 official languages.

Some of the highlights of the language policy are that official languages
will be used in all legislative activities, including Hansard publications,
as a matter of right as required - provided that, in the case of provincial
legislatures, regional circumstances determine the languages to be used.

Thus, local governments will determine the language use and preferences of
their communities within an enabling provincial policy framework. All
government structures as well as institutions performing public functions
in terms of the legislation are bound by the language framework.

Various measures to promote the facilitation of multilingual communication
are indicated in the policy framework. One of these is engaging language
experts to assist with the process of developing functional multilingual
programmes.

With the development of the National Language Policy Framework, far-
reaching advances would be realised in Southern Africa, especially in the
SADC region. Thus there would be easy communication with people who speak
the Sotho cluster of languages - this would cover the people of Lesotho,
Botswana and the Barotse of Zambia. The Nguni cluster spreads over
Swaziland, the Ndebele of Zimbabwe and the Ngoni of Malawi. This
facilitation of mutual understanding will not only be enjoyed within the
plural society of South Africa, but will embrace a large part of Southern
Africa.

The National Language Policy Framework dovetails with the language policy
in the Department of Education which stresses multilingualism as an
extension of cultural diversity, which is an integral part of building a
nonracial South Africa. The underlying principle is to retain the learner's
home language for learning and teaching and to encourage learners to
acquire additional languages as well. This strengthens their efforts both
in school and in public life.

Within this programme there is flexibility. For instance, in cases where
government documents will not be available in all 11 languages, national
government departments must publish documents simultaneously in at least
six languages. This is at least one from the Nguni group, one from the
Sotho group, Tshivenda, Xitsonga, English and Afrikaans.

Knowing other people's languages is in itself empowering. Most people in
Gauteng, for instance, speak four languages with ease, that is, one of the
Sesotho languages, English, Afrikaans and isiZulu. Recently, I went to a
meeting in Gauteng and suddenly the people I was with began speaking one of
the Sotho languages and I protested and said: ``Speak English so that I can
understand what you are saying.'' Then they said: Why speak English? We are
going to speak Zulu so that you understand better.'' I felt that they were
highly empowered in being able to move freely from language to language and
there I was, unable to move beyond my mother tongue.

Language is not only an understanding of words, sentences and communication
but it carries culture and an understanding of very deep notions and
nuances of behaviour in society. Most of us, since we travel by air, see a
journal by the SAA called Sawubona. At first glance, it merely means a
greeting: We see you. But if you begin to know the language and really
think about what it says, you realise that it says: We are happy to see
you. And then you begin to ask: Why the plural? Why ``we''? Then you
realise that in the African cultures, very often people define themselves
in the plural. [Time expired.]

Mrs T J TSHIVHASE: Thank you, Chairperson. My speech will be focusing on
Programme 2 of Vote No 14, which focuses on art, culture and language in a
society.

[Chairperson, the ANC supports this budget. During the state of the nation
address, the President of the country indicated that the fight of the
Government is to push back the frontiers of poverty. This fight is for
everyone, especially all the departments. The Department of Arts, Culture,
Science and Technology must make a point of ensuring that the arts are the
top priority in pushing back the frontiers of poverty amongst our people.
That will only be visible if languages, which were oppressed since the
apartheid era, and more especially the black South African languages, are
developed.]

The first democratic Government in 1994 identified arts and culture as a
building block of reconciliation and nation-building, since South Africa is
a diverse country with different cultural values and norms. More progress
needs to take place regarding the transformation of the language system in
our country, especially in public institutions and sectors, for example, in
courts, on aeroplanes, in universities and Parliament.

[Language is a heritage, inherited from our forefathers. Parliament has the
challenge of solving the black South African language problems created
during the apartheid era.]

In other words, one can be identified by the language. With regard to the
language policy for Parliament, I have just highlighted a few things. The
key elements of the language policy are as follows: The element will spell
out the intention of the policy and the scope of applicability.

[Language must be scientifically planned before being developed in order to
suit the technological changes. The Constitution is focusing on
interpretation, respect for language rights, and the participation of the
community. Government must see to it that all languages are equal and all
authors must make sure that their books are published in their own
languages.

All these measures should be visible to make sure that all languages are
used in meetings, both in the national Parliament and in the legislatures.
Records must be kept in all the different languages in Parliament.

As far as interpreting services are concerned in Parliament, all relevant
facilities must be there to make it easier for all interpreters.
Interpreting must not only be provided in English. All languages must be
developed and speakers must be provided with information in time, in order
to express their feelings in the language of their choice. As far as
democracy is concerned, languages must not be discriminated against.
Researchers must give speakers information in time. It should be taken into
consideration that this procedure is supposed to be expensive and we need
to budget for it in order to avoid shortages.

Interpreters must be trained all the time so that they can do their work
properly. The NLS and PanSALB must develop the long oppressed languages.
There is an increase in the budget for these two structures. We expect
interpreting facilities to be available in order to solve these problems.]
The measurable objectives of this programme are to promote access to
resources mainly for arts and culture, improve artistic excellence and to
promote the language rights of the 11 languages through relevant policies,
development, legislation, equitable funding and service delivery. The aim
of the programme is to encourage and protect the arts and culture of the
country, especially when looking at the capability when coming to the
policy for gender and moral regeneration and linguistic diversity, in order
to allow all South Africans to participate fully in social, political and
economic life.

The duty of the performing arts structure is to look at sculpting, music,
film and dance, with the focus on developing arts and the economy. Certain
people still control the music and film industries, and this affects them
economically.]

Language stimulates moral regeneration and linguistic diversity in order to
allow South Africans to participate fully in social, political and economic
life. Crafters, musicians, film-makers and dancers must be developed.
Resources must be made available to enhance the above-mentioned skills.
Access to arts and culture must be maintained to improve artistic
excellence, and to protect the language rights of the eleven official
languages through relevant policy, development, legislation, equitable
funding and service delivery.

[The learning of traditional dances like tshikona, domba, mutshongolo and
kivha is fading away. Money is therefore needed to develop them. Plays must
also be developed, as it is well-known that ``local is lekker''. Religious
songs, kwaito and choirs must be developed as well. There should be
competitions up to overseas level, and we would benefit from that
economically.

The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology must work together
with the Department of Communications to develop all the art forms on
television. It could be plays, dances, etc. Blind people in South Africa
have no access to what happens on television. Last year during the ANC's
51st celebration in Stellenbosch, we noticed that what people do, say or
develop within their communities must be seen on television. This means
that the programme that is supposed to run within the community, must show
all these things. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Mr Chairman, today is a historic occasion. It is the
first time a separate budget debate is held on Science and Technology, and
it marks another milestone on the way toward achieving the objectives set
out in the White Paper.
Only last year did I gain some insight into the process that led to the
development of the science and technology policies and strategies
subsequently adopted by the present Government. I noted with interest that
Keith Gottschalk, on behalf of the ANC Western Cape's science and
technology group, proposed in his critique of the groundbreaking Proposals
for a future national science and technology management system by De Wet
and Kaplan that the portfolio of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology
would be best divided into two departments. It has happened.

I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the many scientists
and researchers on whose shoulders we stand today. Without their vision and
selfless devotion, South Africa would not be the leader in science and
technology on the continent today. It is obvious that a fresh wind is
blowing through science and technology and we certainly hope that the
division of the departments will benefit Arts and Culture to the same
extent.

Die skepping en die inhoud van 'n nasie se toekomsvisie, om net enkele
aspekte aan te roer, is 'n onontbeerlike element van nasionale sukses. Dit
gee 'n raamwerk waarbinne aksies gerig kan word op die nasionale doelwitte.
Die suksesvolle Oosterse lande het sulke nasionale visies geskep, waarvan
Japan en Singapoer goeie voorbeelde is. Die vermoë van die Stille Oseaan-
lande om hul bevolkings rondom 'n gedeelde doelwit te mobiliseer en om die
pogings van regering met die privaatsektor te integreer en met mekaar in
ooreenstemming te bring, is ongeëwenaard.

In ons land is daar nog baie werk wat gedoen moet word om die
struikelblokke uit die weg van so 'n konsensus te ruim. Op die terrein van
wetenskap en tegnologie in alle sfere staan die vervreemding van skaars en
ouer wordende kundigheid kritiek tot die inval agter so 'n nasionale visie.
Die dilemma wat die departement het, is dat sekere nasionale
beleidsrigtings en 'n hele skaar wette met betrekking tot menslike
hulpbronne nadelig inwerk op die bereiking van sy doelwitte. Miskien is dit
tyd dat die Regering opdrag gee aan die Raad vir Geesteswetenskaplike
Navorsing om 'n meer doeltreffende model van regstellende aksie te ontwerp.
Dan sal die Minister se pogings om die breinkwyn omgedraai te kry dalk
gouer sukses toon. Terloops, dit is ook een van die doelwitte van Nepad.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The creation and the content of a nation's vision for the future, just to
touch on a single aspect, comprise an essential element of national
success. It provides a framework within which actions can be directed at
national aims. The successful Eastern countries, of which Singapore and
Japan are good examples, created such national visions. The ability of the
Pacific Ocean countries to mobilise their populations around a common goal
and to integrate the efforts of government with the private sector and to
bring them in line with each other, is unequalled.

In our country much work still has to be done to clear the stumbling blocks
out of the way to such a consensus. In the area of science and technology
in all spheres the alienation of scarce and aging expertise is critical to
the support of such a national vision. The dilemma which the department
faces is that certain national policy directions and a whole range of
legislation with regard to human resources negatively affect the
achievement of its goals. Maybe the time has come for the Government to
instruct the Human Sciences Research Council to design a more efficient
model of affirmative action. Then the Minister's efforts to turn the brain
drain around may perhaps achieve success sooner. By the way, that is also
one of the goals of Nepad.]

A good place to start would be to look at the service delivery end of the
paradigm. It is no use supplying racial quotas at the top end of the scale
when that compromises the ability of the Government to improve the quality
of life of the poor. A model should be devised that places their interests
at the centre of the focus, instead of the present colour coding.

It is also encouraging that the South African Reference Group on Women in
Science and Technology, SARG, has been established which will be a
permanent subcommittee of the National Advisory Council on Innovation,
NACI. Gender mainstreaming will be the ultimate strategy which, inter alia,
will assist NACI in promoting a research agenda, including influencing
funding that will improve the quality of life of women, as well as
promoting innovation that will allow women to make a greater contribution
to wealth generation in South Africa - presumably with themselves as the
primary beneficiaries so as to counteract the feminisation of extreme
poverty. The New NP wishes them well in this and their other tasks.

The presentations on the budget by some of the science councils were
informative and enlightening and I should like to recommend particularly
that the comments and concerns raised by, among others, the Council for
Geoscience be taken into account by the department. We support that budget,
as well as the other one.

Die Nuwe NP wil graag Dr Itumeleng Mosala gelukwens met sy aanstelling.
Daar is hoë verwagtinge en ons sien uit daarna om hom beter te leer ken.
[The NNP would like to congratulate Dr Itumeleng Mosala on his appointment.
Expectations are high and we are looking forward to getting better
acquainted.]

The Corporate Strategy for Science and Technology just released illustrates
an integrationist approach focused around a coherent vision. It is clear
that the authors know their field and know where they want to take the
country. This should serve as in-house inspiration to sit down with the
right people and have a thorough rethink on culture and heritage.
Op die oomblik skiet ons nog met 'n haelgeweer en mis feitlik elke teiken.
[At the moment we are still shooting with a shotgun and missing almost
every target.]

If it means that the White Paper, the policy and legislation have to be
amended somewhat, that is what needs to be done.

Much good work has been done for which credit is due, but I think we need
to think even bigger. There is a need for an overarching Government arts
and culture system which should provide the framework for governance and
the support for the state's heritage and cultural entities. This department
must play a key role in the integration of culture-related and heritage-
related activities and functions of the various government departments. For
example, it is critically important that planning and development
legislation for local government is brought into line with conservation
objectives. To destroy older parts of cities, instead of sustainably using
them as many countries have been doing for centuries, can simply no longer
be allowed. Elsewhere, new buildings are erected outside the historic
precincts and that needs to be enforced in legislation here as well.
At the moment, fragmented governance structures make it impossible to gain
either a complete overview of the heritage and cultural assets of the
nation, or the potential for improving quality of life and the real
economic growth so brilliantly achieved in France, Germany, the USA and
elsewhere. The role of different government departments in governance and
setting output targets for Government's cultural and heritage usage is
neither clear nor synergistic. No value can be put on the national
patrimony and, from a budget perspective, there is no holistic view of
spending in this field by government departments.

So is die Departement vir Openbare Werke verantwoordelik vir duisende
staatseiendomme, waarvan ten minste 3 000 historiese geboue is. [In this
way the Department of Public Works is responsible for thousands of state-
owned properties, of which at least 3 000 are historical buildings.]

In the absence of coherent policy and governance, this department intends
to abolish the excellent Heritage Assets Management Unit, if it has not
done so already. I call on our Minister to take this up as a matter of
urgency and save what can be saved. A further good case in point is the
unique and wonderful Castle of Good Hope, which should be a draw-card
comparable to the Tower of London. The Castle falls under the Minister of
Defence. There are umpteen collections of art, furniture and objects of
great value in various departments and parastatals scattered all over the
country and abroad. Do we know what we possess?

Daar is oor die 400 museums in staatsbesit en die getal groei steeds.
Terloops, die Witskrif vir Wetenskap en Tegnologie dui aan dat museums daar
tuishoort, en ek stem daarmee saam. Elk van die museums is die tuiste van
waardevolle versamelings. Waar is die nasionale oudit? Transnet het
wonderlike ou treine en enjins, daar is veteraanvliegtuie; daar is
ongelooflike ou masjinerie in pakhuise en werkswinkels. Daar is duisende
rotstekeninge, talle en talle argeologiese terreine waarvan maar 'n
handjievol tot dusver ondersoek is. Dan is daar van die mooiste koloniale
barokgeboue in die hele wêreld, strandveldse huise, matjieshuise,
korbeelhuise, Ndebelewonings en al die sielvolle vissershuisies. Hierdie
geboueskat is besig om te verkrummel. Die ontwikkelaars sloop voor die voet
en ons wetgewing om erfenisbestuur toe te pas, bly agterweë. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[There are over 400 museums owned by the state and the number is still
increasing. By the way, the White Paper on Science and Technology shows
that museums belong there, and I do agree with that. Each of the museums is
the home of valuable collections. Where is the national audit? Transnet has
wonderful old trains and locomotives, there are vintage aeroplanes and
unbelievable machinery in warehouses and workshops. There are thousands of
rock paintings, and numerous archeological areas, of which only a handful
have thus far been investigated. Then there are among the most beautiful
colonial baroque buildings in the whole world, strandveld houses, mat
houses, corbelled houses, Ndebele dwellings and all those soulful little
fisherman's houses. This treasure trove of buildings is crumbling. The
developers demolish at random and our legislation is lagging behind when it
comes to the applying heritage management.]

The enormous economic potential of heritage conservation as a wealth-
generating industry needs to be quantified and put at the centre of arts
and culture policy. An important step to be taken is for indigenous
buildings to be grouped with strategic industries in the Department of
Trade and Industry. It is accepted that indigenous building is a craft
based on indigenous knowledge and it is unconscionable that, in a country
where there is such a wealth of vernacular building styles and
architecture, any kind of mass housing should be undertaken without
reference to such a valuable resource. The skills are there and the economy
inherent in organic and environmentally friendly building speaks for
itself.

I would also like to call most specifically on the Minister of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism to start interesting himself proactively
in arts and culture, and particularly in heritage. He has been
conspicuously silent on conserving and developing built heritage as a
tourism product.

In a new vision and a new policy, library services would take its rightful
place as irreplaceable in a knowledge-based economy. Time is running out to
solve the impasse of unfunded mandates for the provision of library
services by provincial governments.

Ten laaste wil ek toevoeg dat uitvoerende kunstenaars ook nie hul regmatige
plek in die staatsekonomie geniet nie. So lank as musici, toneelspelers en
kunstenaars dikwels armlastig moet sterf terwyl die kunste vervlak en
verkommersialiseer word om te kan voortbestaan, sal ons nie kan sê ons het
'n geslaagde kunstebeleid en 'n suksesvolle departement nie. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Finally, I want to add that the performing artists do not enjoy their
rightful place in the state economy either. As long as musicians, actors
and artists often have to die as paupers while the arts are demeaned and
commercialised in order to survive, we cannot say that we have a successful
arts policy or a successful department.]

There are many more aspects of culture that need to be dealt with in such a
thorough rethink and repositioning and I look forward to fruitful
interaction with our new director-general. The New NP supports this much
improved and very welcome budget.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! We have with us in the gallery
today a number of distinguished South Africans. They are Dr Ntwana
Tanzemane, John Shempe-Shapa, Tina Eboka, Prof Mike Broughton, Phil
Mujuwana, Nock Frick, Mandi Mzimba, Brian Figaji, Mark Orkin, Cheryl de la
Rey, Aziza Fredericks, Marc Lottering and Ahmed Kathrada. Welcome to all of
you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson,
Minister Ngubane, hon members, ladies and gentlemen and distinguished
guests, I think there are a number of thank-yous that I have to say before
I can get to my speech.

I think it is proper for me to pay tribute to as well as to congratulate
and wish hon Minister Mabandla well. She did sterling work while she was
Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, especially in
championing the issues relating to women. [Applause.]

I also want to thank the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology,
Minister Ngubane - it is a very long sentence, the name of this portfolio -
for a very warm welcome and the good support that he has given me thus far.
I am looking forward to a good working relationship between us. [Applause.]
I also want to thank Dr Rob Adams who was acting Director-General of Arts
and Culture as well as Director-General for Science and Technology. I want
to thank him for his advice and guidance. He has always been there for me.
Thank you very much, Rob.

Most importantly, I want to thank my staff who made it possible for me to
have this document which I will be reading from very confidently. It is
through the toiling of those people in my office that I have a speech.
Thank you very much to them.

Hon members, ladies and gentlemen, in about 11 months from now, on 27 April
2004, as a country, we will be celebrating 10 years of democracy. A week
ago my comrades testified at this podium that indeed the conditions have
improved for the majority of South Africans since 1994 and, to a certain
extent, I think Anna, when she was here, did bear testimony to that.

They also acknowledged the challenges that are still outstanding in our
programme of transformation and poverty eradication. It is for this reason,
among others, that the ANC declared this year ``the year of united action
to push back the frontiers of poverty.''

The 2003 Budget tabled by the Minister of Finance reflects this call and
makes an attempt to respond comprehensively to the needs of the people on
the ground. Likewise the budget of Arts and Culture has been designed to
achieve the broader aims of Government to accelerate spending on social
services and infrastructure investment for poverty alleviation through job
creation, among other things.

Minister Ngubane has already indicated the significant fiscal investment we
have made in hundreds of viable poverty alleviation projects around the
country. The list includes the R2 348 028 support given to craft and
cultural development projects in the St Lucia wetlands and the training of
about 692 people, most of whom are women.

The department funded numerous strategic craft and culture development
projects with spin-off benefits resulting in employment opportunities. So,
anybody who says we are not making an attempt at or a contribution towards
the reduction of the high unemployment rate, is making a mistake.
The CSIR's crafts project in the Eastern Cape has thus far created 275
jobs. In cases where jobs are not created directly, training is given in
such a way that self-employment opportunities are opened up, swelling the
capacity of the small and medium enterprise sector. For instance, the St
Lucia project has already ensured the training of the 692 people, as
already alluded to.

The restructuring process of the department to separate arts and culture
from science and technology by the end of 2002 was a result of the
realisation by the department that these are two very complex areas that
need special attention. What is importantly is the recognition that
developing our diverse culture and heritage is one way to sustainable
development.

We are determined to work hard and ensure accelerated service delivery and
the implementation of our projects. The department welcomes the growth
pattern of the arts and culture budget at an increase of 18,3%. The
Minister has already mentioned that that has been so for the past three
years. There is a projected annual growth of 20% over the medium term.

We hope that the restructuring which has taken place within the department
will result in further broadening access to arts and culture resources in
the country.

Out of the four programmes of the department, the Heritage National Archive
and the National Library Services programmes dominate in respect of the
increase in the arts and culture budget. Central to this increase is the
Freedom Park programme, which is the centrepiece of our Legacy Project. As
we approach the tenth anniversary of democracy, it is necessary to create
awareness and educate the nation about the heritage associated with the
liberation movements that have contributed to our goal of democracy.

It must be noted that there are a number of significant heritage
collections emanating from the struggle for liberation that have not been
made available to the general public of South Africa. These collections
remain invaluable in telling the story of the liberation of South Africa,
and they are an important testimony to the international solidarity and
friendship which was forged during the struggle.

We are keen to ensure that this heritage which we share with the
international community is given space within the heritage landscape of
South Africa.

It gave me great pleasure to note that Minister Mabandla participated in
the opening of the women's centre at the women's jail on the Constitution
Hill, Old Fort precincts. I think some of our comrades know what that jail
is like and what it used to be like.

The historic value of this area and what it symbolises for the struggle for
freedom and dignity in our country is immeasurable. Making the women's jail
part of our national heritage is one of the initiatives that symbolises the
fall of apartheid.

As we reflect on the transformation of the heritage landscape through the
implementation of Government's legacy projects, among them the Robben
Island Museum, Nelson Mandela Museum, Ncome-Blood River and the
commemorations of the Anglo-Boer War, we are proud to say that we have made
some significant strides in the area of arts and culture. This I want to
attribute to the Ministry led by the hon Dr Ngubane, but more specifically,
to my predecessor, Comrade Brigitte Mabandla.

As per the White Paper, we have so far managed to develop arts and culture
as a learning area, opening up opportunities and creating access to
economic development for the majority of South Africans.

Integrating arts and culture in our education curriculum is a fundamental
part of sustainable development. This is a major breakthrough and indeed
the tide is slowly turning in the direction we have been steering in for
the past 91 years.

The department has promoted conferences on women in writing and we will
continue to nurture this initiative. Allow me to emphasize that the
department is committed to public-private partnership and to cluster co-
operation with other departments. This is in line with Government's
integrated development approach for co-ordinated and sustainable service
delivery.

It is within this context that I am proud to say that the department's
craft programmes continue to have both a national and international impact
and, fortunately, I happened to visit one of these projects when I was
invited to launch it. When I looked at the product, I saw that indeed it
was of international standards. I was very proud to be associated with such
a product. [Applause.]

This was demonstrated by the Proudly South African accredited Beautiful
Things Crafts Exhibition at the WSSD. The success of this project has
prompted the setting up of a semipermanent exhibition in Newtown,
Johannesburg. The exhibition coincided with the DAC's annual craft imbizo.

Total sales at the WSSD in 2002 were worth about R2 million. Trade and
Investment South Africa, TISA, brought in approximately eight importers
using the inward-buying mission to the imbizo in 2002 to source new craft
products for their markets.

The direct and spin-off benefits of this are self-evident. We hope that the
recently announced Black Economic Empowerment Strategy and the envisaged
legislation will further strengthen opportunities for the SMME sector which
dominates the area of arts and culture. The department will make an effort
to use the Black Economic Empowerment Strategy to broaden participation and
economic activity within the sector. Together with provincial governments -
I hope the MECs are here because if they are, and we did not even mention
their presence here, then I now want to acknowledge them - we will ensure
that cultural diversity, particularly that which is indigenous to the
provinces, is promoted equally in an equitable manner.

The department hopes to encourage the National Film and Video Foundation to
work with provinces and host awareness and educational seminars in
different provinces so that films are reflective of our cultural diversity.

Further, the barriers that limit participation of women within the film
industry need to be addressed. The initiative by the Women of the Sun needs
to be enhanced and supported. We also wish to encourage ...
[Interjections.] I am sure I will have my speaking time because of my
coughing. We also wish to encourage partnership between the Government and
the private sector to the support of the film industry.

The department has worked with provincial governments in developing film
industries and we have, among other things, funded conferences and
workshops such as the African Film and Broadcasting Conference that is held
at Sithengi during November; one was held in November 2000.

Cultural industries such as film, publishing, music, design and crafts are
an important focal area for the department. We have set aside about R180
million for skills training for these and other creative industries over
the medium term. This is in line with Government policy that investment in
skills is necessary for sustainable poverty eradication and development.

According to the annual report of the department, the industry generated up
to R4 billion in 2001 in Cape Town alone. [Interjections.] So this
misconception that arts and culture is about entertainment and decorating,
I think, should be done away with. Arts and culture generates jobs and
creates wealth for a lot of people.

We acknowledge the inadequacy of R35 million allocated towards the film
fund, but this is only a start and we hope to review it as we go along.
This industry, if supported, may grow into a multibillion rand industry, as
seen in countries such as Canada, Japan, India and others.
Members of the House will remember the extensive programme of building
architecturally and functionally relevant community art centres around the
country in 1997. This complemented other rural development and urban
renewal strategies. We are using these resources as hubs of learning and
information-sharing for training and skills development in the film
industry and other sectors. This year we hope to secure the opportunities
for training and assistance for international partners through existing
bilateral cultural agreements. We are also in discussions to set up an
animation centre which is to be funded by an international partner.

We also continue to emphasize the importance of public-private
partnerships. Through one of our collaborations, we are co-ordinating an
empowerment programme for young film-makers.

The music industry is another strategic area especially for local economic
development. The Ministry has made strides in an effort to support the
music activities of the historically disadvantaged communities for whom
music has been the backbone of our culture. We need to encourage the
private sector to invest more in the local music industry, especially when
it comes to breaking the monopoly of the recording companies.

As a country, we have a responsibility to preserve and protect our national
heritage. Our archives, libraries and museums are important to the
historical and cultural memory of our nation.

As we are all aware, provinces do not have sufficient funds to carry out
this competence. The department probably needs to improve in this area. The
department will engage relevant stakeholders and explore the possibility of
providing some allocations as a conditional grant to municipalities for the
building and improvement of libraries.

A strong and economically healthy nation places emphasis on the
construction and maintenance of its facilities such as libraries, archival
buildings, museums and theatres. I am pleased to announce that the
department's capital works budget has grown by more than 100% in just one
year from R81 million to R168 million.

We are appreciative that people in the democratic South Africa have been
able to stand together as a nation united in diversity. One can proclaim
with confidence and pride that indeed the tide has turned.

Focusing on science and technology, I would like to thank Minister Mabandla
who drove the actions leading to the launch of the South african Reference
Group on Women in Science and Technology on 7 March this year, with the
support and leadership of Dr Ben Ngubane. This initiative, which he
championed, highlights the ongoing challenge of making science and
technology more applicable and accessible to the women of our nation.

Given that I have very limited time, I will thank the reference group for
the good work that it has done. I hope I will have another opportunity to
speak more on science and technology. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Deputy Minister. Hon
members, I wish to recognise Mr Rashied Lombard, the organiser of the North
Sea Jazz Festival, who is here with us. [Applause.]

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, the Deputy Minister spoke about Old Fort
prison, and I would just like to remind her that Afrikaners fighting for
freedom, like General de Wet, were also kept at that Old Fort, so it also
has sentimental value for us.

The other day I was standing in a queue at a government office. The English-
speaking woman behind the counter could not solve the problem of the Zulu-
speaking woman in front of me. The English woman got angry and arrogant. At
my request, they finally got hold of someone who could speak isiZulu. The
Zulu woman's face lit up and the problem was solved in seconds.

Sir, when you respect my language, you respect me. That is what dignity is
all about. We agree on most of the theory of the Government's language
policy. The Freedom Front has said so more than once. However, the citizens
out there experience a big difference between theory and practice. If you
study the instructions from Ministers on the language policy within their
departments, it differs from department to department.

If you must fill out a form at certain departments, it is only available in
English. Sir, that is against the Constitution. Part of this Minister's
responsibility is to help to implement section 6 of the Constitution. I
just want to read one part of it that says ``all official languages must
enjoy parity of esteem and must be treated equitably''.

As the Government, you either respect the Constitution and implement this
section or change the Constitution if you are not serious about languages.
With the ANC's two-thirds majority, they can now easily change these
language clauses, scrap the other languages and make English the only
official language. Then theory and practice would be in line as we
experience it every day.

Meneer, die dilemma in Suid-Afrika vir mense wat vir taal veg, soos die
Vryheidsfront, is dat jy jouself altyd in 'n wen-verloor posisie bevind.
Tree jy in en veg jy vir ander tale, word jy van paternalisme beskuldig en
vertel dat jy nie namens ander mag optree nie. Tree jy in net vir jou eie
taal, word jy beskuldig van selfsugtige eiebelang.

Meneer, die swart mense van Suid-Afrika sal waardelik nie vry wees voordat
hulle ook nie kultureel vry is nie; nie voordat hulle eie tale gelyk
behandel word nie. As Afrikaanssprekendes het ons daardie les in ons
geskiedenis op die harde manier geleer. Maar Meneer, swart mense self is
hulle grootse probleem. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Sir, the dilemma in South Africa for people who fight for language rights,
such as the Freedom Front, is that one always finds oneself in a win-lose
situation. If one intervenes and fights for other languages, one is accused
of being paternalistic and it is said that one should not be allowed to act
on behalf of others. If one only intervenes for one's own language, one is
accused of selfish selfinterest.

Sir, the blacks in South Africa will not truly be free before they are also
culturally free; not before their own languages receive equal treatment. As
Afrikaans-speaking people, we have learnt that lesson in our history the
hard way. But Sir, black people themselves are their own biggest problem.]

What is meant by the saying black is beautiful, if we cannot see beauty in
the black languages? Deputy Minister Mangena wrote in The Star on identity
and said that the education we receive is in a foreign language, the social
and cultural nuances and messages are foreign, but the sad thing is that
the educated African is so proud of his deculturisation. He tries hard to
put a distance between himself and the uneducated masses. The educated lot
are the worst cultural traitors you find; the African elite are often
strangers to their own people. And those are harsh words.

I was wrong when I said that the Government's planned legislation for a
language policy got lost in the corridors of the Union Buildings, and I'm
happy to say that it was approved by Cabinet, if I'm correct, on 12 March.
It was announced on 17 March. Our congratulations on this. And I would like
the Minister to give us some indication of the timeframes of implementing
this policy, because I think it is really a step forward, although we have
waited almost 10 years for that. My congratulations on that. Thank you.
Mrs N D MBOMBO: Mandibulise kuwe Mbomvu nabanye abantu abakhoyo apha, kunye
neNdlu ngokupheleleyo. Phambi kokuba ndithethe ngoMthetho oYilwayo ... [Let
me say, ``greetings to you, Mbomvu ''[clan name of the Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology] and the other people who are here, as well
as the entire House. Before I talk on the Bill ...]

... I would like to congratulate the organisers of the North Sea Jazz
Festival, which was the biggest and the most successful event so far and
also the organisers of the impeccable cultural display at the opening of
the Cricket World Cup, right here in Cape Town. [Applause.]

Sithi halala kubaququzeleli. Siyile emjuxuzweni, saguqa  ngamadolo.  Ndicela
ukukhuselwa, Sihlalo. [We commend the organisers.  We  went  to  the  dance,
though, and we did the dance called ``Guqa ngamadolo''.  [Interjections.]  I
ask for protection, Chair.]

It was a lovely event, but we had some frustrations ...

... Mbomvu, sisiwa ngapha nangapha, kodwa ke, ayinamsebenzi loo nto. I-ANC
iyawuxhasa lo Mthetho oYilwayo. Ndiza kuthetha ngamaziko obugcisa okanye
inkcubeko ekuhlaleni. Ezi ndawo mazibe ziindawo zokuphuhlisa amasiko
nezithethe zakwantu, apho kuvuselelwa iilwimi, kuxatyiswa neendlela zethu
zokuphila ... (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[... Mbomvu as we were sent backwards and forwards, but that doesn't
matter. The ANC supports this Bill. I am going to talk about community art
centres. These places must become locations to develop the customs and
traditions of the African people, where languages are revived and our ways
of life are respected ...]

... in line with the Stellenbosch resolutions.

Ingaba amasiko ethu abalulekile na?  Ewe  amasiko  ethu  abaluleke  kakhulu.
Kangangokuba kufuneka thina siwakhusele  ngenyameko,  njengenkukhu  ikhusela
amantshontsho ayo. Ke ezi ndawo ndithetha  ngazo  mayibe  ziindawo  zokwenza
oku,  sikhuthaze  nabantwana,  kanti  nathi  sikhuthale,  sifundise  abantu,
ngakumbi abahlala  ezilalini,  okokuba  ezi  ndawo  sizigcine  njani,  kwaye
ziluncedo kangakanani zona kubo.

Mayibe ziindawo ezinomtsalane kubakhenkethi, kutsho kuvuleke amathuba
emisebenzi, ze ikati isuke, kuhlale imbiza eziko, kuphele indlala
nobuhlwempu. Ezi ndawo, ke Mbomvu, kufanele zizise abakhenkethi kukhule
uqoqosho; ibe ziindawo ezakhelwe namhlanje nangomso. Kungabizizo iindawo
ezakhelwe abantu abathile; ibe ziindawo ezakhelwe abantu bonke, zibe
namaqula (swimming pools) okufunda ukudada nokudlala intenetya neqakamba,
imixhentso, indlamu, ukutyityimba nokucula; ibe ziindawo zokufunda ubugcisa
nemijuxuzo.

Xa ndithetha ngomculo thina sizwe esintsundu singoongqa phambili.
Ndikhumbula ngexesha ledompasi. Kwathiwa isizwe siyabizwa nguMabhude.
Abantu bahlangana befuna ukwazi okokuba uMabhude ubabizela ntoni na.
Wasiqokelela ndawonye uMabhude yintoni? Kwathiwa hayi uMabhude ...
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Are our customs important? Yes, our customs are very important, so much so
that we must protect them with diligence like a hen protecting its chicks.
So, these places that I refer to must be locations to do this, encouraging
the children also. We, too, must be diligent and educate people, especially
those living in the villages, on how we should keep these places and to
what extent they are of help to them.

They must become tourist attractions,  such  that  employment  opportunities
are opened up and so that hunger is defeated  and  food  is  placed  on  the
table. These places, Mbomvu, should draw tourists and bring about growth  in
the economy. They should be locations that are established for  the  present
and the future; they shouldn't be locations established for the elite,  they
should be locations established for everyone. They must have swimming  pools
for learning to swim, as well as facilities for playing tennis and  cricket,
for doing traditional dances of African origin,  dancing  by  quivering  the
body and singing; they should be locations to learn art and dances.

When talking about music, we, the African nation, are  leaders.  I  remember
during the dompas era, it was said that Mabhude summoned the nation.  People
got together and wanted to know why Mabhude gathered them at  one  spot.  It
was said: No, Mabhude ...]

... is going to tell you how beautiful you live when you have a dompas.

Sabizana, yaye ndandisafunda ngelo xesha. Babuza apha kum ootata okokuba
yintoni le. Ndathi mna yimithetho yedompas. Kuthiwa niza kuphatha amapasi.
Abanye babe ngayazi okokuba liyintoni na ipasi. Kodwa Mbomvu, sathi sifika
kwaMabhude yabe ingoma isitsho ngasemva. Phambi kokuba sifike, wabe ewuvile
umyaleza. Sabe sisitsho sisithi `nimxelel' uMabhude, nith' amaMpondo
awayifun' idompasi. Sebeyithathile nje... '. Sathi sifike wabe sele evile
okokuba sithini. Ezi ndawo ke Mbomvu esixoxa ngazo kufanele ibe ziindawo
zokuxoxa iintsomi. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[We called each other. I was at school then. My father and other men asked
me what this about. I said these were dompas laws. It is said you are going
to carry the dompas. Others had no idea what a dompas was. But, Mbomvu, by
the time we got to Mabhude's place, the song sounded at the back. He got
the message even before we arrived. We were saying, ``Tell Mabhude and say
the Pondos do not want the dompas, although they have received it''. By the
time we arrived, he had heard what we were saying. These locations we are
talking about, Mbomvu, should be places to relate fairytales.]

But not bedtime stories this time ... Zixoxwe emini, wonke umntu ekhona.
Namabali, iindawo zokuzibuyisa izimilo, ukuze siyazi imvelaphi yethu.
Singajongeli phantsi amasiko ethu sixabise awabanye abantu, kubekho
neendawo zokufunda kwabantu abadala, ze ecaleni kwezi ndawo okanye kwalapha
ngaphakathi, kubekho indawo yokuthengisa okuya ethunjini, amathala
eencwadi, i-IT kunye neekompyutha ukuze ezi ndawo zoluntu zibe likhaya
lokufuna ulwazi neendlela zokuthumela imisebenzi kwamanye amazwe.

Kufuneka ibe ziindawo apho sifundisa abantwana nezizukulwana zethu
nangokutya kwethu neendlela esipheka ngazo, kunye nendlela esicoca ngayo
njengokusinda ngobulongwe. Niza kundixolela bantu. Umzukulwana wam ngathuba
lithile ndisekhaya eMpuma Koloni wafika kum ephatheke kakubi kakhulu. Wathi
makhulu uNobomvu ... (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Let these and other  stories  be  told  during  daytime  at  rehabilitation
centres so that we know our background, so that we don't look down upon  our
traditions and revere those of other people.  There  should  be  places  for
adult learning, and then next to these, or even  inside,  places  that  sell
meals, as well as libraries, and IT and computer centres should be  set  up;
these community centres should be homes from which  to  seek  knowledge  and
ways to export works to other countries.

Let them be places where we teach our children and grandchildren even  about
our food, how we cook and how we clean, as is the  case  when  smearing  wet
cowdung onto the floor. You will please pardon me, people.  When  I  was  in
the Eastern Cape at  some  stage,  my  grandchild  came  up  to  me,  deeply
distressed, and said: ``Granny, Nobomvu ...]

... ugcobisa indlu yakho ngamasimba. Ngithi mina `ngamasimba?' Athi: yebo
lamasimb' eenkomo. (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[... is smearing your house with faeces. I said  ``faeces?''  And  he  said:
``Yes, the faeces of the cow.'']

Uyabona okokuba maxa wambi siba ``artificial unnecessarily''. Kuba nyani
wayengabazi ubulongwe. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Can you see that we become artificial sometimes? Because it is true that
he did not know cowdung.]
Uma siphekile ngamalongwe uye athi ``Yini nipheka ngasimba''? (Translation
of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[Even if we cook by means of the use of dried cowdung he would ask, ``Why
do you cook with faeces?’’]

Ke ezi ndawo mazibe ziindawo zokuthi sifundise sifundisane amasiko
neendlela zethu zokuphila nento yokuba kudala sasifudula siphila njani.

Ingathi kwezi ndawo bekunokuba khona izindlu zakwaNtu. Ezi zindlu ekuthiwa
ngesiXhosa ``ngoongquphantsi''. Zaziba nazo izitulo ekuthwa ngusoze isitulo
sodaka. Atsho amaXhosa xa ethetha athi `soze isitulo sodaka'. Ngoba
asophuki, asinjani, sihlala sinjalo. Ingathi besingakhelwa izindlu
ezinjalo, sigcine izithethe zethu.

Kambe ke Mbomvu nawe Hlubikazi, akukubanga kwaphela. UMbomvu uyandi
phazamisa qabane uSihlalo. ... Ezi zinto ndithetha ngazo ziyenzeka kwezinye
iindawo. Ndicela ke okokuba zongezwe, ngakumbi emaphandleni. Abantu baqonde
ngazo, bafundiswe, batsho babone okokuba uRhulumente nguRhulumente wabantu.
Lo Rhulumente lo uya kuzisa akuthunyiweyo, ngokwesithembiso sakhe. [Laphela
ixesha.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[So let these be places to educate us with regard to one another's cultures
and ways of living, as well as how we used to live in the olden days.

It would appear that there could be African traditional houses at these
places. These houses are called in isiXhosa, ``ungquphantsi'' [circular
grass houses that are firmly fixed to the ground through the use of
saplings]. Such houses used to have the kind of chairs called ``uSoze,
isitulo sodaka'' [the never-ever, a dried-mud chair]. That is what the
Xhosa people say when they talk, because that chair doesn't break, it
remains the same. It stays like that. It would appear that such houses
could be built for us to preserve our tradition.

However, Mbomvu, and you, Hlubikazi [clan name of the Deputy Minister of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology] all is not that bad ... Comrade
Chair, Mbomvu is intimidating me! These things which I am referring to do
happen in other places. I ask that they be augmented, especially in rural
areas, in order for people to have more understanding about them; that they
be taught so as to make them see that Government is the Government of the
people. This Government, in line with its promise, does deliver what it is
mandated to do. [Time expired.]]

(Translation of Tswana paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs M A SEECO: Chairperson and hon members of Parliament, one of the units
of the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology is the National
Terminology Service.

The UCDP supports this budget because it can improve the interpreting
service. Some of the department's aims is to develop science education at
technikon level. There is a wide belief that our children find mathematics
and science difficult. The department should find a way to help junior
schools with science facilities, particularly in the rural areas, because
we should make hay while the sun shines.

This budget will encourage children, adults and the disabled who are good
at working with their hands, provided we build them the proper facilities
to practise their trades. Our youth's musical groups also need support.]

The allocation includes nonrecurring expenditure in respect of
infrastructure development, including the establishment of Freedom Park as
well as the allocations from the Poverty Relief Fund of R48 million in 2002
and 2003, and R64 million in 2003 and 2004. The main features of programme
2 of the department's Budget Vote is to improve the quality of life of
South Africans, through access and the advancement of technology, including
the use of indigenous knowledge.

Business is the central driving force for improving the quality of life of
South Africans. It is therefore essential that incentives and support be
provided to the business sector if it is to meet the new challenges of
increasingly competitive markets. The French national assembly voted
unanimously on 21 February 2002 to repatriate the remains of Sarah Baartman
to South Africa. This nation has to show appreciation to Minister Brigitte
Mabandla, who was the Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture, and hon Minister
Ben Ngubane also needs to be applauded for that.

Support should be given for the creation, development and sustaining of
microenterprises and small businesses, which contribute approximately 42%
of South Africa's GDP and employs half the private sector workforce. I
thank you. [Applause.]

Prof I J MOHAMED: Chairperson, I rise to support the Budget Vote, on behalf
of the ANC, of the Department of Science and Technology. The ANC has taken
great strides since creating a Department of Arts, Culture, Science and
Technology in 1994. Now the Department of Science and Technology has been
created to fully focus on technological advancement and a vibrant economy
to address the poverty problem.

Hon Minister, Dr Ben Ngubane, hon Deputy Minister, Ms Buyelwa Sonjica, and
Director-General Dr Adam, congratulations on your new Department of Science
and Technology, a department which focuses on addressing advancing science
and technology and creating institutions which will support the development
of technological industries. This department will create the infrastructure
with the capacity and dedication to draw together and integrate the
management of innovation, incubation and diffuse initiatives in the
country.

These in turn support the economic growth of South Africa, and hence work
towards bringing the poor and marginalised into the mainstream of the
economy and society. Like you, we are concerned that the investment in
Gross Economic Research and Development, (GERD) as a proportion of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), dropped from 1,1% in 1999 to 0,7% in 2001.
This was at a time when the European countries' GERD/GDP ratio was 2,15%,
and we understand they are now aiming at 3%. We believe that with new
strategies in place, expenditure on R&D has since increased and hence also
the GERD/GDP ratio.

Like you, we are concerned that our researchers, technicians and scientists
are ageing, a sign that we are not effectively producing new and sufficient
human expertise to ensure South Africa's ability to innovate. Similarly, we
are concerned that the number of women and historically disadvantaged
persons taking up careers in science is growing at too slow a pace. The
challenge of a demographically representative S&T workforce is becoming
increasingly more serious, and requires a creative solution. My comrade Ms
Makasi will elaborate further on this matter.

It is a major concern that Government investment in R&D has dropped. We
notice the concurrent drop in private sector investment in R&D in South
Africa. It appears that these companies are choosing instead to make this
investment abroad with their principles. The DST will address this concern
and encourage the industries to invest in R&D locally.
A key tool the department has developed to increase our nation's
competitiveness is the National Research and Development Strategy, adopted
by Cabinet in 2002. This strategy aims to enhance the national system of
innovation. It focuses on human resource development, as wealth and
employment creation, bringing innovation to the fore and facilitating
science and technology performance across Government, ultimately with the
aim of delivering economic growth and improved quality of life. The
National R&D Strategy is premised on a doubling of the R&D expenditure over
the next three years. The DST did not get sufficient funding for this in
its budget allocation. This is a critical challenge, as now the planned
programme will have to stretch over a six-year to seven-year period, and
the competitive advantage sought will be delayed.

This implies a setback for the increased GERD/GDP ratio and consequent
competitiveness that we had hoped for. This will also mean that we will lag
even further behind the European countries, South Korea and others. To
harness resources, we look to DST to enable the closest possible co-
operation with partners in Government, science councils, higher education
institutions, and the private sector to ensure maximum output through the
creative meeting of minds. We welcome the report that the DST will continue
to negotiate with State Expenditure to release further funds to effectively
enable the strategy.

We know that the DST will continue to work closely with the science
councils and that their programmes will be aligned with the National
Research and Development Strategy. The budget allocation of the DST has
grown by 32,1% from last year's R1,03 billion, and will increase to R1,36
billion by the end of the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework period. We note
that 92,6% of the DST's budget allocation is for transfer payments and the
number of personnel in the DST will increase by 92,5%. These are
substantial increases. It is imperative to ensure that appropriate, skilled
capacity is deployed, that well-structured programmes are developed to
effectively utilise these funds, and that they are monitored to ensure
delivery of set objectives.

The Science and Technology for Competitiveness Programme is the biggest
programme of the DST. It enables and drives the key technology missions in
the R&D strategy in collaboration with the Government research system, the
private sector and higher education. It is the stated intention of the DST
to incorporate these science and technology institutions into the Science
Vote.

This will enlarge the pool of institutions doing research and development
work in support of the National R&D strategy. This programme is allocated
R745,1 million, 72,3% of the DST budget allocation. This is very
appropriate as the Science and Technology for Competitiveness Programme
will be a crucial driver of innovation. Its efforts to increase state R&D
expenditure is vital to achieve the objectives of the National System of
Innovation. The department states that this programme will also help in the
establishment of centres of excellence in research and teaching.

Centres of excellence bring to mind a space staffed by top scientists with
excellent research records and advanced programmes for training masters and
doctorate students in scientific research and development. These centres
will also have sophisticated scientific equipment. Technology for
development is the second largest programme in the department. It will
focus on improving quality of life through the access to and the spread of
technology. It also aims to create the capacity and skills for innovation
and the use of indigenous knowledge.

Chairperson, my comrade Ms Hloni Mpaka will speak further on this
programme, and therefore I will not say anything on this, save that the
uniting of indigenous knowledge and science and technology will lead to
innovative projects and products which will address the issue of job
creation and the alleviation of poverty.

We also congratulate the CSIR and South African San Council who have
reached an agreement on sharing the benefits of the potential commercial
success of a CSIR patent, related to the Hoodia plant. If clinical trials
are successful, P57, as it is now known, will form the basis of a new
obesity treatment. This benefit-sharing model ensures that the San will
receive equitable benefits if the drug is successfully commercialised. A
pharmaceutical company has expressed an interest in marketing the drug.

Still on partnership, we commend the MRC and the CSIR for the development
of an ultrasonic device that can be used to diagnose placental function.
Widespread application of this technology could save the lives of 3 200
children per annum in South Africa alone. Funding will also be directed to
the Godisa and Tshumisano programmes. The Godisa Technology Transfer
Programme is responsible for incubation projects. The Tshumisano project,
of which seven stations are currently operational, creates technology
stations in the technikons.

We note the steady growth targets you set, and look forward to their
expansion. The allocation to this programme is up by R115,2 million over
the last year's allocation. It is worth noting that R110,4 million goes to
poverty reduction. That is, 56,1% goes to poverty reduction and the
balance, 43,9%, to technology transfer. It is fairly clear how technology
transfer could take place through technology stations in technical colleges
and other institutions. On the other hand, apart from the cryptic
description above, there is no clear indication of how poverty reduction
will take place.

Indeed, there are no measurable objectives and outputs as required by the
Public Finance Management Act that I have seen. It is stated that, over the
medium term, the programme will receive significant increased allocations.
The National Research Development Strategy will target poverty fairly
directly. We commend you, Mr Minister, on the provision of a framework for
the development of the biotechnology strategy. This year we look forward to
the implementation. We eagerly anticipate the establishment of the three
regional innovation centres, the national bioinformatics facility and a
biotechnology public awareness programme.

I congratulate the Ministry and department on a well-planned and targeted
budget, and will follow with interest its progress and the ultimate
realisation of set objectives. We have confidence that you will succeed in
developing appropriate programmes in pursuit of a better life for all. We
also wish you well with your ongoing negotiations with State Expenditure to
leverage more funds for meeting the goals of the National Research and
Development Strategy in the shortest possible time. I thank you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, the PAC supports the Budget Vote on Arts and
Culture, but allow me to make a few remarks on culture. We must intensify
our cultural struggle as a tool for mental liberation. Colonialism did much
harm to our minds. Yes, Africans must learn from other people but they must
not discard their own cultural values. The African people can save
themselves. They, however, will not save themselves if they do not decide
where they are going, understand where they have been and where they are.

As Africans on the continent of Africa, with few exceptions, we must
acknowledge that we have made serious mistakes. We overthrew colonial rule
but adopted colonial values and norms. This mimicry has made us custodians
of eurocentric cultural values. It makes it difficult for us to decolonise
our minds and to rediscover our afrocentric view of the world which
prevailed before the transatlantic slave trade and the Berlin Conference.

In reality, we are torn away from our past. We continue to be propelled
into a universe fashioned from the outside, a universe which suppresses our
values. We are still dumbfounded by a cultural invasion that marginalises
us and makes us economic slaves in our own country.

The African people are today the deformed reflection of the image of
others. The coloniser has made our continent the paradise of his
eurocentric and economic domain. Thus we live for the outside world. It is
from the outside world that we receive our concepts and ideas. We need to
do research into our African epistemology, politically, medicinally,
philosophically, economically and technologically. For instance, socialism
which is frowned upon today in the traditional economic system of the
African people can be modified to suit present conditions, but the rampant
capitalism in this country is speedily burying the African people alive
economically and submerging them in perpetual poverty. [Interjections.]

Let me express my appreciation for the efforts made by the Minister of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, but say that much more needs to be
done. We should not value the rights of homosexuals, prostitutes and
abortionists while traditional leaders' rights are trampled underfoot, and
there is resistance to amend the Constitution to correct this abnormality.

The monument erected to the martyrs of the Sharpeville uprising and recent
attention to their graves is appreciated, but the graves of our martyrs who
died in Langa must be attended to.

[The PAC will never allow the African nation to be subjected to oppression
and pretence, of the conquered leadership. We are always ready and we are
not intimidated by crowds that are easily misled, or traitors. We align
ourselves with our heroes who shed their blood to free this nation, the
same nation that is being abused today. I therefore say,-

  The rhino which has just defeated others on the battlefied
  High up in the mountain and down through the valley
  Where a warrior and his horse die
  Where horses leave their riders
  When the spears are taking lives.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. Minister and Deputy Minister, over
the past years the realisation of the entertaining benefits of arts and
culture has been enriched. The department has the important function of
preserving the national symbols of South Africa, ensuring that they are
representative of South African people and South Africa as a whole. Being
home to a diverse population, the arts culture exhibited by us is rich and
inspiring from a nation once divided and segregated according to the colour
and, in turn, culture.

However, the MF notes that the department's functions are not restricted to
theatre and entertainment, as the title may mislead one to think. The
department leads important programme initiatives such as the Legacy
Projects. The department plays a part in bridging the gap by making
education and training accessible to all, so that South Africans from all
walks of life are able to invest in a career within the sector.

The department's functions are broad and manage a cultural and industrious
growth strategy that involves arts festivals, theatre, music, dance, visual
arts, photography, architecture, rock art, crafts, design, literature and
film. These are globally competitive and it is hard for the department to
ensure that they are in line with global standards.

South Africa though has many talented persons in the fields mentioned and
the MF is in no doubt that we perform superbly. However, the industry has
not seen as many Indians drawn in and the MF suggests that a stronger
magnet be placed to attract and draw in persons from various backgrounds
into the sector so as to display an equitable representation of South
African citizenry.

The MF also notes the department's challenge to not only manage science and
technology within South Africa, but to keep abreast of global advancement
and to pursue ways to bring South Africa in line with that. The department
is given the duty of keeping the Government up to date with science and
technology and is advised by the National System of Innovation.

At the end of the day we as Government and anybody under our employ are
answerable to our citizenry. Noting this, the department's efforts in
ensuring public awareness is evident via the Puset project. The
Shuttleworth experience has been a great contribution and magnet to the
field, as we note that after his trip Shuttleworth went to schools and
various institutions to relay his experience. This is exceptionally
beneficial to introducing our youth to education and training in the sector
and perhaps rouse ambitions so that people will be attracted to that
sector.
The budget for the department is appropriate, and the MF is confident that
it will be utilised wisely by the department for the development and
advancement of arts, culture, science and technology in South Africa. The
MF supports the budget for Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. Thank
you, Chairperson.

[Bishop L T TOLO: The hon Chairperson, Speaker, The Minister of Arts,
Culture, Science and Technology, Dr Ngubane, Deputy Minister, Mrs Sonjica
in Sepedi we say: Greetings!

I would like to thank the President, the hon Mr Mbeki, for choosing the
Minister and a sister to be his deputy. He did well because women are
mothers of the nation. A child is not born because of a woman alone. A
child is born because of the bond between a man and a woman and they will
teach the child their language. Because the Minister and the Deputy are the
leaders of this Department, they speak the honest fact; he chose you very
well, Dr Ngubane.

We talk about our culture which is very important. Genesis Chapter 1 shows
clearly that God created a human being and then gave him a partner, culture
and various languages. In that way, my people, we were given our important
and respectable culture.

If we can follow our culture, the HIV/Aids disease will be quickly
eliminated. The cure to the HIV/Aids pandemic is to return to our culture
because in our culture a girl cannot have sex with a boy, or a boy have sex
with a girl, before marriage. It is true. We had real ladies and gentlemen.
When I was in love with a girl, we could not get into bed before we were
married. This means that if our children can follow after us, behave well
and respect their cultural norms, the HIV/Aids pandemic can end quickly.

People, culture is very important. When I grew up my people knew how to
create rainfall. It is our cultural science. We could make rain fall and
speak to God to make the rain fall. We could tell by studying the positions
of stars whether we would have rain or El Niño in a particular year. I am a
priest and I want to illustrate how religion estranged us from our culture.
My wife used to wear traditionally knitted dresses but when I married her
in the apostolic church she was prevented from wearing the traditional
dress because the church regarded it as the dress of atheists. My trousers
were not rejected because they were tailored by a Westernised person. This
clearly shows that religion undermined our culture.

Our African doctors are called witchdoctors or "toordokters" and even some
Africans call them witches. It is not true. Matthew 9:12 states that a sick
person is the one who needs a doctor. 1 Corinthians 12 states that ``God
gave some people wisdom to heal.''

A certain witchdoctor who used biological weapons infested our river with
poison and we suffered itching skin rashes. The doctor wanted cholera to
kill Africans. If he was black he would be called a witchdoctor.

I do not accept the title ``traditional healers'' because they are doctors
like Western doctors.

According to the book of Galatians, if a person bewitches by poisoning
food, it is a criminal offence. When reading Genesis the new testament
started at BC 6, when Jesus was born in European countries while the Old
Testament started in Africa and addresses our culture.]

Ngikhuluma ngamadlozi. Uma unkosikazi wami engatholi mntwana, siyafuna
ukuthi izinyanga zakithi zimsebenze bese umntwana efika. [I am talking
about the ancestors. If my wife is unable to give birth to children, I
would want our traditional healers to doctor her so that she would be able
to have children.]

Ge monna le yena a sa hwetše ngwana dingaka tša segagaborena di a mmereka
gore a kgone go hwetša ngwana.

Seo se ra gore Testamente ya Kgale e dumela mekgwa ya seAfrika. Ge o ka
lebelela Testamente ye Mpsha, ga e nape e amogela mekgwa ya seAfrika, efela
Testamente ya Kgale, ka ge e dirilwe mo Afrika e a e amogela. Ke ka baka la

paragraphs follows.)

[I am talking about the ancestors. If my wife is unable to give birth to
children I would want our traditional healers to heal her so that she would
be able to have children.

If a man is impotent our doctors treat him so that he can father children.

That means the Old Testament accepts African customs. If you study the New
Testament, you will realise that it does not accept African customs. The
Old Testament which was written in Africa, accepts African customs. Why? I
want to prove that if we can respect our culture it is important.

I remind Mrs Van Wyk of the New NP that I do not forget white culture. When
I grew up in the 1950 and 1960s white women were wearing big hats and long
dresses that extended to the ground and men were wearing trousers with
belts at their pockets and hats. It was beautiful; now you have forgotten.
The day before yesterday I was impressed by the hon Mr McIntosh wearing a
``dress''. Yes, you did well, my man!
I hope we will all respect our important cultures. Genesis 17:10 writes
about circumcision. I know that some do not follow circumcision while
others do. Abraham was circumcised at the age of 99 with his son, Ishmael,
who was thirteen years old. In our culture a person who is circumcised is a
man amongst men and he must be respected. If we can all strengthen our
cultural norms, respect will increase and we will be united and be able to
defeat the diseases.

In short, I thank the hon Minister for asking us to preserve our culture
because it is beautiful. I started working in 1960. My name is Lekoba.
However, somebody said ... [Interjections.]]

En ek is nie 'n voertuig se ``jack'' nie. As jy praat van die ``jack'',
praat jy van die ding wat die voertuig optel as dit miskien 'n ``puncture''
gekry het. Met ander woorde, my ma en my pa het my my naam gegee; my naam
is Lekoba. Dankie aan die ANC. Hulle het pragtige werk gedoen. Almal van
ons respekteer kulture en ons kultuur. Die ANC doen dit en ons moet ook so
maak. As jy sê mnr McIntosh het sy tradisionele drag aangetrek met die
opening van die Parlement, dis nie jy nie. Dis die ANC wat dit vir hom gun.
[Applous.] Ek doen 'n beroep dat die mense van Suid-Afrika seker moet maak
dat hulle die ANC beskerm. Daardie ander party wat gaan kom, gaan maak dat
mnr McIntosh nie weer daardie ``skirt'' dra nie. [Gelag.]

Ek doen 'n beroep op die mense van Suid-Afrika dat die ANC beskerm moet
word. Ons is die goeie leiers. Mnr Aucamp en die VF praat van kulture, maar
ek het nog nooit hulle kultuur gesien nie. Kyk mense, ek praat die
waarheid. Julle vloek bietjie-bietjie, maar julle moet ons ondersteun, want
ons is die regte een wat so maak.

Laastens, in Exodus 7 gaan dit oor Moses en die arm broer wat die Here vir
hom gekies het, omdat die Jood die Egiptenaar daar moes aflos. [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[And I am not a vehicle's jack. When you talk about the jack, you are
talking about the thing which lifts the vehicle when it perhaps has a
puncture. In other words, my mother and my father gave me my name; my name
is Lekoba. Thank you to the ANC. They have done wonderful work. All of us
respect cultures and our culture. The ANC does this and we should do the
same. When you say that Mr McIntosh wore his traditional clothing to the
opening of Parliament, that is not you. It is the ANC that grants him that.
[Applause.] I want to make an appeal that the people of South Africa must
ensure that they protect the ANC. That other party which will come would
result in Mr McIntosh not wearing that skirt again. [Laughter.]

I want to appeal to the people of South Africa that the ANC should be
protected. We are the good leaders. Mr Aucamp and the FF talk about
culture, but I have never seen their culture. Look people, I am speaking
the truth. They curse every now and then, but they must support us, because
we are the right ones doing this.

Finally, in Exodus 7 it deals with Moses and the poor brother that the Lord
chose for him, because the Jew had to redeem the Egyptian there.
[Applause.]]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, they say that the day when the best kwaito
singer in the world is white and the best golfer is black and Germany does
not want to go to war is the day you know the world has changed.
[Laughter.] Indeed, the world has changed.

Globalisation has resulted in a street in Cape Town and a street in New
York or Taiwan tending to look the same, with its McDonald's and its Coca-
Cola, its cellphone shop and its Microsoft. In South Africa we are part of
this change, and even more so, part of a radical change in society since
1994; a change that can swing the pendulum and - that's a danger - from one
wrong to another; from a total isolation of cultures to the dissolving of
cultures; from separatism to a one-size-fits-all hegemony.

In dié verband is daar 'n paar rooi ligte - bepaalde wanklanke; hulle wat
my en my gemeenskap marginaliseer en vervreem. Ek noem enkeles daarvan.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ja, die absolute stormram van veranderinge van plekname,
die nuwe beleid oor godsdiensonderrig in skole, 'n Minister se weiering om
'n skool te besoek omdat daar 'n borsbeeld van Hendrik Verwoerd in die
portaal staan, 'n herrie op 'n kunstefees omdat 'n kunstenaar dit durf waag
het om Die Stem te sing. Wil jy nou glo!

Agb Minister, u departement het teen hierdie agtergrond 'n groot
verantwoordelikheid teenoor die wyse waarop die verskillende gemeenskappe
in Suid-Afrika binne hierdie klimaat van verandering 'n gedeelde lojaliteit
in hierdie land kan handhaaf, maar terselfdertyd die geborgenheid van 'n
eie kultuur, taal en godsdiens kan geniet.

Suid-Afrika is uniek. Vanweë die rykdom en verskeidenheid van sy kulture
bied ons 'n wêreld in een land. In watter land ter wêreld kan jy na van
boeremusiek tot kwaito luister, van simfonie-orkes tot operasang, tot die
trom en marimba van Afrika? Ons moet hierdie verskeidenheid voed en
koester. Ons moet oor en weer mekaar se kulture kan waardeer en respekteer.
Die een mag vir die ander nooit 'n bedreiging wees nie, veral nie oor
getalle nie. Daarvoor is die vlaktes in Suid-Afrika te oop en sy horisonne
te wyd. Ons mag nie toelaat dat kulturele imperialisme die unieke
eiesoortigheid van ons verskillende kultuurgemeenskappe verdring tot 'n
vaal en eentonige eendersheid nie.

Daarom, Minister, pleit die Nasionale Aksie dat ons die verskeidenheid in
groter mate verdiskonteer op die wyse waarop die staat ook kulturele
aktiwiteite subsidieer en mee help. Elke kultuurgemeenskap moet oor eie
strukture vir kuns en kultuur beskik, wat sonder inmenging van die sentrale
Regering bedryf word en gesubsidieer kan word. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[In this regard there are a few warning signs specific - notes of discord
which mariginalise and alienate my community and I. I will name but a few.
[Interjections.] Yes, the total rush to change names of the place, the new
policy with regard to religious instruction in schools, a Minister refusing
to visit a school because there is a bust of Hendrik Verwoerd in the
hallway, an uproar at an arts festival because of an artist who has dared
to sing Die Stem. Can you believe it?

Hon Minister, against this background, your department has a big
responsibility towards the way in which different communities in South
Africa can maintain a shared loyalty within this country in this climate of
change, and yet at the same time, can enjoy the security of their own
culture, language and religion.

South Africa is unique. Owing to the richness and diversity of its cultures
we have a world in one country. In what other country in the world can one
listen to anything from ``boeremusiek'' to kwaito, from symphony orchestra
and opera music to the drum and marimba of Africa? We must nurture and
cherish this diversity. We must be able to mutually appreciate and respect
each other's cultures. The one may never pose a threat to the other,
particularly not on account of numbers. For that to happen, the plains of
South Africa are too open and its horizons too wide. We may not allow
cultural imperialism to usurp the unique distinctiveness of our various
cultural communities to become a grey and monotonous sameness.

Therefore, Minister, the National Action appeals for greater negotiation of
diversity, also in the manner in which the state subsidises and supports
cultural activities. Each cultural community must also have its own
structures for arts and culture at its disposal which can be operated and
subsidised without interference from central Government.]

The building blocks for real nation-building is a recognition of the
advancement of the different cultures in South Africa. One overall state
Department of Arts and Culture is not the answer. I want to make a plea to
devolve powers of Government on issues intimately involved with culture to
the community itself. The mission of the Department of Arts and Culture
should be to decentralise as much as possible, not only geographically, but
also culturally. This is in regard to the long overdue Commission for the
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and
Linguistic Communities. Section 185 which can play an important role in
establishing different cultural councils, as envisaged in this section, is
of the utmost importance in the promotion of the treasures of our
diversity. If the section 185 Commission could legally and financially
empower cultural communities which belong to civil society and empower them
to take control of their own affairs, it would be a positive step.

As gekyk word na die begroting van die departement, word daar gans te veel
geld spandeer aan groot nasionale feeste, terwyl die geleenthede vir
eiesoortige kulturele ekspressie deur die verskillende gemeenskappe
gemarginaliseer word. Ons moet onsself werklik die vraag afvra of ons nie
soms maar net lippediens bewys aan die erkenning van die multidimensionele
kenmerke van die Suid-Afrikaanse samelewing nie. (Translation of Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[When one looks at the budget of the department, far too much money is
being spent on large national festivals, whereas opportunities for
distinctive cultural expression by different communities are being
marginalised. We must really ask ourselves the question whether we are
occasionally only paying lip service to the acknowledgement of the
multidimensional characteristics of South African society.]

The National Arts Council's main task must be to facilitate the process in
such a way that every culture can blossom without the dominance of a forced
uniculturalism or globalism.

The Department of Arts and Culture, with the co-ordination of the section
185 commission is in a position to link South Africa in the full
realisation of the slogan of the coat of arms - Unity in Diversity. We dare
not fail this challenge. I thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, when a presentation was made at one of
the hearings on science and technology, I asked a question relating to
innovations that are characterised by unplanned and unco-ordinated township
and rural activities. I did this because in Azapo we are deeply worried
about scientific research and innovations that do not translate into useful
tools that the poor communities can access and use in order to change the
material circumstances in which they live.

The questions we have to ask are: Who are the beneficiaries of South
Africa's innovative scientific studies? Of what benefit are these studies
to the poor? Are our many scientists adequately researching areas that can
help us eradicate poverty and suffering?

Azapo is aware that to date many scientific studies that have been
conducted at various institutions of research in South Africa have
benefited the rich. Our belief is that this trend should not be allowed to
persist.

Whilst we say this, we should not be understood to be saying that all types
of scientific studies and innovations should only benefit the poor. On the
contrary, we are raising this in view of our country's commitment to the
eradication of poverty and other ills of society.

Azapo supports the stimulation of innovations through the National Advisory
Council on Innovation. We support the ARC studies that are geared at
helping small-scale farmers and rural communities in their struggle against
poverty. The point we are raising, though, is: How much of this research
and the results meant to benefit the poor can actually be accessed by the
poor?

Chairperson, most of the scientific knowledge is stored in some highly
technical language and the poor cannot access this. Thank you. [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Ms H M MPAKA: Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Minister and hon members,
it is a pleasure for me to support, on behalf of the ANC, the Budget Vote
of the Department of Science and Technology. I congratulate Mama Buyelwa
Sonjica on her appointment as Deputy Minister.

There is so much the department is doing. I think the Department of Science
and Technology is one of the best departments in spite of the huge task
confronting the Minister and the Deputy Minister. The activities of the
department cover a very wide range, much wider than many of us imagine,
including the MPs themselves. These activities range from overseeing to
financially supporting the work of the science councils.

Comparing the budget allocation to this plethora of responsibilities and
litany of programmes undertaken by the department, we can safely conclude
that the funds cannot be said to be adequate. The Government does need to
devise a strategy to allocate additional funds if these noble tasks are to
be carried out as expected, and as required. This observation is backed by
the fact that in almost all the presentations on the annual report by
stakeholders to the portfolio committee, the common complaint was that
policies could be better implemented if more funds were available.

However, it is encouraging to note that despite these limitations, the
budget allocation for science and technology has been revised upwards in
the current financial year. Notable also is the fact that science and
technology spending dominates the department's budget.

We in the ANC wish to congratulate the department on the strategic plan it
has set up to guide its programmes over the next few years. We acknowledge
the developments in science and technology in our country and work done
under very challenging circumstances. The strategy document outlines a
number of exciting possibilities and initiatives for South Africa. Just to
mention a few, the Department of Science and Technology, through its
agency, the Foundation for Education, Science and Technology, Fest,
launched a programme of public understanding of biotechnology, which aims
at promoting a clear understanding of the potential of biotechnology and to
ensure broad public awareness, dialogue and debate on its current and
potential future applications, including genetic modification.

As a result, the public understanding programme is calling for proposals
from individuals and organisations with proven capacity in innovative
science communication.

Their great achievement is especially true in the area of science and
technology. The use of strategic investments in science, therefore, is the
only big option that is open to the department and us as the nation. A
number of investors and entrepreneurs from the disadvantaged communities
have benefited from this programme, which is trying to address the fears of
the member of Azapo. New products have been developed, processes improved
and product quality significantly enhanced.

The budget document before us recognises the need to strengthen the crucial
links between strategic planning, budgeting, monitoring and, most
significantly, reporting on service delivery. If service delivery takes
place at a speedy and optimal level, we shall have the endorsement of the
voters and a valid argument for substantially increasing the budget of this
department. There are no grounds for complaints about a bigger share for
science and technology. I believe the role of science and technology, as
hon members will see, is very extensive and crucial and so this Budget Vote
should be increased substantially.

The science and technology programme is divided into four sub-programmes
with its tasks and achievements. The first programme is called ``Science,
Technology and Knowledge System Development and Maintenance'' which
supports science and technology policy formulation, creating working
systems and instruments for development. It transfers technology and
knowledge to various institutions.

We have the human resource development and upgrading of staff programme
which funds the Innovation Fund. The Poverty Relief Programme, as we all
know, challenges the massive poverty that faces our country, but the
Department of Science and Technology has made an effort in fighting poverty
through its partnership established with the CSIR and the Agricultural
Research Council.

Just to cite one example, there is a community in Eshowe that received
training in manual paper making technology. Now the community produces a
variety of paper-based products and generates a sizeable monthly revenue.
As a result of the new developed technologies in, among other things, paper
making, beekeeping, leather products and mohair production, other job
creation activities have been transferred to poor communities.

The Innovation Fund was created to focus on large-scale projects with a
significant research and development programme. The aim is to enhance the
efficiency of scientific and technological institutions, to improve the
quality and quantity of science and technology skills and produce advanced
production systems and products. For example, biologists, organic chemists
and gold- mining engineers were brought together by Mintek to develop
bioleaching. This recovers gold from gold-bearing orc by biochemical means
rather than purely nonorganic chemical means, which uses dangerous
chemicals.

Finally, Chairperson, I would like to commend the Minister and both
departments for being able to launch an indigenous music programme through
the Moses Taiwa Molelekwa Foundation in Tembisa on 21 March 2003. This
clearly shows the commitment made by this ANC-led Government to ensure that
the lives of the people of South Africa are improved. Thank you.
[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Chair, hon members, economic prosperity and progress is
unavoidably linked to science and technology. We need science and
technology to design and build new bridges, dams and roads. We need science
and technology to find cures to new diseases and viruses. We need science
and technology to throw off the shackles of apartheid and poverty, and to
claim our rightful place as a leading nation and continent in this world.

However, one of the largest problems facing science and technology in this
country, and hence the prosperity and wellbeing of each of our citizens in
this country, is research. These fall into two main areas: problems in the
area of the aging cohort of our research body; and problems in the amount
of money that, as a country, we are spending on research.
It is encouraging to note the hon Minister's admission that this country
faces considerable challenges in this regard in addressing the problems of
serious scientific skills shortages. The hon Minister has alluded to some
possible solutions such as school-level interventions and strengthening
tertiary education.

However, the question that needs to be asked is that of supply and demand.
Does South Africa have the capacity to produce the required number of
researchers in order to fulfil the needs and expectations of its citizens,
or is South Africa providing the necessary incentives for our researchers
to remain in this country? That is, are our researchers paid comparable
packages in an ever-increasingly globalised world? An example of this
failure is that the Agricultural Research Council told us recently that
they have been unable to give increases to their employees for the last
three years.

However, hon Minister, your solutions do not go far enough. What this
country needs and what this country demands is strong and definitive
leadership in this regard. This country needs to produce a hundredfold more
researchers and scientists in a very short period of time. We need to pay
them salaries that are comparable in a globalised village.

In this regard, we need to look no further than India to see how they have
achieved this. Less than 20 years ago, India was producing the same number
of Masters and Ph D researchers in the engineering field as South Africa.
Today India produces approximately 45 000 annually - almost 15 times more
than South Africa. The direct socioeconomic affect has been immeasurable
for India, with huge industries being developed in software development and
call centres.

As I mentioned earlier, another major problem that science and technology
and hence this country faces is the expenditure on research. It is
extremely disturbing to note that expenditure on science and technology
investment remains at a comparable low level of 0,17% of GDP as compared to
some countries where this figure is as high as 3%.

How are we as a country going to provide the stimulus for new industries
and improve existing industries if it remains at this level? How can South
Africa solve many of our unique problems if there is no investment in
science and technology? Admittedly, it is not solely the responsibility of
this department to increase this expenditure. However, this department
needs to bring other role-players to the table, such as the Departments of
Trade and Industry and Labour, and private industry.

This department needs to play a facilitatory role in ensuring South Africa
goes from being an underdeveloped country to a developing country, and
ultimately, to a developed country.

In conclusion, on a personal note, it is encouraging to see that the
Department of Science and Technology is one of a handful of government
departments that has achieved its target for equitable employment of
disabled individuals. This achievement is clearly shown. While the ANC-led
Government spouts forth its commitment to disabled people, when it comes to
real delivery, they pass their responsibility off on an IFP-led Ministry.

The ANC simply ignores the issues of disabled people. The ANC Government
expects disabled people to be grateful for what scraps they are thrown from
the generous table of their master. The ANC is missing the boat by not
recognising the amazing abilities that people with disabilities have
developed or utilising their very unique and specialised skills.

In addition, it must be recorded that this department's target of 2% of its
workforce being disabled individuals, when compared to the South African
disabled population of around 14%, falls embarrassingly and unacceptably
short.

I encourage the hon Minister to raise the bar, employ more disabled people
in your departments and utilise their very special and very unique skills,
and show the ANC Government what real transformation is all about. Thank
you. [Applause]

Ms X C MAKASI: Chairperson, hon Minister, Dr Ngubane, hon Deputy Minister,
Buyelwa Sonjica, hon members, on behalf of the ANC, I rise to support the
Budget Vote.

For such a long time, science and technology have been regarded as a man's
world, and as such women have been, in the most cases, discouraged from
taking up careers in the science and technology fields. As a result today,
in the private sector and public sector, positions of engineers,
technicians and researchers are occupied by men.

This is regarded as a problem and hence the National Advisory Council on
Innovation was set up to advise the Minister on strategies for the
implementation of the National Systems of Innovation. DACST produced the
National Research and Development Strategy, an important document to
address various issues which present a problem for science and technology
development and hence the growth of the economy. This NRDS document listed
a number of problems that prevent rapid economic development. Amongst these
issues is that of the ageing scientists, technicians and researchers who
are not replaced quickly enough by younger people. This results in the
decreasing output of scientific and technological research. In turn, our
industries lag behind those abroad; thus our industries become less
competitive.

Very few women, in particular black women and the historically
disadvantaged youth, have qualified in the science and technology field.
Even when they qualify in science and technology, very few stay in the
career.

Young girls and black youth have not found science and technology
attractive because of the level of the teaching in these areas at the
historically disadvantaged schools. This is so because their teachers in
turn were also disadvantaged.

Young black girls and youth, but particularly the girls, find it difficult
at the universities because they are not properly assisted. This requires
that students in engineering and science need to get on-the-job training
before they can be awarded a degree. Black women find it particularly
difficult to secure jobs for in-service training for a few months because
companies reserve these jobs for men, and white men in particular. This
means that they cannot complete their degrees since they do not get in-
service training. This is discrimination of the worst kind.

The Department of Trade and Industry launched a programme called Technology
for Women in Business in 1998. The mission of this programme is to enhance
the use of technology by women in business by means of recognising
outstanding achievements in this regard; identifying the generic success
and challenges of women entrepreneurs in the use of technology, and
building up a technology support system to encourage girls and young women
to choose careers in science and technology by means of the techno-girl and
girlchild programme; and to encourage solutions-based technology research
and respond to the needs of SMMEs managed or owned by women.

These are some of the programmes that show that the ANC-led Government is
really committed to redressing the imbalances created by the past and the
patriarchal society as it seeks to make sure that women really take their
deserving place in society and play a meaningful role in the development of
the growth of our country's economy.

In 2002, the National Science and Technology programme for young women was
launched by the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. This
programme aimed to provide girls with the opportunity to engage in an
innovative exciting hands-on programme in science and technology and
offered them ongoing follow-up support in order to interest and inspire
them into studying science at school level and further considering careers
in science, engineering and technology.

The target audience of this programme are girls who are doing Grade 6 to
Grade 10, which means girls from age 12 to 17, and they will be selected
from all nine provinces through the national criteria. These girls will be
coming from public schools that offer mathematics and science at the higher
grade level. These are some of the great strides that the department has
taken in exposing women to the world of technology at a tender age.

NgesiXhosa sithi: ``Lugotywa luselutsha.'' [In Xhosa we say: ``A child is
trained at a tender age''.]

While acknowledging the fact that there is no specific budget, these kinds
of programmes must also be encouraged through all other government
departments so that we can have balanced development, and enhance the
growth of development in our country.

The National Research and Development Strategy advocates the need for the
empowerment of women in the science, engineering and technology sectors in
order to enhance their involvement in contributing to South Africa's
economic development and growth. It also emphasises the need for special
programmes to address the demands of society in a responsive manner by
enhancing development in the science and technology field.

Women account for over half of the population and are essential partners  in
turning the tide against  poverty  through  the  development  of  innovative
strategies. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Nkk L  R  MBUYAZI:  Sihlalo  nendlu  ehloniphekile,  ngizokhuluma  ngaphansi
kukaVoti 18. Ngivumele  kuqala  ngiqale  ngokubonga  uNgqongqoshe  noMnyango
kulo Mnyango waMasiko nezoBuchwepheshe ngegalelo ababe  nalo  kulo  Mnyango,
nabo bonke  abebebambisene  nabo.  Ngifisa  nokubonga  uNkosazana  uBrigitte
Mabandla,  uNgqongqoshe  omusha  eMnyangweni  lo  asewuthathile  njengamanje
ngomsebenzi oncomekayo awenzile  wokulandela  nokubuyisa  udadewethu  uSarah
Baartman ukuba azophumula ezweni lakubo nelokhokho bakhe.

Ngifisa futhi ukufisela inhlanhla inkosazana  laphaya  engene  ezicathulweni
zakhe, iPhini likaNgqongqoshe, uBuyelwa  Sonyica.  Siyazi  ukuthi  inkonyane
isethuka isisinga, kodwa-ke uzojwayela nkosazana,  nokuthi-ke  uma  sikubona
thina  siyoma.  Njengamanjena-ke   asisezokomela   amanzi   kodwa   sesomele
ubuchwepheshe    ozobukhipha    kulo    mnyango    nolwazi    lwezobuSayensi
kwabesifazane.

Sihlalo  ngizogxila  ezindaweni  ezimbalwa  kule  nkulumo   yesabiwo   mali,
kwabesifazane kanye  nakwi-programme  2.  (Translation  of  Zulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson and honourable  House,  I  am  going  to  talk
about Vote No 18. Allow me first to thank the  Minister  of  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology for his role in this department,  and  all  those  he
works with. I also want to thank Ms Brigitte Mabandla, the new  Minister  in
the department that she is in now, for her good  work,  especially  that  of
bringing our sister Sarah Baartman to the country of her birth to  come  and
rest in it.

I would also like to express my good wishes to the lady who has come to
fill her position, the Deputy Minister, Buyelwa Sonjica. We know that she
is still new in the position, but she will get used to it. Another thing is
that when we see her, we become thirsty. At the moment, we are not thirsty
for water; we are thirsty for the science and knowledge that she is going
to bring to this department, particularly for women.
I will focus on many areas in this budget speech. I will focus on women and
on programme 2.]

The main features of programme 2 are to improve the quality of life of
South Africans through access to the advancement of technology. This
entails creating capacity and skills for innovations, and the use of
indigenous knowledge. The main focus in these areas are technology
transfers and poverty reduction.

The IFP welcomes the doubled allocation of funds in this programme from
R115 million to R232 million.

Umbuzo wami-ke ukuthi ngabe uMhlonishwa kulo mnyango uzokwazi yini
ukuthatha igxathi lokuqeda ububha ngokuthi alekelele ososayensi abasakhasa
ukuba bakwazi ukuziqalela awabo amabhizinisi amancane kanye nama-SMMES
ikakhulukazi abesifazane, intsha kanye nabakhubazekile ukuze bathole
ukuxhaswa? (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[My question is whether the Minister in this department will be able to
alleviate poverty by assisting small scientists so that they can start
their small businesses. In fact, will he be able to create new
entrepreneurs and SMMEs, especially with regard to women, youth and the
disabled people, so that they could be sponsored?]

On 26 August 2002, Deputy Minister Brigitte Mabandla chaired the Third
World Organisation for Women in Science (TWOWS). This was a panel
discussion on women's perceptions of science and technology for sustainable
development.

Sasilaphaya ukuze sikhulume ngokuthi izwe lisibuka kanjani njengabantu
besifazane kule misebenzi yobuchwepheshe nobusayensi. Abanye abantu
abakholwa ukuthi ugesi ungafakwa umuntu wesifazane. Abanye abakholwa ukuthi
ibhanoyi seliyakwazi ukuthi lishayelwe ngumuntu wesifazane. Abakholwa
ukuthi umuntu wesifazane engakwazi ukuphasisa uhlaka lwesakhiwo sendlu.
Abanye abakholwa ukuthi imoto iphephile uma ishayelwa nje umuntu
wesifazane. Baze basho uma kwenzeka iphutha bathi kusho ukuthi bekushayela
umuntu wesifazane. Bayaye bajabhe uma sebethola ukuthi kanti bekungenye
yamadoda ebishayela.  (Translation of Zulu paragraph follows.)

[We were there to discuss how the world perceives women in the areas of
science and technology. Some people do not believe that a woman can be an
electrician. Others do not believe that a woman can be a pilot. They do not
believe that a house plan can be approved by a woman. Some people believe
that it is not safe for a woman to drive. When an accident happens, they
even say that it is because the driver was a woman, and are disappointed
when they find that, in actuality, the driver was a man.]

I am glad to say that on 7 March 2003 the Deputy Minister announced the
launch of the South African Reference Group on Women in Science and
Technology (SARG). We hope that this will empower women in the science,
engineering and technology sectors in order to enhance their involvement in
contributing to South Africa's economic development and growth.

Women comprise over half of the population and are essential partners in
turning the tide against poverty through the development of innovative
technology.

Ngifisa ukubongela izingane zethu esezingochwepheshe kwezobusayensi,
ubunjiniyela nobuciko. Ngifisa ukuzibongela zonke kodwa ikakhulukazi
ezamantombazane, esezikwazi ukushayela amabhanoyi, imikhumbi,
esezingodokotela, ezisemikhakheni yogesi, kwezokwakha kanye nezokufunda
isimo sezulu.

Ngithanda futhi ukuthinta nasolwazini lwendabuko. Ngabe umnyango uke
ukuqaphele nje ukuxhashazwa kwabantu abadala abanolwazi olunzulu ngezinto
ezithile? Kuye kusuke abantu abathile baye emakhaya bephelezela abanye
bafike bathekele ulwazi maqede bakhohlise lowo muntu omdala mhlawumbe ngo-
R50,00. Babuyele emuva bese bona beyobhala emabhukwini amakhulu, kubhalwe
phansi amagama abo athole ukuthi aziwe nasemabhukwini amakhulu bese kude
kuthiwa ubani wathola ikhambi elithile kanti ulilande laphaya phansi
kwesihlahla kumuntu omdala. Lokho-ke kuwukuxhaphazeka kwabantu abadala
basemakhaya.

Sifisa ukuthi umnyango ubabheke labo bantu abathola udumo ngabanye abantu.
Kukhona-ke futhi abanye abantu abanolwazi lwezinto ezithile kulo ulwazi
lwendabuko. Ngizobala okumbalwa ngoba okunye bakuthintile.

Kukhona ukuthi kugaywe ukudla kwesiZulu, ummbila uxutshwe namantongomane
kube wukudla nje umuntu angakudla indlela yonke, okuwukudla okungaboli.
Okunye kokudla okukhona lokho ukudla okunomsoco kodwa futhi okwenza umuntu
akhule. Indlela okwakuphekwa ngayo, kwakubiliswa, kubekwe amathanga phezu
kommbila. Umuntu wayedla kahle ukudla kungazange kuphume umsoco.

Ngithanda nokubala izindlela zomhlabathi ukuthi abantu banolwazi
ngomhlabathi njengokuthi bakutshele ukuthi kule ndawo ungakwazi ukutshala,
kodwa ngeke umakhise umuntu kule ndawo ngoba ayilungele ukwakhiwa.

Kukhona futhi eminye imithi eyaziwa abantu bakithi. Uma umuntu ephuke
ithambo sinendlela yokuthi lixhunywe libuyele endaweni yalo. Lokhu kwenziwa
ngomhlabelo. Ngabe uMnyango uke uwubheke nje ukuthi umhlabelo lo
unomsebenzi omkhulu kangakanani? Ngakho-ke uma kukhulunywa ngolwazi
lwendabuko, nawo awucwaningwe bese kwakhiwa nomkhandlu wabo laba bantu
abanolwazi oluthile ngoba phela bakhona ezindaweni kuzo zonke izifundazwe.

Ubaba laphaya uke wathinta indaba yokuthi sinolwazi ngezinkanyezi ukuthi
inkanyezi ethile isho ukuthini, njengokuthi indonsa isho ukuthini. Ngakho-
ke luningi ulwazi oluphethwe abantu bakithi laphaya emakhaya.

Siyayisekela ... [Kwaphela isikhathi.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs
follows.)

[I would like to say congratulations to our children who are now
scientists, engineers and artists. I would like to say congratulations to
all of them, especially the female children who are now pilots, captains of
ships, doctors, electricians and climatologists.

I also want to talk briefly about indigenous knowledge. Has the department
noticed the extent to which our elders who are experts in indigenous
knowledge are exploited? Some people accompany researchers to the rural
areas to search for knowledge from the people there. They would just pay
the informant R50,00. Then they would go back and write huge books. Their
names would be popular because they would be in big books. People would say
so, and discover that all the while he was in fact using the knowledge he
got from an elderly person in the rural areas. That is how the elderly
people in the rural areas are exploited. We would like to ask the
department to watch out for people who obtain popularity through those
means.

There are people who are experts in certain areas of indigenous knowledge.
I am going to mention a few areas of indigenous knowledge here because
other areas have already been mentioned.

There was a method of cooking in which a Zulu food would be ground up. The
mealies would be mixed with groundnuts to make ``padkos'' that one would
eat all the way without the food going stale. Those are some of the kinds
of food that we have and which are grown. The way it was cooked was to boil
the mealies and put some pumpkin on top of the mealies. One would eat food
that had not lost its nutrients.

I would like to mention the types of knowledge that our people have about
soil. They can tell one that one can grow crops here and that one cannot
erect a building there because the soil is not good for that.

There are also some medicines in which our people are experts. If one had
had broken a bone, they were able to fix it. They would fix it with
umhlabelo medicine. Has the department done research into how useful the
umhlabelo medicine is? Therefore, when we talk about indigenous knowledge,
the umhlabelo must also be researched and a council of experts in
indigenous knowledge should be formed, because we have these people in all
our provinces.

My father over there said something about the knowledge of stars. He said
something about what a certain star represents, for instance, about the
indonsa star and what it represents. Therefore, our people there in the
rural areas have a lot of knowledge.

We support ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr E N NGCOBO: Thank you, Chairperson. Firstly allow me to thank the hon
Minister for presenting his budget today. I stand here on behalf of the ANC
to support the Budget Vote on the Science and Technology Appropriation
Bill. Allow me also to congratulate the Deputy Minister on her new
appointment to this challenging job. Science and Technology is a very
challenging job, but with effort you will achieve results.

Hon members, guests of Parliament, on behalf of the ANC, I support the
Budget Vote for the following reasons: The Vote is based on the National
Research and Development Strategy as approved in 2002 by the Cabinet with a
clear vision of alleviating poverty, and the enhancement of freedom among
our suffering masses.

Through a variety of interventionist programmes such as Godisa and
Tshumisano, the Pumani papermaking project, and biotechnology centres in
some provinces, South Africa is being taken into world centres of
excellence such as the Nonaligned Movement Science and Technology Centre in
India and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and
Biotechnology in Italy, where we are very close to cloning human beings;
and that happens at these centres, just to mention a few points. South
Africa's biotechnological potential is being shown that it is people-
centred and on the verge of an irreversible rise from the ashes of the
apartheid isolation from the world community of progressive nations.

On the question of taking science and technology back to the people, the
department has also done well so far. This is seen and witnessed by the
promotion of the Public Communication of Science and Technology programme,
and the testimony to this fact is the seventh international congress that
was recently hosted at the University of Cape Town in December 2002, via
the Foundation for Education in Science and Technology, Fest, an organ of
the Department of Science and Technology, in which 42 nations of the world
participated. Another similar programme which the Government has also
initiated is Public Understanding of Science, Engineering and Technology,
Puset, aimed at popularising technical sciences with our masses.

Most important of all is the promotion of information and communication
technology as a tool for the new working order of Government, aimed at
bridging the gap between the people and the various institutions of
government, including Parliament. This has mutual benefits for both the
Government and the people on the ground in that the ICTs are cheaper and
quicker than human-executed processes for the storing, processing,
outputting and transmitting of information. Over and above the above-
mentioned benefits, firstly, they can lead to faster and more transparent
decision-making; secondly, innovative e-government can demonstrate the
benefits of ICTs to the wider population, thus catalysing the ICT industry
and encouraging foreign investments; thirdly, civil servants can be better
motivated and the civil service can improve its public image through
information and communication technologies, and, fourthly, when citizens
are able to access information and understand the workings of Government,
the scope of corruption can be reduced.

Among the potentially repeatable success stories in the adoption of ICTs in
developing countries are, for example, Egypt, where a comprehensive
national database has provided an accurate and cost-effective basis for
issuing national ID cards.

Secondly, there is Tanzania, where Internet-enabled systems for civil
service financial management are being rolled out countrywide.

Thirdly, in India, village entrepreneurs run cyberkiosks. They go online on
behalf of clients, help them talk to customers and officials and thus
bridge the gap between cyberspace and rural life.

There are many such important developments based on e-government which have
taken place in the world, especially in the developing countries. In a
nutshell, e-governance will lead to e-administration which will connect e-
citizens with e-services, thereby building an e-society which will no doubt
be globally competitive. This will mark the greatest achievement by the
Department of Science and Technology as well as that of the ANC-led
Government.

The quality of life of any nation is measured by the economic growth of
that given nation. Economic growth is itself governed by three factors,
namely, growth in physical capital inputs into production, growth in labour
inputs into production, and improvements in technology. In the South
African context, statistics reveal that, in the period from the 1970s to
the 1980s, the average economic growth was heavily led by capital and
labour inputs, whilst in the 1990s the situation started to be reversed,
resulting in efficiency improvement in production due to technological
advancements.

The latter emphasises the importance of a well-defined national system of
innovation which is necessary to create an enabling environment for the
development of technological skills, as well as the allocation of these
skills and resources to research and development, coupled with the
facilitation of capital investment to exploit the output of such research
and development strategy. The foregoing observation seems to suggest,
therefore, that innovation, science, technology and human capital can all
play a significant role as enablers of sustainable long-term growth in our
national economy.

However, sustainable economic growth for our nation will not be realisable
in the current socioeconomic set-up and arrangement as dominated by racial
imbalances, both in human and physical capital. What then should be done?
The answer is concise: black empowerment.

At this juncture, it may be wise probably to re-examine the successes and
failures of the white empowerment programmes adopted since 1892 by the then
Cape colonial governments, including the apartheid regime in 1948. Such a
review reveals the following trends. Firstly, white empowerment programmes
demonstrate that when government focuses on long-term investment in
education, poverty relief and affirmative measures - that is procurement
and employment coupled with an enabling environment for economic growth - a
developmental state can support economic growth and at the same time reduce
levels of poverty and increase business ownership within a targeted
population group.

Secondly, it reveals that the promotion of white supremacy through white
empowerment was a disastrous initiative which led to the emergence of the
world's most unequal society, torn apart by mass civil strife and conflict,
regional wars and environmental degradation.

Thirdly, it also reveals in the context of a growing economy that white
empowerment ensured that whites were absorbed at levels higher than blacks
and the latter led to the emergence of a self-sustaining white labour
aristocracy based on superior knowledge and skills.

Fourthly, there were colonial government initiatives such as land
settlement, irrigation, public works, etc, aimed at improving the living
conditions of poor white families, grew the economy, while at the same time
relieving poverty.

Fifthly, industrial policy put in place by General Jan Smuts between 1918
and 1924, which focused on growth, research and development, state
enterprises, etc, helped to widen the gap between blacks and whites in
educational and economic opportunities, so that by the 1950s, the supply of
unskilled whites had already disappeared and been substituted by blacks. By
the 1980s, whites controlled most businesses and were the majority within
professions and the skilled labour market.

Arising from the above-mentioned experiences, our ANC-led Government has
therefore undertaken to initiate and support black empowerment on the basis
of the following principles: firstly, education and skills development in
the historically disadvantaged communities resulting from white empowerment
of many decades; poverty relief; affirmative preference; land and capital
ownership, and economic growth fostered by a developmental state.

Unlike the white empowerment programmes of the former illegitimate colonial
governments which were dedicated to entrenching white supremacy, our
legitimate Government promotes black empowerment, not as a goal, but as a
business strategy aimed at facilitating access to educational and economic
opportunities for the formerly disadvantaged communities.

Secondly, it is building a democratic society where individual ability,
talent and effort is rewarded with recognition and incentive. Thirdly, it
is eliminating poverty and creating a better life for all within a policy
framework for sustainable development. Therefore, under these strategies,
where black and white empowerment were aimed at serving different goals, we
think that this is a big challenge - to the Ministry of Science and
Technology, in particular, but the whole Government in general - to review
and speed up the changes in black empowerment, especially among women as
well as people with disabilities.

We have not done much since 1994, but something has been done, and it needs
to be acknowledged; but we think that in the near future more will be done
and at an accelerated pace.

Before I conclude my talk, I would just like to go back and address the
House about the Iraq question.

An HON MEMBER: The debate is about science and technology! [Interjections.]

Mr N E NGCOBO: The Iraq question is really based on science and technology.
It is based on science and technology with weapons of mass destruction at
the centre of the science and technology arena. [Interjections.] The world
should unite against the illegitimate invasion of one country by a
superpower whose sole reason is that it possesses weapons of mass
destruction to destroy anybody who challenges its invasion. Thank you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY: Chairperson, I would
like to acknowledge very significant members of the science and arts
communities in the public gallery: Ms Sylvia Mdunyelwa, an artist; Prof
Cynthia Marivate, the CEO of PanSalb; Mr Eddie Mbalo, CEO of National Film
and Video Foundation; Mr Rashid Lombard, the maestro here who gives us the
North Sea Jazz Festival every year ... [Applause] ... Dr Peter Lor, CEO of
our National Library; Prof B Serowe, acting CEO of Northern Flagship; a
delegation from the Flemish government's Ministry of culture who are
currently in South Africa to assist in the formulation of collaborative
projects that the Department of Arts and Culture is working on with the
Flanders government. You are most welcome and we appreciate your co-
operation. [Applause.]

Many issues have been raised by the hon members of the House. There were
very constructive observations, encouragement and, of course, invaluable
support that has been given to the two departments that we head. I'm very
deeply appreciative of the support that has been given and I believe that,
working together through the Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science
and Technology, we will refine our strategies and create new thrusts in the
future in terms of the priorities for this country, for our region and for
the continent.

Quite clearly, human resource development is at the heart of it. We cannot
produce a vibrant, innovation system in the country, both in terms of
science and technology, but also in terms of the arts, without a continuous
flow and growth of new researchers and new artists populating our
institutions.

We have seen a lot of progress, particularly in the number of African
students who are passing matric at the higher grade level in mathematics
and science. Quite clearly, a new culture is now taking shape abroad all
over the communities. Parents are getting more interested in the education
of their children. I know that a lot of parents who can afford to do so are
buying computers for their sons and daughters. Quite clearly, the message
is reaching somewhere.

Education is working very closely with us, as well as the private sector,
and a lot of foreign governments are very keen supporters and participants
in the drive to create a science and technology cadre in terms of teachers
in our schools. Programmes to upgrade teachers' qualifications are very
successful. So I must say that the prospects are good for this country, and
good also in terms of retaining our young scientists, our artists and our
computer experts.

As we implement the new research and development strategy, we will be
creating new career paths for our young people. It is quite meaningless to
train people at a PhD or Masters level and then expect the only avenue of
employment to be that of becoming a teacher. For too long in this country,
African graduates could only become teachers. People went to university,
did their BSc and found that many of the avenues were closed at the time,
and then the teaching profession became less and less attractive because
people felt the restriction.

Our biotechnology regional centres of excellence, which will be
multidisciplinary, are opening up a whole new avenue in terms of
pharmaceuticals, soil remediation, water purification and in terms of our
forestry and chemical industries and, of course, in terms of enhancing our
natural-resource-based industries. This, I think, is going to absorb a huge
number of people.

I was talking to Noc Frick, the CEO of the Council for Geoscience. He was
telling me about the problem of acidic water in our mines. And the only
solution is not a physical one, but a mechanical one, through
biotechnological remediation, using bacteria, etc. And here, just in that
area alone, huge possibilities for doctoral and post-doctoral students are
developing.

So the situation is bright. Let us not be despondent. We may not do
everything all at once. We may not achieve total eradication of poverty,
but by creating the basis for new industries and for new markets, we can
say that we are addressing the issue even now.

As far as culture is concerned, we are on a very strong drive around issues
of moral regeneration. We believe that for a society to be progressive,
successful and stable, the morality issues, the values and the normative
order of society and communities are absolutely critical. So we have
engaged on a new project in Arts and Culture, using choral music to drive
the Moral Regeneration Movement.

We are, of course, looking at visual arts as well. We have not emphasised
the visual arts properly. Sweden and many other countries in the Nordic
region make it a law that 1% of expenditure on any new building is
allocated to the arts. In other words, every new government building will
be a possibility for the exhibition of new artists and even established
ones. Therefore you create a market for the visual arts. And I'm going to
recommend strongly to our Minister of Public Works that all government
buildings become a venue for exhibiting our new artists and also propose
that all departments buy this art, just as the private sector has been
doing, in order to create a market and therefore to create jobs.

Our performing arts are doing well. For the first time, we are going to
have R42 million just for the performing arts companies. This is a very
significant ... [Applause] ... movement compared to what happened in the
past when money went to the four performing arts councils. The
administrators looked after their own interests, but very little went to
paying the artists themselves. So there has been a significant change.

With regard to community arts and the traditional dancers, traditional
singers, and composers, someone has made the remark that they are not being
developed properly compared to more advanced arts or modern arts. We want
to bring indigenous music and indigenous dances onto the same level that
Western ballet or Western opera is at, and that means ... [Applause] ...
promoting the teaching of these disciplines at technikons, in private
academies and at universities because these are an expression of the
indigenous character of our people, and can be a new product that we export
as a nation.

I know that the hon Anna van Wyk is very concerned about the heritage
sector. She has made this point very forcefully. We are going to take those
issues up because we cannot allow this to happen to valuable heritage,
which is limited, by the way. You know, built heritage, in comparison with
the rest of the developed world, is very limited in South Africa. These old
Dutch gables, the churches and the furniture in these buildings have got to
be protected and preserved at all costs, so we will be doing so.

I am happy that there is an understanding of the importance of
multilingualism in empowering the whole subregion of Southern Africa. I'm
happy with this remark because indeed it is going to be prominent in our
culture programme when we deal with SADC Ministers. So, thank you very much
for your support. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 12:58.
