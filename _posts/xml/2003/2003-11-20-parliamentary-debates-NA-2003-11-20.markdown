  CONGRATULATIONS TO SPEAKER ON WINNING NORTH-SOUTH PRIZE OF THE COUNCIL OF
                               EUROPE FOR 2003

                             (Draft Resolution)

           awarded the North-South Prize of the Council of Europe for 2003;
           and

             GOOD WISHES TO MUSLIMS AS RAMADAAN DRAWS TO AN END

                             (Draft Resolution)

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, I think I would also be failing in  my  duty

       for all Muslims.

Agreed to.

   RECOGNITION OF FIRST GROUP OF SCIENTISTS FROM PREVIOUSLY DISADVANTAGED
                                 COMMUNITIES

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Before I take  Members'  Statements,  hon  members,  I'd
like to ask you to acknowledge the presence amongst us of  the  first  group
of scientists to be recruited by the  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs
and  Tourism  from  previously  disadvantaged  communities.  [Applause.]  We
welcome all of you. We are sure your contributions will assist this  country
and this nation. We thank you.

 FIRST GROUP OF BLACK RESEARCHERS RECRUITED BY MARINE AND COASTAL MANAGEMENT

                            (Member's Statement)
Mrs R A NDZANGA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC is immensely proud to have  in
its midst today the first group of black researchers, male and female,  that
have been recruited by Marine and Coastal Management.

South Africa is truly a maritime nation. The research establishment has,  in
the past, been  dominated  by  historically  advantaged  scientists.  Today,
previously disadvantaged individuals constitute 40% of the staff  complement
of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

Now, to the young men and women that are visiting us, today we are proud  of
you. We congratulate you in the  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism, in particular on recruiting such young scientists in the age  group
of 25 to 34 years. Empowering young people puts  our  country  in  a  better
position to compete with the best in the world. We  have  acknowledged  that
these  young  people  carry  responsibilities  that  are  not  beyond  their
expertise. I congratulate you, and thank the senior scientists for  training
and mentoring this growing group of young marine scientists.

In conclusion, I am happy that our painful years of  the  struggle  are  now
yielding fruits and I am extremely proud to be associated with  this.  I  am
proud  of  this  progress  in  my  lifetime.  Thank  you,   Madam   Speaker.
[Applause.]

                 DEPUTY PRESIDENT ZUMA AND ARMS DEAL SCANDAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv H C SCHMIDT (DA): Madam  Speaker,  the  shocking  display  of  political
partisanship by the Joint Committee on  Ethics  and  Members'  Interests  in
clearing Deputy President Zuma at all costs deserves condemnation.

The fact  is,  though,  that  this  was  a  sideshow  just  like  the  Hefer
Commission is a sideshow. The real crux is the investigation into  the  arms
deal. Andrew Feinstein, a former ANC MP, says the ANC received  $35 million,
that Numsa received a huge amount of money  and  that  gifts  were  made  to
important persons near the top of the ANC.

It may be  that  the  Swedish  parliament  will  investigate  these  serious
allegations against BAE-Saab, who are alleged to have bribed  their  way  to
the granting of the contract for the Gripen aircraft.

It is not enough that the Swedish parliament should act. Why  is  the  South
African Parliament so silent? Why is the ANC silent? Why does the  President
say nothing, and why does the Deputy President hold his tongue? Until  these
issues are properly investigated, the arms deal scandal will not go away.  I
thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

                 ALLEGATIONS OF RACISM AGAINST CRICKET COACH

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M S M SIBIYA (IFP): Madam Speaker, former South African  cricket  captain
Kepler Wessels has been suspended  as  a  coach  for  the  Eastern  Province
following allegations of racism.  His  suspension  comes  after  the  United
Cricket Board of SA gave instructions for Wessels to be  suspended  on  full
pay pending the outcome  of  the  disciplinary  hearing.  These  allegations
follow those of an alleged racist assault on a black pupil at  a  school  in
Cape Town. We sincerely hope that the investigations into both  these  cases
reveal the truth.

We are fast approaching 10 years of democracy in  South  Africa,  and  there
are still allegations, claims and incidents  of  racism.  Many  people  have
fought and given their lives to free South Africa and to rid  it  of  racism
and racist elements. We cannot allow racism to rear its ugly  head.  It  has
to be stamped out if we want to progress as  a  free  and  fair  country.  I
thank you, Madam Speaker.

        MESSAGE OF SYMPATHY TO PEOPLE AFFECTED BY VRYBURG HAILSTORMS

                            (Member's Statement)

Rev A D GOOSEN (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC shares the grief of  the  Taung
and Vryburg communities who  this  past  weekend  were  hit  by  devastating
hailstorms and gusting winds. As a result of  this  hailstorm  four  people,
among whom was a three-year-old girl, lost their lives, while  flash  floods
and winds led to extensive damage to infrastructure and property and  killed
livestock.

The ANC commends the speedy action of the North West  government  which  has
immediately made available R1 million to assist those who have  lost  family
members and property.

The ANC further commends the police, traffic officials,  emergency  services
and disaster management officials on manning a  joint  operation  centre  to
monitor and prevent further losses to affected communities.

The ANC conveys its deepest sympathy to the families and  friends  of  those
who lost their lives during this hailstorm. I thank you. [Applause.]

                   THE NEW NP AS MOST REPRESENTATIVE PARTY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP):  Madam  Speaker,  allow  me  a  few  remarks  in
connection with the latest opinion poll  conducted  by  the  Human  Sciences
Research Council. Anyone who still thinks that the DA will become  the  next
government must also believe that the story of Little  Red  Riding  Hood  is
true.[Laughter.] With only 10,5% of  the  vote,  the  DA  has  a  snowball's
chance in hell of becoming the next government,  so  stop  promising  people
the moon. It is not going to happen.

Maar die DA se aanspraak om die Wes-Kaap te  verower,  lé  ook  aan  skerwe,
want die peiling toon aan dat  die  Nuwe  NP  met  40%  van  die  steun  die
sterkste party in die Wes-Kaap is. [Tussenwerpsels.] Doemprofete  skryf  die
Nuwe NP gereeld af, maar met 8,7% van die steun is die  Nuwe  NP,  naas  die
ANC, die snelgroeiendste party in  Suid-Afrika.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)
[But the DA's claim to  win  the  Western  Cape  has  also  been  shattered,
because the poll shows that the New NP, with 40%  of  the  support,  is  the
strongest party in the  Western  Cape.  [Interjections.]  Prophets  of  doom
write the New NP off regularly, but with 8,7% of the  support,  the  New  NP
is, after to the ANC, the fastest growing party in South Africa.]

But most of important of all, according to the survey, is that  the  New  NP
is the most representative party in the country. So if any member  wants  to
belong to a party which truly reflects the  rainbow  nation,  feel  free  to
join the New NP. [Interjections.]

En ten slotte wil ek net aan die DA sê:  In  die  verkiesing  volgende  jaar
gaan ons julle opfoeter tot by oom Daantjie  in  die  kalwerhok.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion, I would just like to say to the DA: We  are  going  to  beat
you from here to eternity in the election next year. [Applause.]]
                              THE RIGHT TO VOTE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE (ACDP): Madam Speaker, the ACDP has welcomed the  proposed
amendment to the Electoral Act to  allow  persons  temporarily  overseas  on
holiday,  for  business  trips,  studying  at   tertiary   institutions   or
participating in a sports event, to vote in next year's elections. The  ACDP
has been at the forefront of the campaign  to  allow  overseas  citizens  to
vote. We were the first party to raise the issue in the Portfolio  Committee
on Home Affairs and have elicited petitions from South African  citizens  in
various countries supporting their right  to  vote,  especially  in  the  UK
where the ACDP has an active support base.  At  all  stages  we  took  legal
advice regarding the constitutionality of the amending Bill.

The ACDP welcomed  the  initial  amendment  to  the  Act,  allowing  certain
categories of South Africans temporarily overseas to vote, and shared  their
disappointment when there was a dramatic  about-turn  in  the  home  affairs
committee rejecting this  amendment.  We  are  therefore  pleased  that  the
President decided to allow an amendment to  the  Bill,  permitting  holiday-
makers, business travellers and students to vote.

We nevertheless maintain that it is the  right  of  all  South  Africans  to
vote, regardless of their geographic position at the time of  the  election.
South Africans are operating in a global environment and there is no  reason
why South Africans working for South African  companies  overseas  or  those
temporarily overseas on a two-year  working  permit  should  be  denied  the
opportunity to vote. Whilst we  believe  that  all  South  African  citizens
overseas  should  be  given  the  chance  to  vote,  we  believe  that   the
Government's stance to ensure that these categories of voters can vote is  a
step in the right direction.

                    SOUTH AFRICAN SCHOOLS' WASH CAMPAIGN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D S MAIMANE (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  to  inform  the  House  that
partnerships between Government and the people of South Africa  are  leading
to a healthy, productive  nation.  On  Thursday,  16  October  2003  at  the
Morekolodi Primary School in Mmakau,  near  Ga-Rankuwa,  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry, led by Minister Kasrils and  Unilever  SA's  CEO
Doug Baillie, launched the schools' initiative for the  South  African  WASH
Campaign. We promote the simple act of washing hands with soap  as  a  means
of saving lives.

It  is  known  that  most  endemic  diarrhoeal  diseases  are   not   simply
waterborne,  but   transmitted   because   of   poor   hygienic   practices.
International  research  presented  at  the  World  Summit  on   Sustainable
Development indicated that as many as  one  million  lives  could  be  saved
worldwide by washing hands with water and soap. Proper washing of the  hands
reduces the risk of diarrhoeal diseases by up to 47%.

The private sector's involvement with the Department of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry  in  the  South  African  schools'  programme   offers   an   ideal
opportunity to make a difference to the communities  in  which  the  company
operates. The joint partnership between DWAF and Unilever will see the  WASH
Campaign rolled out in schools around the country, in conjunction  with  the
Vaseline children's television series and radio  inserts  on  the  country's
vernacular stations.

The Department of Health and the Department of Education are  also  involved
through their integration with the WASH Campaign. I thank you. [Applause.]

                         INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G T MADIKIZA (UDM): Madam Speaker, the UDM  has  consistently  championed
the  need  for  infrastructure  development  to  form  a  central  part   of
socioeconomic growth in South Africa.  Infrastructure  development  improves
social  conditions  for  everybody,  especially  the  poor.  It  also  makes
business easier and cheaper to conduct. Many new  jobs  and  small  business
opportunities  could  be  created  during  the  large-scale   infrastructure
development programmes.

This is a responsible way for the Government to actively contribute  to  job
creation. It seems that the Government has realised that this  is  a  policy
option that makes sense or that it makes sense to promise such a policy.  We
were  sceptical  when  infrastructure  development  was  announced  at   the
beginning of the year under the auspices  of  Transnet.  It  now  transpires
that Transnet is  being  strangled  by  a  R33  billion  debt  burden  which
effectively  cancels  any  possibility  of  wiping  out  the  infrastructure
backlog, never mind embarking on a new one.

Similarly, local government has been announced as a driver of  public  works
programmes that will supposedly create a million jobs. This is  despite  the
well-known debt burden and financial  trouble  of  most  municipalities.  It
remains to be seen if these promises will materialise. I thank you.

                 CALL FOR PROMOTION OF INTERNSHIP PROGRAMMES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M F CASSIM (PJC): Madam Speaker, the hon Minister of Education  recently,
on two occasions, informed the House of a glut in BCom  graduates  from  our
different universities.  At  the  same  time,  the  Global  Entrepreneurship
Monitor, publishing the results of a survey undertaken by the University  of
Cape Town Graduate School, found that men in South Africa below the  age  of
45 were lacking in confidence to become entrepreneurs.

Clearly, in view of the above situation,  something  needs  to  be  done  to
support internship programmes that would  allow  all  unemployed  graduates,
male and female, to acquire technical and  practical  experience  to  become
new entrepreneurs in line with the goals and vision of Nepad.

Let us also remember that the  burgeoning  opportunities  in  the  field  of
tourism, hospitality, generation of renewable and clean  power,  information
technology with particular focus on the use of open source  code  which  the
Government has now adopted, and transport, need to be matched by  the  entry
of qualified young people to take up the challenge.

I  therefore  call  on  the  Government  to  investigate  financial,   other
legislative  and  practical   support   for   internship   programmes   with
established businesses and industries in South Africa and elsewhere  in  the
world. If such programmes  exist,  let  us  explore  the  expansion  of  the
programmes. [Time expired.]

               LINE FISH PERMITS IN CAPE AGULHAS MUNICIPALITY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J D ARENDSE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the fishing villages  of  Arniston  and
Struisbaai, located in the Cape Agulhas Municipality, are  governed  by  the
DA. Many of the historically disadvantaged people in these communities  have
been unsuccessful in their application for line fish permits.  This  was  of
great concern to the ANC  leaders  in  the  area,  who  then  met  with  the
community to address this matter. As a result  of  the  ANC's  intervention,
additional  permits  have  now  been  awarded  to  these  communities.   The
community and the ANC are very pleased with the outcome.

However, the fact is that Arniston  and  Struisbaai  are  located  in  a  DA
municipality, but at no point did the  DA-controlled  council  even  discuss
this matter. Despite this, the leader of the opposition, Mr Tony  Leon,  saw
fit to pose on the  boat  of  one  of  the  applicants,  Mr  Van  den  Berg.
Unbeknownst to Mr Leon, Mr Van  den  Berg  was  once  in  fact  one  of  the
unsuccessful applicants. He had handed his line fish application to  one  of
Mr Leon's NCOP members, Antoinette  Versfeld,  who  in  turn  did  not  even
bother to submit this  application  to  the  department.  Mr  Van  den  Berg
eventually came to the ANC, who intervened and ensured that he  was  granted
a pernmit.

Perhaps if Mr  Leon  wants  to  score  political  points  by  attempting  to
piggyback off the ANC's hard work on the ground, he should check  his  facts
first and ensure that his own members are doing their work. [Applause.]

                    ROLL-OUT OF ANTIRETROVIRAL PROGRAMME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M WATERS (DA): Madam Speaker,  Cabinet's  approval  of  the  Government's
antiretroviral  programme  is  long  overdue.  We  welcome  it  despite  the
shameful delays. While the ANC hesitated,  over  1  million  South  Africans
died of HIV/Aids and 500 000 children were orphaned. This tragedy cannot  be
undone.

Yesterday's statement that the fall in the price of drugs over the last  two
years has made the roll-out possible is misleading. The truth  is  that  the
ANC has always had the power to reduce these drug prices just as Brazil  did
some five years ago by licensing generic drugs. The  announced  roll-out  is
just a promise at this point. The ANC will be judged on its actions.
It is vital that the Government announce specific target dates and list  the
clinics which will be part of the roll-out  programme.  Only  then  can  the
people judge whether the Government is able to deliver on this promise.

                       PRESIDENT'S CUP GOLF TOURNAMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): Madam Speaker, this week the top golf players of  the
world have descended on South Africa to participate in the  President's  Cup
Tournament, which starts today and runs until Sunday.

The tournament is the best thing that has ever happened in  the  history  of
golf in South Africa. It is also a very significant tournament in the  sense
that we have two top golf players, rated number one and number  two  in  the
world, who happen to be black and  who  are  an  inspiration  to  our  young
people out there in the townships and rural areas who aspire to being  great
players of golf in the future.
Seeing players like Woods and Singh in this tournament is an inspiration  to
us in this country, as it shows that there  is  a  lot  of  potential  among
people of colour to do well and even excel in this kind of sport, which  has
long been viewed as a white elite sport.

This tournament will also showcase our country to the world in that  we  are
now changing steadily but surely in as far as the integration of  all  races
is concerned as more people of colour are showing interest  in  this  sport.
We hope that this tournament will have an impact  on  the  young  people  of
this country to show more interest in golf and speed up programmes that  are
designed to attract people, especially those from  previously  disadvantaged
communities, to play golf. We wish all the participants in  this  tournament
all the best.

                 WORLD SCIENCE DAY FOR PEACE AND DEVELOPMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S L DITHEBE (ANC): Madam Speaker, 10 November marked  World  Science  Day
for Peace and Development. In the words of the Director-General  of  Unesco,
Koichiro Matsuura, the greatest challenge of our time is to create  a  world
where all citizens live in dignity and peace  in  a  hospitable  environment
that they have learned to care for.

He goes on to warn about growing unease  and  mounting  concern  in  certain
quarters about the adverse consequences  of  science,  its  daring  exploits
notwithstanding. He calls on scientists to  welcome  these  developments  in
the context of proper functioning democratic processes, and they  must  work
hard in educating policy-makers,  opinion-shapers  and  the  general  public
about science, its purposes, its principles, its methods, its  critical  and
questioning spirit and its accomplishments.

The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, so far, manages  33
signed international agreements, and invests R13 million  per  year  in  177
research  and  development  projects  in  order  to  facilitate  interaction
between  South  African   scientists   and   scientists   in   international
partnership institutions.

Our role in the promotion of science in Nepad is further  testimony  to  our
1999 manifesto predicated, among other things, on the resolve to  achieve  a
better Africa and a better world. The ANC  Government,  too,  believes  that
without global science there can  be  no  sustainable  development,  without
sustainable development there can be no global peace. To this end,  we  look
forward to marking National Science Week in our country in May next  year  -
an exciting moment for our youth and an opportunity to explore a  career  in
science. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                         PROTEST MARCH AGAINST CRIME

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C B JOHNSON (New NP): Madam Speaker,  on  Monday  a  meeting  took  place
between the Minister of Safety and Security,  the  hon  Charles  Nqakula,  a
delegation from the New NP and Mrs Lind Vins Jennings of  the  Arrive  Alive
campaign. As members of this House may know, Mrs  Vins  Jennings's  son  was
killed in a hijacking in  Edenvale  earlier  this  year.  The  Arrive  Alive
campaign, which is being led by Mrs Vins Jennings,  is  planning  a  protest
march against crime on 30 November.

At the meeting the New NP and the Minister pledged  their  support  for  the
campaign and said that we would endorse any initiative taken by  any  sector
of the population to mobilise people against crime in  South  Africa.  Crime
affects all South Africans,  it  cuts  across  all  communities  and  across
political party differences. Therefore we hereby  call  on  each  and  every
political party in this House to join in the march, to  show  their  support
and to unite as a nation against crime.

We call, in particular, on the DA, and we say:  "Let's  set  politics  aside
for this one day. Let's rise above  party-political  differences,  show  our
support as a nation and,  as  concerned  South  Africans,  let's  all  march
together." I thank you. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I'm having some difficulty.  There
were two statements that were directly involved in  education.  I  ask  your
permission to respond on a cluster  membership  basis  in  relation  to  the
Government's roll-out programme on HIV/Aids.

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister,  we  are  quite  strict;  there  are  no  cluster
responses. You may certainly speak on your two proposals.

   "WASH YOUR HANDS MESSAGE" TO SCHOOLCHILDREN; AND MEETING THE SOCIAL AND
                      INTELLECTUAL NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY

                            (Minister's response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Well, the DA  lacks  grace  and  they  should  be
reminded of the extraordinary roll-out programme.

In relation to the Mmakau  school,  the  hon  member  is  quite  right  that
Minister Kasrils inaugurated  this  programme  with  Unilever  -  the  "WASH
partnership" - which shows, again,  that  the  Government  is  committed  to
creating innovative ways of doing things. The creativeness is here first  of
all in the partnership with Unilever. The roll-out  programme  there  is  to
bring  the  fundamental  message  of  "Wash   your   hands"   to   all   the
schoolchildren. This  is  a  very  important  element  in  the  Government's
programme.

The second part is that it raises consciousness  among  children  about  the
relationship between disease, health and washing. And, since  this  plays  a
very integral part in the programme for Grades R to 9 - that  is  the  life-
skills programme - it is important that even  those  communities  that  have
water are able, in fact, to learn the message. Regarding the third part,  in
the particular situation of Mmakau  -  Minister  Kasrils  was  there  -  the
community has organised itself. So when there's  no  water  in  the  school,
there are dry pit latrines.

Again, this shows the resilience  and  the  extraordinary  capacity  of  our
people to take fate in their  hands  and  not  to  rely  on  the  provincial
government and the national Government. So, on behalf  of  Minister  Kasrils
and on behalf of the Department of Education, I'm bringing to the  attention
of the House  that  this  programme  with  the  private  and  state  sectors
together shows how we in South Africa can innovate and create.

The second question is Mr Cassim's question. Yes, there are  three  elements
in response. First of all, I have emphasised the fact that we are  producing
graduates and people with diplomas for whom there is  not  sufficient  work.
On the one hand, I look at the DA's document  on  liberation  and  education
and see that we must strengthen autonomy of institutions.

At the same time, as every government in the world  is  doing,  universities
will have to learn that courses provided for the purpose of  subsidies  from
the Government are not an adequate response to  the  social  needs  and  the
intellectual needs of our country. That  is  the  first  part.  We  have  to
grapple with the idea - not tattered 19th century  notions  -  that  in  the
21st century there must be a reaction from all social institutions  to  meet
the training needs of our country.

The second point, Mr Cassim - and as a well-informed person you should  know
- is that we have internship programmes. We have internship programmes.  Now
you say that we should create internship programmes, and that  if  they  are
there we must expand them. Well, that's like having your cake and eating  it
too. We have internship programmes and, in fact, government departments  are
now obliged to 5% of their recruitment being through internships. So we  are
on the way. We don't have to invent them; we're on the way.

With regard to the learnerships, they fall under the  Department  of  Labour
and we work together on learnerships. The  Further  Education  and  Training
colleges will be making a particularly important contribution to  using  the
learnership for on-the-job training. The important thing is  that  it's  not
so much that there are no jobs, because the jobs are there as the  President
has said again and again, but that what we need are  trained  personnel  for
them. Therefore, I agree with you very much that the whole  approach  to  be
taken is to bring in the skills.

Over the weekend the international council,  or  the  ICT,  and  development
people met in Cape Town, and only this Government can bring the  leading  15
people of the computer industry from all over the  world  to  South  Africa.
They emphasise the relevance of ICT and training. No one  should  leave  any
educational institution without being proficient in computers. That  is  the
beginning of the whole process of  training.  Thank  you  very  much,  Madam
Speaker.

The SPEAKER: Hon Minister, you are going to  have  your  cake  and  eat  it,
because I am advised by the staff that the Rules do make provision  for  you
to respond from the same cluster.

                      ANTIRETROVIRAL ROLL-OUT PROGRAMME

                            (Minister's response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you, Madam Speaker. There  are  some  small
victories for ordinary members of this Assembly in relation to the  Speaker.
[Laughter.] Thank you very much, Secretariat.

I think we must recognise that we have spent since the programme  of  action
on HIV was adopted ... All the evidence shows that a systematic  process  of
training personnel is vital, because you see that is  the  problem.  If  you
are not in Government, you can rely on slogans. We can't  rely  on  slogans.
You have to train people ... [Interjections.] Listen young pup, you have  to
train people.

Secondly, you must make sure that institutional arrangements  are  there  on
the ground. Thirdly, if there is a break in the treatment,  different  forms
of immunities may arise which the Minister of Health will  educate  you  on.
We have worked very closely with the foundation in the  United  States,  the
Bill Clinton Foundation, for the past two months to ensure that we  start  a
roll-out programme in the 56 districts  which  are  at  an  advanced  stage.
We'll build up the other districts that are not at  an  advanced  stage.  In
this way we can assure, in a systematic way, that those who  are  undergoing
treatment carry on with the treatment. Now, as  an  example,  we  know  that
those who have  asthma  don't  use  their  inhaler  and  that  their  asthma
deteriorates. Here, it's life-threatening if you don't  carry  on  with  the
programme.

So I've said that you lot lack grace. It is  something  you  have  to  learn
with greater maturity, but everyone, including the  TAC,  has  welcomed  the
Government's proposals. The Department of  Health  has  been  instructed  to
implement them. [Interjections.] One day, not in my  lifetime,  the  DA  may
learn that the  Government's  job  is  to  ensure  adequate  protection  for
everyone, and that there is free consent, by the way, because no-one can  be
compelled to have treatment for HIV. [Interjections.] This free  consent  is
vital. The baying wolves outside  the  caravan  -  as  Smuts  said  -  won't
understand a thing. The caravan will move on and leave you very far  behind.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]
The SPEAKER: Order! Order, hon members!

    SIXTEEN DAYS OF ACTIVISM: SOUTH AFRICA TO UNITE IN FIGHTING VIOLENCE
                         AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN

                          (Subject for discussion)

The SPEAKER: Order! Before calling the first speaker, I just  want  to  make
one comment. The item on the Order Paper is "South Africa to unite ...  "  I
am very sorry to see that the men, with only two  exceptions,  have  decided
that only women will speak on this subject. I think you need to ponder  what
that title means, and parties who  put  up  such  lists  need  to  seriously
consider this. I'm not saying which parties. It'll be obvious  to  everybody
here what is going to happen.

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Madam Speaker, let me start off by paying tribute to  all
the victims of violence and abuse, most of whom are women  and  children  in
South Africa. I also want to commend our  singers,  South  African  singers,
who came up with a song for this campaign of 2003 that calls on  all  of  us
to stop the violence and abuse of women  and  children.  I  trust  that  all
artists and  all  sectors  of  our  society  will  also  contribute  to  and
participate in this campaign.

The Sixteen Days of No Violence Against  Women  and  Children  Campaign  was
initiated by the UN and it has been adopted as an annual  programme  by  the
South African Government since 1998. Before  I  dwell  on  the  campaign,  I
would like us to turn our attention to  the  report  that  has  been  tabled
today by the Joint Monitoring Committee on the Status of Women,  the  Unifem
report `` Women, War and Peace''.

It is important that the House takes note of the report, and  of  Resolution
1325 which addresses the safety and security needs of women in  wartime  and
in peacetime.

On 16 May 2003 the hon  Netumbo  Nandi-Ndaitwah,  the  Minister  of  Women's
Affairs and Child Welfare  in  Namibia,  together  with  the  hon  Dr  Frene
Ginwala, the Speaker of  the  South  African  National  Assembly,  and  Miss
Noeleen Heyzer, the  Executive  Director  of  Unifem,  launched  the  report
entitled ``Women, War and Peace'', which was written by Elizabeth  Rehn  and
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf here at  our  Parliament.  The  choice  of  venue  and
partners involved was inspired by the activism of African women in the  run-
up to the successful passing of Resolution 1325 by the UN  Security  Council
in October 2000, under the chairship of Namibia.

Some of the women involved in this campaign include the hon  Thandi  Modise,
who is the Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Defence and  the  Joint
Standing Committee on Defence, as well as Ms Alison Lazarus  of  the  Centre
for Conflict Resolution at UCT, to mention just a few.

The Unifem report was closely followed by a feedback  session  on  a  report
entitled "Human Security Now" by the UN Commission  on  Human  Security,  on
which the Speaker, Dr Ginwala, served as  a  commissioner.  The  report-back
session to civil society groupings in Africa was held  from  26  to  27  May
2003 in Pretoria, and was hosted by  the  Speaker  and  other  commissioners
under  the  auspices  of  the  Africa  Institute.  Let   me,   once   again,
congratulate the Speaker on representing our  Parliament,  as  well  as  the
women of South Africa, in this regard. [Applause.]

I would like to urge hon members to read this report. It is  quite  a  thick
document, but I think it is very important. It raises crucial  concerns  for
women not only in our country, but throughout the continent. I  would  like,
therefore, to read to the members the resolutions  that  have  been  adopted
out of this report, which I think are very relevant to the  subject  of  the
day.

The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status
of Women, having considered the report of the  independent  experts  on  the
Women, War and Peace report, endorses the recommendations contained in  that
report, in particular, the following: firstly, the Secretary-General of  the
UN should give priority to achieving gender parity in  his  appointments  of
special representatives  and  envoys;  secondly,  that  gender  equality  be
recognised in all peace processes, agreements and  transnational  government
structures; thirdly, that a UN trust  fund  for  peacekeeping  by  women  be
established; fourthly, that Unifem and the department of  political  affairs
ensure that gender issues and women's full  participation  are  incorporated
in peace-building and postconflict  reconstruction;  and  five,  that  peace
negotiations and agreements have  a  gender  perspective  through  the  full
integration of women's concerns and participation in peace processes.

I have said before that there have been concerns around  the  fact  that  in
Burundi and the DRC, for instance, women have not been fully represented  at
the  peace  table.  Therefore  these  resolutions  need  to  be  implemented
immediately by us, our governments and also by NGOs.

The UN and donors should invest in women's organisations as a  strategy  for
conflict prevention, conflict resolution  and  peace-building.  They  should
also exercise flexibility in responding to urgent needs  and  time-sensitive
opportunities, and foster partnerships and networks  between  international,
regional and local peace initiatives.

With regard to national electoral laws, I hope we are going to look  at  our
own electoral law quite urgently. There should  be  international  electoral
assistance to establish quotas in order to  achieve  gender  parity,  ensure
voter registration and education, increase the ratio of women  in  electoral
commissions and  observer  missions,  and  to  provide  training  for  women
candidates. A  lead  organisation  should  be  designated  with  the  United
Nations for women's education and  training  in  conflict  and  postconflict
situations. This lead organisation, together  with  Unesco,  the  UNHCR  and
Unicef should ensure that all education  programmes  for  displaced  persons
provide for women as well as girls. The  International  Labour  Organisation
should expand vocational and  skills  training  for  women  in  postconflict
situations, including in the nontraditional, public and private  sectors  in
a manner that is sustainable  and  responsive  to  the  local  and  national
economy.

It was also recommended that we have a TRC for Africa, in  which  women  who
have gone through wars can come and share  their  experiences,  as  was  the
case during the TRC process that  we  had  in  South  Africa.  We  are  also
calling on our Government to have a TRC for women,  because  we  found  that
during the TRC process women were only  there  to  share  experiences  as  a
result of the suffering, the imprisonment and  killing  of  their  husbands,
sons and brothers, not to share their own pain.

Further, we recommend that domestic violence be a  criterion  against  which
countries will be reviewed in the African Peer Review Mechanism process.

We also proposed that a council for African women mediators be  established,
comprising women who are  not  in  active,  formal  politics,  who  will  be
available, who may be utilised as special envoys  and  who,  as  a  council,
will have a special status with the peace and security council.

We also urge our governments to accelerate or speed up  the  setting  up  of
the peace and security council of the African Union and to  make  sure  that
it engenders that there be equal numbers of men and women. I will  therefore
urge our members to go through this important report and also to  make  sure
that we take it to our constituencies and to our provinces.

Coming back to our campaign, I would like to say  that  our  Government  has
gone a long way towards addressing the question of  violence  and  abuse  of
women and children. We all know about the legislation that has been  passed,
namely the Domestic Violence Act, the Maintenance Act of  1998,  etc.  Right
now we have in Parliament the Portfolio Committee  on  Justice  deliberating
on the Sexual Offences Bill, which is an urgent  Bill  that  we  would  like
this House to pass as soon as possible.

I just want to raise an objection on behalf of women in this  House  and,  I
also know, of women in NGOs and outside, to the proposal  that  the  age  of
consent to sex be lowered to age 12. We all object to this  because  we  are
facing high rates of child  trafficking,  high  rates  of  abuse,  rape  and
violence against our children. [Applause.]

The joint monitoring committee also supports the Compulsory HIV  Testing  of
Alleged Sexual Offenders Bill, which will ensure that a victim  of  rape  is
given a report of the test of the offender  and  ensure  that  she  has  the
right to demand that the offender be tested. We also support all  the  other
Bills that are before the House. We want to urge the Department  of  Justice
to fast-track these Bills and make sure that we  pass  them.  We  have  been
waiting for them for a very long time and we believe that they  will  assist
in ensuring that we have effective sentences for abusers.

We also want to commend the  Department  of  Safety  and  Security  for  the
sterling work that the police are doing and also for the training  that  has
been given to police officers. We can  see  that  transformation  is  taking
place.

We want to commend the Department of Justice, but we are  also  saying  that
more needs to be done in terms of training our magistrates, our  judges  and
our prosecutors on  domestic  violence  issues  and  on  how  to  deal  with
victims, as well as how to deal with gender issues. We demand that  all  the
criminal justice officials undergo the necessary training.

The campaign will be organised in all provinces. It will be launched by  the
Government, the National Gender Machinery and the Department of  Justice  in
Kimberley on 25 November 2003, and will be opened by the  Deputy  President.
All our departments have a particular niche in the campaign  that  they  are
addressing and we have activities in all provinces. We urge all  members  to
participate in their constituencies and in their provinces.

Let me also say that there will be a "Good Men's March" on 25 November  here
in Cape Town, and we urge all the good men from this  House  to  participate
in that march in the city. We will also have  a  closing  ceremony  here  in
Parliament on 10 December and the President will participate. We  hope  that
all political  parties  and  leaders  will  participate.  Thank  you,  Madam
Speaker. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Madam Speaker, the DA strongly  supports  the  call  for  all
South Africans to unite in fighting violence  against  women  and  children.
Perhaps the most horrific form of violence is that of rape. It  is  used  to
break and humiliate women, men, families and communities.

In  a  study  entitled  "Combating  Sexual  Violence   in   the   South   of
Johannesburg", Andersson and Mhatre point out that 20% of teenage girls  and
13% of boys living in the southern parts of  Johannesburg  have  experienced
sexual abuse by the time they turn  18  years  of  age.  They  believe  that
constant exposure to sexual violence has forced these  teenagers  to  choose
between  humiliation  and  survival.  The  teenagers   see   themselves   as
survivors, but this comes at a cost: the  development  of  a  culture  of  a
sexual violence.

This is not unique to South Africa, but Andersson and Mhatre  maintain  that
one of the legacies of the apartheid era is that Soweto, and what they  call
"the deep south" informal townships of Johannesburg, have  become  known  as
the rape capital of the world. They go further and say:


  The endemic violence characterised  in  these  areas  has  become  highly
  sexualised and turns against community members with bitter effect.  White
  and black, male and female, children and adults are the victims of sexual
  violence as frustrations and feelings of inadequacy are  vented  in  what
  has been called "a sexualised culture of violence".

Violence is not only committed by men, but what is alarming is that  out  of
the 3 000 men interviewed in streets and  shops,  one  in  three  said  they
could be violent towards women.  Even  worse  was  the  opinion  of  teenage
girls: 10% said that they did not  have  the  right  to  be  protected  from
sexual violence, while 27% said forcing sex with someone you  know  did  not
count as sexual violence.

In a presentation to the JMC on the Improvement of the Quality of  Life  and
Status of Women, Lisa Vetton, gender co-ordinator  of  the  Centre  for  the
Study of Violence and Reconciliation tells of a woman of 65 who  was  raped.
She is now HIV-positive. She was not getting any drugs at the  time  of  the
interview. When she was raped,  her  doors  were  broken  and  her  bed  was
broken. She sleeps on the floor now, and she is very frightened because  she
cannot lock the door. The man has not been arrested, and she  has  lived  in
fear for two years that he will come back. She cannot work  because  she  is
ill and cannot travel to her local welfare office to get her  pension.  This
has had an effect on her HIV status because she cannot afford to  buy  fresh
fruit and vegetables in order to eat properly.

Rape victims often do not go to the police, they are not using  health  care
services and they are not going to court. They keep quiet out of  shame  and
fear of stigmatisation, or because they  do  not  know  about  the  services
available to them. If we want to  encourage  women  to  break  the  silence,
Government will have to put  an  enormous  amount  of  money  into  fighting
violence against women, because if women cannot get to  these  services,  or
when they get there the services are overloaded,  we  are  just  victimising
women further.

A social worker, working in an organisation dealing  with  violence  against
women, went to court three days in a row. She gave up  because  she  got  so
tired of going back each day and being told: "We cannot help you today,  you
must come back tomorrow." She had already taken three days' leave to  get  a
protection order. This gives you a sense of how  women  are  being  excluded
from assistance, and how much effort will have  to  be  spent  in  order  to
offer women the services they need so much.

All of us must take hands to support this initiative, not just  for  the  16
days of activism, but every day,  until  this  terrible  cycle  of  violence
comes to an end. [Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, hon members, the IFP wishes to  express  its
full support for this debate and campaign. I want to begin  by  paraphrasing
from Gandhi, who said that women  are  greater  at  self-sacrificing,  women
have a greater power of  endurance,  they  have  greater  courage  and  have
greater moral power. How apt are these words, yet they ring hollow for  many
thousands of women who have not recognised their immense power. It is  these
women who are helpless and have to face the abhorrent abuse of power.

How many times have we read  of  incidents  and  acts  of  violence  against
women? How many times have we asked questions like: "Why doesn't she  leave?
Why does she let this continue?" The answers are  always  the  same:  "I  am
dependent on him." or "Who will look after my children?"

South African women are not safe in their homes, in their  places  of  work,
on the streets and even in their own cars. We as MPs  need  to  condemn  the
pervasive nature of this type of violence which allows women to  live  in  a
kind of entrapment. There can be no legal, social,  economic  or  any  other
justification for what continues to occur in many homes.

Trying to find research and actual stastistics on violence against women  is
a mammoth task.  More  often  than  not,  statistics  are  discrepant,  with
dockets missing  and  thousands  of  unreported  cases.  According  to  CSIR
research on violence against women, it has been estimated that  between  one
out of four and one out of every six women in South Africa  are  in  abusive
relationships, and that one woman is killed by her partner every six days.

Research also shows that an average of 80% of rural  women  are  victims  of
domestic  violence.  Domestic  violence  and  violence  against  women   and
children are not private matters. This is  not  terror  kept  behind  closed
doors. It takes place in a pattern and an area of  confusion  and  intimacy;
mixed with hope, fear, isolation and  intimidation.  It  affects  women  and
children and those around them.

The children of violent families often end up as criminals  themselves.  The
human impact of this type of violence cannot be quantified.  The  effect  on
children is most profound.  Statistics  show  that  90%  of  children  in  a
domestic violence situation are in the same room or in the next room  during
the attacks or assaults. A third of  these  children  try  to  intervene  to
protect their mothers.  Here,  again,  one  cannot  quantify  the  emotional
trauma.

We need to look  beyond  the  picket  fence,  beyond  the  front  door,  and
remember that for many women the home is not a safe  place.  Their  partners
are not safe. Women who seek redress often face abuse from  police  officers
who are indifferent or hostile, medical examiners who  are  ill-trained  and
inaccessible and prosecutors who are  inexperienced  and  at  times  biased.
There are judges who doubt women's credibility as survivors  and  who  often
hand out lenient sentences.

This has to change. We need to get tough and tougher and say:

"No more lenient sentences;  no  more  slaps  on  the  wrist."  As  MPs  and
legislators we need to ensure that the safety and security of  our  children
and women is paramount and that it is a priority. If  domestic  violence  is
one wave in the broader sea of violence and is allowed to continue  to  take
its toll  on  this  nation,  then  all  of  us  indirectly  sentence  future
generations of South Africans to fear, misery, isolation and shame.

But legislation will not change the  imbalance  of  power  between  men  and
women. Much more work is needed to educate men on the destructive impact  of
violence. This is a long-term challenge. Changing attitudes  is  key.  Males
in this House need to take the lead. It is men who beat their wives, and  it
is men who teach boys about women. Attitudes are  formed  at  a  very  young
age. There must be a strategy to foster behaviour to ensure that  women  are
treated with dignity and respect.

It is critical that men stand at the forefront of this  campaign,  like  the
many males who stood outside the steps of Parliament today. We also need  to
get rid of taboos that tend to immobilise women and make them  stagnant  and
helpless, while men are left free and enterprising in the outside world.

The IFP denounces the widespread violence and calls for stronger  protection
for women and tougher sentences for the perpetrators. I also want  to  state
at this juncture that many of my male colleagues tell  me  that  it  is  not
just women who are being abused, it is also males who are  being  abused.  I
do concede, yes, hon males, there are males who are being abused.  But,  yet
again, there has to be this change of  attitude.  I  cannot  emphasise  this
enough. The stereotypical attitudes and expections have to change.

In closing, I pay tribute to all those  women's  organisations  and  to  the
many men who work  tirelessly  to  campaign  and  lobby  on  behalf  of  the
voiceless.  South  Africans  cannot  continue  to  close  the  shutters   on
violence. Let's come together and put aside party-political persuasions  and
party ideologies. Let's come together in solidarity and say no to  violence.
Let's come together as men and women of this House to honour the  female  of
the species.

I have also been reassured that next time there is a debate on gender,  most
of the males in my party are going to be at the  forefront  of  the  debate.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr S L DITHEBE: Madam Speaker, the way to begin, is to  begin.  So,  let  me
begin  by  taking  a  moment  in  my  speech  and  expressing  my  heartfelt
condolences to the hon Zunaid Kotwal and his wife  Ruwaidah  on  the  tragic
loss of their son,  Mohammed,  in  a  drowning  accident  in  Pelican  Park,
recently. The lesson we draw from this incident is that all  children  must,
at all times, live in a safe and secure environment.

Having said that, I would like to focus on the topic of  the  day.  Clearly,
this topic is an  injunction  to  all  South  Africans  to  unite  in  their
multitudes, singlemindedly, in the fight against violence against women  and
children. Cognisant of and conscious of this mammoth task, the ANC  believes
that it is not the shouts and plaudits of  the  throng  during  this  period
that will bring an end to the shameful scourge  of  violence  against  women
and children, but rather single and collective steps that all of us take  to
eradicate violence against women and children.

We know it will take a radical change  in  the  attitudes  of  many  in  our
society who still prey on the weak and vulnerable women  and  children,  and
for purposes of my speech, children in particular.  Since  1994,  our  dream
has been to bring about a better life for all, including the  children,  and
to date, we have invoked  several  measures  through  projects,  programmes,
policy and legislation to protect our children against all  forms  of  abuse
and neglect. Our synthesis  report  towards  a  10-year  review  speaks  for
itself.

In June, last year, this Parliament received a  detailed  and  comprehensive
report from the task group on the  sexual  abuse  of  children,  which  made
numerous laudable and lucid recommendations. It  is,  therefore,  heartening
to note that some of the draft Bills recommended for speedy passage in  this
House, such as the Child Justice Bill, Children's Bill and the  soon  to  be
amended Sexual Offences Act, are being fast-tracked in  order  to  create  a
comprehensive child protection regime.

Parliament has also ratified some new UN conventions and optional  protocols
that are concomitant by-products of the UN Convention on the Rights  of  the
Child. The list of recommendations contained in the June report referred  to
earlier is elaborate and goal-driven, and required the  relevant  committees
to report to the National Assembly within 12 months after  the  adoption  of
this report. Have we done that?

Even if it means revising the time schedules, the urgency and importance  of
the   report-back   process   is   critically   important   or   cannot   be
overemphasised. Accordingly, we welcome the 2004 MTEF that provides for  the
cost of extending the child support grant to children in the age cohorts  of
11, 12 and 13, and ultimately 14, in the next MTEF period.

We also welcome a provision that has  been  made  during  the  current  MTEF
period to implement the Children's Bill and the Child  Justice  Bill,  aimed
at establishing child  justice  centres  whose  function  it  is  to  divert
children away from prisons and towards more  rehabilitative  programmes,  as
well as the roll-out of sexual offences courts, the  appointment  of  family
advocates and councillors, and dedicated  maintenance  officers  whose  role
will be to improve the quality of services  to  vulnerable  groups  and  our
children in particular.

We also welcome the provision for the significant growth  in  the  base-line
budgets, among  others,  in  the  Integrated  Nutrition  Programme  and  the
transfer of the integrated nutrition grant to the  Department  of  Education
from the 1 April 2004.

To the Minister of Education, Minister Asmal, I  would  like  to  make  this
call that he take steps to ensure uniform quality nutrition  standards  once
this grant has been transferred to his department because, in the  past,  we
have seen many inconsistencies in terms of the nutrition standards  required
for this particular programme in schools.

In addition, a ban on corporal  punishment  must  be  strictly  enforced  in
schools and children must be taught their rights  and  responsibilities,  in
terms of our law, the UN Convention on the  Rights  of  the  Child  and  the
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child.

I want to reflect briefly on the results of a study conducted in America  in
1998. The results were published  in  The  American  Journal  of  Preventive
Medicine. The results of the study were startling,  if  not  shocking.  They
established that children exposed to abuse are more prone to obesity,  heart
disease, cancer, depression and other chronic health problems as adults.

One of the ways of  mitigating  this  disaster  is  for  families  to  allow
paediatricians to do  regular  genital  checks  on  children,  to  determine
whether they have been abused. Abuse takes many forms. It can  be  a  mother
or father who physically or emotionally abuses their child or even  sexually
abuses them. One thing is clear: There can be no excuse  for  the  abuse  of
children.
The Masai of Africa's greeting goes thus: How are the children?  The  16-day
campaign must be an everyday campaign in which we do not only seek  to  know
how the children are, but rather what we can do to save the children.

In conclusion, I dedicate this poem by a certain Cindi  to  those  who  have
suffered abuse. It's titled The real me.


  I've been stuck what seems like forever in the dreary arena of my abusive
  life. I've drowned my sorrows, hurt, fear, pain and shame, felt  so  much
  anger and rage. I questioned: Why? What did I do?


  In therapy for years, trying to learn why these things  happened  to  me,
  but it's impossible to totally understand. I finally know  through  hard-
  fought battles, the whys are no longer important. My self-blame is fading
  away. I have worth. I have value. I deserve good,  not  bad.  I  was  the
  innocent victim. He was an extremely sadistic man.


  In my own mind, I'm a survivor, I'm strong. I will  live  on  to  be  the
  owner  and  keeper  of  my  own  mind  and  body.  In  me   is   courage,
  determination, a will to live and feel again. I deserve  to  survive,  to
  love, to feel free, to bring out the happiness residing within reach just
  inside the real me.

[Applause.]

Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Madam Deputy Speaker,  terrible  violence  in  many  forms
against women and children is a fearful everyday reality. I  would  like  to
challenge the male members of Parliament to accept joint responsibility  for
gender matters. Males have a gender too. Mention the word ``gender'' to  the
average person and watch his eyes glaze over.

There is a variety of politically correct instruments - with little to  show
for the time, effort and cost invested in them but until the males  in  this
Government decide to take active ownership,  the  situation  on  the  ground
will not improve.
Die Nuwe NP  wil  graag  voorstel  dat  mans  ten  minste  50%  van  al  die
geslagsgerigte instrumente moet uitmaak. Daar  is  dikwels  werkswinkels  en
opleiding vir vroue, maar feitlik niks vir mans nie. Deur  die  samestelling
van hierdie liggame te verander, ontvang mans daarmee onmiddellik reeds  die
amptelike erkenning wat hulle meer  sekerheid  kan  bied.  (Translations  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[The New NP would like to propose that males should comprise  at  least  50%
of all gender-centred instruments. There are often  workshops  and  training
for women, but almost nothing for men. By changing the composition of  these
bodies, males would immediately receive the official recognition that  would
offer them greater certainty.]

The transformation of South African society brings great insecurity on  many
fronts. Modern young men are confident in their role in the home,  workplace
and society. Those that have not transformed  find  it  harder  to  come  to
terms with the new realities. This insecurity is now manifesting  itself  in
a backlash against women, the vulnerable and the defenceless.

Hierdie Parlement, sowel as die leiers  daar  buite  moet  help  om  hierdie
situasie  om  te  draai.  Lewensvaardighede  moet  meer  gespesialiseerd  in
opvoeding- en opleidingsinstansies aangebied word.  Ouers  word  nie  gebore
nie   en   mans   is   ook   ouers    -    hulle    moet    opgelei    word.
Ouervaardigheidsopleiding  moet  'n  verpligte  deel  van  leerplanne  word.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This Parliament, as well as the leaders out there must  assist  in  turning
this  situation  around.  Life  skills  need  to  be  presented  in  a  more
specialised fashion in education and training institutions. Parents are  not
born and men are parents too - they need  to  be  trained.  Parental  skills
training should become a compulsory part of syllabi.]

The same applies  to  conflict  resolution,  negotiating  skills  and  anger
management.

Elke kind en student moet hierdie opleiding doeltreffend ontvang  en  geleer
word om dit  te  beoefen.  [Each  child  and  student  should  undergo  this
training effectively and should be taught practice it.]

There are obviously some deeper issues  underlying  our  societal  problems.
The first is the moral decay in South Africa. The leaders of a  country  set
the tone. Here and there one finds commendable initiatives and they need  to
be  encouraged.  The  Moral  Regeneration  Launch  that  so  many  in   this
Government and Parliament attended has so far shown little life.

Die leiers hier en in die sakesektor moet hand in eie boesem steek  en  huis
skoonmaak. Die hebsug en  materialisme  in  die  staat  en  sakesektor  neem
onrusbare  afmetings  aan.  Opvoeding  en  algemene  ordentlikheid  wat  ten
grondslag van 'n suksesvolle samelewing lê, is aan die kwyn.  Die  vereistes
van inbors, betroubaarheid, pligsbesef en bedagsaamheid  is  nie  net  goeie
maniere nie; dit is dinge waarsonder 'n administrasie  en  'n  regering  nie
behoorlik  funksioneer  nie.  Dienste  kan  nie  gelewer  word  nie  en  die
kwesbares kan nie beskerm word nie. Kinders en vroue voel dit die  eerste  -
in  Suid-Afrika  tans  die  ergste.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[The leaders here and in the business sector must search  their  own  hearts
and get their houses in order. The greed and materialism in  the  state  and
the business sectors  are  taking  on  alarming  proportions.  Training  and
decency, that form the foundation  of  a  successful  society,  are  on  the
decline. The requirements of  integrity,  reliability,  sense  of  duty  and
consideration are not only good manners, they are things  without  which  an
administration and a government cannot function  properly.  Services  cannot
be rendered and the vulnerable cannot be protected. Children and women  feel
it first - currently the worst in South Africa.]

Economic growth, education and  training,  job  creation  and  an  efficient
criminal justice system all obviously need to be improved and expedited.
But, very important and lastly, the  New  NP  would  like  to  propose  most
specifically that Government set up a task team to investigate  the  effects
on South African society of the popularisation of violence by the media  and
entertainment industry, and that it advise the Government and Parliament  on
what needs to  be  done  in  this  respect.  I  thank  you,  Madam  Speaker.
[Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  16-day  activism  campaign
against the abuse of women and children is commendable. However, we must  be
aware that the 16 days of activism is only a part of the process  to  combat
the abuse of women and children.

This  year's  campaign  focuses   on   participation   between   businesses,
parastatals, NGOs and CBOs and includes the active participation of men  and
boys. Once all sectors of society realise  the  value  and  significance  of
women and children, the  protection  of  their  Constitutional  rights  will
enjoy greater relevance.

However, we must identify some of the core causes  that  contribute  to  the
abuse of women  and  children.  One  such  focal  area  points  to  the  sex
industry. Here, I  find  it  contradictory  that  the  ANC  women  group  is
actually going to object  to  the  lowering  of  the  age  of  consent  with
reference to the Sexual Offences Bill, whereas we are saying to  them:  "Use
your power in this House." If you are saying that you - women - make up  52%
of the population, then we can vote against  this  clause  or  against  this
Bill. So, please don't stand up here and  try  to  make  political  speeches
when you know you can use your power.

Recent research has shown that exposure  to  pornography  causes  damage  to
women and children in a variety  of  ways.  Linked  to  pornography  is  the
brutality of prostitution. This House  will  have  to  acknowledge  that  it
played into  the  hands  of  those  who  promote  and  thrive  off  negative
economics by adopting legislation  that  permits  the  abuse  of  women  and
children through prostitution, sex trafficking and gambling. The ACDP  calls
for a review of all of these laws, with immediate effect. I thank you.

Ms N C NKABINDE: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members,  only  last  week  we
debated in this House the report detailing the critical problems facing  the
proper implementation of the Maintenance Act and the Domestic Violence Act.

Parliament had recognised that a problem existed and sought to  address  it.
As a result, these two Acts came about as the central pillars of our  effort
to fight violence against women and children. As the violence  continues  we
can only conclude that the legislation is lacking, or that it is  not  being
implemented properly.

I would submit that it is more the latter than  the  former.  Implementation
is insufficient because the attitudes of many people  remain  stuck  in  the
rut that views women and children as inferior  servants,  little  more  than
domestic animals of burden that can only perform a limited number of  tasks.
This is why most of the violence and abuse against  women  and  children  is
perpetrated by a person that they know or by a person they are related to.

I am not saying that every man in South Africa is a violent  beast,  neither
am I claiming that there are no women or children who commit  horrific  acts
of violence. In fact, we should salute the  many  men  who  not  only  avoid
violence, but who are also actively opposing  it,  for  example  the  annual
Men's March that is scheduled to take place soon.

What we cannot avoid is the fact that the majority of  the  perpetrators  of
violence against women and children are men. Perhaps an even more  difficult
fact to face is that these  men  are  somebody's  son,  brother,  uncle  and
father. They live amongst us and, as long as the  myths  of  the  patriarchy
are perpetuated, they will continue to abuse, molest and  murder  women  and
children. Myths and fallacies, an example being that a husband  is  entitled
to discipline his wife physically, still pervade many communities.

A shocking example  of  this  recently  transpired  in  which  a  provincial
government official beat and kicked his wife in broad daylight in  front  of
a court building whilst other people were looking on;  or  the  high-ranking
diplomat who keeps his job in the face of more than  20  charges  of  sexual
harassment. This is because some people still believe that a male  authority
figure is somehow entitled to do despicable things to  those  over  whom  he
has authority.

The law is explicit  on  this  point:  third  parties  can  report  domestic
violence. In fact, witnessing a crime and not  reporting  it  is  a  serious
offence.  Complacency  is  our  biggest  enemy.  As  much   as   we   expect
prosecutors, magistrates ... [Time expired.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Hon Deputy  Speaker,  South  Africa  must  indeed  unite  and
muster every resource in fighting the abhorrent crime  of  violence  against
women and children.

Activism is a proven method for  engendering  a  climate  in  society  where
violence against women and children is denounced for what  it  is:  a  crime
and, in respect of a man, an abnegation of that man's  masculinity  and  the
emasculation of his humanity. The levels of tolerance for  violence  in  our
society can only be reduced through sustained activism,  education  and  co-
operation by all.

Violence was in-built in the previous political order,  where  thuggery  was
the modus operandi for conduct of politics and social  activities.  The  new
political  order,  with  a  focus  on  human  rights  and  the   rights   of
individuals, is well placed to see a tidal wave of change in attitudes.

The progress towards a gentler and more humane  society,  however,  requires
that we do more to tackle the abuse  of  drugs  and  alcohol.  The  activism
which will soon begin should therefore not forget to  target,  in  the  most
concentrated form, the abuse of drugs and alcohol.

I give my full and unstinted support for the  16  days  of  activism.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mrs M L NGWENYA: Madam Deputy Speaker, today we are  spreading  the  message
of 16 days of activism for no violence  against  women  and  children.  This
campaign assists  our  Government  to  generate  increased  awareness  about
violence directed at women and children, how  it  manifests  itself  in  our
society, and the  negative  impact  it  has  on  the  development  of  these
vulnerable groups.

[Today we debate about the oppression and abuse of our living ancestors -  I
am talking about our grandmothers, some of whom are always beaten  by  their
grandchildren, as they want their pension money. They are not  given  enough
food, they are not given water to wash, and they are made to sleep with low-
quality blankets; and when they  have  passed  away,  they  are  bought  new
blankets, with the thought that they need not get cold where they are  going
to - the afterlife.
Yes, there are those grandmothers who are well cared for. We  meet  them  at
the pension payout points, at churches, and in their homes as we visit  them
from house to house. This is where we find  the  good  work  done  by  their
children and their  grandchildren.  You  would  find  them  well  seated  at
tables, while some are sitting on mats under the  trees,  eating  nutritious
foods. When you get to the family next door, you will be hurt when you  find
difficulties encountered by a grandmother  who  gets  R700  monthly  but  is
afraid to ask for food when she is hungry, because she is  afraid  of  being
beaten.

When you go to pension payout points, you will find moneylenders  collecting
monies borrowed by grandmothers in the middle  of  the  month,  having  been
forced to do so by their grandchildren,  who  are  bent  on  misusing  their
monies. On the other hand, you find burial  societies,  who  say  they  bury
each other. They take fingerprints of grandmothers  so  that  they  will  be
able to get their money by stop order. We try to talk  to  them,  indicating
to them that what they are doing is theft, but we fail as we do not  have  a
Bill that can prevent that.
Honourable Zola Skweyiya, Minister of  Social  Development,  talked  to  the
aged in East London on 1 October and said that the community  should  ensure
that the aged get the respect they deserve and play  a  big  role  in  their
lives by safeguarding and implementing the various cultures and our  way  of
life.

Old people, be patient because the Minister and his department will come  up
with a Bill to prevent any person, even if it is your child, from  doing  as
they please with your lives.]

After everything I have said, let's quote our hon Minister of Health,  Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, who said at the International Day of Older Persons on  1
October 2003:


  There is now a realisation in the world that older persons are  an  asset
  and a resource that contributes to the development of our society.

She said further that as the number of people aged 60 or more increases,  we
begin to see a shift in the pattern  of  chronic  illnesses  such  as  heart
disease, hypertension, cancer and depression. That is why  it  is  important
for our children and grandchildren to take good  care  of  the  old  persons
because the longer they live, the better the chances for survival  of  their
families financially. This is because in poor  communities  the  same  older
people make valuable contributions to  households  as  carers  of  children,
people with disabilities, and those affected and infected by HIV/Aids.

Lastly, hon Minister Skweyiya made a strong call and said,  ``We  call  upon
older  persons  to  take  the  lead  in  our  country's  moral  regeneration
campaign''. He also had a message  for  young  people  who  ill-treat  their
elders, saying:

``Hlompha mmago le tatago gore matšatši a gago a tle  a  atišwe  lefaseng!''
["Respect your mother and father so that your days can be added on  earth."]


He said Government aimed to improve the payment of  social  grants  so  that
the elderly did not have to stand in long queues and travel long  distances.
A social grant is our constitutional right and must be  paid  in  conditions
of dignity and respect. I thank you, Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Deputy Speaker, the PAC appreciates the  awakening  of
this nation and expresses shock at the violence against women  and  children
as evidenced by the Sixteen Days of Activism campaign.  The  PAC  has  noted
with deep concern the endemic violence  perpetrated  on  the  women  in  our
country. Crimes such as rape and murder  against  women  and  children  have
reached alarming proportions. They are listed  as  some  of  the  SA  Police
Service's nine policing priorities.

The question the PAC is  posing  regarding  the  Sixteen  Days  of  Activism
concerning violence against women and children is: Where is the  budget  for
the fight against this violence?

As early as 1999, the National Police Commissioner indicated that  he  would
ask for extra funds for police to implement the Domestic  Violence  Act.  If
the alarming figures of violence against women are to be  reduced,  the  PAC
believes that  there  must  be  a  percentage  levy  imposed  on  each  SAPS
programme and allocated to the development and implementation of  a  women's
safety plan.

An explicit budget must be sustained and used to roll  out  a  comprehensive
women's safety plan. This will contribute to a  faster  response  time  from
the police and effective implementation of the Act. It will  improve  police
skills in investigating and  documenting  domestic  violence,  in  order  to
decrease the number of cases rejected by the courts owing to  inadequate  or
incorrect information.

The explicit budget should focus  on  rural  areas  and  improve  access  to
police stations  where  women  can  lay  charges.  An  explicit  budget  for
domestic violence is critical. To reject this proposal  is  to  continue  to
victimise women  and  children  physically,  emotionally  and  economically.
Having  said  all  this,  it  is  important  to  state  that  the   nation's
development is judged by how its menfolk treat women and children.
It is an indictment on our country  that,  10  years  after  the  demise  of
apartheid colonialism, violence against women and  children  has  escalated.
Of course, one of the causes of violence against women is  their  dependency
on men. There must be a massive and rapid programme of education for  women.
They must be armed with skills which will  liberate  them  economically,  so
that they are not dependent on men economically. Thank you.

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  May  I,   firstly,
compliment the men taking part in this debate, especially the hon Pheko  who
never fails to take this podium whenever issues of women  and  children  are
addressed and  discussed.  I  also  thank  hon  Nefolovhodwe  of  Azapo  for
honouring me by giving me two minutes of his time, giving me four minutes.

The  MF  strongly  supports  the  Sixteen  Days  of  Activism  campaign  for
nonviolence against women as part  of  an  international  effort  to  create
greater awareness of the abhorrent violence against women that  is  rife  in
so many societies. We are proud of this effort embarked upon as a result  of
the department's determination to stop violence against women and children.

The negative effects and statistics of such violence are too  horrifying  to
go into, but reality is that greater awareness will  assist  immensely.  The
campaign strategy  for  this  year,  reaching  a  variety  of  role-players,
Government, NGOs and the private and public sectors and from  the  urban  to
rural areas, promises to leave no stone unturned. The MF is pleased by  this
determination, and joins wholeheartedly in this  campaign  to  end  violence
against women and children.

We have to reach out to our constituencies and  our  communities  and  stamp
out all violence against women  and  children.  The  MF  also  supports  the
campaign involving white ribbons. Violence against women and children  is  a
contravention of their human rights that are stipulated by law in  the  Bill
of Rights in our national Constitution. A contravention of these  rights  is
a crime in terms of the law. While the  criminal  is  to  be  punished,  our
women and children need to be  protected.  We  need  to  ensure  that  their
rights are upheld.

At this stage may I take this  opportunity  and  convey  this  very  special
message that comes from the leader of the MF, Mr A Rajbansi. He  sends  this
message, conveying his fullest support for this  very  important  debate  on
violence against women  and  children.  Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.
[Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Sixteen Days  of  Activism  campaign,
which opposes violence against women and children, is an opportunity for  us
as members of Parliament to reflect upon whether  we  have  done  enough  to
help combat the scourge sweeping our country.

Yes, we can all say that Government is doing something,  but  is  Government
doing enough? Are we, as the people's representatives, doing enough?  Do  we
ourselves know the conditions in which the police and court  officials  have
to work, and do we understand what the problems are in our criminal  justice
system? Or do we prefer to turn away and say that the  campaign  of  Sixteen
Days of Activism is the best the Government can do?

Are we placing enough pressure  on  Government  to  allocate  the  necessary
resources? Consider the following points:  One,  every  single  police  unit
established to investigate child and  women  abuse  cases  is  understaffed.
Two, the average number of cases each investigating officer has at one  time
is 62 when it should be 18. Three, only half of these  officers  working  at
child protection units have received training in child abuse. Four,  only  a
handful of officers receive any counselling or psychological support.  Five,
police officers do not have  the  basics,  like  their  own  telephones,  to
conduct an investigation. Six, 87% of all police officers  working  at  CPUs
have not had a psychometric test in order  to  determine  their  suitability
for working at child protection units. Seven,  child  protection  units  are
used as a  dumping  ground  for  police  officers  who  are  under  internal
investigation - in one case an officer raped one of the very people  he  was
supposed to protect. Eight, the lack of staff and of vehicles means that  in
some areas the child victim and the perpetrator ride to court  in  the  same
car. Nine, rape victims have to wait in  hospital  queues  for  up  to  five
hours before being examined by a doctor. Ten, some state doctors  refuse  to
examine children who have been raped. Eleven, there  is  a  shortage  of  at
least 1400 social workers whose role is  crucial  in  providing  support  to
victims, children and women - thank you hon member September.  Twelve,  that
at least 412 scientist  posts  are  vacant  at  the  two  DNA  laboratories,
causing excessive delays in court cases. Thirteen, 60%  of  sexual  offences
courts do not have basic security measures, such  as  metal  detectors,  and
that 75% do not have x-ray  machines.  Fourteen,  the  Minister  of  Justice
stated in a reply to a parliamentary  question  that  the  minimum  security
measures I have just mentioned would only be implemented in  his  courts  in
the year 2007. Fifteen, some prosecutors  and  magistrates  working  in  the
sexual offences courts do not have basic facilities such as an  office.  And
lastly, that according to the Minister of Justice, who admitted  in  another
parliamentary  reply,  24  sexual  offences  courts   fail   to   meet   the
department's blueprint and in order for them to do  so  it  would  cost  the
taxpayer  a  mere  R30 million,  yet  these   courts   remain   nonblueprint
compliant.

I have mentioned 16 examples of where this ANC-led  Government  can  make  a
difference. If the ANC-led  Government  started  to  address  one  of  these
issues every day during the Sixteen Days of Activitism campaign  then,  yes,
I would say that they were making a  difference.  Otherwise,  these  Sixteen
Days of Activism will become yet  another  expensive  ANC  public  relations
exercise.

What we need from the President and the Government is not for them  to  keep
signing pledges, stating that they are against child  and  women  abuse.  We
all know the President and his Cabinet are against  this  disgusting  crime.
We are all against it. What we need from our President is for him to sign  a
contract with the people, which will commit him and the  ANC-led  Government
to specific targets with deadlines,  and  where  the  people  can  hold  him
accountable. We need to improve the pathetic 6% conviction  rate  for  child
rape. Only 1 300 out of 22 000 child rapes per year end up in  a  successful
conviction.

Aids is another disease that affects women and children in a  profound  way.
The DA welcomes what seems to be another U-turn for  the  ANC  in  rejecting
the denialist theories and embracing mainstream thinking by  announcing  the
roll-out of antiretrovirals yesterday.

Hundreds of thousands of South  Africans  are  asking  themselves  why  they
should vote in  next  year's  election.  What  is  the  point?  I  say  that
registering and voting against child and women abuse is the best  reason  to
do so. [Interjections.]

It is high time that ordinary South Africans took charge to show  this  ANC-
led Government that we need more than fancy speeches, monotonous debates  in
Parliament, and unimplementable laws owing to the lack of  allocated  funds,
such as the Domestic Violence Act. We need action on the ground.

I say it is time to show the ANC that it is  time  for  change.  Instead  of
spending R60 billion on arms,  rather  spend  it  on  the  war  being  waged
against our women and children. [Interjections.] An amount of  R400  million
for one arms deal helicopter could have  been  spent  on  making  sure  that
court cases don't  drag  on  for  years,  as  is  currently  experienced  by
children.

Instead of spending R600 million on a luxury plane for the President,  spend
it on equipping our police officers and prosecutors  with  basic  equipment,
not luxury equipment. We need 365 days of activisim, not 16.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Deputy Speaker, I must say that this  is  an  interesting
debate but it's bony and reflects the history of  the  country.  This  is  a
very crucial debate in that we, as South Africans, have to  reflect  on  how
we move forward rather than yapping and haggling over the negatives.

As the ANC, when we took the decision to initiate this debate,  we  took  it
on the basis that we were serious about how  to  transform  society  and  to
better the lives of our people. Within that context, our history has  proven
us correct. The men and women  who  are  seated  in  this  House  have  made
tremendous contributions towards this particular debate.

When Comrade Thandi Modise got arrested I  was  still  young.  She  was  not
arrested because there was something different that she was doing.  She  was
making  her  contribution  within  the  organisation  and   within   society
regarding how to help with the transformation of  this  particular  society.
So, whatever you raise regarding what the present Government is  doing,  you
need to do that within the context that the women we  have  within  the  ANC
are women that have made tremendous contributions.

They have never been backbenchers or sat on the fence in terms  of  the  way
things happen. They contribute by  participating  within  the  organisation,
and by being at the forefront of the battles. So, to  us,  our  contribution
is not one of coming here, as Helen Zille did - her own history -  of  going
to Kenya and saying to people that the main  thing  about  the  majority  of
women in the ANC, as they sit  here,  is  that  they  are  not  using  their
majority vote to push for change.

Our women have done it totally  differently.  They  have  contributed;  they
have made us gender-sensitive in the organisation; and they have  genderised
even the democracy that we are busy participating in. So, they  have  played
a very significant role. It is in that context  that  whatever  you  say  as
Government, or as the opposition, you'd always  want  to  reflect  on  that,
rather than running parallel to what society is expecting you to do.

Now, regarding complainers, we do  have  complainers  in  society  who  call
themselves the opposition of the ANC. I usually continually warn  them  that
I don't think this is the platform for them to win votes.  You  have  to  go
out and make sure that you win votes outside. Here, you need to be  able  to
explain to us what you expect us to do to be  able  to  meet  the  needs  of
society.
As Waters walked away from the  podium,  I  kept  on  asking  myself:  ``Hon
Waters, what do you expect us to do?'' We have  been  raising  these  issues
together and you have been saying these things, but what is crucial  for  us
is what the DA has learnt from the process of going from court to court  and
going from police station to police  station.  What  is  your  contribution?
What do you do as the opposition? Do you come here to just sit and  complain
or do you continually say, ``in partnership  with  the  Government  this  is
what we are supposed to be doing"? This is very important.  [Interjections.]


I appreciate what you are saying because, to us, the issue of the  abuse  of
children and women has been quite central in our agenda. We need to be  able
to overcome it, and we need to be able to make sure that it doesn't  happen.
That's why when we met today, the ANC asked itself: What type of men are  we
talking about? What type of human beings are we talking about that are  able
to help these women to genderise society? What contribution is  expected  of
men, the men that the hon Waters and  others  have  been  complaining  about
that are not able to implement the laws that give them power? Are those  the
type of men that  we  are  talking  about  in  this  society?  Is  that  the
expectation of Government? Is that the expectation of our different  parties
regarding those men that are not doing what Government is doing? What do  we
say about them?

The ANC has been quite clear that we need to change ourselves.  We  need  to
be very emphatic about the type of men we are and that we do recognise  that
society is transforming. As society is transforming,  our  contribution  has
to be totally different. We should be the first ones who say,  ``Beside  the
emancipation of women, what else can we do?'' As you  go  to  the  different
marches that are being arranged in the country, what  else  is  expected  of
men?

As cross-cultural activities impact on ourselves,  when  you  practise  your
religion or whatever you do in society, you need  to  be  able  to  consider
that as a man, what is going  to  be  my  contribution  to  the  progressive
programmes that have been outlined by women in  front  of  me,  and  to  the
progressive programmes that the ANC has been able to outline so that,  as  a
man, you see yourself totally different from what you  used  to  be  because
you have to make a contribution? That is a contribution that is unashamed.

You have to revisit your own soul and think about yourself and say, ``Is  it
correct what I'm doing?'' Because, with due respect to all  the  good  words
you say, if you don't give recognition to the fact that without the  respect
that we have to go through ourselves, respecting the  different  women  that
we are talking about will not happen. It's in our interest that, as men,  we
should be able to help in transforming our society.

Now, what have we been able to do since the  introduction  of  the  Domestic
Violence Act in 1998 and all those things that have  been  introduced?  What
have we been able to do as men to assist with changes  within  our  society,
because that is a challenge that we are confronted with? What  are  we  able
to do? How do we continue to assist our women with the power  they  have  to
be able to make sure that, regarding the issues that we  talk  about  within
Parliament, they are able to implement those issues?

At this particular moment, what Government is looking forward to is  finding
a lot of activists who are gender-sensitive, who could  co-operate  and  who
could work together with our women in the gender units to  ensure  that  our
contribution doesn't just end in articulating statements, but that  we  come
down and get involved  in  the  various  issues  that  are  confronting  our
society.

The society that we are talking about is the society that has  gone  through
tremendous hardships,  and  it  doesn't  mean  that  those  individuals  are
outside of South Africa. It's those issues that are confronting me and  you.
We need to be able to help. This is  what  we  are  called  on  to  do,  hon
Waters. That contribution is expected from me and you regarding what we  are
doing. Are we helping each other? Are we helping to fight  the  conservatism
within our society? Are we applying our minds, because at the heart  of  the
problem of domestic violence is a  conservative  man  who  just  continually
thinks that he has to abuse his wife?

That  is  very  difficult  to  police  but  that   responsibility   is   the
responsibility that every man in this House has to take care of  because  it
is within yourself to be able to assist society to transform,  and  I  don't
hear that from your side. That is the issue  that  we  are  supposed  to  be
looking into rather than continuously wanting to refocus  and  change  focus
and start blaming Government. You are supposed to do those things.  You  are
supposed to contribute so that when society looks upon you and  expects  you
to have done something positive tomorrow, they are able to say that,  within
the justice system, this is what this man has been able to do.

You talk as if you don't  have  DA  members  that  work  within  the  Police
Service. You talk as if there are no DA members  that  are  working  in  the
justice system. Now, the question that we pose to ourselves is: What do  you
say to those men? Do you have policies that are  ready  to  transform  those
men so that they are able to contribute to society? You don't have them  and
that's why you spend most of your time attacking the ANC. Your  attitude  is
not able to move things forward. That's why you think and contextualise  the
contribution of our women in that way in the DA. You always look  at  issues
from a narrow perspective. You don't understand that they have done quite  a
lot of work. They have contributed to the type  of  Bills  that  we've  been
able to pass.

When we dealt with the Firearms Control Act, we were the first ones  to  say
that domestic violence has to be at the top of  our  agenda.  Now,  I  don't
hear you saying that you have been able to achieve that within  your  party.
You've stayed away from issues; you've stayed away form reflecting what  the
needs of society are. It's not about  the  ANC.  The  ANC  will  continually
defeat you in the elections but sometimes we say,  ``reflect  on  society''.
These debates of this nature are not debates where you  come  and  look  for
votes but they are debates that reflect how serious you  take  society;  how
serious you take dealing with child abuse; and how serious you take  dealing
with abuse and domestic violence. Because, if you have the answers  to  that
I would really appreciate listening to them.  But,  definitely,  I've  never
heard that you have been able to achieve that. [Interjections.]

The ANC has been very positive and has made a good contribution. That's  why
we are able to debate today. [Interjections.] That's  why  we  are  able  to
talk about issues that are confronting women. The point  is  that  you  have
been absent for the rest of your life. You have not understood  the  issues.
[Interjections.] You are not reflecting our  policy.  What  I'm  saying  is:
talk amongst yourselves. Talk to the men amongst yourselves.  Talk  to  them
and don't shout at me. Talk to them and ask them the same question  you  are
asking me, ``What are they doing about society?'' What  are  they  doing  to
help change the society? [Applause.] What are they doing to fight  the  rape
scourge? What have they ever done? What have they  presented  so  as  to  be
able   to   fight   domestic   violence?   They've   not   done    anything.
[Interjections.]  You  come  and  shout  and  shout.  We  are   seated   and
transforming the Police Service. We are seated and transforming the  justice
system to enable itself  to  confront  the  decision  that  we  have  taken.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon members, stop shouting at each  other,
please. Can the hon member just continue to address the House.

Mr M S BOOI: Madam Speaker, I know that it's always difficult  when  members
can't understand.  It's  our  responsibility,  as  the  ANC,  to  make  them
understand where we are going. So, what I'm saying is that, as the  ANC,  we
continuously say that you call on everybody  as  you  go  on  these  marches
during this campaign. It is not just the  sixteen-day  campaign.  There  are
quite a lot of issues. There are quite a  lot  of  things  that  we've  been
doing to highlight the plight of abused women and children. That  commitment
we have shown.

I've just addressed many prisoners at Pollsmoor and I talked to  them  about
what the expectation of society is and how society is looking at  them.  I'm
not seated here and shouting at members. I'm doing my work and  I'm  picking
up the responsibility of saying, ``How do we, as individuals and men  within
the ANC, readdress ourselves and relook at ourselves  so  that  whatever  we
say and whatever we talk about - which is called moral  regeneration  -  our
contribution becomes quite significant? It assists in changing society  from
what it is. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SAFETY AND SECURITY ON
    PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AGAINST TERRORIST AND RELATED
                               ACTIVITIES BILL

There was no debate.

The Deputy Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  moved:  That  the  report  be
adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.
    PROTECTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY AGAINST TERRORIST AND RELATED
                               ACTIVITIES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER  OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  no
country is exempt from terrorists' threats and attacks. Elsewhere in  Africa
such acts have been committed with devastating  effects,  notably  in  Kenya
and Tanzania. Here at home, despite the advent of democracy, we  experienced
firstly the bomb explosions intended to derail democracy  during  1993-1994.
The urban terror campaign in the Western Cape included pipe bombings, drive-
by  shootings,  hand  grenade  attacks  targeted   at   restaurants,   court
buildings, magistrates, a  prosecutor  and  police  investigators,  and  the
Boeremag activities culminating in the ongoing trial in Pretoria.

As explained in the  discussion  paper  of  the  South  African  Law  Reform
Commission, published in July 2000, some 200  criminal  explosions  occurred
between  13  April  1994  and  24  December  1999.  In   addition   to   our
international responsibilities to combat terrorism,  the  Government  has  a
responsibility to protect and defend democracy  and  our  Constitution.  The
Constitution guarantees every possible  lawful  means  of  waging  politics.
There is no reason, excuse or justification in this  country  to  revert  to
violence or threats thereof so as to bring about any  political,  social  or
other change.

The Government will not allow its territory to be the stage  for  such  acts
and threats emanating from anywhere.  The  Bill  before  this  House  is  an
extraordinary one in more ways that one. Firstly, it deals with  "terrorism"
- a concept with such  high  political  content  that  there  is  no  single
universal definition for it. We all  know  about  the  huge  debate  on  the
phrase ``one man's freedom fighter is  another's  terrorist''.  This  debate
has  even  more  significance  in  South  Africa,  where  the  struggle  for
liberation against racism was internationally  recognised  as  a  legitimate
one.

This aspect has been dealt with in the Bill by striking a  balance,  on  the
one hand, by  recognising  the  legitimate  struggle  by  people  for  their
liberation, including the armed  struggle  against  colonialism,  aggression
and domination by  foreign  forces.  This  struggle  was  waged  within  the
confines of international law, specifically international humanitarian  law,
and excluded it from the  definition  of  a  terrorist  activity.  This  was
balanced, on the other  hand,  by  stating  that  political,  philosophical,
ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or  other  motives  shall  not  be  a
justifiable defence against any terrorist activity.

This approach is in line with the African continent's approach, as  set  out
in the African Union's Algiers Convention on the  Prevention  and  Combating
of Terrorism, and the position of  the  Nonaligned  Movement.  In  terms  of
definition, the Bill defines  the  concept  of  ``terrorist  activity''  and
creates an offence of terrorism in line with our international  obligations.
The Bill can be regarded as  an  omnibus  of  legislation,  dealing  with  a
number of amendments to other laws administered by a number of  departments.


This called for co-ordination and co-operation at  numerous  levels.  At  an
official level, the respective drafts and inputs were  co-ordinated  through
an interdepartmental counterterrorism  working  group,  where  all  relevant
departments are represented. In Parliament, the  extraordinary  route  taken
was that five portfolio committees were involved in the  draft  legislation,
namely,  Safety  and  Security,  Justice  and  Constitutional   Development,
Foreign Affairs, Finance and the Joint Standing Committee  on  Intelligence.
The Bill bears testimony to co-operation and a joint effort, which  sets  an
example.

The fact that the subject content of the Bill raised debates on issues  such
as constitutionality, the freedom of the press and detention  without  trial
made it especially controversial. In addition, accusations  were  made  that
the Bill was only drafted to please countries such as the United  States  of
America. It was realised years ago that there must be sensitivity  when  one
deals with legislation on terrorism. The legacy of  our  past  -  marred  by
detention without trial, third degree interrogation and deaths in  detention
- is just too fresh to ignore.  For  that  reason,  the  South  African  Law
Commission was approached by the then Minister for Safety  and  Security  in
November 1995 to review the laws relating to terrorists. This was done  with
the assistance of the SA Police Service.

When the events of September 11, 2001 occurred, they sparked  off  a  number
of resolutions of the Security Council of the United  Nations,  as  well  as
the adoption of counterterrorism legislation worldwide. The  Law  Commission
report was by that time almost finalised. It was decided  to  look  at  best
practice in this regard. In finalising the  report  and  draft  legislation,
cognisance was taken of draft model legislation of  the  Commonwealth,  such
as in  the  legislation  of  countries  like  Tanzania,  Uganda,  Mauritius,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Britain, France, the Russian Federation  and
numerous others.

Furthermore, there are  specific  obligations  stemming  from  international
instruments adopted way before September 11, 2001, in terms of  which  South
Africa was under  obligation  to  enact  specific  offences,  to  create  an
extended  jurisdiction  in  respect  of   those   offences   and   to   deal
legislatively with certain aspects of extradition. The need for  legislative
reform was  clear.  Our  review  of  legislation  in  this  regard  is  also
obligatory  in  terms  of  the  African  Union  Convention  and   Resolution
1373/2001 of the Security Council of the United  Nations.  South  Africa  is
still not party to all international conventions and protocols dealing  with
terrorism.

This Bill paves the way for  ratification  of  section  2,  the  last  three
remaining conventions on terrorism. In drafting  the  Bill,  cognisance  was
taken,  not  only  of  the  twelve  international  conventions  relating  to
terrorism, but also of the other conventions on terrorism, as  well  as  the
instruments of the European Union in  combating  terrorism.  The  volume  of
research and debate that went into the Bill over a number of years,  reflect
the effort that went into the drafting of the Bill.

The timing of the project since November 1995, the  terms  of  reference  of
the SA Law commission,  namely  to  review  the  legislation  pertaining  to
terrorism, to address the Republic's international obligations and to  align
it with the Constitution, shows clearly that  the  allegations  of  improper
motives behind the Bill are totally unfounded.

Our hard-fought struggle for democracy needs to be defended  against  terror
and other unconstitutional means aimed at political and other changes.

Lastly, the process of public consultation which preceded  the  finalisation
of the Bill was extraordinary in that the  SA  Law  Commission  published  a
discussion paper as far back  as  November  2000  for  public  comment.  The
comments received  were  taken  into  account  before  a  final  report  was
published by the SA Law Commission.

The portfolio committee allowed adequate  time  for  public  hearings  where
nongovernmental organisations, religious organisations, media  organisations
and  other  interested  parties  were  heard.  Thereafter,  further  written
submissions on the Bill were considered. We have invited interested  parties
not only to criticise the Bill, but to participate in the  process,  and  we
are thankful for the numerous inputs made.

The Bill before this House is not only needed, but overdue in order to  meet
our  national  and  international  responsibilities  in   respect   of   the
prevention and combating of terrorism. There is  no  place  in  our  nascent
democracy for unconstitutional violent activity, and South  Africa  will  in
this respect honour its commitments, as  clearly  expressed  in  the  United
Nations, the African Union and the Nonaligned Movement.

The purpose of the Anti-Terrorism Bill in short is: to  align  the  national
laws of the Republic  in  order  to  meet  its  international  and  regional
obligations in respect of the prevention and combating of terrorism, and  to
ensure that the Republic has the  necessary  legislative  tools  to  address
terrorist threats of a local character.

The salient points of the Bill are as follows,  in  addition  to  a  general
offence of terrorism,  which  comprises  the  commission  of  any  terrorist
activity, the Bill  creates  offences  in  respect  of  acts  associated  or
connected with terrorist activities. The following are  convention  offences
derived from the international instruments of the UN and  the  AU,  referred
to above: offences associated or connected with the financing  of  specified
offences, offences relating to hijacking of aircraft, offences  relating  to
endangering the safety of maritime  navigation,  offences  relating  to  the
taking of hostages, offences relating to internationally protected  persons,
and offences relating to destroying  or  endangering  the  safety  of  fixed
platforms.

By  definition,  the  convention  offences  in  the  Bill  include  existing
offences in our national legislation which have been adopted in the past  to
give effect to international instruments pertaining to civil aviation.

Other offences created in the Bill  to  supplement  the  main  offences  are
offences relating to the harbouring and concealment of  persons  related  to
terrorist activities, the duty to report the presence of  persons  suspected
of intending to commit or having committed an offence and failure to  report
such offence, offences relating to hoaxes,  threats,  attempts,  conspiracy,
and inducing another person to commit offences.

The penalties provided in the Bill  are  sufficiently  deterrent  and  could
result in a penalty of imprisonment for life, or a fine of a  R100  million.
Prescribed sentences are provided for  in  the  Bill  in  cases  where,  for
example, the offence endangered the life or  caused  serious  bodily  injury
to,  or  the  death  of  any  person,  or  caused  the  destruction  of,  or
substantial damage to any property, natural resource, or the environment  or
cultural  heritage,  or  caused  a  major   economic   loss   or   extensive
destabilisation of an  economic  system,  or  devastation  of  the  national
economy of the Republic, or created a serious public emergency situation  or
a general insurrection.
The Bill further provides for both civil and criminal  asset  forfeiture  to
combat the financing of terrorists and related activities. These  provisions
are supported by appropriate amendments through the Bill to  the  Prevention
of Organised Crime Act. Provision is made in the Bill for the  President  to
publish, in the Government Gazette, the names of entities so  identified  by
the Security Council.

The Bill deals with jurisdiction and the surrender of persons  suspected  of
commission offences where the state has jurisdiction and no  prosecution  is
intended in South Africa. The Extradition Act is also amended by  the  Bill.
The Bill provides authority to the SA  Police  Service  to  cordon  off  and
search areas on the basis of a warrant issued by a judge.

The Bill will ensure that the Republic has the necessary  legislative  tools
to address terrorist threats of a national and local character. I move  that
the Protection of Constitutional Democracy  Against  Terrorist  and  Related
Activities Bill be adopted by the House. [Applause.]

Mr M E GEORGE: Madam Deputy Speaker, Deputy Minister Matthews,  hon  members
of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, in 1994 South Africa proudly  became  a
legitimate democratic state, and has since been  formulating  transformative
laws that would continue to sustain the hard-fought and won  democracy.  But
it must be acknowledged that in any legitimate democratic country,  such  as
South Africa, laws are not just  passed  randomly  for  the  sake  of  being
progressive. Each law that is formulated by this Parliament is  only  passed
if it is, first and foremost, constitutional and relevant to  the  country's
citizens' needs.

I then humbly welcome, and take this opportunity to commend,  this  Bill  as
constitutional and  relevant  towards  transforming  security  apparatus  of
safety and security for all the peoples of South Africa.  The  relevance  of
this Bill started way back in 1995 when the  then  Minister  of  Safety  and
Security, Comrade Sydney Mufamadi,  requested  the  SA  Law  Commission,  in
terms of  the  South  African  Law  Commission  Act,  Act  19  of  1973,  to
investigate and review South Africa's security legislation.

We all know how the notorious apartheid Internal Security  Act,  Act  74  of
1982, was systematically and extensively used to  shame  and  humiliate  our
comrades through torture. We do not want to dwell  too  long  on  the  well-
known brutality and inhuman exploitation which the security branch  and  the
military intelligence of the SA Defence Force inflicted on  anyone  who  was
against the racist apartheid system.

When the ANC then came to power in 1994, this Government  vowed  that  never
again would a citizen of  this  country,  or  anyone  for  that  matter,  be
subjected to this terrible and racist abuse. As we introduce  this  Bill  to
Parliament,  I  want  to  reiterate  and  echo  the  sentiments  which  were
expressed in 1994. Various processes  were  undertaken  to  make  sure  that
South  Africa  adopts  security  legislation  that  would  be  of   national
relevance, that would be of constitutional adherence, and that would  be  of
international standard.

The first turning  process  was  in  1996  when  this  Government  found  it
necessary  to  initiate  a  research  of  antiterrorism  legislation.   This
governmental initiative was of national relevance due to  a  spate  of  bomb
attacks that were  launched  against  innocent  civilians  and  against  the
police and police  stations  in  the  Western  Cape.  What  had  started  as
vigilantism against drugs  and  gangsterism,  became  a  political  conflict
omnibus.  All  of  a  sudden  the  ANC-led   Government   was   accused   of
collaborating with imperialist powers.

Clearly, the hard-fought and won democracy was under  seige  as  one  police
officer, Mr Benny Lategan, investigating these bomb attacks in  the  Western
Cape, was assassinated. Mr Piet Theron, a presiding officer in a  number  of
these bomb trials, was also assassinated outside  his  home.  From  this  we
learnt that this country was not immune from terrorism.

The SA Police Service drafted the first Bill on antiterrorism and  submitted
it for further amendments to the SA Law  Commission,  in  1999.  This  draft
Antiterrorism Bill was, for the first time, officially tabled in this  House
in 2000.

We have been reminded by critics that this is the fourth time this House  is
introducing the Bill. A curious question might  then  be  posed:  Why?  Many
people had alluded to so many things  in  trying  to  answer  this  critical
question. On the one hand, some critics commented that  the  previous  Bills
had to be withdrawn because no new law was necessary  to  curb  the  Western
Cape bombings. They claimed that the  SA  Police  Service  had  successfully
used the existing legislation to crush and suppress the urban terror in  the
Western Cape and the right-wing bombings across the country.

This could easily sound true to the ear of  some  listeners  here.  However,
the terrorist bombings of the American embassies in Kenya  and  Tanzania  in
1998 have taught South Africa that the  face  of  terrorism  is  drastically
changing. Terrorist activities  know  no  boundaries.  Thus,  terrorism  can
never again be just a national or domestic issue. As  witnessed  in  Nairobi
and  Dar  es  Salaam,  international  terrorism  often  hits  the   innocent
civilians. South Africa, then, is obliged to be part  of  the  global  arena
that  seeks  to  combat  international   terrorism   through   international
instruments, conventions and protocols.

The  previous  draft  security  legislation  against  terrorist   activities
obviously had shortcomings when it came to international terrorism.  On  the
one hand, cynics have tried  to  respond  by  saying  that  the  process  of
formulating this Bill was actually a forced one.  These  cynics  claim  that
since 11 September 2001 the ANC-led Government has fast-tracked  legislation
on terrorism to fulfil the American imperialists'  and  their  self-interest
aims on security.

Some newspapers even  proclaimed  that  the  Government  was  interested  in
formulating legislation on terrorism solely  because  it  wanted  to  ban  a
certain organisation. The Daily News even  screamed,  I  quote:  "Government
manoeuvres for legislation to ban Pagad." That was on 11 September 2000.  It
must be said here and right now that this Government is  not  interested  in
banning or fighting against certain organisations or  sector  of  people  as
many critics have tried to suggest.

This legislation, as the title shows,  puts  more  emphasis  on  a  holistic
objective.  It  is  mostly  keen  on  protecting  our  democracy   and   our
Constitution against terrorists and related activities both in South  Africa
and elsewhere in the world. Indeed, it had to take four draft  Bills  before
Parliament could come up with this final legislation.  This  is  so  because
this  Parliament  refuses  to  pass  laws  that  are   short-term   coercive
responses. This Parliament has also  been  responsible  enough  to  consider
human rights-related discussions  made  during  recent  public  hearings  in
respect of the previous certified Anti-terrorism Bill.

The ANC-led Government should, then, pride itself  by  duly  reamending  the
previous certified Bill in order to address the several core areas of  human
rights concerns that were raised by the public. The process was complex  and
at times pitted comrades against each other due to the  painful  history  of
suffering inflicted by the apartheid Internal Security Act. In  contrast  to
the previous certified Bill that was introduced in  March  2003,  and  which
mostly concerned itself with a reactionary question of  ``How  much  of  our
freedom should we give up?'', this  current  Bill  obliges  us  to  ask  the
question, ``How can  we  protect  our  democracy  and  Constitution  against
terrorists and related activities?''

If the  previous  certified  Antiterrorism  Bill  violated  the  fundamental
rights of freedom of  speech,  the  right  to  silence  and  presumption  of
innocence until proven guilty, then this  Bill  restores  these  fundamental
liberties with immediate effect.  For  instance,  the  infamous  section  of
investigative hearings, a section that was the hottest  debacle  during  the
public hearings due to its alleged oppressive  and  unjust  provisions,  has
since been scrapped and replaced by the new Chapter 4 - in the  new  Bill  -
and powers to investigate or to prevent terrorists and related activities.
Clauses 22, 23 and 24 of Chapter  4  have  been  carefully  reformulated  to
align them with the spirit of  the  Bill  of  Rights.  The  provisions  that
evaded much of the constitutional protection afforded  to  the  accused  and
the wide powers that had been given to the police have now  been  completely
done away with in this new Bill. In this new Bill, the police  now  have  no
right to institute an investigation. Instead, this power  is  given  to  the
Director of Public Prosecutions. Also, the judge has no  right  to  issue  a
warrant of arrest. The judge may, now, only issue a  warrant  for  cordoning
off,  stopping  and  searching  vehicles  and  persons  -  with  a  view  to
preventing terrorist activities - to an under-oath police officer.

The Bill has also refrained from making membership an offence  because  this
is against the spirit of  our  Constitution,  section  18,  which  grants  a
person the right to freedom of association. Instead, a definition of  entity
has  been  included  in  clause  1(3)  to  target,   combat   and   prevent,
specifically,  terrorist  activities  or  active  supporters  of   terrorist
activities as opposed to terrorist organisations. By focusing on  activities
and active supporters of terrorist activities  rather  than  on  membership,
the  Bill  is  also  making  it  easier  for  the  relevant  law-enforcement
authorities to seize assets of persons acting in terrorist activities.

This Bill successfully harmonises  the  country's  domestic  laws  with  the
international instruments of counterterrorism in  the  process  of  obliging
South Africa, which is a member  state  of  both  the  OAU  and  the  United
Nations, to comply with international  standards  without  compromising  our
sovereignty  as  a  democratic  state.  For  instance,  the  United  Nations
Security  Council's  Resolution  137  compels  South  Africa  to   formulate
legislation that would provide for  extraterritorial  jurisdiction,  broaden
the offence of terrorism and address the financing of terrorism.

At the same time, the OAU Convention on  the  Prevention  and  Combating  of
Terrorism has made it possible for this Bill to distinguish  terrorists  and
related activities from legitimate liberation struggles against  colonialism
and foreign aggression. Clause 17 endorses this Bill. This proves that  this
Bill, entitled The Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against  Terrorist
and Related Activities Bill, has  been  formulated  through  a  multilateral
approach that responds to a full range of security concerns. It responds  to
the global aspects of liberation struggles  against  inequality,  exclusion,
foreign aggression and marginalisation of peoples.

The new Bill also endorses the  important  role  this  Parliament  plays  in
checking  that  our  legislative  autonomy  is  preserved   internationally.
Clauses 25 and 26 make sure that the President will not simply rely  on  the
United Nations Security Council's decision to  freeze  assets  or  property.
Instead, all  the  United  Nations  Security  Council's  listed  persons  or
entities, identified as committing or supporting or  facilitating  terrorist
activities, will be submitted  to  this  Parliament  for  consideration  and
decision.

Having said that, this Government has always and  will  continue  to  regard
the United Nations Security Council as one of the best options available  in
helping to prevent international terrorism. Globalisation  has  necessitated
interdependence against conflict and  war,  and  terrorism.  However,  being
obligated to United Nations standards does not mean that  South  Africa  has
suddenly become a puppet of international standards. On the contrary,  South
Africa continues to uphold its contextual policies,  which  could  sometimes
challenge, when necessary, inhumane behaviours  perpetuated  by  the  United
Nations member states. The Iraq crisis was a vivid example.

It is  important,  therefore,  for  this  Government  to  confirm  that  the
establishment  of  the  African  Union  in  July  2002   has   brought   new
possibilities to invigorate mechanisms against terrorist activities  in  the
continent of Africa. The peace  and  security  agenda  of  the  AU  economic
programme and Nepad continue to  link  political  security  and  development
issues at regional, national and community levels.

Seeing that my time is running out, I would be failing in my duty if I  were
not  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  legal  advisers  from  the
Department  of  Safety  and  Security,  the  Department   of   Justice   and
Constitutional Development and the SA Law Reform Commission  for  their  co-
operation and assistance in drafting this Bill. I  also  want  to  thank  my
colleague, Comrade Johnny de Lange, for the  extensive  work  that  he  did.
Lastly, I want to thank all parties, especially those parties who were  part
of the drafting, that is the DA, the New NP and the IFP.

I'm  not  omitting  others  because  I  have  anything  against  them,   but
unfortunately, probably because of their size, they  were  not  involved  in
the drafting of the Bill, and I want to say that our democracy is  maturing.
The support of this Bill by all parties is really  appreciated.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Adv P S SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker, the phrase  "collateral  damage",  when
used in military terms, is a very unfortunate concept.  It  relates  to  the
unintended, but consequential, death of civilians  and  damage  to  civilian
property as a result of military action. But when  used,  as  seems  popular
nowadays, with reference to terrorist and related activities, it is  nothing
but the vilest swear words;  not  a  phrase  we  want  introduced  into  the
vocabulary of our nation.

That is exactly the intention of this Bill;  the  protection  of  our  hard-
earned democracy and the wonderful document that is our Constitution,  which
is so much more than the paper it is written on. It embodies all that we  as
a proud nation believe in -  all  our  opportunities  and  dreams,  all  our
rights and freedoms, but also our obligations. It protects the country  with
its entire people, both strong and vulnerable, across all  racial,  cultural
or religious boundaries.

Maar daar is 'n probleem. Wanneer  ek  terugdink  aan  die  inhoud  van  die
aanvanklike wetsontwerp wat in hierdie Huis ter tafel  geplaas  is,  is  dit
steeds met skok  en  ontnugtering;  'n  wetsontwerp  wat  deur  die  Kabinet
goedgekeur is en wat deur die staatsregsadviseurs, kundige mense,  spesifiek
op grondwetlike aspekte,  gesertifiseer  is,  met  soveel  tekortkominge  en
ongrondwetlike bepalings dat dit in die snippermandjie hoort. As dit is  wat
die Kabinet, deur hulle goedkeuring aangedui, van ons Grondwet  dink,  vrees
ek vir die behoud van ons demokrasie en die kosbare Handves van Menseregte.

Gelukkig het al die partye in die  portefeuljekomitee,  die  ANC  ingesluit,
reeds  tydens  die  eerste  bespreking,  nog  voor  die  openbare   verhore,
saamgestem dat die wetsontwerp drasties herskryf moet word.  Ongelukkig  was
die belangegroepe op daardie dokument, wat ek aarsel om  'n  wetsontwerp  te
noem, reeds aangewys vir die openbare verhore. Die gevolg  was  'n  openbare
proses wat bloot die reeds geïdentifiseerde probleme  uitgelig  het.  Vandag
is dit steeds bykans onmoontlik  om  bekommerdes  te  oortuig  dat  dit  wat
vandag bespreek word drasties verskil van  die  eerste  konsep  en  dat  hul
probleme  en  vrese  behandel  is.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[But there is a problem. When I cast my mind back to  the  contents  of  the
initial Bill that was tabled in this House,  it  is  still  with  shock  and
disillusionment; a Bill that was ratified  by  the  Cabinet  and  certified,
specifically  on  constitutional  aspects,  by  the  state   law   advisors,
knowledgeable   people,   while   it   has   so   many   shortcomings    and
unconstitutional provisions that it belongs in the dustbin. If this is  what
the Cabinet, as indicated by their approval, thinks of our  Constitution,  I
fear for the preservation of our democracy  and  the  precious  Charter  for
Human Rights.

Fortunately all the parties in the portfolio committee,  the  ANC  included,
had already agreed during the  first  discussion,  even  before  the  public
hearings, agreed that the Bill  would  have  to  be  drastically  redrafted.
Unfortunately the  interest  groups  relating  to  that  document,  which  I
hesitate to call a Bill, were already designated for  the  public  hearings.
The result  was  a  public  process  that  merely  highlighted  the  already
identified problems. Today it is still almost impossible to convince  people
who are concerned that what is being discussed today  differs  greatly  from
the first draft and that their problems and fears have been addressed.]

Working together with the Portfolio Committee  on  Justice,  we  immediately
deleted certain sections which included all  the  major  complaints  by  the
participants at the public hearings. These were  sections  making  provision
for so-called investigative hearings, which  reeked  of  the  old  detention
without trial concept. It included obligations on the media, powers  to  the
Minister to declare certain organisations as terrorist organisations  and  a
number of offences and penalties for  anybody  in  almost  any  way,  having
anything to do with anybody who is a member  of  these  so-called  terrorist
organisations. As these were all quickly expunged from  the  Bill,  I  shall
refrain from discussing those details.

Spending time and effort with comparative studies of similar legislation  in
other  countries,  fine-tuning  definitions,  drafting  and  redrafting,  we
eventually came to a final product. This should put to  rest  all  fears  by
law-abiding citizens of infringements on their human or other  rights  while
still empowering our security agencies with the means to act  decisively  to
protect our people from this worldwide phenomenon of terrorism  and  in  all
aspects fulfil our international obligations. A lot  of  thought  went  into
the proper definition of terrorist activity and I am of the opinion that  we
probably came as close as possible to a universally  acceptable  definition.
Sufficient detailed provision is made for intent as element to  prevent  our
courts from too broad an interpretation of this activity.

With detailed and specific definitions to ensure  clarity  on  all  aspects,
the Bill now achieves its aims, without  giving  any  additional  powers  to
security agencies - apart from the cordoning off of  areas  for  search  and
seizure that they do not already have. In all instances  these  and  related
matters  are  dealt  with  through  the  courts'  and  highest   prosecuting
authorities' involvement. No prosecution  in  terms  of  this  Bill  may  be
instituted without the written authority of the National Director of  Public
Prosecutions.
The Bill provides  for  the  following:  The  creation  of  the  offence  of
terrorism, in line with the definition, and a  whole  series  of  convention
offences, fulfilling our international  obligations.  We  addressed  various
lacunae in our legislation, which I think at  last  will  put  to  rest  the
argument that we do not need this new legislation; offences relating to  the
harbouring or the concealment of persons committing specified offences;  the
duty to  report  the  presence  of  a  person  suspected,  hoaxes,  threats,
attempted conspiracies and inducing another person to commit such  offences;
jurisdictional  matters,  with  specific  reference  to   extradition;   and
evidential matters and certain exclusions. Of importance  is  section  1(4),
which makes provision for  legitimate  struggles  by  people  in  furthering
their rights to national liberation, self-determination and independence  to
be excluded from the definition of terrorist activity.

It also deals with: Penalties and matters relating to  penalties,  including
the increase  in  the  jurisdiction  of  the  magistrate's  court  regarding
certain offences to a fine of R250 000 and imprisonment of up  to  5  years;
and certain investigative powers - nothing new in our law  -  in  particular
with reference to financial  matters.  I  can  refer  to,  inter  alia,  the
existing Prevention of Organised Crime Act and  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre Act. And lastly, notification through proclamation in the Gazette  by
the President of a  specific  entity,  identified  by  the  United  Nation's
Security Council with reference to terrorist or related activities. In  this
regard it only pertains to Chapter 7 of the  UN  Charter,  relating  to  the
financing of certain entities. We legislated for such a notice to be  tabled
in Parliament for decision and action.  There  is,  therefore,  no  internal
identification or declaration of any entity as a terrorist  organisation  as
envisaged in the original Bill.

A number of existing laws were  amended  and,  lastly,  the  name  has  been
changed to emphasise the  move  away  from  terrorism  as  a  phenomenon  to
terrorist and related activities and the protection  of  our  constitutional
democracy in that regard.

My thanks go to the hon Mluleki  George  for  his  able  chairpersonship  of
these long and exhaustive meetings, as well as the other members. I want  to
particularly thank the hon Johnny de Lange,  Chairperson  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Justice, for his hard work and the  important  role  he  played
during the long process of  fixing  up  a  real  mess.  Also  thanks  to  my
colleague, the hon Sheila Camerer, for her valuable  input  and  assistance.
She will later touch on the constitutionality of the Bill and human rights.

We need to pay special tribute to Dr Jacobs and all the drafters  for  their
imput. All this dedication and continuous hard work brought to completion  a
Bill that, in my humble opinion, can be regarded as  a  well-balanced  piece
of legislation, achieving its aims  without  impeding  in  any  way  on  the
rights of law-abiding citizens. The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister  and  members,
ladies and gentlemen - sorry I did not see the Minister - and  hon  Minister
as well, on behalf of the ANC I  rise  on  this  occasion  in  unconditional
support of the  adoption  of  the  Protection  of  Constitutional  Democracy
Against Terrorist and Related Activities Bill and commend the Bill  to  this
House.

I commence by  endorsing  all  those  who  have  been  thanked  by  previous
speakers, especially the team of four drafters who  assisted  the  committee
and were ably led by Dr Jacobs. But it will be completely remiss of  me  not
to thank our chairperson, Comrade Mluleki George,  the  Chairperson  of  the
Lead Committee, for his sterling work. He held a  very  firm,  yet  flexible
and inclusive hand over the processing of this Bill. Special  mention  needs
to be made of the manner in which he  allowed  enormous  latitude  to  those
presenting oral submissions before  the  committees.  No  complaint  can  be
levelled that they were not granted optimal  opportunity  to  present  their
views, in some instances with much fanfare, opportunism and provocation.  He
can claim to be the midwife of a piece of legislation which he can be  proud
of. A thoughtful and carefully drafted Bill, which  in  my  view  meets  our
national security needs, as far as it is possible within our  present  legal
framework, with a minimum necessary further restriction  of  the  rights  of
citizens while passing muster  on  issues  of  constitutionality,  legality,
morality and desirability, despite the inclusion in some  respects  of  new,
innovative and refreshing  approaches.  In  particular  he  should  also  be
congratulated as he was able to obtain the unanimous  approval  of  all  the
parties that were involved in this process.

During the year  2000  Mr  Martin  Schonteich  commented  on  the  potential
terrorist threat facing South Africa as follows:


  During 1998 some 567 attacks that police alleged were gang  or  terrorism
  related, including pipe bombings, petrol bombings and drive-by  shootings
  were perpetrated in the greater Cape Town area. A hundred and sixty-eight
  arrests were made as a consequence of these attacks. On the first day  of
  1999, a car bomb exploded  outside  the  V&A  Waterfront  in  Cape  Town,
  injuring two persons. A few weeks later, another car bomb exploded at the
  entrance of the Caledon Square  police  station  in  central  Cape  Town,
  injuring eleven. In November of the same year  a  bomb  placed  inside  a
  popular beachfront restaurant in the city injured 48. A few  days  before
  the end of the year, a police vehicle  was  ambushed.  The  seven  police
  officers in the police vehicle who were responding to a  telephonic  bomb
  threat were injured as the bomb exploded outside the restaurant they went
  to.

More recently, in 2002, there were two acts of domestic terrorism  in  South
Africa. Firstly, a series of bombings in Soweto in late October. One  person
was killed and one wounded. Then again, in mid-November of the same year,  a
pipe bomb exploded at a police unit in Cape Town, but no injuries occurred.

Despite overwhelming empirical evidence that South Africa, since the  advent
of  our  hard-fought  democracy,  faces  a   potential   terrorist   threat,
admittedly to varying degrees from  various  quarters,  including  religious
fundamentalists, right-wing extremists and racists from within  the  country
and also from persons outside the country involving themselves in  terrorist
activities  and  seeking  a   safe   haven   here,   some   still   contend,
astonishingly, that no such threat exists.

Others contend, wrongly in my view, that even if such a threat  exists,  our
security forces have within the boundaries of the present law and  resources
been able to meet and deal with such threat as it has manifested  itself  to
date and no need exists for further legislative  intervention.  Others  have
gone so far as to ludicrously suggest that South Africa is a puppet  of  the
United States, Britain,  Israel  and  other  imperialist  interests,  merely
acting as rubber  a  stamp  by  assiduously  and  diligently  promoting  and
implementing  President   Bush's   so-called   "War   Against   Terrorism'',
especially his Patriot Act. Some even outrageously argued that  the  present
legislation is our direct  response  to  the  bombing  of  the  World  Trade
Centre, that is, 9/11. Others have even, mind-bogglingly  so,  averred  that
the present legislation is the same as the apartheid  security  legislation.
If men are from Mars and women are from Venus, you must wonder  where  these
aliens are from.

Not much good can come from once again dealing with all the responses to  be
made in respect of such  assertions,  especially  the  more  outrageous  and
hysterical elements thereof. I rather prefer to spend my time on  reflecting
on the approach of the ANC and the Government on the  constitutionality  and
the desirability  of  introducing  counter-terrorism  legislation  in  South
Africa.

One has often heard the refrain here  and  abroad,  especially  recently  in
South Africa with the introduction of counter-terrorism  legislation,  of  a
possible conflict between the respect for human rights and the rule of  law,
on the one hand, and the  prevention  and  combating  of  terrorism  on  the
other. There is no such conflict between the respect for  human  rights  and
the combating of terrorism. No person who supports human rights can  support
terrorism, which usually results in a grave violation of such human  rights.
Terrorism is the mortal enemy of a human rights  culture  and  the  rule  of
law. Terrorism respects neither rules, nor law, nor human rights. The  state
has the responsibility for the security of our land  and  its  citizens  and
therefore also for the fight against terrorism.

A symbiotic relationship exists between the national  security  of  a  state
and the security of life, limb and property of  its  citizens  who  comprise
the sum total of such state. No rational government can  afford  to  off-set
the one against the other. Rational and thoughtful nations  are  not  driven
and governed by and through emotion and populism. The scourge  of  terrorism
is condemned unconditionally and  countered  without  equivocation  by  such
nations. But, a prudent and emphatic nation will always do so  guided  by  a
human rights culture, which strikes a  principled,  yet  pragmatic,  balance
between the enjoyment and protection of freedoms and human  rights  and  the
legitimate concerns of its citizens and for its national security.

In these times of the so-called "War Against Terrorism", we  need  to  guard
against, on the one hand, the quick-fix solutions  and  knee-jerk  reactions
of some world leaders and countries which view tolerance and inclusivity  as
luxuries and  not  a  way  of  life  and,  on  the  other  hand,  the  moral
equivocation of others, often including  so-called  civil  libertarians,  to
condemn and advocate zero tolerance towards terrorist acts.

The struggle against terrorism must  always  be  contextualised  within  the
limits of struggle for human rights and human dignity and  of  international
peace and security. Therefore, counterterrorism  legislation  must,  at  its
core, involve the most fundamental of rights, namely, the  individual  right
to life, liberty and security of each person and freedom from fear, and  the
collective right to peace and security for humankind. Even  the  implication
of the often-quoted mantra that "one person's terrorist is another  person's
freedom fighter", which often leads to a moral or legal blurring  of  issues
or debates around  acts  of  terrorism,  cannot  and  should  not  form  the
foundational or justificatory basis of a principled counterterrorism Bill.

Simply put,  true  freedom  fighters  or  revolutionaries  do  not  blow  up
civilians indiscriminately. In any case, this approach depends  entirely  on
the subjective world-view of  the  definer.  According  to  this  school  of
thought, it would be sufficient to say what looks like a  terrorist,  sounds
like a terrorist  and  behaves  like  a  terrorist,  is  a  terrorist.  This
position, naturally, contributes nothing to the understanding  of  an  issue
fraught with difficulties and complexities. It amounts to nothing more  than
a zero sum analysis.

The message from every true democrat, civil  libertarian,  freedom  fighter,
revolutionary, and caring  and  thinking  nation  should  be  that  acts  of
terrorism from whatever quarter, for  whatever  purpose,  are  unacceptable,
the anathema of the enjoyment and protection  of  human  rights  and  it  is
unequivocally condemned. Likewise the message from the same  persons  should
be that the fight against terrorism  from  whatever  quarter,  for  whatever
purpose, at the expense of the undue restriction of human rights or  outside
the rule of law or by overzealous securocrats, is equally unacceptable,  the
anathema of human rights culture and unequivocally rejected.

This approach is most eloquently  captured  by  the  British  scholar,  Paul
Wilkins, in his writings, Terrorism and the Liberal State:


  The  primary  objective  of  a  counterterrorism  strategy  must  be  the
  protection and maintenance of liberal democracy and the rule of  law.  It
  cannot be sufficiently stressed that this  aim  overrides  in  importance
  even the objective of eliminating terrorism  and  political  violence  as
  such. Any bloody tyrant can `solve' a problem of political violence if he
  is prepared to sacrifice all considerations of humanity, and  to  trample
  down constitutional and judicial rights ... To believe that it  is  worth
  snuffing out all individual rights and sacrificing liberal values for the
  sake of `order' is to fall into the error of terrorists  themselves,  the
  folly of believing that the  end  justifies  the  means.  It  must  be  a
  cardinal value of liberal democracies in dealing with problems  of  civil
  violence and terrorism, however serious these may be, never to be tempted
  to using the method of tyrants and totalitarians. ... It is  a  dangerous
  illusion to believe one can `protect'  liberal  democracy  by  suspending
  liberal rights and forms of government. Contemporary history abounds with
  examples of  `emergency'  or  `military'  rule  carrying  countries  from
  democracy to dictatorship with irrevocable ease ... The  keynote  to  the
  liberal democratic  response  to  terrorism  must  be  firmness  and  the
  determination to uphold the constitutional authority and the rule of law.

In line with this approach, the present South  African  Government  did  not
respond to this potential  terrorist  threat  in  a  knee-jerk  or  populist
manner, nor with undue haste. The  thoughtful  response  of  Government  was
twofold. The first response was in November 1995, to refer  the  review  and
possible rationalisation of the security legislation in South Africa to  the
SA Law Commission for consideration and  report.  These  original  terms  of
reference were later updated and amended. The end result  of  this  process,
seven years later - I emphasise "seven years later", because many  say  that
we suddenly rushed this through  Parliament  because  of  things  that  have
happened in other countries lately - is the Bill  now  serving  before  this
House for debate and adoption.

The second response, as Mr Schonteich has pointed out on  occasion,  was  in
1998, when the South African Government approved a new  official  policy  on
terrorism.  According  to  this  policy,  the  Government  is  committed  to
upholding the rule of law, never  resorting  to  any  form  of  general  and
indiscriminate repression to defend and uphold the freedom and  security  of
all its citizens and to acknowledging and respecting its obligations to  the
international community.

According to this policy, the Government further shall condemn all  acts  of
terror; take all lawful measures to prevent acts of terror and to  bring  to
justice those who are involved in acts of terror and  undertake  to  protect
foreign citizens from acts of terror in South Africa; in  the  event  of  an
act of terror in a foreign country involving a South  African  citizen,  co-
operate  with  the  host  government  to  resolve  the  matter;   not   make
concessions that could encourage extortion  by  terrorists;  not  allow  its
territory to be used as a haven to plan, direct or support acts  of  terror;
support and co-operate with the international community in their efforts  to
prevent and combat acts of  terror  and  use  all  appropriate  measures  to
combat terrorism; and support its citizens who are victims of terrorism.

These responses were already the responses of this  Government  in  the  mid
and late 1990s. The whole suggestion that we keep  having  to  hear,  and  I
have been reading about in the newspapers  again  recently,  over  and  over
again that  we  have  suddenly  passed  this  legislation  or  that  we  are
responding to 9/11 because of the attack on the World Trade Centre  is  just
so much cockypop that it is really embarrassing that  people  can  even  put
such views forward. [Interjections.] Well, I can use a  stronger  word,  but
this is a family show, so I am not going to do so.

It is actually embarrassing to the  intelligence  of  the  persons  who  say
these things. If they just do the slightest bit of  reading,  which  I  know
most of them do not, then they would  find  the  answers  to  that  kind  of
ridiculous suggestions that have been made.

Now it has been pointed out by others that, during the  public  hearings,  a
host of problem areas have crystallised, which  we  have  dealt  with  in  a
completely redrafted piece of legislation. First, there  is  the  definition
of terrorism. Although there is no internationally accepted  definition,  we
were able to draft a definition which I feel is very well balanced.  It  has
at least three elements the state has to prove; firstly, an act.  There  are
nine different acts that can be proved. These  are  all  best  practices  in
most of the world. Secondly, the state has to prove that  the  person  acted
with a certain intention and then three possible intentions  are  spelt  out
in the legislation. And thirdly, and very importantly, the  state  also  has
to show that a specific motive was the guiding force of  the  act  that  has
been perpetrated. And then, very importantly - I am  not  sure  about  this,
but we are probably one of the few countries in the world that has  done  so
- we have also excluded from the operation of this Bill all acts  that  were
committed during true liberation struggles elsewhere in the world that  were
fought  in  accordance  with  and  are  defined  within  the  parameters  of
international law. This exclusion exists in this legislation.

I am proud to have been  associated  with  this  legislation,  and  I  thank
everyone who has made it possible to  bring  this  legislation  before  this
House. I am sure that we  can  all  sleep  a  bit  safer  tonight,  although
whatever is on paper is not necessarily the solution to the  problem.  Thank
you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Does the hon Sheila Camerer  know  the
difference between poppycock and cockypop? We will wait for her to tell  us.
[Laughter.]
Mr  E  T  FERREIRA:  Chairperson,  when  a  country   considers   antiterror
legislation, it has  to  do  so  with  great  circumspection.  Antiterrorism
legislation inevitably curtails some freedoms that citizens  normally  would
enjoy. When you live in South Africa, of course, considering our  dark  past
with security legislation that makes your hair raise, one  has  to  be  even
more careful. After long deliberations and very careful  consideration  over
a period of literally months, the IFP sees its  way  clear  to  support  the
Bill before us here today. Generally known and also introduced as the  Anti-
Terrorism Bill,  it  now  has  a  more  fancy  name  of  the  Protection  of
Constitutional Democracy Against  Terrorist  and  Related  Activities  Bill.
Taking into consideration what a politically  correct  bunch  of  people  we
have become in South Africa, some people may well feel  that  this  name  is
more suitable.

The Bill before us has had a very long and painful path, and has  been  very
controversial from day one. One can safely say that in its original form  it
had virtually no chance of surviving a  constitutionality  test.  It  looked
too much like old South Africa security legislation. Opponents of  the  Bill
had all the reasons in the world to shoot  it  down  in  flames.  We  simply
cannot go back to detention without trial. No way could  we  have  supported
the Minister declaring organisations as terrorist organisations as  he  sees
fit.

Amongst other things, the above were removed and over a very long period  of
time the Bill was  changed  to  the  extent  that  it  would  make  it  very
difficult not to support it now. Compared  to  antiterror  legislation  from
most other countries in the world, that do have such legislation, this  Bill
cannot be seen as unreasonable in any way. We also believe  that  this  Bill
before us will have no problem in passing a constitutionality  test,  should
it be challenged - which is unlikely.

One gets the distinct impression that the opponents to this  Bill  are  more
opposed because of their perceptions of this Bill than to its realities.  It
reminds one of the opposition from large sections of the  community  to  the
Firearms Control Bill not too long ago. Things will go  so  much  better  in
our country if people will concentrate more on  reality  and  a  little  bit
less on perception. There is, of course, the notion that we have  sufficient
laws in our country to deal with terrorism. Some  professional  commentators
say that we have over 40 pieces of  legislation  to  deal  with  terror  and
related attacks quite effectively. There is undoubtedly a lot  of  merit  in
this argument. The question  can  be  asked  as  to  whether  we  need  this
legislation at all.

We  handled  the  threat  of  urban  terror  in  the  Western   Cape   quite
effectively, even though it might have taken a bit  longer  than  what  most
people were hoping for. The Boeremag threats were flattened  in  just  about
no time. This would not have been possible had we not had  good  legislation
in place to deal with those acts of terror.  Terrorism  is  much  more  than
mere actions though. There are other threats and activities which also  need
to be covered more thoroughly by a Bill like  this.  People  who  make  hoax
calls of bombs, explosions and threats, or any other forms of  intimidation,
must realise that, in future, they can go to jail for up to 10  years.  This
sounds very harsh, but hoaxes disrupt people's lives and  the  economy,  and
they do more psychological harm to the citizens than many people would  ever
realise.

I must be honest in saying that the IFP will have  no  sympathy  for  people
who spend many years in jail as a result of making hoax  calls.  As  I  have
mentioned, the point can be argued that we have enough legislation in  South
Africa to deal with terrorism. The point which  cannot  be  argued  against,
however,  is  that  current  legislation  does  not  cater   for   all   the
international agreements and accords that South Africa has become party  to.


This  Bill  is  undoubtedly  necessary  in  order  for  us  to  fulfil   our
international obligations. The provision in  the  Bill  which  makes  it  an
offence to  give  financial  support  to  terrorist  organisations  is  very
controversial. It must be  remembered  though  that  one  could  still  give
financial support to liberation movements whose members are accepted by  the
United Nations as freedom fighters. There are many  people  in  our  country
who have the perception that it is a United States inspired Bill,  resulting
directly from September 11. As was evident quite early in the  debate,  this
Bill had been in the pipeline for more than five years before  September  11
even occurred. This, again, is an example of people's perception versus  the
actual reality.

We have a democracy in our country. Many of us  are  not  necessarily  happy
with the way the ANC is running our country. We  have  every  reason  to  be
very unhappy about the manner  in  which  the  Government  is  dealing  with
crime, unemployment and Aids. At the end of the day, however,  we  have  the
right and the freedom to convince  the  public  at  large  to  replace  this
Government at the ballot box. The sooner we do this, of course, the  better.
However, we have neither the right, nor moral right,  to  revert  to  terror
and terrorism to get our way. There can be no  sympathy  for  terrorists  or
their activities.

This Bill is not aimed at a single individual, organisation or  a  group  of
people in South Africa. This Bill is antiterror and  antiterrorism,  nothing
more or less. Let us not make any apologies for this Bill.

Mr G SOLOMON: Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of Safety and  Security,  hon
members of the House, my task this afternoon is to  deal  particularly  with
Muslim responses to this Bill.

Muslim responses to this Bill  can  only  be  understood  in  terms  of  the
character of their faith, Islam, and particularly the important  concept  of
ummah, which is known to Muslims as  a  universal  community  of  faith  and
solidarity.

It therefore follows that  what  is  happening  in  Palestine,  Afghanistan,
Bosnia, Chechnya, Kashmir and recently in Iraq, or anywhere  in  the  Muslim
world, will have a profound effect upon Muslim responses  to  this  critical
and sensitive piece of legislation.

I am not suggesting  here  that  Muslims  are  an  entirely  homogeneous  or
monolithic group, but there is more  than  enough  common  ground  in  their
basic faith to invoke a united response from Kabul to Cape Town to  whatever
they perceive,  rightly  or  wrongly,  as  affecting  their  dignity,  their
identity and aspirations as Muslims.

The notion that the United States of America is behind this Bill,  and  that
this Bill will largely discriminate against Muslims and Islam, is  one  that
pervades the responses  of  all  Muslim  groups  from  the  Muslim  Judicial
Council; the United Ulama Council of South Africa;  the  progressive  group,
the Call of Islam;  the  Islamic  Forum  and  the  professional  group,  the
Association of Accountants and Lawyers for Islamic Law and others.

This is not surprising if one considers  the  treatment  meted  out  by  the
United States Government  against  Muslims  accused  of  terrorism  held  in
Quantanamo Bay; and the statements  attributed  to  Muslim  countries,  like
Afghanistan, Iraq or the Sudan; and the threat of aggression against a  host
of others.

It is certainly not in the best interest of world  peace  and  stability  if
the United States of America, as a superpower, and its allies  display  such
profoundly blatant moral duplicity and double standards in response  to  the
serious problem of international terrorism and  related  activities  in  the
world.

Because of this, one can understand and empathise with Muslim  responses  in
our country to this particular Bill.  The  United  States  of  America,  for
example, will condemn activities as terrorist when committed by factions  in
the legitimate struggle for  self-determination  by  the  Palestinians,  but
will subsidise Israeli state terrorism  against  the  houses  and  lives  of
innocent civilians in occupied Palestine. The United States  of  America  is
also known to have subsidised terrorism in the case of Unita in  Angola  and
of the Contras in Nicaragua.

I am not making out a case for terrorist activities - whether from  national
states, liberation movements or individuals. What I  am  saying  is,  if  we
have an international problem of terrorist and related  activities,  why  do
we not get together as equal partners and pool our expertise  and  resources
in an  international  conference  on  sustainable  international  peace  and
security?

Unilateral  action  has  convincingly  been  proven  to  be  disastrous  and
counterproductive. Under the circumstances, the least that  is  expected  is
fairness and justice of policy on the  part  of  whoever  is  serious  about
regional or international peace and security.

I am not aware of  any  Muslim  state  which  disagrees  that  international
terrorist and related activities need to be addressed in a very serious  but
just and fair manner in a  multilateral  way.  Despite  this,  there  is  an
overarching  universal  perception  that  the  problem  is  located   almost
entirely in the  Arab,  Muslim  and  Islamic  world  with  this  frightening
concept of Jihad, and its association with suicide bombings at  the  centre.
The concept of Jihad is so widely  misconstrued  internationally  that  even
Muslims erroneously immediately associate the term with  conflict,  violence
and war.
But prominent Muslim academics  and  religious  scholars  and  some  of  the
world's most progressive intellectuals across the religious divide,  amongst
them Edward Said, Rosemary Said, Noam Chomsky, Ali  Mazrui  and  Amin  Samir
have critiqued this concept in the Middle East milieu precisely  because  it
refers to a wide range  of  endeavours;  including  political  negotiations,
social and political actions and even personal human  transformations,  and,
of course, to take up arms if necessary.

To the Muslim mind, the label "terrorist", particularly after September  11,
has become a convenient cover to defy Muslim  governments  as  evil  and  as
part of a  collective  axis  of  evil,  which  itself  reflects  a  type  of
religious fundamentalism. This is then conveniently used  as  a  pretext  to
invade, destroy and occupy.

The response to this type of treatment is  the  lethal  human  weapon  of  a
suicide bomber, with which the world is so familiar today. Maybe the  United
States of America and its allies  should  reflect  seriously  on  the  noble
Christian rule "do not do unto others what you would not they do unto you".

The fact of the matter is that a correct  understanding  of  Islam  and  its
world view clearly indicates that peace with justice is the  preferred  norm
and option in Islam.

On the homefront in the Western Cape, Pagad  -  People  against  Gangsterism
and Drugs - succeeded in its formative years to  attract  great  support  by
focusing its image as defender of the rights of families to  an  environment
safe from gangsters and drugs. Indeed, a  very  noble  cause.  However,  the
violence that came to be identified with it, particularly  urban  terror  in
Cape Town, eventually lost it its credibility.

In the Pagad case, as a predominantly Muslim phenomenon,  appropriating  the
symbol of Jihad,  clearly  violence  did  not  sustain  the  movement  in  a
constitutional democracy like South Africa, where  the  rule  of  law  is  a
fundamental principle.

What  is  our  position  with  the  introduction  of   the   Protection   of
Constitutional Democracy against  Terrorist  and  Related  Activities  Bill?
South Africa is a constitutional democracy, where fundamental  human  rights
such as the right to life  and  freedom  and  free  political  activity  are
constitutionally enshrined and many of the other things have been stated  by
my colleagues here.

To what extent  then  did  the  relevant  portfolio  committees  accommodate
Muslim concerns? The minority who have a principled opposition to  the  Bill
can unfortunately not be accommodated.

South  Africa  is  an  independent  and  sovereign  country  with  national,
regional and international duties and obligations. It is  committed  to  the
United Nations, to the African Union and to the Non-Aligned Movement in  the
matter of the prevention and combating of terrorist and  related  activities
through international co-operation. It  would  be  highly  irresponsible  of
South Africa not to heed these obligations.

For the rest their  concerns  were,  amongst  others,  that  the  Bill  will
largely discriminate against Muslims and Islam. Here I would like  to  state
that Muslims have made  a  significant  contribution  to  the  struggle  for
freedom in  South  Africa.  They  have  exercised,  in  fact,  their  Jihad,
together   with   others,   to   bring   down   apartheid.   Muslims    have
enthusiastically  embraced  the  democratic  process   under   the   ANC-led
Government with the freedoms which they enjoy as a religious community  with
the rest of society. The Bill is not about to interfere with any of this.

We can assure Muslims  that  this  Bill  does  not,  in  any  way,  hope  to
interfere with any of the freedoms that  they  enjoy,  and  that  any  other
South African enjoys, under the Constitution of South Africa. They can  look
forward to a very good and a very prosperous life  in  South  Africa.  Thank
you.

Mr J SCHIPPERS: Deputy Chairperson, the process  of  legislating  this  Bill
was slow and arduous. The original title of  the  Bill  was  changed  to  an
acceptable one. The public hearings and the consultation process with  focus
groups aided the portfolio committees tremendously to shape  the  Bill  into
the product it is.

The New NP is of the opinion that the Bill is  necessary,  because  we  must
fulfil our international obligations and commitments, as  contained  in  all
the conventions. South Africa is part of the global community  and  that  is
why we must adhere to those calls.

Thirteen conventions are mentioned in the Bill, and more  can  be  added  as
the years go by. I will mention only three to  show  their  importance:  The
Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on  Board  Aircraft,
signed at Tokyo on  14  September  1963;  the  Convention  on  the  Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material, adopted at Vienna on 26  October  1979;  the
International Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist  Bombings,  adopted
by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 15 December 1997.

Internally, we need an instrument like this, because, in  the  Western  Cape
especially, we have a history of terrorism.  The     instrument  will  be  a
deterrent against any person, group, or entity  who  has  the  intention  of
undermining our democracy and our Constitution.

The Bill is highly technical regarding legal terms and impressionist  idiom,
but under the able guidance of hon De Lange  and  the  state  law  advisers,
spearheaded by Dr Jacobs, the public can  rest  assured  that  a  very  high
level of excellence was attained to serve their best interest  and  that  of
the Government.

The Bill will be a good instrument in the hands of all  the  law-enforcement
agencies and the South African courts. They  will  have  a  very  clear  and
definite guideline in any legal procedure. For example, the definitions  and
interpretations, as contained in Chapter 1 of the Bill, has been  fine-tuned
to describe exactly what is meant by all the terms and phrases used  in  the
Bill.

Previously the investigating powers  and  freezing  orders  referred  to  in
Chapter 4 of the Bill were grey and woolly areas, but  the  Bill  now  gives
the investigating authority a direct  indication  how  to  deal  with  those
matters. But the most important aspect  is  that  the  Bill  is  created  to
safeguard human life  and  to  protect  our  young  democracy.  The  New  NP
supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Miss J  E  SOSIBO:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members  of
Parliament, the recent bombings  that  took  place  in  countries  like  the
United States, Thailand, Indonesia and many other countries have shown  that
peace and stability of yesterday  do  not  necessarily  translate  into  the
future safety and security of innocent citizens.

There is no country in the world that can claim immunity  from  the  threats
of terrorist activities, and South Africa is no exception.  With  this  Bill
we  are  reassuring  law-abiding  citizens  of  their  guarded  safety   and
security, while at the same time giving a stern warning to  those  who  draw
their satisfaction from the pain of human suffering.
Here at home a series  of  terror  blasts  in  the  year  2002  ravaged  the
country. Just after midnight on 30 October 2002, eight bombs rocked  Soweto.
Seven of the blasts destroyed commuter railway  lines  running  through  the
townships, inconveniencing more than 200 000  commuters.  The  eighth  blast
occurred at a  mosque,  causing  part  of  the  building  to  collapse.  The
hitherto unknown organisation, the Boeremag, claimed responsibility for  the
bombings.

Earlier on, on  30  October  2002,  The  Star  newspaper  reported  that  an
explosive device was detonated in a togbag near a  taxi  rank  at  the  Esso
Filling Station in Dlamini, and was defused  just  before  midnight  by  the
police  bomb  disposal  unit.  Soon  afterwards  the   explosions   started,
including one that went off at the Buddhist temple in Bronkhorstspruit.

These bombings brought home the  realisation  that  the  country  should  do
something, or else its international image  would  be  impaired  and  racial
relations damaged. May I remind the House that that was not the  first  time
the country had been dogged by explosions of this nature with the  resultant
loss of life and damage to infrastructure and property.

Between 1994 and  the  end  of  2000,  over  400  criminal  detonations  and
explosions  occurred  in  the  country.  They  were  caused  by   improvised
explosive devises, commercial explosions, pipe bombs,  hand  grenades,  etc.
Most of the explosions occurred in the  context  of  the  mutual-destruction
gang warfare and vigilante action against  criminal  gangs  in  the  greater
Cape Town area.

After mid-1996, the motive for  some  acts  of  violence,  in  the  form  of
bombings, drive-by shootings and assassinations, changed.  It  would  appear
that the violence was no longer  solely  committed  by  gangs  battling  for
territory and markets, or by  vigilantes  in  their  attempts  to  eliminate
suspected drug dealers.

This new violence sought to create a climate of fear  and  terror.  In  this
instance, I am sure the bombings that took place  in  popular  entertainment
areas, restaurants and tourists destinations of Cape Town  are  still  vivid
in the minds of the members in this House.

At times the violence increasingly began to target the state in the form  of
police stations, courts and the personnel of the  justice  system.  Compared
to  criminally  motivated  crime  and  violence,  these  acts  of  terrorism
mercifully had few victims.

The two dozen bomb blasts that occurred in Cape Town  between  mid-1998  and
the end of 2000 caused five fatalities, of which two involved the  suspected
bombers themselves, and about 120 injuries. The impact of terrorism  should,
however, not be measured in terms of its actual victims.

A sustained terrorist campaign can repeatedly undermine public trust in  the
state's ability to protect its  citizens.  In  democratic  states  terrorist
acts have the effect of eroding public confidence in the rule  of  law,  the
courts and the police. This detrimentally affects investors'  confidence  in
the victimised country, something a developing country such as South  Africa
can ill afford.

Terrorist acts can also have a significant impact on  tourism,  a  lucrative
industry for many developing countries. The tourist market is sensitive  and
indications  of  terrorist  activities  in  a  country   quickly   lead   to
cancellations which could have serious repercussions  for  the  economy  and
employment levels.

I hope that this brings into the fold those who have  had  misgivings  about
the need,  and  were  cautious  about  the  intentions,  of  this  piece  of
legislation. I sincerely hope that they now see things differently. This  is
the time to reassure all South Africans from all walks of life  about  their
safety and security, which is their constitutional right.

Had we failed to come up with a Bill of this nature, we  would  have  failed
in our responsibility as this Parliament  to  do  whatever  we  can  to  put
meaning to this important constitutional  principle  of  the  right  of  our
people to freedom and security and to ensure that we have an  obligation  to
see the reduction of criminal  activities  in  general,  and  terrorist  and
other related activities in particular.

Measures had to be put in place to keep a  check  on  anarchists,  like  the
ones who are responsible for this spate of bombings, and this Bill seeks  to
do exactly that. In addition, notwithstanding any provisions of  this  Bill,
any act committed during the  struggle  waged  by  people  -  including  any
action during an armed struggle  in  the  furtherance  of  their  legitimate
right  to  national  liberation,  self-determination,  or   occupation,   or
aggression, or domination by alien or foreign  forces,  in  accordance  with
the  principles  of  international   law,   especially   the   international
humanitarian law - is not considered as a terrorist activity.

For all those activities that are in contravention  of  this  proposed  law,
there will be a hell of price to pay. I know some of the  security  measures
might be an inconvenience to the law-abiding citizens. However,  the  safety
of this country and its people is worth that supposed inconvenience.  We  do
not want to leave anything to chance.

The ANC is acutely aware that it is never an easy task to  deal  effectively
with sustained terrorist threats.  The  state  has  to  expend  considerable
resources and collect evidence over frustratingly lengthy  periods  of  time
to successfully convict the kingpins in a close-knit terrorist network.

This requires excellent teamwork between the various  intelligence  and  the
law-enforcement agencies, and a motivated and specialised investigating  and
prosecuting unit devoted to identifying and convicting terrorists.  However,
just because it is difficult, we cannot fold our arms and say that there  is
nothing we can do. We are a responsible  Government.  Whenever  there  is  a
threat to the security of our citizens, this Government will  always  choose
to do something.

With these words I support the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, the  PAC  opposes  terrorism  in  all  its  forms,
including state terrorism. The PAC has experienced  state  terrorism,  which
made it possible for the PAC to be outlawed when it was only  one  year  and
one day old.

The PAC survived underground and  was  terrorised  from  8  May  1960  to  2
February 1990. Many of its leaders were sent to Robben Island  as  early  as
12 October 1960. Laws on terrorism have been abused by many  governments  to
deny  a  people  their  right  to  self-determination.  According  to   this
important principle of international law, all  peoples  have  the  right  to
self-determination. By  virtue  of  that  right  they  freely  pursue  their
economic, social and cultural development.  In  no  case  may  a  people  be
deprived of its means of subsistence. In a  democratic  society  the  ballot
must promote and enhance democracy. If it is corrupted through  the  rigging
of elections, violence, political turmoil and intimidation,  the  electorate
must take action. This may open another way for the struggle for democracy.

This in fact happened in this country after the massacre of  our  people  by
the racist colonials on 21 March 1960 in Sharpeville and Langa. It is  as  a
result of terrorism against the oppression of the  people  of  this  country
that the PAC formed  its  military  wing  Poqo,  later  called  the  Azanian
People's Liberation Army.

According to clause 14 of the Anti-Terrorism Bill the Minister  may  declare
an organisation to be a terrorist organisation in terms of the  decision  by
the Security Council of the United Nations. There are nations ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member, your time has expired.

Miss S RAJBALLY:  Thank  you,  Chairperson  and  hon  Ministers.  This  Bill
appears to clarify a number of terrorist definitions that could impede  upon
the citizen's democratic rights deemed by our Constitution as lawful.

The Minority Front shares the international concern  about  terrorism,  that
is, to find the need to have an international definition of  terrorism,  the
act of terrorism and  activities  associated  with  it.  This  would  enable
proper legislation and the curtailing of the matter.

The MF supports the  clarity  that  this  Bill  aims  to  provide,  and  the
democracy it protects in doing so. We find the financing of terrorism to  be
a different crime, punishable by law  for  supporting  and  motivating  such
criminal activities that often cost the lives of many. It is  necessary  for
September 11 to be mentioned as a matter of recent concern in our own  South
Africa.

The MF denounces all terrorist acts  and  supports  the  department  in  its
efforts to  protect  our  country  from  such  violence,  and  applauds  the
noninterference  of  the  right  of  our  people,  especially   our   Muslim
community. The MF supports the protection of  the  constitutional  democracy
against terrorism and related activities. Thank you, Chairperson.
Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Hon members, much of the concern  around  the  original
Bill as tabled were raised by Muslim organisations.  Given  the  experiences
of Muslims in countries like the United States and  Britain  in  these  last
few years, these fears are perfectly understandable.

The countries that claim the copyright and monopoly  of  democratic  thought
are the very ones who display the most vicious form of vilification  against
Muslims or anyone who fits the stereotype. The despicable approach by  these
and other countries against the legitimate  aspirations  of  the  people  of
Palestine, the baseless invasion of  countries  like  Iraq,  the  threat  of
further such invasions in the name of global terror, and  the  use  of  such
dramatic notions as the Axis of Evil, together connote to Muslims  all  over
the world a total  onslaught  not  just  on  their  liberties,  but  on  the
practice of Islam itself.

Islam rests on five main pillars of which the giving of alms to the poor  or
zakaat is sacred. Ordinary Muslims throughout the world  engage  in  funding
charitable organisations whether they are based locally or  internationally.
In this country, and on the continent, much good work  gets  done  by  these
organisations.

In  Britain  and  other  so-called  democracies   such   Muslim   charitable
organisations have either been banned, investigated or  generally  harassed.
These matters are  not  insignificant  to  the  Muslim  community  in  South
Africa. It  is  therefore  entirely  understandable  that  ordinary  Muslims
reacted adversely to the tabling of the Anti-Terrorism Bill as it  was  then
called. And I daresay, their concerns were  well-founded.  Together  with  a
very loose and wide  definition  of  a  terrorist  act,  terrorism  was  not
defined. It seemed as if the original drafters had  come  undone  when  they
began grappling with the concept of terrorism.  It  is  of  course  no  easy
task. After all, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.  This
approach, however, suggests that the question  of  who  is  a  terrorist  is
entirely a subjective one. In other words what appears to  be  a  terrorist,
must be a terrorist. Not a very comforting  proposition  for  South  African
Muslims who have seen blatant stereotyping  stripping  ordinary  law-abiding
citizens of their liberty, dignity and even their jobs in the  aftermath  of
September 11 in that bastion of civil rights, the great US of A.

These and other complaints were tabled at the public hearing stage  of  this
Bill, resulting in a much-altered piece of legislation  more  in  tune  with
the protection of a constitutional democracy.

The Bill now, through the criminalising of very specific acts, defines  more
closely our idea of what terrorism is, but more importantly what it isn't.

Legitimate struggles for liberation akin to our own in this country are  set
apart and are not regarded as terrorist activitiy. A more  direct  reference
to the struggle of the  Palestinian  peoples  you  could  not  find  in  any
domestic legislation.

In defining terrorist activity, what constitutes such acts  is  specifically
stated. All the elements are spelled out in each of the crimes  as  well  as
the stringent legal tests to be applied.

Funding a terrorist organisation is a crime in terms of this Bill, but  this
crime is very specifically drafted. Again, to fall foul of  this  provision,
there would have to be an intention to finance  an  entity  engaged  in  the
outlawed activity. The ordinary Muslim or family paying zakaat into  a  fund
established ostensibly, but not really, for charitable  purposes  would  not
fall foul of this provision as long as there was no knowledge  or  intention
to fund murderous acts or organisations.

Much has been said about the contents and the provisions of this  Bill,  and
I just want to take this opportunity, in the last few minutes that  I  have,
to say to fellow Muslims and indeed to  all  those  who  cherish  democratic
liberties that it is the unwise who point to this Bill as a reason  to  feel
disaffected.

One only needs to take the time and trouble to read it  and  understand  its
provisions, to see that this Bill is targeted at threats to  our  collective
security and wellbeing.

One only need remember that the essence of this democracy is built  on,  and
at the very heart of this Government lies, the conviction that South  Africa
belongs to all who live in it. All, hon members, all who live in  it.  Thank
you, very much. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Chair, particularly  since  11  September,  supporting  the
fight against terrorism both domestically  and  internationally  has  become
like being in favour of motherhood and apple pie - it puts you on  the  side
of  the   angels.   Therefore,   particularly   because   of   international
developments and new imperatives in terms of South Africa's  obligations  to
the United Nations, the DA supports  in  principle  the  need  for  domestic
legislation to combat terrorism.

The challenge for the joint committee, which  has  worked  on  and  produced
this Bill, has been to draft an instrument which will enable our  Government
to combat terrorism and fulfil its international obligations, but which,  at
the same time, complies with the Constitution and, more  particularly,  does
not infringe  on  the  protection  it  affords  to  human  rights  of  every
individual as well as the freedoms  that  are  guaranteed  in  our  Bill  of
Rights.

The DA believes that what has been placed before this Parliament today  does
achieve these goals, and for  that  reason  we  support  the  Bill.  In  the
committee, the DA adopted a two-pronged approach. While  my  colleague,  the
hon Paul Swart of the safety and security committee, kept  a  beady  eye  on
the effectiveness of the antiterror provisions, my brief  from  the  justice
portfolio committee was to keep a watch on protecting human rights.

To be effective against terror, but, at  the  same  time,  to  preserve  and
conserve the delicate plant of constitutional values,  such  as  freedom  of
speech, freedom of the media and due  process  of  law,  is  no  easy  task.
History is littered with failures. However, I'm satisfied on this account.

This legislation, which had been  mooted  for  some  time  even  before  the
events of 11 September 2001 - although those shattering events caused it  to
return to the priority list - has had a long gestation and a  difficult  and
controversial birth. The original draft Bill, which surfaced in response  to
the Pagad bombings some years ago, contained echoes  of  past  human  rights
abuses such as detention without trial. It was then referred to the  SA  Law
Commission team, led by the  current  President  of  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal, Judge Craig Howie, for fixing, and many months later  they  came  up
with a much better draft.

However, something funny happened to the Bill on the way  to  the  forum  of
Parliament.  Again,  redrafted,  apparently  by  SAPS  officials,  the  Bill
initially tabled in Parliament and presented to the joint committee  was  an
abortion. The definition of terrorism covered almost  any  crime,  and  such
innocuous acts as sending a food parcel to the Palestinians could have  been
deemed a terrorist act.

As my colleague the hon Paul Swart has indicated, that  Cabinet  could  have
passed such a Bill and that  Parliament  and  the  scores  of  organisations
which made outraged submissions on this shocking  draft,  should  have  been
made to waste a large amount of time and  effort,  giving  consideration  to
this dreadful piece of work, is one of the puzzles of  this  five-year  term
of Parliament.

One of the unfortunate consequences of this is that the  Bill  still  has  a
bad name amongst significant communities in our country. Not a day  goes  by
that I do not receive an e-mail from some Muslim or freedom-of-speech  group
lobbying me to reject the Bill. Hopefully, the hon Imam Solomon and the  hon
Chohan-Khota have allayed some of their fears.

What we need to get across is that this antiterrorism Bill  is  an  entirely
different animal. It's been completely redrafted by people with a  sense  of
our constitutional values and with the goal of ensuring  that  human  rights
are protected. The offensive clauses of the previous draft have gone.  Thank
you, Chairperson. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, in The ANC Today,  Volume  1,  Number  34,  our
President writes:


  The memory is still fresh in our minds of the hundreds  of  Africans  who
  died when the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were attacked by  people
  who have clearly identified the US government as their enemy. ... none of
  these Africans could ever be accused of having been involved in  planning
  or conducting acts of war. They died because those who killed  them  have
  little or no regard for human life.

Our President goes on to say, and I quote:


  Whatever their cause, those  responsible  for  these  mass  murders  have
  demeaned that cause and placed themselves in a  position  in  which  they
  cannot  be  accepted  as  people  who  should  be  treated   as   genuine
  representatives of a just cause. Regardless of that cause and its  future
  outcome, it can never be said that the  end  they  pursue  justifies  the
  means they have used.

Later, in that particular letter, he goes on to say:


  There have been some in our country who correctly opposed and  spoke  out
  against the phenomenon of gangsterism and drugs. Again, there can  be  no
  doubt that this phenomenon corrodes the very fabric of  our  society  and
  condemns thousands of people to a life of misery.  All  of  us  therefore
  have an obligation to fight and defeat the gangsters and to wipe out  the
  trade in narcotics.


  However, we do not and will not accept that because the struggle  against
  gangsters and drug abuse is correct  and  just,  it  is  permissible  for
  anybody to resort to a campaign of bombs and assassination. The  argument
  cannot be defended that the end justifies the means.

It is against this background and within the context of these words  by  our
President that we deliberate on the Protection of  Constitutional  Democracy
Against Terrorist and Related Activities Bill.

As has already been stated by previous speakers,  much  criticism  has  been
levelled against the very notion of a Bill that seeks to combat  or  prevent
terrorism. One of these criticisms refers to the fact that South  Africa  is
merely putting into legislation a Bill that is similar to  President  Bush's
Patriot Act. Now it is important  that  we  dispel  any  notion  that  South
Africa is being dictated to by the USA or anybody else.

The African Union and the United Nations have  conventions  to  which  South
Africa  is  a  signatory.  Many  of  these  conventions   are   multilateral
agreements  which  deal  with  terrorism.  More  importantly,  however,   in
response to the criticism that we are being dictated to by  the  USA,  South
Africa acceded to many of these conventions long before the horrible  events
of 9/11. I urge hon members and other people to familiarise themselves  with
these conventions, which are listed in the preamble to the Bill.

An important mechanism in  combating  and  preventing  terrorist  activities
emanates from  the  International  Convention  on  the  Suppression  of  the
Financing of Terrorism, which was adopted  by  the  United  Nations  General
Assembly on 9 December 1999, and later  ratified  by  South  Africa  in  May
2003. Although South Africa  only  ratified  this  convention  earlier  this
year, this  Parliament  had  already  approved  the  Financial  Intelligence
Centre Act, which, amongst other things, seeks to focus on  money-laundering
activities by organised crime syndicates by placing an  onus  on   financial
institutions to report suspicious and unusual financial  transactions.  This
Act has now been amended by the Bill before us to include the  financing  of
terrorist and related activities.

Another important Act of Parliament, which has  been  amended  by  the  Bill
before us, is the Prevention of  Organised  Crime  Act  -  particularly  the
provision which allows our law-enforcement agencies to apply for  the  civil
forfeiture of the assets and property of crime  syndicates.  The  Prevention
of Organised Crime Act has now been amended to allow for the  forfeiture  of
assets or property, which are concerned  with  the  commission  of  offences
that are associated with terrorist and related activities.

These amendments are  welcomed  because  they  strike  a  blow  against  the
financing  of  terrorism.  Several  speakers  have  also  referred  to   the
constitutionality  of  this  Bill  and  the  very  important  human   rights
enshrined in our Constitution. As sacrosanct as  our  rights  are  to  human
dignity, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and  movement,  etc,  so
too are our rights to personal  security  and  in  particular  the  need  to
ensure our freedom from any terrorist threat.

Section 198 of our Constitution sets out the  governing  principle  for  all
South Africa's security services,  particularly  the  fact  that  all  South
Africans must live in peace and harmony to be free from fear and  want,  and
this precludes any South African citizen from  participating  in  any  armed
conflict domestically and internationally. This Bill seeks  to  address  the
principles contained in section 198 of our Constitution and  this  too  must
be welcomed.

For these reasons and the reasons put  forward  by  speakers  before  me,  I
commend this Bill to this honourable House. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson, hon members,  I  am
grateful for the support which the Bill appears to enjoy from all  sides  of
the House. One might almost say that there  is  unanimous  support  for  the
Bill,  which  reminds  me  that  I  should  paraphrase  Winston  Churchill's
warning, that whenever the House of Commons is unanimous,  the  decision  is
usually wrong. [Interjection.]

Of course, recently we experienced that the British cabinet passed a Bill  -
it was passed by the House of Commons - on terrorism and was thrown  out  by
the House of Lords. That's  very  recent.  In  other  words,  there  are  no
infallible  institutions.  The  price   of   liberty   is   vigilance   ....
[Interjections.] ... You have to be vigilant. I beg  you  pardon?  I  didn't
hear that.

I think that the vigilance of the House and  of  members  of  the  portfolio
committee is something we should all be happy about and it should also be  a
characteristic  of  this  House.  As  I  say,  there   are   no   infallible
institutions and, therefore, this House also is not infallible. We will  see
during implementation whether the Bill that we  are  so  enthusiastic  about
will actually work. We don't know yet.

In many other countries they have excellent legislation and  the  experience
was very different. The Germans found out, when they were dealing  with  the
Baader-Meinhof Gang, that their  wonderful  laws  and  constitutions  didn't
really help them for very many years. So we must also watch out because  the
law is an instrument. It also  depends  for  its  effectiveness  on  how  we
respond to some very unusual activities by terrorists and others.

No one could have anticipated the attack of September 11,  planned  by  some
men in a cave in Afghanistan, and which has  given  shock  to  the  greatest
power in the world today.  So  we  must  also  prepare  ourselves  for  some
shocks, and those shocks will determine whether or not the legislation  that
we are passing is effective. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

 NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL AND NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
                        MANAGEMENT: BIODIVERSITY BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, it gives  me
great pleasure to place before this House two pieces  of  legislation  that,
once passed, will usher in  a  new  code  of  environmental  protection  and
management in the country. It  will  ensure,  for  the  first  time  in  the
country's history, that management is truly done for the people  by  working
together with the people.

I place before you the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity  Bill
as well as the National Environmental Management Amendment Bill.

Firstly, let me place these two Bills  in  the  context  of  the  advent  of
democracy in this country. The environmental rights  of  the  individual  in
our Constitution require that Government put mechanisms in place  to  ensure
a healthy and decent environment, conducive to  the  wellbeing  of  all,  to
have  the  environment  protected  and  to  promote  ecological  sustainable
development and the use of natural  resources  while  promoting  justifiable
economic and social development.

The  passing  of  specific  sectoral  legislation  gives  impetus   to   the
achievement of our goals as set out in the  Constitution.  These  two  Bills
take our country to the next step of our  law  reform  programme.  You  will
recall that in 1998 we passed  the  National  Environmental  Management  Act
which lays the foundation for environmental management in this country.

This was a vision that we gave ourselves as a country and  indeed  a  vision
the world adopted at the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development.  We  are
aware too that our work on environmental management  will  only  succeed  in
sustainably  changing  the  lives  of  our  people  if  it  is  informed  by
Government's overall vision  of  ensuring  a  better  life  for  all.  These
legislative tools that are placed before the House today play a  significant
role towards the attainment of that national goal.

The Biodiversity Bill finally  replaces  the  apartheid  framework  for  our
national parks as was set out in the National Parks Act of 1976. It  ensures
that  South  Africa  has  a  single  legislative  framework  governing   the
management and conservation of the country's precious biological resources.

The Bill further recognises and institutionalises efforts by our people  who
have for many centuries  applied  conservation  measures.  It  ensures  that
Government and the people work in partnership in  achieving  the  objectives
of our democracy through conservation of our biological resources.

It is  a  well-known  fact  that  South  Africa  ranks  as  the  third  most
biologically diverse country in the world and it is our  constitutional  and
moral responsibility to jealously guard our  gift  from  nature  and  ensure
that it contributes to the upliftment of our nation.

For many years the planning of development did not take adequate  cognisance
of our biodiversity heritage, thereby leading to developments that were  not
in  harmony  with  the  environment  but  rather  threatening  environmental
sustainability.

The Bill provides for an integrated, co-ordinated and  uniform  approach  to
biodiversity  management   through   the   establishment   of   a   national
biodiversity framework. This in turn creates  the  context  for  bioregional
plans which protect unique biomes, such as the Cape  floristic  kingdom  and
other biomes across the country.
The Bill recognises that the time has long  passed  where  Government  alone
can take responsibility for the conservation of  biodiversity  and  as  such
has made provision for the highly valued and  crucial  community  input  and
participation in biodiversity conservation  planning,  marking  yet  another
step  forward  in  Government's  efforts  to   ensure   that   environmental
protection  and  management  are  people-owned,  giving  added  impetus   to
Government's efforts to ensure conservation by the people for the people.

The Bill also makes provision for the  private  sector  to  become  actively
involved in the development of biodiversity management plans for  particular
ecosystems and species. In this way, the  person  in  the  street  can  also
become involved in the protection of  sensitive  ecosystems  and  endangered
species.

The threat to biodiverstity by the introduction of  alien  invasive  species
has been one of the biggest  problems  that  our  environment  faces.  Large
areas of land have been invaded by alien plant species  which  compete  with
indigenous vegetation for scarce water and other resources.

Similarly, alien animal species have invaded natural vegetation and  in  the
absence of natural enemies are destroying the natural habitat of  indigenous
species, thereby displacing our valued indigenous biodiversity.

The good news is that this Bill endeavours to address this threat  by  means
of  instituting  a  permit  system,  based  on  the  conservation   of   the
environment, for the importation of alien species. The  Bill  envisages  the
establishment of both national and provincial lists  of  evasive  and  alien
species which would require permits and also species which, owing  to  their
aggressive invasiveness, may not be allowed at  all  into  the  Republic  of
South Africa.

An area of great concern to the  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Tourism  is  the  apparent  lack  of  co-ordination  between  the  different
legislative instruments currently being applied in the country.

An alien species is allowed into the country by virtue of  a  permit  issued
by one or other province, although the application  may  have  already  been
turned down by another province. The  import  is  achieved  by  means  of  a
practice which we refer to as province-hopping. This may result in  some  of
the species having a detrimental impact on biodiversity in the country as  a
result of the unco-ordinated implementation of legislation and policy.

Again it pleases me to announce before this House that, for the first  time,
South Africans can now be assured that a species that is not allowed in  the
country  will  not  legally  be  imported  as  a  result  of  unco-ordinated
implementation of legislation.

The  import  and  control  of  genetically   modified   organisms   is   the
responsibility of the Department  of  Agriculture  through  the  Genetically
Modified Organisms Act of 1997, in which  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs plays an important role as a member of the GMO council,  established
in terms of that Act.

The dangers associated with GMOs have been  a  concern  of  members  of  the
portfolio committee for a very long time. So, together with  my  department,
this matter has been receiving  attention.  The  monitoring  powers  of  the
department are now strengthened by linking the GMO  application  process  in
terms of the GMO Act with  the  National  Environmental  Management  Act  in
instances where it is felt that  the  environment  could  be  impacted  upon
negatively.

By linking the two legal instruments, the department  now  has  a  lever  to
require  an  environmental  impact  assessment  in   specific   cases.   The
biodiversity of the country and the knowledge of the  indigenous  people  on
the benefits that can be derived from the ingredients of  natural  resources
makes it an ideal place for research and bioprospecting  for  medicinal  and
other purposes.

Much concern was expressed about the selling of the  country's  biodiversity
heritage and genetic  material  through  the  National  Botanical  Institute
agreement. This Bill seeks to address these concerns.

The Bill provides for the protection of the rights of communities  who,  for
so long, did not have the benefit of legal protection of  the  rights  based
on providing access to biological resources  and  supplying  of  information
that can direct research and development.

Yet another effort is to ensure that  our  people  are  empowered  and  will
directly  benefit  from  the  provision  of  valuable  knowledge.  The  Bill
establishes  legal  instruments  such  as  benefit  sharing  agreements  and
material  transfer  agreements  that  will  ensure  that  people   providing
information or resources will be  compensated  should  the  developments  of
such resources prove to be effective. This  will  be  done  by  taking  into
account that not all benefits  will  be  of  monetary  value,  as  the  fair
sharing of these benefits is also catered for.

As my time is running out, may I just point out,  in  conclusion,  that  the
Bill also  establishes,  for  the  first  time,  a  South  African  National
Biodiversity  Institute  which  will  transform   the   National   Botanical
Institute from one of only concentrating on botany to one  concentrating  on
biodiversity and ecosystems as a whole.

The amendment Bill, which is also before us, does a number  of  things,  but
one of the most important is that it gives teeth to the  department  as  far
as the establishment of an inspectorate is concerned and as far as  ensuring
that proper monitoring and effective action can be  taken  in  instances  of
wrongdoing as far as the environment is concerned.

I would like to thank the members of the portfolio  committee  for  all  the
support and the tremendous amount of tireless work that has gone  into  both
guiding the department in terms of policy making  in  regard  to  these  two
Bills, and in the  meticulous  way  in  which  these  two  Bills  have  been
processed and of the valuable additions that were made. [Applause.]

Ms G L  MAHLANGU-NKABINDE:  Ngiyabonga  mhlali  nga  phambili.  [Thank  you,
Chairperson.]

Indeed South Africa's richness  in  biodiversity  is  recognised,  not  only
nationally but internationally as well. Don't we  all  know  and  appreciate
the contribution that this national heritage has made and continues to  make
to the economy of our country, whether in tourism or trade.

Allow me to refer to the White Paper on Biodiversity  Conservation  and  the
Sustainable use of Biological Resources, which was published  in  1997.  The
fragmented,  polarised  and  inefficient  administrative   and   legislative
structures created by apartheid resulted in  no  fewer  than  17  government
departments having primarily the  responsibility  for  nature  conservation,
prior to the 1994 elections.

This situation did not improve with the establishment of new  provinces  and
government  structures.  Divided   responsibilities,   together   with   the
duplication of effort and profusion of laws, and most importantly a lack  of
co-ordination, has been a major factor hampering the effective  conservation
of  biodiversity.  Biodiversity  management  cuts  across  all  spheres   of
Government and it is  a  multisectoral  or  cross-sectoral  issue.  It  lies
within the ambit of the different national departments, at  both  provincial
and local levels. In all  these  spheres  and  sectors,  legislation  exists
which  seeks  to  regulate  the  different   aspects   of   South   Africa's
biodiversity.

South  Africa  is  also  a  signatory  to  a  number  of  multilateral   and
environmental agreements, be they international  conventions,  original  and
international protocols, which are  binding  and  therefore  national  legal
frameworks for their implementation has to  be  put  in  place.  Aspects  of
biodiversity management  include  conservation,  trade,  access  to  genetic
resources, bioprospecting and a fairly new notion of benefit sharing.
Trade alone happens at both domestic and international level and  both  with
species in abundance, but unfortunately with those that are under some  sort
of threat and  therefore  need  protection.  Conservation  as  well  happens
within the confines of  parks  or  protected  areas  as  they  are  commonly
referred to, natural ecosystems and other enclosures,  like  zoological  and
botanical gardens, as well as sanctuaries.

To enforce, therefore, such a range of aspects of management  with  existing
regulatory systems spending across all levels of Government, which  involves
a plethora of provincial ordinances and national pieces of legislation,  has
proved to be ineffective.

Recognising  the  fragmentation  as  already  stated,  which  was  not  only
peculiar to biodiversity or the environment per se,  you  will  recall  that
soon after the heroic transition to democracy in  1994  the  new  democratic
Government embarked on an extensive policy and  legal  reform  programme  as
steps in eradicating apartheid, while reconstructing  and  transforming  the
sociopolitical and economic setting in the country.

Amongst other  things,  this  has  triggered  a  thorough  and  consultative
environmental law reform process, which started with the publication of  the
White Paper on Environmental Management Policy for South Africa in 1998,  to
which I referred earlier.

As a first step in giving effect to  this  policy,  Parliament  enacted  the
flagship National and Environmental Management Act, commonly referred to  as
Nema, in 1998. This  Act  is  an  overarching  framework  for  environmental
management as is evident in the name of the Act itself.  Overarching  as  it
is, it necessitates the development of sectoral pieces under  it  and  those
that are relevant to conservation  and  to  the  sustainable  use  of  South
Africa's biological resources, such as protected  areas,  which  this  House
deliberated and voted upon on 16 September 2003.

This Bill, the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Bill which  is
in  front  of  us  today,  does  not  directly  repeal  existing  provincial
ordinances and other relevant laws. It provides  for  the  consolidation  of
many different pieces of biodiversity legislation, particularly with  regard
to  aspects  of  co-ordination  of   international   obligations   and   the
distribution of benefits  derived  from  indigenious  biological  resources.
Many provincial pieces of legislation are  already  being  rationalised  and
aligned with Nema.

The biodiversity Bill will, among other things, enable the Government to  do
the  following:  To  establish  an  integrated,  co-ordinated  planning  and
monitoring regime,  whose  key  components  will  be  the  specification  of
bioregions; the preparation and review of  bioregional  conservation  plans;
as well as the approval, publishing and review  of  biodiversity  management
plans.

In implementing provisions on  planning,  the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism  will  develop  a  national  biodiversity  strategy  and
action plan which will  seek  to  mainstream  biodiversity  management  with
planning and development imperatives  and  which  would  link  up  with  the
integrated sustainable rural development strategy.

This legislation also mandates the Minister to report to Parliament -  which
I know he likes very much - on the status of biodiversity in  South  Africa.
Regulation  of  alien  and  invasive  species  in  a  genetically   modified
organism, as well as trade  in  protected  species,  is  contained  in  this
legislation. My colleagues will elaborate on some of these matters.

Of particular importance, which is currently not regulated in any sector  or
sphere of Government, is bioprospecting of indigenous  biological  resources
and regulation of benefits that arise from  the  commercial  utilisation  of
our resources, which this legislation will do.

The drafting of this and other sectoral pieces of  legislation  necessitated
the amendment of  Nema,  which  I  have  already  indicated  is  overarching
legislation. It is for this reason that the Nema Amendment  Bill  is  tabled
before you today. These amendments are required  in  order  to  ensure  that
Nema  provides  the  necessary  supporting  legal  framework  for  this  new
legislation.

The  amendment  rationalises  and   streamlines   the   administration   and
enforcement provisions in Nema and is also aimed at addressing the  previous
lack of effective enforcement and implementation of environmental laws.  The
primary  advantage  of  these  amendments  is  that  provincial  and   local
government  staff  of  those  departments   responsible   for   biodiversity
management may be  designated  as  environmental  management  inspectors  to
enforce the provisions of national and environmental management  legislation
- for any legislation is  as  good  as  nonexistent  without  the  necessary
enforcement mechanisims.

In conclusion, as we look back over 10 years of democracy in  our  land  and
take stock of our achievements and  the  lessons  we  have  learnt,  we  are
planning for the future by a marked beginning of a new era  in  biodiversity
management with the passing these two Bills. We support these two Bills.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, there are more than 12 000 plants and  animals
threatened with extinction, said the IUCN recently, and this is 1  000  more
than last year. It is also more than the number of new  species  identified.
We are on a downward spiral and the Bill before us today is the response  to
this looming crisis.

Is human technology destroying biodiversity? While  the  IFP  wholeheartedly
endorses the Environmental Management Act, we  have  serious  concerns  with
the biodiversity Bill and we give it only qualified support.  To  understand
our concerns we need to get clear on a few definitions.  The  first  is  the
definition of  ``biotechnology'',  which  is  the  use  of  life  forms  and
technology and there are thousands of these.

The second is ``biodiversity'', which refers to the variety of  life  forms.
It is the variety that enables life forms to respond to stress and  continue
to evolve. ``Ecology'' is in fact the flow  of  energy  through  living  and
nonliving matter towards a state of balance. In this respect our bodies  are
no different from our earth. If we lack water, we thirst  and  if  we  drink
water we achieve balance. If we do not get the water, we die.

While we are mere trivial microscopic specks in the macrocosm, it is we  who
must prevent technology from fouling up the magnificent work of  nature.  If
the legislation we adopt today does not do this, then our  support  for  the
Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol and the WSSD  are
mere words and empty promises.

``Modern biotechnology'' refers usually to the use  of  genes  regulated  by
the Genetically Modified Organisms Act, or GMO Act. In this field we have  a
far greater capacity to destroy than to create. The IFP supports that  South
Africa is becoming a biotechnology hub. We have a rich source of  indigenous
knowledge in plants and herbs and to have a vigorous biotechnology  industry
it must be safe and  transparent,  protect  the  interests  of  people  with
indigenous knowledge and protect the public from harm.  We  do  not  believe
that the GMO Act or  the  biodiversity  Bill  which  is  based  on  it  will
necessarily protect the public from GM harm.

Food production is only one aspect of biotechnology and should  not  advance
at the expense of all others.  I  have  here  a  document  produced  by  the
international food policy research institute. In it there is  a  summary  of
the pros and cons for GM foods. The pros are mainly related to  the  product
in the short term and the cons can be devastating  to  biodiversity  and  to
health. The dangers, in fact, are long-term and irreversible.

Our GMO Act and biodiversity Bill will not  protect  us  from  harm  because
they do not introduce mandatory controls. All  activities  needed  to  check
GMOs, their side-effects and their field trials may be requested if the  GMO
council or the environmental Minister deems that necessary.

They may request risk assessments, field trials or EIAs. All GMO  activities
require a permit, and that is fine, but according  to  Nema  all  activities
requiring a permit require environmental impact assessment. It  sounds  good
but it has already been established that the GMO Act  does  not  necessarily
allow  for  transparency  or  always   require   an   environmental   impact
assessment.

Two hundred permits have been issued for GMO activities. All have  had  risk
assessments and field  trials  done  which,  in  most  cases,  is  paperwork
submitted by companies looking for the permits. If planting is  involved  it
may be in a local area with  local  effects,  but  no  environmental  impact
assessment assesses the harm which may  cause  irreversible  damage  to  the
environment.

We already have three commercial products on the market: cotton,  maize  and
ready round-up, but no environmental impact assessment has been done on  the
effects of those. Recently, following  trials  in  Britain,  two  GM  crops,
namely oilseed rape and sugarbeet, face a Eurowide ban  after  field  trials
showed that they reduced butterfly, bird and bee populations.
Other trials have shown that GM crops can produce  super  weeds.  Therefore,
as I say, hon Minister, we give qualified  support  for  this  Bill  in  the
knowledge that the chairperson and the hon Minister have a  genuine  concern
for the environment and that the Bill must align with the GMO Act, but  this
Act must come up for review. We are strongly opposed to the  casual  way  in
which it handles GMOs and the lack of transparency attached to that Act.  We
propose that no permits should be issued unless  there  are  mandatory  risk
assessments, field trials and EIAs. An unimpeded transparency as to who  has
applied for or has been given permits to do what and  where  should  prevail
so that the committee can follow the implications. We also call for a  paper
trail in future from seed to stomach so that,  if  accidents  do  occur,  we
know how to rectify them.

Mr J D ARENDSE: Chairperson, hon members and hon Minister, South  Africa  is
a signatory to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and to the Convention  on
Biological  Diversity.  Today  the  convention  is  the  main  international
instrument for addressing biodiversity  issues.  Biosafety  is  one  of  the
issues addressed by the convention.

This concept refers to the need to protect human health and the  environment
from the possible diverse effects of products of modern  biotechnology.  Our
beloved country being a party to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety and  to
the Convention on Biological Diversity, it has to  take  the  necessary  and
appropriate legal administrative and other  related  measures  to  implement
and honour its obligations in terms of this protocol.

During the portfolio committee deliberations on the  National  Environmental
Management Biodiversity  Bill  the  committee  was  of  the  view  that  the
Genetically Modified Organisms Act, Act 15 of 1997, commonly called the  GMO
Act, does not adequately deal with the obligations as  clearly  outlined  in
the Cartagena Protocol.

The committee, therefore, found it necessary that the  shortcomings  of  the
GMO Act be addressed in this Bill and thus section  76(a)  was  included  in
the Bill, which we believe adequately  deals  with  and  complies  with  the
country's obligations in terms of the Cartagena Protocol.

Section 76(a) of the Bill empowers our Minister to recommend to the  permit-
issuing authority not to issue a permit for the release,  whether  trial  or
general, of a genetically modified organism into the environment  if  it  is
suspected  that  it  poses  a  threat  to  any  indigenous  species  or  the
environment,  unless  and  until  an  environmental  assessment   has   been
conducted in accordance with the stipulations of the Act when this  Bill  is
enacted.

Again, hon members, in adherence with the  principles  of  good  governance,
the Minister is requested to submit such beliefs as alluded to above to  the
authority issuing such permits in terms of the GMO Act  of  1997,  before  a
decision is made regarding the approval of the application of  the  relevant
permit.

It is, therefore, our firm  belief  that  section  76(a)  ensures  that  our
country, as one of the  original  signatories  to  the  Cartagena  Protocol,
adheres to the spirit and letter of the protocol, in so far  as  genetically
modified organisms are concerned.

Hon members, in order to fully address  our  obligations  in  terms  of  the
protocol,  this  Bill  proposes  the  establishment  of  the   SA   National
Biodiversity Institute which will, amongst other things, monitor the  status
of the Republic's biodiversity, conservation, and the status of  all  listed
or protected species and listed ecosystems, as well as  the  status  of  all
listed and invasive species, and will report on all such to our Minister.

Of paramount importance is that this institute again will,  on  the  request
of  the  Minister,  report  on  the  impasse  of  any  genetically  modified
organisms that have been released into  the  environment  inclusive  of  the
impact  on  nontarget  organisms  and   ecological   processes,   indigenous
biological resources and the biodiversity of species used for agriculture.

The institute is also expected to assist the Minister in the performance  of
his or her duties and also the exercise of powers assigned to  the  Minister
in terms of this Bill. It  will  also  advise  him  or  her  on  any  matter
regulated  in  terms  of  this  Bill  inclusive  of   the   management   and
conservation of biological  diversity  and  sustainable  use  of  indigenous
biological resources.

Hon members, this Bill proposes the establishment of  this  institute  as  a
juristic person and as such the general  powers  which  will  influence  and
enable the effective and efficient running of the institute  and  fulfilment
of its expectations and requirements.

The institute will be governed by a board of not less  than  seven  but  not
more than nine members, depending on the  decisions  by  the  Minister.  The
Bill  dictates  that  members  of  the   board   should   have   appropriate
qualifications - and experience of course - in  the  field  of  biodiversity
and, therefore, members of Parliament and  of  provincial  legislatures  and
municipal councils unfortunately cannot become members of this board.

In  line  with  the  principles  of  transparency  and  accountability,  the
appointment of members of the board of the institute will be  advertised  in
the media circulating nationally and in each province in  which  nominations
will be invited by the Minister in terms of section 15 of the Bill.

This Bill also proposes that the Minister should appoint  a  member  of  the
board  as  the  chairperson.  He  or  she  will  also  be  responsible   for
determination of the conditions of employment of members of  the  board.  As
in all institutions of this nature, accountability is one  of  the  criteria
requested and expected of people placed in such responsible positions.  Thus
section 15 outlines the conduct of members of the board.

Now there is much more to be said about this  institution,  but  I  think  I
have adequately dealt with what this institution  is  supposed  to  do.  The
Freedom Charter states that South Africa belongs to  all  who  live  in  it.
With this Bill the ANC ensures that the environment will be enjoyed  by  all
who live in South Africa for many generations to come.[Applause.]

Mr E K MOORCROFT: Chairperson, I don't think one would  be  exaggerating  if
one were to say that this Bill is one of the most important  Bills  ever  to
have been presented to  the  portfolio  committee  by  the  department.  The
reason for this is because it  is  aimed  at  protecting  one  of  our  most
valuable assets, which is our unsurpassed wealth  of  biological  diversity.
Indeed,  we  are  recognised  internationally  as  being  one  of  the  most
biologically diverse countries on earth.

The benefits of this rich heritage of ours  are  legion.  One  of  the  most
obvious benefits is to the tourist industry. Tourists come  to  our  country
from far and wide in order to admire our magnificent flora and  fauna.  This
includes  not  only  the  much-vaunted  big  five,  but  also  the   largest
concentration of bird species outside the Amazon basin and one of  only  six
floral kingdoms in the world.

If we destroy this heritage, we will not  only  be  impoverishing  ourselves
and thereby proving ourselves unworthy and irresponsible custodians, but  we
will also be destroying an asset which gives us the opportunity to  exploit,
for great profit and in a sustainable way, the natural bounty with which  we
have been so amply blessed.

The greatest cause of loss of biological diversity  is  the  destruction  of
natural habitats by human intervention. For this reason, there has  been  an
ongoing attempt to create  protected  areas  which  maintain  representative
reservoirs of biological  diversity  in  areas  threatened  by  development.
However, these storehouses of biological  diversity,  praiseworthy  as  they
might be, are insufficient in themselves,  particularly  so  if  they  exist
merely as islands of biological diversity to protect the diversity in a  sea
of biological destruction.

Furthermore, there  is  great  cause  for  concern  because  many  areas  of
irreplaceable biological diversity, which are seriously threatened,  do  not
as yet enjoy protection. These threatened unprotected areas  have  increased
dramatically  over  the  past  20  years  as  human  intervention  continues
unrestricted and biological diversity continues to pay the price.

Many of the protected areas in our country ignore  natural  lifelines  drawn
through river basins, migratory corridors and fertile ocean  currents.  This
often has serious consequences for biodiversity. The funds for  conservation
are always in short supply, and I am sure the hon Minister will  agree  with
that. What this all adds up to is a closing window  of  opportunity.  If  we
fail to act now, we will miss our last chance to protect  our  rich  natural
heritage for the benefit of future generations.

The  Bill  before  us  seeks  to  supplement  the  very  important  function
currently being carried out by our protected areas  programme,  by  covering
the  entire  land  and  sea  area  of  our  country  over  which   we   have
jurisdiction. This is a most commendable  initiative,  and  the  DA  has  no
hesitation in giving its enthusiastic support to the Bill before us.

In the remaining time allotted to me, I should like to address  one  or  two
aspects of the Bill which caused the committee  a  degree  of  concern.  The
first  of  these,  as  we  have  heard  from   the   hon   Rabinowitz   who,
unfortunately, had to leave early, is the  problem  of  how  to  handle  so-
called genetic engineering. In a critique of the Bill published in the  Mail
and Guardian in February 2003, it was stated that:


  Even more distressing is the Biodiversity  Bill's  deafening  silence  on
  genetic engineering. This omission is unacceptable at a time  when  there
  is widespread acknowledgement of the inadequacy of South  Africa's  legal
  framework on genetic engineering.

Whatever merit this criticism might have had in  February,  it  surely  does
not apply now. The Genetically Modified Organism Act  of  1997  is,  in  our
view, an adequate instrument for the control of this important new science.

Part 3 of the Bill before us, under the  section  ``Other  Threats",  clause
76(a) states clearly and unambiguously that if the Minister  has  reason  to
believe that if the release of the genetically modified  organism  into  the
environment, under a permit applied for in  terms  of  Genetically  Modified
Organism Act, may pose a threat, then no permit for such a  release  may  be
issued in terms of the Act  unless  an  environmental  assessment  has  been
conducted in  accordance  with  Chapter  5  of  the  National  Environmental
Management Act.

There is therefore what might be called a double device to protect  us  from
any  possible  harm  from  genetically  modified   organisms:   first,   the
Genetically Modified Organism Act and then the  provisions  made  in  clause
76(a) for contingency protection by the Minister of Environmental Affairs.

The second matter which  exercised  our  minds  was  how  best  to  regulate
bioprospecting and to protect the interests of those  who  might  be  called
stakeholders in benefits arising from bioprospecting.  A  good  example  for
those not familiar with this field  is  that  of  the  appetite  suppressant
which has been utilised by generations  of  Khoi  people  to  lessen  hunger
pangs. In affluent societies, where dieting is a  problem,  exploitation  of
the plant, from which the  appetite  suppressant  is  extracted,  holds  out
great promise as a commercial money-spinner.

In the Mail and Guardian article quoted earlier, the point is made that:


  International best practice stresses the needs for benefits arising  from
  commercialisation to be shared fairly with holders of knowledge or owners
  of resources, and for  their  informed  consent  to  be  obtained  before
  collection and commercialisation proceed.

This is precisely what Chapter 6 of the Bill seeks to do.  Importantly,  the
ambit of bioprospecting is widened  to  include  all  indigenous  biological
resources rather than restricting it to genetic resources only.

Furthermore, clause 80 of the Bill makes  a  watertight  provision  for  the
interests of all people and  communities  who  provide  or  give  access  to
indigenous biological resources to be protected. And so it should be!

Other excellent provisions of this Bill include the management of alien  and
invasive species  through  control  of  the  introduction,  spread  and  the
protection of rare  or  endangered  species  protected  under  international
agreements as well as threatened species, as I have already mentioned.

The National Environmental Management Amendment Bill is largely a  technical
Bill  that   provides   for   co-operative   environmental   governance   by
establishing  principles  for  decision-making  on  matters  affecting   the
environment and institutions that will promote co-operative  governance.  It
also  makes  provision  for  the  designation  of  environmental  management
inspectors. We have no problem in supporting it, also.

In closing, I can only repeat what I said in the beginning  -  that  is,  we
are dealing here with an  important  ground-breaking  piece  of  legislation
that will set the course for the protection of  our  biodiversity  for  many
years.

We have pleasure in supporting the Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs J CHALMERS: Chairperson, hon Minister, members of this House,  the  Bill
before us today aims to provide  for  the  management  and  conservation  of
South  Africa's  biodiversity  within  the   framework   of   the   National
Environmental Act of 1998.

Chapter 4 of this Bill contains provisions for the  protection  of  rare  or
threatened  species.  It  includes  those  protected   under   international
agreements as well as threatened ecosystems,  setting  out  the  listing  of
species in ecosystems on  the  basis  of  their  national  or  international
status and regulating the activities,  including  trade,  that  may  involve
such listed species  and  ecosystems.  The  scientific  authority  for  this
purpose is established, and its functions are set out.

Provisions are also made for regulations to  facilitate  the  objectives  of
this Bill. I think we need to be clear in our own minds just why this is  so
important; important locally, regionally,  nationally  and  at  the  highest
level, globally. Why is it so vital that we protect, try  to  halt  and,  if
possible, reverse the rapid disappearance  from  our  planet  of  creatures,
plants and whole ecosystems that have taken  millions  of  years  to  settle
into the complex system that  makes  up  the  biodiversity  of  our  natural
world?

The  chain  of  living  creatures  throughout  the   world   is   critically
interdependent; none exist in isolation. Remove one of those  links  forever
and, whether it be on a major or minor scale, the  domino  effect  kicks  in
with serious consequences to life further along the chain.  A  good  example
of this linkage is provided in our Eastern Cape by  the  Addo  elephant,  so
nearly wiped out of its natural habitat in the 1920s. In their absence,  the
ecosystem would have functioned very differently.  Elephants  are  important
as seed dispersers, and many plants in the Addo bush rely on the ability  of
the elephants to disperse their seed; a task that cannot be provided by  the
smaller herbivores. In their absence plant communities will change and  some
species will be lost in the long term.

In addition, in the course of their feeding  these  elephants  open  up  the
thick bush, providing feeding and refuge opportunities for a range of  other
animals, including the black rhinoceros, which otherwise would not  be  able
to  penetrate  the  thick  bush.  These  opened  up   areas   also   provide
opportunities for sun-loving plants to grow, and these would  be  lost  from
the system if they were shaded out in the absence of the elephants.  So  the
links remain intact, maintaining biodiversity and a functional ecosystem.

To cap it all, in addition to their value in maintaining  biodiversity,  the
Addo  elephants  are  a  critical  resource  to  the  region   for   tourism
operations, generating hundreds of  millions  of  rand  -  R350  million  in
tourism expenditure every year  -  and  are  the  foundation  of  a  booming
ecotourism industry.

Many of the factors that threaten human health also  threaten  biodiversity,
such as the effect of toxic and hazardous materials and forms of  pollution.
Yet biodiversity provides the basis for many traditional and local forms  of
health care, and makes numerous other  contributions  to  human  health.  We
must remember that it is the basis of some 75% of the world's modern  drugs,
which are produced by the traditional  and  modern  pharmaceutical  sectors.
When we so foolishly abuse or neglect the biodiversity  on  which  our  very
survival depends, we place at risk more than just our own health,  but  also
that of all living organisms.

Yet the human race continues on its merry way, ignoring the warning  signals
rapidly  becoming  evident.  According  to  the  International   Union   for
Conservation of  Nature  and  Natural  Resources'  Red  List  of  Threatened
Species, more than 11 000 species are currently threatened with  extinction.
Some  of  these  may  be  small,  insignificant  species,  others  are   the
magnificent mammals, such as the blue whale. But all have  a  critical  role
to play in the chain of the ecosystem that encircles our globe.

What is South Africa doing about this  massive  challenge?  Biodiversity  in
this country has up to  now  been  regulated  by  means  of  a  plethora  of
fragmented and incomplete legislation, mainly at provincial  level,  but  in
some sectors also nationally. This  has  made  it  extremely  difficult  for
those tasked with managing it to do so effectively and it has provided  few,
if any, incentives for those wishing to  use  these  resources  legally  and
sustainably.

It is no exaggeration to say that  the  sustainable  and  wise  use  of  our
natural resources, combined with the initiative to ensure in-country  value-
adding, have the potential to provide food, clothing, medicine, shelter  and
an income for millions of South Africans, the ability  to  create  thousands
of jobs and keep  the  tourists  coming.  That  is  why  we  are  not  being
unrealistic when we say that this is one of the  most  important  pieces  of
legislation to be passed since 1994, and certainly the most important  piece
of biodiversity legislation for decades.

If coupled with sound enabling regulations, and if sufficient resources  are
devoted to ensure adequate implementation, this Bill, providing as  it  does
an effective legal framework, has  the  ability  to  transform  biodiversity
management in South Africa for the good of all of its people.

The proviso in the Bill on trade regulation is particularly  important.  The
value of the international trade in wildlife has recently been estimated  at
US$11 billion per annum. And if  one  includes  fisheries  and  timber,  the
estimated value rises significantly to nearly US$160 billion.

Much of the trade in wildlife,  however,  is  conducted  illegally,  and  is
considered to be the third most significant  illegal  trade  in  the  world,
after drugs and weapons. Where are these endangered ecosystems and how  will
we know and participate in their protection? The Minister  and  MEC  of  the
relevant province will publish a  national  and  provincial  list  of  these
ecosystems,  rating  them,  respectively,  according  to  their  degree   of
degradation, how much  they  are  at  risk  and  the  degree  of  protection
required; a list that must be reviewed at least every five years.

The same protection will be  afforded  to  species  at  risk,  with  permits
required for activity in threatened or protected species. Management of  our
precious heritage or biodiversity will receive far  greater  protection  and
oversight than ever before.

Chapter 6 of the Bill before us covers bioprospecting,  access  and  benefit
sharing. Currently, there  are  no  regulations  guiding  bioprospecting  in
South Africa. This legislation is extremely important if we are  to  protect
our precious  resources  from  being  exploited  by  foreign  countries  and
foreign companies.

What is bioprospecting? It involves a search for wild  species'  genes,  and
their products,  of  actual  and  potential  use  to  humans.  That  is  the
exploration  of  biodiversity  for   commercially   valuable   genetic   and
biological resources.

What is  biopiracy?  It  is  the  commercial  exploitation  of  the  genetic
resources of a country by foreign countries without permission  and  without
benefits accruing to that country.

Throughout  human  history  wealth  has  been  targeted  for  profit.  South
Africa's rich biological heritage is extremely attractive to companies  from
around  the  globe  as  a  natural  source  of   compounds   with   medical,
agricultural, horticultural  and  environmental  applications.  We  need  to
protect it.

Provisions in this Bill require bioprospecting permit holders to enter  into
benefit-sharing agreements with relevant owners of rights in the  resources,
and  to  acquire  material  transfer  agreements  as  proof  of  access   to
resources, following consent of the holders of rights  to  those  indigenous
resources. It also provides for  the  protection  of  indigenous  biological
resources through the listing of such. A bioprospecting trust fund  will  be
created for receipt and disbursement of all fees.

It has been estimated that six cataclysmic  global  extinctions  have  taken
place on our earth over the past 450 million years, emanating  from  various
causes. The fifth was 65 million years ago, wiping out  the  dinosaurs.  The
sixth is taking place as we speak, and is well advanced, with  thousands  of
species at risk because of humankind's use and abuse of the earth's  natural
resources.

Our country is becoming increasingly aware of how  critically  important  it
is for us to have in place effective measures to  protect  our  biodiversity
for future generations.  This  Bill  will  be  an  essential  part  of  that
protection. Thank you. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson and hon  Minister.  Our  environment
plays a very important role in the existence of our people, be it for  food,
water or shelter.

With poverty being a major factor negatively impacting on our  existence,  a
healthy ecosystem can greatly assist, especially in matters  such  as  food,
security and water provision, as well as other resources necessary  for  our
survival.

Furthermore and most importantly, section 24(b), under our  Bill  of  Rights
of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 makes it  a  right
-


  ... to have the environment protected, for the  benefit  of  present  and
  future generations, through reasonable  legislative  and  other  measures
  that -


  (i) prevent pollution and ecological degradation;
  (ii)     promote conservation; and
  (iii)    secure ecologically sustainable development and use  of  natural
         resources  while  promoting   justifiable   economic   and   social
         development.

Noting the many efforts and projects that the  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism has successfully embarked upon, the MF is  confident  in
their commitment to upholding this constitutional provision.

The MF supports the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Bill  of
2003 in its efforts to manage biodiversity in South Africa.

Perhaps at this stage, I should ask our hon Minister that, when he comes  to
give his reply at the end of the debate, he will kindly let us know how  our
environment is now that we are not using the plastic bags.  Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of women!]

Thank you, Chairperson. It gives me great  pleasure  to  place  before  this
House the National  Environmental  Management:  Biodiversity  Bill  and  the
National Environmental Management Amendment Bill, or Nema.

I must say that I am proud to be a  member  of  the  team  that  considered,
debated, influenced and shaped the crafting of these pieces of  legislation.
The  Bills  must  be  seen  as  building  blocks  towards   an   integrated,
transparent and coherent environmental management goal in  general  and,  in
particular, integrated sustainable conservation.

Although the focus of my speech  will  be  on  Nema,  I  think  it  will  be
necessary to place the two Bills  before  you  within  the  context  of  the
broader legislation reform initiatives of the democratic Government  of  the
country. This is important if one has to understand where  these  Bills  fit
within the broader scheme of legal reform in our country.

Members will recall that, soon after the heroic transition to  democracy  in
1994, the new democratic Government embarked  on  an  extensive  policy  and
legal reform as a step towards eradicating apartheid while constructing  and
transforming the economic setting of the country.

Amongst  other  things,  this  triggered   a   thorough   and   consultative
environmental law reform process, which started with the  publication  of  a
White Paper on Environmental Management Policy for South Africa in 1998.  As
a first step in  giving  effect  to  this  policy,  Parliament  enacted  the
flagship National Environmental Management Amendment Act, Nema, in 1998.

The National Environmental Management Act sets the framework  for  the  more
detailed sectoral environmental legislation. These  include,  among  others,
the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Bill, which is in  front
of you today. The drafting of  the  sectoral  legislation  necessitated  the
amendment of Nema to support and strengthen  these  pieces  of  legislation,
hence the tabling of the Nema Bill before you today.

Moreover, the Constitution, as the supreme law  of  the  land,  through  the
environmental right provision in section 24, requires the Government to  put
mechanisms in place so as to  measure  a  healthy  and  decent  environment,
conducive to the wellbeing  of  all,  to  ensure  that  the  environment  is
protected, and to  promote  sustainable  development  and  use  the  natural
resources while promoting justifiable economic and  social  development.  It
is against this background that the two pieces of legislation were  crafted.


Nema provides for a  variety  of  mechanisms  for  the  achievement  of  the
constitutional requirements. Central to this amendment is  the  creation  of
an enforcement arm to monitor compliance and enforce environmental laws.  It
does so by providing for the designation and  appointment  of  environmental
management inspectors.

The Minister, or the provincial MECs  for  environmental  affairs  in  their
respective provinces, will designate the inspectors who will be  responsible
for environmental affairs in  their  provinces.  These  inspectors  will  be
appointed subject to specific prescribed qualifications  and  standards  and
will have extensive powers to enforce our environmental laws.

They will have some of the powers of the SAPS, such as powers to  enter  and
search vehicles, vessels and aircraft. They will also have powers  to  seize
items  and  carry  out  routine  inspections  and  will  be  able  to  issue
compliance notices. Moreover, the Bill  provides  for  these  powers  to  be
extended to the SAPS for the enforcement of designated environmental laws.

Recent experience has shown that there is a need  for  such  an  enforcement
law. Environmental crimes are escalating. An example of this  is  the  well-
known poaching of abalone. People have been able to escape the long  arm  of
the  law,  the  reason  being  that  they  have  identified  gaps   in   our
environmental laws and have capitalised on that.

The weak enforcement provision in our  environmental  legislation  makes  it
easy for criminals not to comply with the law  while  making  it  impossible
for our officials to bring them to book. If this situation continues, I  can
assure  you  that  the  country's  precious  environmental  and   ecological
resources will soon be depleted.

It is against this background that the amendments to  Nema  before  you  are
needed as a matter of  urgency.  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise.] [Applause.] [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Hon Chairperson, I  think
that is rather appropriate. I will tell you why in a moment.  Let  me  first
say that some speakers, the hon Chalmers and hon Moorcroft, have  said  that
this is one of the most  important  pieces  of  legislation  that  has  been
placed before Parliament, and I want to agree with that.

The import of this legislation is very far-reaching indeed.  In  fact,  much
of this legislation  is  ground  breaking.  Hon  Moorcroft  referred  to  an
article  about  international  best  practice.  In   fact,   there   is   no
international best practice in much of what we are dealing with,  in  things
like benefit sharing and the GMO issue.

This legislation is ground breaking. I can assure  you  that  people  around
the world, including those  in  developed  countries,  will  be  looking  at
certain aspects of this legislation for lessons to be learnt.

I have to report, before I do anything else, to the hon Rajbally  about  the
impact of the plastic bags. I must  just  say  that  we  have  been  getting
reports from all around the country that there has been  a  discernible  and
immediately visible impact of the plastic bag legislation. People  from  all
over have been reporting that in areas and places  where  there  was  litter
before - plastic bags all over the show in fields, on trees, on  fences,  on
beaches and in all sorts of places - there is nothing now. [Applause.]

I must say that this House supported me on that, and I think all of  us  can
feel extremely proud. The manner in which South Africans have taken to  this
new  legislation  is  once  again  internationally  ground   breaking;   not
international best practice, but better than  international  best  practice.
That is what we do in South Africa. [Applause.]

I must say that this very far-reaching piece  of  legislation  is  extremely
complex. Before the hon Dorothy Motubatsi-Hounkpatin  leaves,  let  me  just
say to her - because she was one of the leaders of the women's tent  at  the
WSSD, and taking a great interest in that, and also one of  the  leaders  of
the women's movement, but particularly for her role during the  WSSD.  I  am
also happy that the hon Lulu Xingwana has walked  in  at  this  late  stage,
because she is the leader of women in Parliament and the leader of women  in
the SADC parliaments - it is my pleasure to report to you  that  in  today's
debate there were seven speakers, of which five were women. [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: I also want to report  to
you that this Bill has been processed by a committee which  was  chaired  by
the hon Mahlangu-Nkabinde, who is also a woman. [Applause.]

More importantly, something which you may not  be  aware  of,  is  that  the
officials of the department who for many months, in  fact  for  many  years,
have  been  writing  the  legislation,  debating  it  with   the   portfolio
committee, debating  it  at  public  hearings  with  interest  groups,  with
environmental organisations and with industry, are all women.

I would like to introduce some of them to you. The leader, who is not  here,
is Miss Pamela Yacko. She is the DD-G. She is busy  with  other  duties,  so
she is not here, but you can see from the name that it is a  woman,  if  you
do not know her. Other members of her team who are here presently are  Maria
Mbengashe. Please stand up, Mrs Mbengashe. [Applause.] We have  Miss  Koekie
Maphanga who is also here ... [Applause.] ... and Miss Lesego Sello is  also
here, and, of course, my ministerial parliamentary officer, Rina  Agherdien,
is also here, although she has not drafted the Bill.

As you can see, I can  assure  you  that  we  had  to  face  formidable  and
powerful  interest  groups,  and  many  authorities,  provinces  and   local
authorities, but this is  a  team  that  you  do  not  want  to  face  in  a
negotiation, I can assure you of that. [Applause.]

Then of course I must thank the D-G, Dr  Olver,  who  has  inspired  all  of
this. One of the reasons we have succeeded in  completing  this  legislation
is because of the dogged determination of the director-general.  I  did  not
think that we would be able to complete it. Thank you very  much,  you  were
right in the end. I thank you all. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF MONTREAL AND BEIJING
  AMENDMENTS TO THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL ON SUBSTANCES THAT DEPLETE THE OZONE
              LAYER, IN TERMS OF SECTION 231(2) OF CONSTITUTION

Ms  G  L  MAHLANGU-NKABINDE:  Ke  a   leboga   Modulasetilo.   [Thank   you,
Chairperson.]

South Africa has always been regarded as a developed country  when  it  came
to this protocol, because the past regime  excluded  all  the  Africans  who
found themselves in the TBVC states, and as a result taxpayers here  paid  a
lot of money on the level of all the developed countries.  Thanks  to  Peter
Mokaba and a number of officials in 1997 who went to  Montreal  and  changed
the status of South Africa, this was amended.  Otherwise,  the  requirements
on us as a country would have been that of a  developed  country,  and  this
was the only protocol in this country that was ever subjected  to  developed
status.

There is no doubt that South Africa is doing extremely well  in  as  far  as
protection  and  conservation  is  concerned.  We  have  proved   that   the
environment is as important as the defence of the country. There  are  those
countries that have not looked after their environments, and they  are  very
sorry today because of that. I am very happy that under your  guidance,  and
the leadership of Comrade  Chippy  and  the  wonderful  ladies  who  are  so
resourceful, we have been able to pass good legislation almost every  month.
We have done extremely well. [Applause.] I know others say  so,  but  it  is
also important for us to say so. [Applause.]

The Montreal Protocol is not new to South Africa.  We  ratified  the  London
Amendment   to   the   Protocol,   designed   to   restrict   the   use   of
chlorofluorocarbons and haloids, on  12  May  1992.  We  also  approved  the
ratification of the Copenhagen Amendment to  this  protocol.  Granting  this
request will lead to the phasing  out  and  the  eventual  disappearance  of
ozone-depleting  substances.  It  is  our  responsibility,  as  members   of
Parliament, to fight degradation of  the  environment.  We  owe  it  to  our
children and to generations to come.

Irresponsible human activities lead to global warming and  ozone  depletion.
This can be reversed if we all act together to provide  a  safe  environment
for our children and generations to come. The portfolio  committee  supports
the amendments. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Montreal and Beijing Amendments to the Montreal Protocol on Substances  that
Deplete the Ozone Layer approved.

   CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN
 DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) PROTOCOL ON CULTURE, INFORMATION AND SPORT, IN
                   TERMS OF SECTION 231(2) OF CONSTITUTION

Mr N NGCOBO: Chairperson, hon Minister and  hon  members  of  Parliament,  I
stand here on behalf of the Portfolio Committee on  Arts,  Culture,  Science
and Technology to present to you the SADC Protocol on  Culture,  Information
and  Sport.  The  SADC  Protocol  on  Culture,  Information  and  Sport  was
presented, discussed and adopted during the SADC committee of  ministers  of
culture, information and sport on 30 May 2001 in Mauritius.

The line function departments representing  this  historic  event  were  the
Government Communication and Information Services, GCIS, the  Department  of
Sport and  Recreation,  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry,  and  the
Department of Arts and Culture. On 14 August 2001, the protocol was  finally
signed in Blantyre, Malawi, by the heads of SADC member countries.

Other than culture, the protocol includes competencies such  as  information
which is seated with our regional databank, known as  the  Southern  African
Cultural Information Systems, or SACIS, which in the South  African  context
represents the GCIS. It also  includes  sport,  which  is  seated  with  the
Department of Sport and Recreation, as well as  copyright  and  neighbouring
rights, seated with the Department of Trade and Industry.

The signing of the  protocol  in  August  2001  was  a  culmination  of  the
strategy of the OAU as laid down in the first stage of the Abuja  Treaty  of
1991. In this treaty it is  stated  that  the  African  community  shall  be
established in six stages of variable duration over a  transitional  period,
not exceeding 34 years. The important role that  culture  can  play  in  the
regional integration agenda was recognised  within  SADC  as  one  that  can
successfully bring grassroots involvement.

The SADC declaration of  heads  of  state  and  government  issued  in  1992
follows from this. It states that regional integration would continue to  be
a pipe dream unless the people of the region  determine  its  content,  form
its direction and are themselves its active agents.

The treaty itself declares that one  of  the  objectives  of  this  regional
organisation is to strengthen and consolidate the long-standing  historical,
social and cultural affinities and links among the people of the region.  It
is for this reason that the  SADC  has  taken  a  political  view  that  its
regional integration agenda should be driven by the people  and  their  will
to live together and to share in a common destiny.

According to Chapter 14 of the Constitution, section  231(2),  the  protocol
needs to be presented and approved by the resolution of both the NA and  the
NCOP. On 11 November 2003, the SADC Protocol  on  Culture,  Information  and
Sport was submitted by the Department of Arts and Culture as  the  country's
contact point for the sector to the Portfolio Committee  on  Arts,  Culture,
Science and Technology for ratification.

The portfolio committee then recommended on the same date  that  the  House,
in terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, approves the said  protocol.
On  behalf  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology, I, therefore, move that this protocol be ratified. [Applause.]

Southern  African  Development  Community  (SADC)   Protocol   on   Culture,
Information and Sport approved.

The House adjourned at 18:50.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Mediation Committee on the Liquor Bill [B 23B and B  23D
     - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76), dated 19 November 2003:


         The Mediation Committee, having considered the Liquor Bill  [B  23B
         and B 23D - 2003] (National Assembly - sec  76),  as  well  as  the
         papers referred to it, reports as follows:


         1. The Liquor Bill [B 23B - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76)  was
              passed  by  the  National  Assembly  on  21  August  2003  and
              submitted to the National Council of Provinces for approval.


         2. The National Council of Provinces passed the Liquor Bill [B  23D
              - 2003] (National Assembly  -  sec  76)  on  8  October  2003,
              containing a number of amendments  agreed  to  by  the  Select
              Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs.


         3. Upon referral  of  the  latter  amended  Bill  to  the  National
              Assembly, that House accepted some of the amendments passed by
              the National Council  of  Provinces,  with  the  exception  of
              Clause 6(2) of the Bill. Consequently, the  National  Assembly
              rejected the Bill.
         4. The Bill was referred to the Mediation Committee on 18  November
              2003 in terms of Joint Rule 186(1)(b) of the  Joint  Rules  of
              Parliament. The Mediation Committee met on 19  November  2003,
              and, after deliberation, agreed to submit another  version  of
              the Bill.


         5. The effect of this decision is that the Secretary to  Parliament
              is required to submit the latter version of the Bill  to  both
              the Speaker and the Chairperson of the  Council  in  terms  of
              Joint Rule 188(3), for consideration  by  the  House  and  the
              Council.


         6. The Committee therefore submits the Liquor Bill [B 23F  -  2003]
              (National Assembly - sec 76), and recommends  that  the  House
              and the Council pass this mediated version.

2.    Report of the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence,  dated  5
     November 2003:
         The Joint Standing Committee  on  Intelligence,  having  met  on  5
         November 2003, wishes to report as follows:


              The  Committee  welcomes  the   appointment   of   the   Hefer
              Commission.


              However, the Committee views with alarm  and  serious  concern
              the issuing of subpoenas by  the  Hefer  Commission  to  South
              Africa's Intelligence and Security Services compelling them to
              provide classified and  or  sensitive  information  that  will
              purportedly  serve  the  Commission's  purpose.  Ignoring  the
              provisions of the law relating to national security  in  order
              to satisfy the objectives of the Hefer  Commission  will  have
              serious consequences for South Africa  both  domestically  and
              internationally.


              The role of the Committee, amongst other things, is to  ensure
              that South Africas' Intelligence and Security Services protect
              and preserve the country's national security, the  defence  of
              the Republic and the investigation, combating of crime and the
              protection of classified and or sensitive information in their
              possession.  It  is  a  universally  accepted  principle  that
              information in the possession  of  the  Intelligence  Services
              cannot be made public. This includes especially the  names  of
              sources, agents, operatives and identities of members.


              The  Committee  therefore  supports  the   position   of   the
              Intelligence Services as presented to the Hefer Commission. We
              believe that the Intelligence and Security Services should not
              be embroiled in this matter and that those  who  have  brought
              the matter into the public domain, should  provide  the  basis
              for their allegations to be tested by the  Commission  without
              causing databases and files of the Intelligence  and  Security
              Services to be inspected at great risk to  the  Constitutional
              mandate of these structures.

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
     Technology on Visit to Freedom Park, dated 11 November 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture, Science  and  Technology,
         having sent a delegation to Freedom Park, reports as follows:


              The delegation, under the leadership  of  Mrs  T  J  Tshivhase
              (ANC) consisted of Mr V C Gore (DP), Ms X C Makasi (ANC), Dr R
              Rabinowitz (IFP) and Mr J Ramrock (Committee Secretary).


              The purpose of the visit was  to  meet  with  members  of  the
              Freedom Park Board and to monitor the structural progress that
              has been made with the building of the park.


              Introduction


              The Freedom Park project is  a  national  government  project,
              approved by Cabinet in June  1989.  The  project  entails  the
              development of commemorative structures at the  Salvokop  site
              in Pretoria. The object of the project is to establish visible
              cultural structures that celebrate and  commemorate  the  rich
              tapestry of events that have  taken  place  on  South  African
              soil, from the "Cradle of  Humanity"  through  pre-history  to
              colonisation to the  struggle  for  democracy  and  stretching
              beyond to a vision for the future.


              Findings
              The delegation met  with  the  Executive  Chairperson  of  the
              Freedom Park Trust,  Dr  Wally  Serote,  officials  and  other
              members of staff.


              Dr Serote gave the delegation a briefing on the progress  that
              has been made with the  project  and  mentioned  some  of  the
              potential problems that the Trust is faced with, in particular
              the present housing complex, which is still occupied. Attempts
              to try and relocate the people staying in  those  houses  have
              failed, but there are ongoing discussions  between  the  Trust
              and Transnet, the owner of the complex, to try and resolve the
              problem.


              Another concern for the Trust is the possible  impact  of  the
              Gautrain on the building  of  the  monument.  The  train  will
              ostensibly travel right through the middle of the park. An  ad
              hoc committee, consisting of eight Ministries, the  Presidency
              and the Trust, have  been  tasked  to  try  and  resolve  this
              problem.


              Freedom Park consists of three major elements:


              1.  The Memorial, which is centered around the  anti-apartheid
                  struggle,  the  anti-colonial  struggle   and   historical
                  events. The structure  is  expected  to  be  completed  by
                  2006.


              2.   The  Museum,  which   emphasises   the   acknowledgement,
                  preservation and presentation of  South  Africa's  history
                  for present and future generations.


              3.  The Garden of Remembrance, which focuses  on  people's  or
                  communities' positive contribution to the  development  of
                  the country.


              The delegation was also addressed by two Traditional  Healers,
              Ms  Matshilo  Motsei  and  Ms  Koena  Tsebe,  who  served   as
              consultants for the Trust. The two were also tasked to conduct
              research on the spiritual significance to healing  in  African
              life of the rock, water and circle. They mentioned that it  is
              envisaged that the Garden of Remembrance will become a  sacred
              space designed for individual and group  spiritual  uplifting.
              Constituted by boulders and water, the Garden will represent a
              home founded on, and solid as, a rock, whilst its spirit flows
              and cleanses like water. One of the  pre-requisite  activities
              that needs to be done before the construction  can  begin,  is
              the rovincial and national cleansing and healing process. This
              process has started already in  the  provinces.  Boulders  (to
              immortalise  the  departed),  soil  and  provincial   heritage
              plants, to be used as symbols of unity and  healing,  will  be
              collected from all nine provinces. The President  has  already
              planted a few indigenous trees at the park. It is through  the
              boulders that the departed will be  immortalised.  There  will
              also be a boulder representing National  Government.  Boulders
              from foreign countries, where our people fell, will be brought
              in by Ambassadors of those countries, to the hill.


              The delegation was taken to the site at Salvokop and shown the
              different construction level  points.  It  became  clear  that
              there still remains a lot to be done,  including  security  at
              the site, but  the  delegation  was  pleased  with  what  they
              observed and the progress made with the  construction  of  the
              park. There is no doubt that all South Africans will be  proud
              of the park, which is scheduled for completion around 2010.
              The Committee wishes to commend Dr Serote and the Freedom Park
              Board, including staff, for the inspirational work  that  they
              are doing.


              The Committee is committed to ensuring that the representation
              of historical truth is as inclusive  as  possible,  reflecting
              the parts played by a wide range of role-players. To this end,
              future interaction and  feedback  between  those  writing  the
              history and the Committee should be ongoing.  This  will  feed
              into the objective of healing and reconciliation.
