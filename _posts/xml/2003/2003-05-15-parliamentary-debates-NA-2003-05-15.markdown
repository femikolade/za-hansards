                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House debates the new draft Bill on  religion  in  education  in
  public and private schools and the prominent  role  of  the  Minister  of
  Education in prescribing inflexible guidelines for  governing  bodies  to
  implement, including religious ethos in schools.

                          INTERNATIONAL FAMILY DAY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E SALOOJEE (ANC): Today is International Family Day. The  family  is  the
basic unit in society which must be supported, protected  and  strengthened.
Different societies and  social  systems  have  different  forms  of  family
structures. Families as basic units of  society  should  reflect  a  society
which upholds and defends human rights, especially the rights of  women  and
the girl child. This means,  among  other  things,  that  marriage  must  be
entered into with free consent of the intending  spouses,  and  husband  and
wife should be equal partners.

As we celebrate International  Family  Day,  we  must  tirelessly  work  for
formulation and implementation of social  and  economic  policies  that  are
designed, amongst other things, to meet the needs of families  -  especially
the poor and needy, the disadvantaged and the vulnerable - and we  must  pay
attention to children and the girl child. We must create  opportunities  for
family members to understand and meet their social responsibilities, and  we
must promote tolerance and co-operation. We must pursue these tasks as  part
of  the  overall  challenge  of  transforming  South  Africa  into  a  truly
nonracial, nonsexist and democratic country. [Applause.]

             INFRINGEMENT OF AUTONOMY OF SCHOOL GOVERNING BODIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W P DOMAN (DA): Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Department  of  Education's
plan to outlaw additional remuneration and perks by school governing  bodies
for teachers who are excellent and  hard  to  replace  is  extremely  short-
sighted and seriously infringes on the autonomy of  these  bodies.  It  will
lead to an exodus of the best teachers from the public school system  either
to private schools, overseas or out of the profession altogether. They  will
be replaced at former Model C schools by the next best  qualified  teachers,
stripping poorer schools of their best ones. Everyone loses.

Die enigste volhoubare manier om ongelykhede tussen die voormalige model  C-
skole en armer skole te verminder, is om toestande  vir  sowel  leerders  as
onderwysers by laasgenoemdes te verbeter. Minister Asmal het 'n  tekort  aan
onderwysers, veral in sleutelvakke soos Wiskunde en Wetenskap, as  'n  groot
uitdaging in sy departement geïdentifiseer  en  onder  meer  vroeër  vanjaar
senior onderwysposte geskep. Die DA het herhaaldelik betoog dat  onderwysers
met skaars vaardighede deeglik vergoed  moet  word.  Skoolbeheerliggame  wat
hul eie geld insamel om uitstekende en feitlik onvervangbare onderwysers  te
behou, gee die regering die kans om die klem te plaas op skole wat  nie  hul
eie geld kan insamel nie.

AGB  LEDE:  Hoor,  hoor!  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   member's
statement follows.)

[The only sustainable manner in which  to  reduce  the  disparities  between
former Model C schools and poorer schools, is to improve conditions for  the
learners, as well as the teachers, at the  poorer  schools.  Minister  Asmal
identified a shortage of teachers, especially in key subjects such as  maths
and science, as a  major  challenge  in  his  department  and,  inter  alia,
earlier this  year  he  created  posts  for  senior  teachers.  The  DA  has
repeatedly argued that  teachers  with  scarce  skills  should  be  properly
rewarded. School governing bodies that generate their own  income  in  order
to retain excellent  and  practically  irreplaceable  teachers  provide  the
Government with the opportunity  to  place  the  emphasis  on  schools  that
cannot generate their own income.

HON MEMBERS: Hear, hear! [Applause.]]

      GRANTING TAIWAN WHO MEMBERSHIP FOR ITS CONTRIBUTION AGAINST SARS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Madam Speaker, in her budget debate the hon  Minister
of Health referred  to  the  importance  of  international  co-operation  in
fighting disease that affects every member of our global village.  The  Sars
virus does so. The virus has  affected  both  human  health  and  economies,
particularly in the East. But  the  government  and  people  of  Taiwan  are
trying every possible avenue to address this situation, although  Taiwan  is
not accepted as a member of the  World  Health  Organisation,  or  WHO.  Its
people have been given extensive  invaluable  information  on  the  disease.
Disease detection techniques have been used in education and films  produced
and shown to the public. Taiwan's government is also  working  closely  with
international health  agencies  by  providing  them  with  regular  progress
reports, etc.

Taiwan has had  23  suspected  Sars  infection  cases  but  no  deaths  have
occurred, compared to other East Asian countries in which the death toll  is
mounting into thousands. China, where the infection  originated,  suppressed
information on its  Sars  status  to  the  international  community  to  the
disadvantage of its own people. Therefore, it could be seen that  Taiwan  is
providing a very valuable influence and guide to the people of the East.  It
is strange that our Government has not lobbied more persistently for  Taiwan
to become recognised, if not as a WHO member, then  at  least  for  observer
status - in spite of the WHO's commitment to the right to  health  of  every
individual on the globe.

Many friendly governments, WHO officials and other health organisations  are
expressing the urgent need for Taiwan to become at least an observer  member
of the WHO. We would like to appeal to our hon Minister of  Health  and  the
hon Minister of Foreign Affairs to make an effort and to make  their  voices
heard in trying to gain status for Taiwan in the WHO.

            CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE UK AND RSA REGARDING AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D J SITHOLE (ANC): The British Foreign Secretary, Mr Jack  Straw,  is  on
an official visit to South Africa. The aim of  this  official  visit  is  to
consolidate relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom.  He  held
bilateral discussions with the hon Minister of Foreign Affairs on 13 and  14
May 2003. The two Ministers discussed peace and security initiatives in  the
Great Lakes region, Nepad,  the  African  Union,  the  relationship  between
Africa and the G8  countries,  the  post-war  reconstruction  of  Iraq,  and
Zimbabwe. In this meeting, Mr Jack Straw reiterated the  commitment  of  the
UK in  supporting  South  Africa's  democratic  transformation,  Nepad,  the
African Union and South Africa's role in building  peace  and  stability  on
the African continent.

The  outcome  of  this  bilateral  meeting  indicates  the   importance   of
solidarity and co-operation between the  countries  of  the  North  and  the
South in fighting poverty and underdevelopment. The ANC and  the  people  of
South Africa welcome Mr Jack Straw to our country. We hope  that  his  visit
will contribute positively in our endeavour to  build  a  just,  democratic,
nonracial and prosperous South Africa. [Applause.]

             CONGRATULATIONS TO CAPE FORUM ON IRISH INVESTMENTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R T RHODA (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP wants to  congratulate  the
Cape Forum  on  securing  the  latest  series  of  investments  by  property
developers from  Ireland.  The  investments  must  be  seen  as  a  vote  of
confidence in Cape  Town  as  a  major  international  tourist  destination,
adding the Irish to an already long list of foreign tourists coming to  Cape
Town. As Irish tourists are regarded as some of the  biggest  spenders  from
Europe, the city can prepare itself for an even bigger cash  injection  into
the local trade.

Foreign  investments  such  as  this  one  will   contribute   towards   the
revitalisation of the central business district. Such  investments  must  be
seen as an acknowledgement of the stable environment created by the New  NP-
ANC council. The fact that more than R5 billion has  been  invested  in  the
CBD during the past three years is  a  definite  sign  that  more  and  more
foreign investors regard the Western Cape as a safe haven for  their  money.
The New NP wishes these  latest  investors  every  success  with  their  new
venture. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  would  ask  you  not  to  distribute
``gifts'' in the House. Permission ...  [Interjections.]  I  am  sorry,  but
there are procedures for this  which  were  not  carried  out.  You  do  not
distribute  gifts  outside  the  National  Assembly  Chamber.  Now,  it  has
happened; that is fine. But please, members are  now  walking  in  in  large
numbers and distributing them. Please, will you  desist.  Service  officers,
will you please prevent this from happening? Thank you.

               VISIBLE POLICING NEEDED TO ENFORCE ROAD SAFETY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J T MASEKA (UDM): Madam Speaker, over  the  past  months  South  Africans
have been shocked by a quick succession  of  gruesome  road  accidents.  The
tragic loss of life was not limited to the Saulspoort Dam disaster only.  We
extend our sympathies to the family members and friends of  the  people  who
passed away.

We realise that what these people expect from this Parliament is  more  than
its sympathy. They expect concrete action to reduce the  staggering  20  000
deaths that occur annually on South African roads. This string of  accidents
has also illustrated that the focus of  road  safety  programmes  on  public
holidays only is not a viable strategy. The involvement of vehicles of  mass
transportation such as taxis,  buses  and  even  trucks  in  many  of  these
accidents has conspired to aggravate the  number  of  deaths  and  injuries.
Last December alone 141 taxis were involved in accidents which  claimed  the
lives of 186 passengers and drivers.

It is therefore vital that the rules of the road pertaining specifically  to
these vehicles be most stringently policed. The  100  km/h  speed  limit  as
well as the roadworthiness of these vehicles must become core elements in  a
more active  traffic  policing  strategy.  Low-intensity  efforts,  such  as
unmanned speed traps, will not  stop  the  carnage.  We  need  more  traffic
officers on our roads who actively promote and enforce road safety.

                     TOURISM 2003 INDABA HELD IN DURBAN

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms G L  MAHLANGU-NKABINDE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  as  South  Africa  heads
towards celebrating a decade of democracy, we can indeed be  very  proud  of
the level of transformation we have achieved in  different  sectors  of  our
society, including the tourism industry.

The  Tourism  2003  Indaba,  which  was  recently  held  in  Durban,  was  a
reflection of the remarkable commitment by the country's tourism  operators,
in partnership with  Government,  to  ensure  that  South  Africa's  tourism
continues to go from strength to strength and that partnerships  are  forged
within the continent and beyond, making  the  vision  of  Nepad  a  reality.
South Africa is currently the world's best  performing  tourist  destination
and the indaba has once again proved to the world that we do indeed offer  a
unique South African tourism experience. This commitment has  seen  a  total
of 274 SMMEs exhibiting at this  year's  indaba  -  remarkable  growth  when
compared to 34 just three years ago.

The official opening of the indaba by our President Thabo Mbeki  is  further
proof that Government recognises the vital role played  by  tourism  in  the
country's economy and its contribution to the growth  of  the  GDP  and  the
creation of much-needed jobs. We congratulate all nine of our  provinces  on
their participation in the Indaba and to the  Limpopo  province,  for  their
outstanding performance, we  say:  Vho  shuma  zwihulwanesa.  Vho  tana  zwa
khwinesa kha vhathu vha Limpopo. Vho dzhia liga  lihulwanesa,  sa  zwenezwo,
shango lothe li a vha fhululedza. [U vhanda zwanda.] [They have worked  very
hard. They exhibited the best amongst the Limpopo people. They took  a  huge
step; therefore, the whole country applauds them. [Applause.]]

                       BUS ACCIDENT AT SAULSPOORT DAM

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr C P MULDER (VF): Mev die Speaker, op 1 Mei vanjaar is  Suid-Afrika  geruk
deur die busongeluk by die Saulspoortdam in die Oos Vrystaat. 'n Bus met  61
passasiers beland in die dam met tragiese gevolge. Slegs 10 passasiers  word
gered, maar 51 mense sterf 'n wrede dood, vasgevang  in  'n  bus  onder  die
water. Dis egter nie die eerste keer dat dit in Suid-Afrika gebeur  nie.  Op
'n  herfsdag,  27  Maart  1985,  beland  'n  skoolbus  in  Johannesburg   op
soorgelyke wyse in die Westdenedam en 42 skoolkinders sterf 'n  wrede  dood,
vasgekeer in 'n bus onder die water.

'n Mens kan vra hoe dit moontlik is dat so  iets  17  jaar  later  weer  kan
gebeur.  Die  skokkende  werklikheid  is  dat  busse  in   Suid-Afrika   nie
nooduitgange het nie. En tog  ry  elke  bus  met  'n  groot  plakker  op  sy
agterruit wat sê: ``Nooduitgang/Emergency Exit''. Tydens 'n ondersoek op  'n
paar toetsterreine word dit duidelik dat ja,  elke  bus  is  verplig  om  'n
plakker op te hê, maar dit is waar dit eindig. Dit is nie die taak  van  die
toetsbeamptes om vas te stel of daar wel 'n nooduitgang bestaan nie,  solank
daar net 'n plakker op is. Anders as wat ons almal dink en glo,  is  daardie
groot agtervensters nie werklik nooduitgange nie en daar is geen manier  hoe
mense wat in so 'n bus vasgekeer is daardeur sal kan ontsnap nie.

Die VF wil daarom as 'n saak van uiterste  dringendheid  'n  beroep  op  die
Minister van Vervoer doen om dadelik iets hieraan te  doen.  Hoe  lank  moet
ons nog voortgaan om mense onder sulke gevaarlike omstandighede  te  vervoer
in Suid-Afrika? (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER (FF): Madam Speaker, on 1 May  this  year  South  Africa  was
rocked by the bus accident at the Saulspoort Dam in the eastern Free  State.
A bus with 61 passengers ended up in  the  dam,  with  tragic  consequences.
Only 10 passengers were saved, but 51 people died a cruel death, trapped  in
a bus underwater. However, it was not the first time that this had  happened
in South Africa.  On  an  autumn  day,  27  March  1985,  a  school  bus  in
Johannesburg ended up in the  Westdene  Dam  in  a  similar  manner  and  42
schoolchildren died a cruel death, trapped in a bus underwater.

One can ask how it is possible that something like that could  happen  again
17 years later. The shocking reality is that buses in South  Africa  do  not
have emergency exits. And yet every bus has a  large  sticker  on  its  back
window that reads:

``Nooduitgang/Emergency Exit''. During an investigation  at  a  few  testing
stations it became clear that every bus has to have a  sticker  on  it,  but
that is where it ends.  It  is  not  the  job  of  the  testing  officer  to
determine whether an  emergency  exit  exists,  as  long  as  a  sticker  is
affixed. Unlike what we all think and believe, those big  back  windows  are
not really emergency exits and there is no way that people who  are  trapped
in such a bus would be able to escape through them.

The FF therefore, as a matter of extreme urgency, wants  to  appeal  to  the
Minister of Transport to do something about  this  matter  immediately.  How
much longer must we  continue  to  transport  people  under  such  dangerous
conditions in South Africa?]

                          POOR CONDITION OF SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr M S MOGOBA (PAC): Madam Speaker, a recent visit to schools  in  the  Nebo
and Groblersdal area has revealed that these schools  are  sadly  neglected.
Two schools have had their roofs ripped off by a  storm,  one  of  them  two
years ago. Somehow these schools are still without  roofs  and  one  wonders
why it is so difficult to replace these roofs so that children can  use  the
classrooms again.

Many schools also had the problem of a shortage of textbooks.  The  Minister
had assured us that this year would be different from past  years  and  that
textbooks would be available when schools reopened in January. Some  schools
had not yet received textbooks and stationery by April.

Some schools had no water on the premises. Schoolchildren carry a  provision
of water from home - there is no washing water and no waterborne sewerage.

Two schools needed a scraper to level the fields and were  prepared  to  pay
for the diesel, but they were sent from one department  to  another  without
any help. This situation calls for urgent intervention by the Government.

                       BUS ACCIDENT AT SAULSPOORT DAM

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof B TUROK (ANC): Madam Speaker, I also want to refer to the bus  accident
in the Free State on May Day, which resulted in the  deaths  of  51  workers
and which was a terrible tragedy. The fact that there  has  been  more  than
one statement  on  this  issue  today  indicates  that  the  House  is  very
concerned about that event.

We would like to reiterate our deep sense of sorrow and solidarity with  the
bereaved families, with the community of Galeshewe  and  with  the  comrades
and colleagues of the deceased in SAMWU and Cosatu.  This  was  one  of  the
worst-ever road accidents in our country's history. It once more  underlines
the importance of persistently addressing questions of  safety  with  regard
to public transport.

 We believe that over the past few years  we  have  made  progress,  working
together with the bus industry. A maximum bus speed of  100  km/h  has  been
introduced, and standards and norms  for  bus  drivers'  working  conditions
have been agreed upon and implemented, at least by reputable bus  companies.
Clearly, where the safety of the public is concerned, we  can  never  become
complacent.

The ANC Government has promised  a  comprehensive  investigation  into  this
accident. The acting Minister of Transport, the hon Jeff  Radebe,  has  also
promised improved road  signage,  especially  on  secondary  roads.  Further
steps to prevent road carnage of this magnitude will be dictated  partly  by
the outcomes and recommendations of this investigation.

We  commend  the  ANC  Government  for  acting  speedily  by  announcing  an
investigation into this accident and further  announcing  some  measures  to
prevent accidents of this nature from happening. The ANC lowers  its  banner
in honour of the workers and the people's heroes that lost  their  lives  in
this accident. I thank you.

                      VIOLENT CRIME IN THE RURAL AREAS

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv P S SWART (DA): Mev die Speaker, Suid-Afrika se  landelike  gemeenskappe
lewe in vrees. Hulle word elke dag beroof, verkrag,  aangerand  en  vermoor.
Terwyl hierdie vlaag van geweld  voortduur,  speel  die  regering  politiek.
Selfs die toename in mannekrag of die implementering  van  sektorpolisiëring
bied geen  hoop  nie.  Die  nuwe  polisielede  is  grootliks  geoormerk  vir
ontplooiing in stedelike gebiede en sal bitter  min  verskil  maak  aan  die
situasie in landelike gebiede.

Die kommando-eenhede is 'n teiken in hierdie politieke spel en dit moet  nou
end kry. Die DA is op rekord met 'n pleidooi vir  die  versterking  van  die
kommando's met mannekrag en groter  finansiële  ondersteuning.  (Translation
of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Adv P S SWART (DA): Madam Speaker, South  Africa's  rural  communities  are
living in fear. They are robbed, raped, assaulted and  murdered  every  day.
While this wave of violence continues, the Government is  playing  politics.
Even the increase in manpower or the implementation of sector policing  does
not offer any hope. The new  police  members  are  primarily  earmarked  for
deployment in urban areas and  will  make  very  little  difference  to  the
situation in rural areas.

The commando units are a target in this political game and  this  must  stop
now. The DA has on record an appeal for the reinforcement of  the  commandos
with manpower and greater financial support.]

But the confusion is back. Will the commandos be phased out,  will  they  be
restructured - apparently the President's latest sentiment -  and  how  will
they be empowered in the interim period, whatever the final product?

We need clarity, not political games by  the  President,  nor  opportunistic
ploys by the leader of the New NP, who in essence calls for the  status  quo
with some empowerment. The ANC must bring clarity  and  state  their  policy
decision clearly to enable serious political discussion  to  continue.  Stop
this game-playing while our people are being murdered. [Interjections.]

                          VIOLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP):  Madam  Speaker,  the  CCMA  journal  of  March  2003
discusses workplace violence  as  an  international  phenomenon  that  gives
expression in physical assault, homicide, verbal abuse, bullying and  sexual
harassment, to mention a few. Such suffering and its  aftermath  is  endured
not only by those physically involved  but  even  by  those  who  share  the
environment.

Physical  violence  in  the  workplace  is  one  side  of  the  coin,  while
psychological violence in the workplace is experienced as a  consequence  of
strike action. Although legal strikes are preceded by a vote count, not  all
workers who vote for a strike do so because they are voluntarily  in  favour
of such strike, for various personal reasons, such  as:  staying  away  from
one's workplace;  being  in  rowdy  mob  situations;  staying  under  police
surveillance every step of the way; living under the threat  of  being  with
or without pay; and shouting slogans and pacing the streets  and  pavements.
All of these actions haunt the mind and suffocate  one's  sense  of  dignity
and self-respect. One's psyche becomes impaired and disoriented.

For the first few weeks after the strike, relations with  management  become
strained. Performance and work efficiency  decrease  and  production  levels
fall below the mark. Psychological violence in the workplace is as  evil  as
physical violence in the workplace and situations leading to strike  actions
must be avoided by both workers and management. There is  no  better  choice
for production and the economy.

[Mrs T L P NWAMITWA-SHILUBANA (ANC): Madam Speaker, Mrs Johanna  Baloyi  was
awarded a BA degree in Communications by Unisa on 13 May  2003.  She  was  a
domestic worker for about 14  years  and  received  encouragement  from  her
employers, Mary and Bek Murray, to further her studies.  The  story  of  Mrs
Johanna Baloyi's achievements is  a  clear  indication  that  the  doors  of
learning have now been opened to all our people in the first decade  of  our
democracy.

The ANC Government has managed to transform education  so  that  people  who
were denied education opportunties in the past would  have  the  opportunity
to further their studies and  improve  their  quality  of  life.  All  South
Africans congratulate Mrs Baloyi on her achievement,  which  is  the  reward
for her hard work. As has already been said, these  achievements  illustrate
what has been done to eradicate the system of apartheid.

All South Africans should join hands to uproot all the causes of poverty  as
we move closer to the second decade of freedom. We also  wish  Mrs  Baloyi's
employers,  Mary  and  Bek  Murray,  who  supported  her  in  her   studies,
everything of  the  best  and  invite  other  employers  to  follow  in  the
footsteps of the Murrays.

We also encourage all employees to learn from what Mrs  Johanna  Baloyi  has

                     A NEW CONSTABULARY FOR SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr J SCHIPPERS (Nuwe  NP):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  na  aanleiding  van  die
President se aankondiging in sy openingsrede dat aandag  geskenk  gaan  word
aan die uitfasering  van  die  kommandostelsel  en  die  skep  van  'n  nuwe
stelsel, is groot kommer uitgespreek dat 'n sekuriteitsvakuum  in  landelike
gebiede voorkom moet word. Ná omvattende  navorsing  en  beraadslaging,  het
die Nuwe NP 'n beleidsvoorstel saamgestel en voorgelê aan die  Minister  van
Veiligheid en Sekuriteit, asook aan die Minister van Verdediging.  Die  Nuwe
NP het ook die kundigheid van 'n prominente lid van die SANW, Generaal  John
del Monte, gebruik om die beleid saam te stel.

 Gesien in die lig van die groot aantal plaasmoorde, spreek die Nuwe  NP  se
voorstel  van  'n  konstabelary  die  behoefte  aan  vir  'n   doeltreffende
landelike veiligheidsplan. Die Nuwe  NP  glo  dat  die  skep  van  'n  Suid-
Afrikaanse konstabelary 'n logiese, effektiewe en bekostigbare  antwoord  is
as  alternatief  vir  die  huidige  kommandostelsel.  Alle  Suid  Afrikaanse
konstabelary-eenhede en sekere ander eenhede sal toegerus  en  opgelei  word
vir beskermingswerk vir afgeleë gebiede in oorlogstyd. Die Nuwe NP hoop  dat
sy beleidsvoorstel  ook  sal  bydra  tot  'n  konstruktiewe  debat  met  die
Regering,  asook  die  transformasie  van  die  kommandostelsel.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS (New NP): Madam Speaker, as a result of the announcement  by
the President in his  opening  address  that  attention  must  be  given  to
phasing out the commando system and the development of a new  system,  great
concern was expressed that a security vacuum  arising  in  the  rural  areas
must  be  prevented.  The  New  NP  compiled   a   policy   proposal   after
comprehensive research and deliberation and submitted  it  to  the  Minister
for Safety and Security as well as the  Minister  of  Defence.  The  New  NP
utilised the expertise of a prominent member of the SANDF, General John  del
Monte, to draft the policy.

Viewed in the light of the large numbers of farm murders, the suggestion  by
the New NP for a constabulary addresses the  need  for  an  effective  rural
security plan. The New  NP  believes  that  the  establishment  of  a  South
African constabulary is a logical, effective and  affordable  answer  as  an
alternative to the current commando system. All South  African  constabulary
units and certain other units will be equipped and  trained  for  protection
work in remote areas during wartime.  The  New  NP  hopes  that  the  policy
proposal will also contribute to a constructive debate with the  Government,
as well as the transformation of the commando system. [Applause.]]

                         UTILISING BLACK TOUR GUIDES

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM:  Madam  Speaker,  in  the
statement by the hon Gwen  Mahlangu,  especially  the  part  in  Venda,  her
pronounciation was excellent for those of you who ... [Laughter.]

I want to say that we need to emphasise the point that  has  been  made.  In
spite of the massive growth in tourism, we  still  have  a  situation  where
most tour operators tend to use white tour guides. Now, the provinces,  over
the past year or so, have gone out of their way to train,  to  register  and
to accredit black tour guides, but we still find that  most  tour  operators
are not using black tour guides.

Not only is it wrong, but it is also bad for their  business,  because  when
visitors come from other parts of the world they want to be given  the  full
flavour of what this country has to offer and that can only be given  if  we
use these tour guides and the richness of South African society  in  all  of
its diversity.

I would like to make a special appeal to tour operators that they should  do
this. If they do not, then we are going to take a leaf out of  the  book  of
the Minister of Minerals and Energy  and  establish  a  quota,  and  she  is
already making a suggestion of a percentage  of  tour  guides  that  we  can
suggest. We find that 25% is too low for  us  as  far  as  tour  guides  are
concerned.

I hope that the Minister will  assist  me  in  doing  in  the  tour  guiding
industry what she has done with the gentlemen out there as well.
The SPEAKER: Are there any other Ministers who wish to  respond  -  but  not
add - to members' statements? [Laughter.]

                   INTERNATIONAL CANDLELIGHT MEMORIAL DAY

                               (Announcement)

There being none, before we proceed with the Order  Paper  I  wish  to  draw
members' attention to the fact that the Deputy  President  and  members  lit
candles earlier today in the foyer of the National  Assembly.  This  was  in
recognition of International Aids Candlelight Memorial Day, which  falls  on
Sunday, 18 May, when we honour the memory of those lost to Aids and we  show
support for  those  living  with  HIV/Aids.  The  occasion  also  serves  to
mobilise  communities   in   the   fight   against   HIV/Aids.   As   public
representatives we are required to be part of events and campaigns  such  as
this. I want to urge all members, therefore,  to  light  a  candle  in  your
constituency or wherever you are on Sunday 18 May as part of what is  now  a
global campaign. I believe it is the largest campaign at  grass-roots  level
against Aids.

        EXCHANGE CONTROL AMNESTY AND AMENDMENT OF TAXATION LAWS BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Hon members, it gives  me
great pleasure to introduce the Exchange Control Amnesty  and  Amendment  of
Taxation Laws Bill. The Bill has  benefited  immensely  from  the  extensive
deliberations by the Portfolio Committee on Finance and I'd  like  to  thank
Barbara Hogan for her able stewardship of this process.

It is heartening to realise that in terms of the tax policy design,  efforts
by the portfolio committee continue to  add  transparency  to  deliberations
that have reached a level of maturity envied by many other jurisdictions.

Government attaches great value to the contributions of the public,  further
enriching the Bill. Moreover, we believe that this Bill sets the  scene  for
an exciting period in which many South Africans  are  invited  to,  firstly,
take  this  opportunity  amidst  an  unfavourable   international   economic
climate, putting their trust and their funds into  this  economy;  secondly,
divulge their contravention of exchange control regulations and certain  tax
Acts, thereby regularising their affairs in respect of foreign-held  assets;
thirdly, disclose  their  foreign  assets  amidst  Government's  efforts  to
facilitate the repatriation thereof; and fourthly, extend the  tax  base  by
disclosing previously unreported foreign assets.

Despite the existence of exchange controls, many South  African  individuals
and entities have a long history of shifting assets offshore illegally in  a
variety of ways.  The  foreign  income  from  these  assets  typically  goes
unreported in terms of certain tax Acts. Government has  rightly  taken  the
position that contraventions of exchange control regulations and tax  should
not be tolerated. However, in recent years it has become apparent that  many
individuals and  entities  wish  to  repatriate  their  foreign-held  assets
voluntarily and regularise their affairs due to  greater  international  co-
operation  in  tax  compliance  efforts   and   enhanced   surveillance   of
international capital flows. Furthermore, the  recent  promulgation  of  the
Financial Intelligence Centre Act has further increased the risk of  holding
illegal foreign assets.

Internationally, the legal and economic environment  has  also  become  less
favourable for illegally held foreign  assets.  Since  1994  Government  has
greatly expanded  its  tax  treaty  network,  thereby  facilitating  greater
international information exchange.  The  world  community  is  increasingly
intolerant of tax haven countries and  has  reinforced  measures  to  combat
illegal money-laundering. Finally, the current state of  the  world  economy
indicates that the growth prospects of foreign earnings are less  attractive
in comparison to earning opportunities of onshore investments.

The exchange control amnesty  Bill  contains  provisions  that  allow  South
African residents to disclose their foreign assets held in contravention  of
exchange control regulations and certain tax  Acts.  Disclosure  will  allow
residents to exonerate and regularise their exchange control and income  tax
affairs at minimal cost. The amnesty procedures  are  as  follows.  Firstly,
any South African resident natural person, including the deceased estate  of
a person, a close corporation  or  trust,  may  apply  for  amnesty  relief.
Secondly, amnesty applicants may apply from 1 June this year through  to  30
November this year. Thirdly, the exchange control amnesty  will  only  apply
to individuals and entities that voluntarily come  forward;  those  who  are
already under investigation  by  the  authorities  involving  their  foreign
assets are precluded from the amnesty  process.  Fourthly,  the  application
must be filed in the form of an affidavit or solemn  declaration  and,  most
importantly,  the  applicant  must  also  affirm  that  the  foreign  assets
disclosed do not stem from any unlawful activity,  except  exchange  control
and tax law violations or any associated misrepresentation or  nondisclosure
in respect of these violations. Individuals or entities engaged in  criminal
activities such as drug smuggling, money-laundering  and  terrorism  do  not
fall within this amnesty.

The exchange control amnesty will apply only to  disclosed  foreign  assets,
while nondisclosed assets  remain  fully  subject  to  potential  civil  and
criminal  prosecution.  The  disclosure  of  a  foreign  asset  requires   a
statement of that asset's market value as of 28 February  this  year  and  a
full description of identifying characteristics. The amnesty  for  disclosed
foreign assets attracts an amnesty levy of 5% of the fair  market  value  of
the repatriated foreign assets. A 10% levy  will  apply  to  the  stated  28
February 2003 market value  of  nonrepatriated  assets,  minus  a  R750  000
exchange control permissible foreign investment  allowance.  In  respect  of
exchange control, finally, the amnesty levy must be paid from assets  within
three months.

In respect of tax relief for the  nondisclosure  of  foreign  earnings,  the
following procedure applies. Firstly, individuals and closely held  entities
who fail to disclose foreign receipts and accruals arising  in  the  taxable
year ending on or before 28 February 2002 may separately apply  for  amnesty
relief in this regard  even  if  those  applicants  did  not  simultaneously
violate exchange control regulations.  Secondly,  the  related  tax  amnesty
relief for failure to disclose receipts and accruals of foreign assets  will
only be granted if there is full disclosure of the receipts and accruals  of
that foreign asset arising after the 28 February 2002 cutoff date.  Thirdly,
successful applicants are not liable for  any  income  tax  payment  or  any
associated criminal offence with respect to disclosed foreign assets.

In  respect  of  tax  relief  for  the  nondisclosure  of   domestic   funds
transferred offshore, firstly, this amnesty will  also  cover  domestic  tax
transgressions, but  only  to  the  extent  that  these  transgressions  are
related to foreign assets.  Secondly,  applicants  must  also  disclose  the
amount and date of foreign  assets  shifted  offshore.  The  amnesty  for  a
domestic tax violation comes at the price of a domestic amnesty levy  of  2%
of undisclosed amounts. Thirdly, with a view to protecting tax  morality  in
respect of compliant taxpayers, the domestic  tax  amnesty  will  not  cover
other tax violations such  as  VAT,  PAYE,  the  skills  levy,  Unemployment
Insurance Fund and the Regional Services  Council  levy.  These  taxes  have
been excluded from the amnesty because violations  of  this  kind  typically
involve serious fiduciary violations such as the wrongful use of Pay As  You
Earn from employee salaries and wages.

The amnesty does not generally  apply  to  advisers  and  facilitators  that
merely assisted applicants in violating  exchange  control  regulations  and
related tax Acts. However, concerns were expressed during the hearings  that
advisers and facilitators need some level of protection.  It  was  contended
that advisers and facilitators  may  attempt  to  dissuade  applicants  from
coming forward out of fear that an  applicant's  request  for  amnesty  will
lead to the prosecution of these advisers and facilitators. On the basis  of
further careful  consideration  by  Government,  the  Bill  was  revised  to
provide  coverage  for   advisers   and   facilitators   by   limiting   the
investigating powers of both the SA Revenue Service and  the  Reserve  Bank.
The amnesty unit, Sars and  the  Reserve  Bank  therefore  cannot  force  an
amnesty applicant to disclose the identity of any party that assisted  in  a
violation. In addition, the amnesty unit will erase  all  names  of  parties
inadvertently revealed by the applicant on an application form.

With this level of protection, no reason  exists  to  generally  extend  the
amnesty for advisers and facilitators as no names will be requested  and  no
names should be revealed. However, the only extension of amnesty involves  a
limited class of facilitators, which are  parties  who  physically  assisted
the violations - the ``schnorrers'', those who carried the money out.  These
facilitators include individuals such  as  trustees  and  employees,  wholly
owned companies and  trusts  that  illegally  held  or  accumulated  foreign
assets on the applicant's behalf. These related parties need an extra  level
of protection because the SA Revenue  Service  and  the  Reserve  Bank  will
automatically have an investigation trail to these related parties once  the
applicant discloses the need for amnesty.

Such facilitators  may  apply  for  relief  by  adding  their  names  to  an
applicant's application for amnesty. In other words, a facilitator may  only
come forward if the related applicant files an amnesty application.

The Bill will require the establishment of an independent amnesty  unit  for
processing the applications. An independent chairperson  will  be  appointed
shortly and the unit will contain personnel from both the Reserve  Bank  and
the SA Revenue  Service.  The  unit  will  terminate  after  processing  all
successful  applications  and  after  all   unsuccessful   applicants   have
exhausted their  appeals.  The  draft  legislation  also  provides  for  the
issuance of speedy guidance  through  regulations  that  address  unintended
consequences.  The  amnesty  unit  can  only  make  successful  applications
available to the SA Revenue Service and the Reserve Bank so that  applicants
receive the desired amnesty protection.

Both the Reserve Bank and the SA Revenue Service  must  provide  information
about the amnesty to the Minister of Finance so that the Minister can  fully
report on the progress of the amnesty to Parliament. This  information  will
ensure that the amnesty is conducted in a transparent and  accountable  way.
The Bill also contains a provision expediting and regulating  the  efficient
exchange of information flows between the Reserve Bank and  the  SA  Revenue
Service.  These  measures  will  promote  future  enhanced  enforcement   of
exchange control and taxation laws in terms  of  foreign  assets,  providing
yet another reason for South Africans to grab the opportunities provided  by
this amnesty.

In addition, the Exchange Control Amnesty and  Amendment  of  Taxation  Laws
Bill contains miscellaneous amendments to certain tax Acts as  announced  in
the 2003 Budget Review. These adjustments entail personal income tax  rates,
income brackets and exemption thresholds.  The  Bill  also  removes  certain
duties. These amendments further impose a secondary tax  on  companies  when
domestic companies  shift  their  tax  residence  status  offshore,  thereby
preventing artificial capital outflows.

I have great pleasure in hereby tabling the  Exchange  Control  Amnesty  and
Amendment of Taxation Laws Bill, 2003. I thank you.

Bill, together with the introductory speech, referred for consideration  and
report to the Portfolio Commitee on Finance.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                 Debate on Vote No 31 - Minerals and Energy:

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Madam Speaker, hon members,  Ministers,
guests sitting over there  in  the  public  gallery,  I  want  to  start  by
apologising unreservedly for the gifts that were distributed in the  Chamber
without permission. I appeal to members to please declare those gifts.
The year under review was a very significant  year  for  the  Department  of
Minerals and Energy. We made ground-breaking progress. We  faced  challenges
and we also had setbacks. It was a year of great service  by  the  officials
of my department and our parastatals also  excelled  in  their  fields.  Our
relations   with   stakeholders   were   enhanced   through   disagreements,
engagements and agreements. As the DME, our vision is  that  of  sustainable
development and  growth  through  minerals  and  energy  resources  for  the
benefit of all South Africans.  This  vision  is  also  located  within  the
struggle of pushing back the frontiers of poverty. Our  work  for  the  year
now ending, which I will present, should be seen in that context.

Let me give members a snap view of our year 2002-03, even if it is  only  of
the highlights. Today, we are wearing these hard  hats  in  order  to  drive
home the message of safety first. I am glad that members are joining  us  in
that campaign. We commissioned  a  mine  health  and  safety  review,  which
focused on the implementation of the Mine Health and Safety Act of 1996  and
subsequent regulations, and on identifying gaps and  required  actions.  The
Deputy Minister will elaborate on the outcome of that process.

Our Mining Qualifications Authority, or MQA, enabled young people  to  study
for tertiary qualifications in  mining  through  awarding  a  total  of  135
scholarships mainly to previously disadvantaged persons.  As  we  speak,  29
students have just been offered an opportunity to go and  study  in  France.
All of them will be doing postgraduate studies in nuclear-related  sciences.
All of them are sponsored by Areva, a company which is in  partnership  with
us in the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor programme. [Applause.]

Last  year,  the  President  signed  the  Mineral  and  Petroleum  Resources
Development Act of 2002 and the stakeholders  also  signed  the  Broad-based
Socioeconomic Empowerment Charter. That was a real highlight and  a  special
moment for us. Government, industry, labour, community  representatives  and
junior miners travelled around the world together in order to explain  South
Africa's mining reforms. I would  like  to  thank  the  stakeholders  for  a
sterling job.

We hosted a mining week  alongside  the  Electra  Mining  exhibition,  which
enabled stakeholders and all interested parties to engage  us  in  different
aspects of our mining industry and the  reforms  that  we  are  undertaking.
During that time, we also launched a beneficiation project  which  is  based
at Mintek and is called Kgabane. It trains women  in  jewellery  making.  We
hosted a successful HIV/Aids mining summit  that  involved  stakeholders.  I
would like to congratulate our Deputy Minister for his  sterling  leadership
in organising and co-ordinating that conference. [Applause.]

We merged two of our upstream gas and oil assets,  Soekor  and  Mossgas,  to
form one company, a state  oil  company  called  PetroSA.  This  company  is
giving us value. We completed a draft White Paper on  renewable  energy  and
at the WSSD we were able to commit our country to  cleaner  energy  sources.
We are now developing further policies in  order  for  us  to  take  further
those decisions that we have taken.
We finished  the  long-awaited  integrated  energy  plan  and  it  has  been
confirmed scientifically that in South Africa we need to ensure that we  use
all energy sources optimally: nuclear, coal, gas, oil and renewable  energy.
We also launched two integrated energy centres in order  for  us  to  assist
poor households by bringing down the cost of energy. Through  these  centres
we are able to provide information and education to poor households.

We successfully procured strategic stock for the country  -  using  a  black
economic empowerment company - to the value  of  US$87  000  million  and  a
total of 3,5 million barrels of crude oil. We  trained  61  interns  in  our
department and we were able to provide an opportunity and skills  for  young
people.  All  of  that  helped  push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  We
electrified 338 572 homes, 974 schools and 49 clinics, and 5 321 solar  home
systems were installed. That  is  a  3%  increase  on  last  year.  In  this
programme, together with Eskom, we continue to perform exceptionally well.

Our PBMR programme has also advanced. We will soon be  finishing  the  phase
that we are in. That phase will usher in a new phase, that is  the  building
of the model. A  decision  by  Cabinet  will  be  taken  after  all  of  the
outstanding information has been presented by us.

Together with interested parties, women in particular,  we  also  worked  to
launch two institutions aimed at supporting women:  the  Women  in  Oil  and
Energy South Africa, and the South  African  Women  in  Mining  Association,
Sawima. Both of them will be  further  assisted  by  us  and  our  director-
general will make an announcement on this matter.

We completed a free basic energy policy plan that we also  piloted  together
with Eskom. We are now ready to implement it to a minimum  of  500  families
in the qualifying areas and it will begin from July 2003. We  completed  the
pilot phase that started in 1999 in the  technical  support  of  small-scale
miners. We have identified projects that  we  are  now  taking  forward  and
which already employ 300 people, 66% of whom are women.

We have established a monitoring team to evaluate the sustainability of  the
oil deals in liquid fuels and the validity of the BEE groups. That  work  is
ongoing. We embarked on a human resource strategy that cuts across  all  the
areas that we work with, working together with the energy Seta,  Chieta  and
MQA. We also launched a publication called Molato, which provides  news  and
views on Government and the stakeholders about our industry.

We led the Kimberley process, which was aimed at  stopping  trade  in  blood
diamonds, to its logical conclusion. There is  evidence  of  a  decrease  in
blood diamonds in the market. Sierra Leone,  for  instance,  is  a  case  in
point. With the assistance  and  support  of  the  United  Nations  we  have
created an enforceable  regime  that  is  binding  on  the  world's  diamond
industry and approximately 70 countries, and the list is  growing.  I  would
like to thank Abe Chikane, who is the chairman of the Kimberley process.  He
has done our country proud.
We completed the process that will kickstart the restructuring of  the  EDI.
Miss Phindi Nzimande has been appointed as  CEO  of  EDI  Holdings  and  the
board has also been appointed. The budget is in place, the plan is in  place
and so are the time lines. The EDI process is earnestly ready to start  with
implementation. A forum of foreign investors in mining  was  also  launched.
It is a unique body through which we can consult foreign investors. It  also
confirms a long-term agenda with regard to our country by  members  of  this
body.

That has been a snapshot of some of the things  that  we  did  in  the  year
under review. For 2002-03, we used 99% of our allocated budget.  Of  our  R1
872 618 we were able to spend, as I have said, 99%. Regarding the  MTEF,  as
we move forward to 2003-04, our funds seem to be decreasing.  But,  we  have
to note that the decrease in the department's allocation is  mainly  due  to
the decrease in the provision for the redemption of Necsa loans, which  will
start in 2004-05. That information is  on  Programme  5  on  the  associated
bodies page.

In effect, our allocation has increased. This is due  to  the  expansion  of
the department as a result of the increase in the work that we have  to  do.
The minerals sector,  in  the  year  under  review,  also  performed  in  an
interesting way. We were pleasantly surprised to see  that  the  preliminary
figures showed that there was a 1,5% rise in  employment  from  407  154  in
2001 to 413 087 in 2002 - the first recorded increase since 1986.

Earnings in platinum also surpassed gold earnings for the first time in  100
years. Yet, in 2002 gold reclaimed its dominance. Having said that, we  also
need to highlight the fact that even with the greater  value  addition  that
we are beginning to see in the industry, South Africa continues to export  a
very high proportion of its raw materials. Part of our reforms are aimed  at
addressing that.

Undoubtedly, a major event in 2002-03 was the signing  of  the  Mineral  and
Petroleum Resources Development  Act  by  the  President,  as  well  as  the
stakeholders' signing of the charter. Reforms have taken us  over  10  years
and they have been  driven  by  the  ANC  Government  through  engaging  the
stakeholders. The last of the legislative processes aimed at  advancing  our
mining reforms will be the legislation on beneficiation. After that,  kuyobe
kugqitshiwe [everything would have been finalised],  because  we  will  have
passed a package of legislation  aimed  at  truly  transforming  our  mining
industry. We will also appoint an advisory board which will  work  with  the
Minister and the department to implement  these  changes.  A  shortlist  has
been provided and it will soon be taken to Cabinet for approval.

I would like to encourage all  those  who  are  engaged  and  interested  in
mining to start testing the validity of their transactions,  especially  the
new transactions, against the scoreboard. This will enable  both  of  us  to
start quite early in addressing any of the challenges that their  deals  may
face which may lead to their not being able  to  fast-track  the  conversion
from the old order rights to new order rights.

We are also introducing a new dispensation for the  junior  and  small-scale
miners, as a result of which a directorate for small-scale mining  is  being
established in my department. We also have the  mining  social  plan,  which
includes  specific  social  plan  processes  to   manage   downscaling   and
retrenchments in the mining industry.

Regarding energy matters, in the  coming  year  we  will  see  a  much  more
intense focus on energy matters. In accordance with the  conclusion  of  the
integrated energy plan, the gas industry has a critical role to play in  our
future energy mix. Gas sales, just with  Sasol,  are  already  expanding  at
approximately 10% to 12% per  annum.  This  House  passed  the  Gas  Act  to
promote the orderly development of the piped gas industry,  to  establish  a
national regulatory framework and to establish a National Gas  Regulator  as
the custodian and enforcer of the national regulatory framework.

A  gas  infrastructure  has  been  developed.  It  addresses  the   reserves
infrastructure,  market  and  development  plans.  The  plans  envisage  the
following: a national and regional gas transmission network from Namibia  to
Cape Town and around the coast to Mossel Bay, Coega  and  Durban;  from  the
West Coast through  Sishen  to  Gauteng;  and  the  existing  pipeline  from
Gauteng to Richards Bay and Durban, as well as the pipeline currently  under
construction from Mozambique to Secunda. This  will  complete  another  grid
that will overlay the already  well-established  grids  that  we  have  from
Eskom, which we use for transmitting our electricity.

South Africa also remains an energy-intensive economy with  a  challenge  as
far as pollution is concerned. Yet, relatively straightforward and  low-cost
measures on energy efficiency could yield savings in a short space of  time.
My department has led the way by installing  energy-efficient  lighting  and
hopes to roll this out  to  other  departments.  It  is  estimated  that  my
department will save a whopping R97 000 per annum,  just  by  improving  the
gadgets that we are using in our department.  We  would  like  to  encourage
many of our citizens, both  in  the  private  sector  and  in  the  domestic
environment, to address this issue.
South Africa will also see some of the changes  in  the  energy  environment
arising from the provisions of the energy Bill, and one of the  hon  members
will expatiate on this matter.

Another big energy project in the electricity sector in the coming year,  as
I indicated earlier on, is going to be EDI -  the  electricity  distribution
industry. This industry is worth R30 billion and employs more  than  30  000
personnel. It is, therefore, very significant for  the  country.  It  should
enable us to address the issue of equity so that our people who  are  poorer
do not pay more money, to create universal  access  by  the  year  2010,  to
establish affordability and avoid unreasonable increases, and  to  encourage
growth in the economy.

All the work has been done to demarcate the  six  new  regional  electricity
distributors, or REDs. These REDs will own the distribution  business,  part
of which currently falls under Eskom. While a  progressive  rise  in  energy
prices cannot be avoided, South Africa still  intends  to  keep  electricity
prices low.
The Department of Minerals and Energy shares the concern of the Minister  of
Public Enterprises on the need for the National  Electricity  Regulator  and
Eskom always to operate within our macroeconomic framework and to  stick  to
justifiable increases. Therefore, we'll support the need  by  Government  to
review how regulated prices are arrived at. We will also  pay  attention  to
maintenance  in  the  coming  year  in  order  to  ensure  that  we  utilise
unemployed people by training them so that they can play a greater  role  in
the maintenance of our energy.

In November last year the Southern African Power Pool was officially  opened
in Harare. The Southern  African  Power  Pool  is  an  energy  market  where
Southern African utilities trade in electricity. It  provides  South  Africa
with a unique opportunity to diversify its energy mix, as some of the  power
traded is hydro-generated. Progress in energy trading has increased  on  the
short-term energy market, and the managed liberalisation  of  these  markets
is being discussed.

We have also become part of the African regulators,  and  I  would  like  to
congratulate our own National Electricity Regulator, who  has  been  elected
as the first chairperson  of  this  worthy  initiative  which  advances  the
interests of Nepad.

Some of the highlights, as far as our parastatals are concerned,  include  a
project  and  initiative  undertaken  by  Mintek  and  Harmony   Gold.   The
initiative, called Musuku Beneficiation  Systems,  is  an  alliance  between
Harmony Gold, which took the pioneering step of establishing  its  own  gold
refinery in the small Free State town  of  Virginia  in  1997,  and  Mintek,
South Africa's national  minerals  research  organisation.  The  partnership
combines Harmony Gold's existing refinery and  gold  beneficiation  business
with Mintek's capabilities  in  advanced  technology,  and  the  design  and
construction of refining and manufacturing facilities. This deal  will  also
make it possible for a 20% shareholding by an empowerment partner  who  will
soon be announced.

The future of the Central Energy Fund and the Strategic Fuel Fund  is  under
review. Some of the work that was done by the Strategic Fuel  Fund  has  now
been undertaken on contract by PetroSA. We will,  at  an  appropriate  time,
announce the changes as far as this institution is concerned.

The year under review also saw the completion of a 25-year project in  which
a metallogenic map of the African continent was produced under the  auspices
of the Commission for the  Geological  Map  of  the  World.  The  map  is  a
significant South African offering to the Nepad programme. Our  own  Council
for Geoscience was the one which  was  responsible  for  this  project.  The
Council for Geoscience was also proud to  be  associated  with  the  planned
Freedom  Park  Monument  in  Pretoria,   by   undertaking   the   geological
engineering site investigation.

Petroleum Agency South Africa is the designated agent for  the  Mineral  and
Petroleum Resources Development Act to  promote  oil  exploration  in  South
Africa. And again, this institution has done a lot  of  work  this  year  in
positioning South Africa and its oil production and reserves.

There has also been a lot of focus on the rural  nodes.  The  department  is
expediting access to energy among the poorest of the poor. As a  result,  in
the coming  year  it  is  planned  that  up  to  51%  of  our  resources  on
electrification will go to the nodal areas.

PetroSA will be facing changes in the coming year.  Last  year,  it  paid  a
handsome dividend to the Treasury - I'm sorry the Minister has  gone  -  and
we are very proud of the work they continue to do.  One  of  the  challenges
they are going to face next year will deal with having to enter  the  retail
sector.

The same challenge will be facing Sasol. As Government, we will do all  that
we can to ensure that, whatever choices PetroSA makes in this regard,  these
will enhance the market and improve the accessibility  of  liquid  fuels  to
our poor communities.

I have commissioned an evaluation of my  department  by  stakeholders.  That
study will assist us so  as  to:  assess  the  quality  of  the  service  we
deliver; evaluate the impact and affordability of services to  the  poorest;
determine areas of improvement; assess the  department's  accessibility  and
turnaround time; hear the perspective of users and stakeholders;  and  gauge
the values of the Department of Minerals and Energy, including  Batho  Pele.
The outcome of this evaluation will enable us to measure  our  effectiveness
and, therefore, take the appropriate action.

Our co-operation with organised labour reached a very high  level.  We  were
awarded a much-valued award by the  NUM  called  Kgau  Ya  Bahale.  By  this
gesture, the workers expressed their appreciation of our efforts and we  are
humbled and moved beyond words. [Applause.] For me, the Deputy Minister  and
the department this award has only pushed the threshold of service  delivery
even higher.

I would like to thank all our partners, the portfolio  committee  and  their
chairperson for their meaningful contribution and  dedication,  demonstrated
beyond doubt  during  the  time  of  the  Mineral  and  Petroleum  Resources
Development Bill. I would also like to thank the  Deputy  Minister  and  the
director-general for their leadership, as well as the members of our  boards
and chief executive officers. I also want to bid farewell to Dr  Frick,  who
will not be here in the same capacity next year in this Budget Vote,  but  I
hope he will be here anyway.

I would like to ensure hon members of this House that the work that  we  are
doing in pushing back the frontiers of poverty in South  Africa  is  one  of
the critical ways in which we advance our vision. I would  like  to  believe
that pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  is  a  shared  vision.  Our
stakeholders are buying into this vision. It is a shared vision  beyond  the
Department of Minerals and Energy. There has to be a continuous creation  of
this vision in every individual who is part of  our  organisation  so  that,
like our fallen heroes as epitomised by Tata Walter Sisulu, they  will  each
be self-propelled by this vision.
The Rivonia trialists  were  willing  to  die  for  us.  And,  as  has  been
mentioned, according to Tata Walter Sisulu, they were willing to go  to  the
gallows singing, so that future generations could be inspired. For this,  we
need to ensure that we work even harder and  display  much  more  commitment
and courage so that we can truly deliver on the new South Africa that  we've
promised our people. [Applause.]

Mr I O DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr Chairman. Within  the  limited  time  I  have
available, I want to focus on two issues, which I  hope  the  Minister  will
respond to in the course of the debate.

The first is the very damning  report  of  the  Auditor-General  on  the  SA
Diamond Board for the  year  2001-02.  The  report,  quite  frankly,  was  a
disgrace and one of the worst reports I  have  ever  seen  of  a  department
published by the Auditor-General.

Points raised by the Auditor-General include: cash flow  problems;  accuracy
of revenue and debtors; completeness, validity and  accuracy  of  the  fixed
assets  disclosed;  accuracy  of  the  value-added  tax  figure   disclosed;
irregular expenditure by the CEO; problems regarding income  tax  deductions
from the CEO; problems in  respect  of  the  management  of  the  board,  in
particular  internal  control  and  the  nonfunctioning  of  the   auditor's
committee; the nonapproval by the board of the Minister's budget  for  2001-
02; pointless expenditure; legal actions, and there was a lot of  that;  and
the suspension of the CEO. Many other points were also raised.

This litany of problems indicated first and foremost that the board  was  in
a mess. And, quite frankly, this is an indictment of  the  Minister  and  of
that department. Now the Minister is aware of the fact that for some time  I
have expressed an interest in the activities of the  SA  Diamond  Board  and
many of the questions I asked centred around the very points raised  by  the
Auditor-General. To many of these questions the Minister's reply was  either
inadequate, incomplete or purely evasive.

The Minister  will  recall  that  my  questions  go  back  to  the  Taljaard
investigation, which reported in May 2000 and which highlighted problems  in
the  board,  especially  the  problems  of  corporate  governance.   Certain
recommendations  were  made  and  it   was   my   information   that   these
recommendations were not carried out. No wonder we  are  in  the  mess  that
we're in. I communicated this to the Minister, but she  refused  to  believe
me.

I am very pleased that the chairman, CEO and diamond evaluator are now  gone
and that under the new chairman, Mr Abe Chikane, matters have improved,  and
improved considerably.

It is worth recording that when the SA Diamond Board appeared at my  request
before a rather supine portfolio committee, many  of  the  problems  of  the
board were blamed by the past CEO on  the  nature  and  composition  of  the
board itself, which he claimed was dysfunctional, as result  of  conflicting
agendas and gatekeeping in  respect  of  special  interests.  This  line  of
reasoning both the Minister and the portfolio  committee  seemed  to  accept
with alacrity.
Of course, the private sector was an easy target to blame. When I  asked  Mr
Abe Chikane on a very recent visit to the  portfolio  committee  whether  he
also was of this view, his answer was somewhat different and  he  tended  to
agree with me that the real root of the problem was, in fact,  the  CEO  and
the diamond evaluator.

Now this brings me to the real point which I want  to  address,  namely  the
accountability of the Minister in circumstances such  as  this  and  matters
such as the Central Energy Fund debacle.

The Minister  has  always  insisted,  and  it  is  evidenced  in  pieces  of
legislation that have come before this House, that  she  has  the  right  to
appoint boards, chairpersons and chief executive officers  of  organisations
falling under her auspices, including the  SA  Diamond  Board,  the  Central
Energy Fund and the various regulators.

I want to put it to the Minister that with rights come responsibilities  and
with responsibilities comes accountability. And you have to accept that.  Is
it appropriate, when debacles occur  such  as  what  happened  with  the  SA
Diamond Board and with the Central Energy Fund, that she does not  share  in
that accountability? And I want the Minister to answer that.

Now the second issue that needs to be addressed pertains to  reports  of  an
agreement announced on 13 April 2003 between Eskom, Sanco and other  unnamed
parties with regard to the write-off of R1,4 billion in arrears  in  certain
areas of greater Johannesburg. While the DA is not opposed to general write-
offs, where appropriate, it is opposed to selective write-offs as  a  result
of backdoor deals done with certain pressure groups. If there are  going  to
be write-offs, these should be  a  result  of  a  thorough  national  debate
resulting in a comprehensive policy on  debt  write-offs  and  a  system  of
rates  that  provides  free  basic  services  to  benefit  the  poorest   of
households.

This write-off as announced discriminates  beween  poor  and  poor,  between
poor black consumers in certain areas and poor black  consumers  in  others,
between certain poor black consumers and  poor  coloured,  poor  Indian  and
poor white consumers. This is fundamentally  unfair,  because  the  problems
faced by those who have  been  the  recipients  of  the  write-offs  are  no
different to the problems faced by others who have not received this  write-
off.

What of the communities of Ivory Park  and  Diepsloot  in  Johannesburg?  Or
Temba and Hammanskraal in Tshwane? And  Khayelitsha,  Nyanga,  Bishop  Lavis
and Uitsig in Cape Town? All of these areas are directly supplied  by  Eskom
and yet they were not privy to the write-off.

I am aware of the service  delivery  payment  which  launched  the  process,
resulting in the write-off. The process, however, seems  totally  inadequate
and the results flawed and not properly thought through. No plan exists  for
the extension of the write-offs to other parts of the country and  certainly
no justification is given for focusing on the central region in Gauteng.

Certainly, the plan contravenes the  National  Electricity  Regulator's  own
draft policy in respect  of  write-offs.  This  document  is  clear  in  its
adherence to the principle of nondiscrimination. I quote:


  When a supplier offers a negotiated price agreement to a customer  within
  a industry/sector, the supplier has to be willing to offer  the  same  to
  another customer of the same profile.

This has not been done. I  also  believe  that  such  selective  write-offs,
based on geography and race and  a  refusal  to  offer  similiar  relief  to
others, could constitute  a  fundamental  violation  of  the  provisions  of
equality and procedural fairness  in  the  Constitution,  and  could  render
Eskom liable to legal action.

What also intrigues me is that  this  write-off  also  directly  contravenes
Eskom's own stated policy in respect of write-offs. In fact, they  had  only
set aside R153 million for write-offs,  but  this  write-off  is  almost  10
times that amount.
The DA is neither satisfied with the process leading to the write-offs,  nor
its selective outcome. The only fair, rational  and  constitutionally  sound
write-off policy is  one  which  is  pro  rata  and  open  to  all  eligible
households supplied by Eskom, regardless of race or geography.

We have interacted with the Minister of Public Enterprises and the  Minister
should indeed be directly involved in this, because it is, in fact, part  of
her portfolio. We do not believe Government should be for a select  few  who
shout the loudest. We believe Government should be for  all  the  people.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, it  is  appropriate
for me, before I say anything, to mention on this particular  day  we  would
like to send our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved Sisulu family  during
this wake period in preparation for the funeral of the late  Comrade  Walter
Sisulu, scheduled for this Saturday.

I would like to take us through the period of our  financial  year  2002-03,
which was a fruitful one for the Department of Minerals and Energy.  I  know
that there are those who oppose everything we say, like the speaker who  has
just left the podium, but be that as it may, the department intends  forging
ahead on the right path so as to ensure  that  our  resources  are  employed
fruitfully and responsibly to benefit all South Africa.

In my speech I will dwell on some of the issues touched on by the  Minister,
but this time elaborately. I will highlight some of the achievements of  the
past financial year. Fresh in our minds is the  successful  HIV/Aids  mining
summit, which we held together with employers in  the  mining  industry  and
organised labour at Gallagher Estate on 13 April 2003.

The tripartite alliance signed a declaration of intent on  the  day  of  the
mining summit. Contained therein is the following. It acknowledges that  the
HIV/Aids epidemic affects society at every level; the HIV/Aids epidemic  has
far-reaching social and economic implications which have not yet been  fully
quantified; the HIV/Aids epidemic demands a comprehensive, co-ordinated  and
united response to be defeated; and poverty eradication plays a  significant
role in combating HIV/Aids.

The summit accepted the comprehensive strategy developed by Government.  The
mining sector prides itself on pioneering a role in establishing  proactive,
comprehensive multistakeholder responses to the management of  HIV/Aids.  As
a way forward, the tripartite and HIV/Aids committee has to co-ordinate  and
combat HIV/Aids in the mining industry. Time lines were set to  ensure  that
implementation of this declaration of intent  takes  place.  The  department
has made and continues to come up with some interventions in  an  effort  to
combat the disease. Our infected and affected  workers  and  their  families
enjoy our continuous warm support and care.  Those  in  the  department  who
have to disclose their  status  are  provided  with  supplements  and  enjoy
regular home visits, hospital visits and referrals by our officials.

I need to take you through mine health  and  safety.  The  Mine  Health  and
Safety Inspectorate has completed the following inquiries into a  number  of
major accidents. Firstly, the one  at  Hartebeesfontein  which  occurred  in
1997; secondly, Mponeng, which occurred in 1999; and thirdly,  great  Ligwa,
which  happened  in  2002.  The   inspectorate   submits   its   report   on
Hartebeesfontein  and  great  Ligwa  to  the  Department  of   Justice   and
Constitutional  Development.  The  inspectorate  is  currently  compiling  a
report on Mponeng for submission to that department. Currently, the  inquiry
into the Beatrix disaster of 2000 is under way. It will be followed  by  the
2001 Beatrix disaster.

It is notable that  the  review  of  the  mining  industry  and  the  mining
inspectorate was conducted to comply with  the  Minister's  request  for  an
independent review on mine health and safety to assist the  inspectorate  in
developing an appropriate approach to transformation and  service  delivery,
and to inform the national initiative to integrate the  occupational  health
and safety inspectorate. The review has recommended  that  the  inspectorate
consider a number of changes in  structure  and  approach,  specifically  to
establish a policy unit, to increase the number of inspectors in the  field,
to develop the outlook and  expertise  of  inspectors,  and  to  develop  an
effective and standardised approach to enforcement  and  to  the  tripartite
system.

The reviewers observed that the major reason for the overall improvement  of
the occupational safety results for the mining sector is the contraction  of
the gold mining sector.  The  reviewers  further  concluded  that  gold  and
platinum mines, particularly the former,  should  implement  more  stringent
measures to protect the health and safety of workers, given the  high  level
of risk associated with them.

I would like to touch upon some of the critical issues which form  the  core
of our environment. I will touch firstly  on  the  area  of  rehabilitation.
Rehabilitation of ownerless and derelict asbestos mines has  always  been  a
high priority for us. The  department  has,  during  the  past  year,  spent
almost R17 million on the rehabilitation of derelict and ownerless  asbestos
mines across the country.

In all these projects public participation programmes have ensured that  the
communities affected by asbestos  pollution  are  kept  informed  about  the
projects. They have been given the opportunity to raise their  concerns  and
also the right information to ensure their safety.  On  a  practical  level,
the current tender allocations and the structures that  we  have  to  ensure
that black economic  empowerment  initiatives  are  brought  on  board  will
ensure that we are able to implement the policy that  has  been  adopted  by
our Government.

We  are  currently  rehabilitating  the  following  areas.  In  Limpopo   we
rehabilitated Voorspoed, which is one of the areas affected by asbestos.  We
have allocated about R3 million to R6  million  for  the  rehabilitation  of
this area, because it is affecting the communities in the  area.  The  other
area is Koegas, where we have spent R260 000 to ensure  that  we  attend  to
the rehabilitation of this area. We are also  rehabilitating  the  areas  of
Ncweng, Gamopedi, and Sardinia mine dumps in various places to  ensure  that
we meet our obligation as the Department of Minerals and Energy  in  various
provinces to ensure that we create a safe environment for our communities.

I would also briefly like to inform you that mine  environmental  management
has identified the following national priorities for  us  as  a  department:
the strengthening of enforcement in order to prevent  mining  legacies  from
happening;  the   identification   of   mine   pollution   hot   spots   and
implementation of additional measures, norms and standards;  addressing  and
managing the pollution problems within those areas; and  the  rehabilitation
of mine legacies of the past.

In order to facilitate the implementation of the three  national  priorities
for the mine environmental management, as a department we have  adopted  the
Phepafatso strategy, which is currently being finalised.  This  strategy  is
not only a departmental initiative, but it intends to ensure that there  are
co-operative Government  initiatives  which  are  supported  by  the  mining
industry, various parastatals, organisations and other role-players.

I would like to take us through the area of energy. As a department we  have
made every effort to make the lives of our people better,  especially  those
who are disadvantaged and vulnerable citizens in our country. To  be  blunt,
I need to talk about the African child and woman. The African child has  not
been able to compete in this hard field of science. To date, access  to  new
scientific  technologies  has   always   remained   elusive.   At   tertiary
institutions  some  non-African  students  take  notes  during  lectures  by
employing the latest technology available, such as laptops. This  cannot  be
said of the African child. To this  end,  the  Department  of  Minerals  and
Energy has consciously decided to help the African  child  by  fast-tracking
the processes of ensuring that the African child finds wisdom  in  enrolling
for hardcore science courses at tertiary level. You will also agree with  me
that the  underrepresentation  of  women  in  the  electricity  and  nuclear
sectors is shocking and cannot be accepted.
As the Department of Minerals and Energy we have decided to  take  the  bull
by the horns, together with the Minister. This year, on 9  August,  we  will
launch the very first South African chapter of Women in Nuclear, which  will
then affiliate to the Women in Nuclear internationally,  and  we  will  urge
kakhulukazi   nina   bomama   [especially   you    women]    to    encourage
amantombozanyana [young girls] by ensuring that  they  also  participate  in
this programme and thereby ensure that  we  are  able  to  have  more  women
demystifying the area of nuclear technologies.

I must say that in the past  financial  year  our  department,  through  the
International Atomic Energy Agency, was proud to produce Elsie  Monale,  the
first African woman in our department who has completed the 10-month  course
in IAEA safeguards training. [Applause.] As if  this  was  not  enough,  you
will be pleased to hear again that we have Ms Mphahlele,  who  is  with  the
National Nuclear Regulator as a  worker  and  who  has  won  the  Amy  Biehl
Fellowship. She is now in the process of completing her masters  in  nuclear
engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. [Applause.] With the  success
stories of our women, the impact on the South African chapter  of  Women  in
Nuclear, once launched in August, will be felt far and wide.  We  will  live
up to the adage that wathintha abafazi wathintha imbokodo  [you  strike  the
women, you strike the rock]!

I am thrilled to report  that  the  reorganisation  of  the  Nuclear  Energy
Corporation  of  South  Africa  has  been  approved.   This   reorganisation
separates Necsa's commercial activities from its  institutional  activities.
The redress of past imbalances in this institution  was  accelerated  during
this period. We are  proud  to  say  that  88%  of  the  171  staff  members
appointed  in  vacant  positions  at   Necsa   are   from   the   previously
disadvantaged groups.

For the first time in the history of this institution a woman was  appointed
to the executive management. [Applause.] We also need to indicate  that  the
profits from Necsa's sale of medical radioisotopes rose from R28 million  to
R40 million this year. Necsa intends  growing  the  isotope  business  to  a
turnover of R1 billion over a period of five years. Necsa recently signed  a
10-year contract worth R80 million per annum with  BOC  for  the  supply  of
nitrogen  trifluoride,  which  is  a  crucial  purging  agent  in   the   IT
manufacturing sector.

On  nuclear  safety,  the  National  Nuclear  Regulator,  through  effective
regulatory control, ensured that the dosage to workers is always  below  the
legal limit. The average dosage to workers was below 10% of  the  limit.  In
the mines, however, there were concerns about the high  doses  that  workers
receive mainly from radon, which occurs naturally underground. In  this  new
financial year we intend completing all regulations  required  in  terms  of
the  National  Nuclear  Regulator  Act.  Recognising  the  need  for  skills
development, the Department of Minerals  and  Energy,  in  partnership  with
DTI, initiated an agreement between the South  African  sector  role-players
and a French company called Areva. In terms of this  agreement,  Areva  will
provide high-level training to South Africans  in  the  nuclear  sector.  An
initial group of 25 South Africans will be trained  in  France  during  this
new financial year.

Rest assured, in September last year we concluded  the  Additional  Protocol
on Safeguards with the International Atomic Energy Agency. This protocol  is
aimed at ensuring that nuclear material is not diverted from  peaceful  uses
and applications. Through this  protocol  the  International  Atomic  Energy
Agency can provide credible assurance  of  the  absence  of  the  undeclared
nuclear material. We have already met our  first  obligations  in  terms  of
this protocol by submitting South Africa's expanded declaration on time.

In  view  of  international  concerns  raised  over  security  issues,   the
department allocated an additional R5 million  towards  the  improvement  of
security  measures  at  Necsa.  This  year  we  will  be  focusing  on   the
improvement of security at all our  nuclear  installations.  The  department
and the International Atomic Energy Agency will host  two  training  courses
on nuclear security. One of these courses will be for the countries  on  the
continent that have significant peaceful nuclear activities.

I will touch briefly on small-scale mining. A well-established  dogma  holds
that SMMEs are the ones that absorb and create jobs. In the area  of  small-
scale mining we are proud to have firmly ensured that  we  have  facilitated
and encouraged joint ventures between co-operatives and big business,  which
will assist greatly in transferring much-needed skills to our people in  the
disadvantaged communities. I refer to the transfer of skills  pertaining  to
ownership  such  as,  for  instance,  leadership,  finance,  legal  matters,
communication and others. They are being sorted  out  and  imparted  to  our
people.

Lastly, I would like to indicate that  we  as  a  department  are  proud  to
announce the launching of a new joint venture  on  30  June  of  this  year.
Through our participation over a period of three  years,  we  are  going  to
ensure that the community of Blaauwbosch, near Osizweni,  Newcastle,  enters
into  a  joint  venture  with  IDC,  Corobrik   and   ourselves.   Intuthuko
Blaauwbosch Trust is representing the community. This will create  jobs  for
121 people. We think the spin-offs for the  Blaauwbosch  community  and  our
broader community will be manifold, once more. Intuthuko  will  be  able  to
create a company which can take care of the community.

We have begun to work closely with them to cease  this  informal  operation.
We are looking at viable and sustainable alternative options that will  help
them to keep these informal miners. We need to say to ourselves, as  we  say
in Tsonga, inkomu va ka hina [thank my people]. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M  T  GONIWE:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Madam  Minister,  Madam  Deputy
Minister,  hon  members,  director-general,  staff  of  the  Department   of
Minerals and Energy, business leaders, comrades and friends, in response  to
the hon I O Davidson I want to say that there are none  so  blind  as  those
who will not see, and none so deaf as those who will not hear.  So  what  do
we do? Let the cowards flinch and let the traitors swear.

Today's debate takes place against the  backdrop  of  massive  and  decisive
advances made in addressing  the  key  challenge  facing  our  country.  The
challenge that is facing our country is not the SA Diamond Board; it  is  to
push back the frontiers of poverty.  We  are  of  the  firm  view  that  our
achievements should not be measured by what the SA Diamond Board  is  doing,
but they should be measured by the extent to  which  we  contribute  towards
pushing back the frontiers of poverty,  redressing  the  imbalances  of  the
past and thereby providing a better life for all.

In this context we boldly submit that when the history of  this  country  is
written, the pioneering role which the Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy
played in designing  and  effecting  broad-based  socioeconomic  empowerment
strategies will feature prominently.  This  could  not  have  been  possible
without the commitment and leadership of the Minister, the  Deputy  Minister
and the longest serving director-general in  this  democratic  dispensation,
as well as the strategic visionary leadership of our President Thabo Mbeki.
By excluding the majority of South Africans  from  meaningful  participation
in the economy, denying them skills, stripping  them  of  their  assets  and
undermining their  communities,  apartheid  concentrated  all  wealth  in  a
small, racially defined elite. This is the structure of the economy that  we
have inherited. Our historical challenge is to transform this economy.

It is not enough merely to remove the barriers  of  apartheid;  we  need  to
proactively  redress  the  wrongs  of  the  past.  We   need   comprehensive
strategies which will guarantee access to the economy for  those  previously
excluded at all levels, while  at  the  same  time  increasing  the  overall
competitiveness of our economy.

Black  economic  empowerment  should  provide  rapid  access  to  ownership,
management and control of economic activities for  previously  disadvantaged
South  Africans,  as  well  as  socioeconomic  development,  better  working
conditions and remuneration, development in rural  areas  and  opportunities
for small and  micro  enterprises  in  as  many  parts  of  the  economy  as
possible. The consequences of failing to achieve this will be severe for  us
all.

The  20th  century  saw  immense  development  of  our  mineral  and  energy
resources, yet the majority of  the  population  did  not  benefit.  On  the
contrary, more often than not they paid  for  this  development  with  their
blood and their sweat and not infrequently their lives.

The challenge of the post-apartheid era is to  transform  these  sectors  to
secure a sustainable future for all. This is the core  of  the  Government's
mineral and energy policy. More specifically,  the  concept  of  broad-based
socioeconomic empowerment, pioneered in the  minerals  and  energy  sectors,
provides  for  a  comprehensive  transformation  of  our  economy  from  the
boardrooms of our mining giants to the remote rural areas.

We should recognise the pioneering role played by the Liquid Fuels  Charter,
the first blueprint for the transformation  of  a  sector  of  our  economy.
White Papers outlining Government's vision for  the  transformation  of  the
minerals and energy complex were tabled in 1998. In the past year,  however,
we have really begun to see the fruits  of  this  transformation.  Some  key
milestones deserve mention, such as the passing last year by this  House  of
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources  Development  Act.  This  Act  laid  the
foundation for the transformation of the mining  sector.  Following  swiftly
on its heels was the Mining Charter, a key component of the  new  framework,
and we must congratulate the Minister and her department on the  speed  with
which this process was concluded. The department has recently  released  the
scorecard for empowerment in the mining industry and the royalties Bill  has
just been released and is provoking significant public debate.

Black economic empowerment in the liquid fuels industry has speeded  up.  In
addition to existing empowerment deals already  concluded  by  Shell,  Engen
and BP we  recently  heard  the  announcement  of  a  major  black  economic
empowerment deal by Caltex, as well as the  finalisation  of  Total's  black
economic  empowerment  deal.  We  are  awaiting  with  eager  interest   the
announcement of the black economic empowerment plans of the only  major  oil
company without a  significant  black  economic  empowerment  stake,  namely
Sasol. Thereafter we would urge that our focus be  trained  on  transforming
the gas and electricity sectors.

Last year also saw the launch of one of the giants, PetroSA.  After  a  long
process of restructuring the  state's  oil  assets,  PetroSA  has  become  a
significant success story, paying a significant dividend to  the  state.  In
addition,  PetroSA  also  leads  the  way  in  the  oil  industry   in   the
transformation of its management, as well as procuring services  from  black
economic empowerment companies.

The Government has introduced a new pricing formula for  petroleum  products
to replace the outdated IBLC. This will save consumers millions of rands  on
petrol and diesel bills.

We should also  recognise  the  nationally  important  role  played  by  the
associated institutions of the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy  and  in
particular  the  very  successful  efforts  at   transformation   in   these
institutions. To date we have witnessed far-reaching changes. Fresh  air  is
blowing in the boardrooms of the NER,  the  Council  for  Geoscience,  Serf,
Eskom, PetroSA, etc.

The leadership role that Eskom continues  to  play  in  the  electrification
programme is also worth mentioning as one of the key success stories of  the
RDP.

We must congratulate the Minister on  her  recent  receipt  of  the  highest
accolade from the National Union  of  Mineworkers,  in  recognition  of  her
championing of the cause of ordinary people in our  country,  in  this  case
mineworkers, who bear the brunt of injury,  death  and  ill  health  in  the
mining industry. This is a  statement  to  the  broad-based  nature  of  the
empowerment that the Minister is promoting.

As we implement more and more post-apartheid legislation, the role  of  both
the department and its associated regulators  increases  in  importance  and
complexity. Good governance  is  extremely  important,  both  in  the  state
sector and in the private sector. We are pleased  that  recent  problems  in
some of these institutions have been resolved openly and even-handedly.  The
conduct of our institutions and those who work  in  them  should  be  beyond
reproach and it is the responsibility of  each  and  every  citizen  in  our
country to report cases of corruption or maladministration.

Nevertheless there seems to be a growing trend in the  media  and  elsewhere
which seeks to portray  black  leadership  in  Government  institutions  and
business as being inherently corrupt and incompetent. Managers  and  leaders
should be evaluated on their merits alone, without reference to race.

Finally, in congratulating the Minister, her department and  the  associated
institutions on another year of outstanding achievement, we  note  that  the
department  still  has  significant  capacity  constraints.  The   more   we
transform the governance of  the  minerals  and  energy  sectors,  the  more
responsibilities we create for the department and  associated  institutions.
It is imperative that this should be recognised in the budget process if  we
are to realise the full potential of these sectors of our  society  and  our
economy.

Siyabonga kakhulu MaMlambo. [Thank you very much, MaMlambo.] [Applause.]

Mr E J LUCAS: Mr Chairman, in previous contributions to  the  annual  debate
on the Minerals and Energy Vote I have  stated  that  the  hon  Minister  of
Minerals and  Energy  is  responsible  for  two  of  the  biggest  and  most
important sectors of our national economy.  I  want  to  restate  that  fact
today as nothing has really changed.

The mining and minerals sector is still one of the biggest  contributors  to
our gross domestic product, foreign exchange  earnings,  Government  revenue
and employment levels. So, too, is the energy  sector,  that  in  many  ways
drives economic activities through a stable and relatively cheap  supply  of
electricity and other energy sources, such as fuel and natural gas. Yet,  as
with all economic portfolios in Government, the minerals and energy  sectors
are prone to a certain degree of volatility and  cyclical  movements  beyond
the direct control of the responsible Minister.

Recently, the strengthening of the rand against the US  dollar  has  led  to
warnings of job losses in  the  mining  industry.  It  has  also,  and  very
ironically, led to lower fuel prices. Who would be Minister of Minerals  and
Energy in conditions of such contradiction?

The  past  year  has  been  a  tumultuous  one  for  the  Minister  and  the
department. After many years of endeavour and negotiations, the Mineral  and
Petroleum Resources Development Act was finally passed  by  Parliament.  The
Act is one of the most far-reaching pieces  of  legislation  passed  by  the
democratic Government since 1994, as  it  fundamentally  alters  the  mining
landscape and the way that the private mining companies  interact  with  the
state in exploiting the nation's mineral resources to  the  benefit  of  all
its people for the first time in our history.

It also creates the opportunity for real transformation and  black  economic
empowerment in a historically minority-dominated  industry.  As  was  to  be
expected, not every party got exactly what they wanted  in  negotiations  on
the final Act. That is the nature  of  compromise.  But  the  IFP  wants  to
congratulate the Minister and all the other stakeholders for the mature  and
considered manner in which negotiations were conducted. Clearly all  parties
realised that national interest was more important than self-interest.

The Act also gave life to one of the  most  important  transformation  deals
since 1994, with the so-called mining empowerment charter seeing the  light.
The power of this negotiated  agreement  between  Government,  business  and
labour to drastically transform ownership patterns in  the  mining  industry
and other aspects, should not be  underestimated.  It  has  the  ability  to
fulfil one of the  most  vital  tasks  of  democratic  government,  that  of
broadening ownership and of participation in the economy  for  the  majority
who have previously been excluded.

 Herein, among others, lies the survival of democracy in South Africa.  Even
more so, the charter - after some initial  hiccups  -  provides  the  mining
community with the certainty and clarity it requires  to  do  what  it  does
best, that is creating wealth through long-term investments.  That  pertains
not only to the local mining community, but also to overseas  companies  and
investors that can compete on a level playing field in South Africa.

Having sung the praises of the Act and the charter, it would  only  be  fair
to express some disappointment at the length of time it  took  the  National
Treasury to come up with the Mineral and  Petroleum  Royalty  Bill,  without
which the main Act cannot be effectively  implemented.  The  Bill  has  been
made available for  public  comment,  and  just  recently  the  Minister  of
Finance, after discussing the Bill with  the  Chamber  of  Mines,  announced
that he would allow a  further  unspecified  period  to  consider  technical
issues. That is all fine and well, but the Bill is urgently needed  so  that
a new mining dispensation can finally be implemented in South Africa.

The IFP will support the 2003-04 budget of the Department  of  Minerals  and
Energy. Without going into much detail,  we  support  the  increase  of  R25
million on personal expenditure in  the  Vote,  as  it  is  clear  that  the
department will require additional capacity to  implement  the  Mineral  and
Petroleum  Resources  Development  Act,  and  to  manage   the   empowerment
scorecard emanating from  the  empowerment  charter.  We  also  support  the
increase of R137 million for the electrification  programme  as  Government,
in conjunction with Eskom and municipalities, strives to meet the  household
connection targets.

I also want to raise one final point of detail on the  department's  budget.
It is common knowledge that the apartheid  government  relentlessly  pursued
nuclear power, indeed nuclear weapons,  in  the  heyday  of  apartheid.  The
merits of that policy have long since been discredited  and  the  programmes
dismantled. Yet, democratic South Africa continues to pay for the  folly  in
the form of repayment of big loans. Last year the charge to  the  department
amounted to some R265 million. The good news is that this year  it  will  be
only R1,4 million, and next year the final  payment  will  amount  to  R10,7
million. The citizens of South  Africa  can  therefore  look  forward  to  a
department that one year from now would have diligently serviced  apartheid-
era debt which it had no hand whatsoever in incurring.

I also want to touch  on  some  general  policy  issues  pertaining  to  the
Department of Minerals and Energy. The first issue is the radioactive  waste
management policy. Whether we like it or not,  South  Africa  is  a  nuclear
power by virtue of the Koeberg nuclear station in the Western Cape, and  the
medium-level waste it produces. Currently, the nuclear waste  is  stored  on
site at Koeberg, but there will come a time when it has to  be  moved  to  a
long-term storage facility. South Africa is ill-prepared for  this  process,
and one of  the  reasons  is  that  we  do  not  have  a  new  comprehensive
radioactive waste management policy in place. It is  my  understanding  that
the Department and major stakeholders have  been  working  on  just  such  a
policy for more than four years. That is a long time for  consultation,  but
in light of Eskom's plan to build a prototype pebble bed modular reactor  at
Koeberg, we believe that the new comprehensive radioactive waste  management
policy is urgently needed so  that  the  long-term  solution  to  high-level
waste is decided upon and implemented before we run out of time.

Over  the  last  few  months  we  have  been  concerned  about  the   public
allegations of inappropriate and potentially fraudulent  activities  at  the
Strategic Fuel Fund and the SA Diamond Board.  The  IFP  believes  that  the
Minister acted correctly and quickly in ordering  investigations  and  other
proactive steps into these potential problems. Yet, we also  recognise  that
if these ministerial initiatives do not  quickly  lead  to  resolving  these
matters,  public  confidence  in  the  relevant  institutions  will  not  be
restored. Both play an  important  role  in  economic  activity  and  it  is
therefore vital  that  the  bona  fides  be  re-established  as  quickly  as
possible.

A further issue is the introduction of the new basic fuel price  formula  in
place of the in-bond landed cost formula. The IFP supports the  new  formula
as it appears to be more relevant and more indicative of daily  developments
on international markets. All in all the new formula should lead to  a  more
accurate price at the pump for consumers. But we also know  that  any  price
formula is dependent on the input factors such as the exchange rate and  the
international oil price. Currently, both  of  these  factors  benefit  South
Africa's fuel consumers. But this could, of course, change  in  the  future.
It is debatable whether any pricing formula could really  sustain  low  fuel
prices at the pump. We would therefore argue that the jury is still  out  on
whether the new pricing formula will really benefit consumers to the  extent
that has been claimed. We simply have to  wait  and  see  and  evaluate  all
factors after a few months.

In conclusion, the IFP believes that  the  Minister  of  the  Department  of
Minerals  and  Energy  has  a  difficult  balancing  act  between  effective
regulation and oversight of the minerals and energy sectors,  and  promoting
economic growth in  these  two  sectors  that  are  vital  to  our  national
economy. Nevertheless we feel that much progress  has  been  made  over  the
past year to unlock our natural wealth to the benefit of all our  people  in
this regard. The Minister and  the  department  must  be  congratulated  and
encouraged to continue their good work. I thank you.

Ms N S MTSWENI: Chairperson,  the  ANC  supports  the  Minerals  and  Energy
Budget  Vote  because  the  department  has  mostly  achieved  its  aims  of
addressing historical imbalances  in  South  Africa  through  the  equitable
distribution of energy and mineral resources. All of this  happened  because
of the good leadership provided by the director-general, Sandile  kaNogxina.
Director-General, we thank you and your dedicated staff  for  the  continued
hard work. [Applause.]  In  the  ANC's  1999  manifesto  our  focus  was  on
improving the quality of life. In the 2000  local  government  elections  we
focused on speeding up change, fighting poverty and creating a  better  life
for all. This year we are pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

The ANC welcomes the fact that the progress made has transformed the  energy
sector, while currently non-grid electricity is  approximately  10%  of  the
electricity allocation.  Non-grid  electricity  does  not  meet  the  energy
requirements of the household, the  limitation  being  technology.  As  more
technological advances are made, the renewable energy sector is expected  to
form a large part of the energy mix. The  introduction  of  the  free  basic
service has vastly improved the lives of the poor households  and  this  has
reduced the burden of  household  labour,  especially  gathering  water  and
wood, which usually falls on women and children.

Sihlalo la i-ANC yangithumela khona - endaweni engiyijamele la epalamende  -

[Chairperson, where the ANC has deployed me, a place which I represent  here
in Parliament, there is a woman who came  to  thank  the  ANC.  Where  I  am
deployed they speak Setswana. This woman came and said: ``Sister  Nomsa  ...
'' That is how I am addressed by elderly women.]

... ngwanaka, ke leboga ANC ka go busa seriti sa me. Mme a re o ne a  tlhoka

ANC ka go busa seriti sa gagwe.

Se ke sesupo sa gore  rona  re  le  ANC  re  teng.  (Translation  of  Tswana
paragraphs follows.)
[... my child, I thank the ANC for returning  my  dignity.  My  mother  says
that she did not have the money and could not phone  her  children  to  tell
them about her needs. She needed water and wood to make fire.  She  woke  up
early in the morning at 4 o'clock to draw water and fetch  wood.  My  mother
says that today, because of the ANC Government, she no longer  fetches  wood
and she has electricity in her house. She has tap water in her yard and  she
can phone her children because she also has a telephone. She thanks the  ANC
for returning her dignity.

This is evidence that we, the ANC, are there.]

The ANC further appreciates the flagship programme  on  integrated  national
electrification. We understand  that  this  programme  will  facilitate  the
continued expansion of access to electricity, that it has already  delivered
above its targets during 2001-02, and also that it will proceed to the  more
remote and sparsely populated rural areas where the larger  backlog  exists.
An integrated framework for a national strategy  to  roll  out  hybrid  mini
grids will be developed and implemented. This mini  grid  will  be  used  to
develop capacity and a vehicle to create awareness of such  systems  and  to
ensure sustainability, while emphasis  would  be  placed  in  particular  on
sociological facilities and capacity with communities, as  well  as  linking
these pilot mini grid systems to new economic activities.

Mr Minister, although we appreciate the good programmes mentioned above  and
the report on household connections as at  February  2002,  that  Eskom  has
exceeded the connections target, we have a problem with tariffs.  Eskom  has
to bear in mind the poorest of poor South Africans. It does  not  mean  that
these people do not want to pay; the problem  is  affordability.  Those  are
our people. They voted all of us into Parliament and they voted us  to  come
here and pass laws that will change their lives, not  laws  that  will  make
them suffer more than during the apartheid period. So Minister,  this  is  a
challenge to you.

Chairperson, the above issue brings in the problem around  public  education
on safety and efficiency. I am sure that the department  can  come  up  with
programmes if they are not there and projects that can  be  led  by  women's
organisations. Organisations like Sawima and Woesa  can  be  used  to  teach
people about public education  and  safety.  These  organisations  need  our
support. Minister, this is another challenge that  the  ANC  is  putting  on
your shoulders. You will remember what Comrade O  R  Tambo  said  about  the
emancipation of women in our struggle. So keep that in  mind  and  implement
what the ANC wants to implement.

The ANC welcomes the introduction of the White  Paper  on  Renewable  Energy
and the fact that it highlights the use  of  renewables  for  maintaining  a
balance between the  use  of  natural  energy  resources  and  environmental
considerations. When one talks about transformation, it goes a long way.  We
think of our women in particular - especially those in  rural  areas,  semi-
urban areas and squatter camps - and of how they were affected  by  the  use
of paraffin, gas, coal and biomass.  Paraffin  especially  is  cheaper,  but
much more dangerous. It can cause lots of damage to our people who  live  in
squatter camps. We have seen on television how, if one shack is  burned,  it
affects 10 to 15 of them. Most of us have seen  that.  So  renewable  energy
resources other than biomass have not yet been exploited to  the  full.  The
country's solar equipment industry is developing. The ANC  appreciates  this
initiative and other initiatives like the  solar  passive  building  design,
the national solar water heating programme, wind and hydro.

All the above initiatives will contribute to pushing back the  frontiers  of
poverty and giving our people a better  life.  They  will  not  continue  to
experience pollution, especially in winter, which has a  serious  impact  on
health. The ANC further  welcomes  the  national  programme  that  has  been
established with the objectives of introducing low-smoke  alternatives  into
townships.  Minister,  Deputy   Minister,   Chairperson   Goniwe   and   the
department, we thank you for your dedication and leadership.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chair, thank you very much. Since I  am  very  new  in  this
portfolio, but since the faculties between my peers are not  so  new  I  can
really take care ... [Interjections.] You should be  quiet,  because  I  was
going to say that I note the reason why hon Davidson fled, because he is  in
no moral position to say what he has said. He has no moral standing. He  was
a chairman of the Johannesburg City Council when our  people  were  arrested
for owing the council. He was also  the  chairman  instructing  the  council
people to attack our people. They had their  eyes  shot  out  that  day.  He
should be very,  very  quiet  and  get  off  his  high  horse  of  morality.
[Applause.]

Today will indeed be a maiden speech in so far as the  Minerals  and  Energy
Budget debate is concerned. Therefore one should,  instead  of  engaging  in
the analytical and academic, rather focus on the people  who  were  involved
in mining and what they went through in terms of the  sacrifices,  the  toil
and the suffering in order to  build  these  giants  we  have  today.  I  am
referring here to the asbestos mining ghost  in  Limpopo  and  the  Northern
Cape. I shall also touch on the plight of the  dispossessed  communities  in
the Richtersveld, etc.
I must get back to Eskom - I really can speak on Eskom - because  morally  I
have the platform to speak on  what  is  happening  to  our  communities  at
Eskom, and not the guy that I mentioned earlier, the  hon  member  that  has
fled. I shall also touch on solar energy,  and  wind  energy  or  perhaps  I
should rather say cleaner resources or environmentally  friendly  resources.
[Interjections.] [Laughter.]

Bly stil, Meneer. Ek meneer en jy meneer, wie sal dan  die  wa  moet  smeer?
Bly stil, Meneer. [Gelag.] [Be quiet, Sir. I am proud and, thou  art  proud,
who shall bear the ashes out? Be quiet, Sir. [Laughter.]]

Mr Chair, it is indeed much appreciated that Eskom has  brought  electricity
to nearly three million households in the Republic of South Africa over  the
past 10 years. In addition to improving the quality of  lives  of  millions,
their electrification has also contributed to, or resulted in, the  creation
of small, medium and macro  enterprises  within  disadvantaged  communities.
However, much more attention is needed  to  address  backlogs  and  economic
empowerment in rural areas.

There is also concern for the real or imaginary alarm bells sounded  by  the
unions about  possible  retrenchment  of  over  10  000  persons  out  of  a
workforce of slightly over 30 000, which would  make  up  about  one  third.
This is worrying if it is really true. But on the other hand,  we  have  the
privatisation  of  30%  of  the  assets  or  10%  going  to  black  economic
empowerment groups, which is seen in a  positive  light.  One  hopes  to  be
optimistic that positive confluences of  good  intentions  shall  eventually
address worker concerns.

Daar is 'n groei van 46% in Eskom se winste wat in  monetêre  terme  vertaal
na biljoene, terwyl baie verbruikers van krag  skreeu  oor  die  bo-inflasie
verhoging. Swak kredietmaatreëls en -kontroles  en  armoede  het  nou  ``bad
debts'' en ``irrecoverable debts'' in miljarde die hoogte ingeskiet. En  ja,
die persepsie is daar dat  Eskom  besig  is  om  van  homself  'n  politieke
organisasie te maak. As 'n mens luister na die uitlatings van  meneer  Fanie
Zulu, dan sal jy vir jouself sê, maar ``this is  devisive;  this  is  rather
mundane; this is a little bit intellectually pedestrian.''  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[There is a 46% growth in Eskom's profit which in monetary terms  translates
into billions, while many electricity consumers are crying out  against  the
above-inflation increase. Weak credit measures and  controls,  and  poverty,
have now had bad debts and irrecoverable debts sky-rocketing into  billions.
And yes, there is the perception that Eskom is busy turning  itself  into  a
political organisation. When one listens to the remarks of  Mr  Fanie  Zulu,
then you will  tell  yourself,  but:  "this  is  devisive;  this  is  rather
mundane; this is a little bit intellectually pedestrian."]

He should be careful, because if he wants to campaign we could register  him
with the IEC in order to become a political party. What  he  is  saying  has
political implications, but on the other hand  it  is  very  important  that
these perceptions should be laid to rest so that people can know. And  maybe
this should be reciprocated to other municipalities,  so  that  they  should
also now look at getting into this writing off, because  poor  is  not  only
poor in Soweto; poor is poor all over. We shouldn't allow the  hon  Davidson
to have said what he did, because he should not even have done that.

This is very serious and some people are promising to embark  on  campaigns,
which we should really try and avoid. I'm sure the Government is pro  people
- pro poor people - and that the matter can be laid to rest. One should  not
be a fire brigade all the time.

Over to the Richtersveld question.  Here  again  we  are  dealing  with  the
restoration of rights  of  the  Nama  community,  not  the  distribution  of
favours. These people's land was annexed by the  British  in  1847  and  the
subsequent discovery of diamonds in the area led to further -  according  to
senior  counsel  Trengrove  -  racist  dispossession,  whether   lawful   or
unlawful. The Nama community, the Government, Alexkor and Trensek need  wise
counsel to prevail here and to create a synergy between all role-players  so
that nobody may become a casualty  -  neither  the  mining  houses  nor  the
Government's reputation of  delivery,  nor  the  community  themselves.  The
Appeal Court in Bloemfontein has ruled, however, in the community's  favour,
but we know that there is an appeal that is coming that way.

In asbestos mining there is another landmark agreement  between  victims  of
asbestos-related diseases and British company PLCU. [Time expired.]

Mr S K LOUW: Thank you very much, Chairperson. I am speaking in  support  of
this Vote. The Minerals and Energy budget is  within  the  context  of  much
delivery  in  the  sector,  which  needs  to  be  reviewed  to   gauge   the
effectiveness of Government delivery over  the  coming  years  to  create  a
better life for all.

This delivery creates the first visible signs of concrete transformation  of
the liquid fuel industry towards the vision which is crystal  clear  in  the
White Paper on energy. It is  important  for  us  in  this  Budget  Vote  to
recognise the achievement of the Ministry and the department before  setting
out our priorities of further delivery.

IBLC has changed to basic fuel price. The country, through  the  efforts  of
SFF, possessed strategic stock at a crucial time, as thereafter  the  Middle
East was plunged into crisis with the war in Iraq  and  uncertainty  in  the
international crude oil prices. The matter between  SFF  and  HBTI/Trafigura
has been resolved to the satisfaction of Government. State assets have  been
effectively restructured in the liquid  fuel  sector  into  a  national  oil
company, which is South Africa's own PetroSA.

In the liquid fuel sector the former apartheid government created a  variety
of state assets in efforts to avoid international  sanctions.  These  assets
were not created on a sound commercial base  and  this  did  not  cover  the
entire value chain. To operate  productively  in  a  commercial  base  these
assets  never  possessed  the  requisite  skills  base,  resulting  in  some
companies suffering financial loss.

Our Government has been acutely aware of the problems these state assets  in
the liquid fuel sector face in the post-apartheid era and it  has  therefore
engaged in a process to restructure. The launch  of  PetroSA  was  indeed  a
proud moment  in  the  history  of  the  liquid  fuel  industry,  given  its
notorious  past  under  the  apartheid  regime.  PetroSA  has  an  important
economic role to play as a commercial enterprise. Government would  like  to
view  the  company  as  a  measuring  gauge  to  judge  the  oil  industry's
performance and contribution to the economy of South Africa.

PetroSA is a world leader in its experience of converting  gas  to  liquids,
which requires global marketing as no other GTL plant has the  manufacturing
capacity of PetroSA and the function of such a lengthy period. Gas,  as  all
of us know by now, is one of the most critical energy resources and it is  a
strategic partner in the  energy  industry.  It  is,  in  fact,  ensuring  a
paradigm shift in terms of renewables. With that objective it  also  has  to
provide low-cost energy for South  Africa  and  the  African  region,  which
makes it a potential partner for a commercial relationship  with  any  other
possible supplier  of  gas  within  the  region.  By  doing  this,  it  will
contribute to the efforts and processes  aimed  at  the  generation  of  the
continent, which has an abundance of untapped energy resources.

Countries within the African Union, such as the DRC, Angola, Mozambique  and
Nigeria, have the potential to develop their energy resources and to  ensure
sustainable growth within the integration of  state  assets  in  the  liquid
fuel sector into a national oil company. It is  absolutely  imperative  that
the Ministry and department  consider  the  restructuring  of  CEF  into  an
energy development arm to serve the economic priorities  of  our  new  South
Africa.

It is about time to consider that the new CEF has to  be  put  out  and  all
commercial activities contained in CEF should, as a matter of  priority,  be
transferred to PetroSA. The Ministry and the department should  also  define
the structures of the new CEF and its developmental role.

I want to focus on a thorny issue in the industry, which is  very  important
to this House, and that is the Sasol  subsidy.  It  must  be  put  out  very
clearly that the  national  oil  company,  PetroSA,  does  not  require  any
subsidy. This means that other fuel producers  like  Sasol  equally  do  not
require any  subsidy.  In  business  terms  they  used  to  call  it  tariff
protection. Tariff protection in this  context  means  that  no  subsidy  is
required in a context where production costs are  under  US$10  per  barrel.
Moreover, it is important to refresh the memory of  the  department  to  the
fact that the Arthur Andersen report initially suggested  that  the  subsidy
would be in the region  of  R1,5  billion.  For  a  number  of  years  these
subsidies  have  been  stopped  and  the  department   should   not   resume
subsidising  any  other  project  further,  as  it  is  never   economically
justifiable.

In fact, research funding  would  be  a  better  spend  in  other  areas  of
importance. We need to look into better options on how to spend on  research
funding on a tariff protection study. We also need to  be  more  focused  on
NGOs engaged in research in this sector  that  need  funding  and  are  busy
collapsing.

Energy is the driving force for our national economy. Our industry  and  its
stakeholders have a special role to play. It has  to  align  itself  to  the
priorities of  Government  to  ensure  a  better  life  for  all.  Many  oil
companies have made an important start towards implementing  black  economic
empowerment. The efforts of  our  Minister  towards  achieving  BEE  in  the
industry are commendable, as  mountains  of  work  were  initiated  in  this
project.

PetroSA is a leading figure in this process. It can  be  clearly  identified
as a champion in this terrain, whilst there are others who  are  undermining
the process, producing an uneven scale ... [Applause.]

Ms  N  V  CINDI:  Ndiyabulela,  Maqabane  [Thank  you,  comrades].  Minister
MaMlambo, Deputy  Minister  Susan,  hon  Director-General  Sandile  Nogxina,
members of Parliament, colleagues and friends, it's just a pity  that  I  am
talking long after Mr Davidson said the wrong things  to  us,  but  I  don't
think we should care about what he has just  said.  Maybe  he  is  suffering
from foot-in-mouth disease. [Laughter.]

Government is recognising the potential of small mining as a tool to  reduce
poverty and create employment, especially in the  rural  areas.  As  we  all
know, the majority of people in the rural areas are  poor  women  who  enter
the  mining  sector  for  purposes  of  providing  a  livelihood  for  their
families. Government has committed itself to seeing to it  that  the  small-
scale mining sector receives the necessary  attention  in  order  to  become
sustainable, in line with the minerals and mining policy of South Africa.

The Department of Minerals and Energy, or DME,  will  increase  the  funding
allocation annually to assist in developing the  small-scale  mining  sector
from R5,1 million to R15 million for the 2003-04 budget year.  We  therefore
show our commitment to the sector by putting our money where our mouth is.

We are completing the recruitment of nine small-scale mining  officers,  who
will enhance our capacity  to  deliver  services  to  this  sector  in  each
province. Said officers will  co-ordinate  all  functions  relating  to  the
execution of  the  DME's  goals  on  the  ground.  This  includes  providing
information, guiding aspirant  new  entrants  to  the  mining  industry  and
generally supporting them while also integrating the DME's efforts in  other
development initiatives in other areas of operation. In this  regard  it  is
important therefore that an effort be made to also support women  in  mining
through structures like Sawima.

Through the structures established by and working closely with  the  DME  we
continue  to  provide  assistance  with   resources,   evaluation,   project
development,  business  planning,  environmental  management  training   and
financial guidance.
The department is processing over 120 applications for  small-scale  mining,
as well as applications from  women  miners  from  all  nine  provinces.  In
addition there are approximately 20 projects which are at  different  stages
of development. With regard to other  applications,  the  national  steering
committee is in the process of identifying those  with  the  best  potential
for viability to be added on as projects.

Very often when one  discusses  small-scale  mining  and  Sawima's  specific
problems, those who are  involved  always  point  out  that  they  encounter
problems in relation to access to minerals right, access to land, access  to
finance, the lack of technical expertise  and  entrepreneurial  skills,  and
access to information such as  geological  and  mineral  economic  data  and
proper interpretation thereof.

Government is well aware of these problems and barriers, and we  are  taking
measures to  address  these  issues.  It  is  critical  that  we  focus  the
attention  of  the  DME's  efforts  on  driving   the   small-scale   mining
development process forward as well as on  the  participation  of  women  in
mining to ensure successful integration into the mainstream  mining  sector.
Success in obtaining funding, facilitating  joint  ventures  where  possible
and getting projects off the ground is reliant on the  total  dedication  of
all the stakeholders in a project.

Government has committed itself to see to it  that  the  small-scale  mining
sector receives the necessary attention  in  order  to  become  sustainable.
Together with our partners in the industry, we have initiated a  small-scale
development framework to provide institutional support  to  the  small-scale
miners, as there are already pilot projects which have been  identified  and
funded.

Most of  the  operators  lack  adequate  capital  and  ability  to  evaluate
potential reserves. This results in operations  that  are  very  unsafe  and
damaging to the  environment.  The  target  market  for  assistance  by  the
framework remains the illegal or substandard operations,  which  we  aim  to
legalise  and  convert   into   sustainable   operations;   undercapitalised
operations   which   require   expansion   or    optimisation;    first-time
entrepreneurs interested in entering the sector; and,  mostly,  open  graves
waiting  to  swallow  victims  due  to  unsafe   and   unhealthy   operating
conditions.

In 2003 the National Small-Scale Mining  Development  Framework  is  set  to
achieve  the  following  goals:  completion  of  the  Postmasburg  Iron  Ore
Business Plan and  project  capitalisation;  setting  up  of  the  pegmatite
processing facility in Namaqualand; the construction  of  a  second  diamond
plant destined for diamond prospecting in the  Northern  Cape;  contributing
to the generation of training and qualification standards through  the  MQA,
the mining industry Seta; implementation of the  sandstone  dimension  stone
industry in  the  Free  State;  and  the  copper-leaching  exercise  in  the
Northern Cape.

The small-scale mining sector can make a  significant  contribution  to  job
creation in the mining industry  and  thereby  alleviate  poverty  in  South
Africa. It is estimated that about 1 000 jobs can be created for every 7  to
10 sustainable small-scale mining projects implemented.

The National Small-Scale Mining Development Framework continues  to  provide
the following services to approved projects. We have  resources  evaluation;
project development and training; environment management planning;  business
planning; and financial guidance.

The South  African  mining  industry  is  male  dominated.  Women  who  were
employed there were doing jobs that have traditionally been seen as  women's
work, such as clerical, secretarial, catering and  other  work.  It  is  the
purpose of the mining charter to  redress  this  alienation  of  blacks  and
women in the mining industry. [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister and  Deputy  Minister,
the MF is proud of you two mbokodos [rocks]. [Applause.]

The effective  management  of  this  sector  is  extremely  crucial  to  our
economy, especially its  performance  on  the  JSE.  However,  concerns  are
spread beyond this to various factors concerning the sector.

In terms of energy, there are  factors  around  energy  efficiency  and  the
environment with regard to which precaution is a must.  In  so  doing,  much
planning  and  analysis  of  energy  data  is  necessary.  The  department's
accuracy in calculation is  crucial  and  the  action  taken  is  important.
Energy covers a wide spectrum, namely nuclear,  electricity,  liquid  fuels,
coals, gas and renewable energy, that all contribute to our economy as  well
as our social sustenance.

The MF is quite  pleased  and  impressed  by  the  department's  efforts  in
mineral development in this sector. The department  has  undertaken  efforts
in mining economics, mineral  economics,  mine  rehabilitation  and  mineral
regulations. We know that no task comes without hiccups, and the media  have
a strong hand in covering that.

One of our great concerns in this sector is the labour force.  To  date  the
statistics on mineworkers with HIV/Aids are shocking and horrific.  But  the
MF is aware that the department has policies  and  programmes  in  place  to
oversee the mine health programme and safety regarding issues such  as  mine
equipment, mine surveying, mine safety, the  Mine  Health  and  Safety  Act,
occupational health, examinations, award schemes and accident rates.

It's impressive to note that seven commodities with regard to South  African
reserves rank the highest  globally.  Noting  our  large  reserve  base  and
importance as a global producer,  we  are  really  export  orientated.  This
plays a major  role  in  our  economy.  The  MF  supports  the  Bill.  [Time

Mr N NGCOBO: Thank  you,  Chair.  Hon  Minister,  Deputy  Minister  and  hon
members of Parliament, I start by accepting the  Budget  Vote  for  Minerals
and Energy on behalf of the ANC. My theme today will be based  predominantly
on considering the nuclear  programme  and  the  policies  of  South  Africa
before and after apartheid.

Many people are not very well informed on the origins of nuclear  power  for
commercial purposes. Therefore, if you do not have a correct  base  you  are
likely to commit a number of errors. So it is  very  important  that  people
are given a good background so that some of the arguments  and  debates  can
be based on sound information, knowledge and sources.

Nuclear power in itself originated in the year  1932,  when  they  dicovered
the neutron at  the  Cavendish  Laboratory  at  Cambridge  University.  This
marked  the  beginning  of  nuclear  energy   generation   research,   which
culminated in 1942 in the  design  of  the  first  nuclear  reactor  at  the
University of Chicago, called the CP1.  Following  this  the  United  States
government started to classify  this  dicovery  into  what  was  called  the
Manhattan Project, which culminated  in  the  announcement  of  the  nuclear
capability of the United  States  and  the  destructive  power,  in  nuclear
terms, which destroyed the two cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

At the time this was viewed by the Soviet Union as a threat  to  the  world.
Therefore people in the Soviet Union were also quickly instructed by  Stalin
to engage in this classified  project,  which  culminated  in  1949  in  the
Soviet Union's announcement of its first nuclear atomic bomb.

In a nutshell, nuclear power for consumer purposes came as a  by-product  of
military use of nuclear technology in the  world.  Therefore,  South  Africa
was no exception. Literature reveals that in the apartheid era South  Africa
launched the nuclear weapons programme as  part  of  its  national  security
policy, based on the perception of a domestic,  regional  and  international
threat, encapsulated in the theory of  ``total  onslaught''  as  planned  by
communist  forces  globally,  regionally  and  domestically.  The  USSR  was
perceived as the main orchestrator of global communism that would lead to  a
conventional assault on South African territory.

In the view of Admiral Biermann, Commandant  General  of  the  SADF  in  the
early 70s, successful  defence  of  the  southern  hermisphere  lay  in  the
deterrent strategy based on nuclear  terror.  The  escalation  of  political
changes in the Southern African region, which  saw  the  end  of  Portuguese
rule in Angola and  Mozambique  in  1974  and  the  emergence  of  communist
regimes in these countries, reinforced the conviction that South Africa  was
being encircled by communist forces for the final takeover by these forces.

The intensification of the anti-apartheid  struggle  of  the  mid-seventies,
including the 1976 uprising, was, according  to  the  apartheid  government,
also sponsored by these communist forces and this  development  strengthened
the regime's resolve to develop a nuclear deterrent capability. The  arrival
of Cuban troops in  Angola  after  the  establishment  of  the  MPLA  regime
provided a final stimulus  for  the  apartheid  regime  to  develop  such  a
defence capability. In the words of PW Botha,  the  then  defence  minister,
South Africa had  to  strengthen  both  its  conventional  and  its  nuclear
capabilities.
South Africa also enjoyed support and  sympathy  from  Western  powers,  who
also perceived the changes in the Southern  African  region  as  the  USSR's
communist expansionism on the African continent, which  had  to  be  stopped
before their economic interests were at stake inside South Africa.

Earlier in 1948, the Atomic Energy Board, or AEB, as it was  known  at  that
time, had been established by an Act of Parliament. The latter  led  to  the
start of  nuclear  research  and  development  activities  in  1961  at  the
Pelindaba site near Pretoria. Although  the  research  activities  in  those
years seemed based on the peaceful use  of  nuclear  technology,  it  seemed
that the long-term consideration by the Western powers was to protect  their
economic interest against USSR expansionism.

Evidence from  the  50s  and  the  60s  shows  that  South  Africa  received
extensive assistance from abroad, ranging from the  training  of  scientists
in Europe and the US right up to providing  highly  enriched  uranium  under
the pretext that this was to be used  for  the  peaceful  nuclear  explosive
programme. In 1965 the United States thus supplied  South  Africa  with  the
Safari-1 research reactor which is at Pelindaba today, and in  10  years  it
also supplied South Africa with 100 kg of weapons-grade uranium.

Naturally, uranium occurs as 3 isotopes, namely uranium 234  isotope,  which
is about 0,0057%; uranium 235, which is  about  0,7193%;  and  uranium  238,
which is in abundance  as  99,275%.  When  enriched  for  weapons  purposes,
uranium 234 becomes 0,1%, uranium 235  becomes  94,0%  and  uranium  238  is
reduced to 5,88%. When it is to be used for reactors  like  Koeberg,  it  is
called low enriched uranium in which uranium 234 is 0,025%, uranium  235  is
3,5% and uranium 238 is 96,475%. So this is just a clarification of  what  I
will be talking about, namely the enrichment  activities  that  happened  in
some of the plants at Pelindaba and Valindaba.

In 1975 this support of South  Africa  by  the  USA  was  suspended  due  to
international  sanctions  against   apartheid   policies.   Following   this
suspension South Africa began to engage in secret  procurement  networks  in
Europe and the USA and also began secret collaboration with Israel,  leading
to a joint nuclear and missile programme between the 70s and the 80s.  South
Africa was also provided with methods for producing and separating  weapons-
grade plutonium and uranium during this period.  Following  this,  the  then
Prime Minister John Voster informed Parliament in  1970  about  the  uranium
enrichment project and the building of the  pilot  plant,  the  Y-plant,  at
Valindaba, next to the Pelindaba Research Centre.

This Y-plant was commissioned in 1974. In 1978 it began  to  produce  highly
enriched uranium for the weapons programme. In addition  to  this,  the  new
plant also produced 45% of enriched uranium  for  the  Safari-1  reactor  at
Pelindaba, thus defeating the effect of the sanctions regime as  imposed  by
the international community in this regard. The Y-plant produced a total  of
about 400 kg of weapons-grade uranium, which was  used  for  South  Africa's
nuclear weapons. But in 1978  the  US  Congress  enacted  the  nuclear  non-
proliferation Act, which precluded the transfer  of  nuclear  technology  to
countries not party to the non-proliferation treaty. This  Act  was  applied
retroactively on all previous agreements and contracts and directly  led  to
the refusal of export permits to South Africa for  shipments  to  France  of
its own uranium, already enriched by the US department  of  energy  for  the
Koeberg nuclear power plant.

This latter contract had been concluded between Eskom and the US  department
of energy soon after the conclusion of the reactor supply  contract  between
Framatome of France and Eskom in 1974. Despite this - its refusal  to  grant
Eskom an export permit for  the  transfer  of  enriched  uranium  -  the  US
department  of  energy  still  held  Eskom  fully  liable  for  payment  for
enrichment work completed under the contract. This  catch-22  situation  ...
[Time expired.] [Applause].

Ms N F MATHIBELA:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  hon  members,  ladies  and
gentlemen, I feel honoured to be part of this debate. Firstly, I would  like
to congratulate the Minister  on  her  award  of  iSithwalandwe,  which  she
received from the NUM, and also to congratulate the  NUM  on  the  wonderful
and successful conference which they have just had. [Applause.]

Ndithi:  Phambili,  mantombazana.  Yibambeni.  Wathint'  abafazi,   wathint'
imbokotho! [I say: Forward, ladies. Hold on to it. You strike a  woman,  you
strike a rock!]

You teach a woman, you teach a nation. That is  why  the  mining  sector  is
being transformed today. [Applause.]

Chairperson, allow me to get to the business  of  the  day,  the  budget  of
Minerals and Energy, which the ANC welcomes with open arms  and  which  will
help to improve the lives of our people who  were  previously  neglected  by
the minority government. We applaud our Government,  which  is  led  by  the
giant movement, the ANC. This Government has  aim  and  vision,  a  mission,
slogan and mandate, and values.

Our achievements are Arm Gold, Vaal Reefs and Orkney. Up to 102 miners  died
in 1995 and the Government built houses for their  families  and  gave  them
projects and skills training. Compare this to the Coal Brook Mine  accident,
where 500 miners were  killed  and  their  families  got  nothing  from  the
previous government. In the same disaster,  a  mother  lost  five  sons  and
nothing was done for her.  This  shows  that  our  Government  is  a  caring
government.

The Minister has put money aside which  is  committed  to  mine  safety  and
health. The amount  is  R80,067  million,  with  an  adjustment  of  R86,361
million. That is a sign of a caring  government.  Previously,  these  people
were not even considered as human beings. If there was a disaster,  most  of
them were not even known and their families would  not  even  be  contacted.
There were no safety measures. However, our Government is making  sure  that
it improves safety daily in the mining sector.

At the time of the report, it was pointed out that  14  million  people  are
living with HIV/Aids in Africa, and other reports indicate that HIV/Aids  is
a serious concern in Africa as a  whole.  HIV/Aids  is  one  area  that  the
Minister is concerned about, as we all know that  these  men  are  far  from
their families and also  get  infected  with  this  pandemic.  According  to
volume 10 of the fourth issue of the SA HIV/Aids  Information  Dissemination
Service, dated December 2002, at the time of the report it was  pointed  out
that 14 million people were affected and  infected.  This  report  indicates
that it is really a serious concern. For example, what contributes  to  this
is illiteracy, disability, the unwillingness of  mine  managers  to  educate
miners, and let's not forget poverty and housing.

Finally, we make a plea to all communities to help fight these diseases  and
commit ourselves to Government's plans. [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Chair, Minister and fellow members, it is my pleasure to  speak
on behalf of the DA in this budget debate.

When discussing a budget, one is inclined to think only of the money  needed
and allocated to a project or a department. In fact, the planning  behind  a
budget is far more important, and it is this aspect that I will discuss.
I'm pleased to hear  of  the  completion  of  the  Integrated  Energy  Plan,
although we have not seen it yet,  but  hopefully  we  will,  very  shortly.
Eskom, as we all know, is our major supplier of  energy,  using  coal  as  a
provider of heat energy, which is converted to electrical energy.

Some 30 years ago, the forecast for  energy  consumption  was  overestimated
and power stations were built to meet the perceived needs. This resulted  in
South Africa having far more electricity available than  required.  Smaller,
older stations  were  mothballed  and  the  building  of  two  stations  was
actually cancelled.

Today we are caught up and we hear that our peak loads  are  almost  at  the
limit of our capacity. In fact, from press  reports  and  industry  reports,
there was a sudden surge in power demand, and in March an 8,5% increase  was
experienced. This is far higher than anticipated, and  winter  is  not  here
yet.

The possibility seems imminent that shortages may be experienced if  nothing
is done immediately. The question is whether the  mothballed  stations  will
be refurbished and commissioned  in  time.  Has  the  source  of  coal  been
indentified and have contracts been signed? Is Transnet  capable  of  moving
the coal supplies efficiently? Have they the engines? Have they the  rolling
stock?  Have  they  sufficient  qualified  drivers  to  meet  the  increased
traffic?

 All these questions must be answered if Eskom is to produce  enough  energy
this winter and in future. It is very encouraging to hear that the  Southern
African Power Pool is progressing well and  may,  if  the  politics  can  be
resolved, supply sufficient energy for South Africa in the future.

The stronger rand alone in some aspects is excellent for the country. It  is
a disaster when we talk of exports and the mining industry. Gold,  platinum,
coal, iron, ore and many other minerals are all looking carefully  at  their
profits. Some gold companies  have  already  announced  the  possibility  of
cutting back and deferring capital projects.  Our  three  main  coal  mining
companies have said that they are all reviewing their activities.  The  rand
needs to be more stable and should not fluctuate to the extent  that  it  is
doing for our industry to plan ahead.

With our enhanced activities, research is becoming more and more  important.
This Government needs to review the resources allocated to this field if  we
are to remain a major force on the African continent.

The money Bill, to complete the implementation of the Mining Rights Act,  is
still not in place and we await this Bill with trepidation. From reports  we
have learned that it could be very controversial.

The Council for Geoscience is doing excellent work in the field  of  mapping
our country and the African shelf. They need to be encouraged  and  properly
financed.

Prof I J MOHAMED: Deputy Chairperson, it is a pleasure for  me  to  support,
on behalf of the ANC, the Budget Vote of  the  Department  of  Minerals  and
Energy, the DME. We congratulate the  hon  Minister  Phumzile  Mlambo-Ngcuka
and her Deputy Minister, Susan Shabangu, and her staff for a  department  we
have the greatest pleasure to work  with,  and  particularly  the  director-
general, Adv Sandile Nogxina. We know our Minister will accept the  bouquets
with pleasure and the brickbats with grace.

Deputy Chair, my focus will be on the  electricity  programme  of  the  DME.
Electricity has a major impact on our lives, from the poorest dweller  in  a
mkhukhu [informal settlement] concerned about free basic electricity to  the
mining  executive   requiring   high-tension   power   lines   and   special
transformers. There are issues of efficiency, costs and  what  you  can  get
for your 50kWh or your 100 000kWh. The developing economy  and  our  ability
to compete in the global market are crucial for the wellbeing of  all  South
Africans  and  depend  on  the  availability  of  efficient  and  economical
electricity. The DME's  current  main  concern  is  with  energy  efficiency
improvements, transformation of the industry and meeting  social  needs  and
expectations.

Let us consider energy efficiency improvements. The  supply  of  electricity
in the city and major towns is reasonably  efficient.  There  are,  however,
problems of meter readings, supply cutouts  at  times  and  even  substation
blowouts because of overloading. There are serious  concerns  about  cutouts
due to low voltage in the rural areas.

The DME says that the key problem in rural  areas  has  been  identified  as
that  of  infrastructure.  Municipalities  are   reluctant   to   make   any
investments  in  infrastructure  until  the  planned  regional   electricity
distributors, or REDs, are formed. This is one of the reasons  why  the  DME
is speeding up restructuring. Eskom  has  set  aside  R700  million  in  the
current financial year to revamp their electricity infrastructure, which  we
welcome.

We have to deal with the legacy of  apartheid,  which  created  problems  of
crime and a situtation in which the poor and most blacks were  not  provided
with many essential services like electricity and homes.  Today  we  have  a
small criminal element that  vents  their  frustration  about  the  cost  of
electricity through vandalising  prepaid  meters.  The  ANC  is  helping  to
explain the advantage of prepaid meters,  especially  in  Soweto  and  other
major areas. We welcome this, but need to do more to  address  the  problems
of the poor.

In part of my constituency area, namely Doornkop  in  Soweto,  part  of  the
Johannesburg metropolitan area, the only clinic was  at  one  stage  without
electricity for a few weeks. The  result  was  that  they  could  not  store
antibiotics or vaccines. Our constituency office  intervened  on  behalf  of
the clinic. This problem results  from  the  stealing  of  cables,  and  the
community needs to address this wherever it occurs.

I  want  to  turn  to  transformation  and  restructuring.   Currently   the
electricity industry consists of the vertically  integrated  monopoly  Eskom
alongside a number of municipal distributors.  The  generation,  supply  and
distribution are largely in this one monopoly, Eskom.

This structure is unsustainable. Distribution is largely  in  structures  of
inefficient size, tariffs  vary  widely  across  the  country  and  so  does
efficiency. Generation has few incentives to  compete  on  price.  There  is
little competition from gas and oil as these are at this stage rather  small
providers. The DME budget allocation to electricity is 145 times as much  as
that for hydrocarbons.

The DME has developed policies for the reconstruction  of  distribution  and
supply. This year the electricity distribution holding  company  will  begin
the reform of the distribution industry, for which  extra  funds  have  been
provided. The  department  says  significant  progress  on  the  electricity
supply industry will be made this year.

What is the position about generation? The DME is currently  engaged  in  an
approach  as  follows.  Firstly,  the  corporatisation  of  Eskom  has  been
achieved. Secondly, we have the reclustering of  the  generation  plants  of
Eskom to stimulate internal competition to  ensure  more  efficiency  gains.
Thirdly, the market rules on how trading will take place in the  electricity
market will be completed and presented to Cabinet  before  the  end  of  the
year. A trial run on how the market will operate using Eskom  clusters  will
be undertaken. Fourthly, the private sector  will  be  introduced  once  the
efficacy of the market rules has been established. One of  the  reasons  for
market failures all over the world is poor market rules.  The  ANC  welcomes
these intiatives.

We  welcome  the  approval  of  the  DME's  policies   on   black   economic
empowerment, or BEE. A state-owned transmission company will be  formed  and
10% of generation capacity will be sold to BEE groups. The DME  says  it  is
Government's view that for effective empowerment  there  should  be  broader
involvement of various participants. The department  has  done  a  study  to
establish the interest in the BEE sale by  approaching  existing  companies,
and found that interested BEE companies in the 10% sell-off  already  exist.
Part  of  the  transformation  process  is  the  development  of   renewable
energies, which my comrade Nomsa Mtsweni addressed already.

The DME also says that it will ensure the provision of  low-smoke  coal  and
the energy efficiency of this. The  department  will  collaborate  with  the
Department  of  Health  to  monitor  health  cases  as  a  key   performance
indicator.

The social imperatives are a very crucial issue to address.  The  Integrated
National Electrification  Programme  aims  to  provide  universal  household
access to basic services within 10 years and electrification of all  schools
and clinics. The current backlog in electrification for households  is  33%,
while the estimated number of schools and  clinics  without  electrification
is 10 000 and 500 respectively.

According to Stats SA, based on their 1996  census,  the  population  growth
rate is 2,2% per annum. The 10-year horizon was based on  zero  growth  rate
and at current funding levels it will be closer to 12 years.
Free basic electricity of 50kWh is a key component of Government  policy  to
alleviate poverty and meet  social  expectations,  which  we  wholeheartedly
support. Fifty  kilowatt-hours  offers  very  basic  electricity  needs.  It
offers limited cooking, ironing,  lighting,  water  heating  and  access  to
radio and  television.  It  does  not  meet  social  expectations,  even  at
present, but it's a major step in poverty alleviation.

Finally, there is the thorny issue of price increases for  electricity.  New
power stations will have to be built, possibly three. Eskom says there  will
have to be substantial increases, as the cost of  these  would  have  to  be
recovered. The National Electricity  Regulator  says  that  they  will  keep
price increases below the inflation rate. The DME says  there  is  no  other
way of funding the new capital costs except by  passing  the  costs  to  the
consumer.

So it seems clear that we can brace ourselves for a substantial increase  in
electricity costs and repercussions through  the  industry  chain.  We  will
recall that the ANC  Government  had  to  intervene  to  pay  arrears  which
resulted from the disastrous policies of the previous government.

We are confident that the DME will find an acceptable solution,  as  we  are
all concerned about remaining within the inflation targets of Government.

I would like, for  the  last  few  minutes  available,  to  talk  about  the
Expenditure Estimates. Very briefly, if we  look  at  Expenditure  Estimates
and trends, the allocation to the Energy Management Programme for this  year
is R1,2 billion, or 67% of the DME's total allocation of R1,8  billion.  The
allocation to this programme increases to R1,3 billion by  the  end  of  the
MTEF period and remains constant at 64% of the Vote.

Transfer payments are of some concern. These are R27 million last year,  R71
million this year and escalate to  R83  million  by  the  end  of  the  MTEF
period. The DME must give us  more  details  of  this.  The  expenditure  on
professional services increases from R15 million last year  to  R22  million
by the end of the MTEF period. These figures suggest the  DME  has  received
the additional funding to address the known  staff  shortages,  but  on  the
other hand we need  to  know  why  the  professional  services  and  special
services are required. The DME has provided  us  with  an  answer  to  that,
which I cannot go into right now. Thank you, Chair.

Mr J H NASH: Chairperson, this Budget Vote  occurs  within  the  context  of
real change, delivery and transformation in the minerals and energy  sector.
Budget Votes are  not  about  praise  singing  but  about  stocktaking.  The
Minister, the Deputy Minister, the director-general and his staff  all  need
to be congratulated on the level of delivery over the past year.

It is imperative that  Government  does  not  fall  into  the  trap  of  the
opposition DA  that  merely  criticises  without  any  concrete  alternative
policy on any matter of importance in the minerals and energy sector.  After
10 Budget Votes it is clear that the DA has no real policy on the  heart  of
the South African economy, namely minerals and energy. Their commitment  and
contribution to the development of  the  people  and  the  economy  of  this
country is faulty, callous and therefore suspect.

The only thing which Mr Davidson could come with today was  the  SA  Diamond
Board, and for his benefit the CEO of this board was suspended. He  asks  us
to tell him about the accountability of the Minister. The diamond  evaluator
was replaced and an inquiry was instituted. What more do you want  from  the
Minister, Mr Davidson? Tell me. Mr Bell wants to know, of all things,  where
Eskom is going to get the trucks to supply coal  during  the  winter.  Where
did we get them all these years, Mr Bell? Tell me.  One  sees  how  bankrupt
the DA is.

The  launch  of  PetroSA  has  been  a  mammoth  achievement   through   the
restructuring of disparate state assets into a national oil company. In  the
development of a policy for the liquid fuels sector  the  opposition,  which
opposes all  constructive  ideas  for  the  country's  development,  had  to
suggest that the national oil company was never a real possibility. This  is
really the never-never party on our left here.  Today  this  possibility  is
fully functional and exploring for  opportunities  outside  the  borders  of
South Africa. Besides securing crude oil reserves for the  country,  PetroSA
has an important role to play in the development  of  the  African  upstream
oil industry, thereby playing a crucial role in the development of Nepad.  I
have  previously  stated  that  Nepad  can  only  arise  on   the   economic
infrastructure that currently exists on the continent, the  core  industrial
activities of which are the minerals and energy complex and agriculture.

PetroSA positively contributes  to  the  economy  of  this  country  through
foreign  exchange  savings  of  more  than  US$1  billion  per   year.   The
restructuring of state assets into a viable  commercial  entity  means  that
the manufacturing plant in Mossel Bay will not have to  shut  down  in  2008
but has a life beyond 2020. This has important implications for  the  Mossel
Bay area.

Commercialisation  means  that  this  company  would  pay  both  taxes   and
dividends to the fiscus and has already done so to the value of R2  billion.
The success of PetroSA would require that it  make  foreign  investments  in
other parts of the world, especially in Africa, for its  success.  The  bulk
of  the  profitability  of  most  global  oil   companies   occurs   through
exploration and production, with downstream only forming  some  30%  of  the
profits.

While initial expenditure for PetroSA's investment  might  require  capital,
it is imperative for the Government to take a long-term  view  when  looking
at the fruits of the investments for the country and the continent.  Reserve
Bank restrictions  on  investments  in  Africa  should  not  affect  PetroSA
negatively.  Government  would  have  to  facilitate  the   conditions   for
PetroSA's entry into crude oil producing markets.

In the final analysis, the ANC Government has turned a R11 billion  dinosaur
into a productive,  profit-generating  cash  cow.  This  experience  clearly
indicates that dinosaurs can fly. [Laughter.]
Minister, it is well known that during the apartheid  era  the  creation  of
Mossgas was premised on technology and  licensing  provided  through  Sasol.
This licensing arrangement occurred through the dictates of Mr  P  W  Botha.
It is equally well known that Sasol was created from billions of rands  from
Government funding and the privatisation of Sasol 3 occurred  under  dubious
circumstances during the apartheid era.

This   Sasol   licensing   agreement   on   PetroSA   is   restrictive   and
anticompetitive,  therefore  requiring  stern  Government  intervention   to
facilitate PetroSA's ability  to  market  petrochemicals  globally.  In  any
normal situation, after paying a licence fee or royalty, there should be  no
restriction on the  business.  Under  this  licensing  agreement  ...  [Time
Expired.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Thank you very  much,  Mr  Chairperson,
hon members and thank you very much  Tat'  uNash.  Bakuxolele  kodwa.  [They
have have forgiven you, but ... ]

Even though I would like to say nice things, because  most  of  the  members
have debated in a very helpful way, and have in general raised  things  that
we have answers for in a very positive manner, I have to take  on  Davidson.
INkosi ingangijezisa. [God may punish me.]

Mr Davidson rants and raves about the SA Diamond Board as if all the  things
that have happened there have not been because  of  our  initiatives.  There
was the Taljaard report, which was  a  result  of  the  work  initiated  and
carried out by the department. When we  noticed  the  problems,  we  changed
leadership. We appointed a very efficient chairperson. I donated one  of  my
own staff members when we had to fire the chairperson, who, by the way,  was
a person that Mr Davidson here, in this House,  used  to  defend  and  speak
for.

Mr I O DAVIDSON: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: I am surprised that you actually  think
he was problematic.  [Interjections.]  That  comes  as  a  surprise  to  me.
[Interjections.] Your type of questions  in  this  House  implied  that  you
actually wanted to protect the CEO of that time. [Interjections.]

So, I am surprised that now you have realised  that  we  have  had  to  take
action in order to restrain that individual from continuing to mess up  that
institution. You are also ... [Interjections.]  Well,  that  is  interesting
too. In any case, I would like to assure ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order!  We  can  only  have  so
many interjections.

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: I would like to assure the hon  members
that the SA Diamond Board is in safe hands, as  it  folds  up,  because,  in
accordance with the new dispensation, the role of that institution  will  no
longer be relevant. [Interjections.]

I also ... [Interjections.] Definitely, we will do that, and that is why  we
have taken action to punish those who  have  abused  the  resources  of  the
state. That is accountability. However, it takes time  as  we  research  and
investigate, because we will not  judge  people  without  having  taken  due
process.

I also want to address the issue of Eskom. The write-off  of  the  debt  has
happened in the context of the service  delivery  framework  agreed  between
Eskom and elected representatives and community-based organisations  in  the
Gauteng area that is supplied by Eskom. This is not  a  backdoor  agreement.
Some of these debts date back to the time  when  hon  Davidson  was  in  the
council of Johannesburg. [Interjections.] He messed it  up  thoroughly,  and
now we are saddled with obsolete technology and a  lot  of  inefficiency  in
the infrastructure. This is because at that time you  were  installing  that
technology and infrastructure for ``kaffirs''. You did not care. Now  it  is
the problem of Eskom, who have to sort this out.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon  Minister.  I  think
that word is unparliamentary, and I would ask you to withdraw that word.
Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, on a  point  of  order:  It  is  more  than  just
unparliamentary; she said it in a fit of temper  and,  quite  frankly,  that
kind  of   behaviour   from   a   Minister   is   absolutely   unacceptable.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  Minister,  would  you  please
withdraw that word?

The MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: I withdraw the word.

The specific issue that were raised by the hon member in relation to  Eskom,
for instance, is: Why focus on the central region? Eighty-seven  percent  of
national domestic debt is in this area. It is, therefore, a major source  of
concern for Eskom. What about similar deals elsewhere?

Eskom has not said that  it  will  not  discuss  the  matter  with  anybody.
Clearly Eskom will apply its mind so that it does not  encourage  a  culture
of defiance  regarding  people  who  have  no  cause.  The  people  of  this
particular area are victims of the likes of Davidson. That is why Eskom  was
willing to talk. But if others wants to talk, it has to be proven that  they
actually have the kind of problems that have forced Eskom to deal with  this
issue in the manner in which it has done in the central region.

I want to thank Mr Lucas for his encouraging words. I also  want  to  assure
you that within the month  of  June  we  will  announce  the  nuclear  waste
management policy. It is on its  way  to  Cabinet,  and  there  will  be  an
opportunity for this House also to deliberate on that.

I know members are concerned about  their  electricity  tariffs.  There  are
going to  be  ongoing  discussions  between  us,  the  NER,  Eskom  and  the
Department  of  Public  Enterprises.  I  am  also  aware   that   Eskom   is
overstretched in some way, but we clearly do not think that  the  poor  have
to bear the brunt of some of the challenges  that  we  face  in  the  energy
sector through Eskom.

A lot of encouraging words have been spoken, especially towards PetroSA.  We
appreciate that encouragement, as  PetroSA  is  a  new  institution.  It  is
already doing very well, but it does  have  challenges,  including  its  own
internal agent provocateur, as you have seen. We  need  to  investigate  the
kind of people that we  have  in  that  institution  who  could  be  causing
problems for us, so that appropriate action can be taken.

Comrade Ngcobo ... usirhabulisile, maqabane, ngomba  we-nuclear.  [Comrades,
Comrade Ngcobo has sensitised us about nuclear issues.] He gave us a lot  of
information ... enxalenye yalo ndingaluqondiyo  kakuhle  ...  [...  part  of
which I do not quite understand ...] but still this shows  you  the  quality
of the people that we have in the ANC. [Applause.] We  appreciate,  Comrade,
the amount of time you took to take us through the issues.

Comrades also raised a lot of issues  around  the  question  of  small-scale
miners. We do  have  quite  an  extensive  programme  that  is  evolving  in
relation to small-scale miners. Some of the programme  initiatives  that  we
have in that regard include our kaolin processing plant and ceramic  product
production in Ndwedwe, KwaZulu-Natal, our coal and brickmaking  project  set
in Indwe in the Eastern Cape, our dedicated diamond processing plant in  the
Northern Cape, and the full implementation of the  Phuthaditjhaba  sandstone
project and development of a slate quarry beneficiation facility  at  Gopane
in North West province.

So, comrades must be assured that we are dealing with  this  issue,  and  we
are very serious about it. Some comrades have also been concerned about  our
strategy for iron ore. I just want to emphasise that we intend to  keep  two
projects, as far as iron ore is concerned. We think that it is critical  for
job creation. For beneficiation, especially, it is Coega, as a port, and  we
think that it is also healthy for competition.

As far as manganese is concerned, we are not opposed to the  third  operator
in manganese. We are also expecting  much  more  and  intense  BEE  in  this
sector. We  also  are  expecting  greater  value  addition.  I  do  want  to
congratulate Total and Caltex, who are  new  companies  that  recently  have
announced partners as far as BEE is concerned. They have brought  a  variety
of partners into their mix and we welcome those new partners  who  are  also
going to be players in the liquid fuels. I am sure  Maurice  is  very  happy
that the work that they started is bearing so much fruit in this industry.

Comrades, I also want to  address  myself  just  quickly  to  the  issue  of
staffing within the department, and the fact that we need as many  resources
as we can to address that. This is why you see that in our budget  there  is
quite a big amount set aside for professional  services,  in  particular  in
the area of mining. The professional services are  also  for  rehabilitation
work, which, as you know, is very specialised  work,  and  we  tend  to  use
outside persons to do that work.

I once again want to thank  the  workers  for  the  continued  and  valuable
contribution and co-operation that we enjoy, in particular NUM. I also  want
to thank the actors in the industries, because even  when  we  disagree,  we
have found a way of disagreeing so we do not compromise  the  work  that  we
need to do for the people of South Africa. Of course  I  want  to  thank  my
colleagues, my staff in particular, for never sleeping on the job. They  are
effective, and they work very hard. I also want to thank you,  Essop.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  I  now  need  to
give a ruling. During  the  debate  on  the  implementation  of  the  floor-
crossing legislation on Thursday, 10 April 2003, the  hon  the  Minister  of
Defence raised a point of order, regarding a remark made by  the  hon  Mr  J
Selfe, with reference to the Premier of the Western  Cape,  Mr  M  C  J  van
Schalkwyk. I undertook to study the Hansard, and to rule on the matter at  a
subsequent sitting of the House. Having now had an opportunity to study  the
relevant Hansard, I wish to rule as follows. The contested  remark  was  the
following:


  He is a puppet premier: the useful idiot whose job it is to  deliver  the
  votes to the ANC, that the ANC itself cannot get.

[Interjections.] Order! Had the remark been addressed to a  member  of  this
House, it would have been regarded as unparliamentary and the  member  would
have had to withdraw it as, even given its historical origin, the remark  is
derogatory. However, Mr Van Schalkwyk is not a  member  of  this  House  and
therefore the remark does not have to be withdrawn.

During the debate I  reminded  hon  members  of  the  Speaker's  appeal  for
moderation and the use of moderate language. In general terms, I would  like
to repeat that appeal. Thank you.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 7 - Government Communication and Information System:

The  MINISTER  IN  THE  PRESIDENCY:  Thank  you  very   much,   Chairperson.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members, please. Those  who
are leaving, will you leave quietly without distrupting the  proceedings  in
this House. Order!

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Chairperson, hon members, may I,  with  your
permission, Chairperson, welcome two representatives from  the  multipurpose
community centres who are present here today with us.  They  are  Mr  Steven
Magagula from the Matsamo MPCC in Mpumalanga and Mrs Nombulelo  Majova  from
the Ipelegeng MPCC in Soweto, Gauteng. They are  joining  us  here  for  the
debate today. [Applause.]

Five years ago, with its first budget debate in this National Assembly,  the
Government Communication and Information System was launched.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, there can be  only
one speaker. Could I please insist on having  some  order.  Thank  you.  Hon
Minister, proceed.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Its task was  to  become  the  communication
agency of a government  leading  a  society  undergoing  reconstruction  and
development.

Its task was the antithesis of what had been  known  as  ``information''  in
the apartheid era. It was proactive instead of defensive, economical  rather
than  spendthrift,  soundly  accountable  instead  of  corrupt,  transparent
instead of secretive. It was a totally new era in information, in line  with
the democratic norms accepted by the nation in 1994, building on  the  first
moves out of the information morass immediately following our new order.

Five years later it is instructive to look back to the vision that  informed
the setting up of the GCIS, so that we can measure what  progress  has  been
made and what challenges remain. That vision was embodied in the  report  of
the Communications Task Team, which completed its work in 1996.

The directions Comtask mapped out and the values  it  proclaimed  are  still
our  guide.  Among  the  matters  that  Comtask   recommended   for   urgent
implementation were the setting up of  a  Media  Development  and  Diversity
Agency and a strategy for integrated international marketing.

Although it took longer than initially envisaged, the fact  that  these  two
agencies now exist and are working to promote  communication  objectives  of
reconstruction and development can be counted as a major achievement  and  a
cause for pride. They are significant milestones in our march to  a  healthy
and effective information system in  a  democratic  order.  It  is  a  great
pleasure that the first chairperson of the board  of  the  MDDA,  Ms  Khanyi
Mkonza, is present with us today. Welcome!

The vision that must guide us  in  assessing  what  has  been  done  and  in
measuring the challenges that  remain  is  that  of  a  nation  of  informed
citizens actively participating in improving their lives and  the  wellbeing
of  their  society;  of  a  society  in  which  the  rights  of  freedom  of
information and expression are enjoyed  concretely  by  all;  of  a  country
which has the informed respect of the peoples of the world.

That  vision  translates  into   strategic   priorities   for   Government's
communication  agency:  ensuring  effective  government  communication  that
empowers citizens to  become  agents  of  change;  helping  democratise  the
communications environment, broadening access to the means of acquiring  and
imparting information and ideas; and improving South Africa's image  in  the
world.

Addressing our legacy of imbalances in access to the means of  communication
is a complex and intricate process. Amongst these is the  transformation  of
the  marketing  and  advertising  industry.  The  GCIS,  together  with  the
Department of Communications and the Department of Trade and Industry,  took
up  the  challenge  which   the   parliamentary   Portfolio   Committee   on
Communications issued to Government and the private sector to work  together
to bring about change in an industry which has a critical role, not only  in
helping citizens engage with  the  marketplace,  but  also  in  shaping  our
conceptions of ourselves as a society.

The three departments have  finalised  a  report  which  will  serve  before
Cabinet with  proposals  for  the  development,  in  consultation  with  the
industry, of a  framework  for  transformation  in  line  with  Government's
strategy for broad-based empowerment.

Recently, representatives of industry bodies and  Government  together  took
part in a ceremony for the signing of a values statement expressing a  joint
commitment  to   the   achievement   of   a   marketing,   advertising   and
communications industry reflective of our democratic society.

A process that began amidst  considerable  mistrust  and  fragmentation  has
achieved a remarkable degree of consensus  on  the  direction  and  pace  of
change needed. Preparations are under way for a mid-year plenary meeting  to
review progress and set benchmarks.

Exactly one year and one day ago this House adopted  the  Media  Development
and Diversity Agency Bill, as ``one small but  significant  contribution  to
the task of  translating  the  aspiration  of  freedom  of  expression  into
actuality''.

The President appointed the MDDA board in  December,  after  work  had  been
done to consolidate the funding commitments by the  media  owners,  some  of
whom have shown exemplary support.

Since its first meeting in January the board has moved in a  purposeful  way
and set itself a timetable which  will  put  it  in  a  position  to  invite
applications for support  by  August.  It  will  therefore  begin  providing
support to community and small commercial media projects by the end of  this
year.

The GCIS has given all the support required  by  the  MDDA,  especially  the
kind of practical administrative support that is  critical  in  the  initial
start-up phase. Both the R3 million set aside  for  the  MDDA  in  the  GCIS
budget for last year and the R7 million for this financial  year  have  been
transferred to the MDDA.

The GCIS  is  also  facilitating  MDDA  interaction  with  other  Government
departments  -  in  particular  the  Department  of  Communications  -   and
parastatal agencies, so that  it  can  draw  practical  support  from  their
relevant programmes.

Compared with the start-up of  similar  agencies,  I  believe  the  MDDA  is
moving with  commendable  speed  under  the  guidance  of  its  chairperson,
reflecting the commitment of the  board  and  stakeholders  to  meeting  the
imperatives of  media  development  and  diversity  in  South  Africa.  This
diversity is cardinal to our success as a democratic society  in  which  the
people are empowered to make their own decisions on matters of the day.

The establishment of the MDDA, and the process  towards  the  transformation
of the marketing and advertising  industry,  are  pointers  to  progress  in
implementing strategic priorities identified by Comtask.

In the first nine years of our freedom - and the five  since  the  GCIS  was
established - the tide has turned. The scene has been  set  for  significant
further improvements in ensuring  that  our  attributes  as  a  country  are
appreciated in full measure.

Hon members will  by  now  be  aware  of  the  start  of  the  International
Marketing  Council's  Brand  South  Africa  campaign.  The  Chief  Executive
Officer of the International Marketing Council,  Yvonne  Johnston,  recently
briefed the Portfolio Committee on Communications on this campaign. The  IMC
itself is another good example of state-private co-operation.

As with all that we strive for, we start from  the  premise  that  effective
and lasting achievement of national objectives  is  possible  only  when  we
unite in action. Therefore the work to improve our country's  image  in  the
eyes of others begins with doing whatever we can as South Africans  to  live
the hope and refreshing possibilities that our country offers  to  the  rest
of the world.

The period of comprehensive and thorough planning has come  to  an  end.  As
the campaign begins to roll out it is attracting support by  the  week  from
individuals and organisations that seek to add their voice  to  the  message
that ours is a country alive with possibility. As  it  gathers  strength  we
will no doubt be hearing less and less from those South  Africans  who  feel
compelled to present our country in a negative light,  unlike  the  tourists
who come in increasing numbers; the  ratings  agencies  that  upgrade  their
assessment of our economy virtually every year; and the investors  eager  to
buy our Eurobonds and set up shop in South Africa.

The GCIS has also begun more systematically to develop  relations  with  our
counterparts in Southern Africa, in particular assisting the governments  of
Mozambique and Tanzania in initiatives  to  strengthen  their  communication
capacity while learning from their considerable experiences. The  department
also works with the Department of Foreign  Affairs  on  various  initiatives
relating to the AU, Nepad and SADC.

The most critical challenge which Comtask posed for the creation  of  a  new
Government communications and  information  system  was  to  strengthen  the
capability of Government to communicate its  policies  to  the  people.  Two
obstacles stood in the way: a lack of co-ordination and focus in  Government
communication; and a legacy of severe imbalances in access to information.

Government and the people are being brought closer together in a  number  of
ways. The roll-out of 60 multipurpose  community  centres,  MPCCs,  to  each
district in the country is now more than halfway done - 37 are  operational.
It is quite clear that these one-stop  centres  for  Government  information
and services are making an enormous  impact  on  the  lives  of  those  they
serve, mainly people who previously had little or no  access  to  Government
services. For such people the cost of transport, even  to  do  something  as
simple as getting a form to register a child's birth,  was  prohibitive  and
in many cases it still is.

For the next phase we should hope to work towards having an MPCC with a one-
stop Government centre  in  every  municipality.  How  to  achieve  this  is
something that is being worked on  by  the  Interministerial  Task  Team  on
Integrated  Service  Delivery.  We  are  also  convinced  that  this  is  an
initiative which can benefit from the participation of our social  partners,
and we  will  be  taking  it  to  the  Growth  and  Development  Summit  for
discussion.

A taste of things to come will be seen in the launch of the first  phase  of
the Batho Pele Gateway Project of  the  Department  of  Public  Service  and
Administration in the coming months. Six of the initial entry points to  the
Government Batho Pele Gateway will be located in MPCCs.  That  includes  the
Tombo MPCC in the Eastern Cape, the first such to be launched in 1999-2000.

Direct interaction between the executive, in all  spheres,  and  the  public
has been increased by the rapid growth of the imbizo programme since it  was
initiated by President Mbeki in the Limpopo province in April  2001.  Public
enthusiasm for the opportunity to interact directly with the  executive  has
seen the National Imbizo Focus Weeks  expand  from  170  events  in  October
2001, to 300 in April 2002, 320 in November  2002  and  over  350  in  April
2003.

If one adds to this the imbizo visits to  provinces  by  the  President  and
Deputy President  and  the  almost  continual  outreach  programmes  of  the
provincial executives, it is clear that izimbizo  are  becoming  central  to
Government communication, and an  essential  feature  of  the  participatory
democracy taking root in our country.

To cope with the challenge of processing concerns that are  not  immediately
dealt with as they  are  raised,  the  GCIS  is  developing  an  information
management system to improve follow-up and feedback.
On the other hand, the direct interaction of the executive  and  the  public
through imbizos is already making an  impact  on  governance.  This  affects
both the detail of implementation and the direction of  policy  itself.  For
example,  the  experience  of  imbizos  helped   shape   various   important
initiatives - to cite some examples: to introduce an  echelon  of  community
development workers into the Public Service; to speed up the  programme  for
the improvement of rural  roads;  to  introduce  the  ``Know  your  rights''
campaign on water services by the Minister of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry;
and to facilitate the decision to introduce Public Works programmes  in  the
Bekkersdal area in Gauteng.

Also, part of the effort to  provide  all  South  Africans  with  access  to
information about their Government has been  the  shift  towards  media  and
modes of  communication  which  research  shows  to  be  more  effective  in
reaching wider sections of the population.

An example is the wave of publicity following the President's state  of  the
nation address. Whereas in 2002 newspaper  advertisements  absorbed  70%  of
the cost, this was 32% in 2003 - the media used has  shifted  towards  radio
and other forms of direct distribution. Part of the shift was a  live  link-
up with 48 community  radio  stations  for  the  President's  address;  live
broadcasts through  the  ``Big  Screen''  programme  to  58  community-based
imbizo events at MPCCs and other  satellite  points.  In  consultation  with
organisations representing people with disabilities, information  about  the
programme of action is being disseminated in Braille and on tape.

Parallel to these efforts to extend access  to  Government  information  has
been attention to the other side of the coin highlighted by Comtask  -  more
co-ordination and focus in government communication. This has  been  pursued
by consolidation of the integrated Government-wide system  of  communicators
who are clustered to match the clustering of Government.

Steps are also being taken to enhance communication capacity  in  the  local
sphere  of  government,  following  the  first-ever  conference   of   local
government communicators hosted by Salga in June 2002  with  the  assistance
of the GCIS.

Strategic  guidance  of  Government  communication  by  Cabinet   has   been
strengthened in two ways. The first is  more  active  oversight  by  Cabinet
committees of the implementation  of  cluster  communication  strategies  as
part of their general oversight of the work of clusters. The second  is  the
continuation  of  Cabinet's  discussion  of  current  affairs  also  from  a
communications perspective, a practice whose  introduction  I  noted  during
last year's debate on the GCIS Budget Vote.

The positions adopted by Cabinet on  all  matters  of  public  interest  are
communicated not only through the regular statements  issued  and  briefings
given after each Cabinet meeting, but are  also  disseminated  by  the  GCIS
more widely through Bua Briefs to opinion-makers in the private sector.

Though there is still a long way to go, clear progress  has  been  made.  At
the heart of all  the  communication  campaigns  have  been  the  themes  of
partnership and shared responsibility - Letsema and Vukuzenzele -  in  order
to  build  on  the  progress  made   as   a   foundation   for   accelerated
implementation.

Trends in public opinion  compared  to  previous  years  suggest  that  such
communication is consistent with the public mood. In turn, this matches  the
evidence of the impact that Government programmes are making  on  the  lives
of South Africans.

As such, the empty vessels who make noise about our people being  worse  off
now than under apartheid serve not only to expose their ignorance, but  also
their disgraceful yearning for a past that  shall  never  return.  That,  we
should remember, was a time when the majority of the population  was  locked
out of every significant aspect of South African life.

Since the Sanef-Cabinet Indaba two years ago much has been done  to  develop
the relationship between media and Government in ways that should lead to  a
better understanding of Government policies and  programmes.  No  doubt  the
recent establishment of the Presidential Press Corps  will  make  a  further
contribution in that direction. Already,  numbers  of  briefings  have  been
held which have helped to throw light on  important  issues  and  strengthen
communication between the Presidency and the media.

This has been a brief overview of work that has been done by the  GCIS  over
the past five years, and  the  past  year  in  particular,  to  achieve  the
strategic priorities it was assigned by Cabinet in the light of the  Comtask
report.  In  doing  this  work  the  GCIS  made  use  of  the  public  funds
appropriated for this purpose by this House.

Taking into account the R1,6 million in funds already committed  during  the
financial year, which the National  Treasury  has  been  requested  to  roll
over, the GCIS effectively used all its  allocated  funds.  Should  National
Treasury not approve the roll-over request, the GCIS would  have  spent  99%
of its funds.

The budget for the financial year 2002-03 was  R153,7  million  -  including
allocations to the IMC and MDDA - rising to R176 million  in  2003-04.  That
compares with R60,2  million  for  the  first  year  in  1998-99.  For  this
increase, reflecting  the  fact  that  the  GCIS  has  been  entrusted  with
additional functions, we should thank the National Assembly.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, your time has expired.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: What's that?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your time has expired.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: No. Please,  Chairperson,  a  Minister  must
have the right to finish his input. [Interjections.]

What has  been  achieved  during  these  past  five  years  to  improve  the
communication environment; to improve  South  Africa's  international  image
... [Interjections.]
An HON MEMBER: Chairperson ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Unless, Minister,  you  want  to  take
from the latter part of your time?

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: I shall do so, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I'll give you  the  five  minutes  and
we'll reduce that time.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Yes, you will do so.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, proceed.

The  MINISTER  IN   THE   PRESIDENCY:   You   will   do   so,   Chairperson.
[Interjections.]

Do you still have something to say?

The   DEPUTY   CHAIRPERSON   OF   COMMITTEES:   Proceed,    hon    Minister.
[Interjections.]
The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: No, sit down, man. You are just like a jack-
in-the-box. Ufuna ntoni wena? [What do you want?]

...  to  strengthen  Government  communication  and  to  broaden  access  to
Government information has played a part - small, no doubt, but  significant
- in contributing to the general progress in the lives of millions of  South
Africans that reflects the fact that indeed the tide  has  turned.  This  is
increasingly being recognised by informed opinion locally and abroad.

With the funds allocated for the year 2003-04, the GCIS intends to build  on
the progress made towards the realisation of the  vision  of  a  society  of
informed citizens who  were  their  own  liberators  and  are  now  actively
engaged in changing their  lives  for  the  better  -  building  a  people's
contract for a better South Africa.

In this achievement, Parliament, and in particular the  Portfolio  Committee
on Communications, has been an invaluable partner and guide,  and  I  should
like to commend the deft and dedicated way  its  chairperson,  the  hon  Nat
Kekana, has conducted himself,  sometimes  in  difficult  circumstances  and
amid heavy attacks from certain quarters, now that he is moving  on  to  new
pastures. I hope they are as nice for him there as it was here. We wish  him
well as he deploys his considerable skills, though still  in  the  cause  of
communication.

Lastly, I should like to place on record my thanks to the GCIS for the  work
so well done, and particularly to the CEO, Mr  Joel  Netshitenzhe,  for  his
indefatigable efforts.

I take this opportunity to commend the GCIS Budget to the House. I do so  by
noting the remark by Bacon that ``Knowledge is power,'' adding  the  thought
that ``Democratic power is knowledge''. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr N N KEKANA: Thank you hon members and  thank  you,  Minister,  for  those
words of encouragement.

I rise to support, on behalf of the ANC, the budget of the GCIS. I  am  also
speaking at this podium for the last time in my capacity as the  Chairperson
of the Portfolio Committee on Communications and a member of  Parliament.  I
have submitted my letter of resignation to the Speaker and to  the  Whippery
of my organisation, the ANC.

I believe that this  is  an  appropriate  juncture  at  which  to  make  the
transition from the public sector to the  private  sector.  I  have  been  a
member of Parliament since 1994 and I will forever value  the  experience  I
have gained and the honour I have had  to  be  able  to  contribute  to  the
building of such a vibrant democratic institution as our Parliament.

Whilst a lot still needs to be done to create greater access  to  Parliament
for all South Africans, especially those in rural communities,  I  am  proud
to have been part of a hard-working and committed team to make a  difference
and bring about fundamental changes to the lives of our people. It  is  with
regret that I will no longer be  part  of  these  dedicated  cadres  of  our
people. But, it is also with eagerness and anticipation that I look  forward
to a new challenge and to continuing to make a difference for a better  life
for all in my new position.

I thank you all for the camaraderie you have shown me  over  the  years  and
for everything you have contributed to my growth and  development.  In  this
Chamber we have had moments of friendship and animosity,  joy  and  sadness,
elation and disappointment, but mostly we have shared  moments  of  victory.
We have sung and toyi-toyied. Every debate we have had  in  this  House  and
every piece of legislation we have passed through this House has  helped  to
create a better life for all South Africans.

What we have been doing  here  has  been  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. I am very proud to have been part of such a team,  and  wherever  I
go I have no doubt that we will continue to  work  together  as  we  have  a
common goal, that is, the deliverance of a democratic, nonracial,  nonsexist
and prosperous South Africa.
For the record, let me state that I am neither leaving  politics  nor  being
forced for whatsoever reason to quit  Parliament.  My  experience  here  has
been invaluable and I will be forever grateful for what I have  learnt  from
it and the humility I have gained through it.

However, having  been  here  since  the  first  sitting  of  our  democratic
Parliament in 1994, the decision to leave, nearly 10 years on, comes  simply
in the  normal  course  of  reflection  upon  one's  life  and  seeking  new
challenges, and needing to contribute to transformation in another arena.

We all  have  the  responsibility  to  build  a  photo  album  which  future
generations can page through, reflect upon, learn from and be  inspired  by.
Future generations will fill in the gaps left by our photo images  and  they
might sometimes wonder why certain decisions were  taken.  It  is  therefore
our responsibility to  explain  our  communications  and  messages  for  the
benefit of generations to come.

The GCIS, under the capable leadership of its CEO,  Joel  Netshitenzhe,  and
guidance by the Minister in the Presidency, Comrade Essop  Pahad,  has  made
great strides in simplifying such messages and building photo images of  our
own experience as a democracy.

It is important that our portfolio committee, in  particular,  continues  to
raise issues pertaining  to  the  imagery  captured  by  photographers,  and
reporters in newspapers, as well as the coverage on  radio  and  television.
Neither  should  we  shy  away  from  creative  criticism  nor  hesitate  to
criticise where criticism is necessary. Constructive criticism can help  and
guide in nation-building. It can be an  important  yardstick  of  a  healthy
democracy. That is the lesson I have learnt from being in the  communication
industry over the past 23 years.

Like the epigram which says, ``a picture  paints  a  thousand  words'',  the
word ``Oceania'' might ring a bell. If you are a soccer fan it might  remind
you of the evaporation of a dream, the hosting of the 2006 Soccer World  Cup
by South Africa. A certain Mr Dempsey, by abstaining, snatched the hopes  of
the entire African continent to host this prestigious event  for  the  first
time in the history of the beautiful game. As we once more attempt  to  host
the World Cup, we should again be mindful of the world around us.

We might not know what happened in the Dempsey saga, but please allow me  to
suggest an explanation.  His  attitude  to  the  African  continent  was  no
different from that of his colonial ancestors to the indigenous  peoples  of
Oceania.

The leader of the opposition, hon Tony Leon, displays from time  to  time  a
similar attitude to  the  continent  of  Africa  as  that  of  Dempsey.  For
example,  his  selective  quotations  and  distortions  of  the  President's
address to the All-Africa Editors' Conference,  convened  by  SANEF,  is  an
attempt to sustain the negative coverage of the African  continent.  If  you
read the President's speech at  this  conference,  there  was  nothing  that
suggested, as Mr Tony Leon wrote in the Cape Times, that the  President  was
taking a ``swipe at his criticism and questions their intellect.''

The President's speech, to Mr  Tony  Leon's  dismay,  was  welcomed  by  the
participants.  The  speech  was  a  responsive  way  to  challenge   African
journalists and  editors  to  improve  the  quality  of  journalism  on  our
continent.

The President suggested that the South African media  has  a  responsibility
to report Africa to the South Africans, and carry  out  this  responsibility
as Africans. He said that complaints from other  African  journalists  about
the distorted reporting of the SABC about their own countries does not  mean
that those reports should not be critical, but  rather  that  they  must  be
truthful and not false and uninformed.

Embedded journalism, as experienced in the intervention in Iraq, is  nothing
new. You just have to read the writings of Chomsky and others to  understand
how journalism has been used as part of  a  military  strategy  to  win  the
hearts and minds of people. The overwhelming scale  and  ruthless  execution
of the US-led military strategy, accompanied by the embedded propaganda,  no
doubt helped to achieve  the  objectives  which  Business  Week  termed  the
``computer combat''. The biased news bulletins  will  surely  make  Goebbels
celebrate in his hellhole  the  implementation  of  his  doctrine  of  naked
propaganda.

What embedded journalism means to Sky, the BBC  and  CNN  is  nothing  other
than the furtherance of their countries' national interests, as  defined  by
the military commanders who led the invasion of  Iraq.  African  journalists
must not simply follow the editorial line of CNN and the BBC. They  must  be
proud to be African, celebrate the self-worth  of  the  African  people  and
must have no  hesitation  about  advancing  the  interests  of  the  African
continent and her peoples.

Recently I visited Australia to represent our  Parliament  in  an  important
discussion hosted by the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary  Association  and  the
World Bank. Our host, Australia, did everything possible to make  our  visit
productive and memorable. The 10  parliamentarians  forming  the  CPA  Study
Group on Parliament and Media agreed to and recommended a  reform  programme
to legal  and  institutional  obstacles  for  the  development  of  a  fully
informed  society  through  an  open  and  accountable  parliament   and   a
responsible media.

I firmly believe that, if implemented by all members of the  CPA,  the  work
done by the study group will go a long way in  improving  relations  between
the legislature and the media. However, this is not why  I  am  raising  the
Oceania issue in this debate.

My experience in Australia,  one  of  the  countries  of  Oceania,  left  me
somehow bewildered and desperately searching for answers as I  was  left  to
ponder what the plight of our people in South Africa  could  have  been  had
the ANC not been formed  to  challenge  apartheid  and  colonialism  in  our
country.

In Perth I could see no more than five indigenous  Australians  in  a  group
walking the city streets. Moreover, the only ones that I  saw  were  visibly
intoxicated  and  eventually  stopped  by  the  police  to   produce   their
identification documents, which reminded me of the days of the pass laws  in
South Africa.

What has happened to the indigenous people of Oceania is  best  captured  by
the photography presented in the publication titled  Portraits  of  Oceania.
In the publication, Brenda L Croft says something that is universally  true,
especially in the context of a colonially influenced media:


  Photography is  about  memories,  both  personal  and  collective,  about
  ``capturing'' and ``dislocating'' a  particular  moment  in  time.  Early
  photographs purported to be creating a historic record, though many  were
  often falsely staged.

Having been raised within a Methodist/Wesleyan religious tradition, it  came
as a  shock  to  me  to  discover  that  many  of  the  photographs  in  the
publications are ascribed by  one  of  the  colonial  photographers  to  the
influence of the religious vision of  the  Wesleyan  missionaries.  Wesleyan
missionaries, such as a  certain  George  Brown,  photographed  dehumanising
images of the people of Oceania, and contributed to the humiliation  of  the
nation.

The degradation of women and the undignified manner in  which  the  colonial
photographers captured images  of  the  indigenes  distorted  the  true-life
experiences and stories of the people of Oceania.  The  blatant  racism  and
sexist stereotypes and attitudes of the  colonial  photographers  were  also
duplicated right here on our continent. What we  ourselves  have  raised  in
many debates in this House about the state of the media in  our  country  is
no different from the what - Portraits of Oceania is illustrating.

The people of Oceania were  treated  no  differently  from  the  animals  on
display in a zoo. Incidentally, the Nazi killings  were  also  motivated  by
the notion that people are animals and therefore there  must  be  continuous
conflict to ensure elimination of the weakest.

Like the Saartjie Baartman experience, we were treated in exactly  the  same
way, with  the  same  attitude  and  same  racial  and  sexist  stereotypes.
However, the difference between the people of Oceania  and  us  is  that  we
were able to challenge colonialism before it could destroy  us,  undress  us
and take away our dignity. A human being without a  soul,  without  dignity,
self-respect and sense of self-worth is no different from an animal.

We have a responsibility to make a paradigm shift  to  fundamentally  change
the apartheid colonial mind-set. I  continue  to  urge  the  media  and  the
communication sector in our country to do some serious  soul  searching  and
to cleanse itself of  the  remnants  and  influence  of  our  apartheid  and
colonial past. We cannot continue to read and see  reports  about  ourselves
that seem to have been compiled by tourists.

This tourist journalism, including the denigrating  profiles  and  mercenary
portraits  of  our  country  and  the  African  continent,  cannot  be  left
unchallenged. It is our responsibility to  be  critical  of  media  coverage
that degrades our people and paints distorted pictures of  our  country  and
the African continent.

The tendency to prevent us from articulating our criticism of the media  is,
according  to  one  of  the  publication's  contributors,   Michael   Hayes,
reminiscent of the Senator McCarthy trials in the  US  in  the  fifties.  He
observes that there is a vocal group that claims that such  arguments  under
the pretext of political  correctness  censor  free  speech  and  individual
rights.

The leader of the opposition and his followers belong to  this  small  group
in our country. It is  our  responsibility  to  raise  media-related  issues
openly without fear of prejudice  or  contradiction,  or  indeed  the  often
pronounced accusation that we are attempting to suppress  media  freedom  in
our country.
This  Parliament  has  shown  the  way.  Our   discussion   and   subsequent
intervention has led to a healthy and robust debate within  the  advertising
and  marketing  sector.  The  sector's  recently  issued   value   statement
represents a breakthrough in addressing racism and  the  negative  influence
of our past. We are confident that the industry has shown  a  commitment  to
change. We are also aware that the transformation challenges  are  huge  and
require industrywide common purpose and a united front for change.

Individual marketers, and this includes Government, must follow the lead  of
the consumers and together with advertising agencies  and  the  media  reach
out in  search  of  a  South  African  soul  and  identity.  Our  media  and
communications must capture our values, morals and experiences  as  Africans
living on the great continent of Africa.

For those who might not know, Comrade Walter Sisulu called for  the  freedom
of the airwaves in the sixties at the height  of  apartheid  and  oppression
and suppression of all views different from the racist  mind-set.  By  doing
this, he was following the tradition of all the leaders of the ANC who  came
before him, including the founder members who were themselves journalists.

We should be grateful that we  had  leaders  like  tata  Walter  Sisulu  who
sacrificed everything and helped  build  a  long-lasting  freedom  monument,
free of racism and segregation. I am proud to belong to an organisation  led
by comrade, leader, isithwalandwe [recipient of  ANC  award],  tata  Sisulu.
The blood of the ANC runs in my veins and I  will  always  be  dedicated  to
this organisation.

One of the first things the ANC taught me was not to  take  our  people  for
granted, to respect them and always to  be  sensitive  to  their  views  and
needs. It is a lesson that I will cherish and nurture forever.

Tata Sisulu has been a model leader. I had  the  privilege  of  experiencing
his guidance and humility when I worked under his  leadership  in  the  1994
elections campaign. I will always value those moments.

It has been a great honour for me to be a member  of  this  House.  I  would
like to thank my family and my kids for putting up with the long  hours  and
instability that comes with the work of being  a  parliamentarian.  I  would
also like to thank everyone for the support and friendship over  the  years.
I wish all of you good health and best wishes for the future. Also,  to  the
GCIS and its leadership, it is five years in three days' time and all of  us
must agree that the GCIS is a  dynamic  and  efficiently  run  organisation,
therefore all of us must support this Budget Vote.  The  ANC  supports  this
Budget Vote and I thank you very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Colleagues,  Parliament  has  had  the
benefit of the talents and the dedication of the hon Kekana.  I  am  certain
that  you  will  join  me  in  wishing  him  well  in  whatever  venture  he
undertakes. Hamba kahle! [Goodbye!] [Applause.]
Mr V C GORE: Deputy Chair, allow me to begin my speech  today  by  saying  a
sad farewell to one  of  my  colleagues  in  the  portfolio  committee.  The
chairperson, Mr Kekana, will be leaving this House in  the  near  future  to
take up a position  at  Telkom.  He  has  ably  led  the  committee  through
potentially troubled  waters  of  the  broadcasting  and  telecommunications
industries. The hon Kekana has had to chart a very difficult course  between
dogmatic and outdated policies of the Government and  the  legitimate  needs
of the South African consumer and industry. Despite some very  bruising  and
robust encounters, the DA and myself would like to thank the hon Kekana  and
wish him well in his new position.

A notorious politician once remarked that ``people  will  more  easily  fall
victim to a great liar than to a small one''. The role and existence of  the
GCIS has always been controversial and  hotly  debated.  On  the  one  hand,
there is the legitimate need for citizens of this  country  to  receive  and
have access to reliable information about their  Government,  so  that  they
may become active participants in their own futures and,  more  importantly,
to hold their elected Government to account. On the other hand, there  is  a
justifiable fear that this function of the Government may be abused  to  the
extent that it simply becomes a propaganda machine,  spin  doctoring  a  few
successes by ignoring real issues  and  dismantling  the  critical  wall  in
democracy between the ruling party and the state.

Hon members, the CEO recently told the portfolio committee that the role  of
the GCIS was to correct the mistaken view that the poor are  worse  off  now
than they were during the apartheid years. South Africans  are  expected  to
accept, therefore, that the role of  the  GCIS  is  to  spend  R176  million
employing over 300 people, indoctrinating people  into  believing  that  the
shack that they are living in today is better than the shack that they  were
living in prior to 1994 ... [Interjections] ... that it is  acceptable  that
crime has stabilised and that HIV does not  cause  Aids.  Despite  what  the
GCIS says, the prevalent problems confronting this country are poverty,  the
HIV/Aids pandemic and crime.

The facts speak clearly for themselves. One out of three South  Africans  is
unemployed. Seven million people are out of  work.  Black  unemployment  has
risen from 46% in  1995  to  55%  in  the  year  2001.  Billions  of  social
development rands are rolled over unspent  from  year  to  year,  while  two
thirds of existing child support grants go unclaimed. Hundreds of  thousands
of South Africans are dead and millions more are to die  from  HIV/Aids  ...
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: What are you doing for those people?

Mr V C GORE: It is simply not good enough to explain shallow  claims  of  no
delivery and increasing poverty on partial data and focus on single  points,
as Mr Netshitenzhe wants this country to  believe.  Even  the  Human  Rights
Commission, in its reports on  economic  and  social  rights,  unequivocally
stated that the ANC-led Government has failed on its 1999 election  campaign
promise to deliver a better life for all. The ANC's flawed  counterarguments
and ridiculous assumption that  the  social  wage,  tax  relief  and  social
grants  compensate  for  lack  of  delivery  simply  does  not  hold  water.
[Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Uya  kukubetha  uThixo.  ...  [Ngokungavakaliyo.]  [God  will
chastise you ... [Inaudible.]]

Mr M M CHIKANE: Mr Chairperson, on a point of order: I would  like  to  know
if the hon member is prepared to take a question?

Mr V C GORE: I will answer if I get time.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: No, that's not a point of order.

Mr V C GORE: What this country needs  and  what  this  country  demands  are
jobs. Jobs to feed, jobs to educate and jobs to house.

As this country prepares itself for an election next  year,  the  GCIS  will
play a critical role in delivering the facts to all South Africans, and  not
opinion. The role of the GCIS is to be the messenger and not to  become  the
interpreter and manipulator of the message  to  achieve  a  specific  public
image. Misinformation, disinformation and no information  has  no  place  in
South Africa's democracy. [Applause.]

Ms M R MORUTOA: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  Deputy  Minister,
hon members of Parliament, I dedicate this speech to all our  late  founding
leaders of the ANC such as Dube, Sol Plaatjie and Govan Mbeki, who  was  the
editor of the New Age.

If you care to know, most of the ANC leaders were editors of newspapers  and
journalists.  These  comrades  were  all  journalists  who  influenced  this
movement  so  that  we  can  be  critical  of  the  need   for   information
dissemination to the people on the ground. This shows how committed the  ANC
is to freedom of speech and access to  information,  unlike  the  opposition
parties who are making it something fashionable nowadays.

It was the apartheid  regime  that  removed  advertisements  and  government
notices from all progressive newspapers like the New Age.  As  the  ANC,  we
need to look back seriously and think carefully about where  we  come  from.
Transformation today is happening at such a fast pace. Sometimes we need  to
reflect carefully upon our past and think of  all  the  milestones  we  have
gained through our struggle for liberation for our  fellow  South  Africans.
When I do this, I cannot help but commend the ANC  for  its  leadership  and
vision when it launched the Freedom Charter in 1955.

The ANC has always stood  for  freedom  of  expression  and  for  access  to
information. In 1956 the assertion of freedom of expression  and  access  to
information in the Freedom Charter inspired the women  of  South  Africa  to
network and organise themselves. They disseminated  information  across  the
length and breadth of the country for women to protest against  the  dreaded
pass laws. On 9 August  of  that  year  this  culminated  in  20  000  women
marching to Pretoria to submit a memorandum to the then  prime  minister  Mr
Strjdom, in  which  they  expressed  their  refusal  to  carry  passes.  The
placards that were carried by the women were handwritten.  The  slogans  and
photographs gave a message to all South Africans and this gave birth to  the
slogan ``wathint' abafazi, wathint' imbokodo. Uzokufa''.[If you  strike  the
woman, you strike the rock. You'll die.]

When we reflect and look back nearly 10 years upon what  we  inherited  from
the apartheid state  in  terms  of  the  state  information  and  propaganda
machinery, we will instantly  see  what  the  GCIS  had  to  go  through  in
transforming this machinery. The South African Communication Service,  Sacs,
the information machinery of the former apartheid regime, denied the  public
access and quality information  from  Government.  Its  lifespan  eventually
came to an end. The long-awaited transition of the Sacs into a  body  to  be
named the Government Communication and Information System, began.
The GCIS drew its mandate from section 16  of  the  Bill  of  Rights,  which
guarantees all citizens freedom of speech. The GCIS was to  focus  on  broad
priorities such  as  establishing  a  coherent  Government  system  and  the
development of an information network to service grass-roots  needs;  hence,
in the spirit of pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty  and  focusing  on
making the lives of South Africans better, the ANC-led  Government,  through
the  GCIS,  established  a  number  of  multipurpose  community  centres  in
different provinces.

This was meant for communities to access information  on  services  provided
by Government departments so as to make it convenient  for  ordinary  people
in our communities to apply for birth certificates and  identity  documents.
This will also enable South Africans to  access  child  grants  and  pension
grants more readily. Some of the centres assist their  clients  to  fill  in
forms for the Unemployment  Insurance  Fund,  the  UIF,  so  that  they  are
registered as job seekers.

To name just  a  few  of  these  centres,  there  is  one  in  Gauteng,  the
Ipelegeng, and Mamelodi, and Namahadi in the Free  State,  Lerethlabetsi  in
the North West province, and Bhamshela in  KwaZulu-Natal.  In  Sedebeng  the
GCIS has gone into partnership with a  film  resource  unit.  The  two  have
embarked on implementation of the MPCC's audiovisual  education  initiative.
This is aimed at empowering two multipurpose community centres  in  Sebokeng
and  Lebotlwane  for  disseminating  pertinent  information  by   projecting
audiovisual material.

The GCIS, through the MPCCs, conducts awareness and  educational  programmes
on HIV/Aids programmes. However, we also need  to  ensure  that  these  MPCs
will be sustainable over the long term.

Sekela-sihlalo,   ukuba   abanye   bethu   kule    Ndlu    yoWiso    Mthetho
banokuyikhumbula  kakuhle  into  esasiyenziwa   ngurhulumente   wocalucalulo
ngeminyaka yoo-1956, kwakukho amaqumwana  awayebizwah  ngolokuba  zii`mobile
unit'  ezazihamba  kulo  lonke  eli  loMzantsi  Afrika,  besinyanzela  ukuba
sithabathe  amapasi.  Into  eyayisenzeka  ke  apho  kukuba  abantu   abakula
maqumrhu bathatyathwa kwindawo eyodwa, apha kule ndawo eyayibizwa  ngelokuba
yiTransvaal ngelo xesha.

Phaya kweliya lizwe lakwaXhosa bashiya bemoshile abo  bantu,  ngenxa  yokuba
kaloku ulwimi ababelithetha lalingaqhelekanga,  ukutsho  ke  ndithetha  into
yokuba babengavani ngentetha, ngoko  ke  amagama  abantu  babewathelekelela.
Umzekelo waloo nto ngulo; ukuba igama lakho nguSontonga,  babeza  kulinqumla
ke bona, ube nguSononga. Liya kuhlala linjalo  ke  ude  uwushiye  lo  mhlaba
igama epasini lakho linguSononga, ngenxa yokungavani ngeelwimi.

Ukanti  naseRhawutini  apho,  kulaa  ndlu  ebifudula   iyi`Native   Affairs'
kwaNdaba Zabantu, eyona  ndlu  enkulu  kwisitalato  iBezuidenhout  neMarket,
yayisisiphithiphithi  into  ebisenzeka  apho.  Imitshato   kunye   neminyaka
yokubeleka  kwabantu  yayingabhalwa  ngokufanelekileyo.  Kangangokuba,   uya
kufumana umntu olingana nam lo incwadi  yakhe  yesazizi  ixela  into  yokuba
uzelwe ngonyaka u-1962,  nto  leyo  ethetha  ukuba  uba  yintanga  yomntwana
olingana nalo wam wesithathu. Yonke ke le nto iqhagamshelana  nobunzima  oza
kubufumana mhla ufuna ukubhalisela  inkamnkam  yakho,  kufumaniseke  okokuba
ulusana kodwa ololupheleyo ebusweni.

Into  ke  eyayisisimanga  kukuba  sasingadibani  nabebala  apho.  Bona  babe
neendawo zabo apho bangamiyo khona  nasemgceni  apho.  I-GCIS  iya  lwandisa
ulwazi lwabemi baseMzantsi Afrika, yenza impilo yabo ibe lula kakhulu.

Sekela sihlalo ... (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Deputy  Chairperson,  if  other  people  in  the  National  Assembly  could
remember exactly what the apartheid government used  to  do  to  us  in  the
1950s, there were small units called the mobile units,  that  travelled  all
over South Africa, forcing us to have passes.  What  would  happen  is  that
people who were employed in these units came from a certain area, which  was
called the Transvaal in those days.

This messed things up in the Eastern Cape because the  language  they  spoke
was unusual, that is to say  that  they  did  not  understand  one  another,
therefore they just guessed our names. One example is  this:  if  your  name
were Sontonga, they would shorten it and call  you  Sononga.  You  would  be
Sononga on your pass until you died, because of a language barrier.

In the Native Affairs office in Gauteng - the head  office  at  Bezuidenhout
and Market Streets - it would be  a  commotion.  Marriage  years  and  birth
dates were not recorded correctly. You could even find a person as old as  I
am with her birth date recorded as 1962, the same year my  third  child  was
born. This would later pose a problem when you had to apply  for  a  pension
grant, and you would find that  you  are  actually  a  very  old  baby  with
wrinkles all over your face.

What is surprising is that we  did  not  mix  with  the  so-called  coloured
people there. They used to go to secluded places where  they  did  not  even
have to stand in queues. The GCIS  disseminates  information  to  and  about
citizens of South Africa, and makes their lives easy.

Deputy Chairperson ...]

... I would like to thank the chairperson  of  this  committee,  hon  Nkenke
Kekana, for the gracious way in which he has managed all  the  processes  in
this committee. He always allowed  members  to  express  themselves  freely,
although they had differences of opinion. In the end, all parties were  able
to reach consensus on issues that were debated. I would also like  to  thank
Minister Essop Pahad and the CEO, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, for  their  sterling
work in transforming an oppressive apartheid  propaganda  machinery  into  a
Government system that informs and services all South Africa's citizens.

The tide has turned. With every year that passes  we  can  see  the  visible
fruits of hard work of the people in our Government. [Time expired.]

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, the Inkatha Freedom Party would first of  all  like
to say thank you, farewell, and offer  our  very  best  wishes  to  the  hon
Nkenke  Kekana,  the  chairperson  of  the  portfolio  committee,  for   his
friendship and his competent leadership of this committee. We are all  going
to miss you terribly, Nat. We have worked  together  for  many  hundreds  of
hours over the years, and we have had many  challenging  and  tension-filled
moments, over many very difficult pieces of legislation in  which  you  have
often facilitated constructive compromise. We really hugely appreciate  your
effort.

You are leaving us for Telkom, and there is no doubt that the knowledge  you
have accumulated in the nine years you have been with  us  is  going  to  be
valued. Hamba kahle, Nat. [Goodbye, Nat.]

Now to the Budget Vote  of  the  GCIS.  In  any  year  before  an  election,
opposition parties all over the world get  nervous  about  and  focus  their
attention more than usual on all government  communication  and  information
systems, whatever they are called. We are no different in South  Africa.  It
is in the nature of politics that Government  communication  programmes  are
regularly stigmatised as propaganda, designed to enhance the  popularity  of
the ruling elite.

It is regrettable that the IFP  has  had  a  serious  example  to  hand,  as
evidence of such propaganda, and  how  an  organ  of  state  can,  in  fact,
attempt to rewrite history and demonise its  opponents.  The  South  African
Yearbook  2002-03  totally  misrepresents  the  role  of  the  IFP  and  its
president during the struggle for  liberation  in  our  country.  The  views
expressed are an insult to all members and supporters of the IFP,  and  they
dishonour our  dead,  whose  lives  were  sacrificed  in  our  struggle  for
democracy.

It is truly tragic, nearly 10 years after the ANC and the IFP saw  the  need
to work together and encourage national unity, and  to  strive  to  end  the
political conflict between our members,  that  such  dangerous  and  blatant
vilification of the president of the IFP, who happens to be  a  Minister  of
state in  this  Government,  could  be  so  blithely  included  in  such  an
important document of record. We would like to hear from Minister Pahad  how
this came about, and what he intends to do about it.

The fiscus-funded outreach to voters,  through  a  myriad  of  communication
programmes, and the GCIS has six at present, will always be  problematic  in
any multiparty democracy. Yet, at the same  time  it  is  obvious  that  any
democratic government must  communicate  with  its  citizens,  and  it  must
attempt to ensure that all sectors  of  society  have  the  widest  possible
access to reliable information about their government  and  its  programmes.
This is, of course, the brief of the GCIS, and in  the  five  years  of  its
existence, under the skilful leadership of its CEO,  Mr  Joel  Netshitenzhe,
there is no doubt that much has been achieved.

The IFP therefore  supports  this  Vote.  However,  we  continue  to  remind
ourselves and the GCIS, as we have done previously, of the hugely  sensitive
nature of its task, and  its  critical  importance  to  the  development  of
democracy in our  land.  The  key  issues  that  the  GCIS  has  identified,
including giving greater direction  to  Government  communications,  raising
the standard of Government communications, impacting on  the  communications
environment in South Africa, and ensuring that the GCIS develops  a  set  of
core competencies which its communicators must possess,  are  all  supported
by the IFP.

Finally, I wish to personally praise the staff at the GCIS  office  here  in
Parliament, who are unfailingly helpful and who greatly assist me, and I  am
sure many of you, with pamphlets and other wide ranges of  material  that  I
need for my own constituency outreach. They are doing a  wonderful  job  and
they deserve our praise. Thank you.

Mrs W S NEWHOUDT-DRUCHEN: Deputy Chairperson,  hon  members  of  Parliament,
the ANC supports the GCIS Budget Vote for 2003. Yes, we are  still  at  work
to make a better life for all  our  people  in  South  Africa.  In  our  ANC
resolution, we note that communication plays a major role in  deepening  our
democracy, promoting a culture of human rights, and that it is a key  pillar
in the transformation of our country.

The ANC-led Government wants  to  make  sure  that  all  Government  reports
communicated to the people  are  clear  and  simple  and  distributed  in  a
language that is understood by the people. Nation-building can  only  happen
if Government and the people can successfully communicate with  each  other.
Government's communication and information system is part of this, and  this
means that they need to make life better for all  South  Africans  in  South
Africa.

The legacy of apartheid resulted in many complaints from  people  at  grass-
roots level, stating that Government did not communicate  with  the  people.
There was no information about what Government was doing or saying, or  what
was going down to the people. For this the GCIS was established. The  GCIS's
vision is to make an  indispensable  and  widely  valuable  contribution  to
society and to work with Government by  meeting  Government's  communication
needs as well as those of the public.

Where does the need for communication come from?  When  the  President  gave
his state of the nation address, his speech also encouraged  the  public  to
participate in  Government  programmes,  such  as  the  volunteer  campaign.
Ministers  then  have  briefings  with  the  media  to  give  more  detailed
information about their departmental  programmes.  Out  of  the  President's
speech  comes  a  national  communication   strategy,   turning   Government
programmes into communication strategies.

Government also carries out research on the public's information  needs.  An
approach is then developed to provide  the  public  with  information  which
they can use to improve their  quality  of  life  while  at  the  same  time
empowering them with skills and information on how they  can  stand  up  and
use the information. It is important for our people to  work  together  with
our Government for a better life for all our people. In this report  of  the
portfolio committee the CEO of the GCIS stated that the GCIS, together  with
members of the committee, knows that South African citizens  must  have  the
widest access possible to reliable information about the Government and  its
programmes via the media in forms that they prefer.

This is needed  so  that  our  people  can  become  active  participants  in
programmes in order to improve their lives and the world that they live  in.
In so doing they can hold the Government accountable. The right  to  freedom
of expression, embracing the freedom of  the  press  and  other  media,  the
freedom to receive and impart information or ideas, should become a  reality
for all South Africans. The CEO went on to  mention  that  the  peoples  and
countries of the world should have reliable and accurate  information  about
the realities of our country, and the possibilities it offers.

This will therefore improve and strengthen partnerships with  the  GCIS  for
our own continent's development and growth. South Africans  should  be  able
to have a framework through which they can join  in  the  efforts  to  build
those partnerships with the rest of  the  world.  During  2001,  there  were
engagements between the ANC-led Government and the  South  African  National
Editors' Forum. Out of this engagement came the idea  of  the  establishment
of the Presidential Press Corps. This press  corps  is  an  opportunity  for
senior political writers to form a corps, whereby information and a  greater
understanding  of  the  work  of  our  Government  can   be   obtained   and
disseminated.

The presidential Press  Corps  has  weekly  briefings,  attended  by  senior
members of  Government,  including  the  President,  the  Deputy  President,
Ministers and DGs. Off-the-record and on-the-record briefings are held.  The
facilitation of the flow of information to the  public  is  done  via  these
briefings. For improved access to information, there will be  occasions  for
the members of the Presidential Press Corps to travel  with  the  President,
Deputy President and the Ministers, both within and outside South Africa.

The objective of the PPC is  therefore  to  improve  relations  between  the
media and the Presidency, as the  media  appear  to  frequently  get  things
wrong due to a lack of accurate background information. These briefings  are
designed to be both on and off  the  record  so  that  at  least  background
information can  be  made  available  to  the  media  to  facilitate  better
understanding. Since the Presidential Press Corps has  been  launched  there
have been various meetings, such as with Minister Zuma  on  the  development
in Zimbabwe, briefings by  the  Minister  of  Labour  and  trade  unions  in
preparation for the GDS, and briefings by the President  when  meeting  with
religious leaders.

The GCIS is also tasked with the responsibility of  meeting  people,  giving
workshops on Government communications and listening to  the  needs  of  the
people. Let me give one example. I recently  had  the  opportunity  to  take
part in one of the GCIS workshops during the constituency period last  week.
I was invited to give a presentation at Indaleni  School  for  the  Deaf  in
Richmond, KwaZulu-Natal. At the workshop, the GCIS had  the  opportunity  to
listen to the needs of the pupils at the school.

In time, I hope that the GCIS will make sure that those needs will  be  met,
which does not only include making sure that they are able to obtain  better
education, but also seeing to  the  basic  needs,  namely  information.  The
school, which includes a hostel, also has one tap for  their  water  supply.
They need more pipes and taps for their  water  supply.  This  is  just  for
information's sake.

I am happy to reply that the GCIS is making progress in making  things  more
accessible to people  with  disabilities.  The  2003  state  of  the  nation
address was for the first time  published  in  Braille.  The  South  African
Blind Organisation has published the shortened versions  of  the  speech  in
English and Afrikaans as a supplement in Braillorama, Briallorette,  Braille
Trumpet, Imfama and Blindaba. These are all newspapers for  people  who  are
blind. What is presently on Braille is all old information.

What we need now, is videos  for  the  deaf  that  are  subtitled.  We  need
Government to make TV more accessible to people who are deaf.  Yes,  I  want
to applaud the GCIS for making sure that programmes that they have are  more
accessible for the disabled people. I want to applaud them for their work.

I would like to end off  by  thanking  our  chairperson,  Comrade  Nat,  for
chairing and being the kind of person that he is. We will miss him  both  in
our portfolio committee as well as in the study group. I wish  you  all  the
best in your new job. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N S MTSWENI: Deputy Chairperson, hon  Minister,  Comrade  Pahad  and  hon
members, the ANC  supports  the  GCIS  Budget  Vote  because  the  GCIS  has
provided leadership in ensuring media diversity and development in order  to
improve media access to the formerly marginalised  groups  and  communities.
The role of objective, developmental and progressive media  is  critical  in
building an informed  citizenry,  which  is  the  foundation  of  a  vibrant
democracy.

I think it is only proper to appreciate and thank  the  hon  Minister  Pahad
and the CEO of the GCIS, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, and  their  staff  for  their
commitment, hard work and dedication in  ensuring  that  all  citizens  have
access to information on what Government is doing to ensure  a  better  life
for  all.  I  hope  hon  members  will  join  the  portfolio  committee   in
congratulating chairperson Nkenke  Kekana  for  being  honoured,  last  week
Friday, by the advertising industry as the advertising  personality  of  the
year. [Applause.]

My input will focus on the  progress  made  in  the  Media  Development  and
Diversity Agency and the language policy  of  the  public  broadcaster.  The
Media Development and Diversity Agency was established by Act 14 of 2002  as
an independent statutory  body  funded  by  Government  and  the  commercial
media. The main objective of the agency is to promote media development  and
diversity throughout the Republic.  It  aims,  among  others,  to  encourage
ownership and control of  and  access  to  the  media  by  the  historically
disadvantaged communities as well as by historically  diminished  indigenous
languages and cultural groups; to  build  capacity  through  development  of
human resources and training; to promote the  channelling  of  resources  to
communities, media and the small commercial media  sector;  and  to  support
initiatives which promote literacy and the culture of reading.

We welcome the appointment of the board and the CEO of the  agency.  We  are
confident that if they work as a collective they will rise to the  challenge
of realising the above-mentioned objectives. The ANC is calling  upon  local
communities, especially  in  rural  areas,  to  apply  for  community  radio
licences and to participate in the establishment of community newspapers  in
order  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  offered  by  the   Media
Development and Diversity Agency. In the spirit of  Vukuzenzele,  we  appeal
to our public representatives to assist these  marginalised  communities  in
establishing  the  community  media.  Asisukumeni   mavolontiya!   [Let   us
participate, volunteers!] A  re  emeng  mavolontiya.  [Let  us  participate,
volunteers.]

Our Constitution promotes the use of all  11  official  languages.  It  also
recognises the need to promote South African sign  language  and  the  Khoi,
Nama  and  San  languages.  South   Africa   faces   the   legacy   of   the
marginalisation  of  African  languages  on  the  one  hand   and   resource
constraints on the other. We pay tribute to one of  the  first  founders  of
the ANC who, having a vision and the courage  to  demonstrate  that  African
language  newspapers  are  also  viable,  established   Ilanga,   the   only
mainstream newspaper published in an African language.  Its  readership  has
been growing over the years. In 1998, for example, it had approximately  750
000 readers and by 2000 its readership had grown to 1,3 million. The  SABC's
research, done in  1996,  indicates  that  South  Africans  prefer  watching
television  in  their  home  languages,  notwithstanding  the  dominance  of
English on SABC TV.

There are approximately 3,5 million illiterate adults in South  Africa  with
the majority based in rural areas. Besides spreading information by word  of
mouth, the only means of accessing information for these adults  is  through
radio and television. The ANC believes that the  public  broadcaster  should
reflect the unity and diversity of our people and the needs of a  democratic
society. It should  promote  and  protect  all  official  languages  equally
through local content programming. In this respect we welcome  the  proposed
language-broadcasting  policy  of  the  SABC.  The  public  broadcaster  has
developed policies in seven different areas,  including  programming,  news,
language,  universal  service  and  access,  local  content,  religion   and
education. For the next four weeks the SABC will be engaging the  public  on
the policies through talk shows  and  discussion  programmes  on  its  radio
stations and television channels. We call upon all communities  to  actively
participate in  these  policy  discussions  or  submit  written  submissions
before 13 June 2003.

In conclusion, the GCIS has confirmed the  words  of  our  President:  ``The
tide has changed.'' They have created the opportunity for all our people  to
begin to enjoy the benefits of our hard-earned  freedom  in  the  fields  of
media.

Now to my chairperson: Kekana,  Tlou,  Mabulepu,  Mandebele  Maye,  akathomi
muntu athoma obathomako.  Sihlalo,  siyathokoza  baba.  Kokuthoma  sithokoza
indlela obegade uziphethe ngayo, nendlela obegade uphethe  thina  abakwa-ANC
ngayo. Ngibuye ngithokoze indlela ogade  uphethe  ikomidi  liloke  liphelele
ngayo. Angithathe  ithubeli  ngithokoze  nendlela  obegade  ukhambisa  ngayo
ikomidi lethu. Ngiyathemba bona akekho namunye  phakathi  kwethu  oyisolako.
Uhlangabezene nobunzima obunengi njengombana bese batjhwile abanye.  Kodwana
ngokubekezela  nangokuzinikela  ukwazile  ukobana  udlule   kilobo   bunzima
obugade bukhona. Kancani nje ngikhumbula  nasisekomidini  lokha  nasisebenza
ngokuphasisa  imithetho  namkha  sikhetha  khona  amabhodo.   Bekuba   khona
ukuhlangahlangana kodwana  ngoburholi  bakho  bewusiluleka  bona  sihlangane
neenqhema   eziphikisako,   sikhulumisane   besivumelane   khona    sizakuba
neenqubekela phambili. Siyathokoza baba,  Kekana.  (Translation  of  Ndebele
paragraph follows.)

[Kekana,  Tlou,  Mandebele   Maye,   akathomi   muntu   athoma   obathomako.
[Praising.] Firstly, I want to  thank  you  for  the  manner  in  which  you
carried yourself, and the way you treated us members of the ANC, and I  also
thank you for the manner in which you controlled the committee. Let me  take
this  opportunity  to  express  gratitude  for  the  way  you  directed  our
committee. I believe there is no one amongst us  who  can  doubt  that.  You
came across lots of difficulties, as other speakers have pointed  out.  But,
because of your perseverance and  commitment,  you  were  able  to  overcome
those difficulties. This brings to mind instances in the committee  when  we
passed Bills or when we selected board members. There were problems that  we
experienced, but because of your  leadership  qualities  you  were  able  to
advise us to work together with opposition parties, to debate and  to  agree
so that there could be progress. We thank you, Mr Kekana.]

The ANC supports this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Mev  ANNA  VAN  WYK:  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  die  Regeringskommunikasie-  en
Inligtingsstelsel is ná vyf jaar redelik op  dreef.  'n  Mens  kan  nie  met
alles saamstem nie, maar hierdie Regering  doen  ook  goeie  werk.  Daar  is
beduidende  bystand   aan   die   armes   beskikbaar,   en   dit   is   waar
regeringskommunikasie ter sprake kom. Verlede jaar het die  Minister  in  sy
toespraak  gesê  aan  die  einde  van   2003   sal   daar   60   veeldoelige
gemeenskapsentrums  wees.   Volgens   die   inligting   wat   ons   in   die
portefeuljekomitee ontvang het, is daar 36 en die jaar is amper halfpad.
Plattelandse inwoners,  en  ander  ook,  weet  grotendeels  nog  nie  watter
moontlikhede daar ter verbetering van hulle lewens is nie, en selfs  al  sou
hulle daarvan weet, kan hulle  nie  daarby  uitkom  nie.  Die  uitmergelende
gesukkel wat mense moet  verduur  om  gewone  regeringsdienste  te  kry  kan
eenvoudig nie so voortgaan nie. Hoe gouer al hierdie  sentrums  toegerus  en
beman,  elektronies  gekoppel  en  volledig  funksioneel  is,   hoe   beter.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs  ANNA  VAN  WYK:  Mr  Chairman,  the   Government   Communication   and
Information System is functioning reasonably  well  after  five  years.  One
cannot agree with everything, but  this  Government  also  does  good  work.
Significant aid is available to the  poor,  and  this  is  where  Government
communication comes into play. Last year the Minister  said  in  his  speech
that at the end of 2003 there would be 60  multipurpose  community  centres.
According to the information that we received in  the  portfolio  committee,
there are 36 and we are almost halfway through the year.

Rural inhabitants, and others as well, on the whole do not  yet  know  about
opportunities that exist for the improvement of their  lives,  and  even  if
they do, they cannot avail themselves of them. The exhausting struggle  that
people are subjected to in order  to  obtain  ordinary  Government  services
simply cannot go on like this. The sooner all  these  centres  are  equipped
and staffed, electronically connected and fully functional, the better.]

Recently the President admitted that his communications set up  by  the  hon
Minister and his department still had shortcomings. This goes for  the  rest
of Government as well. Many of the time-consuming misunderstandings  between
MPs and the executive,  between  Ministers  and  stakeholders,  between  the
state and the public could be avoided if communications were  smartened  up.
It is always tempting to blame the media and certainly they  are  not  above
criticism,  but  the  place  to  start  is  with  the  application  of   the
communications strategy and it seems to  me  that  the  most  obvious  place
would be Parliament.

Waarom is daar nog nie geslote toegewysde radio- en TV-kanale wat  aan  elke
skool,  gemeenskapsentrum,  oral  waar  regeringsdienste   aangebied   word,
beskikbaar is nie? Daar  moet  mense  kan  hoor  en  kyk  en  sien  wat  hul
Regering, hul Parlement en sy komitees doen en sê. Ons praat van  'n  enorme
aantal mense wat so bereik kan word.

So 'n netwerk moet dan gebruik word, en dan moet 'n mens natuurlik  ook  die
Kabinet en die staatshoof oorreed om die Parlement behoorlik te  gebruik  en
hulle aankondigings hier te doen eerder as elders. Maak  van  die  Parlement
die instelling wat hy behoort te wees en slaan sommer 'n paar vlieë met  een
klap dood.

Dan sou ons meer wees as 'n onderbenutte verhoog vir sy lede,  maar  ook  'n
verhoog van besondere status vir die uitvoerende gesag. Dit sou ook  beteken
dat  die  media  dan  gekonsentreerd  teenwoordig   kon   wees   met   beter
kontinuïteit en opvolging, wat hopelik tot  meer  indringende  verslaggewing
ter bevrediging van die  publiek  en  die  leiers  van  die  land  sal  lei.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Why are there as yet no closed-circuit  dedicated  radio  and  TV  channels
available to every school, community  centre,  everywhere  where  Government
services are offered? There people should be able to hear and  look  at  and
see what their Government, and  their  Parliament  and  its  committees  are
doing and saying. We are talking about an  enormous  number  of  people  who
could be reached in this way. Such a network must then  be  used,  and  then
one must of course also persuade the Cabinet and the head of  state  to  use
Parliament properly  and  to  make  their  announcements  here  rather  than
elsewhere. Make Parliament the institution it  should  be  and  kill  a  few
birds with one stone.

Then we would be more than an underutilised stage for members,  but  also  a
stage of special status for the executive authority. This  would  also  mean
that  the  media  could  be  present  in  a  concentrated  way  with  better
continuity and follow-up,  which  would  hopefully  lead  to  more  incisive
reporting to the satisfaction of the  public  and  of  the  leaders  of  the
country.]

The clash of interests between the BUA service, which functions  as  a  news
agency, and the independent media could  also  be  eliminated  and  a  great
saving of the taxpayer's money could ensue. I  am  talking  of  competition.
The approach in respect of the Presidential Press  Corps  still  needs  more
adjustment. It should be seen as a specialised group, not an exclusive  body
which may cause professional jealousy among colleagues and  which  functions
as an elite reporting group. The rest of the press should still have  access
to the head of state as a normal convention in a modern  democracy.  Foreign
journalists have accreditation and accommodation in the White House. I  hear
rumours  that  some  foreign  reporters  are  taking   out   South   African
citizenship  to  become  eligible  to  be  embedded  with   our   President.
[Interjections.]

Hier  by  ons  word  beoog  om  die  vrye  pers   selfs   sonder   voldoende
onderhandeling uit die hoofgebou van die Parlement  te  skuif.  Ek  vra  die
Minister om sy invloed in dié verband te gebruik en verder oor hierdie  saak
te besin. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die Nuwe NP steun die begroting.  Ons  wens  die
agb Nat alles wat mooi is toe, en sê baie dankie vir alles. Ons sien uit  na
die dag wanneer hy die portefeuljekomitee in sy  nuwe  hoedanigheid  besoek.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Here locally it is envisaged to move the free press from the main  building
of Parliament even without adequate negotiation. I ask the Minister  to  use
his influence in  this  regard  and  to  reflect  further  on  this  matter.
[Interjections.] The New NP supports the budget. We wish  the  hon  Nat  all
the best, and thank him very much for everything. We  look  forward  to  the
day when he will be visiting the portfolio committee in  his  new  capacity.
[Interjections.]]

Mr R D PIETERSE: Saam in die stryd  om  die  grense  van  armoede  terug  te
stoot. [Together in the struggle to push back the frontiers of poverty.]

Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister Essop Pahad and hon members,  that,  in
a nutshell, was at  the  heart  of  the  state  of  the  nation  address  as
delivered by my President on 14 February this year. He spoke about the  last
year  of  minority  domination,  and  the  finalisation   in   the   interim
Constitution. Also, it was the year we lost two  of  our  greatest  leaders,
Comrades O R Tambo and Chris Hani. He covered the ICC Cricket World Cup  and
offered assistance with regard to the problems of the United Nations.

Hy gaan voort en bedank die mense van Suid-Afrika  wat  hulle  moue  opgerol
het en steeds besig is om as vrywilligers hierdie mooi land van ons  nog  'n
beter plek vir almal te maak. Wanneer ons  vandag,  tien  jaar  later  terug
kyk, moet ons sê: Alhoewel alles nie perfek is nie,  is  ons  beter  daaraan
toe as in die verlede. Inderdaad het die gety gedraai.  Ja,  'n  beter  lewe
vind plaas elke dag. Hierdie boodskap moet aan al ons mense gaan, veral  ons
mense op die platteland, asook vir  ons  mense  wat  steeds  benadeel  word,
hetsy deur gestremdheid, taal,  kultuur,  kleur,  geslag  of  selfs  woning.
Hierdie mense het die geleentheid  gehad  om  hul  probleme  en  verwagtinge
direk   met   die   President   en   die   Adjunkpresident,   Ministers   en
Adjunkministers, Premiers en LUR'e te bespreek deur die imbizos by te  woon.
Hierdie praktyk moet seer sekerlik die engiste van  sy  soort  wees  in  die
wêreld. Ons moet die  Regering  daarvoor  prys.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[He went on to thank the people of South Africa who  have  rolled  up  their
sleeves and who  are  still,  as  volunteers,  busy  making  this  beautiful
country of ours an even better place for everyone. When we look back  today,
10 years down the line, we have to say: Although not everything is  perfect,
we are better off than we were in the past. Indeed,  the  tide  has  turned.
Yes, a better life is taking place every day. This message has to go to  all
our people, especially our people in the rural areas,  as  well  as  to  our
people who are still being  detrimentally  affected  by  either  disability,
language, culture, colour, sex or  even  residence.  These  people  had  the
opportunity directly to discuss their problems  and  expectations  with  the
President  and  the  Deputy  President,  Ministers  and  Deputy   Ministers,
premiers and MECs by attending the imbizos. This  practice  must  surely  be
the only one of its kind in the world. We have  to  commend  the  Government
for that.]

In November last year, we had a  two-day  public  hearing  regarding  racial
inequalities in the advertising industry.  These  inequalities  existed  not
only in the ownership, but also in the kind of advertisements  in  both  the
electronic  and  print  media.  We  experienced   that   real   or   genuine
transformation was inadequate.

This picture was ably illustrated  by  the  black  fronts  in  the  industry
and/or the black employees who are boxed in at the bottom  of  the  industry
ladder.

The advertising industry was structured and did things in such  a  way  that
it might be difficult or even impossible for them  to  transform  themselves
on their own or at the healthy pace that we do need.  We  need  to  look  at
suggestions or recommendations that came from the public hearings,  and  get
a task team with Government at the centre or make  direct  interventions  to
get the process  of  transformation  going  at  a  very  healthy  pace.  The
patience of our people is wearing extremely thin.

This industry, like all others, must play a role in addressing  the  poverty
amongst our people, mentally and physically.

Hoor  net  wat  sê  Yvonne  Johnston,  hoof-uitvoerende  amptenaar  van  die
Internasionale Bemarkingsraad van Suid-Afrika, of beter bekend as  die  IMC:
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Just listen to  what  Yvonne  Johnston,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the
International Marketing Council of South Africa, better known  as  the  IMC,
says:]


  South Africa is on the brink of greatness. We have to  stop  whining  and
  acknowledge how great we are and how far we have come in  the  last  nine
  years. We have allowed people to say negative  things  about  us  without
  countering them.


  It is important to present facts and put them into perspective. We are  a
  country alive, indeed, with possibilities.

I want to add that we are also a country that is proudly South African,  and
we have to buy locally produced goods.

Agb Minister, hierdie informasie moet op 'n gereëlde  basis  aan  ons  mense
deurgegee word.  Daarom  sê  ons  as  die  ANC-regering,  as  die  mense  se
Regering: Batho Pele. Die mense eerste. Ons moet  ook  daardeur  die  grense
van armoede terugstoot wat betref kennis van hulle regte en sake:  regte  as
werkers - plaaswerkers, huiswerkers; toelae vir kinders,  asook  gestremdes;
pensioene vir ons  senior  burgers,  ens.  Maar  net  so  belangrik  is  die
verantwoordelikheid van ons as burgers teenoor mekaar en ook so teenoor  ons
Regering. Ja, ons sê natuurlik:  Batho  Pele,  die  mense  eerste,  ``people
first''.
Ek wil graag dankie sê aan die beste voorsitter in die Parlement,  die  jong
en agb Kekana. Ek weet daar is mense wat dit wil debatteer.  Net  Kekana  is
nog steeds die beste voorsitter in die Parlement.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Hy  is
jonk. Hy is my broer, hy is my vriend, hy is my kameraad -  maar  bo  alles,
hy is my leier. Hierdie Parlement verloor 'n groot man, enig  in  sy  soort.
Nkenke, maak net seker wanneer jy na Telkom toe  gaan,  dat  Telkom  in  die
hande van die mense bly; dat Telkom die mense se Telkom bly.

Minister Pahad, dankie vir die leiding wat u  gee  in  hierdie  departement.
Ook aan Mnr Joel Netshitenzhe - baie dankie aan u  en  u  span  werkers  wat
wonderlike werk doen, vernaam teenoor die mense  op  die  platteland.  Dorpe
soos  Heidelberg,  Riversdal,   Albertinia,   Slangrivier,   Calitzdorp   en
Ladismith sê baie dankie. Ek wil ook dankie sê aan 'n spesiale span  werkers
van die GCIS en die parlementêre kantoor soos Collin, Petra, Donna,  Ludwig,
Zanele Siswane en Karen. Hulle doen wonderlike werk. Ek wil graag  ons  lede
uitnooi om die GCIS-kantoor oorkant die pad te gaan besoek  en  te  gebruik.
Al die pamflette met die mense se regte is daar om met die  mense  te  deel.
Dit is julle regte en wat julle kan verwag  van  die  Regering  en  van  die
werkgewers. Die ANC steun hierdie begrotingspos. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Hon Minister, this information should be put across  to  our  people  on  a
regular basis. That is why  we  as  the  ANC  Government,  as  the  people's
Government say: Batho Pele. People first. Through that we also have to  push
back the frontiers of poverty as  regards  knowledge  of  their  rights  and
issues: rights as  workers  -  farmworkers,  domestic  workers;  grants  for
children, as well as the disabled; pensions for our senior citizens, and  so
forth. But equally important is our responsibility as citizens towards  each
other as well as towards our Government. Yes, of course we say: Batho  Pele,
people first.

I would like to say thank you to the best  chairperson  in  Parliament,  the
young and hon Kekana. I know there are  people  who  would  like  to  debate
that.  Only  Kekana  is  still   the   best   chairperson   in   Parliament.
[Interjections.] He is young. He is my brother, he is my friend,  he  is  my
comrade - but, above all, he is my  leader.  This  Parliament  is  losing  a
great man, one of a kind. Nkenke, just make sure, when  you  go  to  Telkom,
that Telkom remains in the hands of the people; that Telkom will remain  the
people's Telkom.

Minister Pahad, thank you for your guidance in this depatment.  Also  to  Mr
Joel Netshitenzhe - thank you to you and your team of workers who are  doing
outstanding work, especially relating to people in the  rural  areas.  Towns
such as  Heidelberg,  Riversdal,  Albertinia,  Slangrivier,  Calitzdorp  and
Ladismith say thank you very much. I would also like to say thank you  to  a
special team of workers of the GCIS and the parliamentary  office,  such  as
Collin, Petra, Donna, Ludwig, Zanele  Siswane  and  Karen.  They  are  doing
exceptional work. I would like to invite our members to visit  and  use  the
GCIS office across the road.  All  the  pamphlets  containing  the  people's
rights are there to share with people. These are your rights  and  what  you
can expect from the Government and from employers.  The  ANC  supports  this
Budget Vote.]
The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: Thank you,  Chairperson.  First  of  all,  I
would like to thank all the speakers who have participated in the debate.

Let me start with Mr Gore. He is a victim of his own  delusions,  staggering
ignorance and a big lie. [Interjections.] I want  to  repeat  it  again  and
again and again so that it goes through your thick heads:  The  position  of
the Government is very clear, and we've said it over and over  again  -  our
policies are based on the premise that HIV causes Aids. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: On a point of order, Chairperson: Is it in order and is  it
parliamentary for the hon Minister to refer to hon members of Parliament  as
having ``thick heads''? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister,  I  think  it  would  be
unparliamentary. We need to underscore the point that all members  here  are
honourable members, and members with integrity. [Interjections.]
The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY: I withdraw that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you.

The MINISTER IN THE PRESIDENCY:  But,  that  he  is  a  victim  of  his  own
delusions and staggering ignorance, I stand by.

I want to repeat again that the entire policy of the Government is based  on
the premise that HIV causes Aids. I hope they understand that, once and  for
all. [Interjections.]

It would be useful if hon members come to this House, this very  respectable
House, and talk about reports that they themselves actually read. You  don't
read a report; you read a newspaper article about  a  report  and  you  then
come here and tell us what the report said or didn't say. Can I  advise  the
hon Mr Gore to go and read,  and  he  might  just  educate  himself  a  bit.
[Interjections.]

I also believe that it is an absolute disgrace that  the  only  contribution
the DA could make to this very important debate was to ask him to  say  what
he said. I really think it is a disgrace.

To Ms Vos, I am rather sorry that when the original thing  appeared  in  the
yearbook, nobody from the IFP brought it to our notice.  I  myself,  as  the
Minister, objected to the original formulation. Nobody  brought  it  to  our
notice, in spite of the fact that we said that this was open to  the  public
and that we wanted the public to comment on the yearbook. If you go  to  the
original, you will find that the formulations  are  even  more  painful  and
incorrect.

You've asked me to address this issue quite directly, and this is what I  am
going to do: There has never been and there never will be  an  intention  on
the part of the GCIS to cast any aspersions on or to vilify either  the  IFP
or Minister Buthelezi - none whatsoever.

In so far as the offending  sentence  is  concerned,  I  will  discuss  this
matter with the GCIS with the view to removing it from  the  yearbook.  That
will happen. [Interjections.]

You know, the DA wants to know ... [Interjections.] You want to  know  about
elections? When somebody says that elections are coming and  the  GCIS  must
only be a messenger and not interpret the message, it is reflective  of  the
old-type thinking: Amablackies, your job is only  to  be  a  messenger;  you
can't be anything else. You can't interpret, because you  can't  think.  You
shouldn't think for yourself.

Now, if you knew better, hon Mr Gore, in both the  elections  for  1994  and
1999, the GCIS made public undertakings, including to this House,  prior  to
the elections, that the GCIS would operate within a certain framework.  That
framework would be that the GCIS would not be, and I repeat,  would  not  be
the propaganda arm of any political party. [Interjections.] Let me  say,  as
the ANC now, that we do not need the GCIS to talk about us, because  we  are
good enough to speak about ourselves. [Applause.] When  the  elections  come
in the year 2004, it will be quite clear that some of you are not  going  to
be sitting here. You'd better go and look for other  jobs.  Thank  you  very
much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I need to make  an
announcement, and I hope you will listen carefully.  All  MPs  who  will  be
present at Parliament tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock will need to  gather  in
front of the Old Assembly Chamber so that the South African Revenue  Service
may  be  afforded  the  opportunity  of  a  photo  session  in  which   your
photographs will be taken and there are those who will assist  you  to  fill
in your tax forms. Members can do this at nine o'clock tomorrow.  Have  your
photographs taken and then you will be assisted in filling  in  your  forms,
so that you can be in good standing with the Receiver of Revenue.

The House adjourned at 18:48.

         COMMISSIONER FOR OCCUPATIONAL DISEASES (CCOD)


         I write to you in terms of section  65(2)  of  the  Public  Finance
         Management Act (PFMA), 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999).


         This Report was not tabled in time  as  the  new  Commissioner  was
         only appointed in November 2001, and he was therefore not yet in  a
         good position to gather  information  for  the  period  before  his
         appointment. Another major contributory  factor  to  the  delay  in
         tabling the Report is the fact that the Deputy Commissioner was  at
         the time still on suspension together with some of  the  officials,
         owing to financial irregularities identified.


         I trust that you will kindly accept  the  apology  and  accordingly
         grant us an opportunity to table this Report.


         Thank you in anticipation.


         DR M E TSHABALALA-MSIMANG MP
         Minister of Health


     (b)    Letter dated 15 May 2003 from the Minister of Social Development
         to the Speaker, tabled in terms of section 65(2)(a) of  the  Public
         Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1  of  1999),  explaining  the
         delay in the tabling of Annual Report and Financial  Statements  of
         the Disaster Relief Fund:


         Dr F N Ginwala


         REASONS FOR THE LATE SUBMISSION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF  THE
         DISASTER RELIEF FUND FOR THE 2001/02 FINANCIAL YEAR.


         AIM:


         (i)     To advise on the problems experienced with the  compilation
                  of the financial statements of the Disaster  Relief  Fund
                  for the 2001/02 financial year.


         (ii)    In accordance with section  65(2)  of  the  Public  Finance
                  Management Act, the  executive  authority  must  table  a
                  written explanation in the legislature  setting  out  the
                  reasons why the statements were not tabled in time.


         REASONS:


         (a)      The  Department  of  Social  Development  has  not  had  a
              permanent position responsible  for  the  compilation  of  the
              financial  statements.  Previously,   an   official   in   the
              Directorate: Financial Management was assigned to compile  the
              statements in addition to her normal workload.


         (b)     Due to an increase in  the  number  of  disasters  and  the
              extent of impact in  the  different  provinces  there  was  an
              increase in the number of applications. Contract  workers  had
              to be appointed to  assist  with  the  administration  of  the
              applications in the line function.


         (c)     The PASTEL software package, which was used to compile  the
              statements, could not handle all the  applications.  The  bank
              reconciliation   could   only   handle   4   999   outstanding
              transactions  and  the  applications  processed  per  disaster
              exceeded that amount by far.


         (d)     PASTEL version 6 was bought in March 2002, but the  problem
              was not resolved.


         (e)     The contract worker appointed in December  2001  to  assist
              with  the  compilation  of  the  funds  did   introduce   some
              improvements eg to import data captured on  the  mainframe  to
              the  software  package  EXCEL  but  left   the   actual   bank
              reconciliation's to be done by the interns.  The  interns  did
              not have the necessary skills and ended up re  performing  the
              bank reconciliation of June 2001 three times. This was done in
              February and March 2002. Please note that the June  2001  bank
              statements consisted of 144 pages.


         (f)     On 18 April 2002 the contract worker  resigned  because  he
              secured  an  offer  for   a   permanent   post   with   better
              remuneration. At that stage the interns  were  still  busy  to
              compile the bank reconciliation for June 2001.


         (g)     This affected the work being carried out  by  the  interns.
              Even though the  department  tried  to  continue  without  the
              contract worker but was unable to complete the work.


         (h)     At the beginning of July  2002,  the  Department  requested
              the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to  assist   with   the
              compilation of the statements.


         (i)     The work was commenced at the end  of  July  2002  and  the
              financial statements were submitted middle September 2002. Due
              to the volume of the work to be done, this  task  took  longer
              than was initially envisaged.


         Steps taken to address the situation:


         (a)     A permanent position at the level of Senior  Administration
              Officer was created on the establishment of the Department  of
              Social Development. This post was filled on 1 August 2002.


         (b)     The Sub Directorate responsible for the management  of  the
              Disaster Relief Funds has now  been  upgraded  to  Directorate
              level. This Directorate will also be responsible for preparing
              the financial  statements.  More  posts  are  expected  to  be
              created to deal with the financial administration of the  fund
              in the 2003/04 financial year.
