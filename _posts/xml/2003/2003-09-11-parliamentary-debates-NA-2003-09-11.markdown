                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) commemorates the tragic events of September 11, 2001,  when  hijacked
       aircraft plunged into the towers of the World  Trade  Centre  in  New
       York and shocked the whole world to a standstill;


  (2) notes that these acts of terrorism ended the lives of  citizens  from
       82 different countries, including South Africa;


  (3) pays tribute to all the innocent victims of these cowardly acts;


  (4) recommits itself to the Organisation of African Unity Convention  for
       the Prevention and  Combating  of  Terrorism  that  was  ratified  by
       Parliament in September 2002; and


  (5) expresses its agreement with the statement  made  by  the  honourable
       President, Mr Thabo Mbeki, at the United Nations that ``...  together
       we must take the firm position that no circumstances  whatsoever  can
       ever justify resorting to terrorism''.
Agreed to.

                     PRESENTATION OF CENSUS 2001 RESULTS

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker and hon  members,  as  a  country  we
have made remarkable progress in the few years of democracy. The  programmes
that we have put in place have, undoubtedly, been successful.

I am glad to announce to this House  today  that  Census  2001  has  been  a
success and that in their report to me the Statistics Council, a  body  that
has the statutory responsibility of oversight of the statistics system,  has
asked me to accept the results and promote their utilisation. I  am  pleased
to say to this House today: ``Here are the results. Please use them.''

You will remember about two years  ago,  when  I  addressed  this  House,  I
announced that the enumerators would soon be making  their  way  across  the
country, across the rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal, up the highlands in  the
Eastern Cape, through the flatlands of the Northern  Cape  and  through  the
security-tight suburbs of Sandton to count us in. Then,  this  House  agreed
that we needed a census.

Today I bring the results, albeit  slightly  late.  The  population  of  the
Republic stood at 44,8 million in October 2001, compared to 40,5 million  in
1996. Our population has grown by 10%  in  the  five-year  period  and  this
gives us an average growth rate of 2% per annum.

We can sketch with passion the census  undertaking  in  our  new  democracy.
Faced with the urgency to end minority rule that had dominated  our  country
for 350 years, we conducted  elections  in  1994.  Census  1996,  the  first
census in which all people were counted as equal citizens, told us how  many
people there were in our country at that  time.  Some  people,  particularly
those  living  in  former  Bantustans,  in  informal  settlements   and   on
commercial farms, had not been empirically counted since 1970.

After the 1996 undertaking we needed another census to confirm the  findings
of Census 1996 and to measure changes that had taken  place  over  the  time
period.  Legislation  that  we  introduced  in  1999  tells  us   that   the
Statistician-General has to call for the census to happen every five years.

South Africa needed Census 2001, and this is the second anchor by  which  we
can reflect on our first decade of democracy. Firstly, Census 2001 tells  us
how the national picture has changed from 1996 in terms of population  size,
distribution, density, age and gender.

We know that about 21% of our country's population lives  in  KwaZulu-Natal,
that isiZulu continues to be the most widely spoken  home  language  in  the
land, that between 1996 and 2001 the share of the Eastern Cape  and  Limpopo
as a proportion of the total population declined from  15,5%  to  14,3%  and
from 12,1% to 11,7% respectively, and that, conversely,  the  population  of
Gauteng witnessed the highest population  growth  with  1,5  million  people
added to the province over the five-year period. Indeed, the  population  of
Gauteng grew by 20%, whilst that of the Western Cape grew by 14%. For  these
two provinces the annual population growth rate  over  the  five  years  has
been 4% for Gauteng and 3% for the Western Cape.

The Northern Cape has had a population decline  of  about  18 000  over  the
same period. The other provinces have stabilised and have  growth  rates  of
close to 2%. We further know that the population of  males  is  21,4 million
as against 23,4 million females.  There  are  2 million  more  females  than
males, so they are no longer a minority.

Whilst the growth rate of  the  population  has  been  10%,  the  number  of
households has increased by 23%, with the average household  size  declining
from 4,2 to 3,8 persons in the  intercensal  period.  Households  living  in
formal housing have increased from 57,5% to 63,8% of all  households,  while
those  households  living  in  informal  housing  have  remained  relatively
unchanged at around 16% over the five years.

According to work conducted by Statistics SA on the  relative  concentration
of economic activity for 1996  and  2002,  approximately  400  centres  were
identified and ranked. The  results  show  that  Johannesburg  continued  to
dominate her economic space over this period. Cape Town has come in  at  93%
of the level of economic concentration in Jozi,  with  Durban  scoring  57%,
Pretoria 48%, followed by Port Elizabeth at 19% and Pinetown, Germiston  and
Bloemfontein coming in at around 10% each.

Only 70 of those identified economic spaces are at least  more  than  1%  of
what Johannesburg is, with six such centres ranking  at  10%  or  more.  The
remainder of the centres - 330 or so of them  -  contribute  less  than  1%,
with, for example, uMzumbe, Dududu, Moutse, Zwelitsha  and  a  place  called
Bochum-My Darling recording close to 0% in terms of  economic  concentration
in the ranking.

We also know from Census 2001 that there is a  relatively  large  percentage
of people who moved out of provinces such as the Eastern Cape  and  Limpopo,
to provinces like the Western Cape and Gauteng.

In the context of the census results in  this  study,  we  have  instruments
that enable us to understand the population growth rates  of  the  provinces
of Gauteng and the Western Cape, and  pose  questions  about  the  long-term
implications of this trend, not only for the receiving areas,  but  for  the
sending areas, as well.

Some of the questions that can be asked  in  relation  to  the  findings  of
Census 2001 are the following: What could be the main reason  for  the  high
population  growth  rates  in  these  two  provinces  where  the  growth  in
population numbers in specific terms has occurred  in  the  said  provinces?
What is the probable impact of  the  rapid  growth  in  some  provinces  and
declines in the others? How do these  changes  inform  policy  interventions
such as the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development  Programme,  the  Urban
Renewal Strategy and the Growth and Development Summit Accord?

This, of course, requires serious attention to issues  of  land;  access  to
land and agricultural production; sustainable rural  development,  including
subsistence farming and food security; accelerated economic  growth  through
local investment and foreign direct investment; skills development  and  job
creation.

Secondly, South Africa needs Census 2001 because it gives us an  opportunity
to measure progress made by our democratic Government in changing the  lives
of our people for the  better.  For  instance,  in  1996  there  were  63,5%
households in Limpopo that were using wood as the  main  energy  source  for
cooking, and that has declined to 59,5% in 2001.

As regards electricity for lighting, access to this facility increased  from
57,6% to 69,7% in the five-year period. The percentage  of  households  with
access to a telephone, be it a land line and/or a  cellular  one,  increased
from 28,8% in 1996 to 42,4% in 2001. Access to piped  water  now  stands  at
85%, and such access within 200 metres of a dwelling stands at 72%.

Thirdly, Census 2001 helps us identify those specific areas  of  development
where we need to focus with  regard  to  the  implementation  of  Government
programmes. We  know  that  the  percentage  of  households  without  toilet
facilities increased between the two censuses from 12,4% to 13,6%, and  that
the largest demand for this is in the Eastern Cape. The  increase  here  was
from 29,1% to 30,8%. Alternatively, 69,2% of the population still  does  not
have access. Clearly, we need a bigger intervention  in  respect  of  public
health so that we can  curb  the  spread  of  waterborne  diseases  such  as
cholera and other related diseases.

In the area of education, compared to Census 1996, Census  2001  informs  us
that the proportion of people without education has declined from  19,3%  to
17,9%, while the proportion with tertiary education has increased from  6,2%
to 8,4%. [Interjections.] Are you one of them?
Lastly, Census 2001 provides our citizens, including researchers,  those  in
Government and nongovernmental organisations  and  the  private  sector,  an
opportunity to engage in an  advanced  analysis  of  both  Census  1996  and
Census 2001. A detailed and thorough analysis will tell us much  more  about
the relationship between these variables  and  how  they  change  over  time
because we need to know this. We are a country that  has  a  great  appetite
for information. We cannot avoid detailed inspection of  our  most  valuable
tool for planning, namely our statistics.

The Census 2001 results come in a variety of  different  products,  both  in
printed and electronic form. Printed products include ``Census  in  Brief'',
``Key Findings'' and ``How the Count  was  Done''.  Amongst  the  electronic
products are primary tables, and national and provincial community  profiles
at the  level  of  cities,  local  authorities  and  suburbs  and  villages,
including wards.

We have also played a role in the census. In terms  of  SADC,  South  Africa
has been assigned the role of being the  co-ordinator  and  focal  point  of
census. In this regard, I am pleased to announce that Zambia  and  Mauritius
conducted their census in 2000; South Africa, Botswana and Namibia in  2001;
and, finally, Tanzania and Zimbabwe ran theirs last year. We  expect  Angola
and the DRC to run theirs before 2005,  while  Lesotho,  Malawi,  Mozambique
and Swaziland will conduct theirs in the second half of the  decade  as  per
their schedule.

In terms of legislation South  Africa  is  scheduled  to  conduct  the  next
census in 2006. That gives the SADC region and  the  founding  protocols  of
SADC  a  relatively  stable  source  of  information,  because  the   region
collaborated and adopted common approaches to the census,  including  common
questions. We have indeed empowered ourselves as a region.

In doing what the Statistics Council has asked me to do,  I  would  like  to
highlight some of the points that the council makes in  terms  of  the  Act.
Listen, I will give you something to read. I will give you a file  with  the
letter  from  the  Statistics  Council,  Mr  Mac   what?   Makhathini?   No?
[Laughter.]

The council recommends to the  Minister  that  he  support  the  release  of
Census 2001. The statement by the Council is in the pack, and I  would  like
members to read the statement. Like  any  other  developing  country,  South
Africa is searching for its position in the information age. As  we  do  so,
we need to deal with the issues of costs and benefits. Do we want  to  spend
R1 billion every five years collecting census data? What  are  the  benefits
of doing so? What are the risks of failing to do  so?  All  these  questions
need to be answered by us, and  I  think  Parliament  would  be  exceedingly
important in this regard.

Statistics SA is just implementing the mandate with which we have  entrusted
them by means of an Act of Parliament. The consultative process has  started
with regard to whether Census 2006 should  be  conducted  or  not,  and  the
Statistics Council will advise  the  Statistician-General  and  me  after  2
October this year. We are one of the few  countries  that  take  five-yearly
censuses in the world, and, in fact, we are the  only  one  on  the  African
continent.

Statistics SA has done it again. I know that they  normally  say  this  when
they take the blame, but this time they have done something  well.  I  would
like this House to join me in congratulating  the  Statistician-General,  Mr
Pali Lehohla, and the Statistics  SA  management  on  the  good  work  done.
[Applause.] I also want to extend my gratitude  to  the  Statistics  Council
whose chairperson, Dr Hilary Southall, is in the box here  today  and  whose
members have put in hours and hours of work to make Census 2001 a reality.

Finally, I would like to thank this House for  affording  Statistics  SA  an
opportunity to bring the census results to the National Assembly. Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, hon members, the  October  census
conducted in 2001 was  the  second  census  conducted  in  democratic  South
Africa.

The estimated figure is that we have a  total  population  of  44,8  million
people as against the  figure  of  40,6  million  in  1996.  The  Statistics
Council  in  a  presentation  to  Parliament  mentioned  that  there  is   a
possibility of an undercount. The post - enumeration  survey  revealed  that
as many as one in six people were missed in the census. It can be said  that
the broad estimate of the South African population is fairly accurate.  Some
figures regarding the composition of  the  population  by  gender,  age  and
population groups may not be representative of actual  figures.  The  labour
market statistics date back to October 2001  and  differ  considerably  from
those published in the September 2001  labour  force  survey,  in  that  the
labour force participation rates  are  lower,  unemployment  is  higher  and
employment levels are lower in the census. It is  extremely  important  that
the South African Statistics investigate these differences.

It is imperative that official South African  statistics  reflect  the  true
empirical picture at ground  level.  South  Africa  will  only  be  able  to
eradicate poverty and generate economic growth if a need analysis  is  based
on accurate representative data.

Sensus 2001 behoort van groot waarde vir alle instansies in die privaat-  en
openbare sektor  te  wees.  'n  Magdom  van  definisies  en  verduidelikings
rakende die demografie, landelike-stedelike  migrasie  en  ouderdomsprofiele
word verskaf. Die DA  reken  dat  'n  basisdokument  daargestel  is  wat  as
agtergrond kan dien vir die volgende sensus wat in 2006 opgeneem  sal  word.
Die rekenaarprogramme wat aan lede van  die  Parlement  deur  Statistics  SA
gegee  is,  behoort  van  waarde  te  wees   binne   hulle   konstitusionele
bedieningsgebiede. Op 'n ligter trant, die  agb  Minister  het  gepraat  van
``Boggem Darling''. Ek sal baie graag wil weet waar ``Boggem Darling'' is.

'n Ander aspek wat belangrik is, is  dat  daar  soos  in  die  res  van  die
ontwikkelende  wêreld  verstedeliking  in  Suid-Afrika  vanaf  landelike  na
stedelike gebiede plaasvind. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Census 2001 should be of great value to all  institutions  in  the  private
and public sectors. A host of definitions  and  explanations  regarding  the
demographics, rural  and  urban  migration,  as  well  as  age  profiles  is
provided. The DA is of the opinion that a basic document was  created  which
could serve as background for the next census which  will  be  conducted  in
2006. The computer programmes that were given to members  of  Parliament  by
Statistics SA should be of value within the constituencies that they  serve.
On a lighter note, the hon Minister spoke about ``Boggem Darling''. I  would
really like to know where ``Boggem Darling'' is.

Another aspect of importance is that urbanisation occurs  in  South  Africa,
as in the rest of the developing world, from rural to urban areas.]

Gauteng and the Western Cape are two provinces that  have  gained  residents
in this regard. South Africa is part of the SADC region and it is  important
that we give guidance regarding the  completion  of  census  methodology.  I
think that's the future of the whole southern development region.

The cost factor of R1 billion in future was mentioned by the  hon  Minister.
It is important that we investigate whether we can  afford  it  or  not.  My
considered opinion is  that  it  is  extremely  important  that  we  conduct
another survey. It can lead to a culture of statistics for  this  particular
country. Madam Speaker, I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, the IFP welcomes the census  results  for  2001
and we are fascinated  by  much  of  the  information.  I  think  it's  very
pleasing to see the  improvements  across  very  important  issues  such  as
water, electricity, telephones, etc. Like Dr  Rabie  before  me,  there  are
some issues we need to look at  a  little  more  closely,  the  unemployment
figures in particular.

I think  we  have  confidence  in  the  census  information  that  has  been
released, notwithstanding  some  anxieties  we've  had  over  recent  months
regarding the quality of the census. There  was  speculation  about  certain
methodologies. Some of these issues, I believe, came  up  yesterday  in  the
presentation by Stats SA, but the  adjustments  and  the  accommodations  of
those small problems seem to have been taken care of. We also  recall  after
the Stats SA inflation data problems, there  were  issues  of  capacity  and
expertise at Stats SA, but there again, I believe  the  Minister  has  taken
steps to remedy that. So, we do have  a  growing  confidence.  I  think  the
accumulated experience over the past two censuses is going  to  help  us  in
going forward with the next census.

Also, congratulations to Stats SA on the time they've taken  to  assimilate,
analyse and produce the data which was that much quicker than  the  previous
census. Then I'd also like to mention that I  think  the  new  products  and
information have been produced and packaged in a most useful form.  This  is
very helpful for Government policy-makers, especially across  social  policy
areas and the transformation thereof that I mentioned.
However, as  was  said  yesterday,  products  such  as  ``My  Constituency''
consist of a census digital atlas, the likes of which could be  very  useful
to us as members of Parliament. We should have an interest in these  issues.
Not only does it help us to oversee departments in  what  they  do  and  how
they're succeeding, but also in the  party-political  context  itself;  that
information can help us partake in  party  positions,  in  our  constituency
work and even in electioneering.

So let me join the Minister in congratulating Mr Lehohla  and  his  team  at
Stats SA, as well as the Stats Council for producing  this  information  for
us. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Agb Speaker, die geloofwaardigheid van  Statistiek  SA  het
in die jongste tyd 'n ernstige knou gekry. Die onprofessionele fout wat  tot
onlangs toe by die berekening van die  verbruikersprysindeks  gemaak  is  en
die slordige wyse waarop die departement  met  finansies  omgaan,  soos  wat
verlede week deur die Staande Komitee oor Openbare Rekenings aangehoor  moes
word, laat 'n mens wonder of daar  nie  ook  maar  net  slordig  met  syfers
omgegaan word  nie.  Geen  behoorlike  beplanning  kan  gedoen  word  sonder
behoorlike en betroubare statistiek nie.

Die inligting wat vrygestel is, toon nietemin  dat  Suid-Afrika  'n  tydperk
van positiewe ontwikkeling deurmaak wat deur enkele teenstrydige,  negatiewe
tendense, tipies aan 'n ontwikkelende ekonomie, vernietig  kan  word  indien
die probleem nie betyds effektief aangespreek word nie.  Dit  sluit  in  dat
welvaart wel geskep word, maar dat die  gaping  tussen  ryk  en  arm  steeds
kommerwekkend vergroot, dat nuwe werkgeleenthede teen 'n  volgehoue,  matige
tempo   geskep   word,   maar   dat   die   werkloosheidsyfer   onder   alle
bevolkingsgroepe steeds styg en reeds onrusbarende vlakke  bereik  het,  dat
die geletterdheidsvlak onder alle bevolkingsgroepe besig is  om  bevredigend
te  styg,  maar  dat  die  vaardigheidsvlakke  in   die   professionele   en
vakmansberoepe besig is om weens emigrasie teen 'n ontstellende tempo af  te
neem en dat hierdie tendens grootliks deur die staat onderskat word.

Die  Nuwe  NP  is  van  oordeel  dat  die  ontwikkelingsprobleme  wat   deur
Statistiek SA uitgewys is,  opgelos  kan  word  deur  die  positiewe  makro-
ekonomiese  klimaat  wat   tans   in   Suid-Afrika   heers   te   benut   om
verbeeldingryke werkskeppingsprogramme van stapel te stuur. Dit is  duidelik
dat  die  informele  en  kleinsakesektor  'n   veel   belangriker   rol   in
werkskepping te speel het as wat dit tans doen. Dit is ook duidelik  dat  'n
omvattende  vaardigheidsplan  van  stapel   gestuur   sal   moet   word   om
produktiwiteit te verbeter, maar veral om werklose mense gereed te maak  vir
suksesvolle  toetrede  tot  die  arbeidsmark.  Die  Nuwe  NP  verwelkom  die
vrystelling van hierdie belangrike naslaanwerk.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Speaker, the credibility of Statistics SA  suffered  a
serious blow recently. The unprofessional mistake which was  made  with  the
calculation of the consumer price  index  until  recently,  and  the  sloppy
manner in which the department deals with finances, as was heard  last  week
by the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, make  one  wonder  if  figures
are not also simply handled in a sloppy manner. No proper  planning  can  be
done without proper and reliable statistics.

Nevertheless the information that was released, shows that South  Africa  is
experiencing a phase of positive development that can be destroyed by a  few
contradictory, negative trends which are typical of  a  developing  economy,
if the problem is not addressed timeously  and  efficiently.  These  include
that prosperity is indeed created, but that the gap between  rich  and  poor
is still growing at an alarming rate, that new job opportunities  are  being
created at a sustainable, moderate pace,  but  that  the  unemployment  rate
among all population groups is still  increasing  and  has  already  reached
alarming levels, that the literacy levels among all  population  groups  are
increasing satisfactorily, but that the skills levels  in  the  professional
and vocational occupations are decreasing at  a  shocking  rate  because  of
emigration and that  this  trend  is  significantly  underestimated  by  the
state.

The New NP is of the opinion that the  development  problems  identified  by
Statistics SA can be solved by  using  the  positive  macroeconomic  climate
currently prevailing in South  Africa  to  launch  imaginative  job-creation
programmes. It is clear that the informal and small business  sector  should
play a far more important role in job creation than it is now.  It  is  also
clear that a comprehensive skills plan will have to be launched in order  to
improve productivity,  but  especially  to  prepare  unemployed  people  for
successful entry into the job market. The New NP  welcomes  the  publication
of this important reference work.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Speaker, die inligting versamel en verwerk uit Sensus 2001  het
baie  besliste  waardes  en  sal  bydra  tot  'n  sinvolle  en   doelgerigte
beplanning deur verskeie sektore van die gemeenskap. Van die  bevindings  is
teenstrydig   met   verwagte   uitkomste   en   tendense   in   vergelykbare
omstandighede. Dit impliseer nie dat dit noodwendig verkeerd  is  nie,  maar
dui aan dat dit met versigtigheid hanteer  moet  word  en  moontlik  verdere
navorsing benodig.

Die land vra ook dat die diepte van opname verdere uitgebrei word en vir  'n
opgeleide  span  werkers.  Die  vraag  is,  moet  die  volgende  sensus  oor
dieselfde diepte beskik of moet daar nie meer spesifiek net  gekyk  word  na
dit wat prioriteite is in terme  van  populasie  en  huishoudelike  tellings
nie? Dit kan moontlik ook meer akkurate inligting waarborg.

Die ACDP vereenselwig hulle met die sentimente wat  uitgespreek  is  teenoor
die departement vir die  goeie  taak  wat  hulle  gedoen  het,  en  net  ter
inligting, die mikroskywe waarop die inligting  aan  ons  beskikbaar  gestel
is, is tegnologies ver bo wat ons het. Ons het  nog  nie  sover  opgegradeer
nie, en gevolglik kan ons nie van daardie  elektroniese  hulpmiddel  gebruik
maak nie. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Speaker, the information gathered  and  processed  from  census
2001 has very conclusive values, and it will contribute  to  meaningful  and
goal-oriented planning by various sectors of  the  community.  Some  of  the
findings contradict the  expected  outcomes  and  tendencies  in  comparable
circumstances. This does  not  imply  that  it  is  necessarily  wrong,  but
indicates that it should be handled with caution and that  possible  further
research is needed.

The country asks for a trained team of workers, and that the  depth  of  the
survey must be expanded. The question is, must  the  next  census  have  the
same depth, or should one not be look at priorities in terms  of  population
and domestic counts? It can possibly guarantee more accurate information.

The ACDP identifies with the sentiments expressed to the  department  for  a
job well done, and  just  for  information,  the  microdiscs  on  which  the
information has been made available to us, are way ahead of what we have  in
terms of technology. We have not yet upgraded  and  consequently  we  cannot
make use of that electronic aid. I thank you.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  sensus  het  nie  sonder
probleme begin nie. Inteendeel, in die begin was daar nie  Afrikaanse  vorms
beskikbaar nie, en ek  moet  vir  die  agb  Minister  sê  hy  het  'n  goeie
voorbeeld ook vir ander Ministers gestel, want nadat  die  Vryheidsfront  se
prokureursbrief op sy lessenaar beland het,  was  die  Minister  onmiddellik
bereid om met ons 'n gesprek te voer. Ooreenkomstig die Grondwet het hy  dan
ook Afrikaanse vorms en ook  vorms  in  ander  tale  beskikbaar  gestel,  en
daarom sê die Vryheidsfront die agb Minister het 'n goeie  voorbeeld  gestel
vir ander ministers. Ons verwelkom dit.

Daar is  probleme,  maar  ek  dink  dat  die  statistiek  oor  die  algemeen
waardevolle inligting kan wees. Daar is baie  mense  wat  sê  hulle  is  nie
getel nie. Ek is een van die lede wat nie getel is nie, want niemand het  by
my uitgekom nie, maar nou sê die  agb  Minister  daar  is  'n  foto  van  my
geneem, so ek was dus twee keer getel,  want  my  huis  in  Stilfontein  is,
geneem, asook dié by Akasiapark. So, ek is óf twee keer getel, óf glad  nie.
Dankie, Mevrou die  Speaker.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Madam Speaker, the  census  did  not  start  without
problems. On the contrary, in the beginning there were  no  Afrikaans  forms
available, and I must say to the  hon  Minister  that  he  has  set  a  good
example to other Ministers,  because  after  the  letter  from  the  Freedom
Front's lawyer landed on his desk, the Minister was immediately prepared  to
hold a discussion with us, and in compliance with the Constitution, he  then
made  forms  available  in  Afrikaans  and  also  in  other  languages,  and
therefore the Freedom Front is saying that the hon Minister has set  a  good
example to other Ministers. So, we welcome this.

There are problems, but  I  think  that  the  statistics,  in  general,  can
provide valuable information. There are many  people  who  are  saying  that
they have not been counted. I am  one  of  the  members  who  has  not  been
counted, because nobody came to me, but now the hon  Minister  is  saying  a
photograph was taken of me, so I was counted  twice,  because  my  house  in
Stilfontein was photographed, as was the one in Acacia  Park.  I  have  thus
either been counted either twice or not at all. Thank  you,  Madam  Speaker.
[Interjections.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The Minority Front expresses  its
satisfaction with the Minister of Finance's involvement in Census  2001.  We
further express our satisfaction with the South African  Statistics  Council
on its involvement in Census 2001.

Our immense responsibility as Government is always noted in our  endeavours,
but it is statistics such as Census 2001 that  pronounce  the  size  of  our
responsibility and the reality of the South African situation.

The MF has no objection as to how the count was done, and judging  from  the
reports and the statement by the South African Statistics Council on  Census
2001,  the  method  certainly  boasts  constitutionality  in  the  light  of
transparency and independence  from  the  Government,  and  the  process  is
encouraging in the light of accuracy.

The MF  feels  encouraged  and  determined  to  deliver,  having  noted  the
statistics provided by the census. The MF feels that Census  2001  has  made
our strengths, weaknesses and existence a reality. It  is  hoped  that  this
shall invest greater determination in  delivering  a  better  South  Africa.
Hopefully the census to come and our promising Government would be  able  to
deliver statistics to a better South Africa. Thank you.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Speaker, ek wil my aansluit by die agb  Groenewald  in  sy
bedanking aan die Minister, maar ek wil darem vir hom sê  die  Minister  het
aan my persoonlik die versekering gegee dat die  Afrikaanse vorms  nog  lank
voor die dreigende hofaksie sal kom.

Spesiale dank vir die  elektroniese  skywe  wat  ons  ontvang  het  van  die
Minister. Ons verwelkom ook die offisiële bekendstelling van  hierdie  groot
projek. Betroubare statistiek is ononderhandelbaar  as  ons  regtig  al  die
vraagstukke van die land wil aanspreek en daarvoor beplan.

Die Minister vra 'n baie belangrike vraag in sy voorlegging aan ons  vandag.
Wat is die beste metode? Is dit nodig om elke  vyf  jaar  so  'n  omvattende
fisiese sensus te hou? Dis 'n  relevante  vraag.  In  die  elektroniese  eeu
waarin ons leef, is daar dalk sekerlik beter metodes as  die  fisiese  deur-
tot-deur sensus wat tot nou toe as die enigste  wyse  gesien  is.  Die  hele
risiko van ondertellings en al die drama wat met  'n  sensus  gepaard  gaan,
ook die uitdeling van kondome  wat  daarmee  gepaard  gegaan  het,  kan  dan
sommer ook vermy word. Ons sien uit na die  uitslag  van  hierdie  ondersoek
wat die Minister wil hou, om te kyk of ons dalk met alternatiewe metodes  in
hierdie tegnologiese eeu ook dieselfde resultate kan bereik.

Ons dank vir die sensus. Ons glo dat dit gebruik kan word tot  voordeel  van
almal  in  Suid-Afrika.  Baie  dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   speech
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Speaker, I want to join the  hon  Groenewald  in  thanking
the Minister. However, I want to tell him that the Minister  has  personally
given me the assurance that Afrikaans forms will be  available  long  before
the impending court action.

A special thanks  for  the  electronic  discs  that  we  received  from  the
Minister. We also welcome the official introduction  of  this  big  project.
Reliable statistics are non-negotiable if we  really  want  to  address  and
plan for all the issues of this country.

The Minister has asked an important question in his submission to us  today.
What is the best method? Is  it  necessary  to  have  such  a  comprehensive
physical census every five years?  That  is  a  relevant  question.  In  the
electronic age that we are living in there must  surely  be  better  methods
than the physical door-to-door census which has been seen as  the  only  way
up to now. The whole risk  of  not  counting  properly  and  all  the  drama
associated with  a  census,  also  the  handing  out  of  condoms  that  was
involved, can then also be avoided. We look forward to the  results  of  the
investigation  that  the  Minister  wants  to  have  to  see,  if  in   this
technological age  we  can't  achieve  the  same  results  with  alternative
methods.

We are grateful for the census. We believe it can be used to  the  advantage
of everyone in South Africa. Thank you.]

Ms S B NQODI: Madam Speaker and hon members  of  the  House,  let  me  first
acknowledge the fact that, as it happens, in all other countries, given  the
nature of all  official  statistics,  the  final  census  estimates  do  not
completely accurately reflect the true number of the people in a country  at
the end of the operation of the census.

I was impressed to note that this is the  view  also  shared  by  the  South
African Statistics Council. Recognising the importance of a census, this  is
not only a challenge to Statistics SA and Government, but also  a  challenge
to all of us who understand the reasons for  being  enumerated  on  a  five-
yearly basis.

The ANC members in this House welcome and  commend  Statistics  SA  for  the
exhaustive effort they put in in undertaking this cumbersome  operation  and
for providing us with  the  almost  100%  accurate  product  of  the  census
results which truly reflect the population estimates of all sectors  of  our
communities in this country. I am also  certain  that  all  members  of  our
portfolio committee were satisfied during our recent visits to  the  offices
of  Statistics  SA  in  Pretoria  with  their  adherence   to   professional
international standards regarding  data  collection,  processing,  analysis,
documentation and storage of data.

Given the magnitude of the intensity and the accurate counting process  that
you and your enumerators had to go through, we  are  really  proud  of  your
product - I am referring now to the Statistician-General.  I  also  wish  to
mention our appreciation for the work done  by  our  enumerators.  We  thank
them for the successful results and for sacrificing their leisure  time  and
risking all odds by participating in the head count of our population. As  a
committee we truly appreciate the fact that the limited human and  financial
resources,  together  with  the  skills  backlog,  had  to  a  large  extent
contributed to the delay in, the publication of these results by  Stats  SA.
We are equally mindful of their commitment to publishing correct,  accurate,
user-friendly and reliable data. We thank them for that.

Proper planning, informed by the true demographics of this country, is  what
the ANC-led Government strives  to  achieve.  Accurate  and  reliable  data,
which is informed by the findings of Census 2001,  is  a  useful  analytical
tool which policy-makers in  the  three  spheres  of  Government  need.  The
comprehensive statistical data provided by the results  of  Census  2001  is
surely a measurement of our population growth five  years  after  our  first
all-inclusive counting of our  people  in  1996  in  this  first  democratic
Government. Once again we are happy to be provided with  a  true  reflection
of empirical facts, and not just mere unscientific estimates  of  the  total
number of our population size as per municipality  area,  province,  gender,
age, ethnic and racial divide.
As the Minister alluded to, through these findings we can now  evaluate  and
assess progress made in realising the objectives of our government  policies
and programmes which, among other things, seek to  improve  the  quality  of
life of all  people  in  this  country,  to  bridge  and  narrow  the  gaps,
imbalances and inequities which we have inherited from the apartheid  regime
which, through its  deliberate  barbaric  policies  of  racial  segregation,
discounted a large number of our people who were driven out  of  the  highly
developed, civilised and industrialised towns and cities to the  dry,  poor,
unproductive and arid so-called Bantustans  in  the  land  of  their  birth.
Through these findings  we  are  able  to  correct  the  proportion  of  the
population size of the poor and the homeless who roam our  streets  and  who
are squashed into matchbox-size corrugated iron  shacks  in  squatter  areas
which proliferate on a daily basis on the periphery of the  comfortable  and
spacious dwellings of our former colonisers and oppressors.

Since 1996, for the very first time in  this  country,  a  true  picture  of
where and how the majority of black people are or live  has  been  given  to
the world. For the very first time, the poor and the jobless know that  they
are also counted in the statutory books of our country.

This definitely means a lot to them as it puts their  plight  and  suffering
right  at  the  doorstep  of  our  Government,  a  government   which   they
enthusiastically voted for and also put in place. In line  with  our  policy
objectives in  the  Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme,  government
planning  will  be  informed  by  a  true  reflection  of  gender  and   age
disaggregated data which show or tell us the population  size,  density  and
distribution of each  and  every  province  and  local  authority  in  South
Africa. This is necessary as it is an enabling economic and  budgeting  tool
for Government as a whole. It will help  us  as  Parliament  to  pass  well-
informed and targeted budgets in all three spheres of Government.

Hopefully this will help accelerate delivery, and bridge or narrow the  gaps
between our taxpayers by addressing the imbalances  that  continue  to  grow
between provinces, urban  and  rural  areas  and  racial  groupings  in  the
country. Surely this is what this Government aims for, and it is the  reason
why it is in place. These census results confirm  this  Government's  policy
priorities  which,  among  others,  seek  to  promote  an  integrated  rural
development  and  urban  renewal  strategy  which  will  help  improve   the
conditions and living standards  of  our  rural  and  township  communities,
thereby  alleviating  the  exodus  of  especially  the  economically  active
citizens and skilled young  male  entrepreneurs  from  the  rural  to  urban
areas.

The 20% population growth of Gauteng and the 14% growth of the Western  Cape
will surely sound morning warning bells for us as  policy-makers.  It  is  a
wake-up call for  the  policy-makers,  planners  and  implementers  in  this
province. We now know and understand why, almost every week, a new  squatter
camp is mushrooming  next  to  an  affluent  suburb  of  our  industrialised
provinces.

Hopefully through these results the question of the need for  the  promotion
of gender equality will also be better understood and appreciated,  even  by
the most stubborn male chauvinists who continue to suppress the majority  of
our electorate, namely women, in all aspects of life. The  results  tell  us
that there are two million more  females  than  there  are  males  in  South
Africa today. This emphasises and justifies the fact that women  empowerment
and emancipation, together with  rural  development  where  most  women  are
concentrated, is both a policy and moral obligation for this Government.  We
commend the  ANC-led  Government  for  acknowledging,  through  its  gender-
sensitive programmes and legislation, that much still needs to  be  done  in
addressing the cause of the poor rural women.

The challenge of skills development programmes and the  improvement  of  our
education system, in such a way that it responds to the needs  and  interest
of our youth,  cannot  be  underestimated,  given  the  fact  that  the  age
distribution reflects that we have a relatively  young  population  in  this
country and that, despite the importance of computer literacy in  the  world
today, only 2% of African-headed households have a computer, as compared  to
46% of white-headed households. Madam Chairperson,  we  commend  and  accept
the report presented to us. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Debate concluded.

                  SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr A N LUTHULI (ANC): Thank you, Madam  Speaker.  The  ANC  statement  reads
thus: This Thursday  marks  the  second  anniversary  of  the  September  11
attacks on the USA, where thousands of people died and others  were  injured
when aircrafts plunged into the Twin Towers buildings  at  the  World  Trade
Centre.

The African National Congress strongly condemns all forms of  terrorism.  We
condemn also all unilateral actions to solve global problems. We would  like
to reiterate our position that the  responsibility  of  the  United  Nations
with regard to issues of international peace and security and  the  peaceful
resolution of international conflicts must be  respected  by  all.  We  call
upon all nations and governments  to  respect  the  United  Nations  and  to
refrain  from  unilateral  action  in  the   fight   against   international
terrorism.

We urge all countries to contribute to the goal of creating a  better  world
by adhering to the principle and practice of multilateralism, and acting  at
all times in a manner that promotes global peace and  security.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

                          DA'S BY-ELECTION RESULTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J SELFE (DA): Madam Speaker, it is about time  that  Parliament  and  the
public were informed about the  interesting  by-election  results  over  the
past few weeks. [Interjections.]

The DA is winning increasing support and votes while the  ANC  is  suffering
significant setbacks. The New NP has all but ceased to  exist.  In  the  by-
elections in Kimberley, Stellenbosch,  Buffalo  City,  Pietermaritzburg  and
Nelspruit, the DA won convincingly by giving the ANC a  real  thrashing.  In
Cloetesville, the DA lost to the ANC by  only  four  votes  and,  in  Mohale
City, an ANC stronghold, the ANC dropped from 77% in 1999 to 68%, while  the
DA grew from 10% to 29%.

In all wards fought by the New NP, they lost hopelessly. They are no  longer
a political factor. Next year's election will be a fight between the DA  and
its allies on the one  hand,  and  the  ANC  on  the  other.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

                           LANGEBERG BY-ELECTIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr R D PIETERSE (ANC): Speaker, die African National  Congress  het  op  27
Augustus  2003  die  tussenverkiesing  in  Albertinia  in   die   Langeberg-
munisipaliteit met 'n oorweldigende meerderheid van 61% teenoor  die  powere
39% van die DA gewen. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Dit het gebeur, ten spyte van die feit dat die huidige burgemeester van  die
Langeberg-munisipaliteit, mnr Theuns Botha, die provinsiale  leier  van  die
DA is. Die provinsiale leier is ook bygestaan deur die agb  Tony  Leon,  Joe
Seremane en Kraai Van Niekerk. Die enigste persoon wat  nie  daar  was  nie,
was die Speaker. Al die DA se leiers was daar, en die  mense  het  hulle  so
gekyk en gesê: Vandag gaan ons hulle trap. En ons het  hulle  ook  op  hulle
nek getrap. Ons het hulle gewen met 61%. [Applous.]

Die ANC glo hierdie oorwinning illustreer dat die  mense  van  die  Wes-Kaap
moeg en fed-up is vir die DA se ``swart  gevaar'',  ``slaan  terug'',  ``die
Zimbabwiese veldtog'' en alles wat negatief is, en met  die  res  van  Suid-
Afrika wil saamwerk en verenig vir  'n  nie-rassige  en  demokratiese  Suid-
Afrika. Die ANC doen 'n beroep op alle Suid-Afrikaners om te veg teen rasse-
polarisasie, en om ter wille van eenheid en nie-rassigheid mekaar onder  die
vaandel van die ANC te omarm.

By the way, Speaker, die ANC het ook die  tussenverkiesing  in  Stellenbosch
gewen, wat 'n vesting was van die DA, so die ... (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mr R D PIETERSE (ANC): Speaker, on 27  August  2003  the  African  National
Congress won the by-election in Albertinia  in  the  Langeberg  Municipality
with an overwhelming majority of 61%, compared with the meagre  39%  of  the
DA. [Interjections.]

This happened in spite of the fact that the present mayor of  the  Langeberg
Municipality, Mr Theuns Botha, is the  provincial  leader  of  the  DA.  The
provincial leader was also assisted by the hon Tony Leon, Joe  Seremane  and
Kraai van Niekerk. The only person who was not there was  the  Speaker.  All
the leaders of the DA were there, and the  people  took  one  look  at  them
said: Today we are going to walk all over them. And we really did  walk  all
over them. We beat them with 61%. [Applause.]

The ANC believes that this  victory  illustrates  that  the  people  of  the
Western Cape are  tired,  fed-up  with  the  DA's  ``swart  gevaar''  [black
danger],  ``slaan  terug''  [fight  back],  the  Zimbabwean   campaign   and
everything that is negative, and that they want to co-operate with the  rest
of South Africa and unite for a nonracial and democratic South  Africa.  The
ANC appeals to all South Africans to fight against racial  polarisation  and
to embrace unity and nonracialism under the banner of the ANC.

By the way, Speaker, the ANC  also  won  the  by-election  in  Stellenbosch,
which used to be a bastion of the DA, so the ...]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, hon member.

the statement was incorrect. Thank you.] [Applause.]

                                DEATH PENALTY

                            (Member's Statement)
Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP): Madam Speaker, the sheer  brutality  with  which
murders are being committed in South Africa has now forced  the  New  NP  to
call for the re-opening of the debate on the death penalty in a  responsible
manner.

When a young girl gets gang-raped on the Cape  Flats  and  then  stabbed  14
times, we believe that the death penalty is the only suitable  sentence.  We
also believe that it will serve as a deterrent against  other  crimes  of  a
similar nature. Of course, the death penalty is not the only solution.

Scientific research regarding the causes of the violent nature of  crime  is
long overdue and, hopefully, the hon Minister of Safety  and  Security  will
take the initiative in this regard.

Speaker, intussen vind die Nuwe NP die DA  se  eierdans  oor  die  doodstraf
amusant. Toe  die  DA-leier  in  'n  onbewaakte  oomblik  verklaar  dat  die
doodstraf moet terugkom, word hy onmiddellik gerepudieer  deur  die  doyenne
van liberale denke in Suid-Afrika, Helen  Suzman.  Terselfdertyd  wonder  'n
politieke kommentator of die DA nie miskien sy liberale waardes verloor  het
nie. Die DA is dit aan die Suid-Afrikaanse kiesers verskuldig om presies  te
sê waar hulle staan met betrekking tot die herinstelling van die  doodstraf.
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Speaker, in the meantime the New NP finds the  egg-dance  of  the  DA  with
regard to the death penalty amusing. When the leader of the DA stated in  an
unguarded moment that  the  death  penalty  should  be  reinstated,  he  was
immediately repudiated by the doyenne of liberal thought  in  South  Africa,
Helen Suzman. At the same time a political commentator wondered whether  the
DA was not perhaps losing its liberal values. The DA owes it  to  the  South
African electorate to say  exactly  where  it  stands  with  regard  to  the
reinstatement of the death penalty. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

                    HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THE EASTERN CAPE

member's statement follows.)

[Adv Z L MADASA (ACDP): Madam Speaker, census results show  that  the  state
of health and hospitals in the  Eastern  Cape  is  in  total  collapse.  The
Minister of Finance alluded  to  that  today.  These  results  are  a  clear
indication of the extent of the problems that face  people  of  the  Eastern
Cape. They are hungry and unemployed, and  the  majority  of  them  live  in
rural areas.  There  is  mismanagement  throughout  the  health  sector  and
hospitals in that province.

The ACDP is calling on the government of the Eastern Cape  to  double  their
efforts and introduce  mechanisms  that  would  improve  the  conditions  of
hospitals there as  soon  as  possible  before  people  die  from  incurable
diseases. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                       MORAVIAN CHORISTERS IN ACCIDENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr D A A OLIFANT (ANC): Mevrou die  Speaker,  die  Morawiese  kerk  het  'n
besondere rol gespeel in  die  bevrydingstryd  in  ons  land.  Teen  hierdie
agtergrond was  dit  dan  ook  heel  gepas  dat  die  kerk  besluit  het  om
verhoudings oor die grense van ons land te  verbeter.  Die  afgelope  aantal
jare het dié kerk besluit om deur middel van  hul  basuinskoor  jaarliks  'n
koorfees te hou waaraan hulle en  ander  lande  in  Suider-Afrika  deelneem.
Hierdie jaar was Namibië die gasheer, en na 'n baie suksesvolle  naweek  van
'n hoogstaande koorfees het hulle baie opgewonde terug gekeer  huis  toe  om
die wonderlike ervaring met die plaaslike gemeentes  en  families  te  deel.
Ongelukkig het hulle nooit  die  huis  gehaal  nie.  Hulle  word  van  hulle
kosbare en talentvolle lewens beroof deur 'n tragiese  en  ontydige  ongeluk
wat Maandag, 8 September, net buite Nuwerus plaasgevind het.

Namens die ANC, en in die  besonder  die  Blouberg-Noordstreek,  wat  Mamre,
Pella, Atlantis en Witsand insluit, wil ons ons diepste meegevoel  uitspreek
teenoor die Morawiese kerk in die Wes-Kaap, die  gesinne  van  die  ontslape
Jacques en Randall Adonis, Gain Goodall van Mamre, Mark  Davids  van  Pella,
Albert en Jerome Engel van Steenberg, Jeffrey Joemat van Bellville  en  Rone
Morkel van Wynberg. Ons wens die families sterkte toe in hierdie donker  uur
van emosionele lyding. Ons wil net vir u sê: Moenie bekommerd wees nie.  Ons
liewe Jesus sal hierdie wonde van u genees, net soos Hy  soveel  andere  s'n
genees het.
Laastens word dit verwelkom dat daar hierdie week  'n  konferensie  deur  is
verkeersamptenare gehou is om te kyk hoe om die slagting  op  ons  paaie  te
verminder en te  verhoed.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's
statement follows.)

[Mr D A A OLIFANT (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  the  Moravian  Church  played  an
important role in the liberation  struggle  in  our  country.  Against  this
background it was also most fitting  that  the  church  decided  to  improve
relations across the borders of our country. During the past few years  this
church decided, by means of their own brass band, to hold  an  annual  choir
festival in which other countries in Southern Africa participate. This  year
Namibia was the host, and after a very successful weekend of an  outstanding
choir festival, they returned home very  excited,  to  share  the  wonderful
experience with the local congregations  and  families.  Unfortunately  they
never made it home. They were robbed of their precious  and  talented  lives
by a tragic and untimely accident  on  Monday,  8  September,  just  outside
Nuwerus.

On behalf of the ANC, and in particular the  Blouberg  North  region,  which
includes Mamre, Pella, Atlantis and Witsand, we would  like  to  convey  our
deepest sympathy to  the  Moravian  Church  in  the  Western  Cape,  to  the
families of the deceased Jacques and Randall Adonis, Gain Goodall of  Mamre,
Mark Davids of Pella, Albert and Jerome Engel of Steenberg,  Jeffrey  Joemat
of Bellville and Rone Morkel of Wynberg. We wish the  families  all  of  the
best in this dark hour of emotional suffering. We just  want  to  tell  you:
Don't worry. Our dear Jesus will heal these wounds  of  yours,  just  as  He
healed those of so many others.

Finally, it is welcomed that a conference  of  traffic  officials  was  held
this week to see how the carnage on our roads could be reduced and  avoided.
[Applause.]]

                      THE CASE OF NIGERIA'S AMINA LAWAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss S RAJBALLY (MF): Madam Speaker, in March 2002  Amina  Lawal,  a  Muslim
woman in Nigeria, was found guilty of adultery and of having a child out  of
wedlock. Under the so-called Sharia law of Nigeria, the  crime  of  adultery
carries the punishment of death by stoning. The court appeal by Amina  Lawal
has been postponed repeatedly and is  now  set  for  25  September  2003  in
Katsina state, Nigeria.

It is important to note that Nigeria is party to international human  rights
instruments  which  prohibit  punishment  and  torture,  such  as   the   UN
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or  Degrading  Treatment
or Punishment, also referred to as the convention against torture,  as  well
as the International Covenant on Civil  and  Political  Rights.  Nigeria  is
also  party  to  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All   Forms   of
Discrimination against Women.

Noting this and the matter of Amina Lawal, it is felt that the  sentence  of
stoning to death is a major contravention of the above  principles.  The  MF
calls on the House to appeal to the Nigerian authorities  to  guarantee  the
physical and psychological integrity of Amina Lawal and  her  family;  voice
our opposition to all  forms  of  torture,  cruel,  inhumane  and  degrading
treatment and punishment; call for a guarantee of  human  rights  for  women
and that international and national standards for human  rights  be  upheld;
call on the state of Nigeria to bring forward the father  of  Amina  Lawal's
child so that he could take responsibility for his actions and  marry  Amina
Lawal, and take full care of her and the child. [Applause.]

                          VALIDATION OF PROPERTIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C AUCAMP (NA): Mevrou die Speaker, die Nasionale Aksie vereenselwig  hom
heeltemal met die agb Boy Geldenhuys se siening oor die doodstraf.  Ons  sê:
Vang hulle en hang hulle!

Die Nasionale Aksie versoek die  Minister  van  Finansies  om  sy  diskresie
ingevolge  artikel  29(8)   van   bylaag   8   van   die   Wysigingswet   op
Inkomstebelasting te gebruik om  die  tydperk  waarbinne  eiendomswaardasies
vir doeleindes van kapitaalwinsbelasting op bestaande eiendomme aanvaar  kan
word, van twee tot drie jaar te verleng, by  wyse  van  afkondiging  in  die
Staatskoerant soos  vereis.  Die  tydperk  van  twee  jaar  verstryk  op  30
September. Indien die Minister gevolg gee aan die versoek van die  Nasionale
Aksie, sal dit aan die eienaars van  vaste  eiendom  nog  een  jaar  gee  om
waardasies te bekom.

Ons motiveer die versoek soos volg: Die praktyk  toon  dat  die  aanvanklike
twee jaar nie genoeg was nie en 'n baie lae  persentasie  van  eiendomme  is
tot op datum waardeer.  Daar  is  te  min  gekwalifiseerde  waardeerders  om
betyds in die aanvraag te voorsien. Dit lei daartoe  dat  mense  self  hulle
eiendomme waardeer, welke waardasies individueel deur SARS betwis kan  word.
Die proses van invordering kan sodoende vertraag word  en  kan  lei  tot  'n
verlies aan BTW.

Die  billikheidsbeginsel  kom  in  gedrang  indien  eienaars  weens  fisiese
omstandighede  nie  in  staat  was  om  aan  die  wet  te  voldoen  en   dan
noodgedwonge ongelyk behandel word. Dit sal ook  die  geleentheid  bied  vir
verdere bewusmakingsveldtogte deur SARS en die uitstel  van  die  afsnydatum
vir bestuurslisensies dien as 'n goeie analogie. Dit het orde  herstel.  Ons
verneem graag wat die  Minister  se  antwoord  hierop  is.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Madam Speaker,  the  National  Action  associates  itself
completely with the hon Boy Geldenhuys's  view  on  capital  punishment.  We
say: Catch them and hang them!

The National Action requests the Minister of Finance to use  his  discretion
in terms of section 29(8) of Schedule 8 of the Income Tax Amendment  Act  to
extend the period during which  property  valuations  for  the  purposes  of
capital gains tax on existing properties may be accepted from two  to  three
years by promulgation in the Gazette, as required. The period of  two  years
expires on 30 September. Should the Minister comply with the request of  the
National Action, it will give the owners  of  immovable  property  an  extra
year in which to obtain valuations.

We motivate the request as follows: Practice indicates that the initial  two
years were not enough, and a very low percentage  of  properties  have  been
valuated to date. There are too few qualified valuators to meet  the  demand
in time. This causes people to valuate their  properties  themselves,  which
valuations may be disputed by Sars individually. In this way the process  of
collection can be delayed and can lead to a loss in VAT.

The principle of fairness is prejudiced if owners were not  able  to  comply
with the Act owing to physical circumstances and  then  necessarily  receive
unequal treatment.  This  will  also  create  the  opportunity  for  further
awareness campaigns by SARS, and the  extension  of  the  cut-off  date  for
drivers' licences serves as a good analogy. This restored  order.  We  would
like to know what the Minister's answer is regarding this matter.]

                       RWANDAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss M N MAGAZI  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  on  25  August  2003  Rwanda  held
presidential elections where President Paul Kagame was elected and won  with
a 95% vote in his favour. The elections were conducted peacefully and  in  a
transparent manner, with many observer missions present. To name a few:  the
AU, the EU and the South African Parliament and Government  were  there.  As
South Africans we  witnessed  the  mobilisation,  voter  education  and  the
political will with which these elections were managed  with  the  resources
from the Rwandans, not from the international community. The ANC  urges  all
Rwandese people to unite, work and develop their country.  We  believe  that
the coming parliamentary elections will be peaceful as well. We applaud  the
Rwandan Government for the way in which it allocated resources and  time  on
the national television and radio to all parties. The  elections  were  free
and fair, and we wish Rwanda great success in  maintaining  peace  in  their
country and the Great Lakes. I thank you. [Applause.]

                               INTEREST RATES

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P J  RABIE  (DA):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  DA  neem  kennis  dat  die
Reserwebank 'n verlaging van een persentasiepunt in rentekoerse  aangekondig
het. Die nuus dat die VPIX inflasie binne die teiken van 3% en 6%  kan  val,
word verwelkom. Die DA  versoek  alle  kleinhandelaars  en  sakelui  om  die
besparings deur middel van die verlaging van een persent  op  die  repokoers
deur te wentel na die persone  wat  negatief  deur  die  rentekoersverlaging
geraak word, soos pensioentrekkers  en  individue  wat  van  'n  maandelikse
rente-inkomste afhanklik is, en wat nou minder geld sal  hê  om  te  bestee.
Die  rentekoersverlaging  behoort  besigheids-  en  verbruikersvertroue   te
verstewig. Dit is ook gebiedend noodsaaklik  dat  die  Regering  daadwerklik
die  volgende  drie  bedreigings  onmiddellik   aanspreek:   MIV/Vigs,   die
ongekende hoë werkloosheidsyfer en die  vloedgolf  van  misdaad.  Finansiële
markte  verkies  stabiliteit  en  roetine.  Die   rentekoersverlaging   word
verwelkom en die Reserwebank word versoek om 'n aanduiding  te  gee  of  die
verbruikers enige verdere rentekoersverlaging voor  die  einde  van  hierdie
jaar te  wagte  kan  wees.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's  statement
follows.)

[Dr P J RABIE (DA): Madam Speaker,  the  DA  notes  that  the  Reserve  Bank
announced a reduction in the interest rate  of  one  percentage  point.  The
news that the CPIX inflation could fall within the target of 3%  and  6%  is
welcomed. The DA requests that all retailers  and  business  people  channel
the savings generated by the one percent cut  in  the  repo  rate  to  those
people who will be negatively affected by the interest  rate  cut,  such  as
pensioners and individuals who are dependent on  a  monthly  interest-linked
income and who will now have less money to  spend.  The  interest  rate  cut
should strengthen the confidence of businesses and  consumers.  It  is  also
imperative that Government immediately and actively  address  the  following
three threats: HIV/Aids, the unparalleled high unemployment levels  and  the
tidal wave of crime. Financial markets prefer  stability  and  routine.  The
interest rate cut is welcomed and the Reserve Bank is requested to  give  an
indication whether consumers can  expect  any  further  interest  rate  cuts
before the end of this year.]

                   DEBATE ON HEALTH AND SCIENTIC RESEARCH

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Madam Speaker, noting the emergence of spring,  which
reminds us of reproduction, and the current  Parks  Conference  relating  to
biodiversity, which also relates to the reproduction  of  the  species,  and
noting the recent passing  of  the  National  Health  Bill,  which  controls
reproductive research through regulations over which  Parliament  will  have
no purview for it will be left  to  the  Minister  to  licence  reproductive
research and stem cell research in future, noting  also  the  immense  power
that is in the hands of researchers to change the world through the  use  of
biotechnology which can splice genes from one  species  to  another,  noting
genome research whereby we can understand the functioning of genes  and  all
living organisms, and noting cloning whereby species can be reproduced,  and
noting also the complex moral issues involved in research  using  fertilised
zygotes or embryos, this House calls on  the  Minister  of  Health  and  the
chairperson of the health committee to  hold  a  public  debate  and  public
hearings into the future regulation of stem cell research for  South  Africa
which has considerable potential to contribute to stem cell research  or  to
be exploited through stem cell research.  The  discussion  on  these  issues
should include scientists, doctors, ethicists, religious bodies and  members
of the public.

Thank you.

                        IMPLEMENTATION OF AGREEMENTS

                            (Member's Statement)
Ms P K MOTHOAGAE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the North West Department of  Housing
is improving the lives of the aged at the Lehurutse Township, Ward  12.  The
department has replaced corrugated tin houses that were built by the  former
Bophuthatswana government with proper houses for the  community.  The  ANC's
concerns are that the tin houses have not been dismantled and therefore  are
becoming a haven for criminals. These  criminals  use  the  tin  houses  for
their criminal activities - killing, raping  and  robbing  elders  of  their
money. The criminals are known in the community, but no  arrests  have  been
made to date. The community the SAPS, the Department of  Social  Development
and the municipality have held a meeting on these issues. The ANC urges  all
concerned to urgently implement agreements  reached  at  that  meeting.  The
existence of these tin  houses  should  not  be  allowed  to  undermine  the
magnificent work done by the ANC Government in delivering the houses to  our
people. ``There shall be houses for all''. I thank you.

                         RELIGIOUS POLICY IN SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mev M E OLCKERS (Nuwe NP):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  godsdiensbeleid  van
skole wat eergister deur prof Asmal bekendgestel is,  is  nie  volmaak  nie,
maar die Nuwe NP verwelkom die meer gematigde  standpunt  wat  die  Minister
uiteindelik ingeneem het. Die aanvanklike  konsepbeleid  sou  'n  einde  aan
alle godsdiensbeoefening tydens skoolure beteken het.

Die beleid wyk ook nie veel af van wat in elk geval tot  op  hede  in  skole
toegepas is nie. Skoolbeheerliggame word steeds toegelaat  om  die  aard  en
inhoud van godsdiensbeoefening te bepaal, mits dit binne  die  raamwerk  van
die  Grondwet  en  die  Suid-Afrikaanse   Skolewet   geskied.   Verder   mag
godsdiensbeoefening  deel  van  saalbyeenkomste  wees,  maar  leerders   mag
toegelaat word om  op  grond  van  gewetensbesware  van  godsdiensbeoefening
tydens saalbyeenkomste verskoon te word, mits billike reëlings  getref  word
vir die beoefening van ander godsdienste.

Die Nuwe NP het egter nog steeds 'n probleem  met  die  huidige  beleid  wat
voorstel dat 'n vergelykende  studie  tussen  godsdienste  van  graad  1  af
aangebied moet word. 'n Vergelykende studie behoort eers aangebied  te  word
wanneer die leerder se eie godsdiensoortuigings gevestig is.

Ons spreek dus die hoop uit dat die Minister hierdie  deel  van  die  beleid
sal hersien, aangesien dit kinders sal verwar as hulle  te  jonk  met  ander
godsdienste as hulle eie in aanraking kom.  Verder  moet  die  Minister  ook
toesien  dat  die  vergelykende  studie  deur  goed  onderlegde  onderwysers
aangebied word. Baie dankie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mrs M E OLCKERS (New NP): Madam Speaker, the religious policy  of  schools,
introduced the day before yesterday by Prof Asmal, is not perfect,  but  the
New NP welcomes the more moderate stance finally taken by the Minister.  The
initial draft policy would have meant  an  end  to  all  religious  practice
during school hours.

The policy does not deviate much from that which has until now been  applied
in schools. School governing bodies  are  still  allowed  to  determine  the
nature and content of religious practice, if it falls within  the  framework
of  the  Constitution  and  the  South  African  Schools  Act.  Furthermore,
religious practice may form part of  hall  assembly,  but  learners  may  be
allowed to be  excused  from  religious  practice  during  assembly  on  the
grounds of conscientious objection, provided  that  reasonable  arrangements
have been made for the practice of other religions.

However, the New NP still has a  problem  with  the  current  policy,  which
proposes that a comparative study of religions be presented from Grade 1.  A
comparative study should only be presented once the learner's own  religious
convictions have been established.

We therefore express the hope that the Minister will  review  this  part  of
the policy because it will confuse children if they come into  contact  with
religions other that their  own  at  too  young  an  age.  Furthermore,  the
Minister must also see to it that the  comparative  study  be  presented  by
well-equipped teachers. Thank you. [Interjections.]]

                        TAXATION POLICY - ENFORCEMENT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, there are two different issues  that
I would like to respond to. The first is that of the hon dominee  Aucamp  in
respect of CGT, and the second relates  to  comments  by  Dr  Rabie  on  the
Reserve Bank and interest rates. In respect to CGT, the  position  that  the
hon Aucamp takes is that these people who have had two years - 24  months  -
to fill out applications to have their properties valued and have  not  done
so, have not done so because there aren't enough valuers.

I would like to put forth an alternative interpretation. They have not  done
so because they are lax about their tax matters.  The  key  issue  is:  What
would enable us to enforce it? I feel no sympathy for  people  who  are  lax
about their tax matters. ``Render unto Caesar ... '' as the dominee used  to
preach. Now he says  no,  let  Caesar  wait  because  ``ons  is  'n  bietjie
slapgat'' [``we are a bit lax''.] It's wrong! It's wrong and I think  it  is
important that all members of this House should say it's  wrong.  We  should
agree that it is wrong and then we should look at  what  would  improve  the
enforcement.

Clearly it is a matter under consideration. However, let  us  not  hide  the
facts. The facts are that people are lax  about  their  tax  matters.  Thank
you.

                      INDEPENDENCE OF THE RESERVE BANK

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, the second issue is  the  following.
I think all kinds of issues, in the Bredasdorp  style,  were  smuggled  into
this statement by the hon Rabie, from HIV/Aids to crime. The key issue,  and
I think this is presumably what he was asking was for the  Reserve  Bank  to
show its hand, but it is silly in the extreme.

Monetary policy has to be managed by the  Monetary  Policy  Committee.  They
will take a view on the economy and take appropriate decisions in  time  and
circumstance. If you don't do that,  then  everybody  would  game  with  the
central bank and we wouldn't have monetary policy. You  would  have  profit-
taking and the impoverishment of the bulk of our people in this country.  We
would have our people in hock for eternity.

I think it is very  important  that  we  support  the  independence  of  the
Reserve Bank as per the Constitution, and the right of the  Monetary  Policy
Committee to take such decisions without fear or favour and  without  having
to give notice of what the decision would be. I  support  the  Reserve  Bank
and its independence. I thank you.

                      CONDEMNATION OF TERRORIST ATTACKS

                            (Minister's Response)
THE MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, the  SA  Government  was
amongst the very first Governments of the world that  conveyed  support  and
sympathy to the American nation in the  wake  of  the  11th  of  September's
terrorist attacks.  We  continue  to  indicate  our  solidarity  with  those
people, particularly those who continue to live with  the  trauma  of  those
events. Of course,  it  is  not  the  first  time  that  we  have  condemned
terrorist attacks against people.

Exactly 30 years ago, to the day, on 11 September  1973,  the  ANC  and  its
allies  condemned  the  terrorist  assassination  of  Allende,   the   first
socialist and democratically elected president  of  Chile.  That  particular
incident was, of  course,  abetted  and  assisted  by  some  of  the  modern
democracies of the world. Yet even at that point, we understood it for  what
it was -  a  terrorist  attack  on  the  people  of  Chile  themselves,  who
afterwards fell under the jackboot of Pinochet and for many  years  suffered
horrendous human rights violations.

                             CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: The other matter I want to refer to  is
the issue of the death penalty. We are happy as the  SA  Government  and  as
the ANC that South Africans, by and large, are people who are not  vengeful.
Because we are that kind of people, after  1994,  when  democracy  came,  we
never saw scenes of people who were chasing one another to  wreak  vengeance
against them because of the practices of the past.  Because  we  moved  from
that position, we  do  not  believe  any  state  must  be  one  that  visits
vengeance on anyone, including criminals. There ought to be  other  ways  in
which we can deal with those who are  criminals,  without  invoking  capital
punishment.

I have shared platforms with some people across there,  who  themselves  are
now talking about the return of capital  punishment.  They  are  doing  this
because they believe that this is an issue that  is  emotional  to  a  point
where they can derive support, using emotion as a vehicle for  mobilisation.
That is not what moves us from where we stand. What moves  us  are  policies
that are steeped in morality, and policies that have a regard for  the  fact
that we can never violate human life. Thank you. [Applause.]

                            RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I  am  not  in  a  combative  mood
today, so I am going to reply in a very sober, deliberate  way  to  the  hon
Olckers, because of the general  approval  of  the  Government's  policy  on
religion in education. I am grateful for the support, because we  must  move
away from the rather silly debates that have been taking place in  the  past
six months. I am grateful to all the political parties  who  have  responded
in a positive way.

This  policy  does  deviate  from  the  past;  let's  be  quite  clear.  The
fundamental assumption  of  this  policy  is  that  we're  a  multireligious
country. We must take that into account.  No  child  should  feel  isolated,
left out or prejudiced by any practice that takes place  in  school.  So  we
recognise the extraordinary unity between the state, which is not a  secular
state like France or the  United  States,  and  also  our  preamble  to  the
Constitution that invokes the deity and our  wonderful  anthem  that  begins
with a reference to the deity.

One must take into account that not only are we  a  multireligious  society,
we are a multicultural society also. That is why the discussions  that  took
place with all the churches were extraordinarily meaningful, because in  the
end we got an agreement that, first of all, we learn about the religions  of
the world, as reflected  in  South  Africa,  in  the  curriculum  itself  on
religion education.

Secondly, religious instruction is a function of the school and the  family,
and generally those associated with confessional education. That  will  take
place in school after school hours without discrimination. So,  the  largest
church in South Africa,  the  Zion  Church,  which  has  been  discriminated
against for years and years, will find a proper place in  the  school  after
school hours.

Finally, on  religious  observances,  there  are  constitutional  provisions
about religious observances in school.  We  say  that  there  are  different
kinds, but assembly is only one kind, and therefore we respond to  the  need
by saying that different religions should be  able  to  observe  their  holy
days. If schools organise other activities, then we must take  into  account
that we have a multireligious society. Can I  say  that  I  am  prepared  to
speak to all the parties.

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: I understand there was  a  joint  caucus  meeting
with two parties there. I'll speak to the New NP.

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister.  Hon  members,  that  ends  the  time  for
ministerial responses.
Order! Order, hon members. I have been requested to provide  an  opportunity
for a further motion without notice. In view of the  special  circumstances,
I will now give that opportunity to the hon Chief Whip of the ANC.

                      DEATH OF SWEDISH FOREIGN MINISTER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker,  thank  you  very  much
for that. I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with profound shock and sadness the passing away  this  morning
       of Anna Lindh, the Foreign Minister of Sweden, as a result of a fatal
       stabbing attack;


  (2) recognises the role played by Minister Lindh in fostering  solidarity
       and co-operation between Sweden and South Africa; and
  (3) expresses its condolences to the people of Sweden and the family  and
       loved ones of Minister Lindh.

The SPEAKER: I take it there are no objections. The motion is  carried,  and
we will convey the sentiments expressed to the government and the people  of
Sweden.

Agreed to.

             LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL FINANCE MANAGEMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF  FINANCE:  Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  the  Ministry  of
Finance is not given to hyperbole or sensation. As  in  the  debate  of  the
Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill  in  the  NA,  today  is
indeed an occasion to bring to fruition what has been a record or damn  near
a record in this Parliament. It has taken the greater part  of  three  years
to draft, redraft and refine it and, in fact,  I  have  lost  count  of  the
numerous versions to the Bill as circulated.

If my calculations  are  correct,  there  were  41  committee  hearings  and
sittings on this Bill in Parliament, in addition to smaller  working  groups
that also met. After all of that, I am given 10  minutes  to  introduce  it.
There should be  no  suggestion  that  this  legislation  is  not  the  most
extensively consulted upon piece of legislation before this House ever.

The Bill covers for the local sphere of Government the same issues that  the
Public Finance Management Act covers for national  and  provincial  spheres.
Indeed, this Bill was originally planned to be part of  the  Public  Finance
Management Act when it  was  first  prepared  for  tabling,  as  a  Treasury
Control Bill in 1998. However, at the time the specific  characteristics  of
local government were so different  from  national  and  provincial  spheres
that it warranted a separate Bill, hence it was removed  from  the  Treasury
Control Bill shortly before its gazetting on 14  August  1998  and  tabling.
The Public Finance Management Act was enacted as Act 1  of  1999,  within  6
months of its gazetting.

The  Bill  also  involves  two  significant  rounds  of  amendments  to  the
Constitution. The  first,  passed  in  2001,  amended  section  230  of  the
Constitution, which deals with municipal  borrowing.  The  second  amendment
was effected  early  this  year  to  section  139  of  the  Constitution  on
provincial intervention in municipalities, by  allowing  for  a  process  of
mandatory intervention in the event of  a  serious  financial  crisis  in  a
municipality where the ability to provide basic services is impaired.

Both  these  amendments  were  necessary,  not  only  to  resolve  municipal
financial crises, but also to protect municipalities and to reduce the  risk
premium for municipalities when they borrow funds. These amendments  protect
municipalities whilst they are resolving their problems, to enable  them  to
continue providing services. They also  provide  certainty  to  lenders  and
investors about action that can be taken against a  municipality  that  does
not meet its financial obligations. In this respect,  provincial  government
will have to rise to the challenge of assisting or intervening earlier  when
municipalities experience financial problems, rather than ignoring it.

Compliance by provincial governments to monitor municipal  finances  and  to
act when problems are first identified, is critical for good  governance  in
South Africa, and to  assure  our  people  that  basic  services  are  being
provided. Perhaps more importantly, it is to ensure  that  local  government
is empowered to deliver on its  constitutional  developmental  mandate.  The
current system of budgeting and financial management at the municipal  level
is antiquated  and  based  on  one-year  line  item  budgeting.  Unlike  the
national and provincial spheres, budgetary reforms, such as the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework,  budgeting  by  programmes  and  votes,  rather  than
inputs, focusing on outputs  and  performance  and  so  on,  have  not  been
implemented at local level, save for a few pilot municipalities.

The Bill before  this  House  will  introduce  these  budgetary  reforms  to
municipalities  over  the  next  few  years.  As  for  the  Public   Finance
Management Act, the approach to financial management  gives  effect  to  the
principle  of  ensuring  effective  accountability  for   the   policy   and
implementation processes. The mayor  will  be  responsible  for  policy  and
outcomes,  and  the  municipal   manager   responsible   for   outputs   and
implementation. Whilst the municipal manager is accountable to the mayor  or
executive, both are also accountable to the municipal  council,  which  must
approve the policy proposals and budget, and play an oversight role  in  the
implementation and the outputs.

This Bill spells out clearly the roles  of  councillors,  mayors,  municipal
managers and other officials in their engagement with the  municipal  budget
and  its  implementation,  procurement  or  supply  chain   management   and
municipal entities. It spells out the policy-guiding  role  that  the  mayor
plays in the budget process, with the IDP and other  policy  areas,  and  in
setting  performance  targets  for  the  municipal  manager.  It  makes  the
municipal manager the accounting officer responsible for  implementation  of
policies  approved  by  the  council  in  accordance  with  the  performance
contract agreed to with the mayor.

It also introduces quite firmly, the idea of the  annual  report.  The  Bill
imposes tough sanctions against a municipal  manager  or  municipality  that
fails to submit its financial statements within two years after the  end  of
the financial year.  This  measure  is  in  line  with  the  Public  Finance
Management  Act  and  deals  with  the  legacy  of  lethargy  in  submitting
financial statements promptly after the end of the financial year.  Just  as
this is no longer tolerated for  national  and  provincial  departments,  it
will not be tolerated for municipalities.  Similarly,  also  the  fact  that
some municipalities  choose  not  to  pay  the  Auditor-General,  cannot  be
tolerated in this environment.

The annual report will include reports  on  performance  to  be  audited  in
terms of the systems Act. Amendments to this Act are  coming  up  hereafter.
Annual reports will also include details of  all  intergovernmental  grants,
ensuring that these are all budgeted for by the municipality  and  spent  in
accordance with the approved budget. The Bill  also  obliges  municipalities
to disclose the salaries  and  remuneration  of  the  mayor,  the  municipal
manager, the councillors and the senior  officials.  I  thought  that  would
mean applause. [Applause.] Thank you belatedly. Thank  you  very  much.  The
annual report is an important tool for empowering both councillors  and  the
local community to hold the municipal officials and  the  mayor  accountable
for their performance in the delivery of services.

The Bill ends the practice of undisclosed or unaudited banking  accounts  or
investments by municipalities. It requires each municipality  to  open  bank
accounts into which all money received must be paid. The  municipal  manager
is  made  responsible  for  how  these  accounts  are   managed.   Municipal
investments will be completely transparent, and must be in  accordance  with
the investment framework prescribed by the National Treasury. The Bill  also
provides strong measures for dealing with financial  misconduct  or  grossly
negligent behaviour.
Most importantly, the Bill is forward looking. It requires  a  new  approach
to implement the radical changes that must replace the  old  practices.  New
skills are required to implement the Bill successfully, and a new  cadre  of
municipal and financial managers  and  practitioners  will  be  required  in
municipalities. In implementing  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Act, it is more important to implement the  spirit  of  this  Act
than to do so merely for the sake of nominal compliance.

The challenges facing us in implementing this Bill are enormous, given  that
there are 284 municipalities.  We  have  already  started  implementing  the
Local Government: Municipal Finance Management  Act  reforms  by  commencing
with a few pilots over the past three years. The  pilots  now  encompass  39
municipalities across the country that  are  rolling  out  sections  of  the
reforms with the assistance of the National Treasury and  the  international
technical assistance programme. Visible signs of progress  have  been  noted
in 24 municipalities which have already tabled multiyear 2003 budgets.

In conclusion, this Bill  is  one  of  the  foundation  Acts  of  Parliament
required by the Constitution and the 1998 White Paper on  Local  Government.
It gives effect to chapters 3 and 13 of the Constitution, and  section  139,
as amended. In  conclusion,  I  want  to  thank  a  number  of  persons  who
contributed to the Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill.
Firstly I want to thank the members  of  the  two  Portfolio  Committees  on
Finance and Local Government, for working so  closely  to  ensure  that  the
Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill  and  Local  Government:
Municipal Systems Act are consistent and linked to each other in a way  that
will help local government officials and councillors. I  want  to  thank  Ms
Barbara Hogan and Mr Yunus  Carrim,  if  he  is  in  the  House,  for  their
guidance during the processing of the two Bills. [Applause.]

I also  want  to  thank  my  colleague  Minister  Sydney  Mufamadi  and  his
officials for working so closely with National Treasury to ensure  that  the
two Bills are consistent, and for their  assistance  during  the  very  hard
process to amend  the  Constitution,  particularly  section  139.  This  co-
operation will be even more important in the coming years  as  we  implement
both the Systems Act and this one. I also want to thank Mr Johnny de  Lange,
the Portfolio Committee on Justice and officials for  all  their  assistance
in processing the two constitutional Acts required for this Bill.

Salga has been important for its participation in the process,  particularly
the valuable inputs from the mayors of Tshwane,  Ekurhuleni  and  Matjhabeng
and all the  individual  inputs.  I  would  like  to  end  by  thanking  the
officials of the National Treasury for all their hard  work  in  persistence
of this Bill and to ensure that the two Constitutional  amendments  in  this
Bill have finally been completed. Now they  face  an  even  harder  task  of
implementing the Bill successfully. Thank you very  much  for  listening  to
me. [Applause.]

Dr P J RABIE: Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, agb Minister en  agb  lede,  hierdie
wetsontwerp  is  van  kritieke  belang  vir  Suid-Afrika  as  daar  na   die
kommerwekkende skuldposisie van 'n aantal plaaslike owerhede  oor  die  hele
Suid-Afrika gekyk word. Die vraag is, het  dit  nie  nodig  geword  dat  ons
proaktief optree en die kapasiteit op grondvlak by  derdevlak-owerhede  skep
nie? Suid-Afrika is onlosmaaklik gekoppel aan 'n proses van  verstedeliking.
Die Grondwet bepaal dat elke  Suid-Afrikaner  toegang  tot  voldoende  skoon
drinkwater en ander maatskaplike basiese dienste moet hê.

Ekonomiese  groei  en  werkskepping  is  gekoppel  aan  ordelike   plaaslike
bestuur. Rekenkundige praktyke in sommige  plaaslike  owerhede  het  in  die
verlede nie aan aanvaarbare rekenkundige  standaarde  voldoen  nie.  Die  DA
steun die wetsontwerp, maar doen 'n ernstige beroep  op  die  Tesourie,  die
Departement  van  Provinsiale  en   Plaaslike   Regering,   die   onderskeie
provinsiale departemente en plaaslike  owerhede  om  toe  te  sien  dat  dié
wetsontwerp behoorlik geïmplementeer word. Dit is maklik om  wette  daar  te
stel. Om egter die kapasiteit te skep en werklik die lewensgehalte  van  die
persone op grondvlak te  verbeter,  is  'n  heel  komplekse  aangeleentheid.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P J RABIE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon  Minister  and  hon  Members,  this
Bill is of critical importance for South Africa if we have to  look  at  the
alarming debt position of a number of local authorities over  the  whole  of
South  Africa.  The  question  is,  has  it  not  become  necessary  to  act
proactively and establish capacity at  grass-roots  level  among  third-tier
authorities?  South  Africa  is  inextricably  linked  to   a   process   of
urbanisation. The Constitution stipulates  that  every  South  African  must
have access to clean drinking water and other basic social services.

Economic growth and job creation are linked to orderly local government.  In
the past accounting practices in some local authorities did not comply  with
acceptable accounting standards. The DA supports the Bill,  but  would  like
to make an urgent appeal to the Treasury, the Department of  Provincial  and
Local Government, the various provincial departments and  local  governments
to see to it that this Bill is properly implemented. It is easy to put  laws
in place. However, to establish capacity and to really improve  the  quality
of life of the people at grass-roots level is a complex issue.]

The  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill   relates   to
financial management in the local sphere of government. It gives  effect  to
sections 215, 216, 217, 218 and 229 of the  Constitution,  which  deal  with
the transparency of budgets, budget formats, Treasury norms  and  standards,
procurement guarantees and municipal fiscal powers, which  include  taxation
and borrowing. The Bill was debated and amended for more than  18  months  -
the final draft was only completed in the first week of September.

Another significant aspect of this piece of legislation  is  that  it  deals
with section 139 of the Constitution, as amended in 2003 by Act  2003  which
deals with provincial and national intervention over local government  if  a
municipality fails to pass a budget strictly in terms of section  139(1)  of
the Constitution or fails to provide basic services,  fails  to  meet  basic
commitments,  etc.  Discretionary  provincial  and  national  interventions,
however, must  follow  set  procedures  in  terms  of  section  139  of  the
Constitution.

The MFM Bill can be compared with the Public  Finance  Management  Act,  the
PFMA, which covers  the  national  and  provincial  spheres  of  government.
Because of the complexities of local government, it was decided to create  a
Bill which would provide  uniform  Treasury  norms  and  standards  for  all
spheres of government.  This  Bill  gives  effect  to  section  216  of  the
Constitution which stipulates that national  legislation  must  establish  a
National Treasury and prescribe measures to  ensure  both  transparency  and
expenditure control in each sphere of government, and  subparagraph  (c)  of
this section stipulates uniform Treasury norms and  standards,  which  is  a
very important aspect of this particular Bill.
This Bill provides extensively for  the  effective  accountability  for  the
policy and  implementation  process.  The  distinction  that  the  mayor  is
responsible  for  policy  and  outcomes,  and  the  municipal   manager   is
responsible for outputs and implementation is also very important.

The Bill is extremely detailed and covers 16  chapters.  The  first  chapter
defines key terms and determines the conditions under  which  amendments  to
legislation may be made.  Chapter  2  deals  with  the  powers  of  National
Treasury regarding local government, finance and fiscal powers.

Chapter 3 is one of the core chapters of the Bill  because  it  sets  out  a
framework for municipal banking accounts into which all  money  received  by
municipalities  must  be  paid.  It  also  requires  each  municipality   to
designate one primary  banking  account  into  which  all  intergovernmental
grants must be deposited. The municipal  manager  is  made  accountable  for
these accounts  and  must  ensure  compliance  with  various  oversight  and
administrative requirements. A framework for municipal cash  management  and
management of investment by municipalities  is  also  stipulated.  During  a
submission to  the  Finance  committee  it  was  mentioned  that  a  certain
municipality invested millions of rands into holiday flats at  a  beachfront
in a well-known South African city.

During a number of meetings of the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance  in  the
past 18 months, a number of case studies  were  presented;  Koppies  in  the
North West province and Butterworth  in  the  Eastern  Cape  were  cited  as
examples where draconian intervention measures had to be taken by  provinces
in terms of section 139 of the Constitution which  provides  for  provincial
supervision of local government.

Chapter 4  deals  with  the  integrated  development  plans,  municipal  tax
tariffs and credit control policies. Councils are also made responsible  for
approving budgets within the specific legal framework stipulated. Chapter  5
provides for organs of state providing bulk resources, such  as  electricity
and water to municipalities, to consult municipalities  when  municipalities
intend to sign long-term contracts.

Chapter 6  deals  with  the  borrowing  of  money.  Chapter  7  defines  the
responsibilities of councillors, the mayor, executive mayor or  council.  It
prohibits  the  councillor  for  financial  matters  from   interfering   in
financial management responsibilities assigned to the municipal  manager  or
chief financial officer.

As a former councillor, the definition  of  the  responsible  overseeing  of
expenditures and revenue collection, preventing  overspending  of  a  budget
rate, is very significant to me, and will  act  as  a  guideline  to  future
councillors.

Chapter 8 defines the  responsibilities  of  officials.  Written  employment
contracts  and  performance  standards  are  required,  and  efficient   and
transparent systems of financial and risk management are clearly spelt out.

A treasury and budget  office  must  also  be  established  by  every  local
authority. Municipal entities were  discussed  at  length  by  parliamentary
committees. The accounting  requirements,  auditing  asset  transfers,  debt
management, financial reporting and  the  accounting  authority  accountable
for the execution functions were also discussed in depth.

Chapter  12  defines  the  requirements   and   procedures   regarding   the
preparation  of  auditing  and  processing  of   financial   statements   of
municipalities and municipal entities. It is noteworthy that  the  financial
statements of a  municipality  must  be  submitted  to  the  Auditor-General
within a specific time period.

Indien daar enige sprake is van 'n  ingrypende  aksie  deur  provinsiale  of
nasionale rolspelers, moet streng  neergelegde  prosedures,  soos  deur  die
Grondwet voorgeskryf,  gevolg  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[If there is talk of drastic action by provincial and national  roleplayers,
strict, stipulated procedures, as prescribed by the  Constitution,  must  be
followed.]

The Bill provides for the establishment of a municipal  financial  emergency
authority with  the  main  function  of  overseeing  the  administration  of
municipalities  in  financial  emergency.  The  procedure  to  be   followed
regarding the termination of a financial  emergency  and  the  extraordinary
measures  to  be  taken  if  the  emergency  recovery  plan  proves  to   be
insufficient are provided.

Chapter 15 deals with financial misconduct within  municipalities.  A  legal
regime  is  provided  for  disciplinary   proceedings   and   for   criminal
proceedings  against  municipal   managers,   accounting   authorities   and
officials.

Hierdie wetgewing is so kompleks  van  aard  dat  dit  nie  oornag  in  alle
munisipaliteite  geïmplementeer  kan  word  nie.   Hoofstuk   16   van   die
wetsontwerp maak  voorsiening  vir  'n  infaseringstydperk  waarvolgens  die
wetgewing  ingefaseer  word   betreffende   die   belanghebbende   plaaslike
owerheid.

Die wetsontwerp is 'n  vertrekpunt  wat  poog  om  munisipale  finansies  te
orden. Twee regsmenings  van  senior  regslui  maak  die  stelling  dat  die
wetsontwerp nie strydig met die Grondwet is nie. Die kernbedoeling  van  die
wetsontwerp  is  om  aanvaarbare  rekenkundige  standaarde  en   norme   vir
plaaslike owerhede daar te stel.

Die  magte  van  die  Nasionale  Tesourie  en  provinsiale  owerhede  om  'n
finansiële noodtoestand binne 'n  gegewe  munisipaliteit  te  beredder  geld
slegs as alle wettig voorgeskrewe regstellende stappe gevolg is om die  raad
van 'n munisipaliteit te oortuig om hulle begroting te  aanvaar  en  dienste
aan  hulle  gegewe  teikengemeenskappe  te  lewer.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This legislation is of such a complex nature that it cannot be  implemented
in all municipalities overnight. Chapter 16 of the Bill makes provision  for
a phasing-in period whereby the legislation is phased in  according  to  the
local authority concerned.

The Bill  is  a  point  of  departure  which  tries  to  organise  municipal
finances. Two legal opinions from senior legal people,  made  the  statement
that the Bill is not in conflict with the Constitution. The  main  objective
of the Bill is to put in place acceptable  accounting  norms  and  standards
for local authorities.

The  powers  of  the  National  Treasury  and  provincial   authorities   to
administer a financial state of emergency within a given municipality,  only
apply if all legally prescribed corrective steps were followed  to  convince
the council of a municipality to accept their budget and to render  services
to their target communities. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Local Government: Municipal  Finance
Management Bill is, as the Minister said, the foundation Bill for  financial
management at local government level. It is a long and complex Bill. As  has
been said, we spent a lot of time debating virtually every  clause  of  this
Bill. The Bill before this House today is a redraft  of  the  original  Bill
that came before us and arose out of those discussions.

Let me say that it was a remarkable experience to be able  to  draw  on  the
expertise, experience and energy of another committee  here  in  Parliament,
the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government. Had it not  been
for their participation in  our  work,  we  would  have  been  at  a  severe
disadvantage. They could bring the wealth of their  experience  and  insight
into local government and teach us in ways that we would not have been  able
to do on our own. I want to thank them for their participation.

Equally, I would like to thank the department, the Ministry  for  Provincial
and Local Government, and the Treasury for the time  and  energy  that  they
devoted to participate in the debate on these Bills.  It  was  a  remarkable
experience to  have  two  Government  departments  working  well,  sometimes
robustly - and there were robust debates. Nevertheless,  I  think  that  the
final result was the great value that was added to this Bill.

Finally, let me commend Salga - the SA Local Government  Association.  There
was not one meeting at which Salga was not present. They could  bring  their
considerable experience in local government finance in order to benefit  the
committee.  Let  me  thank  them,  too,  for  their   very   very   valuable
participation. At the end of the day, I hope that we shall have  a  Bill  in
which there is buy-in from all the stakeholders.

This Bill, in effect, addresses some  very  important  stakeholders,  and  I
want to put them into three categories. In  the  first  category  there  are
ordinary residents of a city who want good financial  management  and  value
for their money, and who want to see service delivery arising  out  of  good
and efficient use of resources. The Minister and Dr Rabie  have  spent  some
time going through the provisions of what that would entail, and  I  am  not
going to dwell on that. However, bear in mind that there are very  important
clauses that relate to  the  responsibilities  of  councillors,  mayors  and
municipal officials in regard to the local citizenry.

Furthermore, we  were  able  to  draw  on  a  precedent  set  by  the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act which  has  a  very  strong  and  laudable
emphasis on participatory democracy, accountability and transparency.  Other
important players are provincial and national  governments,  and  provincial
and national organs of state.  For  too  long,  it  has  seemed  that  local
government had to be on the receiving end of whatever came  from  provincial
and national governments. So, for instance, as you would see  later  in  the
debate on the Local Government: Municipal Systems Amendment Bill,  attention
has been given to a situation when  another  sphere  of  government  assigns
additional  functions  to  the  municipality.  There  can  no  longer  be  a
situation where functions are simply assigned.  There  are  conditionalities
attached.

National governments and provincial governments, too, now  have  to  play  a
much more active monitoring role. They  are  bound  by  the  legislation  to
commit  themselves  to  building  the  capacity  of  municipal  governments.
However, most importantly, I think that what was  very  definitive  in  this
Bill was the interventionist role of, particularly,  provincial  governments
when, in the unlikely event - and I  must  stress  ``unlikely  event''  -  a
municipality reaches a stage where its  financial  situation  is  in  severe
crisis. We spent many weeks together with  the  justice  committee  bringing
the amendment to the Constitution in order to unravel just exactly what  the
responsibilities of provincial government are.

For too long, local government has been a  stepchild.  Let  me  say  at  the
outset, after having gone through one and a half years of  looking  at  what
the responsibilities  for  financial  management  are  at  local  government
level,  that  that  sphere  of  government  experiences  more  complex   and
difficult financial arrangements than any other sphere of  government.  And,
too often, that sphere of government has been left to its own  resources  to
try and manage a very, very complex situation.

In order to cater for a situation in which  a  problem  starts  to  manifest
itself in a serious way in a municipality, we have now  built  in  mandatory
interventions   and   assistance   from,   particularly,   the    provincial
governments. No longer would residents of municipalities  be  faced  with  a
situation where a municipality, for  instance,  can't  pass  its  budget  or
where there are such severe financial crises that delivery is impeded.

We have built into this process a mechanism which makes  it  mandatory  upon
the MEC to intervene  through  an  agency  called  the  Municipal  Financial
Recovery Service which  will  be  housed  in  the  National  Treasury.  That
service will intervene, analyse the problems, and put  forward  a  financial
recovery plan which would be approved by the MEC and amended  if  necessary.
The municipality would then approve it; and if not,  the  municipality  gets
dissolved. If there is no meeting of minds on the issue, a new  municipality
would then be elected to implement a financial recovery plan.

I think that this is going to be path-breaking  in  terms  of  interventions
when municipalities hit  crises.  It's  not  only  the  residents  that  are
affected by severe crises in a municipality, it is also the private  sector.
And, this is the third stakeholder that we are looking at in  terms  of  the
Local Government: Municipal  Finance  Management  Act.  The  private  sector
would like to invest and would like to lend. However, up to now, there  have
been particular problems and insecurities  in  lending  that  have  made  it
difficult for municipalities to bring in investment because -  and  bear  in
mind that - most municipalities do not have  sufficient  revenue  to  effect
capital investments which are required. Therefore, they do need to  be  able
to borrow and to bring in alternative investments.

This Bill, in various ways, gives certainty  to  prospective  investors  and
lenders that their interests are secured, and that  they  will  be  able  to
lend with many more guarantees and much more security than they have had  in
the past. Part of that is the mandatory interventions by  other  spheres  of
government once a municipality is unable to meet its financial  commitments.
Those mandatory interventions allow a municipality to  recover  quickly  and
more rapidly than it would have if it was left  to  its  own  devices.  They
spell  out  that  national  and  provincial   governments   must,   as   the
Constitution  envisages,  provide  assistance  to  the   local   sphere   of
government when required. So, the financial  recovery  agency  and  all  the
provisions there are going to be essential for the success of this Bill.

Finally, I just  want  to  go  through  a  couple  of  other  small  points.
Regarding bulk service delivery, too often, municipalities have no say  when
a bulk service provider wants to  increase  the  prices  of  electricity  or
water and they are just left on the receiving  end  of  this.  We  have  now
instituted a  process  that  has  to  be  engaged  in  by  any  national  or
provincial government department and any organ of state that  provides  bulk
service delivery. Hopefully, municipalities  would  then  be  able  to  have
greater intervention and be able to make their views felt, as  well  as  the
National Treasury, Ministry for Provincial and Local Government,  and  other
stakeholders.

Capacity-building has also been raised as a  severe  problem.  Salga  raised
the issue very forcefully with us by saying that although provinces  monitor
what  happens,  no  one  shares  those  results.  It's  now  mandatory  that
provinces must share the results of  their  monitoring  and,  in  that  way,
build up the capacity for municipalities to deliver on their mandate.

I could go on. This Bill will, no doubt, I think, be  the  subject  of  many
discussions.  Municipal  managers   and   chief   financial   officers,   in
particular, would be looking at this Bill with great interest. But,  let  me
say that it is a  giant  leap  ahead  in  realising  what  the  Constitution
envisaged for us. I wish every role-player who  will  be  implementing  this
Bill the very best in doing that. I also look forward  to  seeing  exemplary
financial management in a couple of years' time which  will  be  far  better
than what happens at national and provincial levels. Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. In considering the volume  of
hours and brain  power  that  went  into  this  Bill,  it  would  be  almost
ungracious to suggest that it  was  anything  less  than  perfect.  However,
notwithstanding  its  wealth  of  instruction,  it  does,  indeed,  take  us
forward, as hon Hogan said. I'm going to leave that  to  other  speakers  to
acknowledge.

I wish to express some reservation, in particular regarding  the  regressive
management philosophy to which the Bill subscribes, and I will include  both
general management and financial management.

I think that  the  general  management  observation  falls  under  expanding
international public sector revolution which, over the past  15  years,  has
introduced wide-ranging adaptations of modern  and  successful  organisation
and management  approaches  into  Government.  Essentially,  these  are  the
approaches and methods that  have  brought  the  management  performance  of
leading private sector co-operations to  be  what  it  is  today.  It  is  a
revolution which some of us thought we had joined  when  introducing  modern
practices into the PFMA at the time of its writing, but which,  three  years
down the road, seem to be slowed by a public  sector  inertia  from  certain
quarters.

Now  we  have  the  municipal  equivalent  before  us  which  confirms  this
reluctance somewhat, or is it a lack  of  confidence,  to  join  the  modern
management school? The management approach  being  adopted  in  the  world's
progressive  countries  begins  with  the   flattening   of   organisational
structures  in  the  devolution  of  responsibility  to  a  wider  base   of
officials,  and  giving  them  sufficient  decision-making   authority   and
unabated discretion to achieve predetermined levels of performance.

It  capitalises  on  the  human  initiative  factor  and,  as  such,  avoids
extensive controls and regulations which could leave officials  robotic  and
disinterested, and only  doing  what  is  necessary  to  keep  them  out  of
trouble.

It became  clear  to  me  during  the  processing  of  this  Bill  that  its
paternalistic character emerged from a belief that municipal  officials  are
generally incompetent, dishonest,  lazy  and  devious,  leading  to  a  Bill
designed to control and macro-manage these devious  officials,  rather  than
the opposing  new-era  approach,  which  is  to  stimulate  human  potential
towards the attainment of results.

I now come to financial management observation. In my opinion, a Bill  which
purports, by way of its title, to be about financial  management  should  be
about financial management. Considerably less than  half  of  this  Bill  is
about financial management, as it is properly defined.  It  covers  so  much
else that it would be more  appropriate  in  a  handbook  of  administrative
processes. Financial management particularly in the public sector  is  about
how best  to  achieve  value-for-money  spending,  while  discouraging  risk
through sound internal control and accountability arrangements.
The value for money issue is almost nonexistent  in  the  Bill,  with  three
vague,  single-sentence  references  at  most,  versus,  for   example,   50
references  and  prepositions  detailing  financial  recovery  plans.   Good
financial management assistance,  together  with  the  properly  distributed
responsibilities referred to earlier, as Mervin King often points  out,  are
central for strong corporate governance.

What are these main systems? Are they  budgetary  systems  incorporating  an
accounting system and management of an information system? The Bill does  go
into some detail about how to process the Budget, but  largely  ignores  the
attributes necessary to make the Budget the premier management tool that  it
ought to be.

The accounting system has been given even less attention,  as  is  the  case
with the management information  system.  There  are  reasonable  provisions
concerning year-end reporting, but annual reporting appears  inadequate  for
sound management and accountability. As with the PFMA, the  Bill  admits  to
insisting  on  costing  systems  without  which,  and  as  all   progressive
countries  would  point   out,   terms   like   ``measurable   objectives'',
``performance indicators'', etc, are just filled with jargon.

While acknowledging that much of the Bill consists of sound  instruction,  I
think it could have learned a lot more from certain  PFMA  weaknesses  which
have emerged, and have taken a more modern framework  approach,  set  around
performance-based management systems,  responsibility  and  functions,  risk
management and clearly established accountability arrangements,  in  a  more
coherent and organised way. That would have left us to define  more  clearly
what belongs in law and what belongs in regulation.

I have two remaining issues to  address.  Firstly,  there  is  the  capacity
issue, which has been touched upon. I think against the complex,  burdensome
and sometimes ambiguous demands,  there  must  be  some  concern  about  the
ability of officials to meet  the  challenges  of  the  Bill.  Senior  Salga
representatives have shared this concern, and I can only repeat my  previous
request to the Minister, that he consider  the  establishment  of  a  public
sector financial management college which provides  affordable  and  quality
training to officials of all three levels of government.

Finally, there  is  the  issue  concerning  entities.  This  is  an  awkward
situation of municipal entities and  the  Bill  is  a  contortionist,  which
tried to accommodate these various entities and  their  responsibilities.  I
agree that you have done well under the circumstances, but here  I  want  to
ask the Minister if he  would,  under  advice,  consider  legislation  which
gives birth to a new type of legal entity; one which is especially  designed
to accommodate all entities in which the state, at any level of  government,
has a significant interest.

Further, there is a need to convert all existing entities to  this  type  of
special public entity and to impose this upon  all  new  entities  that  are
formed that fall under this legislation. Thank you.

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I  am  surprised  Dr  Woods
shares his concerns. I just wish he could have shared them with  us  in  the
portfolio committee.

The Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill  is  a  Bill  that
seeks to achieve and  secure  sound  and  sustainable  financial  management
within  municipalities  and  other  institutions  in  the  local  sphere  of
government. Municipalities are responsible  for  providing  basic  household
and suburban services, such as electricity,  water,  sanitation  and  refuse
removal, among other functions provided for in the Constitution.

These services were traditionally  fully  provided  to  formerly  advantaged
communities under the apartheid regime, but were  largely  not  provided  to
former black townships. Therefore,  important  as  financial  accountability
is,  it  is  just  as  important  to  address  the  unfair  distribution  of
resources.  Accountability  is  the  pillar  that  holds   good   governance
together. If you are given a responsibility to deliver a service,  you  also
take on the responsibility to be accountable to those who entrust  you  with
that responsibility.
The caretakers who are entrusted must  ensure  transparency,  accountability
and appropriate lines of responsibility in the fiscal and financial  affairs
of municipalities and their entities. They must manage the budget,  revenue,
expenditure, assets, liabilities and  borrowing,  and  all  other  financial
matters.

This Bill  will  pose  particular  challenges  to  mayors,  chief  executive
officers  and  senior  financial  managers.  They  will  act  as  accounting
officers of municipalities, and will be responsible and accountable  on  all
financial matters.

Chapter 7 of the Bill outlines the responsibility of mayors. The mayor of  a
municipality must provide general political guidance  over  the  fiscal  and
financial affairs of the municipality. Budget processes and related  matters
must project the integrated development plan of the municipality and  ensure
the implementation thereof. He or she must report to the  municipal  council
and the MEC for local government in the province. If there  are  any  delays
in the tabling or approval  of  the  budget,  the  mayor  must  make  public
revenue and expenditure projections once the  service  delivery  and  budget
implementation plan has been approved.

If a municipality does not approve an annual budget or encounters a  serious
financial problem, it is the duty of the mayor  to  immediately  report  the
matter to the MEC for local government in the province, who  will  then  act
on the matter. The mayor  has  sole  or  shared  control  over  a  municipal
entity, and must exercise his or her power by monitoring the performance  of
the entity concerned, but may not  interfere  in  the  performance  of  that
entity. In other words, the  mayor  should  only  be  a  watchdog  over  the
entity.

Regarding municipalities that do not have  mayors,  the  councils  of  those
municipalities must designate a councillor to exercise the power and  duties
to ensure good, clean financial management.

In Chapter 8 the responsibility of  municipal  officials  is  outlined.  The
municipal  manager  is  the  accounting   officer   and   will   take   full
responsibility for the general financial matters  of  the  municipality.  We
recognise that municipalities on their own cannot deliver on all  the  basic
needs of our people,  and  that  certain  competencies  are  out-sourced  to
public-private partnerships or entities. It is for this  reason  that  clear
lines  of  accountability  have  been  outlined  in  the  Bill.  Ultimately,
however, the municipality will be responsible for service delivery.

We depend on  people  to  execute  these  functions,  and  with  humans  you
encounter  strengths  and  weaknesses.  Therefore,  the  human  weakness  of
financial misconduct is addressed in this Bill. If there  is  misconduct  by
municipal officials and officials of municipal entities, be it  deliberately
or negligently, or as a result of gross negligence, it must be  investigated
and the necessary steps must  be  taken  against  such  officials.  This  is
outlined in Chapter 15.

We must thank those mayors, management and workers who  work  tirelessly  to
ensure that services  are  delivered  in  our  cities  and  to  our  people.
However, certain weaknesses have to be addressed, and we hope  that  passing
this Bill will assist municipalities.

The Bill must not be interpreted to mean that  National  Treasury  wants  to
control or even dictate to local authorities  on  their  financial  matters,
but should  be  seen  as  setting  out  ways  for  national  and  provincial
governments to support and strengthen the capacity of the municipality.

The challenge now is to translate these best  practice  policy  reforms,  as
outlined in the Bill,  and  put  them  into  practice,  which  will  have  a
positive impact on the financial accountability of the municipality.

Madam Deputy Speaker, the ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Madam Deputy Speaker, the  Bill  before  us  is  a  natural
offspring of the Public Finance Management Act that secures  the  sound  and
sustainable management of the financial affairs of  central  and  provincial
government in South Africa.

It  strives  to  secure  standards  for  recognised   accounting   practices
applicable to municipalities or municipal  entities.  It  establishes  norms
and standards for the management of the revenues, expenditures,  assets  and
liabilities  of  local  governments.  It  lays  down  the  requirements  for
borrowing,  budgeting  and  financial  planning  of  the   third   tier   of
government.

The main objective of this Bill, to my mind, is  to  secure  accountability,
transparency and the appropriate lines of responsibility in the  fiscal  and
financial affairs of local government. Both mayors  and  municipal  managers
are now held responsible by law to accept the responsibility  for  both  the
decisions they take, as well as the way  in  which  there  are  funded  with
taxpayers' money.

The chief  executive  officer  of  a  municipality  becomes  the  accounting
officer. He or she takes full responsibility for the administration of  such
a municipality. Political accountability  is  vested  in  the  mayor.  There
shall  be  full  transparency  in  financial  management.   The   funds   to
municipalities committing serious or persistent  breaches  of  the  measures
established in terms of section 216 of the Constitution may be stopped.  The
governance  of  such  municipalities  may   even,   under   certain   severe
conditions, be taken over by a provincial or the central government.

The  far-reaching  powers  bestowed  upon  first  and  second   spheres   of
government are questioned by some people. It is argued that  the  Bill  will
tempt irresponsible  governments  and  irresponsible  political  leaders  to
interfere in governments of lower spheres or even grab political power  from
such governments much too easily. It is also being argued  that  it  may  be
unconstitutional for a government of a higher sphere  to  intervene  in  the
affairs of a lower sphere of government.

The New NP is in favour of punitive measures being put in  place  to  ensure
that a government of a higher level may take responsibility to intervene  in
cases of persistent malpractice by lower spheres of  government,  but  warns
against unwanted and improper interference by power-drunk politicians.

Rumours have it that the stipulations of the MFMB will take up to 18  months
to implement. The New NP therefore  challenges  all  the  responsible  local
governments to voluntarily, as from tomorrow, adhere to the  guidelines  for
good governance laid down by this Bill until such time  that  it  officially
becomes law. It may have been only a relatively small  step  for  Parliament
to pass the MFMB, even though it took three years to do so, but the Bill  is
certainly a giant step towards good governance at local government level.

The New NP therefore supports the Bill.

Mnr A BLAAS: Adjunkspeaker, die  negatiewe  ervarings  in  die  bestuur  van
openbare fondse in die algemeen en meer spesifiek  in  die  munisipaliteite,
bepaal  die  behoeftes  van  hierdie  wetgewing.  Die   oogmerke   van   die
wetsontwerp, klousule 2, is binne grondwetlike bepalings hierop gemik.
Die ACDP sal hierdie wetsontwerp steun.

Die wetgewing bepaal dat munisipaliteite aan streng voorskrifte ten  opsigte
van finansiële bestuur moet voldoen. Sien hoofstukke 4, 7, 8, 9 en  12.  Dit
verg egter besondere kapasiteit binne elke munisipaliteit.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Deputy Speaker, the negative experiences with public  funds  management  in
general, and more specifically in municipalities, have determined  the  need
for this legislation. Within constitutional provisions,  this  is  what  the
objectives of the Bill, clause 2, are aimed at.

The ACDP will support this Bill.

This legislation determines  that  municipalities  must  conform  to  strict
prescriptions regarding financial management. See chapters 4, 7,  8,  9  and
12. However, this requires exceptional capacity within each municipality.]

Chapter 10 deals  specifically  with  co-operative  government.  It  commits
national and provincial governments to assisting municipalities in capacity-
building. It binds national and provincial departments and  public  entities
to specific performance criteria in relation to municipal entities. It  also
clearly describes a mandate of Treasury in terms of their relationship  with
municipal entities.

The Bill prescribes very specific responsibilities to the mayor in terms  of
the financial management process set  out  in  Chapter 7.  He  is  basically
responsible for ensuring that financial matters of a  municipal  entity  are
managed within prescribed timeframes and set standards.  He  must  also,  in
reasonable time,  report  financial  problems.  Noncompliance  may  lead  to
termination of his position and even to the cessation of  the  council.  The
establishment of an independent audit committee in clause 166  needs  to  be
highlighted.  It  will  ensure  objective  evaluation   of   the   financial
management process.

An interesting and innovative introduction to this piece of  legislation  is
a recovery mechanism in case of financial problems, which is in Chapter  13.
This is a commitment to ensuring that community service is not compromised.

The need for this legislation  cannot  be  disputed.  It  is  involved,  but
necessary, well-considered and commits all relevant  spheres  of  government
to ensure sound financial management for  municipal  entities.  It  is  thus
supported.

Mnr  P  J  GROENEWALD:  Agb  mevrou  die  Adjunkspeaker,  die  Vryheidsfront
verwelkom hierdie wetsontwerp en steun dit. Die rede is  dat  die  finansies
op plaaslike regeringsvlak, na die  mening  van  die  Vryheidsfront,  in  'n
chaotiese toestand is.

Ek wil vandag vir die  agb  Minister  sê  dat  as  dit  gaan  oor  plaaslike
regering en hulle finansies, is hulle in  dryfsand  en  hulle  is  besig  om
verder en verder af te sak. Die gevolg, aan die einde van die  dag,  is  dat
die belastingbetalers van 'n plaaslike regering meer belas moet word.  Hulle
tariewe moet styg omdat munisipaliteite nie meer die  behoorlike  finansiële
dissipline het om toe te sien dat hulle 'n behoorlike kontantvloei het  nie.
Daarom verwelkom ons hierdie wetsontwerp.

As ons hierdie wetsontwerp 'n  sukses  wil  laat  wees,  sal  ons  ook  moet
verseker dat die amptenary weet wat aangaan in hierdie wet. Ek  aanvaar  dat
daar behoorlike opleiding gegee sal  word,  en  dat  munisipale  bestuurders
byvoorbeeld sal besef wat hulle verantwoordelikheid is.

Ek dink nie dit is  billik  en  regverdig  as  belastingbetalers  munisipale
bestuurders  se  salarisse  moet  betaal,  waarvan  sommige  s'n  selfs   'n
halfmiljoen meer is as wat die agbare Staatspresident  ontvang,  en  dan  is
dit  die  tipe  van  finansiële  toestande  waarin  ons  munisipaliteite  se
finansies is nie.

As 'n mens verder in ag neem dat  die  agterstallige  dienstegelde  landswyd
reeds meer as R25 miljard ten opsigte van  plaaslike  regering  is,  sê  die
Vryheidsfront dat hierdie wetsontwerp eintlik al vroeër moes gekom het.  Ons
hoop nie dit is te min vir te laat nie. Die werklikheid, as ons gaan kyk  na
die agterstallige diensgelde, is dat dit amper  een  en  'n  half  keer  die
totale verdedigingsbegroting is. Ons kan nie so aangaan nie. Dit is tyd  dat
amptenare, en veral munisipale bestuurders, asook uitvoerende  burgemeesters
wat groot salarisse ontvang, na die finansies van belastingbetalers  omsien.
Hulle moet dié verantwoordelikheid nakom. Dankie, mevrou die  Adjunkspeaker.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  Freedom  Front  welcomes
this Bill and supports it. The reason for this is  that  finances  at  local
government level are, in the opinion of the  Freedom  Front,  in  a  chaotic
state.

I want to say  to  the  hon  the  Minister  today  that,  as  far  as  local
government and their finances are concerned,  they  are  in  quicksand,  and
they are sinking deeper and deeper into it. The ultimate result is that  the
taxpayers of a local government must  be  taxed  at  a  higher  rate.  Their
tariffs must increase because  municipalities  no  longer  have  the  proper
financial discipline to ensure that they have a proper cash flow.  For  this
reason we welcome this Bill.

If we want this  Bill  to  be  successful  we  must  also  ensure  that  the
officials know what this Bill is about. I assume  proper  training  will  be
provided, and that municipal managers will know,  for  example,  what  their
responsibility is.

I do not think it is fair and just for taxpayers to pay municipal  managers'
salaries, some of which are even half a million rand more  than  that  which
the hon the State President receives, whilst this is the sort  of  financial
state our municipalities' finances are in.

Furthermore, if one takes into account that the service fees in arrears  are
already more than R25 billion countrywide with regard to  local  government,
the Freedom Front says that this  Bill  should  actually  have  been  tabled
earlier. We hope it is not too little, too late. In reality, if we  look  at
the arrears service fees, we see that they are equal to  almost  one  and  a
half times the amount of the total defence budget.  We  cannot  go  on  like
this. The time has come for officials, and  especially  municipal  managers,
as well as executive mayors who receive  big  salaries  to  look  after  the
finances of taxpayers. They must  fulfil  this  responsibility.  Thank  you,
Madam Deputy Speaker.]

Mr F C FANKOMO:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  promulgation  of  the  Public
Finance Management  Act  in  1999  marked  a  very  important  step  in  the
implementation  of  the  financial  provisions  of   chapter   13   of   the
constitutional Act of 1996.

Today, again, we are debating another very important  piece  of  legislation
that pertains to financial matters at the delivery point of our  Government.
The Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill  seeks  to  ensure
secure,  sound  and  sustainable  management   of   financial   affairs   of
municipalities at local government level.

In order to do this, the municipalities require budgets.  As  we  know,  the
source of budgets at  local  government  level  is  greatly  dependent  upon
national funding and revenue collected through taxation. In terms of  clause
17(2), local government also gets some funding from  borrowings.  The  money
that is being borrowed is used for capital projects.

The council of a municipality must first consider all the project costs  for
that financial year until the project is operational, before  approving  the
project. Thus, by so doing, the municipal budgets and budget processes  will
promote transparency, accountability and effective financial  management  of
the  economy.  The  public  sector,  thus,  is  one  of  the  constitutional
requirements that characterise democratic elements.

Municipal budgets, according to section 215(2)(c) of the Constitution,  must
show the sources of revenue and the way in which proposed  expenditure  will
comply with national legislation. The  structure  of  the  municipal  budget
must  contain  estimates  of  revenue  and  expenditure,  and  differentiate
between the capital and current  expenditure.  It  must,  further,  have  an
indication of intentions regarding borrowing and other forms of  liabilities
that will increase public debt during the ensuing year.

The mayor of a municipality is mandated by this  Bill  to  table  an  annual
budget at a council meeting 90 days before the start  of  the  budget  year.
The council, therefore, must approve  the  budget.  This  budget  should  be
divided into two, that is capital expenditure and operational  budget.  This
is in line with the  international  best  practice.  Documents  that  should
accompany the tabling of the budget are  draft  resolutions  such  as  those
approving the municipal budget, imposing  municipal  taxation  and  tariffs,
and approving the budget for municipal entities and so forth.

After tabling the  municipal  budget,  the  accounting  officer  makes  this
public and invites community members to come and submit  their  inputs.  The
budget is submitted in printed electronic format to the  National  Treasury.
This fund lapses when there is no money that has been spent by  the  end  of
the year.

Regarding financial reporting, this Bill  provides  that  the  council  must
prepare reports within six months regarding the activities of the  municipal
council. These  annual  reports  provide  a  record  of  activities  of  the
municipality and its entities during the financial year.

A report on performance against the budget promotes  accountability  to  the
community for decisions  made  throughout  the  year.  Reports  include  the
Auditor-General's  auditing   reports,   consolidated   statements,   annual
performance and any explanation that may be necessary to clarify  issues  in
connection with financial statements.

Issues raised by the Auditor-General's report will enable  the  municipality
to correct and ensure compliance with this  Bill.  Duties  that  are  placed
with the provincial MEC are to ensure that issues  raised  by  the  Auditor-
General are corrected within the municipality. I thank you. [Applause.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi! [In the name of women!]  Madam  Deputy
Speaker, the MF notes the immense power and authority that this Bill  yields
to National Treasury. It  is  hoped  that  its  wide  range  of  duties  and
responsibilities  are  within  means  to  ensure   proper   management   and
efficiency of roles.

The  MF  is  pleased  with  the  authority  and  responsibility   given   to
municipalities,  in  the  light  of  financial  management  for  which   the
financial reports will maintain assurance  of  proper  management  regarding
public inspection. Provisions appear to be constitutional.  These  financial
independencies are quite liberating for local  government.  Provisions  made
in respect of municipal budgets are supported by the MF.

In terms of debts incurred by the municipalities, the MF has  no  objections
to  provisions  made  in  the  light  of  short-term  and  long-term  debts.
Regarding the responsibilities of municipal officials, the MF  is  satisfied
with the provisions that this Bill makes.
It is, however, felt that the responsibility for financial matters  that  is
placed on municipal council members is immense. The need  for  accuracy  and
efficiency, if strictly adhered to, would make  this  cumbersome  duty  more
comfortable. Provisions made in terms  of  the  establishment  of  municipal
entities are acceptable, in the light of regulatory powers and functions.

The MF is especially pleased  with  the  financial  reporting  and  auditing
provisions put in place to ensure proper  management  of  affairs,  accuracy
and efficiency to the public. The resolution of financial problems,  general
Treasury matters and provisions regarding  financial  misconduct  are  well-
devised.

The MF feels that this Bill has done a good  job  of  addressing  issues  of
transparency, accountability and sound management of municipal  finances  to
suit our democracy  and  abide  with  constitutional  requirements.  The  MF
supports the financial management Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, derdevlakregering is  van  kritiese  belang
vir die toekoms van Suid-Afrika. Die sukses van Suid-Afrika staan of val  by
wat op derdevlakregering gebeur, daar waar ons  die  naaste  aan  die  mense
kom.

Die Nasionale Aksie is ten gunste van 'n maksimale afwenteling van gesag  na
derdevlakowerhede toe. Daar is egter 'n probleem: Hoe meer jy afwentel,  hoe
meer draf jy met jou derde span op die veld. Daarom verwelkom die  Nasionale
Aksie die maatreëls  van  beheer  en  verantwoorbaarheid  deur  en  aan  die
provinsiale en nasionale owerhede wat in hierdie wetsontwerp ingebou is.

Ons verwelkom die  feit  van  'n  behoorlike  begroting,  want  dis  krities
belangrik. Die driejaarbegrotingsraamwerk werk goed op nasionale  vlak.  Ons
glo dit sal ook met munisipale vlak so  werk.  Die  begrotingsvereistes  wat
gestel word  is  billik,  en  dit  sal  goeie  beheer  verseker,  asook  die
maatreëls vir samewerkende regering wat in hierdie wetsontwerp vervat is.

Oor die algemeen kan aanvaar word  dat  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  ekonomie  goed
bestuur word. Ongelukkig kan dieselfde nie van die plaaslike  owerhede  gesê
word nie. Jy kan die beste sisteem hê, maar dit kan val  by  die  uitvoering
daarvan. Papier is geduldig. My begroting werk ook, maar net op papier.  Dit
hang af hoe hierdie saak beheer gaan word.

As 'n mens kyk  na  artikel  78(c)  van  die  wetsontwerp,  dan  is  dit  'n
verantwoordelikheid dat  ``any  unauthorised,  irregular  or  fruitless  and
wasteful expenditure and any other losses are prevented''.

Die vraag is: In hoe 'n mate gaan hierdie artikel gebruik word  om  die  R25
miljard wat aan plaaslike owerhede verskuldig is aan bande te lê,  want  dit
is 'n ``fruitless expenditure''?  Verder,  dat  ``All  revenue  due  to  the
municipality is collected.''

Dit kan alleen gebeur as personeel volgens  meriete  en  ervaring  aangestel
word, en nie volgens ander maatstawwe nie.
Voorsitter, die Nasionale Aksie ondersteun hierdie  wetgewing,  maar  onthou
die woorde: ``Talk is cheap,  but  money  buys  the  whisky''.  Ek  dank  u.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy  Speaker,  third-tier  government  is  of  critical
importance for South Africa's future. The success of South Africa stands  or
falls by what happens in third-tier  government,  there  where  we  get  the
closest to the people.

The National Action is in favour of maximal devolvement of power  to  third-
tier authorities. However, there is a problem: the more  you  delegate,  the
more you run onto the field with your third team.  Therefore,  the  National
Action welcomes the measures of control and accountability  by  and  to  the
provincial and national authorities which are incorporated into this Bill.

We welcome  the  fact  that  there  is  proper  budgeting  because  this  is
critically important.  The  three-yearly  budget  framework  works  well  at
national level. We believe that it will also work  like  this  at  municipal
level. The budgetary requirements that are laid  down  are  reasonable,  and
will  ensure  good  control,  as  well  as  the  measures  for  co-operative
governance which are contained in this Bill.

In general, it can be accepted that  the  South  African  economy  is  being
managed well. Unfortunately the same cannot be said  of  local  authorities.
You can have the best system, but it can crumble in  its  operations.  Paper
is patient. My budget is also working, but only on paper. It depends on  how
this matter is going to be controlled.

When one looks at section 78(c) of the Bill, then  it  is  a  responsibility
that: ``any unauthorised, irregular or fruitless  and  wasteful  expenditure
and any other losses are prevented''.

The question is: To what extent will this section be used to  curb  the  R25
billion which is owed to local authorities,  because  it  is  a  ``fruitless
expenditure''? Furthermore, that: ``All revenue due to the  municipality  is
collected''.
It  can  only  happen  if  staff  are  appointed  according  to  merit   and
experience, and not according to other criteria.

Chairperson, the National Action supports  this  legislation,  but  remember
these words: ``Talk is cheap, but money buys the whisky''. I thank you.]

Mr B M SOLO: Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Portfolio  Committee  on
Provincial and Local Government, I would like to echo the gratitude  of  our
chairperson, Comrade Yunus Carrim, for the excellent  co-operation  that  we
received from the chairperson of  the  finance  committee,  Comrade  Barbara
Hogan.

The Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill is one of the  major
Bills in the consolidation of the new system of local  government.  We  hope
that the Bill would introduce stable and  sustainable  financial  management
in the sphere of local government.

A lot of reference has been made with regard to Chapter 4 of the  Bill,  and
I am not going to repeat that, except to say  that  revenue  projections  in
the budget must be realistic, taking into account the projected revenue  for
the current year which is based on collection  levels  to  date  and  actual
revenue collection in previous financial years. We are consciously aware  of
the debt that exists there. Our role, as legislators, is to try  and  assist
municipalities to get out of that situation, and that is the  responsibility
of everybody in this House.

We believe that the provisions in Chapter 4 will  place  the  municipalities
on  a  sound  financial  base.  The  clauses  compel  municipalities  to  be
realistic when they draw up their  budgets,  and  thus  avoid,  to  a  large
degree, the possibility of overspending.

Chapter  5  of  the  Bill  addresses  co-operative  governance   in   budget
preparations, which is  an  area  that  our  portfolio  committee  has  been
grappling with consistently.  Provinces  have  a  responsibility  to  assist
municipalities align their budgets and activities with the  budgets  of  the
municipalities  in  the  integrated  development  programmes  -  IDPs.  This
chapter is explicit  on  the  vital  role  to  be  played  by  national  and
provincial governments  in  building  the  capacity  of  municipalities  for
efficient, effective and transparent financial management. To this end,  the
assistance  must  be  by  agreement  between  the  respective   spheres   of
government.

There is also another dimension with  regard  to  local  government,  namely
entities that are  contracted  to  ensure  service  provision  in  the  most
effective, efficient and sustainable way.  The  Bill,  through  Chapter  10,
brings a lot of sanity in this regard. We note and  appreciate  the  various
partnerships with the whole range of sectors aimed at  ensuring  sustainable
provisions of services and development.

Kodwa-ke kubalulekile ukuthi uma senza wonke lama-entity sibonakalise  obala
ukuthi umsebenzi okufanele bawenze bawenza ngendlela engcono neyenza  ukuthi
izimpilo zethu zibe nokuthuthuka. Esikhathini esiningi siye  sithole  ukuthi
uma kwenziwa lama- entity, amanye awo abhekene  namangcwaba,  ugcina  ungabe
usazi ukuthi kuzokwenziwani emangcwabeni yinkontileka yabantu.

Yibo-ke  ubuthakathaka  obukhona  lobo,  okuzothi  ngalo   mThethosivivinywa
esikhuluma ngawo sizame ukuthi sibulungise. (Translation of Zulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[However, it is important that if we form all these entities  we  make  sure
that they do the  task  at  hand  in  a  better  way  that  results  in  the
improvement of our lives. In  most  cases  one  finds  that  some  of  these
entities, for instance, will target  graveyards,  and  one  wonders  what  a
people's contract has to do with graveyards.

That is the kind of weakness which prevails at present and which we are  set
to correct through this Bill under discussion.]

This Bill introduces mechanisms to oversee the  activities  of  the  various
entities.  It  obliges  municipalities  not  to   abdicate   their   overall
responsibilities and functions in order to ensure extension of services  for
a better life for all. Chapter  10  of  the  Bill  deals  with  this  matter
extensively, but what is important is that it  promotes  more  transparency,
stability and predictability and thus strengthens governance on finances.

Let me not hesitate to mention that the Portfolio  Committee  on  Provincial
and Local Government  recognises  the  leadership  role  played  by  Comrade
Barbara Hogan who consistently highlighted key issues on fiscal  discipline.
In certain instances, we may have been  found  irritating,  but  this  might
emanate from our limited understanding of economics.  Indeed,  we  learnt  a
lot from her and her committee. It was a great pleasure  to  work  with  her

Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[I would like to address myself to our brothers and sisters in  the  FF  and
tell them that they should stop criticising all the time.  Let  us  all  try
and work together because we know the origin of  municipality  problems.  We
used to pay without getting services, and we had no way of even asking  what
it was we were paying for.

It is not just individuals who owe  the  municipality.  I  think  that  some
research was done which revealed that there are  some  companies  which  can
afford to pay, but are not willing to do so and expect to  be  reminded  all
the time because they say the land had been taken. That is all they know.

When they are here they have a lot to say, yet they are  not  actually  part
of what we are doing. They are only here to while away the time.  They  must
start being committed and represent their  people  properly.  They  have  to
realise the problems we are facing in this country, so that we can all  work
together properly and solve those problems.

A lot has been said, and I do not want to spoil  such  a  good  thing.  This
Bill is very good and the ANC is very happy with it. I  have  also  listened
to people in the rural areas telling me that they appreciate it.

With those few words, I would like to say thank you. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Speaker,  Msholozi,  hon  members,  firstly,
thank you for the broad support for the Local Government: Municipal  Finance
Management Bill. I think, in the nature  of  the  debate  here  and  in  the
nature of the many hearings that have been held on  this  legislation,  it's
abundantly clear that all members of this House attach much  weight  to  the
value of local government in delivering not only in terms of  services  but,
very importantly, in terms of the developmental mandate.

The hon Woods raised a number of issues about the  approach  that  we  might
have considered. What we cannot escape from is that local authorities,  like
national  and   provincial   governments,   handle   public   money.   Local
authorities, in distinction to provincial governments, collect the  bulk  of
their own revenue. In circumstances like these we need to  ensure  that  the
rules are in place. It is not about national Government playing  nanny,  but
about ensuring that we have mechanisms in place that increase the  level  of
accountability. By doing  so,  we  are  improving  on  the  quality  of  our
democracy.

That is the bulk of what this issue is about. In order to  traverse  a  past
from where some local governments are now,  which  is  at  a  very  perilous
state, to what the Bill describes, we have to be organic. To release all  of
the controls will, I think, create mayhem which will see the poorest of  the
poor suffering the most.

The approach we  are  taking  here  is,  in  fact,  in  recognition  of  the
independence and also of the interdependence of this  particular  sphere  of
government. With the help of the three committees that  have  been  involved
in this process - the Portfolio Committee on Finance, and the committees  on
provincial and local government, and on justice - I think we  have  got  the
balance right.

What is very important is that the 284  local  authorities  become  learning
organisations in their own name and right. Many organisations  transform  at
their own pace. We've asked, as a very  important  support  mechanism,  both
the Institute for Public Finance and Auditing, Ipfa, and  the  Institute  of
Municipal  Finance  Officers,  Imfo,  to  be  there  and  to   carry   these
organisations. We are a little bit averse to creating new institutions.

I am hearing for the first time the proposals about new legislation for  new
public entities. I'd like to know what the mischief is that we need to  fix.
I'd like to know where these arise in the context of the  Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Bill. However, what's very  important  is  that
we leave this House recognising the importance of  municipal  government  in
the context of development, that we support them every step of  the  way  to
deliver services and development and, very importantly, that they  are  able
to be publicly accountable for what they do.

The other provisions about aligning  the  IDPs  and  the  Budget,  I  think,
provide that impetus, and I'd like to thank all the parties  for  supporting
this legislation. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

             LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL SYSTEMS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Deputy  Speaker,
hon members, on 5 December, three months from now, our new system  of  local
government will be three years old. It is critical  that  our  deliberations
here today appreciate the noble and gallant efforts that  we  have  made  in
establishing and consolidating this sphere of government  since  5  December
2000.

Today we have 284 municipalities established, which are led by  a  cadreship
of over 8 000 councillors who are responsible for over 3 700 wards. We  must
commend our councillors  who  have  pioneered  this  new  system  for  their
commitment, dedication and resilience and for sometimes working  under  very
difficult circumstances. Nobody is actually applauding the  fact  that  they
work so hard, but anyway.

Together with local  government,  national  and  provincial  government  are
currently in a phase  of  consolidating  the  core  developmental  municipal
systems that we envisioned in the White Paper on Local  Government  in  1998
and subsequently articulated in the Local Government: Municipal Systems  Act
of 2000. The final stage of local government transformation is  an  integral
part of our strategic objective of stabilising  our  entire  system  of  co-
operative government as we approach the end of the first decade  of  freedom
and democracy.

In celebrating 10 years of freedom and democracy, we must reflect  on  where
we have come from and the gains that we have made as a nation.  It  is  also
important for us to assess progress and  propose  and  implement  additional
measures that will firmly entrench  the  developmental  orientation  of  the
state and all its organs. Our single motivating objective in addressing  the
inequitable legacy of apartheid is that of  improving  the  quality  of  the
lives of all our people as we strive to build a united nonsexist,  nonracial
and democratic South Africa.

The Local Government: Municipal Systems Amendment Bill before  us  today  is
an important milestone in the  trajectory  towards  creating  a  sustainable
local government sphere. The significance and rationale of this  legislation
is that it seeks to confirm and defend the existing policy orientation  that
we  have  adopted  on  developmental  local  government.  It  must  also  be
mentioned at the outset that this Bill is largely  a  consequential  set  of
amendments arising from the Local Government: Municipal  Finance  Management
Bill, which we have just debated.

The Local Government: Municipal  Systems  Act  of  2000  outlined  the  core
systems  of  community  participation,  integrated   development   planning,
municipal service delivery and  performance  management  that  underpin  our
system of local government.

The  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems  Amendment  Bill  proposes   key
refinements to the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act of 2000.  In  the
first instance, these amendments are central in our  efforts  to  strengthen
the core systems of local government. In our view, the past three  years  of
local government  and  of  municipal  service  delivery  have  yielded  some
significant lessons and observations which require regulatory  intervention.
Of paramount importance is our objective of  addressing  and  resolving  the
critical implementation changes arising from existing policy.

Secondly,  we  live   in   a   political   democracy   where   our   elected
representatives must account to our people  on  their  elected  mandate.  An
important lesson that we have learnt in the last  few  years  of  democratic
local government is that we must continuously  find  ways  of  strengthening
the political oversight  role  of  councillors  in  municipal  affairs,  and
municipal service delivery in particular.

Thirdly, this Bill is aimed at complementing  the  proposed  legislation  on
municipal finance management that has just been debated and passed  by  this
House today. All of us would agree that  our  municipal  finance  management
systems require  urgent  attention.  In  our  view,  the  municipal  finance
management legislation will go a long way in addressing the challenges  that
we have identified.  Together,  the  two  Bills  being  debated  today  will
fortify the foundation of our  system  of  local  government  that  we  have
already started building.

Finally, consistent  with  the  approach  taken  by  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Systems Act of  2000,  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems
Amendment Bill encompasses a delicate combination of enabling and  mandatory
provisions. The mandatory provisions reflect the cardinal policy  principles
that are indispensable to our  vision  of  developmental  local  government,
while the enabling provisions cater for  provincial  and  local  specificity
and conditions in giving effect to our policy.

Although the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Systems  Amendment  Bill  seems
limited in scope, it is far-reaching in its  application.  Let  us  for  the
moment reflect on some of the key provisions and policy  thrusts  that  this
Bill  seeks  to  impart.  The  process  whereby  national   and   provincial
government  departments  are  assigning  powers  and  functions   to   local
government  is  currently  taking  place  both  consciously  and,  in   some
instances, unintentionally.

The Bill requires of those introducing legislation of this nature to  do  so
in such a manner that national and provincial governments can  appropriately
and timeously anticipate, plan, manage and resource these  assignments.  The
policy message is that we  need  to  make  our  system  of  government  more
predictable and transparent with  regard  to  how  national  and  provincial
governments specifically interact with local government.

Further, in an effort to enhance  community  participation  and  make  local
government more accessible and transparent, the Bill outlines the  necessary
mechanisms for increased access to public  documents  of  the  municipality.
These mechanisms  include  dissemination  of  information  by  the  relevant
municipal offices and through an official website of  the  municipality,  if
one exists. These provisions will  not  only  deepen  our  system  of  local
governance, but will also have the value of facilitating  co-ordination  and
integration between organs of state in the three spheres of Government.

We have recognised the challenge faced by many municipalities of  attracting
and retaining competent and skilled personnel. This is especially  the  case
in respect of municipal managers  and  those  who  directly  report  to  the
municipal manager. This Bill further seeks to  ensure  complementarity  with
the provisions of the Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill,
and also confirms the principle  of  linking  the  awarding  of  performance
bonuses to a formal process of performance evaluation.

The objective of enhancing and broadening municipal service delivery is  one
that must continue to seize our attention across all  spheres  and  arms  of
Government. On this very important matter the  Bill  proposes  a  number  of
measures aimed at: assisting municipalities to engage in a much more  robust
and thorough process of deciding  on  the  benefits  of  external  municipal
service delivery options; rationalising the regulatory environment  for  the
establishment of municipal entities in order to limit the  liabilities  that
such entities may impose; clarifying the governance  arrangements  of  these
municipal entities; strengthening the  political  oversight  of  councillors
over such entities and lastly, allowing for  transitional  arrangements  for
existing  municipal  entities  in  a  manner  that  protects  current   good
practice.
This Bill requires municipalities to undertake  a  feasibility  study  which
will force them to make  well-informed  decisions  regarding  the  available
options in municipal service delivery. The recent  lessons  we  have  learnt
from some of the long-term contracts which municipalities have entered  into
point to,  amongst  other  things,  inadequate  preplanning  and  a  limited
consideration of all the envisaged  cost  implications,  benefits  and  risk
factors. An important element of  this  provision  is  the  requirement  for
national and provincial government to assist municipalities  in  taking  the
feasibility  study,  if  such  assistance  is  indeed   requested   by   the
municipality.

The  Bill  reinforces  the  prerogative  of  municipalities   to   establish
municipal entities consistent  with  the  constitutional  mandate  given  to
local government. However, it limits the scope of  municipal  entities  that
may be established to three kinds of entities. These are  private  companies
in  terms  of  the  Companies   Act,   the   service   utilities   and   the
multijurisdictional  service  utilities.  The  new  provisions  broaden  the
purpose of these municipal  entities  to  include  the  performance  of  any
municipal power or function.

The Bill seeks to ensure that good corporate  governance  principles  inform
the  operation  of  these  municipal  entities,  whilst  at  the  same  time
balancing the imperative of  political  oversight.  For  example,  the  Bill
makes provision for municipal representatives to attend all meetings of  the
board of directors. This oversight  role  is  further  enhanced  by  various
reporting obligations between the municipal entity and the municipality.

The Bill is  sensitive  to  the  wide  array  of  well-performing  municipal
entities that currently exist in that the transitional arrangements  in  the
Bill allow these entities to continue to exist, in so  far  as  they  comply
with this legislation. I would like to reiterate that at the end of the  day
all the amendments contained  in  this  Bill  strengthen  and  increase  the
predictability of the new local government system.

We would like to acknowledge the commendable  work  done  by  the  Portfolio
Committees on Finance and on  Provincial  and  Local  Government  and  their
support staff in jointly processing this Bill. We have  taken  note  of  the
report on the Local Government: Municipal Systems Amendment Bill  tabled  by
the portfolio committee. The Ministry and the Department of  Provincial  and
Local  Government  will  continue  to  interact  with  the   committee   and
Parliament in all the relevant matters raised in this report.

The project of local government transformation in this country  is  informed
and driven by the interests of a plethora of stakeholders, institutions  and
organisations. Therefore, we must also  express  our  appreciation  for  the
substantial number of submissions and invaluable comments that  we  received
from the various sectors of our society.

We also wish to thank  Salga  for  their  contribution  in  the  legislative
process. As I mentioned earlier, we are three months away  from  celebrating
the three years of our new system  of  developmental  local  government.  In
celebrating  this  event,  one  of  the  initiatives  that  our   department
announced in June this year was the Vuna Awards for municipalities. This  is
a  municipal  performance  excellence  awards  initiative  which  seeks   to
encourage constructive competition between municipalities.

The first national performance  excellence  awards  to  municipalities  will
take place on  5  December  this  year.  In  the  build-up  to  this  event,
provinces  will  be  recognising  and  presenting   awards   for   municipal
performance excellence between September and November.

We are confident that this legislation  will  greatly  enhance  the  current
systems and performance of municipalities. The  Local  Government  Municipal
Finance Management Bill together with the Municipal Systems  Amendment  Bill
will be an important step in South Africa's  local  government  history.  We
commend this Local Government: Municipal  Systems  Amendment  Bill  to  this
House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Mr Chairperson, Deputy President, comrades  and  friends,  as
you have heard, this Bill effectively flows from the amendments  that  arose
while  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance  was  processing   the   Local
Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill.

Essentially, as people have indicated, the Bill  serves  to  strengthen  the
governance role of municipalities in respect of municipal entities  and  the
assignment of new powers and functions to local government by  national  and
provincial governments.

Municipalities  have  long   complained   that   national   and   provincial
governments assign new powers and functions to them without giving them  the
money to carry these out. The space  for  these  unfunded  mandates  is  now
considerably reduced. The full financial implications of  these  assignments
have to be spelt out before they can  be  effected,  and  the  role  of  the
Financial and Fiscal Commission in this regard has  been  strengthened.  The
capacity of municipalities to carry out these assignments  also  has  to  be
assessed at the outset.
So, to  ensure  greater  municipal  control  of  municipal  entities,  these
entities are now limited, as explained by the Deputy  Minister,  to  private
companies, service  utilities  and  multijurisdictional  service  utilities.
However, they can be established  not  just  to  provide  services,  but  to
fulfil other municipal functions as well.

For example, an entity could  be  established  not  just  to  provide  water
services, but also to carry out  the  function  of  water  meter-reading.  A
municipal entity may also be established to carry  out  municipal  functions
that do not necessarily relate to municipal services such as  the  provision
of information technology support to a municipality. This expanded  role  is
explained in greater detail in our report to Parliament which is carried  in
Monday's Announcements, Tablings and Committee Reports.

It needs to  be  mentioned  that  sections  of  Salga  initially  felt  that
councillors should serve on the board of directors of municipal entities  to
ensure accountability. However, after concerted negotiations with  Salga,  a
consensus emerged that councillors and officials should be  nonparticipating
observers  at  board  meetings  and  that   other   provisions   should   be
strengthened  to  ensure  this  accountability  that  they  call  for.   Our
committee is aware that these provisions may not be  adequate  and  will  in
future, in consultation with the finance committee,  consider  a  review  of
these provisions, should it become necessary to do so.

In processing clause 8  of  the  Bill,  the  issue  of  municipal  managers'
remuneration was once again raised. Our committee has repeatedly called  for
the Minister to  regulate  municipal  managers'  remuneration.  We  realise,
however, that this is easier said than done. In the first instance,  it  may
not be constitutionally tenable to do so.

Also, local government is a specific sphere  of  government  that  comprises
284 municipalities of three  categories  and  different  types,  which  also
differ  in  terms   of   population   size,   budgets,   service   delivery,
responsibilities and in other respects. We certainly need  more  information
on  what  precisely  managers  earn  and  what  exactly   their   respective
responsibilities are.

Of course, municipal managers are not appointed any longer  on  a  permanent
basis, but on employment contracts of five  years.  This  was  a  deliberate
decision  taken  by  Parliament  to  ensure  that  municipal  managers   are
productive, effective and  accountable.  The  employment  contracts  include
performance contracts, which set clear performance  targets  and  indicators
and often include bonus  payments  for  municipal  managers,  provided  they
achieve the targets set. So, it would not  be  easy  to  implement  national
regulations in these circumstances.

Of course, to attract highly skilled and efficient managers,  municipalities
often have  to  compete  with  high  private  sector  salaries.  Often,  the
municipalities most in need of highly skilled  municipal  managers  are  the
smaller and rural municipalities who can least afford  them.  Yet,  to  draw
the requisite  skills,  these  municipalities  have  to  offer  high  salary
packages in competition with the financially better-off municipalities.

Therefore, the committee is pleased to learn that the  report  on  managers'
remuneration, commissioned by the Minister,  has  been  finalised.  We  have
requested the department to present  the  findings  of  the  report  to  our
committee within eight weeks.

There were several other issues that were raised in our  processing  of  the
Bill. For example, Salga  had  suggested  that  there  are  aspects  of  the
municipal legislation that need to be reviewed. None of  the  proposals  for
review deal with the fundamental core principles  or  features  of  the  new
model of  local  government.  In  that  context,  therefore,  our  portfolio
committee welcomes such a review,  provided  it's  based  on  the  practical
experiences that municipal councillors and officials have undergone  in  the
past three years or more.

Moreover, it needs to be said that other speakers in this debate will  cover
other issues that arose in our processing of the Bill. Yet other issues  are
to be found in our report published in Monday's ATC. However, if  one  looks
at the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill, which  is  being
passed today in this House, and the Local Government:  Property  Rates  Bill
that's before our committee,  they  constitute  part  of  a  review  of  the
financial model for local government.

We've got, we believe, a wonderful, very progressive  new  system  of  local
government, but the two key areas in which we face constant challenges  are,
firstly, in the area of the need for a new financial model, and also in  the
area which is related to this, the need for greater capacity. Our  committee
has consistently held that it will take some 10 to  15  years  to  implement
the new model. Our views on the progress in that regard are set out  in  our
study tour report, which this House adopted in  the  form  of  a  resolution
several months ago.

In  conclusion,  I  want  to  express  our  appreciation  to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance for the co-operation they extended to  us.  Our  thanks
also go to Elroy Africa and the rest of the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government,  and  in  particular  Petra  Bouwer,  for  their  sterling
performance. Yet again - I hope the Deputy Minister is listening to  that  -
Petra Bouwer has been outstanding in processing the Bill. [Applause.]

We also convey appreciation to Ismail Momoniat  and  his  National  Treasury
team, and to both our Minister and Deputy Minister,  and  the  Minister  and
Deputy Minister of Finance.

Finally, the person who sent me this rude note which reads  -  and  this  is
from a senior member of this Parliament  -  and  whose  name  I  shall  keep
undisclosed for now says: ``This is  death!  Please,  spend  less  than  the
eight minutes you've been accorded.'' So, I am using 46 seconds less than  I
should to rescue this person, but  I  might  add  that  he  said  ``this  is
death'',  Barbara  Hogan,  when  your  committee  was  debating  the   Local
Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill. So, this letter  should  have
been addressed to you. Nevertheless, it's 32 seconds before time. Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]
Mnr W P DOMAN:  Adjunkvoorsitter,  die  DA  ondersteun  hierdie  wetsontwerp
omdat  die  toepassing  daarvan  'n  meer  effektiewe  regering   en   beter
finansiële  bestuur  van  munisipaliteite  behoort  mee  te  bring.  Ons  is
sensitief daarvoor dat daar nie onnodig ingemeng moet word in die  plaaslike
regeringsfeer nie, maar terselfdertyd sal munisipaliteite moet  aanvaar  dat
hulle nie kan ontsnap van die streng  finansiële  beheer  en  verantwoording
waaraan die ander sfere van regering onderworpe is nie. In  hierdie  verband
sal ons ook graag  wil  sien  dat  provinsies,  en  by  name  die  LUR'e  en
departemente van plaaslike regering,  hul  regmatige  grondwetlike  rol  van
oorsig, monitering en ondersteuning speel.

Behoorlike  prestasiebestuursooreenkomste   met   die   top   personeel   by
munisipaliteite is die een saak wat nog nie by alle  munisipaliteite  beslag
gekry het nie. Ons verwelkom dit dat  hierdie  wetsontwerp  prestasiebonusse
ook verbind aan finansiële bestuur en vereis dat  behoorlike  evaluering  na
afloop van 'n finansiële  jaar  gemaak  moet  word,  voordat  enige  bonusse
uitbetaal word. Op 10 Augustus vanjaar het City Press  berig  oor  die  byna
bankrot Maquassi Hills-munisipaliteit in die Noordwes wat meer  as  80%  van
sy begroting aan amptenare se salarisse bestee,  en  dit  sonder  dat  enige
prestasiebestuurooreenkomste in plek is. Dit is al klaar erg dat  veral  top
amptenare buitensporige salarisse ontvang, maar dan ook nie eers  gebind  is
om te  presteer  nie.  Die  toppunt  is  soos  onlangs  by  Theewaterskloof-
munisipaliteit waar die  munisipale  bestuurder  nie  presteer  het  nie  en
daarvoor vergoed word met 'n skeidingspakket van miljoene.

Hierdie wetsontwerp gaan meebring dat munisipale rade  meer  verantwoordelik
sal moet  optree.  Munisipale  rade  moet  besef  dat  as  hulle  munisipale
bestuurder   en   ander   amptenare   nie   presteer    nie,    dit    hulle
verantwoordelikheid is, want hulle het hierdie mense aangestel.

Aangesien hierdie wetsontwerp ook handel  oor  die  ingewikkelde  verhouding
van munisipale rade met munisipale  entiteite,  wat  deur  eersgenoemde  tot
stand gebring kan word, verwelkom ons dat dieselfde beginsel  geld,  naamlik
dat  munisipale  rade  verantwoordelik  bly,  of   die   entiteit   nou   'n
diensverskaffer of 'n privaatmaatskappy is. As dit vorentoe nodig blyk,  sal
strenger wetgewing moet kom oor hoe entiteite verantwoording moet doen.

Ten slotte is  die  toewysing  van  ekstra  magte  en  funksies,  hetsy  van
nasionaal of provinsiaal aan munisipaliteite, 'n teer  saak  as  die  nodige
toewysing van fondse nie ook daarmee gepaard gaan nie. Daarom verwelkom  ons
die bepaling dat behoorlike volhoubaarheidstudies gedoen moet word voor  die
toewysing van ekstra funksies of magte.

Of al die munisipaliteite oor die kapasiteit beskik om  hierdie  wetsontwerp
se bepalings uit te voer, staan sterk te betwyfel, maar ons  moet  'n  begin
maak vir strenger beheer.

Dit was lekker om 'n deel van hierdie twee komitees te wees wat  na  insette
een geluister het en deeglike oorweging aan hierdie wetgewing gegee het.  Ek
dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Deputy Chairperson, the DA supports  this  Bill  because  the
implementation thereof should bring  about  more  effective  governance  and
better financial management of municipalities. We are sensitive to the  fact
that there should not be unnecessary interference in  the  local  government
sphere, but at the same time municipalities will have to  accept  that  they
cannot escape the strict financial control and accountability to  which  the
other spheres of government are subject. In this regard we would  also  like
to see provinces,  and  specifically  the  MECs  and  departments  of  local
government,  playing  their  rightful  constitutional  role  of   oversight,
monitoring and support.

Proper performance management agreements with top  staff  at  municipalities
is the one issue which has not yet been sorted out  at  all  municipalities.
We welcome the fact  that  this  Bill  also  binds  performance  bonuses  to
financial management, and requires that adequate evaluation must take  place
at the end of a financial year before  any  bonuses  are  paid  out.  On  10
August this year City Press reported  on  the  virtually  bankrupt  Maquassi
Hills municipality in the North West which  spends  more  than  80%  of  its
budget on officials' salaries and that without  any  performance  management
agreements  being  in  place.  It  is  bad  enough  that  top  officials  in
particular receive exorbitant salaries, but  are  then  not  even  bound  to
performing. The ultimate example occurred recently  at  the  Theewaterskloof
municipality,  where  the  municipal  manager  did  not  perform   and   was
compensated for that with a severance package worth millions.

This Bill will result in municipal councils having to act more  responsibly.
Municipal councils must accept that if their  municipal  manager  and  other
officials do not perform it is their responsibility,  because  they  appoint
these people.

As this Bill also deals with the complicated relationship between  municipal
councils and municipal entities, which can be  brought  into  being  by  the
first-mentioned, we welcome  the  fact  that  the  same  principle  applies,
namely that municipal councils remain responsible, whether the entity  is  a
service provider or a private company. If it becomes  necessary  in  future,
stricter legislation will have to  be  prepared  on  how  entities  have  to
account.

In conclusion, the  allocation  of  extra  powers  and  functions,  be  they
national or provincial, to municipalities is a delicate matter if it is  not
accompanied by the necessary allocation of funds. We therefore  welcome  the
provision that proper sustainability studies  must  be  done  prior  to  the
allocation of extra functions or powers.

It is highly questionable whether all the municipalities have  the  capacity
to execute the provisions of this  Bill,  but  we  must  make  a  start  for
stricter control.

It was a pleasure to be part of  these  two  committees  which  listened  to
inputs and gave thorough consideration to this legislation. I thank you.]

Dr G G WOODS: Deputy Chairperson, I acknowledge the views of the  hon  Peter
Smith in my speech. There is a general need to review the implementation  of
the Local Government: Municipal Systems  Act  and  then  to  amend  specific
provisions  whose  execution  has  unintended  consequences  which  fail  to
adequately address the challenges of transforming local government.

The process of translating this exercise  into  further  amendments  of  the
Local Government: Municipal Systems Act is  likely  to  commence  soon.  The
Bill before us, however, does not have this intent. It does not  arise  from
a general review of the municipal system of governance or from a  particular
set  of  problems  that  have  to  be  urgently  fixed.  It  is  rather  the
legislative flip side of the Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management
Bill, whose very detailed provisions  sometimes  overlap  or  conflict  with
those of the Local Government Municipal Systems  Act,  or  which,  from  the
perspective of the  legislative  architecture  of  the  post-1994  municipal
legislation, are better located in the Local Government:  Municipal  Systems
Act.

One of the very positive decisions taken very early on and  indeed  insisted
on by the local government portfolio committee  was  that  these  amendments
should  not  be  affected  by  the  Local  Government:   Municipal   Finance
Management Bill, but rather by way of amendments to the principal Act.  From
the perspective of anyone other than a lawyer, it makes far  more  sense  to
package legislation in a manner that  is  user-friendly  than  in  a  manner
which, while technically perfectly acceptable, impedes  the  very  important
objective. After all, a law  is  written  not  only  for  lawyers,  but  for
councils, council employees, NGOs, etc.

The Bill is not contentious, or perhaps this should be rephrased:  the  Bill
is not contentious now. In the form in  which  the  committee  received  the
Bill, however,  there  were  a  number  of  provisions  that  were  patently
unconstitutional and which the IFP sought to have removed. Fortunately  this
was not too difficult, because we are not  talking  about  provisions  which
offended the IFP alone. Even  the  ruling  party  with  a  predilection  for
strengthening the national Government  at  the  expense  of  the  provinces,
recognised that something was amiss.

What the IFP finds astounding is how such provisions were  inserted  in  the
Bill in the first place and, secondly, how the state  law  advisers  managed
to certify a Bill containing such provisions.

It is worth emphasising that many of the complexities of the  legislation  -
and this applies to the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management  Bill
- are  precisely  because  the  municipal  environment  is  complex.  It  is
undoubtedly more complex a sphere than provincial governments, for  example,
and confronting us as legislators is always the challenge  of  incorporating
in our law the need to balance the complexity of  the  environment  and  the
flexibility to respond appropriately.

We  need  to  recognise  the  vastly  differing  operating  environments  of
municipalities, but by the same token, since municipalities vary so much  in
their capacity, resources, challenges and the like, one has to  be  wary  of
creating  a  smorgasbord  of  options  which  foolhardy  municipalities  may
flounder upon. In respect of the manner in which the  entities  are  defined
and permitted to function, the Bill manages to strike a reasonable  balance.
Associated with this, they are not identical as they  ally  a  challenge  of
creating a balance between a strongly regulatory and a permissive  approach.
Again, we feel a reasonable balance has been struck. In conclusion, the  IFP
supports this Bill.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, the  provisions  of  the  Bill  will  facilitate
effective  corporate  governance  systems  of   municipalities   and   would
streamline  the  execution  of  the  assigned  functions   and   powers   to
municipalities, as well as facilitate service  delivery  through  provisions
relating  to  matters  such  as  service   delivery   agreements   and   the
establishment of municipal entities.

The implementations pertaining  to  these  provisions  will  depend  on  the
extent to which they are applicable to  specific  municipalities.  The  Bill
will further allow municipalities the right to create a municipal entity  to
provide a more effective and efficient service to the public.

The New NP is very pleased with this amendment because it  will  also  limit
the involvement of officials and councillors in  the  day-to-day  management
of these external service providers, which will allow them  to  function  on
business principles.

The Bill also allows Cabinet to assign additional  functions  or  powers  to
municipalities.  This  is  a  major  step  towards  truly  developing  local
government to serve in the  needs  of  the  people.  It  further  gives  the
Minister the right to issue guidelines in order to regulate issues  such  as
a tariff structure, limits on tariff increases, incentives and penalties  to
encourage the economical, efficient and  effective  use  of  resources  when
providing services.

It tightens up the code of conduct for councillors  to  also  apply  to  the
directors of municipal entities. The New NP supports this Bill.

Ms  R  M  SOUTHGATE:  Deputy  Chairperson,  the  amendments  to  the   Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act are consequential amendments flowing  from
the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill. The nature  of  the
amendments  is  to  facilitate   the   corporate   governance   systems   of
municipalities, streamline the execution of assigned  functions  and  powers
of municipalities, and also to refine performance  contracts  and  municipal
websites.

In the assignment of a function or power to local  government  any  Minister
must, prior to tabling  that  legislation,  get  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission to assess the cost and the impact which that  function  or  power
will have on local government.  Unfunded  mandates  have  been  one  of  the
elements that negatively impacted local government  resources  and  hampered
effective service delivery.

Appropriate steps must be taken to  ensure  that  capacity  initiatives  are
implemented and that municipalities have  the  fiscal  capacity  to  perform
that function. I would support that tougher provisions must be  inserted  in
the PMFA with reference to assigning functions.

The ACDP endorses the portfolio committee's call that the Minister  and  the
department  urgently  develop  firmer  guidelines  on  the  remuneration  of
municipal managers. The ACDP supports the amendments.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chairperson, the provisions made  in  this  Bill  to
bring it in line with the Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management
Bill just debated are found by the Minority Front to be both  necessary  and
adequate.

The strengthening of  the  political  authority  of  municipal  councils  is
liberating to  local  government  independence.  The  enhancing  of  service
delivery by certain provisions would be pleasing, not only to  the  Minority
Front and to the public assurance, but to Government as a whole in terms  of
efficiency.

The Minority Front  strongly  agrees  with  the  provisions  made  to  avoid
fragmentation. Provisions, especially in terms  of  sufficient  funding  for
municipalities, would be extremely pleasing to local government  authorities
and extremely beneficial to effectiveness of municipal projects.

The Minority Fronts feels that official websites  for  municipalities  would
be  beneficial  in  terms   of   public   accessibility,   information   and
communication. Performance reports would also maintain  responsibility.  The
Minority Front supports the Local Government:  Municipal  Systems  Amendment
Bill.

Mr S A MSHUDULU: Deputy Chair, the House at large, I  would  like  to  first
confirm the ANC's determination to push back the frontiers  of  poverty  and
underdevelopment, as confirmed by our President Thabo Mbeki in his state  of
the nation address. I would also like  to  confirm  that  I  stand  here  on
behalf of the ANC in support of the Bill.

I do not want to repeat what has been said, but in my speech I  will  repeat
some of the points for emphasis. I will go directly  to  chapter  8  of  the
Local Government: Municipal Systems Act, as it was  dedicated  to  municipal
delivery. This  section  provides  for  municipalities  to  give  effect  to
constitutional obligations in terms of giving priority  to  basic  needs  of
local communities and the promotion of developmental  local  government  and
some of the services, by ensuring that they can be accessed  by  all.  These
services must be equitable and accessible. It also touches on the  provision
of  services  in  a  manner  that  is  prudent,  economical,  efficient  and
effective in  the  use  of  available  resources,  and  it  relates  to  the
improvement of standards of quality over time. Standards  must  be  reviewed
on a regular basis with a view to upgrade, extend and improve them.

Therefore, it is against this background that the amendments have  relevance
regarding the issue of municipal capacity  to  deliver  being  central.  The
House might have benefited from speakers before  me,  from  all  sides,  who
outlined the importance of these two Bills: the Local Government:  Municipal
Systems Bill, as well as the Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management
Bill, as they are premised on or aligned to the  Public  Finance  Management
Act. Without having to lecture you on the fundamentals,  I  want  to  repeat
that the Public Finance Management Act is based on  smart  principles  where
budgets have to be specific, measurable and realistic, as well as  the  fact
that targets must be achievable.

It is important, especially to the committee on local  government  after  it
has gone to the provinces, that our members here who have constituencies  in
local areas are aware of the  problems  our  municipalities  encounter.  Our
municipalities do not have capacity, and not all of them have resources.

Although there have  been  allocations,  the  biggest  problem  was  how  to
transfer or how to manage the funds that might have been allocated to  them.
I will give an example. In terms of our national budget, the composition  of
local government shares comprises transition grants,  water  and  sanitation
grants, water services projects, community-based  public  works  programmes,
grants for sports and recreation facilities,  the  national  electrification
programme, the urban transport fund, the integrated  sustainable  rural  and
development fund, a municipal infrastructure grant, a  restructuring  grant,
a financial management grant and a municipal systems improvement grant.

All these grants cannot be distributed  if  a  municipality  does  not  have
capacity. For  these  reasons,  many  municipalities  today  are  unable  to
provide municipal services to all because  of  the  infrastructural  backlog
that was also created by apartheid planning.

The overall goal is to improve the quality of services and the extension  of
services to all. When a municipality  does  not  have  capacity,  the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act does  allow  for  external  measures  that
include a municipal service partnership, for instance, an agreement  between
a municipality and a service  provider.  It  was  mentioned  by  our  Deputy
Minister that they have  to  go  through  a  feasibility  study  first  that
evaluates capacity and that identifies what has to be done.

It is also important  that  I  must  emphasise  that  the  Bill  allows  for
entities to account in terms of the Municipal Finance Management  Act.  This
will also address the question our chairperson has  raised  earlier,  namely
that there is no way that municipal  entities  can  be  established  without
having to deliver services that are relevant.

For this reason I support this Bill on behalf of the  ANC.  I  believe  that
our members will also benefit from the experience, as  well  as  the  report
that the chairperson has earlier confirmed, namely that a challenge  remains
for all of us as members of Parliament, that when we go back  home  we  have
to make sure that we are directly involved and make a contribution. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Deputy  Chair,
firstly, I would like to thank all the  members  who  participated  in  this
debate, and I would like to thank  them  all  for  their  very  constructive
contributions. The hon Gavin Woods, I thought that the whole purpose of  the
deliberations in the portfolio committees was  exactly  that  of  trying  to
come up with a very good piece of legislation. The  idea  was  to  take  the
Bill to be refined in the portfolio committee, and  to  then  come  up  with
this very good piece of legislation that we have today.

As the hon Doman was moving  away  from  the  podium  after  completing  his
speech, I heard murmuring in some ANC benches, and somebody was  whispering:
``What did we do wrong that the DA is also  supporting  this  legislation?''
[Laughter.] Thank you everybody for supporting this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                    PENSIONS SECOND (SUPPLEMENTARY) BILL

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chairperson  and  hon  members,  this  is  a
profoundly moving piece of legislation. I move  the  Bill.  Thank  you  very
much.

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance  for  consideration  and
report.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chair and hon members,  we  introduce
in the National Assembly, for the second reading, the  Government  Employees
Pension Law Amendment Bill and the Special Pensions Amendment Bill of 2003.

On 27 April 1994 seven former forces were integrated to  constitute  the  SA
National Defence Force.  In  1995  six  former  intelligence  services  were
amalgamated into  two  intelligence  services  for  the  Republic  of  South
Africa, namely the National Intelligence Agency and the SA Secret Service.

Former members of the non-statutory forces or  services  did  not  have  the
opportunity to obtain membership and to contribute to a pension  fund  prior
to the  aforementioned  integration.  Furthermore,  their  services  in  the
former non-statutory forces or services have not  been  recognised  yet  for
the provision of pension benefits. This creates  disparity  between  members
of the former statutory forces or services and former  non-statutory  forces
or services regarding the recognition of pensionable  service  for  purposes
of calculating pension benefits.

Broadly speaking, the aim of the proposed legislation  is  to  place  former
members  of  non-statutory  forces  or  services  who  are  members  of  the
Government Employees Pension Fund in a  position  similar  to  that  of  the
former statutory force or  service  members  regarding  the  recognition  of
service for pension purposes.

Deputy Chair, I would like to explain briefly the  most  salient  principles
contained in these Bills. The Government  Employees  Pension  Law  Amendment
Bill amends the Government Employees Pension Law, proclamation 21  of  1996,
and provides for a definition of ``former member of  a  non-statutory  force
or service''.

It also provides  for  the  recognition  of  services  rendered  in  a  non-
statutory force or service as pensionable  service.  Such  recognition  will
result in an increase in pension benefits payable  to  former  non-statutory
force or service members, or their  beneficiaries  when  such  a  member  or
pensioner is deceased.

The  Bill  also  provides  that  the  benefits  payable,  in  terms  of  the
Government Employees Pension Law, will be reduced  in  accordance  with  the
rules of the fund where a former member of a non-statutory force or  service
receives or has received in his or her own right a benefit in terms  of  the
Special Pensions  Act.  This  provision  applies  where  the  member's  non-
statutory service is recognised as pensionable service.

The Special Pensions Amendment Bill amends  the  Special  Pensions  Act  and
provides that a person's  right  to  a  pension  in  terms  of  the  Special
Pensions Act ceases  when  that  person's  non-statutory  force  service  is
recognised as pensionable service  in  terms  of  the  Government  Employees
Pension Law. It also confirms that a dependent of a person whose service  in
a non-statutory force or service is recognised as pensionable  service,  may
continue to receive a special pension in his or her own right.

In tabling the Bills before this House for  consideration,  we  owe  special
thanks to the Chair of the Portfolio Committee on Finance for her  excellent
adjudication of the debate in the committee,  and  to  the  members  of  the
committee for their constructive contributions. We are confident that  these
Bills represent  the  Government's  commitment  to  a  process  of  ensuring
equality and redressing the discriminatory practices of the past. Thank  you
very much, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

Mr N  M  NENE:  Mr  Chairperson,  hon  members,  for  the  majority  of  our
combatants and former members of the liberation armies,  this  is  indeed  a
groundbreaking piece of legislation even though, when these  movements  were
formed, none of  these  liberation  fighters  joined  for  any  material  or
financial gain. They only joined for the liberation of this country  and  to
bring about a democratic and nonsexist society. The  so-called  former  non-
statutory forces are none  other  than  the  very  organisations  that  made
possible the democracy that we are all proud of today.

The 1994 miracle would not have been possible without  the  contribution  of
these non-statutory forces. A number of attempts have been made by  the  ANC
Government to recognise the contribution of these non-statutory forces.

A number of efforts, as I have indicated,  have  been  about  them,  but  no
amount of financial reward would ever be sufficient to honour this  kind  of
contribution. This Bill seeks to redress a very critical part of the  former
members of the non-statutory forces' integration into the statutory  forces,
particularly the SANDF, the SAPS, and the National Intelligence Agency.

The amendment to the Government Employees Pension Law of 1996  provides  for
the recognition of service that these cadres rendered  selflessly  in  these
non-statutory liberation forces. Some  of  these  comrades  even  laid  down
their lives for this cause, and some of them disappeared, never to  be  seen
again.

This Bill is a further demonstration of the  ANC's  commitment  to  equality
and justice for all. The members  of  the  previous  statutory  forces  were
members of the pension fund, and when they  were  integrated  into  the  new
dispensation, their service to the previous order was recognised.

This Bill creates an enabling legislative framework  that  would  allow  for
subsequent processes to take place in order to address the  plight  of  many
of our  liberation  fighters.  One  of  these  processes  has  already  been
outlined by the Deputy Minister in his speech.

For members to benefit from this arrangement, certain details  needs  to  be
clarified in this House namely that an amount of R1,5 billion was set  aside
from the Government Employees Pension  Fund  during  1998  and  approved  by
Cabinet, that in any pension fund both the employer and  the  employee  must
make contributions towards the fund, and that the period for which a  member
has contributed needs to be taken into account.

In order to address these issues this Bill, through a  number  of  measures,
does the following: members are  grouped  into  categories  that  take  into
account the length of time that they served in their liberation forces,  and
I wouldn't want to bore you with those  categories.  Actuarial  calculations
have established the  value  of  both  the  employer's  and  the  employees'
contributions and an appropriate  apportionment  has  been  worked  out.  An
amicable mechanism  has  also  been  devised  to  accommodate  the  members'
contributions without financially prejudicing the former members of the non-
statutory forces,  as  they  did  not  contribute  in  the  past.  Extensive
deliberations took place in  the  Public  Service  Co-ordinating  Bargaining
Council, culminating in resolution 7/98 that provides for matters that  this
Bill seeks to achieve.
In order to qualify, the former members of the non-statutory forces need  to
meet certain requirements. I'll mention only two of those requirements.  The
first one is that  former  members'  names  must  appear  on  the  Certified
Personnel Register as  contemplated  in  the  interim  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa, section 224(2)(c) or the personnel list, which  is
defined in section 1 of the Intelligence Services Act of  2002.  The  former
member also must have been part of the integration  process  in  the  SANDF,
SAPS or the National Intelligence Agency.

The other category is that of people who have been paid  benefits  owing  to
them by the fund upon cessation of  their  membership  that  may  have  been
entitled to additional benefits. This amendment further directs  that  their
service in the non-statutory force or service be taken into account.

The ANC-led Government  recognises  that  the  measures  taken  may  not  be
completely adequate to address disparities and inequities that were  imposed
upon us by the apartheid regime over the years. This  piece  of  legislation
is but one of those many attempts that are undertaken  under  all  sorts  of
constraints. At times, we do not realise the magnitude  of  the  problem  of
inequality facing us and how deep-rooted it is.

I am reminded  of  a  lengthy  quote  by  an  American  philosopher,  Ronald
Arenson, in 1991, who wrote as follows:


  ``The American lesson is a painful but simple one,  because  we  have  to
  make the universal rights available to  everybody  regardless  of  class,
  race or national origin. The  heritage  racial  domination  continues  to
  perpetuate itself ...  Without  vigorous  political  action  on  national
  level, without social transformation stretching far  beyond  `affirmative
  and equal opportunity', South Africa's black majority will follow in  the
  pattern of America's black minority, reproducing  itself  `spontaneously'
  in a hereditary poverty.'"

This was and still is  a  clear  indication  that  we  compare  with  mature
democracies, but our solutions are different, as we do not  want  to  follow
the route that this philosopher warned us about.

The last part of this Bill deals  with  a  cross-reference  to  the  Special
Pensions Act, and therefore necessitates a consequential  amendment  to  the
Special Pensions Act.  This  refers  to  those  members  who  are  currently
receiving benefits under the Special Pensions  Act,  and  that  the  benefit
payable to them will be reduced in accordance with the  rules.  Indeed,  the
tide is turning, and the ANC will continue championing  this  worthy  cause.
The ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Deputy Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister of  Finance,
Deputy Minister of Defence and hon members, the two  amending  Bills  before
the House concern the recognition, by way of pensions, for service  in  non-
statutory forces and  other  related  services,  such  as  intelligence  and
security.

There is no more honourable a gesture in any country than for  a  government
to honour, materially, those soldiers,  combatants  and  others  who  served
their country for the cause in which they believed.

The main role-players referred to in these Bills are  the  ex-combatants  of
the non-statutory forces, but please, allow me to refresh your memory as  to
who is a veteran, as defined in the Military Veterans' Affairs Act of  1999.
It says ``a military veteran is any person who served in the  Union  Defence
Force, the SA Defence Force, the SA National  Defence  Force  and  any  non-
statutory force, as defined in the Demobilisation Act.''

This gesture of the  Government  will  also  be  appreciated  by  the  World
Veterans Federation, which will be holding its 24th general assembly of  the
federation in South  Africa  during  December  of  this  year.  Seventy-four
countries are affiliated to the federation,  representing  over  30  million
veterans.

The credo of this federation is worth mentioning. It  talks  about  veterans
and says:


  No one can speak more adequately for peace than those who fought in  war.
  The voices of war veterans are a reflection of the language for peace  of
  people the world over. Humanity has earned the right  to  peace.  Without
  it, there can be no hope for the future, and without hope, man is lost.

Ex-soldiers or combatants are often forgotten  when  conflicts  come  to  an
end. Forgotten are the risks that they took,  forgotten  are  the  hardships
that they had to endure, forgotten are the periods they were separated  from
their loved ones. When they return, they are faced with the reality  of  not
having an income, having problems of reintegrating  into  their  communities
and having severe problems of providing for their families.

The only worrying aspect is the fact that provision  for  pensions  is  only
made for the one side, and not for the other side who also suffered  because
they were conscripted or volunteered, and  did  extensive  national  service
and did not have the opportunity to contribute to a pension fund. The  worst
hit are the black and coloured soldiers who served in the SA Defence  Force.
Hopefully, their service will also be recognised in time to come.

The DA supports these two Bills, as they enhance the  effectiveness  of  the
Acts that are being amended to the advantage of the veterans. We must  never
forget our old soldiers and combatants, no matter  which  side  they  fought
on. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Deputy Chairperson, the IFP  supported  the  Special  Pensions
Act and the Government Employees Pension Laws when these were introduced  in
1996. Therefore, we can have no issues or problems with  the  amendments  of
these two pieces of legislation that  are  before  us  today,  in  that  the
amendments are consistent with and, in fact, further the original  aims  and
intentions of the 1996 Acts.

We are, therefore, pleased to support both amendments. Thank you.

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  DEFENCE:  Thank  you,  members.  Four  minutes  go
quickly.

Deputy Chairperson and hon members, today marks  an  important  landmark  in
the evolution of our young democracy. The documents before us  that  require
passage through this House reflect the attainment of yet another chapter  in
our drive to redress and make restitution  for  our  apartheid  legacy.  Our
first democratic Government decided on the need to  rectify  unequal  labour
practices in the public service that we  had  inherited.  This  ratification
required a number of legislative and other changes that  we  have  witnessed
over the years since 1994.

The first major milestone was when  we  achieved  restitution,  through  the
granting of equal pension benefits for all  women  employed  in  the  Public
Service. As hon member Nene has already pointed out,  Cabinet  set  aside  a
further R1,5 billion to enable progress to be made towards the promotion  of
equal labour practice for all the citizens of South Africa.

An amount of R140 million was utilised to eradicate  discriminatory  pension
practices for the former general  assistants  of  the  Department  of  Water
Affairs. Other joint projects have involved  redressing  the  position  with
regard to temporary members of the general assistance cadre. Further  action
is aimed at  addressing  the  needs  of  dismissed  Eastern  Cape  strikers.
Respectively, the amounts  in  the  two  categories  referred  to  are  R319
million and R129 million.

When we created our new SA National Defence Force which serves us nobly,  we
established  and  implemented  the  constitutional   principle   of   proper
recognition of service for all integrating forces.

Today, we speak of our new National defence force with pride, and it is  not
only us, but also all our partners in South Africa, in  Mozambique,  in  the
DRC, in Burundi, in Ethiopia, on the high seas and above in the blue of  our
skies who do so. We have created this proud achievement through giving  full
recognition for service in the SADF and for service in the TBVC states.
We have also  followed  a  steady  programme  towards  full  and  equivalent
recognition for service in uMkhonto weSizwe and Apla. These Bills  allow  us
to complete a long, long process that has  been  thoroughly  canvassed  with
all the stakeholders in the  House.  This  lengthy  process  that  has  been
followed since 1994 has culminated in these law-changing proposals.

Pensions are in recognition of service  for  soldiers  and  former  soldiers
that have served  in  the  military.  They  should  not  be  regarded  as  a
privilege, but as a right or entitlement. In South Africa, all soldiers  who
served  in  the  SA  Defence  Force  receive  a  pension.  This  pension  is
calculated and based on the number of years served in the military.

The issue of parity of pensions  between  the  statutory  and  non-statutory
force soldiers is a very important political issue, and it  is  crucial  for
the stability of this country  that  members  of  the  Defence  Force,  from
whatever formations they originated, are treated equally.
It should be noted that an estimated 2 000 people covered in these Bills  as
persons who have  served  in  the  non-statutory  force  are  serving  other
Government  departments,  including  the   SA   Police   Service,   National
Intelligence Agency, Correctional Services and others.

Once these laws are amended, those who at present receive  special  pensions
benefits and who will qualify for the restructuring of pensions,  will  have
to have their pensions amended, taking into account the  amounts  that  they
have received.

The Department of Defence is also considering  submissions  made  to  it  by
parties who state that the special pensions  mechanisms  have  shortcomings.
In this regard, those who do not  qualify  for  special  pensions  benefits,
because they were less than thirty-five years old on  the  qualifying  date,
need also to be looked at.

The Bill, as amended, ensures that  dependants  receiving  special  pensions
benefit in their own  right,  are  not  penalised.  We  are  also  aware  of
inaccuracies in the existing certified personnel register,  the  CPR,  which
serves as the basis of identifying persons  to  benefit  from  measures  put
forward to this House  today.  At  the  correct  time,  the  Ministry  shall
address any shortcomings identified  on  the  CPR  and,  obviously,  correct
where necessary.

I've alluded to a steady programme, hon  member  Schalkwyk,  that  has  been
followed by the Department  of  Defence,  in  ensuring  the  recognition  of
service of all integrating forces. Members of the House may not be  familiar
with the details of this programme.

Using the conditions of recognition of services of  the  former  SADF  as  a
basis, the department went through an intensive programme of  ensuring  that
the former TBVC soldiers were not unfairly discriminated  against  regarding
their pensions. We are pleased to report that the department has a plan  for
providing post-retirement medical service benefits.

Training programmes have now been standardised with  bridging  training  all
but over. The quality of opportunities  that  the  NSF  provided  for  women
soldiers is now provided by the department for all  Defence  Force  members,
irrespective of their background.

Given this context, we know that it has taken an  inordinately  long  period
for us to reach this particular point. A number of heroes  of  the  struggle
have passed on without enjoying full and proper  pension  benefits  for  the
years of service they have given to our  nation,  without  full  recognition
for the sacrifices and extreme hardships that  they  endured  in  conducting
the struggle for our freedom.

Some of our elder comrades are experiencing economic hardships as  a  result
of being too old to work. Others who have taken  packages  have  started  to
lose hope that the country they fought for will recognise  their  sacrifices
and compensate them accordingly. Some of our retired members  are  seriously
ill, while others have died without due compensation.

I wish to repeat here that there are  those  members  of  the  Rivonia  High
Command, including the late Comrade Govan Mbeki, Tata Sisulu, Comrade  Elias
Motswaledi and others, who did not live long enough to  see  us  carry  this
process through to its required conclusion.

We ask that the dependants of these  comrades  should  understand  that  our
tardiness has largely been as a result of the  bureaucratic  minefield  that
we have had to cross. We beg  their  understanding  and  tolerance,  and  we
commit ourselves to preventing any further delay in their  receiving  proper
restitution.

The heroes of our struggle, whom we are still lucky to  have  with  us,  are
scattered throughout our nation. We would like to appeal to the  members  of
this House to assist in providing proper  care  to  these  veterans.  As  we
enjoy the fruits of our democracy,  let  us,  in  equal  measure,  show  our
gratitude and appreciation to those who  made  this  democracy  possible  by
assisting, where possible, in their wellbeing.

Whilst the Military Health Services have  a  national  presence,  there  are
important gaps in our coverage. We'd like to appeal to  the  Departments  of
Health and Social Development to assist these comrades in  areas  we  cannot
reach. We wish to give our full support to these long-overdue Bills.

Ngesikhathi  esekhona  lapha  uSekekela  Mongameli,   uMsholozi,   bengifisa
ukumtshela  ngithi,  ``Nxamalala,  usungalala  ubuthongo  ngoba  lo  mthetho
uzokwenza  ukuthi  sikwazi  ukukhokhela  amadelakufa   angoJenene   Dlamini,
oTekere  noMasondo  izimpesheni  zabo  ezibafanele''.  Siyazi  ukuthi  lapho
bekhona baphila impilo enzima  ngenxa  yokuthi  bebelinde  ukuthi  zikhokhwe
lezi zimpesheni zabo.

Siyabonga-ke kwiPhalamende nakuHulumeni ukuthi sesikwazile namhlanje  ukuthi
siphasise lo mthetho ozokwenza ukuthi lezi  zimali  zikhokhelwe  amadelakufa
akithi  ayilwela  le  nkululeko  esiyithokozelayo   namhlanje.   Ngiyabonga.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[Whilst Msholozi, the Deputy President, is still here, I would like  to  say
to him, ``Nxamalala, [clan name for the Zuma  surname]  you  may  now  enjoy
your sleep  because  this  piece  of  legislation  will  enable  us  to  pay
stalwarts such as General Dlamini, Tekere and Masondo the  pensions  due  to
them.'' We know that where they are life is hard,  because  they  have  long
been waiting for these pension benefits to be paid out.

We thank Parliament and the Government that today we have  managed  to  pass
this Bill which will make possible the payment of our stalwarts  who  fought
for the freedom that we enjoy today. [Applause.]]

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Mr Deputy Chairman, the Government  Employees  Pension  Law
Amendment Bill seeks to provide for the recognition of services rendered  by
members of non-statutory forces or services, and to rule  on  the  financing
of this decision.

Die ander wetsontwerp, die Wetsontwerp op Spesiale Pensioene, handel oor  'n
pensioenskema wat daargestel is vir lede van buite die vorige  statutêre  en
nie-statutêre magte. Die agb Adjunkminister van Finansies het gesê  daar  is
lede van sewe magte wat hierby geïnkorporeer word. Die  Nuwe  NP  ondersteun
hierdie bepalings. Dit is net reg dat oudsoldate, of hulle nou  teen  mekaar
geveg het of nie, en wat geveg het vir 'n saak waarin hulle glo, se  bydraes
tot die vrede wat ons vandag in Suid-Afrika het, erken sal word.

Daar is egter 'n probleem, en  ek  wil  graag  die  agb  Adjunkminister  van
Verdediging daarop wys dat daar sekere lede van die Weermag is wat nie  deur
hierdie wetsontwerp bevoordeel word nie, maar wat eintlik daardeur  benadeel
word.  Dit  is  die  sogenaamde  gedemobiliseerde  magte   wat   voor   1994
gedemobiliseer is. Dit is hoofsaaklik magte wat  op  kontrakbasis  in  diens
geneem is en met 'n vergoedingspakket gedemobiliseer is. Sommige  van  hulle
was lede van die Suid-Afrikaanse Kaapse Korps, SAKK  soos  ons  hulle  geken
het, en daar is ook nog ander van hulle.
Hierdie lede van vroeëre magte kry geen voordeel uit  hierdie  pensioenskema
nie. Hulle moet tevrede wees met hulle miserabele skeidingspakket  wat  voor
1994 aan hulle betaal is. Daarmee moet hulle 'n bestaan  voer,  terwyl  lede
van die nie-statutêre magte, dit wil sê van Apla,  MK  ensovoorts,  wat  ook
voor 1994 gedemobiliseer is, wel die voordele van hierdie pensioen ontvang.

Onses insiens is dit  diskriminasie.  Ons  sal  hierna  moet  kyk.  Die  agb
Minister van Finansies is so gou  om  daarna  te  verwys  dat  hierdie  lede
waarna ek nou verwys het, nie vryheidsvegters was nie, maar hulle  was  deel
van 'n oorlog. Hulle was in 'n oorlog betrokke, en alhoewel  hulle  aan  die
ander kant geveg het, is die punt dat die twee magte wat teen mekaar in  die
oorlog te staan gekom het, besluit het om vrede te maak in  Suid-Afrika,  en
daar sit ons vandag met 'n demokratiese Suid-Afrika. Ons dink almal moet  in
hierdie saak bevoordeel word, want hierdie stryders wat misken word was  ook
stryders wat Sowjet-ekspansionisme teengestaan het.  Om  watter  rede  hulle
ookal aan die oorlog deelgeneem het, dit maak nie saak nie. Die punt is  dat
daar nog sekere lede is wat nie geken word in die saak nie.

Die Nuwe NP sal aanhou met onderhandelinge en ander aksies, en sal  ook  met
privaatledewetgewing na die Parlement kom om hierdie onbillike situasie  aan
te spreek, maar vir vandag steun  ons  die  wetsontwerp  wat  voor  ons  is.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The other Bill, the Special Pensions Amendment Bill, deals with  a  pension
scheme that has been established for members  from  outside  of  the  former
statutory and non-statutory forces. The hon Deputy Minister of  Finance  has
said that there are members of seven forces  who  will  be  incorporated  in
this. The New NP supports these  provisions.  It  is  only  right  that  ex-
soldiers, whether they fought each other or not, and who fought for a  cause
they believed in, be acknowledged for the contributions  they  made  to  the
peace that we experience in South Africa today.

However, there is a problem, and I would  like  to  point  out  to  the  hon
Deputy Minister of Defence that there are certain  members  of  the  Defence
Force who do not  benefit  from  this  Bill,  but  who  are  actually  being
prejudiced by it. These are  the  so-called  demobilised  forces  that  were
demobilised before 1994. They are mainly  forces  who  were  employed  on  a
contract basis and were demobilised with a  compensatory  package.  Some  of
them were members of the South African  Coloured  Corps,  SACC  as  we  knew
them, and there were others as well.

These members of former forces do  not  stand  to  gain  from  this  pension
scheme. They have to be satisfied with their  miserable  severance  packages
which were paid to them before 1994. They have to make a living  with  that,
while members of non-statutory forces, in other words  Apla,  MK,  etc,  who
were also demobilised before 1994, will be receiving the  benefits  of  this
pension.

To our mind that is discrimination. We will have to look at  this.  The  hon
Minister of Finance is quick to say that these members to whom I  have  just
referred were not freedom fighters, but they were part of a war.  They  were
involved in a war, and although they fought on the other side, the point  is
that the two forces opposed in war decided to make peace  in  South  Africa,
and so we have a democratic South Africa today.  We  believe  that  everyone
should benefit in this matter, because these  fighting  men  who  are  being
disregarded were fighters against Soviet expansionism. Whatever  the  reason
they participated in the war, it does not matter. The point  is  that  there
are still some members who have not been consulted in the process.

The New NP will continue with negotiations and other actions, and will  also
bring private members' legislation to Parliament in order  to  address  this
unfair situation, but for  today  we  support  the  Bill  in  front  of  us.
[Applause.]]

Mnr A BLAAS: Voorsitter, die oogmerke van  hierdie  wysigings  is  duidelik.
Die wysigings was noodsaaklik sodat die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Nasionale  Weermag
met sy rasionaliseringsprogram kan voortgaan.
Van die belangrikste redes hiervoor is: Eerstens, die personeeluitgawes  van
die Weermag is  buite  verhouding  hoog.  Tweedens,  die  Weermag  is  reeds
onderbefonds. Derdens, die ouderdom vir rangverhouding  in  die  Weermag  is
nie  reg  nie.   Vierdens,   die   lede   voldoen   nie   aan   die   nodige
fiksheidvereistes om hulle take effektief uit  te  voer  nie.  En  laastens,
lede van die statutêre magte  het  nie  die  geleentheid  gehad  om  tot  'n
pensioenfonds by te dra nie.

Die wysigings  aan  beide  die  wette  maak  dit  moontlik  om  'n  redelike
uittreemeganisme  vir  Weermagslede  daar  te  stel,  sodat  daar  met   die
rasionaliseringsprogram van die Weermag voortgegaan kan word. Beide  hierdie
wysigings word deur die ACDP ondersteun. Ek dink ook dat daar in 'n  stadium
net gekyk moet word na die klein komponent van Weermagslede wat nog  nie  in
aanmerking  kom  vir  pensioen  nie.  Dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation   of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Chairman, the objectives of these  amendments  are  clear.  The
amendments were necessary so that the South Afican  National  Defence  Force
can continue with its rationalisation programme.

Some of the most  important  reasons  for  this  were:  Firstly,  the  staff
expenses of the Defence Force are  disproportionately  high.  Secondly,  the
Defence Force is already underfunded. Thirdly, the age-to-rank  relation  in
the Defence Force is not right. Fourthly, the members  do  not  comply  with
the necessary fitness requirements to execute their tasks  effectively.  And
lastly, members of the statutory forces did  not  have  the  opportunity  to
contribute to a pension fund.

The amendments to both these acts allow for the  implementation  of  a  fair
retiring mechanism for Defence Force members, so  that  the  rationalisation
programme of the Defence Force  can  continue.  Both  these  amendments  are
supported by the ACDP. I think that at some stage, the  small  component  of
Defence Force members who, as yet, do not qualify for  a  pension,  must  be
looked at. [Applause.]]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the Pan Africanist Congress of  Azania  supports
this Bill.

We record our appreciation for what this Government has done to  respond  to
the  plight  of  many  freedom  fighters  who  served  this  country   under
conditions that were very difficult, and even  inhuman,  in  an  attempt  to
bring  about  democracy  which  will  be  enjoyed  by  all  South  Africans,
irrespective of their colour or creed.

Unfortunately, as one form of disparity is  addressed,  it  sheds  light  on
many small pockets of discrimination in the integration process. If  service
in the non-statutory forces is accepted by the country and Government,  then
pensions received by  persons  who  served  in  these  non-statutory  forces
should be accordingly adjusted to bring parity in pensions paid. We are  one
country with one Defence Force and, therefore, the benefits we offer  should
reflect that oneness.

There are, however, many desperate cases which reach our offices  of  people
who have been left out for one reason or another. We hope we can reach  them
one day. Thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, regarding the integration of military  forces
into the SA National Defence Force, the MF found it acceptable that  payment
of pensions be made  to  those  in  the  service  who  had  honourably  made
sacrifices in the public interest.

However, noting that provision does not exist regarding  these  members  who
served in non-statutory forces prior to integration and who were  unable  to
contribute to a pension fund, the MF feels that they are  entitled  to  such
special pension and therefore has no objection  to  this  Bill  which  makes
provision to allow for this process.

Provisions made in terms of pensions of  the  Government  Employees  Pension
Fund are adequate. Further, the clarity provided in the light of  rights  of
a dependent of a former recipient of such pension is in line too.

The terms provided for financing and management of resolution of issues  are
supported by the MF. It is hoped that these adjustments will be pleasing  to
those involved.

The MF feels that the Government's hard work in  correcting  the  injustices
of the past has proven to be  a  success.  Our  most  important  task  as  a
Government is to our people. The MF supports both the Bills. Thank you.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chair, hon members, I would  like  to
thank all members who have participated in this debate. Quite  clearly,  the
legislation is widely supported by members.

The hon Schalkwyk raised a particular issue that relates to a contingent  of
soldiers who served in  the  previous  dispensation.  I  have  had  occasion
before to say to the hon Schalkwyk that the process we are dealing with  is,
to us, a  separate  process  from  the  issues  that  he  has  been  raising
consistently. I have advised that he seek the proper channels to raise  that
particular issue. I want to repeat today that it is important  for  the  hon
member to find the correct channels.

If I heard the Deputy Minister of Defence correctly when  she  was  speaking
here, she did identify some of the weaknesses that still exist which the  SA
National Defence Force is in the process of dealing with. So, I  think  that
it is important for members to try to link up to those processes.

I think it is also important to point out to the hon Odendaal -  although  I
was battling with the hearing device when he was speaking - that  before  we
rush into saying that this is discrimination, it is important to  understand
what this process has been all about.

This has been a process in which the former statutory forces and the  former
non-statutory forces came together to  create  a  defence  force  out  of  a
number of forces that were there. Of course, what the  non-statutory  forces
will bring to the table will be those matters that  affect  members  of  the
former non-statutory forces. You then expect  that  the  other  forces  will
also bring to the table matters  that  may  affect  former  members  of  the
statutory forces.

I do not know if that has happened, but in our case we have put this  matter
consistently. It has taken us time to get to  the  point  at  which  we  are
today, and at which we are able, through this  legislation,  to  redress  an
imbalance that has been in the system.  So,  don't  lose  hope,  don't  lose
patience, find the correct channels, raise the issues  and  see  if  we  can
deal with them.

The hon Mogoba also raised the issue of people who may have been  left  out,
but was not very specific as to how people got left out. Because the  Deputy
Minister of Defence did say, for example, that  there  are  deficiencies  on
the CPR list, I would think that perhaps some of those people may have  been
left out precisely because they did not make it onto the CPR list. Again,  I
think this is a matter that needs to  be  taken  up  with  the  Ministry  of
Defence and with the SA National Defence Force so  that  we  can  deal  with
those particular cases.
I would like to thank members for their support  and  participation  in  the
debate. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

                       POSTAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Hon Chairperson, members, we are  presenting
this Bill today  just  a  few  weeks  before  World  Postal  Day,  which  is
celebrated each year on  9  October.  This  international  event  marks  the
anniversary of the formation of the Universal Postal Union in  1894  in  the
Swiss capital of Bern. On this day, the world  community  assesses  the  new
conditions under which postal services are delivered to meet  the  universal
access mandate. As part of this world community, we  should  gear  ourselves
to make a mark by doing what is relevant to  our  own  local  conditions  in
meeting this mandate.

In our country where millions of our  people,  especially  the  historically
disadvantaged,  still  depend  on  the  postal  service  to   interact   and
communicate, the centrality of SAPO cannot be underestimated or  undermined.
Thus the challenge the postal administration faces becomes a  real  national
issue and requires that it be treated as such.

In line with the Universal Postal Union's theme for this year's  anniversary
celebration, which is  ``think  globally  and  act  locally'',  we  have  to
approach the  postal  services  sector  accordingly.  Our  local  conditions
dictate that we pursue the fulfilment  of  the  universal  service  mandate,
though  international  trends  may  indicate  otherwise.  For  us  as  South
Africans, this is an overriding imperative.

It was against this backdrop that, as early as 1997, a  new  policy  process
was initiated for the provision of a universal service.  This  policy  found
concrete expression in the  Postal  Services  Act,  Act  124  of  1998.  The
legislative framework has made  it  possible  for  the  South  African  Post
Office to increase its service levels and to embrace  technology  in  a  way
that delivers services. Crime levels at SAPO have been  reduced,  which  has
resulted in higher staff morale.

The Rural Postal Strategy is now being  implemented  through  the  citizens'
post offices, providing  postal  infrastructure  to  multipurpose  community
centres in partnership with the GCIS.  Co-operative  business  services  are
slowly  increasing,  and  we  are  working   with   the   Direct   Marketing
Association, which is now the Marketing Federation of South Africa, and  the
National Postal Forum in  discussing  future  postal  strategies  that  will
improve efficiencies of business. Consequently, the regulator has  developed
and is continuing to develop regulations  and  a  monitoring  framework  for
service delivery.
This Bill will not only encourage competition  in  the  postal  sector,  but
will  actually  clarify  the  regulatory  framework  for  the  delivery   of
universal service. Government would like to  fulfil  the  universal  service
obligations,  while  at  the  same  time  encouraging  competition  in  this
industry. It is through competition that we will lower  prices  and  improve
service  delivery  levels.  Therefore,  this  Bill  will  also  clarify  the
competition landscape for the sector and  will  provide  continuity  in  the
sector, as well as allow for all operators to focus on  harmonious  business
in this industry.

In line with this policy of fulfilling the universal  service  mandate,  the
licence that was granted with a clear obligation was to ensure all  citizens
of our country have access to a basic letter service.  This  service  should
be reasonably accessible irrespective of physical location. It should  apply
uniform postage rates at  an  affordable  price  and  should  also  offer  a
reliable service. To facilitate an environment for SAPO to  accomplish  this
monumental task, the institution  was  given  a  period  of  exclusivity  to
provide service up to 1kg. This provision is  renewable  every  three  years
and, during this period of exclusivity, no other  postal  operator  will  be
authorised to operate in the reserved area.

If SAPO is to meet its obligation to the benefit of millions of our  people,
this exclusivity has currently to be retained. This is because we do  things
globally and act locally, till conditions  change  or  universal  access  is
achieved. The introduction of this Bill is aimed at doing exactly that.  The
repeal of the said section will protect the exclusivity in  respect  of  the
reserved postal services,  but  will  also  eliminate  the  multiplicity  of
interpretations emanating from this section.

I would like  to  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Communications and all members of the committee for  having  processed  this
Bill. A special word of thanks goes to my director-general and the  DDG  for
co-ordinating the process successfully. I request this House to accept  this
Bill. [Applause.]
Mr M A MAZIYA: Deputy Chair, hon Minister and hon members, I am happy to  be
one of the members who are participating in this debate. Minister, the  Bill
comes in to close the loopholes in the Act, to ensure that the Post  Office,
in implementing universal services, does not  get  involved  in  unnecessary
court battles. The law also assists in  ensuring  that  those  who  want  to
participate as postal service providers should get involved in other  fields
of postal services.

Minister, this is an indication  of  the  ANC's  commitment  to  ensuring  a
better life for  all  as  enshrined  in  the  Freedom  Charter.  We  do  not
apologise for this position of a better life for all.

It is our view in the ANC that this privilege will help the Post  Office  in
pursuing this interest.

Malungu  ahloniphekile,  iyamangalisa   impela   indlela   amanye   amaqembu
akhohlisa ngayo abantu. Uma engaphandle kwaleli  Phalamende,  azenza  abantu
abanozwelo, kodwa uma elapha ePhalamende  aphikisana  nayo  yonke  imiThetho
okuqondwe ngayo ukwenza ngcono impilo yabo bonke abantu.  Emavikini  amabili
edlule babevakashele elinye lamalokishi  lapho  bazibophezela  khona  ukuthi
bazolwela  ukugunyazwa  kwabantu  abamnyama.  Kodwa,  emuva  kwezinsuku  nje
ezimbili  sekudingidwa   isichibiyelo   somThetho   omayelana   nokugunyazwa
kwabamnyama kwezomnotho, lona  lelo  qembu  laphikisana  nalesi  sichibiyelo
laze lathi makuvotwe.

Namhlanje  ngeke  kusimangaze  uma  bengaphika  bathi  akuvotwe  ngoba  vele
abahambisani  nemithetho  okuqondwe  ngayo  ukulungisa  ngokushesha  indlela
esinikezwa ngayo izinsiza. Abantu abakhe  emaphandleni  bayoyithola  kanzima
imali ethunyelwa kubo uma indlela  yokuhambiswa  kwamaposi  ihamba  kancane,
ngoba kungekho  indlela  iposihhovisi  elikwazi  ngayo  ukuthi  lenze  imali
ukuhambisa leyo misebenzi.

Kungumbono wethu ukuthi  uHulumeni  oholwa  uKhongolose  uzinikele  ngempela
ekwenzeni ngcono impilo yabo bonke abantu, ukuthi lo  mThetho  uqhutshekiswe
uye phambili. Kungakho-ke sisisekela lesi sichibiyelo. (Translation of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Hon members, it is amazing how some parties deceive  people.  Outside  this
Parliament they pretend to be caring, but when they  are  here  they  oppose
all the laws meant to improve the lives of all the people.

Two weeks ago they visited one township where they committed  themselves  to
fighting for the  empowerment  of  black  people.  However,  only  two  days
thereafter the amendment to the  Act  regarding  the  empowerment  of  black
people is made, and the same party  opposes  it  to  the  extent  that  they
demand voting.

Even today we will not be surprised if they  demand  voting  again  because,
naturally, they do not approve of any laws which target speedy  improvements
to our service delivery. People in  rural  areas  will  have  difficulty  in
receiving money sent to them if postal services are slow  and  if  the  Post
Office has no way of gaining funds to operate those services.

Our suggestion is that the ANC-led Government dedicate itself  to  improving
life for all so that this law can be processed. That is why we support  this
amendment. ]

We say to those who oppose that we know this is their attitude  to  all  the
laws that come before this  House,  and  to  the  laws  that  are  aimed  at
improving the lives of our people and at ensuring that  there  is  normality
and balance in the way we live. Amandla! [Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Hon Deputy Chair,  the  Postal  Services  Amendment  Bill  does
nothing more than entrench the monopoly of the Post Office to the  detriment
of the courier companies. What this sector needs is  competition,  not  more
protection.

When the underlying Act was passed in 1998, the Minister  of  Communications
stated, ``Competition should be encouraged by the Government.''  Instead  of
taking this sector forward along the stated path of competition,  this  Bill
seeks to take us back a number of steps.

What the department and the ANC would like us to believe is that,  in  order
to bring the Postal Services Act in line  with  the  Appeal  Court  decision
earlier this year, and  to  ensure  universal  access  to  postal  services,
courier companies must be excluded entirely from operating in  the  reserved
area of less than 1kg. The ANC's argument is flawed on two accounts.

Firstly, the minority judgments in the Appeal Court pronounced that:


  ... the legislature recognised that couriers  were  illegally  performing
  reserved postal services and intended to allow them to do so  legally  in
  the future, providing certain undertakings were given.

In other words, the minority judgments in the Appeal  Court  held  that  the
legislation did intend to  preserve  a  monopoly,  albeit  while  permitting
courier services within the activities of reserved postal services.

Therefore the underlying problem was the  interpretation  of  the  Act.  All
that was needed was to amend the Act. What has, in fact,  happened  is  that
the department is using this interpretation to change the  law  to  entrench
the monopoly. If the Act is not clear, then make it  clear.  Do  not  change
it, its intent or its meaning.

This course of action of making law clearer has  precedent  in  this  House.
Parliament is about to do the same thing  with  the  Prevention  of  Illegal
Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land  Act  after  the  same  Appeal
Court interpreted it to mean that landlords cannot  evict  tenants,  whereas
the Act deals with squatters and the legislature did not intend it to  apply
to tenants.

The ANC's second flawed argument is that they have failed  to  explain  that
the business of the Post Office  and  that  of  the  courier  companies  are
entirely different in the reserved area.  The  Post  Office  offers  a  very
necessary and basic service, while courier  companies  offer  a  value-added
service. By way of example, the Post Office sells potatoes to the end  user,
while the courier companies add value to the potatoes and sell them  to  the
end user as potato salad or chips.

Not only will this Bill have a material effect on the  future  existence  of
these companies, but it  will  also  deny  the  consumer's  right  to  basic
choice. This travesty of justice is further exacerbated when  one  considers
that the Bill allows the  Post  Office  to  subcontract  these  services  to
wholly owned subsidiaries of the Post Office without a licence.  One  cannot
but think that this is yet another ANC vehicle for  cronyism  and  jobs  for
pals.

In conclusion, the DA cannot support this Bill. We believe that  competition
is the best mechanism to offer  choice,  the  best  choice  to  offer  lower
prices and the best mechanism to provide universal service. The  DA  further
believes that in order to rescue the floundering  Post  Office  and  provide
some form of stability to this industry,  it  is  high  time  for  a  postal
colloquium, in a similar vein to the convergence  colloquium  held  recently
after unrelenting pressure from the DA.

At the very least, we expect the ANC to make good on  the  promise  made  by
the Minister of Communications in 1998, when the Minister  stated  that  the
monopoly of the Post Office should be reviewed after  three  years.  We  are
still waiting, two years later. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Deputy Chairperson, today the DA express,  to  a  large  degree,
the policy position of the IFP, and that is support for free enterprise  and
the view that Government should not  compete  with  the  private  sector  in
spheres of delivery which, inevitably, can be performed better  and  cheaper
by businesses owned and controlled by a variety of investors.

However, our sympathy for this ideological view is tempered by our  sympathy
too for the plight of the Post Office and its need to build capacity and  to
roll out services to many  millions  of  our  citizens  who,  for  instance,
currently do not have  postal  addresses  or  convenient  access  to  postal
services.

We will therefore support this amendment in the hope that  by  enabling  the
Post Office to strengthen its position and its  so-called  ``reserved  areas
of service'', the Post Office will  sooner,  rather  than  later,  cease  to
operate in a monopolistic manner; that it will have eradicated a huge  debt;
that it will  no  longer  be  dependent  on  Government  transfers  for  its
survival; that the postal needs of our citizens  will  have  been  addressed
and, finally, thereafter, that  competition  will  flourish  in  the  postal
sector. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Mnr die Voorsitter, myns insiens is die debat oor  hierdie
wetgewing streng gesproke nie werklik nodig nie, en ek beoog nie om die  agb
Raad en Minister se tyd met 'n paar steriele argumente te mors nie.  Ek  sou
baie eerder met die Raad en die agb Minister wou  praat  oor  die  skokkende
inligting wat ons vanoggend gekry het dat Engels  91,1%  van  die  TV-inhoud
uitmaak, en Afrikaans slegs 5% - om nie te praat van die slegs 1% Zoeloe  en
die ander inheemse tale met nog kleiner  persentasies  nie.  Dit  is  totaal
onaanvaarbaar. Net so onaanvaarbaar, byvoorbeeld, is die feit  dat  93%  van
die films Amerikaans is, en net 3% plaaslik en 4% van elders.

Maar nou ja, ons praat oor 'n ander debat en teen die tyd dat  die  Nuwe  NP
aan  die  beurt  kom,  is  die  tegniese  aspekte  van  wetsontwerpe   reeds
afgehandel, en as ek so  rondkyk,  is  dit  duidelik  dat  dit  eintlik  net
pligsbesef is wat 'n paar verdwaalde siele miskien so 'n  bietjie  lusteloos
in hul sitplekke hou. En dink net aan die arme publiek!

Voorts voel ek dit is die SA Poskantoor se plig  om  sy  bedryfsverliese  te
verminder, en hoewel daar goeie  vordering  daarmee  gemaak  word,  bly  dit
steeds 'n groot uitdaging. Nie alleen  sal  hierdie  wysigings  hopelik  tot
beter diens lei nie, maar ook 'n paar stuiwers inbring. Die  Nuwe  NP  steun
die wetgewing. [Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mrs  ANNA  VAN  WYK:  Mr  Chairman,  in  my  opinion  the  debate  on  this
legislation is, strictly speaking,  not  really  necessary,  and  I  do  not
intend to waste the time of the hon House and Minister with  a  few  sterile
arguments. I would far rather speak to the House and the hon Minister  about
the shocking information we received this morning that  English  constitutes
91,1% of television content, and Afrikaans only 5%  -  not  to  mention  the
mere 1% of Zulu  and  the  other  indigenous  languages  with  even  smaller
percentages.  This  is  totally  unacceptable.  Equally  unacceptable,   for
example, is the fact that 93% of the films are  American  and  only  3%  are
local and 4% from elsewhere.

Be that as it may, we are discussing a different debate and by the time  the
New NP has their turn, the technical aspects  of  Bills  have  already  been
dealt with, and if I look around, it is clear that it  is  actually  only  a
sense of duty which perhaps keeps a few lost souls  somewhat  listlessly  in
their seats. Think of the poor public!

Furthermore, I feel it is the duty of the  SA  Post  Office  to  reduce  its
operating losses and although good progress is being made  in  this  regard,
it remains a big challenge. These amendments will hopefully  not  only  lead
to better service, but also bring in a few pennies. The New NP supports  the
legislation. [Interjections.]]

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Deputy  Chair,  the  MF  has  been  pleased   with   the
metamorphosis undergone by the Post Office nationally,  resulting  in  great
improvement and efficiency in its services. The MF feels confident that  the
Post Office within South Africa shall do us proud on delivery.

In the light of  the  provisions  of  the  amending  Bill,  the  MF  has  no
objection to protecting the South African Post Office's  exclusive  function
to provide reserved postal services. The specification  of  a  timeframe  by
the hon Minister is  also  supported.  Further,  the  licensing  of  courier
companies to provide unreserved services is acceptable.

The MF proudly wishes the South African Post Office well in  its  endeavours
to provide services to the South  Africa  citizenry.  The  MF  mentions  its
satisfaction with the provisions in clause 2 regarding courier services  and
supports the Bill.

Mr M K LEKGORO: Chairperson, post is a basic need in society. Through  post,
citizens are able to communicate. They are enabled to enter  into  different
transactions.  They  are  able  to  receive  account  statements  from   any
institution they  do  business  with.  They  are  able  to  correspond  with
different government institutions in addressing their  rights  and  demands.
In a big way post makes citizens from all walks of life active  participants
in both the country's political and economic life.

The Postal Services Act imposes a universal service obligation on  the  Post
Office in terms of what the Act refers to  as  reserved  services.  Reserved
services cover those letters and articles that are no  more  than  1  kg  in
weight and restricted to a  particular  length,  width  and  thickness.  The
actual intention is that a letter or article of that size and weight  should
be posted or received  by  all  South  Africans  at  a  stipulated  low  and
affordable price, irrespective of whether that profits the Post Office.

Because business is profit driven,  it  clearly  will  only  be  willing  to
convey such postal items in those populated urban centres where the  returns
will be profitable. True to the tradition of business, they  will  argue  to
distribute to where it makes business sense, while leaving the  Post  Office
to distribute to the far-flung areas at a loss. No one can  stand  here  and
argue that there would be competition in  such  a  situation.  Clearly,  the
playing fields in such a scenario are not level.

Imposing a universal service obligation on any  profit-driven  venture  will
limit its ability to operate, if not grind its business to a halt. To  offer
an  unfettered  licence  to  profit-driven  ventures  is  to  undermine  the
intended universal service obligation we wish to impose on the Post  Office.
Cognisant of this reality, the Act  gives  the  Post  Office  the  exclusive
right to provide a service in posting a letter and article of the  size  and
weight we described above.

The impression should not be created that reserved services  constitute  the
whole of what postal service is about. It constitutes a lower percentage  of
total postal business while the rest of the percentage or  greater  area  of
business is open to competition. Let us put it on  record  that  giving  the
Post Office an exclusive right for reserved services  is  a  practice  known
throughout  the  democratic  world.  In  fact,  advanced  democracies   like
Belgium, France and Greece limit reserved services to 2 kg, which  is  twice
as high compared to the South African situation.

We should also mention that the amendment before us  today  does  not  bring
anything new, other than to confirm the original intention of  the  Act  and
establish certainty after a court challenge on this  matter.  The  intention
of the principal Act and the reason behind the amendment is  to  enable  the
Post Office to deliver basic postal services to all South Africans, be  they
rich or poor, in urban or rural areas, white or black.

An objection to the Bill,  although  shrouded  in  concepts  of  freedom  to
compete, is an objection to deliver to  those  areas  of  our  society  that
matter. This is basically an objection to deliver to the poor, an  objection
to deliver to the far-flung rural areas, an objection to  deliver  to  black
people in general. [Interjections.]

Driven by our desire to be counted on the side of goodwill,  we  accordingly
support the Bill. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Hon  Chairperson,  I'd  like  to  thank  the
members who have indeed supported  this  Bill,  because  this  Bill  is  not
intended to do the kinds of things that we have heard from the DA here.  The
DA says we want to entrench monopoly. It is quite clear that we actually  do
want to move towards competition, and that is why we said that  we  have  to
have a review after three years.
The DA also said that they put pressure on us to have a  colloquium,  as  in
the convergence colloquium. I hope that they are  not  suffering  from  some
kind of delusion, because the colloquiums we held, we held in  terms  of  e-
commerce when we did the ICT sector, because it has been  the  tradition  of
this ANC and  this  Government  to  consult.  The  fact  that  we  held  the
convergence colloquium is part of  that  tradition.  I  think  you  must  be
suffering delusions of grandeur on that score.

We also heard that this was in order to make allowance for cronyism  in  the
ANC. If anything indicates cronyism, which we are suffering from  today,  it
is indeed the result of the  previous  government's  cronyism  in  the  Post
Office that has resulted in where we are  today.  [Interjections.]  This  is
the mess that the ANC Government and I  have  had  to  clear  up.  That  has
nothing to do with ANC cronyism. [Interjections.]  We  brought  on  board  a
partner to help us out of the problem, but once we realised  that  that  was
not going to happen, we decided to cancel the  contract  and  said  that  we
would do it ourselves, and you have seen the turnaround in the  Post  Office
of doing it ourselves. [Interjections.]

We all know  that  the  private  sector  does  not  always  work  perfectly.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order,  hon  members,  you  may
interject but, please, you may not howl and you may not disturb the  speaker
from the floor. Continue, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: What we would like to say is that  this  has
not been an easy way of going about doing our Government work, as  we  could
have gone into competition much earlier. We have had  support  from  people,
for example the IFP, who say that this is the direction that  they  want  to
go in, but also recognise the problems on the  other  side.  They  therefore
support that Bill, because they, as South African  citizens,  are  cognisant
of the challenges that are facing the Post Office  and  to  which  the  Post
Office has risen.

I thank all those members who are part of this group of South  Africans  who
want to see the Post Office go forward. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Alliance dissenting).

The House adjourned at 18:06.
