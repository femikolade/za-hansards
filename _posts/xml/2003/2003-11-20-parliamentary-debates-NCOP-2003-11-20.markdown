                        ALIVE CAMPAIGN AGAINST CRIME

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the fact that the Minister for Safety and Security, the
       hon Charles Nqakula, and the New NP have pledged their support for Ms
       Lynne Vince-Jillings and her campaign against crime, saying that they
       would endorse any initiative taken by any sector of the population in
       campaigns such as the  ALIVE  campaign  to  mobilise  people  against
       crime;


  (2) further notes that the campaign, which is  being  led  by  Ms  Vince-
       Jillings whose son was killed  in  a  hijacking  earlier  this  year,
       includes a march against crime planned for 30 November 2003; and


  (3) given the fact that crime cuts across all communities  and  political
       parties, expresses its support for the call made by the hon  Minister
       and the  New  NP  on  all  political  formations,  other  groups  and
       individuals to join in the march and to unite  as  a  nation  against
       crime.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that South African  President  Thabo  Mbeki  on  Wednesday,  19
       November 2003,  concluded  a  successful  three-day  state  visit  to
       France;


  (2) further notes that this visit  reinforced  the  close  political  and
       economic ties between France and South Africa;


  (3) acknowledges the importance of developed countries such as France  in
       contributing to our efforts as Africans to lead  our  continent  down
       the path to economic prosperity; and


  (4) commends our President for the key role that  he  plays  in  Africa's
       development through Nepad.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   CONCERN ABOUT GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD

                             (Draft Resolution)


Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, I move without notice that:


  The Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   genetically  modified  organisms  (GMOs)  can  be  defined   as
           organisms in which the genetic material (DNA) has  been  altered
           in a way that does not occur naturally by mating or  by  natural
           recombination, and that it allows selected individual  genes  to
           be transferred  from  one  organism  to  another,  also  between
           nonrelated species;


       (b)  in response to the many actual and potential dangers posed by GM
           foods, a question (Question No 163) was put by Mr K D S Durr  to
           the Minister of Health, the reply of which indicated that  final
           draft regulations governing the Labelling of Foodstuffs Obtained
           Through  Certain  Technologies  of  Genetic   Modification   are
           currently with the Department of Health's  legal  unit  and  are
           being compiled for publication; and


       (c)  that the Minister also indicated that no  specific  handling  or
           storage requirements for GM foods are to be prescribed in  South
           Africa,  but  rather  that  persons  wishing  to  claim  certain
           foodstuffs are not genetically modified will need to demonstrate
           identity  preservation   throughout   the   whole   food   chain
           themselves;


  (3) believes that placing the onus upon natural food suppliers  to  prove
       the uncontaminated status of their food is a  diabolical  convolution
       of reality, and that the onus should be on GM foods producers not  to
       contaminate natural non-GM foods in the growing and  handling  phases
       and to label them accordingly;


  (4) is of the view that it is not right that the public, some 92% of whom
       do not wish to eat GM foods, will effectively have to pay  a  premium
       to do so;


  (5) calls upon the Government to think very hard before  inflicting  this
       potential blight upon South Africa and to review its suggested regime
       for handling, storing and labelling of GM foods; and
  (6) urges the Government to look  at  EU  traceability  requirements  for
       handling GM foods, and not to US food imperialists who wish to  bring
       food dependence to Africa that threatens our biodiversity.

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  an
objection? Is that an  objection?  [Interjections.]  In  the  light  of  the
objection, the motion may not proceed and  therefore  becomes  notice  of  a
motion.

              SPEAKER AWARDED COUNCIL OF EUROPE DEMOCRACY PRIZE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms R P MASHANGOANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride that the Speaker of  the  National  Assembly,  Frene
       Ginwala, has been awarded the North-South Prize  of  the  Council  of
       Europe for 2003;


  (2) further notes that this award is in recognition of the  leading  role
       she is playing in promoting parliamentary democracy in Africa and her
       unselfish commitment to human rights; and


  (3) commends the Speaker on her outstanding achievement.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS NOW AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO NEED IT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the New NP -


       (a)  wishes to congratulate the Cabinet on the long-awaited  decision
           to  approve  a  National  HIV/Aids  treatment  plan  that   will
           eventually make antiretroviral drugs available to all  who  need
           it; and


       (b)  as one of the campaigners for this  since  1998,  welcomes  this
           decision as a major turning point in the fight against Aids;


  (2) is of the view that the implementation of this plan will  also  serve
       as a key building block in the delivery of health services as a whole
       in South Africa;


  (3) believes that what we now need is a common effort  and  a  collective
       will to tackle the enormous challenges that will have to be faced  in
       future to beat Aids;


  (4) extends its sincere thanks to all concerned for the tremendous effort
       they have put into this plan and congratulates them on what they have
       achieved.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

         CONGRATULATIONS TO DEPARTMENTS ON SUPPORT OF POOR STUDENTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Departments of Health and of Social Development  in
       Limpopo for identifying about 250 students  from  poor  families  who
       receive food parcels;


  (2) notes that those students are now being  trained  as  nurses  -  even
       though that won't be enough, there will  at  least  be  someone  from
       those families who will be earning a salary;


  (3) calls upon other provinces to follow suit; and


  (4) congratulates the MEC for Health, Mr Sello Moloto, for coming up with
       such progressive initiatives.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

     ALLEGATIONS AGAINST DEPUTY PRESIDENT DISMISSED BY ETHICS COMMITTEE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J MKALIPHI: Hon Deputy Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that  Parliament's  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics  and  Members'
       Interests on Wednesday, 19 November 2003, dismissed allegations  that
       Deputy President  Jacob  Zuma  breached  the  institution's  code  of
       conduct for MPs by not declaring benefits;


  (2)  acknowledges  that  the  investigation  process  was  an  open   and
       transparent process within which all political parties, including the
       DP, participated;


  (3) expresses its disappointment, therefore, at the refusal of the DP  to
       accept the outcome of this process; and


  (4) commends Parliament and the ANC for their commitment to promote open,
       accountable and transparent governance.

[Applause.]

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  an
objection? [Interjections.] In the light of the  objection  the  motion  may
not be proceeded with and becomes notice of a motion.

                 RESEARCH BY HUMAN SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Deputy Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the results of a recent survey by the Human  Sciences  Research
       Council in its SA Social Attitudes Survey, which  predicts  that  the
       ANC will win a two-thirds majority in next year's  general  elections
       and in the process increase its seats in Parliament from the  current
       266 members to 271 in 2004;


  (2) is of the opinion that this  prediction  is  an  affirmation  of  the
       correctness of the ANC's policies and programmes in transforming  our
       country in accordance with the expectations of the majority of  South
       Africans;


  (3) further believes that the increased majority  signifies  a  stamp  of
       approval for the Ten Year Review and a mandate to continue  with  its
       programme to alleviate poverty and create access to opportunities for
       all South Africans.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  any
objection to the motion? [Interjections.] There  is  an  objection.  In  the
light of the objection, the motion may not be proceeded with and  becomes  a
notice of motion.

       ander provinsies en skole gevolg sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairman, I move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) is impressed with and proud of the Eastern Cape and  the  14  Eastern
       Cape schools    that received green flags and certificates for  their
       environmental projects over the past six months;


  (2) notes that these schools, part of  a  group  of  30  in  other  South

         LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONTRIBUTION TO IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the new framework for  a  developmental  local  government
       provides  substantial  opportunities  to   address   the   challenges
       associated with poverty eradication;


  (2) acknowledges the positive contribution that has been  made  by  local
       government to focus their efforts  and  resources  on  improving  the
       quality of life of their communities, particularly the  disadvantaged
       sectors,  through  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  integrated
       development plans and local economic development initiatives;
  (3) commends the Minister and Deputy Minister for  Provincial  and  Local
       Government and the department for programmes such as the Consolidated
       Municipal  Infrastructure  Programme  and   the   Municipal   Systems
       Improvement Programme aimed at supporting  local  government  as  the
       lead agencies in our battle to confront poverty and underdevelopment.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Ms N C NKONDLO: Chairperson, because a  motion  very  similar  to  mine  was
tabled today, I shall withdraw mine. Thank you.

                          PROJECTIONS FOR ELECTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes the result of the recent extensive nationwide study done by the
       Human  Sciences  Research  Council  into   the   2004   parliamentary
       elections, announced yesterday;


  (2) further notes that according to projections contained in the study -


       (a)  the ANC will secure over  a  two-thirds  majority,  which  makes
           absolute nonsense of the DA's  claim  of  being  an  alternative
           government, even with the support of  the  IFP,  and  shows  the
           absolute futility of their confrontational style of politics;


       (b)  the New NP is the third biggest, and also  the  fastest  growing
           political party as it would pick up seven seats in the  National
           Assembly, taking it from  28  seats  in  1999  to  35  in  2004,
           compared to the second-fastest growing  party,  the  ANC,  which
           would gain five seats, taking it from 266 seats in 1999  to  271
           in 2004;


       (c)  the New NP is the most representative  political  party  of  the
           larger parties with 42% of its support coming from the  coloured
           community;


       (d)  the New NP and the ANC will retain control of the Western  Cape,
           the prediction being that the New NP will be the  biggest  party
           in the Western Cape;


       (e)  the DA-IFP alliance will fall short of a majority over  the  ANC
           and the New NP in KwaZulu-Natal;


       (f)   that  the  ANC's  support  in  all  the  other   provinces   is
           overwhelming; and


  (3) is of the view that this study -


       (a)   shows  the  absolute  falseness  and  absurdity  of  the   DA's
           propaganda that the New NP is a dying party and  that,  instead,
           the gap between the New NP and the DA is fast narrowing; and ...
[Time expired.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chair, I do not wish to object. I wish to propose an amendment.

An HON MEMBER: What amendment?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): You want  to  move  an
amendment? [Interjections.]

Ms C BOTHA: No, don't worry, because the New NP now has more votes than  you
in the Western Cape. I wish to add that caveat that the HSRC ...

Mr V V Z WINDVO[e]L: Deputy Chair, on a point  of  order:  I  want  to  know
whether it is in order to amend an incomplete motion, because it may  happen
that the things she wants to raise are covered  in  the  last  part  of  the
motion. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Let  her  move  the
amendment, and we shall then hear from the  one  who  moved  it  whether  he
accepts it. Let us hear your amendment, hon member.

Ms C BOTHA: Hon Chairperson, I would like to add something. The motion  ends
with:


  ... we take cognisance of the fact that in 2000 the HSRC  predicted  that
  the DA would get 12% of the vote, and that this ended up being 23%.

Thank you. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  The  amendment  has
been raised by the member, but I am not going to put it  to  the  House.  It
will appear on the Order Paper. [Interjections.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chair, on a point of order: I do not accept the amendment.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): It  is  all  right.  I
have already said that the motion, your motion, will  appear  on  the  Order
Paper. That was the last member to move a motion.

                        ITEM REMOVED FROM ORDER PAPER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That, notwithstanding Rule 23(2), the House meets at 10:00 on Tuesday, 25
  November 2003.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL FINANCE MANAGEMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the
National Treasury is pleased  that  the  debate  on  the  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill has reached the National Council  of  Provinces.  We  regard
this as an important milestone  in  the  process  of  finalising  the  long-
awaited legislative  framework  enabled  by  chapters  3,7  and  13  of  the
Constitution. It has taken the greater part of  three  years  to  draft  and
refine the Bill, and we have lost count of the numerous versions.

The Bill covers for the local sphere of government similar issues  that  the
Public Finance  Management  Act  covers  for  the  national  and  provincial
spheres. This Bill was originally planned to be part of the  Public  Finance
Management Bill when first  prepared  for  tabling  in  1998.  However,  the
specific characteristics of local government  were  so  different  from  the
national and provincial spheres that it warranted a separate Bill.

The Bill involved two significant rounds of amendments to the  Constitution.
The first amendment which was passed in 2001  amended  section  230  of  the
Constitution, which deals with municipal borrowing, by adding a new  section
230(a) to permit municipal borrowing and long-term contracts.

A second amendment was effected early  this  year  to  section  139  of  the
Constitution, and dealt  with  provincial  intervention  in  municipalities,
allowing for a  structured  process  with  initial  discretionary  and  then
mandatory intervention by provincial government  in  the  event  of  serious
financial crisis in a municipality,  where  the  ability  to  provide  basic
services is impaired.

Both  these  amendments  were  necessary,  not  only  to  resolve  municipal
financial crises, but also to protect municipalities and to reduce the  risk
premium for municipalities when  they  borrow  funds.  It  further  protects
municipalities whilst they are resolving their problems to  enable  them  to
continue providing services. Moreover, it provides certainty to lenders  and
investors about action that can be taken against municipalities that do  not
meet their financial obligations.

National Government is  committed  to  facilitating  a  municipal  borrowing
market and will take steps to ensure that all spheres of Government  act  on
their  constitutional  responsibilities.   This   commitment   will   enable
Government to maximise delivery and allow municipalities that  are  able  to
borrow, to lower their costs of borrowing for  capital  expenditure  and  to
attract investors.

At the same time we alert municipalities against attending  courses,  events
and  programmes  on  this   legislation   provided   by   nonregistered   or
nonaccredited institutions offering little value  for  money.  The  National
Treasury,  as  part  of  our  strategy  in  supporting  municipalities,  has
initiated the employment of over 100 recently  graduated  interns  from  our
disadvantaged communities to serve in municipalities across the country.

Furthermore, the National Treasury is in the process of developing  a  well-
structured programme to enhance the technical skills  required  for  prudent
financial management in municipalities.

A key focus of reform relates to a comprehensive overhaul of  the  budgeting
and  financial  management  system  at  municipal  level.  These  processes,
systems, documents and information are often not people-friendly  or  easily
understood. We aim to move  away  from  the  one-year  line  item  budgeting
approach.

Budget reforms such as the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework,  budgeting  by
programmes,  linking  plans  to  resources  and  focusing  on  outputs   and
performance have not generally  been  implemented,  save  for  a  few  pilot
municipalities at  the  local  sphere.  The  Bill  before  this  House  will
introduce these reforms to municipalities over the next few years.

As with the PFMA, the approach to financial management gives effect  to  the
principle  of  ensuring  effective  accountability  for   the   policy   and
implementation processes. The mayor  will  be  responsible  for  policy  and
outcomes, and the municipal manager for outputs and implementation.

Another aspect of the Bill deals with the  strengthened  oversight  role  by
councillors over the municipal executive and officials with regards  to  the
implementation   of   the   budget   and   regular   performance   reporting
requirements. The oversight and timely reporting to municipal  councils  are
essential requirements for  improved  performance  and  accountability.  The
Bill provides for  a  transparent  public  process  with  the  execution  of
projects and improved quality of information allowing for  strategic  policy
decisions to be made on a timely and informed basis.

The proper, efficient and effective use  of  public  funds  is  another  key
instrument at Government's disposal to address the developmental  challenges
facing our country. Hence, the Bill provides  for  improved  governance  and
oversight over entities, and  at  the  same  time  imposes  tough  sanctions
against accounting officers who fail to  submit  financial  statements  soon
after the end of the financial year.

This measure is in line with the PFMA and deals  with  the  legacy  of  poor
compliance. Just as this is no longer tolerated for national and  provincial
departments, it will not be tolerated for municipalities.

Moreover, the annual report  will  include  reports  on  performance  to  be
audited in terms of the Systems Act. The annual  report  will  also  include
details of  all  intergovernmental  grants,  ensuring  that  these  are  all
budgeted for by the municipality and spent in accordance with  the  approved
budget.

The Bill also obliges municipalities to disclose the  remuneration  packages
of the mayor, the municipal manager, councillors and senior  officials.  The
annual  report  will  serve  as  an  important  tool  for  empowering   both
councillors  and  the  local  community  to  hold  the  municipal  officials
accountable for their performance in the delivery of services.

The  Bill  facilitates  greater  co-ordination  between   the   spheres   of
Government,  especially  in  the  areas  of  budgeting,   planning,   policy
implementation  and  the  auditing  process.  The  Bill  promotes   a   more
consultative and transparent process for national organs of state  providing
bulk resources such as electricity and water to  municipalities,  especially
around  price-setting  policies.  There  is  also  a   process   to   manage
intergovernmental financial disputes.

The  Bill  will  also  promote  public-private  partnerships   by   allowing
municipalities to enter into  long-term  contracts,  subject  to  a  regular
review.

It is important to note that  the  Bill  allows  for  a  greater  degree  of
consultation and  communication  with  communities,  residents,  ratepayers,
lending institutions and so on.

Municipalities must rise to the challenge by ensuring greater  accessibility
to these documents by all the communities they service.  There  is  also  an
important role for the private sector to assist municipalities by  investing
and lending, and through public-private partnership initiatives.

We are grateful for the  debates  and  comments  received  during  the  NCOP
process,  and  which  have  led  to  a  significant  strengthening  of   the
monitoring and support role by provincial government in  nurturing  our  new
local government dispensation.

The role of provincial treasuries relates largely to  budget  and  financial
monitoring, rendering support and advice  on  budget-related  processes  and
policies. The sharing of information within provinces and an oversight  role
by provincial legislatures will allow for a coherent engagement.

The challenges are large, and many municipalities will be requiring  support
to implement this legislation. We  are  developing  a  coherent  package  of
support  and  urge  all  municipalities  to  take  advantage  of   this   in
implementing the legislation. This Bill is one of  the  foundation  Acts  of
Parliament, required by the Constitution and the 1998 White Paper  on  Local
Government.

In conclusion, we'd like to thank a number of persons who  have  contributed
towards  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill:  the
Minister for Provincial and Local Government, the MECs for finance  and  for
local government, the chairperson and the Select Committee  on  Finance  and
all members of the provincial finance and local  government  committees  for
their support and guidance during the processing of the Bill.

We'd  also  like  to  thank  officials  from  the  national  and  provincial
departments, organised local government and, especially, the  tireless  band
of  dedicated  officials  in  the  National  Treasury  who  contributed   in
presenting the Bill to this House today. The challenge ahead  is  to  ensure
the successful implementation of the Bill.

Thank you very much, Deputy Chair. We are aware that there are  some  errors
which, during the course of the debate today, are going to  be  effected  on
this Bill. Thanks a lot, Chair. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU:  Chairperson,  hon  members  and  the  Deputy  Minister  of
Finance, it is with regret that I note  that  the  provincial  legislatures'
representatives are not in this House today and, to me, that  is  a  serious
concern because the Bill is of an important nature and  we  would  all  have
benefited from their contribution in the debate.

However, we will proceed with the discussion, as we  are  empowered  by  the
Constitution of our country. Section 216(1) of the  Constitution  prescribes
that there must be uniform  financial  norms  and  standards,  and  Treasury
measures which are applicable to all government departments  by  legislation
must be prescribed.

In 1999 Parliament passed the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  regulating
financial management in  both  national  and  provincial  departments.  This
Bill, the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill, which we  are
talking about today, applies to all municipalities, all  municipal  entities
and national  and  provincial  organs  of  state  to  the  extent  of  their
financial involvement in dealing with different municipalities.

The Bill before this House was deliberately omitted at the time  of  dealing
with the Public Finance Management Act, primarily because  local  government
was still undergoing major  transformation  in  terms  of  the  demarcations
which were only finalised before the 2000 local government elections.

As a result of the above  scenario,  municipalities  have  been  functioning
without a legislative framework, and this Bill seeks to  introduce  the  set
of framework  within  which  municipalities  must  operate  in  relation  to
Treasury control measures and financial management.

Issues were raised in the committee, and I'll just raise a few of them.  One
of the issues was the tagging of the Bill - why the Bill  was  tagged  as  a
section 75 Bill instead of a section 76 Bill. The  committee  was  convinced
that the decision to tag the Bill as a section 75 Bill was the correct  one.
Despite the fact that we were convinced that the decision  was  correct,  we
consulted with the senior legal counsel, who were constitutional lawyers  in
their own right, and we also consulted with the parliamentary law  advisers.
We, therefore, came to the conclusion that the joint-tagging  mechanism  did
consider pertinent issues regarding  the  tagging  and,  therefore,  it  was
correct to tag the Bill as a section 75 Bill.

This Bill will be administered, firstly, by the National Treasury,  but  the
role of monitoring will be delegated to provincial treasuries, and the  Bill
covers the role of the provincial treasury  extensively,  as  well  as  what
they must do after being delegated by the National Treasury.

The National Treasury will enforce compliance within the  prescript  of  the
Constitution, section 216 in  particular.  In  the  spirit  of  co-operative
governance in the main, the National Treasury will  consult  the  Department
of Provincial and Local Government where required or where necessary.

I will now talk about municipal revenues. The Bill makes provision for  each
municipality to open at least  one  bank  account  which  will  be  used  to
deposit all moneys  received  by  the  municipality  within  the  prescribed
framework, in accordance with Chapter 3 of the Local  Government:  Municipal
Finance Management Bill.

Municipalities may not open a bank account  outside  the  borders  of  South
Africa, or with an institution which is  not  registered  in  terms  of  the
Banks Act of 1990, amongst others. This provision has come as  a  result  of
municipalities having many accounts in the previous era,  and  most  of  the
time only a few officials knew what those accounts were about and  how  much
money was in those accounts.

When municipalities open a bank account, they must submit those  details  of
the bank accounts to the National Treasury,  to  the  provincial  treasuries
and also to the Auditor-General. Accounting officers of municipalities,  who
are municipal managers in this case, will  administer  these  accounts,  and
they must also ensure that they are enforced. It is  hoped  that  this  will
enhance transparency in terms of the bank accounts that municipalities  hold
in different institutions.

There's also a provision  in  the  Bill  that  deals  with  the  failure  of
municipal councils to approve the budget. The Bill also makes provision  for
circumstances where a municipal council fails to approve its  annual  budget
and its revenue-raising measures to collect required  revenue  in  order  to
give meaning to the budget.

The Bill ensures that mechanisms are in place to ensure a process where  the
municipal council must try over and over again  till  the  budget  has  been
approved.  In  circumstances  where  the  budget  cannot  be  approved   for
political reasons, amongst others, the Bill makes provision  for  provincial
government to intervene.

Clause 55 of the Bill, which makes  the  intervention  necessary,  reads  as
follows:


  If a municipality has not approved an annual budget by the first  day  of
  the budget year or if the municipality  encounters  a  serious  financial
  problem referred to in section 136, the mayor of the municipality -


  a)  must immediately report the matter to the MEC for local government in
       the province and


  b)  may recommend to the MEC an appropriate  provincial  intervention  in
       terms of section 139 of the Constitution.

I think this provision ensures that there is a clear  monitoring  mechanism,
in particular where budgets are unable to be passed. I  think  the  previous
intervention that the NCOP  has  made  in  different  municipalities  was  a
result of the failure of some legislative mechanism that existed.  So,  this
provision seeks to close that gap and that loophole.

The budgets of municipal councils  must  be  informed  by  their  integrated
development plans, as prescribed in the Local Government: Municipal  Systems
Act, namely that there  must  be  time  provided  to  give  the  public  the
opportunity  to  make  comments  on  the  draft  budgets  and  the   revenue
projections, including the increase in rates and taxes. The public  must  be
given an opportunity to comment and make  suggestions  or  object,  if  they
have any objections.

Municipal councils must also ensure that procurement of goods  and  services
is guided by the supply chain mechanism as prescribed in the legislation.  I
have  a  serious  concern  with  this  supply  chain  mechanism,   but   not
necessarily with the principle which is raised in the Bill. The  concern  is
that the supply chain has not been tabled, neither in Parliament nor in  the
committees of Parliament, in this case the  finance  committees.  They  have
neither seen nor laid sight on this supply chain.

Despite the existence of the  preferential  procurement  legislation,  which
came as a result of the provision of the Constitution, there is  no  mention
made  of  this  in  the  legislation.  Therefore  this  remains  a   serious
challenge, and my  question  is:  Which  framework  will  municipalities  be
operating under, since the supply chain is not  a  law  or  any  kind  of  a
policy? I think this is important for clarity in the Treasury, and also  for
municipalities to be able to have a  proper  legal  framework  within  which
they are going  to  be  operating,  in  particular  around  the  procurement
issues.

Councillors will no longer be allowed to sit on tender  committees,  as  has
been the case in the past, or to  serve  on  committees  that  evaluate  the
tenders or approves tenders, quotations, contracts or other bids,  nor  will
they be allowed to attend any meeting that  considers  tender  processes  as
observers.

This provision is very important because it will  allow  municipal  councils
to exercise oversight over the work of the tender committees. On  the  other
hand, it is a good decision because there is a  wide  perception  out  there
that councillors  are  corrupt,  and  through  this  provision  a  fair  and
transparent process will be promoted and ensured.

There is also a provision in the  Bill  that  deals  with  the  disposal  of
assets, municipal assets in particular, controlled  by  municipal  entities.
Municipalities may not transfer ownership as a result of  a  sale  or  other
transaction, or dispose of a capital  asset  needed  to  provide  a  minimum
level of basic services to that particular community.

This provision is aimed at ensuring that municipalities do  not  dispose  of
capital assets that provide basic services to people,  though  it  was  very
difficult for the committee to accurately  define  the  basic  services  and
what we are talking about exactly. The Local Government:  Municipal  Systems
Act tries to give some indication as to what these basic services  are,  but
I think the Bill provides for that.

Also, the role of provinces in supporting and  monitoring  local  government
in relation to their IDPs is very important. These are  annual  reports  and
annual budgets.  Provinces  will  in  future  play  a  significant  role  in
monitoring   budgets,   financial   statements   and   audit   reports    of
municipalities. This will ensure that problems are identified  timeously  in
order to secure provincial  intervention.  These  reports  will  give  early
warning signs and where necessary, intervention  must  be  made  before  the
situation is exacerbated.

Section 154(1) of the Constitution makes provision  that  the  national  and
provincial government must give support to the lower spheres of  government,
in  particular  local  government.  Chapter  5  of  the  Local   Government:
Municipal Finance Management Bill, which we are  considering  today,  spells
out  the  capacity-building  role  of  both  the  provincial  and   national
Government.

Currently, there is an anomaly that exists, in the sense that  Salga,  which
is organised local government, does not report anywhere for the moneys  they
receive from the Department of Provincial and Local Government or  from  the
different municipalities from which they are getting levies.  The  committee
is of the view that this matter must be attended  to  with  the  urgency  it
deserves, because if left  like  this,  it  may  lead  to  situations  where
organised local government,  at  both  national  level  and  its  affiliated
provincial bodies, is accountable for all the resources they  are  allocated
from different departments through transfers.

So, we think that this provision must be attended to. We know that it  can't
be dealt with in the Local Government: Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill,
but probably through organised local government. The relevant  committee  in
the NCOP will look into the matter.

This Bill is a milestone in our democracy and it has been in the making  for
the past three years, but I'm happy that we are able  to  recommend  to  the
NCOP that the Bill be approved  with  the  amendments  made  in  the  select
committee. Given the very tight deadline the  committee  and  the  officials
were subjected to, there are minor errors contained in the amended  document
that do not  reflect  the  approved  version  of  the  committee.  When  the
officials submitted the Bill to the printing  people  in  Parliament,  there
were some other words which were reflected in the errata.

This document, which is on everybody's desk, was  left  out.  So  now,  this
process seeks to make sure that those  are  effected  before  we  adopt  the
Bill, and we should take that into account.

We would like to thank all committee  members  who  participated  throughout
the process and earlier on  when  we  were  discussing  the  Bill  with  the
National Assembly, the portfolio committee, the provincial local  government
portfolio committees and provinces,  in  particular  the  Western  Cape  and
KwaZulu-Natal, who keenly participated in the process and  made  a  valuable
contribution in improving the Bill to what  it  is  today.  Thank  you  very
much. I call upon hon members to approve the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Deputy Chair and hon Deputy Minister, I suppose  the  House  can
be forgiven for considering this Bill somewhat of  an  institution.  It  has
been around, debated and amended, as was said here today,  for  about  three
years, and that is a marathon achievement by the  committee  and  the  legal
advisors who are drawing it to near finality here today.

At the onset I must admit that I was never part  of  the  finance  committee
deliberations, and my knowledge of  the  Bill  is  limited  to  reading  and
interparty discussions. I can  therefore  not  presume  to  make  more  than
comments relating to my constituency experience and  on  background  reading
on the matters which are addressed by this Bill.

When I say that it provides a policy framework  for  the  overall  financial
management in the local sphere of government, as  well  as  for  structuring
the borrowing powers of municipalities and providing essential  options  for
interventions in times of financial crisis, I hope that  I  have  understood
the issues properly. What I do know  very  clearly  is  that  the  financial
performance of local governments, or the lack  thereof,  is  having  a  very
direct impact on the daily lives of South African citizens.

Many inappropriate reactions from  ratepayers  have  become  embedded  as  a
response  to  the  flawed  political  and  financial  responses   of   local
governments to the needs of municipal  communities.  I  am  often  asked  to
support ratepayers who don't  want  to  pay  for  services  which  they  are
patently  not  enjoying.  The  ratepayers  in  the   towns   of   Kwakwatsi,
Viljoenskroon, Kroonstad,  Ngwati  and  Edenville  in  my  constituency  are
constantly confronted by raw sewage. They have every right to  expect  water
of a certain quality. They have a logical response in  not  wanting  to  pay
for what they are getting now.

In the same way citizens who were politically promised free  basic  services
are responding as logically by not paying for  services  in  expectation  of
the free offer.

While I do not agree with either, it is  one  real  side  of  the  municipal
story. On the other hand, without private finance for capital investment  in
municipal infrastructural  needs,  municipalities  can  neither  supply  the
basic nor the standard level of services required - services which  are  key
to economic growth and social equity.

I do not want to oversimplify the responses  needed  for  these  situations,
which I believe the present Bill will address, concentrating,  as  it  does,
both  on  accountability  and  practical  municipal  borrowing   strategies.
However, it will also need leadership from central level to create  credible
conditions at local level under which private finance will be forthcoming.

In the DA there was considerable debate on this  Bill  and  the  possibility
that it was opening up  undue  interference  by  National  Treasury  in  the
municipal sphere and in the principle of local government autonomy which  we
hold dear. Our concerns have been subsumed by the need to  face  the  actual
state  of  local  government  and  the  interventions  the  new  system   of
government requires. The increasing financial  difficulties  experienced  by
local municipalities cannot be addressed in an ad hoc fashion, but  need  to
be responded to in a systematic and sustainable  fashion,  which  this  Bill
provides.

We therefore support it  and  its  aims  of  presenting  Government  with  a
coherent policy and a legal and institutional  framework  for  dealing  with
fiscal and financial matters in municipalities. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman and Minister, it  has  taken  the  greater  part  of
three years to draft, redraft and refine  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
Finance Management Bill. In fact, in more than  40  committee  hearings  and
sittings on the LGMFMB that took  place  in  Parliament,  the  Western  Cape
province followed  the  developments  of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
Finance Management Bill over the past  two  years  closely,  often  attended
those meetings and were kept informed  by  the  Treasury  and  also  by  the
select committee of the NCOP.
Soon after the Minister of Finance tabled the LGMFMB in  Parliament,  during
February 2002, it was referred to the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance.  The
Western Cape province has selectively attended committee and  joint  meeting
hearings and regularly perused the minutes of these committee meetings.

As a province we respectfully insisted that the roles  and  responsibilities
of local government and treasuries be kept clearly  separated  and  defined.
Most of our comments and recommendations  that  we  have  made  along  these
lines regarding the relevant clauses were, in fact, accepted.  In  addition,
we commented in favour  of  allocating  original  powers  to  the  MECs  for
finance. We are glad that the bulk of these recommended amendments have  now
been incorporated into the version of  the  Bill  that  we  have  before  us
today.

Our  decided  view  is  that  the  National  Treasury,  together  with   the
provincial treasuries, are best placed  to  exercise  financial  and  fiscal
oversight  over  local  governments.  This  is  largely   based   on   their
experiences in budget and financial management reform  over  the  past  five
years which stand them in good stead in helping  to  build  a  viable  local
sphere that is responsive, fiscally  stable  and  sustainable.  However,  in
saying this, we recognise  that  the  establishment  of  financially  viable
municipalities  won't  be  possible  without  a  partnership   between   the
departments of local government and the treasuries.

We are satisfied with the current wording of  the  Bill,  but  are  reminded
that, as with any piece of legislation or policy,  there  will  be  teething
problems, especially with the implementation phase of the Act.

It is unfortunate that the Bill has  to  date  not  been  costed,  which  is
something that worries us. The National  Treasury  should  as  a  matter  of
urgency cost the LGMFMB in order to determine  the  financial  implications,
if they can, with a view to funding provinces and  municipalities  to  cover
the related costs of the LGMFMB, with the  proviso  that  the  principle  of
"funds follow function" must be respected.
Managers who will be operating within the three spheres of  government  need
to  familiarise  themselves  with  the  new  context  of  local   government
financial management,  especially  bearing  in  mind  the  new  competencies
required of them. In this regard we request the Minister  and  the  National
Treasury to make training available as a priority.  Minister,  we  can  make
the best laws in the world, but we have to  develop  the  capacity  and  the
administrative reach to give effect to that legislation.

We support the legislation, Minister, both as my party and  as  the  Western
Cape.

If I could just make a short appeal to  the  Deputy  Minister,  while  she's
with us.  I  put  a  question  on  the  Order  Paper  the  other  day  about
outstanding rates, and I see that  there  are  something  like  R80  million
outstanding to the Cape Town Metropole for rates on government buildings.  I
think the figure for East London is something like  R26  million  and  other
provinces all have, I think, large outstanding amounts. I think the  Western
Cape's amount is the  biggest,  if  I  am  not  mistaken.  We  would  really
appreciate it if you could attend to - I am sure  you  are  -  getting  that
cash flow going, and getting that backlog out of the way, and have a  system
in place so that it doesn't arise in the future. We know you will.

I have to say this is my favourite Deputy Minister.  I  hope  it's  not  bad
that I say this, Minister, but you and your officials have  been  wonderful.
I have to say  they  showed  a  lot  of  patience  and  put  out  voluminous
documents, very competently and well, and patiently. They have been  patient
with us and they have been patient with our provinces.  They  have  listened
to us. They have always responded when we put forward sensible  suggestions,
for which we are grateful. I think we are making ... [Time expired.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance  and  hon
colleagues, the high degree of importance attached to this Bill  is  clearly
demonstrated by the time devoted to it - from  the  first  Cabinet  approval
for publication in July 2000; through the second Cabinet approval in  August
2001 after consultation with provincial and local government, Salga and  the
FFC; to its final tabling in this House today - as  well  as  the  diligence
displayed by all the roleplayers in the crafting thereof.

The Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill will become,  so  to
speak, the Public Finance Management Act  of  local  government.  While  the
PFMA lays down uniform laws and standards for financial  management  in  the
national and provincial spheres of government, the LGMFM Bill  provides  for
those same uniform norms and standards on local government level.

The aim of the Bill is to  secure  transparency,  accountability  and  sound
management. It covers  a  wide  range  of  issues,  including  national  and
provincial supervision,  municipal  revenue  and  budgets,  municipal  debt,
treasury processes, council responsibilities and financial misconduct.

It requires  that  all  revenue,  expenditure,  assets  and  liabilities  of
municipalities and municipal entities be managed  economically,  efficiently
and  effectively.  It,  furthermore,  determines  the  responsibilities   of
persons entrusted with local government's financial management.

Generally, the municipal manager must take all reasonable  steps  to  ensure
compliance with the provisions of the  Bill,  and  shall  ensure  effective,
efficient and transparent systems  of  financial  and  risk  management  and
internal  control;  a  system  of  internal  audit  under  the  control  and
direction  of  an  audit   committee;   an   appropriate   procurement   and
provisioning system  which  is  fair,  transparent,  competitive  and  cost-
effective; and a system to properly  evaluate  all  major  capital  projects
prior to final decision on the project.

One of the members of a municipal  council  must  also  be  responsible  for
financial matters in the municipality. While the  councillor  for  financial
matters must exercise general political control over the  financial  affairs
of the municipality and must oversee expenditure and revenue collection,  he
or  she  may,  however,  not   interfere   in   the   financial   management
responsibilities assigned  to  the  municipal  manager  or  chief  financial
officer.

The Bill furthermore allows municipalities to conduct their cash  management
and  open  investment  ventures  within  the  framework  determined  by  the
National Treasury, who will monitor these investments. Short-term  debt  may
only be incurred as provided for by the terms of this Bill and must be  paid
off within the fiscal year. Long-term  debt  is  permissible  only  for  the
purpose of capital expenditure on property, plant or  equipment  to  achieve
the objects of local government or for refinancing existing long-term debt.

The Bill requires the National Treasury to ensure that  municipalities  have
the capacity to implement the financial responsibilities conferred on  them.
The Treasury will supervise their financial  management  and  monitor  their
budgets  to  establish  whether  they  are  consistent  with  the   national
Government's fiscal policy  framework  and  macro-economic  policy.  It  may
establish  an  annual  growth  factor;  assist   municipalities   to   build
efficient, effective and transparent  financial  management  practices,  and
review any system of  financial  management  and  internal  control  in  any
municipality.

The Bill also provides for a Municipal Financial Emergency Authority, or  an
MFEA, to  oversee  the  administration  of  municipalities  in  a  financial
emergency  with  a  view  to  normalise  the  financial  affairs   of   such
municipalities. There  are  specific  procedures  for  the  declaration  and
management of a recovery  plan  and  for  the  termination  of  a  financial
emergency. It gives specific powers to the courts in  this  regard,  and  it
also outlines the powers of the  executive  officer  of  the  MFEA  and  the
administrators  of  the  municipalities  declared  to  be  in  a   financial
emergency.

The Bill goes a long way in addressing past problems associated with a  lack
of transparency and accountability of local government finances.

It bodes well for the reform and sound management of municipal finances  and
is fully supported by the New NP.

Chairperson, if you will also allow me to make use of  this  opportunity  to
thank, on behalf of the New NP and, I am sure,  all  the  other  parties  in
this House, Mr Ismail Momoniat, at present the  Acting  Director-General  of
the Treasury, and his support staff, for their dedication and devotion,  and
the long hours they put in  towards  the  successful  finalisation  of  this
process. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chairperson, I would  like  to  thank
all the members who have participated in the debate. It is quite clear  that
the Bill enjoys a lot of support in the House. I think the  fact  that  much
time has been spent on  this  Bill  has  ensured  that  you  can  build  the
requisite support for a piece of  legislation  as  important  as  the  Local
Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill in the  context  of  financial
management in local government.
I think the support also indicates that we are  all  keenly  aware  of  just
this central role that local government plays in our lives  and  we  are  in
agreement that, in going forward, we have  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of
local government to play an even greater role in improving the lives of  our
people.

The chair of the committee raised an issue around  supply  chain  management
in relation to the preferential procurement  legislation  that  we  have  in
place. I do want  to  say  that  our  approach,  as  we  are  reforming  the
procurement system, is one that will ensure that our  procurement  system  -
in the way that it is managed at all levels of  Government  -  promotes  the
spirit of the Public  Finance  Management  Act  and  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Act when they do  become  law.  We  think  that
this is a critical part because departments spend a  lot  of  money,  a  big
portion of their budgets, on procurement. So, if  through  these  pieces  of
the legislation we would have facilitated and enhanced the  decentralisation
of financial management, it would be good, because  we  could  not  keep  an
important part of spending at all levels of Government  centralised,  as  it
is today, through the system of tender boards.

The move, therefore, towards the supply chain  management  approach  is  one
that will ensure that we are actually fully in keeping with  the  spirit  of
the PFMA and with the LGMFMA when they become Acts of  Parliament.  However,
this  is  a  matter  that  is  separate  from  the  issue  of   preferential
procurement legislation. The approach that we should take is that there  are
flaws that we have been able to identify  in  the  preferential  procurement
legislation, but these are changes that we are  hoping  to  effect  in  line
with other processes that are taking place in Government.

The issue,  for  instance,  around  aligning  the  preferential  procurement
legislation with the Broad-based Black  Economic  Empowerment  Strategy  and
the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Bill is an  important  aspect  in
whatever process we  are  going  to  undertake  to  amend  the  preferential
procurement legislation.
However, as for now we operate on the basis that all  public  entities,  all
Government  departments,  must  implement   the   preferential   procurement
legislation as it  stands  today.  Only  this  week  I  approved  a  set  of
regulations that are aimed both at initiating the process  of  supply  chain
management, as  well  as  improving  the  functioning  of  the  preferential
procurement legislation.

In a sense,  these  two  processes  are  linked.  However,  the  procurement
legislation, as it stands today, remains the law that is in force and  which
we are improving at the moment through a new  set  of  regulations.  In  the
medium term we are going to be amending that legislation to make  sure  that
it is in keeping with other processes and that we  are  able  to  deal  with
some of the weaknesses that were found through the experience  of  the  past
few years.

The issue of costing of the Local Government: Municipal  Finance  Management
Bill I would treat as perhaps separate from the  issue  of  funds  following
functions. I don't think we can take an approach that says when we  seek  to
improve financial management at local government we are imposing  functions.
This is something that is supposed to happen anyway. So I wouldn't  want  to
take the approach that says funds  must  follow  functions.  However,  quite
clearly, the costing issue is an important one, and at the  moment  we  have
in place a financial management  grant  specifically  for  local  government
which is meant to assist local authorities to  improve  their  capacity  for
financial management.

However, this is something that we are going to have to work on because,  as
you may understand, the local government  sphere  is  a  much  more  diverse
sphere than you have  for  the  provincial  government.  The  sizes  of  the
municipalities differ and the  requirements  of  financial  management  will
also differ, but I think the crucial thing is that we do  have  a  grant  in
place which is aimed at helping to build that  capacity  for  municipalities
to improve financial management.

I think from the experience of implementing the  Public  Finance  Management
Act, one of the biggest costs was to ensure  that  all  departments  appoint
appropriately qualified chief financial officers. The rest really  is  about
ensuring that we can put the proper systems in place  to  improve  financial
management. However, I take the point. It is an issue that we work on on  an
ongoing basis as we implement the  new  policy,  but  we  are  going  to  be
rolling out a number of other processes.

We are going to have training workshops that we  are  going  to  conduct  as
part of the roll-out of the Bill. We  are  also  introducing  an  internship
programmme which is also aimed at  kickstarting  the  process  of  improving
financial management. We will issue training guides and manuals. So  really,
I think the benefit of having implemented the PFMA will go  a  long  way  in
guiding  us  on  how  best  to  go  about   implementing   this   particular
legislation.

The issue  of  debt  management  is  an  issue  which  we  raised  from  the
Treasury's point of view because we think it is important that a  number  of
basic things do happen. Municipalities must be able to build  properly,  but
they must also build the capacity to collect revenue that is due to them.  I
think a large part of the debt actually relates, not just to the culture  of
nonpayment, but also to the basic inability of local authorities to  go  out
there and collect revenue.  We  must  address  both  of  these,  namely  the
capacity to collect revenue, and also changing  the  culture  of  nonpayment
that is there in our communities.

This is a matter that we often dealt with at the time when there were  calls
for writing off some of this debt. What we were  saying  was:  We  can  talk
about that, but we must be able to see that there is an  effort  to  go  out
and collect money that is outstanding. These are the things  which  I  think
are important.

The last point I would like to make is that we  think  the  future  is  with
local government. We are beginning to see some  very  positive  things  that
indicate that local government increasingly is going to play a  bigger  role
in our lives. If we look at the division of revenue, local  government,  for
example, is experiencing quite a healthy growth in  allocations.  Even  with
the  Budget  Policy  Statement  that  we  tabled  last  week,  the   biggest
percentage increase is to local government.  We  are  also  consolidating  a
variety of infrastructure grants that have  been  there  for  a  variety  of
things into a comprehensive municipal infrastructure grant. I think  all  of
these things are giving an indication that  local  government  is  going  to
play a bigger role in our lives. I  think  that  the  process  deserves  the
support of all of us, but  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  members  for
supporting the Bill.

Debate concluded.

Bill,     subject     to     the     proposed     amendments     and     the
errata/additions/corrections in respect of  the  amendments,  agreed  to  in
accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

            LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPALITY SYSTEMS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chair,  this  chair
is following me.

Deputy Chairperson, hon members, the transformation of local  government  in
South Africa is  one  of  the  most  far-reaching  and  important  processes
undertaken by the democratic Government since 1994.

The centrality of this  exercise  was  recognised  in  the  President's  Co-
ordinating Council by the President and the nine premiers in December  2001,
when they resolved in a workshop that local government  transformation  must
be accelerated by focusing on five strategic areas, namely, one, building  a
strong local government sphere and enhancing its status within a stable  co-
operative governance framework; two, building  a  financially  viable  local
government; three, building stable institutional and administrative  systems
in local government; four, improving and accelerating service  delivery  and
economic   development,   and   five,   deepening   local   democracy    and
accountability.

Today's deliberations in this  House  on  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
Systems Amendment Bill are consistent with  these  areas  of  priority.  The
policy rationale for this  Bill  seeks  to  consolidate  the  transformation
process and lays  the  basis  for  the  long-term  sustainability  of  local
government in this country.

When we embarked on the final leg of transforming local government with  the
elections  in  December  2000,  we  appreciated  that  certain   legislative
refinements  may  become  necessary  to   reinforce   the   overall   policy
orientation of developmental local  government.  This  Bill  speaks  to  key
areas where we have learned some valuable lessons  since  the  inception  of
the new system of developmental local government.

In April next year we will be celebrating  10  years  of  democracy  in  our
country. Of course, there will be nothing to  celebrate  if  the  vision  of
transformation of our society and improving the quality of the lives of  our
people are not translated into tangible actions and outcomes  at  the  local
level.

Our country has attained significant achievements and  gains  in  increasing
access to basic services and improving the quality of life  of  our  people.
The emergence of developmental local government can only serve  to  entrench
the gains made by our democratic state.

Progress in this regard is clearly demonstrated by the extent to  which  our
Government  has  accelerated  provision  of  basic  services  to   all   our
communities,  especially  the  previously  neglected  rural  areas.  Current
statistics show that in the past 10 years we have made a significant  impact
on the ground. For example, 3,5 million households now have access to  clean
water; 6 million people received houses; access to sanitation has  increased
by 63%, and over 70% of households  have  access  to  electricity.  This  is
significant and highly commendable progress that we have made.

Most  municipalities  have  now  reached  the  consolidation  phase  in  the
transformation process. In three  years  we  have  managed  to  develop  the
requisite systems and processes necessary to deliver basic services, and  we
have laid the basis for performance excellence.  Already,  we  are  able  to
demonstrate tangible progress in service delivery with regard to free  basic
services. We have achieved all this  through  continued  commitment  to  co-
operative governance by all three spheres of government.

The Bill being tabled here today should be  seen  as  an  extension  of  our
policy and legislative framework on local government. It  specifically  aims
to refine and encourage creativity and innovation by municipalities,  whilst
simultaneously ensuring transparency, accountability and good governance.

Premised on fundamental  principles  held  by  our  Government  of  ensuring
efficiency and excellence in service delivery, the framework  for  assigning
functions and powers between the spheres of government increases the  levels
of predictability and coherence in the intergovernmental systems.

The  national  and  provincial  spheres  of  government  are   required   to
adequately provide the requisite capacity and  financial  support  to  local
government  to  ensure  that  those  functions   or   powers   assigned   to
municipalities are effectively implemented. This  will  effectively  address
the  problem  of  unfunded  mandates   and   resolve   capacity   challenges
municipalities constantly face.

The impact of service delivery on the ground depends largely on the  ability
of municipalities to make sound  decisions  regarding  the  best  option  of
delivery they will use, as well as their ability to monitor and measure  the
performance in the process.

The positive feature of this Bill is that  municipalities  are  required  to
report on their overall performance in an annual performance report. In  the
reports, municipalities should consider the levels of  intended  impact  and
whether their expenditure is commensurate with the quality of services.  The
ultimate measure of the performance of municipalities is the improvement  of
the quality of the lives of our people.

As you know, hon members, our department launched the Vuna  Awards  in  June
this year. These awards recognise  the  performance  of  municipalities  and
reward excellence. Provinces are at the centre of this process as they  play
their support and oversight role. In the  past  few  months  provinces  have
been assessing and managing the awards, and through this process  they  have
identified the challenges faced by different municipalities.

The challenge we would like to put to the provinces today  is  for  them  to
continue to assess municipal performance, identify  the  capacity  gaps  and
develop intervention strategies that will support  municipalities  that  are
still struggling as they strive for performance excellence.

This Bill complements our efforts at deepening local democracy by  requiring
more transparency from municipalities. It strengthens access to  information
by communities by ensuring  that  all  municipal  documents  are  placed  at
strategic public places and are  accessible  to  all,  especially  in  rural
communities.

It further encourages technological innovation, where  possible,  to  ensure
that municipalities  are  linked  with  the  outside  world  by  setting  up
websites. This Bill  has  a  very  strong  focus  on  creating  an  enabling
environment for municipalities to be creative and innovative  in  delivering
services, while they remain transparent and take care of the  needs  of  the
poor.

The highlight of this Bill is the introduction of feasibility studies  which
provide certainty  and  predictability  regarding  the  output  of  using  a
particular method of service delivery.  It  outlines  the  cost,  value  for
money and timeframes, and compels municipalities to take into  consideration
the views of the local communities. This is critical to the  decision-making
process of municipalities and ensures the buy-in of communities.
It is prudent for  provincial  and  national  spheres  to  proactively  lend
support to municipalities to ensure that  the  outputs  are  achievable  and
sustainable, especially  in  municipalities  where  the  relevant  technical
capacity is not available.

Further innovations to service delivery  in  the  Bill  relate  to  external
mechanisms in the delivery of services. This  proposes  the  rationalisation
of municipal entities, but limits them only  to  those  that  have  a  sound
governance framework namely the private company, which is  governed  by  the
Companies Act, Service Utility and the Multi-Jurisdictional Service  Utility
as governed by the provisions of the Bill.

We are certain that service delivery  will  be  greatly  improved  by  these
entities. More communities will benefit,  especially  in  the  case  of  the
multijurisdictional service utilities,  where  more  than  one  municipality
owns the  entity.  Resources  will  be  pooled  and  efficient  delivery  of
services, even in areas where  municipalities  do  not  have  the  necessary
capacity to deliver, will be ensured.

The Bill also  enables  municipalities  to  engage  the  services  of  other
municipalities that have adequate capacity in a service delivery  agreement.
This will promote the  spirit  of  horizontal  co-operative  governance  and
efficient use of capacity and limited resources.

The  Bill  provides  clarity  regarding  the  governance  framework  of  the
entities. We need to keep in mind  that  service  delivery  is  primarily  a
Government obligation and the  entities  are  an  alternative  mechanism  by
which efficiency in delivery is ensured. Government's oversight  role  needs
to be the key focus to ensure that the  delegated  authority  complies  with
the principles of transparency and accountability.

The Bill  may  seem  to  be  limited  in  scope,  but  it  has  far-reaching
implications   for   service   delivery   and   enhanced   performance    of
municipalities. Therefore we need to ensure that the innovation provided  by
this Bill is nurtured and supported, and on 5 December  this  year,  we  can
proudly celebrate the evolving system of developmental local government.

In supporting these amendments  we  need  to  recommit  the  provincial  and
national  spheres  to  continuously  assess  municipal  performance,   while
recognising  that  municipalities  face  a  daunting  challenge  of  limited
capacity and resources. In assessing performance  excellence  for  the  Vuna
Awards that I referred to earlier, the  criteria  used  are  linked  to  the
critical mandate of  municipalities;  namely,  service  delivery;  promoting
economic  growth   and   job   creation;   municipal   transformation,   and
institutional  development;   municipal   financial   viability   and   good
governance.

We need to commend the 27 municipalities that won the Provincial Awards  and
make a  renewed  commitment  to  provide  support  by  using  the  framework
provided  by  this  Bill  to  improve  the  performance  of  all   the   284
municipalities in our country. We committed ourselves to building a  united,
nonracial, nonsexist and democratic society. We are  determined  to  achieve
this goal and we are well on course. The tide  has  turned.  I  commend  the
Local Government Municipal Systems Amendment Bill to  this  House.  I  thank
you, Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank you, hon Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Deputy  Minister
and hon members. Deputy Chairperson, I am wondering, when we  insist  during
committee meetings that we should corrade when deciding on  crucial  matters
like legislation, whether these Houses corrade and whether we  can  continue
with such pieces of legislation.

The Chairperson of the Select Committee on Finance lamented  the  fact  that
organised local government is not here. Surprisingly  enough,  she  and  two
other members of the committee, after passing their  Bill,  they  just  went
out. Surely, chairperson, that's not my business of today.

The business of managing a municipality is becoming not only  more  complex,
but more exciting these days. It  is  no  longer  the  routine  of  applying
somewhat lifeless by-laws and regulations, but the application  of  business
principles  and  processing  which  is  becoming  a  norm  rather  than   an
exception.

The Municipal Systems Amendment Bill on our tables this afternoon  seeks  to
make  these  important  innovations  to  enhance  the  capacity   of   local
government   service   delivery   and   also   tighten   transparency    and
accountability. The amendments mainly provide the basis  for  the  Municipal
Finance Management Bill which we have just passed  this  afternoon.  Perhaps
we should have dealt with this amendment first, just  for  the  purposes  of
logic.

Hon Deputy Chairperson, at present several sections  of  the  principal  Act
refer  to  relevant  municipal  finance  management  legislation.  With  the
passing of this Bill before us we will then be able to refer to  a  specific
piece of  legislation  with  some  major  degree  of  certainty.  Therefore,
sections 55 (2) (c); section 81 (2) (v) and  section  74  (1)  will  now  be
reader-friendly.

Hon members, among the amendments  contained  in  this  Bill  are  elaborate
measures to curb the so-called unfunded mandates  by  tightening  conditions
and undertakings which a Cabinet member or Deputy Minister must comply  with
before assigning any function or power to a municipality. Here we also  note
the involvement of the Financial and Fiscal Commission in  a  proactive  and
continuous manner. It will not only be visible during the hearings  for  the
division of revenue. These provisions will, hopefully,  go  a  long  way  in
reducing and eventually eliminating the  outcries  about  unfunded  mandates
imposed on local government.

During its deliberations on the Bill, the  select  committee  proposed  some
amendments to the Bill  passed  by  the  portfolio  committee.  Firstly,  we
proposed that the awarding of performance bonuses to the municipal  managers
and other managers reporting to municipal managers,  the  so-called  section
57 employees, be subjected to council scrutiny before payment.

During our oversight visits to some municipalities we became aware of  cases
where it seemed that managers in a municipality colluded to pay one  another
performance bonuses. Those bonuses were later questioned by  councillors  as
to whether those  managers  did,  in  the  first  place,  qualify  for  such
bonuses.

The second amendment  proposed  is  in  regard  to  the  role  of  municipal
representatives  in  the  shareholders'  meetings  convened   by   municipal
entities.  In  the  committee  some  coined  name  developed,  which  is  so
interesting that I dare not mention it in this Chamber. The committee is  of
the  view  that  active  but  limited   participation   of   the   municipal
representatives would  enhance  and  expedite  matters  in  the  meeting  of
shareholders.

The committee is, however, acutely aware that  such  shareholders'  meetings
are governed by principles of corporate  governance  as  prevailing  in  the
private sector.

Having observed this, we should concede, though, that a municipality has  an
overriding interest and accountability for  the  success  of  the  municipal
entity and, therefore, cannot be expected to sit around and not  participate
when these crucial  matters  are  discussed.  We  sincerely  hope  that  our
collegues  in  the  portfolio  committee  will  share  similar   views.   My
colleagues in the select committee will reflect  on  other  matters  on  the
Bill.

In conclusion, by passing this Bill, we will be going  a  long  way  towards
meeting one of our constitutional obligations outlined in section  154  (1).
Yes, of course, it is a tired quote; that is, ensuring  that  municipalities
are assisted in order to manage their own affairs, to exercise their  powers
and to perform their functions.

Lastly, Chairperson, may I express our  greatest  gratitude  to  the  senior
officials of the department who  went  beyond  the  call  of  official  duty
during the deliberations of this Bill. I also commend  this  Bill  for  your
approval, hon members, I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. I must,  before
I call the next speaker, say that your concern  with  regard  to  the  House
that has been depleted has been taken care  of  and  the  duty  whips  have,
actually, been informed accordingly.

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek wil graag  die  voorsitter  van  die  gekose
komitee bedank vir die rol wat hy in die hantering van  hierdie  wetsontwerp
gespeel het. Die wyse waarop hy vandag gedebatteer het, asook die  wysigings
wat ons in die gekose komitee aanvaar het, wys vir u dat  hy  met  toewyding
en onderskeiding sy taak  in  die  komitee  verrig,  en  deeglik  omsien  na
wetsontwerpe.

Weens die aard van  die  bepalings  van  die  "Local  Government:  Municipal
Finance Management Bill" wat ons nou net aanvaar het,  is  sekere  wysigings
aan dié wetsontwerp nodig.  'n  Besluit  is  geneem  dat  hierdie  wysigings
aangespreek moet word in 'n aparte wetsontwerp,  en  nie  as  deel  van  die
wetsontwerp wat ons goedgekeur het nie. Die wysigings word  dus  aangespreek
in die wetsontwerp voor ons.

Die implikasies  vir  munisipaliteite  is  onder  meer  dat  dit  effektiewe
regspersoonlikheidstelsels van staatsbestuur sal fasiliteer, die  uitvoering
van  toegewysde  funksies  en   bevoegdhede   sal   vereenvoudig,   en   ook
dienslewering   sal   fasiliteer   deur   bepalings   met   betrekking   tot
dienslewering, ooreenkomste en die daarstelling van munisipale identiteite.

Die Nuwe NP is gelukkig met die wysigings aangesien  dit  ook  die  rol  van
beamptes en raadslede vergemaklik  in  die  dag-tot-dag-bestuur  van  buite-
diensleweraars, wat sal toelaat dat dienste op 'n  besigheidsvlak  gehanteer
en verskaf word.

Die wetsontwerp maak ook voorsiening dat die  Kabinet  addisionele  funksies
en bevoegdhede aan munisipaliteite kan toewys. Dit is werklik 'n groot  stap
vorentoe om plaaslike bestuur op 'n  stelselmatige  en  natuurlike  wyse  te
ontwikkel. Munisipaliteite het ook die reg om, onder meer  riglyne  daar  te
stel   om   aangeleenthede   soos   tariefstrukture   te    reguleer.    Die
wysigingswetsontwerp maak ook verder  voorsiening  dat  die  munisipaliteite
jaarliks verslae moet voorlê oor hoe hulle presteer, en  in  dié  opsig  kan
ons ons funksie van oorsig ook werklik tot uitvoer bring.

Daar bestaan geen  twyfel  dat  dié  wysigingswetsontwerp  die  aansien  van
plaaslike bestuur bevorder nie, en die  betrokke  gemeenskappe  behoort  ook
baat te vind aangesien dienslewering aansienlik daardeur sal verbeter.

Die Nuwe NP  steun  dié  wetsontwerp.  Dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Chairperson, I would like to thank the chairperson  of  the
select committee for the role he played in dealing with this Bill.  The  way
in which he debated today, as well as the amendments that were  accepted  by
us in the select committee, demonstrates to you that he  executes  his  task
in the committee with dedication and distinction, and deals thoroughly  with
Bills.

As a result of the  nature  of  the  provisions  of  the  Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management  Bill  that  we  have  just  accepted,  certain
amendments to this Bill are necessary.  A  decision  was  taken  that  these
amendments should be addressed in a separate Bill, and not as  part  of  the
Bill that we have approved. Therefore the amendments are  addressed  in  the
Bill before us.

The implications for municipalities are that it will,  among  other  things,
facilitate effective corporate governance systems, streamline the  execution
of assigned functions and powers, and will also facilitate service  delivery
through  provisions  relating  to  service-delivery   agreements   and   the
establishment of municipal entities.

The New NP is pleased with the amendments in view of the fact that  it  also
facilitates  the  role  of  officials  and  councillors  in  the  day-to-day
management of external service providers, which  will  allow  that  services
are handled and provided on a business level.

The Bill also provides for the Cabinet to assign  additional  functions  and
powers to municipalities. It is really a major step  forward  in  developing
local government in a systematic and spontaneous  way.  Municipalities  also
have the right,  among  other  things,  to  create  guidelines  to  regulate
matters such as tariff structures. The amending Bill also  further  provides
for municipalities to present annual reports about  their  performance,  and
in this respect we can also really execute our function of oversight.

There is no doubt that this amending  Bill  promotes  the  esteem  of  local
government, and the communities concerned should also  benefit  seeing  that
service delivery will be improved by it considerably.

The New NP supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]]
Ms N C KONDLO: Deputy Chairperson, hon Deputy Minister, the ushering  in  of
developmental local government by the ANC-led Government  has  been  one  of
the most important backdrops of ensuring a  people-centred  service-delivery
approach by Government on issues that affect ordinary people  on  a  day-to-
day  basis,  for  the  betterment  of  their  lives.  The  Local  Government
Municipal Systems Amendment Bill provides, amongst  other  things,  for  the
establishment of municipal entities.

In the briefing by the department it was indicated that  from  the  research
the department had undertaken around municipal entities, it was  clear  that
municipalities  had  established  such  entities  without  any   guidelines,
regulations or laws governing this,  and  the  many  entities  that  are  in
existence are not  necessarily  geared  towards  service  delivery  for  our
people.

The department has a way of ensuring improved service delivery, as  well  as
entrenching accountability through this amendment,  and  allows  only  three
kinds of entities to be established by a municipality,  namely  the  private
companies established in terms of the Companies  Act;  the  service  utility
and the multijurisdictional service utility, both established in terms of  a
by-law.

The main features of these entities are that  when  established,  they  must
perform duties  and  functions  that  will  enhance  the  performance  of  a
municipality or municipalities in terms of their  powers  and  functions  as
set out in clause 8 of this Bill or section 5 of  the  Municipal  Structures
Act, or powers and functions assigned to them by the Constitution. The  Bill
states clearly that  these  entities  have  no  competence  to  perform  any
activity which falls outside of their functions  and  powers,  as  would  be
contained in the by-law for both  service  utility  and  multijurisdictional
service utility, as established. Most importantly, the  engagement  of  such
an entity must benefit the  local  communities,  and  the  onus  is  on  the
municipality to demonstrate this.

Once a municipality establishes an entity, it is referred  to  as  a  parent
municipality. I will not go into the  terminology  that  was  used  and  the
explanation that was given to us by the department, but I must say  that  it
was a hot debate in the committees.

Once any of these entities is  established  by  a  municipality,  there  are
lines  of  accountability  that  are  set   in   motion   for   the   parent
municipalities  to  ensure  adherence  thereto   by   entities.   A   parent
municipality has sole control over entities. It has  the  responsibility  to
ensure compliance with all laws that are applicable  to  their  functioning,
that is, the function of the entities.

It must also ensure that the annual performance  objectives  and  indicators
for the entity  are  contained  in  an  agreement  which  must  be  reviewed
annually, in which case, if the entity does not meet  its  obligations,  has
persistent financial  problems  and  is  not  able  to  impose  a  financial
recovery plan as was established or agreed, this Bill then  allows  for  the
possibility of the disestablishment of such an entity.
If two municipalities enter into such  agreements,  they  will  have  shared
control over the entity. They too, as parent municipalities, have  to  enter
into a mutual  agreement  regulating  a  whole  range  of  issues,  such  as
performance, payment of moneys due to the entity, or the  other  way  round,
and dispute resolution, up to the disestablishment of that  entity.  We  see
all these amendments as seeking to strengthen political  accountability,  as
well as the oversight role of councillors.

Ezi  zihlomelo  zinenjongo  yokuqinisekisa  ulawulo   oluluqilima,   ukususa
amakhwiniba   asenokuba   ngumqobo   kulawulo   loorhulumente   basemakhaya.
Kananjalo, zinenjongo yokuqinisekisa ukuvala amazibuko khon' ukuze  iinkonzo
ezimele ukuxhanyulwa luluntu zize ngokupheleleyo nangokucacileyo  ebantwini.
Loo  nto  iza  kwenza  ukuba  kungasoloko  kukho  isimbonono   esibonakalisa
ukungathembeki kwendlela ezisetyenziswa ngayo iimali  ezinikwa  oorhulumente
basemakhaya.

Ngala mazwi ambalwa ke,  ndithi  ngezi  zihlomelo,  uphuhliso  loluntu  luya
phambili. Sithi maz' enethole kweli sebe ngezi zihlomelo! Siyazixhasa  siyi-
ANC.  Ndiyabulela,  Sihlalo.   [Kwaqhwatywa.]   (Translation   of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[These amendments  are  aimed  at  ensuring  good  governance  and  removing
obstacles to good governance at local government  level.  Furthermore,  they
are aimed at ensuring that the services that are supposed to be  enjoyed  by
the communities  are  delivered.  That  will  remove  the  constant  grumble
indicative of the lack of confidence  in  the  manner  moneys  allocated  to
local government are spent.

In those few words, it is my view that with these amendments we  are  taking
forward the development of our people. We say thank you to  this  department
for these amendments. As the ANC, we support them, Chair. [Applause.]]

Me C BOTHA: Baie dankie, mnr die Voorsitter. As sy my toespraak gehoor  het,
sal my voorganger wel kan verstaan wat "'n paar woorde" beteken.

Die DA steun  hierdie  wetsontwerp  omdat  die  toepassing  meer  effektiewe
regering en beter finansiële bestuur  van  munisipaliteite  behoort  mee  te
bring.

Daar is nog voorgestelde wysigings afkomstig van die NVP wat  nog  voor  die
portefeuljekomitee sal dien, maar die DA bly by die  ondersteuning  van  die
oorspronklike  Nasionale  Vergadering-formulering.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: Thank you very much, Mr Chairman. If she had heard  my  speech,
my predecessor would have understood what is meant by "a few words".

The DA supports this Bill, because its  implementation  should  bring  about
more   effective   governance   and   better   financial    management    of
municipalities.

There further proposed amendments from the  National  Council  of  Provinces
that will be brought before the portfolio committee, but the DA stands  with
supporting the original formulation by the National Assembly. I  thank  you.
[Applause.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. Since there is no  law  that
says you must use all your time allocated, I will use Mr  Durr's  time  this
time. [Laughter.]

The commitment to public participation in the affairs  of  the  municipality
is  strengthened  and  made  more  visible  and  practical  in  this   Bill.
Municipalities are increasingly becoming aware that they will also  have  to
account as to how they interact with the community, as outlined  in  section
21 of the principal Act. The fact that local notices must also be  published
in the  provincial  Gazette,  ensures  that  there  is  oversight  over  the
communication function of the municipality by the provincial government.

Section 21  of  the  principal  Act  is  strengthened  by  stipulating  that
documents must be made public by displaying them in a conspicuous  place  in
all offices. A further innovation in these  amendments  is  the  requirement
that the municipality should also display these documents  on  its  official
website, if it does have one, and also indicate in the notice where  further
details can be obtained. If the municipality cannot afford to establish  its
own official website, it must arrange with  organised  local  government  to
display its notices.

As this Bill seeks to elaborate on the  governance  of  municipal  entities,
the transparency demands mentioned  earlier  are  attempts  to  prevent  the
advent of fly-by-night and other problems that may arise.

The external service provider may not change residence as it wishes.  Public
participation could be said to be a crucial  tool  to  enhance  transparency
and accountability on local governance. Participation does not  only  entail
attending report-back meetings or  work  committee  briefings,  and  is  not
confined to the discussion of annual reports. This Bill  demonstrates  these
facts by indicating clearly how the  ordinary  resident  and  businessperson
can  innovate  by  supporting  the  municipality  in  service  delivery   by
exploring the various options to deliver a certain service  which  has  been
agreed upon. This initiative clearly demonstrates the options  available  to
municipalities in dealing with the obligation of initiating  local  economic
development.

In conclusion, municipalities are required by section 46  of  the  principal
Act to  submit  annual  performance  reports.  The  amendment  is  that  the
performance of each external service provider should be  part  of  the  said
annual report and indicate whether the set targets have  been  met  or  not.
The ANC supports the amendments.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Thank  you,  Deputy
Chairperson.  Firstly,  I  would  like  to  thank  all   the   members   who
participated in this debate and I also  want  to  thank  all  the  political
parties for supporting this Bill.

The chairperson of the select committee referred to  the  representation  in
the shareholders' meetings. My understanding was that the contentious  issue
was around the representation in the board meetings and I  only  hope  that,
if that is the case, that issue will be resolved either way.

The  Deputy  Minister  of  Finance  referred   to   the   efforts   of   the
municipalities with regard to finance management, particularly  with  regard
to the collection of revenue, etc. However, I want to assure the House  that
municipalities are actively involved in implementing a programme  of  trying
to recover whatever outstanding debts there may be.  There  is  a  programme
that they are involved in, together with the assistance  of  the  provinces,
so there is that assistance that comes from provinces with regard  to  that,
as well as Salga.

Lastly, this Bill is in a way aimed at complementing  the  legislation  that
was debated just before this  -  The  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill. All of us do  agree,  of  course,  that  municipal  finance
management systems require urgent attention. I  do  not  disagree  with  the
Deputy Minister on that, but we think that that legislation  that  they  had
passed, which was before this House earlier, also will  go  a  long  way  in
addressing the challenges  that  municipalities  face.  Together  these  two
Bills will fortify the foundation  of  our  system  of  developmental  local
Government that we have started to grow. I would like to  thank  the  select
committee for the hard work they have put into this Bill, which has come  up
with a product that has been refined. Thank you very much.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have been advised  that  we  do  not
form a quorum. [Interjections.] ... Are you sure? ... Thank you  very  much.
I am reassured again that now we do have a quorum.

That concludes the debate. I shall now  put  the  question  that  the  Bill,
subject to proposed amendments, be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63,  I
shall first allow political parties to make their declarations of  vote,  if
they so wish. There is none. Those in favour say aye.

HON MEMBERS: Aye!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Those against say no.

HON MEMBERS: No!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  I  think  the  ayes  have  it.  The
majority of the members have voted in favour. I declare  the  Bill,  subject
to  proposed  amendments,  agreed  to  in  terms  of  section  75   of   the
Constitution. [Applause.]

                    PENSIONS SECOND (SUPPLEMENTARY) BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Deputy Chair, the Select Committee on  Finance  met  on  18
November 2003 to consider all pieces of legislation that were put before  it
and, amongst others, to approve the Pensions  Second  (Supplementary)  Bill.
The Bill was considered by the National  Assembly's  Standing  Committee  on
Private  Members'  Legislative  Proposals   and   Special   Petitions,   and
subsequently presented to the National Assembly for approval.  The  National
Assembly, as a House, approved this Bill. Therefore,  the  select  committee
considered all those factors and took them  into  account  when  making  its
decision.

I would like to report to the House that the Bill was brought to the  select
committee. Let me just  take  the  House  back  to  1998.  When  I  came  to
Parliament, one of the pieces of legislation that we  were  confronted  with
was the piece of legislation that asked Parliament to  give  powers  to  the
National Treasury - then part of the Department of Finance - to  charge  the
National  Revenue  Fund  a  certain  amount  to  be  paid  to   Mrs   Botha.
[Interjections.] No, no, not your relative,  Sandra;  that  is  another  Mrs
Botha.

So, in 1998 we rejected that Bill on the grounds that by  approving  it,  we
would be  setting  a  precedent  that  everybody  else  -  people  who  were
disgruntled one way or the other with the previous Public Service  or  civil
service - would therefore open up and wake up to  the  realisation  that  if
they petitioned Parliament, they would be granted such additional  pensions.
We,  therefore,  rejected  the  Bill  on  those  grounds,  including  having
considered that the National Treasury -  at  that  time  the  Department  of
Finance - was opposed or is still opposed to this kind of  arrangement.  The
committee considered all that and the historical context that  I  have  just
given.

The committee then took a decision that we could not approve this  piece  of
legislation which, in simple terms, wants  to  make  the  National  Treasury
charge the National Revenue Fund an amount of  approximately  R2  200  which
will be given to  Mrs  Botha  for  having  served  in  the  previous  Public
Service. The committee is of the view that we will be  setting  a  precedent
if we grant this amount to Mrs Botha because, in future, we  cannot  say  no
to other people. Therefore, it is appropriate that we  reject  this  request
which has been approved by the National Assembly in  particular,  and  which
was brought to  its  Standing  Committee  on  Private  Members'  Legislative
Proposals and Special Petitions.

We are not doing this because we are not concerned  or  not  sympathetic  to
the issues and circumstances that Mrs Botha is in, but we are  of  the  view
that, in principle, we cannot just approve such  things  because  in  future
they are going  to  create  problems,  particularly  with  all  the  immense
challenges we have. We have many people in South Africa  who  are  poor  and
who do not even have the amount of money that Mrs Botha gets,  and  who  are
able to survive on a daily basis. So, we think that it's inappropriate  that
Mrs Botha must be paid this amount. Therefore, the committee  proposes  that
the Bill be rejected. [Interjections.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I don't know who Mrs Botha is.  I  have  never  met
her, but I would like to say that according to our colleagues in  the  other
place, this lady apparently was a nurse who worked amongst  the  poorest  of
the poor for 27 years and has not received her  pension.  She  has  a  small
grant of R14 000 which she received in the 1980s, I think.

She has spent years petitioning this House, and her petition has been  heard
by the petitions committee  of  our  colleagues  in  the  other  place.  Our
colleagues in the other place, a multiparty  committee,  have  decided  that
this lady is deserving of this pension, and they have come to us purely  for
authorisation of the additional pension granted in order  for  the  transfer
to take place.

If we were dealing with the merits of the case,  then  we  should  at  least
hear  the  representations.  We  cannot  reject  recommendations  from   our
colleagues in the other House without looking at the  merits  of  the  case,
which we have never had before us. None of us have  seen  the  case  of  Mrs
Botha or had Mrs Botha before us.

On the question of the precedent, we have had precedents since  1913.  There
have been 84 precedents  since  1913.  This  is  a  right  that  parliaments
maintain for themselves. The fact of the matter is that we have  established
no precedent. It's an ad hoc right we have; it's the exception  that  proves
the rule. I would have thought that either we should  approve  it  and  have
the milk of human kindness to do so, or at least show our colleagues in  the
other place the courtesy of listening to the  arguments  which  were  before
them before we reject such a case.

I can mention a lot of precedents. Many ANC  cadres  have  received  special
pensions that we voted for. That is fine. There is nothing wrong with  that.
I'm not criticising it. I am just saying that there are many precedents  ...
[Interjections.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: On a point of order, Chair ...

Mr K D S DURR: There are many precedents. I don't know whether this lady  is
black, white or brown. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Sorry, hon member!

Mr K D S DURR: All I know is that she has done a huge public  service  which
our people in  the  other  place,  who  have  evaluated  her,  have  thought
deserving.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: On a point of order ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Durr!

Mr K D S DURR: And I want to support that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member!

Mr K D S DURR: I call upon the members of this House to  have  a  free  vote
and we should vote for Mrs Botha. I thank you. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Durr! I  have  been  calling  upon
you for a very long time to stop and listen to the point of order.  I  don't
know whether you heard that or not. However, in any case, you have  finished
now.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, on a point of order: Can I ask  that  we  should
have a free vote on this matter in this House?

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Dr E A CONROY: Agb Voorsitter, daar word voorsiening gemaak dat  kiesers  of
LP's die Parlement kan nader met  'n  petisie  vir  hulp  in  die  vorm  van
wetgewing en dat die Parlement aan hierdie beginsel uitvoering moet gee.

In hierdie betrokke geval is die petisie  deur  die  agb  Francois  Beukman,
Nuwe NP-LP en  voorsitter  van  die  Staande  Komitee:  Openbare  Rekeninge,
ingedien namens Mev Mercia Botha wat ernstig deur die vorige  regering  voor
1994 ten opsigte  van  pensioenreëlings  benadeel  was.  Die  doel  van  die
petisie was om hierdie onreg reg te stel.

Die petisie deur agb Beukman is ná 'n lang proses van voorleggings  eenparig
deur die  Nasionale  Vergadering  se  Staande  Komitee  oor  Privaatlede  se
Wetgewende Voorstelle en Spesiale Petisies  en  die  Portefeuljekomitee  oor
Finansies aanvaar. Die wetgewing wat hiervoor voorsiening maak, is ook  deur
die Kabinet goedgekeur.

Die agb Beukman het trouens ook  die  agb  Minister  van  Finansies  in  die
openbaar bedank vir sy rol om die wetgewing deur die Kabinet te voer.

Die Nuwe NP se gevoel is dat  die  Parlement  duidelik  moet  toon  dat  die
Parlement toeganklik is, dat verontregte persone aangehoor sal word  en  dat
oplossings wel beskikbaar is.

Die Nuwe NP stem dus vir die aanvaarding van die wetsontwerp.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I would like you to note that  the  chairman  of
the select committee voted for this legislation.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a point of order: I ask for a  division,
as there is some confusion.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: But there was no confusion, actually.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I ask for a division, Sir.

Division demanded.

Mr K D S DURR: Mr Chairman, may I address you? Because this is a  matter  of
an individual and not a party matter, may I please request  that  the  Whips
withdraw themselves from this debate and allow the members a  free  vote  in
this division. Thank you. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: What?

Mr K D S DURR: I request that  members  be  allowed  a  free  vote  in  this
division.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mr Durr, I don't understand that.

During division:

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Hon Chair, is lobbying allowed in the House, such  as  Mr
Lever is doing? That is intimidation. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP  OF  THE  COUNCIL:  Deputy  Chairperson,  with  the  greatest
respect ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Order! Please.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: With the greatest respect, the  Whippery  was
directed to count and to assist the Chair in counting,  not  to  approach  a
member to convince or lobby a member to vote in a particular  way.  I  think
that that is absolutely irregular. The hon member Vilakazi inquired from  me
as to where she should sit if she were to abstain. I  approached  the  Table
and the Table indicated  to  me  that  she  should  sit  where  she  was.  I
indicated that to her. I cannot understand how she could, after having  been
approached by the hon Lever, now change her mind about the matter.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, Chief Whip.  Order!  Order!
Order! Please. Hon members, please! Mrs Vilakazi, I am sure  that  you  have
heard what the Chief Whip has said. Could you perhaps  clarify  whether  you
abstain ...

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: I am voting. I have changed my mind.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Seemingly, she is also  voting.  Thank
you. Would you be kind enough to sit down, please. The House is in  session.
Yes, Mr Lever?

Mr L G LEVER: The Chief Whip has indicated that  he  considers  what  I  did
irregular. I think I should at least be allowed  an  opportunity  to  answer
that, in the circumstances.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: OK. I want to know  how  many  members
you have right now.

The Council divided:

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be agreed to.

Division demanded.

The Council divided:


  AYES - 10: Permanent delegates: Ackermann, C; Botha, C-S;  Conroy,  E  A;
  Durr, K D S; Lever, L G; Matthee, P A; Sono, B  N;  Tlhagale,  J  O;  Van
  Niekerk, A E; Vilakazi, J N.

  Sogoni, H T; Sulliman, M A; Surty, M E; Themba, M P; Thomson, B; Tolo,  B
  J; Windvoël, V V Z.

Question not agreed to.

Bill accordingly rejected.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Hon  Presiding  Officer,  I  am  rising  a  very  serious
concern. During the debate when Mr  Durr  was  requested  by  the  Presiding
Officer to take a seat because the hon Mahlangu was rising  on  a  point  of
order, there was a great show of disregard and disrespect for the  Presiding
Officer, which one didn't expect, for that matter,  from  a  man  who  comes
from the ACDP - the party which upholds Christian values.

I think that matter can set a very wrong precedent that a Presiding  Officer
will not be listened to and his rulings not adhered to when he  instructs  a
member to take a seat.

It is my view that  the  hon  member  responsible  for  such  action  should
apologise. Thank you.
Mr K D S DURR: Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  apologise  in  respect  of  that.
[Applause.]

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SC ON FINANCE ON AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
 GOVERNMENT OF THE RSA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA FOR THE
    AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION IN
                         RESPECT OF TAXES ON INCOME

Mr Z S KOLWENI:  Thank  you,  Deputy  Chairperson,  the  Government  of  the
Republic of South Africa and the  government  of  the  Republic  of  Rwanda,
desiring to promote and strengthen the economic relations  between  the  two
countries, have developed this framework to facilitate avoidance  of  double
taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. Furthermore,  this  agreement
shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of  the  contracting
states.

Whereas a range  of  issues  pertaining  to  economic  activities  has  been
elaborated upon in detail, where you find a  variety  of  articles  such  as
business profits out of enterprises and taxation patterns, to mention but  a
few.

The report goes further to touch on shipping and air  transport  operations.
Hence everything  is  centred  around  people-to-people  and  state-to-state
relations. Articles 10, 11, 12 and 20 provide us with  in-depth  information
in respect of business interests, royalties and dividends.

Further, the report covers the aspect of students, apprentices  or  business
trainees who are present in a  contracting  state  solely  for  purposes  of
their education or training.

Finally, the entire agreement becomes part of the law of  South  Africa  and
is entered into in terms of section 108 of the Income Tax  Act  of  1962.  I
move that this House accept this agreement. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you.  I  shall  now  put  the
question in respect of the 5th Order, the question being that the report  be
agreed to. As the decision is dealt with in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution, I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. I hope that they  are
all in. It seems as if they are all in. In accordance with Rule 72, I  shall
first allow provinces the opportunity to make declarations of vote, if  they
so wish. There is none.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the question, and we shall do this  in
alphabetical order, per province. Delegation heads must please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against, or  abstain  from  voting.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  All  nine  provinces  have  voted  in

Constitution.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SC ON FINANCE ON AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
  GOVERNMENT OF THE RSA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA FOR
  THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION IN
                         RESPECT OF TAXES ON INCOME

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Chairperson, once again, the  objectives  of  the  agreement
are to avoid double taxation. There is, however, one difference between  the
agreements between South Africa and Rwanda, and South Africa  and  Botswana.
The Botswana government has insisted that a  clause  be  inserted  to  allow
either South Africa or  Botswana  to  charge  tax  on  profits  of  material
enterprise - that is an enterprise involved in the business of mining  -  at
a rate different  from  the  rate  charged  on  the  profits  of  any  other
enterprise.

Internal domestic law gives the Botswana Minister of Finance  the  right  to
negotiate such agreements  with  companies,  and  this  does  not  adversely
affect the terms of the convention. South Africa also  applies  a  different
tax rate to its gold mining companies.

Furthermore, article 28, which is about bringing the agreement  into  force,
provides that the contracting states shall notify each other once the  legal
procedures required in each country for bringing the convention  into  force
have been completed. The convention will then come into force  on  the  date
of receipt of the later of these notifications.

Finally, the entire convention becomes part of the law of South  Africa  and
is entered into in terms of section 108 of the Income Tax Act. I  move  that
this House adopts this agreement. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  I  shall  now  put  the  question  in
respect of the sixth Order. The question is that the report  be  agreed  to.
As the decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I
shall first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are present in  order
to cast their provinces' votes. They are all in.  Then  in  accordance  with
Rule 73, I shall  first  allow  provinces  the  opportunity  to  make  their
declarations of vote, if they so wish. It seems there is none.

We shall now proceed to the voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order, per province. Delegation heads must please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against, or  abstain  from  voting.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - AGREEMENT BETWEEN
  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
  SULTANATE OF OMAN FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION
               OF FISCAL EVASION IN RESPECT OF TAXES ON INCOME

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - AGREEMENT BETWEEN
  THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE
 REPUBLIC OF BELARUS FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION AND THE PREVENTION
  OF FISCAL EVASION IN RESPECT OF TAXES ON INCOME AND ON CAPITAL (PROPERTY)

 CONSIDERATION OF THE REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - CONVENTION
  BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE GOVERNMENT
  OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION
     AND THE PREVENTION OF FISCAL EVASION IN RESPECT OF TAXES ON INCOME
Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I'm aware that I am  probably  setting  an  ACDP
record for speaking time this afternoon. [Laughter.] It is my  privilege  on
behalf of the committee to deal with the three double taxation  conventions,
namely, Oman, Belarus and Brazil.

The agreements reflect the growing integration  of  South  Africa  into  the
world community and the deepening of our  diplomatic,  trade  and  financial
relations. They also reflect  the  growing  pattern  of  movement  of  South
African professionals working abroad. They also reflect, or anticipate,  the
growing interaction  and  investment  in  South  Africa  and  the  different
regions of the world before us. All of this holds up much  promise  for  the
future.

The Oman agreement, the first agreement I will deal  with,  is  between  the
Government of the Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the  government  of  the
Sultanate of Oman, and it is for the avoidance of double  taxation  and  the
prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income. The Gulf is  a
major trading area and a  growing  market  for  us.  Oman  is  an  important
country in that  area.  Oman  is  a  major  capital  exporter  with  a  long
tradition of trading in the Indian Ocean region.  It  is  a  member  of  the
Indian Ocean Rim grouping of states.

It may interest members to know that it was the great Sultan of  Oman,  many
hundreds of years ago, who gave his name to Mozambique. His name  was  Mussa
Ben Mbiki, which is where  Mozambique  derives  its  name  from.  They  have
traded in the Indian Ocean for a very long time, and  they  are  interacting
with us now on the Indian Ocean Rim.

As a country, we are  focusing  on  the  Gulf  states,  some  of  which  are
attempting  to  become  economic  hubs  in  the  region.  Our   construction
companies are very active in the region, and large numbers of South  African
professionals have been and are being recruited to work in the area. We  can
expect to conclude this agreement and others like it in the  region  in  the
future. They are of much more  than  simply  bilateral  political  interest.
They affect the lives and livelihoods of our people.

We  have  good  relations  with  Oman,  and  this  will   strengthen   those
relationships further. Of particular  interest  is  that  they  are  in  the
process of tax harmonisation, and that clause 3(1) of the  protocol  permits
them the breathing space to treat local and branches  of  foreign  companies
similarly. So, I move that agreement.

Regarding the agreement on Belarus, the second  on  the  Order  Paper,  this
again  reflects  our  growing  interaction  with  the  former  Eastern  bloc
country. Belarus is situated on the Baltic Coast, and as such  finds  itself
on the Baltic Rim, one of the world's fastest growing  and  richest  markets
which, I believe, is doing something like 15% of world trade.

The Baltic, which divided people at the time of the  Cold  War,  now  unites
everyone on its rim. We have ratified a treaty with the Russian  Federation,
and we are currently negotiating with Estonia, Latvia  and  Luthuania,  also
just north on the rim. We signed an agreement  with  Finland  in  1995.  The
area has huge potential growth for us as South Africans.
Of specific  interest  may  be  that  the  agreement  specifically  excludes
federalism. This reflects the nature of the Belarus constitution, and  their
sentiments are thus contained in  article  1  of  the  protocol.  Article  2
reflects the fact that they do not have a concept of usufruct  of  immovable
property, as we have, so  that  is  excluded.  Here  again  we  see  growing
relations and potential for future growth in an important area, and  I  move
this agreement.

The third agreement I have the pleasure of  moving  is  the  one  negotiated
specifically between South Africa and the Federative Republic of Brazil.  As
with others, this agreement closely follows the OECD model.

The interesting thing is that  South  America  has  been  somewhat  inwardly
focused as far as taxation systems are concerned. As we know, Brazil is  one
of the great markets of the  world.  I  think  she  has  the  tenth  biggest
economy in the world now. She is trying to expand her tax treaties with  the
world, just as we are.
Members have read the agreements and  the  excellent  explanatory  memoranda
that have been made available to us by the Department of Finance,  and  that
have been motivated to us in the select committee. So, I will not deal  with
all 30 of the articles of the agreement.

However, article 4 of the protocol, as  a  most-favoured-nation  clause,  is
interesting and worthy of note,  namely,  that  should  Brazil  subsequently
conclude a convention for the avoidance of  double  taxation  with  a  third
state which is not located in South America, as  far  as  capital  gains  is
concerned, then that similar treatment will automatically  apply  to  us  in
respect of the convention.

The President of Brazil has only recently visited our country. I think  this
agreement with them was signed in principle - that which  we  are  asked  to
ratify today - on 8  November  when  we  signed  the  agreement.  Brazil  is
clearly interested in expanding her trade and influence in Africa,  just  as
we in South  Africa  seek  to  extend  our  reach  in  South  America.  This
agreement reflects all of those good  things,  and  I  therefore  move  that
agreement.

All that remains for me to say is  that  we  in  this  House  welcome  these
agreements, and our congratulations go out to the parties concerned.  It  is
always wonderful to make  new  friends  in  the  world  and  to  deepen  our
friendships.  The  more  we  do  that,  the   better   for   us   all.   Our
congratulations and thanks go to the Sars - the SA Revenue Service - to  the
Treasury and the Department of Foreign Affairs and their officials  for  the
work that has been done to bring us this far. I move these  agreements  that
are before the House today. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, Mr Durr. I am sure  it  was
the first time, and probably the last time, that you have spoken for such  a
long time in the Chamber. [Laughter.]

I shall now put the question in respect of the Seventh Order.  The  question
is that the report be agreed to. As this decision is dealt with in terms  of
section 65 of the Constitution, I shall  first  ascertain  whether  all  the
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
It seems that they are all in. In accordance with Rule  71,  I  shall  first
allow provinces the opportunity to make their declarations of vote, if  they
so wish. There is none. We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.
 I shall do so in alphabetical order, per  province.  The  delegation  heads
must please indicate to the Chair whether they vote in  favour  or  against,
or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?

I shall now put the question in respect of the  Ninth  Order,  the  question
being that the report be agreed to. Order! As the decision is dealt with  in

the delegation heads are present in the Chamber  to  cast  their  provinces'
votes.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations, if they so  wish.  Hon  members,  I  don't  know
whether you want us to continue or  not,  because  I  don't  think  you  are
hearing what the Chair is saying here. If you could please listen  to  this,
you know.

Ms B N SONO: Chairperson, I was rising on a point of  concern.  I  am  being
harassed by  these  members.  They  are  not  even  listening  to  what  the
Chairperson is saying. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. We  shall  now  proceed  to
the voting on the question.  I  shall  do  so  in  alphabetical  order,  per

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Nine provinces have voted  in  favour.
I therefore declare the report agreed to. [Applause.]

I would now like to call upon the hon Deputy Chairperson,  Mr  Mahlangu.  As
requested, he would like to make a statement on  the  work  of  the  working
group on the OAU. I therefore call upon the Deputy Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  in  the
8th report which was tabled in the House, we reported that 21 member  states
had deposited their instruments of  ratification.  Today  I  am  pleased  to
announce  that  24  member  states  have  deposited  their  instruments   of
ratification. Senegal actually deposited last  week,  but  there  are  still
many other countries that will do so.

This means that we have finally achieved the  required  simple  majority  of
member  states  for  the  protocol  to  come  into  force.  Our  journey  to
realisation of the continental parliament is now a reality. What we need  to
work on is ensuring that we are ready  to  participate  in  the  Pan-African
Parliament. I am saying this because when we delivered the  8th  report,  we
indicated that there is still a lot of work that needs to be done.

Amongst some of the issues which we will still  have  to  finalise  are  the
following: composition of the South African delegation;  procedure  for  the
election of the South African delegation; procedure for the election of  the
president and the four vice-presidents; and how  do  we  ensure  that  South
African delegates are held accountable, and also develop mechanisms for  the
structures  for  holding  our  delegates  to  the   Pan-African   Parliament
accountable.

Now, let me begin with the first one, that is the composition of  the  South
African delegation. As hon members are aware,  the  protocol  provides  that
each  country  will  be  represented  by  five  members.  Furthermore,   the
delegation must  include  one  woman  and  be  a  reflection  of  a  diverse
political composition of parliament. In our last report,  we  reported  that
the working group had recommended that South Africa would be represented  by
at least three women out of five members. I  should  also  report  that  the
working group had, in principle, agreed that in order  to  ensure  that  the
South African delegation reflects the diversity of political  opinions,  the
majority party would be represented by  three  members  and  the  opposition
parties by two members.

However, the challenge that we still have to  deal  with  is,  ``How  do  we
ensure that the three women in the delegation also reflect the diversity  of
political opinions within Parliament?''  It  has  been  suggested  that  the
majority party will nominate two women and that the opposition party  should
also at least nominate one woman and therefore that shows the  diversity  in
terms of politics.

The second issue is the procedure. I  should  also  report  that  the  South
African delegation will consist of four members from the  National  Assembly
and one member from the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  As  members  are
aware, we do not have  provisions  that  allow  the  two  Houses  to  decide
jointly. It is therefore imperative that each House meets to elect the  five
delegates. Presiding Officers have agreed that both Houses should elect  the
five delegates on Wednesday 26 November 2003, that  will  be  the  Wednesday
before we rise for the festive season.

The protocol, in terms of the election of a presiding officer  or  what  you
call president and the four vice-presidents, provides that at its  inaugural
session, the Pan-African Parliament should  elect  the  president  and  four
vice-presidents who represent the five  regions  of  Africa.  These  regions
should not be mistaken with the economic blocks, as we know them today.

In terms of the OAU resolution, Africa has been divided into  five  regions,
namely West Africa, with six member states; North Africa, with  five  member
states; East Africa, with  13  member  states;  Central  Africa,  with  nine
member states; and Southern Africa, with 10 member states. So those are  the
five regions of the African Union.

The question to be  finally  resolved  is  whether  those  members  who  are
elected to serve in the presidency and vice-presidency  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament should be replaced by other members  from  their  countries  once
elected, or would they continue  to  represent  their  countries?  That's  a
question that we still have to debate and agree on. These are  some  of  the
challenges that all political parties should start to apply their minds  to.


It is the view of the working group  that  the  elected  presiding  officers
should represent the interest of the Pan-African Parliament  and,  as  such,
the interests of the African continent. The question of  our  accountability
also arises in  terms  of  our  delegation,  especially.  Now,  this  is  an
important aspect as to how  do  we  ensure  that  the  delegation  that  our
Parliament  will  be  sending  to  the  Pan-African   Parliament   will   be
accountable, taking into account that in terms of the protocol they will  be
voting in their personal and independent capacity?

The working group has resolved that a joint ad hoc committee be  established
to prepare the members who will  be  going  to  the  Pan-African  Parliament
which would be followed by a  permanent  structure  that  will  ensure  that
members who represent our  Parliament  to  the  Pan-African  Parliament  are
accountable. Now, that permanent structure would deal with the  question  of
the mandates and reporting back, so that those mandates  are  being  checked
thoroughly as people are going there to represent the country, and  so  that
they are clear about the mandate that they get from our Parliament.

Now, in order to avoid the disruption of the  working  group,  it  has  been
proposed that the working group would cease to exist once the joint  ad  hoc
committee is established. Once a permanent structure is  established,  after
the inauguration, the ad hoc committee would also cease to function  and  it
would then be replaced by a permanent structure.

In  conclusion,  owing  to  the  historic  importance  of  the   Pan-African
Parliament, it has been agreed that its first inauguration would be held  at
the headquarters of the African Union, that is Addis Ababa in Ethiopia,  and
this will happen towards the end of January 2004. In order  to  ensure  that
all delegates  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  meet  the  requirements  as
outlined in the protocol, an accreditation  committee  will  be  set  up  to
ensure that  member  states  send  delegates  who  comply  with  gender  and
political diversity, and also that no member of the executive forms part  of
the parliamentary delegation.

Lastly, let me take this opportunity to inform members that a report of  the
working group is tabled on the ATCs today, and that all  members  are  urged
to find time to read this report. We invite  you  for  Monday  afternoon,  3
o'clock, to fully brief you  and  have  a  discussion,  as  members  of  the
Council, on the issues that are before the working group so that when we  go
to the working group, we would  also  have  had  some  idea  of  what  other
members think. That input will assist us to  take  decisions  as  a  working
group when we meet. We will be meeting again on Tuesday next week.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  Thank  you   very   much,   Deputy
Chairperson, for that  important  statement  and  briefing  on  the  working
group's report. I hope members will attend the meeting on Monday afternoon.

The Council adjourned at 16:43.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:
National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of
     Life and Status of Women, dated 26 September 2003:


         The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of  Quality  of  Life
         and  Status  of  Women,  having  considered  the   Report  of   the
         Independent Experts' Assessment on Women, War and  Peace  (UNIFEM),
         reports that it endorses  the  recommendations  contained  in  that
         Report, in particular the following:


         1. The Secretary-General of the UN to give  priority  to  achieving
              gender parity in his appointments of  Special  Representatives
              and Envoys beginning with the minimum of 30% in the next three
              years with a view to gender parity by 2015.


         2. Gender  equality  to  be  recognised  in  all  peace  processes,
              agreements  and  transitional  governance  structures  with  a
              minimum of 30% representation of women in all negotiations.


         3. Establishment of a United Nations Trust Fund for Women's  Peace-
              Building.  The  fund  must  be  used  to  leverage  political,
              financial and  technical  support  needed  for  women's  civil
              society organisations and women leaders to have an  impact  on
              peace efforts. The  Fund  should  be  managed  by  UNIFEM,  in
              consultation with other UN agencies.


         4. UNIFEM and the Department of Political Affairs (DPA)  to  ensure
              that  gender  issues  and  women's  full   participation   are
              incorporated    in    peace-building     and     post-conflict
              reconstruction. UNIFEM and UN Population Fund  (UNFPA)  to  be
              represented in all relevant inter-agency bodies.
         5. Peace Negotiations and agreements to have a  gender  perspective
              through  the  full  integration  of   women's   concerns   and
              participation in peace processes.


         6. UN and donors to invest in women's organisations as  a  strategy
              for conflict prevention, resolution and  peace-building.  They
              should exercise flexibility in  responding  to  urgent  needs,
              time-sensitive  opportunities,  and  foster  partnerships  and
              networks  between  international,  regional  and  local  peace
              initiatives.


         7. National electoral laws and international  electoral  assistance
              to establish quotas to achieve  gender  parity,  ensure  voter
              registration, education and increase in the ratio of women  in
              electoral commissions and observer  missions  and  to  provide
              training for women candidates.


         8. A lead organisation to be designated within the  United  Nations
              for women's education  and  training  in  conflict  and  post-
              conflict situations. This  lead  organisation,  together  with
              UNESCO, UNHCR and UNICEF, should  ensure  that  all  education
              programmes for displaced persons provide for women, as well as
              girls.


         9.  The  International  Labour   Organization   (ILO)   to   expand
              vocational and skills  training  for  women  in  post-conflict
              situations, including in non-traditional, public  and  private
              sectors, in a manner that is sustainable and responsive to the
              local and national economy.
         Additional recommendations by Committee:


         1. That a regional TRC  structure  on  violence  against  women  in
              armed conflict for women in Africa be established  within  the
              African Union and that it be linked to the International Truth
              and Reconciliation Commission on  violence  against  women  in
              armed conflict under the United Nations, as  proposed  in  the
              UNIFEM  report,  as  a  step  towards  ending  impunity.   The
              continental  structure  should,   however,   model   a   joint
              government and civil society initiative.


         2. Further, decreasing domestic  violence  should  be  a  criterium
              against which countries will be reviewed in the  African  Peer
              Review Mechanism process.


         3. That a Council  for  African  women  mediators  be  established,
              comprising women who are not in active formal politics and who
              will be available and who may be utilised  as  special  envoys
              and who, as a council, will have a  special  status  with  the
              Peace and Security Council.
         4. That training workshops be facilitated  for  empowering  African
              women  with  conflict  analysis,  negotiation,  mediation  and
              leadership skills.


         5.  That  relations  with  the   DRC,   Rwanda   and   Burundi   be
              strengthened.


         6. That a delegation of women leaders be sent to  Burundi  and  the
              DRC to work towards facilitating lasting peace.


         7. That a mission of three women leaders from  each  of  the  Great
              Lakes countries and South Africa  be  constituted  to  support
              international efforts for  establishing  peace  in  the  Great
              Lakes Region.


         8. That the Peace and Security Council  of  the  African  Union  be
              engendered with immediate effect.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Mediation Committee on the Liquor Bill [B 23B and B  23D
     - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76), dated 19 November 2003:


         The Mediation Committee, having considered the Liquor Bill  [B  23B
         and B 23D - 2003] (National Assembly - sec  76),  as  well  as  the
         papers referred to it, reports as follows:


         1. The Liquor Bill [B 23B - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76)  was
              passed  by  the  National  Assembly  on  21  August  2003  and
              submitted to the National Council of Provinces for approval.


         2. The National Council of Provinces passed the Liquor Bill [B  23D
              - 2003] (National Assembly -  sec  76)  on   8  October  2003,
              containing a number of amendments  agreed  to  by  the  Select
              Committee on Economic and Foreign Affairs.


         3. Upon referral  of  the  latter  amended  Bill  to  the  National
              Assembly, that House accepted some of the amendments passed by
              the National Council  of  Provinces,  with  the  exception  of
              Clause 6(2) of the Bill. Consequently, the  National  Assembly
              rejected the Bill.


         4. The Bill was referred to the Mediation Committee on 18  November
              2003 in terms of Joint Rule 186(1)(b) of the  Joint  Rules  of
              Parliament. The Mediation Committee met on 19  November  2003,
              and, after deliberation, agreed to submit another  version  of
              the Bill.


         5. The effect of this decision is that the Secretary to  Parliament
              is required to submit the latter version of the Bill  to  both
              the Speaker and the Chairperson of the  Council  in  terms  of
              Joint Rule 188(3), for consideration  by  the  House  and  the
              Council.


         6. The Committee therefore submits the Liquor Bill [B 23F  -  2003]
              (National Assembly - sec 76), and recommends  that  the  House
              and the Council pass this mediated version.

2.    Report of the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on  Intelligence,  dated  5
     November 2003:


         The Joint Standing Committee  on  Intelligence,  having  met  on  5
         November 2003, wishes to report as follows:


              The  Committee  welcomes  the   appointment   of   the   Hefer
              Commission.


              However, the Committee views with alarm  and  serious  concern
              the issuing of subpoenas by  the  Hefer  Commission  to  South
              Africa's Intelligence and Security Services compelling them to
              provide classified  and/or  sensitive  information  that  will
              purportedly  serve  the  Commission's  purpose.  Ignoring  the
              provisions of the law relating to national security  in  order
              to satisfy the objectives of the Hefer  Commission  will  have
              serious consequences for South Africa, both  domestically  and
              internationally.


              The role of the Committee, amongst other things, is to  ensure
              that South Africas' Intelligence and Security Services protect
              and preserve the country's national security, the  defence  of
              the Republic and the investigation, combating of crime and the
              protection of classified and/or sensitive information in their
              possession.  It  is  a  universally  accepted  principle  that
              information in the possession  of  the  Intelligence  Services
              cannot be made public. This includes especially the  names  of
              sources, agents, operatives and identities of members.


              The  Committee  therefore  supports  the   position   of   the
              Intelligence Services as presented to the Hefer Commission.


              We believe that the Intelligence and Security Services  should
              not be embroiled in  this  matter  and  that  those  who  have
              brought the matter into the public domain, should provide  the
              basis for their allegations to be  tested  by  the  Commission
              without causing databases and files of  the  Intelligence  and
              Security Services  to  be  inspected  at  great  risk  to  the
              Constitutional mandate of these structures.

National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs
     on the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime,
     dated 19 November 2003:


         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,
         having considered the request for approval  by  Parliament  of  the
         United Nations Convention against  Transnational  Organised  Crime,
         referred to it, recommends that the Council -


         1. approve the said Convention in terms of section  231(2)  of  the
              Constitution;


         2. confirm that the Director-General of the Department  of  Justice
              and Constitutional Development, to whom foreign  requests  for
              assistance in terms of section  7  of  the  International  Co-
              operation in Criminal Matters Act, 1996 (Act No. 75 of  1996),
              is submitted, be  designated  as  the  South  African  Central
              Authority to receive requests for mutual legal  assistance  in
              terms of  article  18(13)  of  the  Convention.  In  addition,
              approve that requests shall be made in the English language as
              provided for in article 18(14) of the Convention; and


         3. approve that the Republic of South  Africa,  in  line  with  her
              previous position, when ratifying United Nations  multilateral
              treaties,  enter  a   reservation   against   the   compulsory
              jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ)  with
              regard  to  settlement  of  disputes  arising   out   of   the
              interpretation or application of the  Convention  as  provided
              for in article 35(3) of the Convention. The Republic of  South
              Africa does not recognise the compulsory jurisdiction  of  the
              ICJ as provided for in article 36 of the Statute of the ICJ.
              The reservation, in line with  our  previous  position  stated
              above, has been formulated as follows:


                  "Pending a decision by the Government of the  Republic  of
                  South  Africa  on  the  compulsory  jurisdiction  of   the
                  International Court of  Justice,  the  Government  of  the
                  Republic does not consider itself bound by  the  terms  of
                  article 35(2) of the Convention  which  provides  for  the
                  compulsory jurisdiction  of  the  International  Court  of
                  Justice in differences arising out of  the  interpretation
                  or  application  of  the  Convention.  The  Republic  will
                  adhere to the position  that,  for  the  submission  of  a
                  particular dispute for  settlement  by  the  International
                  Court, the consent of all the parties to  the  dispute  is
                  required in every individual case."

         recommends that the Council -


         1. approve the said Protocol in terms  of  section  231(2)  of  the
              Constitution; and


         2. approve that the Republic of South  Africa,  in  line  with  her

              interpretation or application of the Protocol as provided  for
              in article 15(3) of the Protocol. The Republic of South Africa

     Persons,  especially  Women  and  Children,  supplementing  the  United
     Nations Convention against  Transnational  Organised  Crime,  dated  19
     November 2003:


         The Select Committee on Security and Constitutional  Affairs,  when
         considering the request for approval by Parliament of the  Protocol

         5 of the said Protocol.


         Therefore, the Committee recommends that the Council  approve  that

                  Justice in differences arising out of  the  interpretation
                  or  application  of  the  Convention.  The  Republic  will
                  adhere to the position  that,  for  the  submission  of  a
                  particular dispute for  settlement  by  the  International
                  Court, the consent of all the parties to  the  dispute  is
                  required in every individual case."
