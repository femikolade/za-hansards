The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF  THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  on
behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the draft  resolution
printed in his name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to the resolution adopted by the House  on  24  June

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE -
              APPOINTMENT OF INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF INTELLIGENCE

Dr S C  CWELE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on
Intelligence is proud to recommend to  Parliament  the  name  of  Mr  Zolile
Thando Ngcakani for the position of Inspector-General of Intelligence.  This
position of Inspector-General of Intelligence was established  in  terms  of
section 210 of the  Constitution.  The  inspector-general  is  appointed  in
terms of section 7 of the Intelligence Services Oversight  Act,  Act  40  of
1994.
The functions  of  the  inspector-general,  among  others,  are  to  monitor
compliance of the services with  the  Constitution,  laws  and  policies  on
intelligence and counter-intelligence; to review intelligence  and  counter-
intelligence activities of the services;  and  to  receive  and  investigate
complaints from members of  the  public  and  members  of  the  services  on
alleged maladministration, abuse of power and  transgressions  of  laws  and
policies.

The previous inspector-general resigned on 18 February 2002 for private  and
personal reasons. The process of the appointment  of  the  inspector-general
involves the following. The Joint Standing Committee on  Intelligence  calls
for public nominations which are followed by  public  interviews  of  short-
listed candidates. The JSCI then recommends a name to the National  Assembly
for approval. The National Assembly must  approve  that  name  with  a  two-
thirds majority of its members. The approved name is then  referred  to  the
President who is responsible for the final appointment.

The  JSCI  received  46  applications,  considered  them  and  held   public
interviews with six candidates. The JSCI  is  proud  to  recommend  that  Mr
Zolile Thando Ngcakani be  considered  for  appointment  as  the  inspector-
general. I understand that Mr Ngcakane is sitting somewhere  in  the  public
gallery with some members. Could he stand up for the benefit  of  those  who
do not know him. [Applause.]

Mr Zolile Ngcakani is  a  world-renowned  water  civil  engineer  with  vast
experience in intelligence. While in exile,  he  furthered  his  studies  in
Russia, Kenya and Canada. He worked as an engineer in Kenya and lectured  at
the civil engineering department of the University  of  Nairobi.  He  worked
for many years in Canada as a senior review engineer who  also  advised  the
Canadian  government  on  waste  water  management  and   industrial   water
treatment projects.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Could hon members please settle down.

Dr S C CWELE: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. In 1994, he served in the  SA
Water Research Commission while subsequently seconded  to  the  Presidential
Review Commission for the Transformation and Reform of the  Public  Service.
In this capacity, he was exposed to the new  ethos  of  driving  the  Public
Service.

In 1996, he was appointed head of ministerial services in the  Ministry  for
Intelligence. In this position, he provided  management  and  administrative
services in support of the Minister. During  this  period,  he  also  headed
several committees and task teams. From November 2001 to date,  Mr  Ngcakane
has  been  acting  as  the  chief  executive  director   of   the   national
communications centre.

I  move  the  acceptance  of  the  report  before  this  House.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

There was no debate.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, in terms of section 7(1)(b)  of  Act
40 of 1994, the appointment of the inspector-general  must  be  approved  by
the National Assembly through a resolution supported by at least two  thirds
of its members, as the hon Chairperson of the JSCI has already said.

Although a division has not been demanded, it must be established  that  two
thirds of the members support the recommendation made in  the  report.  And,
therefore, the bells will have to be rung for five minutes to alert  members
that the question will now be put for decision.

During division:

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: As hon members know, cellphones are not allowed.

Question put: That Mr Zolile Thando Ngcakani be recommended for  appointment
as Inspector-General of Intelligence.

The support of two thirds of the members of  the  House  being  required  in
terms of section 7(1)(b)  of Act 40 of 1994, members recorded their  support
as follows:

The required support having been obtained, question agreed to.

Mr  Zolile  Thando  Ngcakani  accordingly  recommended  for  appointment  as
Inspector-General of Intelligence.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The President will be informed  that  Mr  Zolile  Thando
Ngcakani  is   recommended   for   appointment   as   Inspector-General   of
Intelligence. [Applause.]

Although  we  await  the  President's  endorsement  of  our  recommendation,
perhaps we should take this  opportunity  to  congratulate  Mr  Ngcakani,  a
member of our society who  obviously  has  conducted  himself  as  a  worthy
person. [Applause.]

                       PUBLIC PROTECTOR AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order, hon members! Those who  are  leaving  the  House,
please do so quietly. There is no list of speakers on this matter,  however,
the DA has requested an opportunity to make a declaration  of  vote.  I  now
grant them that opportunity.

Declarations of vote:

Adv H C  SCHMIDT:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  DA  will  not  support  the
amendments as proposed. The ANC has one, and only one, objective with  these
amendments, and that is to lower the standards for  the  appointment  of  an
individual to the office of the Public Protector.

This is in order to enable it  to  appoint  serving  ANC  MPs.  I  say  this
because after having served on the ad hoc committee for the  appointment  of
the  Public  Protector,  earlier   this   year,   and   having   interviewed
approximately 20 candidates, the ANC  appointed,  yes,  a  serving  ANC  MP,
after having to call for new nominations for the position  when  it  decided
that the first or original list of candidates  were  not  suitable  for  the
position, and reopened the nominations.

The  amendments  proposed  by  the  NCOP  widen  the  requirements  for  the
appointment of a Public Protector by  determining  that  individuals  should
have  ``acquired  any  combination  of  experience''  as  an  MP,  advocate,
attorney or lecturer in law of at least ten years. The DA strongly  supports
the principle that legal knowledge is an important  prerequisite  for  being
appointed as a Public Protector.

The current amendment enables MPs, in all probability ANC MPs, who have  no,
and I repeat no, legal knowledge whatsoever to  be  appointed  whether  they
have one, five or ten years experience as an MP with no qualification as  to
his or her experience gained in Parliament, for  example  in  the  Portfolio
Committees on Justice and  Constitutional  Development  and  on  Safety  and
Security, or related safety and security committees.

The DA will not endorse the ANC's attempt to  fill  important  positions  in
Chapter 9 institutions, requiring absolute independence, with  ANC  MPs,  in
accordance  with  the  ANC  cadre  redeployment  policy,  creating  an   ANC
hegemonous society controlled by  the  ANC.  The  DA  will  not  and  cannot
therefore support the proposed amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G SOLOMON: Deputy Speaker, the ANC believes that  the  Public  Protector,
as well as Chapter  9  institutions,  as  stated  in  the  Constitution,  is
subject only to the Constitution  and  the  law,  and  accountable  to  this
National Assembly.

I do not see the reason for the objection of  the  DA,  because  any  person
nominated, despite the amendment made by the NCOP, will  still  have  to  go
through a process of nomination. If the person is nominated the person  will
still have to submit a CV. There is an ad hoc committee of  this  Parliament
that will then go through that, and that person will then be recommended  by
this Parliament, and that name will then go to the President.

I can't see why the DA don't regard the members  sitting  here  as  fit  and
proper persons for any high position in the structures of Government. Or  do
they believe that the members of the IFP,  here,  are  not  fit  and  proper
persons? Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Do any other parties wish to  make  declarations?  None.
Are there any objections to the Bill being approved? Objection from the  DA,
hon Lee. [Interjections.] No, I am asking whether there's any  objection  to
the Bill being approved, and I want to recognise hon Lee.

Mr T D LEE: The DA wants its objection to be noted, please Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The objection of the DA  will  be  recorded.  Any  other
objections? No other objections, and therefore the Bill will be sent to  the
President for assent.

Bill approved (Democratic Alliance dissenting).

         JUDICIAL OFFICERS (AMENDMENT OF CONDITIONS OF SERVICE) BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

There was no debate.

Bill approved.

     CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON HOME AFFAIRS AND
     PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT - EASTERN CAPE STUDY TOUR

Mr E SALOOJEE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members,  my  apologies  for  being
late. The purpose of  our  visit  to  the  Eastern  Cape  was  parliamentary
oversight. Most specifically, to oversee the process  of  applying  for  and
issuing identity documents, and the registration  of  births.  The  critical
role that IDs and birth  certificates  play  in  the  speedy  and  efficient
processing  of  social  security  grant  appplications  was  of   particular
importance to the members of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development.

Officials  from  both  the  Departments  of  Home  Affairs  and  of   Social
Development assured members that, as far as they were concerned,  everything
was in place for this visit. Furthermore, members were led to  believe  that
all stakeholders in the areas to be visited had  been  consulted,  and  were
ready and expecting the parliamentary delegation.

However, it is not an exaggeration to say that members were appalled by  the
conditions found at most of the offices of  both  Home  Affairs  and  Social
Development in the Eastern Cape. The areas that we  visited  are  struggling
with the legacy of the old administration,  having  been  incorporated  into
the government of the Eastern Cape. Apart from the fact that corruption  and
maladministration  were  rife  in  the  former  Ciskei  and  Transkei,   the
realignment and amalgamation  of  government  departments  created  its  own
problems.

In many  cases,  the  Department  of  Social  Development  inherited  poorly
equipped offices and personnel who had a lack  of  capacity.  These  factors
make it very difficult for Government to deliver  an  efficient  service  in
the Eastern Cape.  We  encountered  the  physical  manifestations  of  these
serious problems on our oversight visit, and  I  wish  to  highlight  a  few
critical areas.

Firstly, the large number of people who applied for services and  grants  on
offer indicates that there is a big  need  for  these  services  and  social
grants. Social assistance has been recognised as one of the  most  important
poverty  alleviation  mechanisms  in  our  country.  It  is  important  that
administrative problems and issues do not  prevent  people  from  exercising
their  constitutionally  guaranteed  rights  to  access  social   assistance
grants. It is especially important that vulnerable and poor  people  in  the
Eastern Cape, and everywhere in our country,  are  treated  in  a  way  that
allows them to benefit from the rights and freedoms that we have  fought  so
hard to secure for them.

It was unfortunate to witness the lack of respect with which staff  of  both
departments treated some of the clients. An example, which is  one  of  many
to be found in our report of the point mentioned above,  was  our  visit  to
the Umtata Home Affairs office on 5 May. There was no sense  of  urgency  on
the part of officials serving the public.  Not  even  the  presence  of  the
parliamentary delegation could  spark  a  sense  of  urgency.  It  was  also
reported that  officials  were  accepting  bribes  in  order  to  prioritise
certain people.

Secondly, staff in the Home Affairs offices appeared to be multiskilled  and
seemed unwilling to assist their colleagues when  there  was  a  backlog  of
work. The latter situation seemed to occur even when the  staff  members  in
question had very few tasks to perform. This rigid and  narrow  thinking  of
officials impacts negatively on the delivery of IDs, birth certificates  and
access to social grants.

Our visit to the Mqanduli Home Affairs office illustrates this perfectly  in
that birth certificates were available to be distributed, but there  was  no
official to do the distribution. Our  delegation  was  told  that  only  one
person was responsible for issuing the birth  certificates,  and  when  that
person  was  absent,  nobody  could  issue  them.  This  is   obviously   an
unacceptable situation. I appeal to the Minister of  Home  Affairs  and  our
Government to continue to attend to this situation.

Other instances that struck us  were  that  both  Home  Affairs  and  Social
Development offices were regularly ill-equipped, and that conducive  working
conditions rarely prevailed. The physical state of  offices  was  appalling.
Many offices were situated in structures that were utterly  unfit  to  serve
as offices, and where offices were structurally sound, they were  dirty  and
in need of paint and generally dilapidated.

However, it would be unfair to only emphasise the negative  aspects  of  our
visit. For example, the Social Development office at Mqanduli was very  well
organised on the day, as were the Home  Affairs  officials  on  the  day  we
visited the Ntabankulu Town Hall.

Allow me to refer briefly to the recommendations contained  in  our  report.
The most important recommendation is that officials  from  both  departments
must adhere to the Batho Pele principles - we must put our people first.

Furthermore, the disturbing divide between  what  both  the  Departments  of
Social Development and of Home Affairs say, and  the  reality  at  grassroot
level should be eradicated. If nothing is done in this regard, we  could  be
faced with a possibility that would-be  voters  and  beneficiaries  will  be
denied their constitutional rights to access social  security  benefits  and
to vote.

In this regard, it is  encouraging  to  note  the  decisive  action  by  the
Minister of Social Development and his officials in terminating the  service
delivery contract with Cash Paymaster Services. This is  indicative  of  the
commitment by our Government to eradicating the corruption and poor  service
that led to the tragic death of one recipient.

It has unfortunately come to our attention that a member of  the  opposition
has been quoted in the Daily Despatch as saying that as many as five  people
had  died  as  a  result  of  such  poor  service  delivery.  It  is  highly
questionable that the  opposition  exploits  such  tragedies  for  political
gain. When scrutinising the  press  of  that  period,  we  can't  find  such
information.

All of the above must be seen in the context of the overhaul of  our  social
assistance system and  the  establishment  of  a  national  social  security
agency. Our portfolio committee is currently  engaged  with  legislation  to
establish such an agency, and in this  process,  members  of  the  committee
draw on information obtained from oversight visits in order to  enrich  this
legislation. This ensures that the  provisions  in  the  draft  statute  are
informed by practical experience.

We see the establishment of the Social Security Agency as one  of  the  most
important steps in addressing the problems of service  delivery  in  respect
of social grants in the Eastern Cape, and the rest of our country. The  main
objective of the agency will  be  to  ensure  the  efficient  and  effective
management of administration and payment of  social  assistance.  This  will
ensure that there is equal access to social security for all  citizens.  The
agency will be responsible for  implementing  uniform  norms  and  standards
with regard to service delivery in the country.

The establishment of this national agency will  present  serious  challenges
for the Government. One of these relates  to  the  transfer  of  staff  from
provinces to the agency. In this process we must ensure that  personnel  are
not simply transferring with them the patterns  of  inefficiency  that  have
emerged in many cases.

Secondly, we must ensure that the transfer to the  agency  does  not  impact
... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, we  are  now  nine  years
into our new  democracy.  We  often  use  the  slogan,  referred  to  by  my
chairperson, of Batho Pele - putting the people first. If this report is  an
accurate reflection of the  situation  on  the  ground,  then,  really,  the
reality is somewhat different. There are dirty offices,  there  are  chronic
delays in serving people, there are shortages of staff,  beneficiaries  have
to stand outside in all types  of  weather,  there  are  queues,  there  are
unhygienic conditions and, in  places,  there  is  bribery  and  corruption.
These are some of the things that the joint delegation found in the  Eastern
Cape.

However, not only did the joint delegation find this  distressing  state  of
affairs, but the Public Service Commission  confirmed  these  findings.  The
chairperson of the commission says, and we need  to  listen  carefully:  ``A
critical dimension of any performance measurement system  is  an  assessment
of the satisfaction levels amongst the  citizens  to  whom  the  service  is
being delivered.'' Their report assessed both strengths and weaknesses.

In referring to the Department of Social Development,  the  report  revealed
that the following needed attention: the attitude  and  behaviour  of  staff
towards  beneficiaries;  the  lack  of   easy   access   for   people   with
disabilities; the shortage of toilets, shelter, seating  and  first  aid  at
most facilities; and dissatisfaction with the help desk.

However, I don't  want  to  be  biased  here  as  citizens  expressed  their
satisfaction with the following: they were able to understand  the  language
that  the  staff  in  the  department  used;  staff   kept   their   details
confidential; payment points were easily accessible  via  public  transport;
the department's offices were conveniently located  for  them  to  register;
and they were able to contact the department telephonically.

Now, in the foreword to the current strategic plan, the Minister  of  Social
Development refers to new gains made since 2000. He says, and I quote:


  Important amongst these initiatives is the  massive  mobilisation  around
  the registration of social grants as announced by the  President  in  his
  state of the nation address. This mobilisation  must  be  accompanied  by
  significant improvements in the administration of social grants  by  both
  the national and provincial departments of social development.

If we are going to address the problems in administering these  grants,  the
Departments of Social Development and of  Home  Affairs  will  have  to  co-
operate with each other much more closely. It has become very apparent  that
Home Affairs simply does not have enough money to do this work. And  it  was
very reassuring to hear the President say today that  the  department  would
not be short of resources, but it cannot issue IDs  and  birth  certificates
to enable people to register to receive the grants.

The end result of the lack of resources and the bungling is  that  thousands
of elderly and disabled people and children are just not getting  the  money
the Department of Finance is making available to them. Now, this is  tragic.
It is the very point  at  which  our  well-intentioned  plans  to  alleviate
poverty come unstuck. We have fancy plans on glossy paper, but they are  not
getting from there to the poor people, for example of the Western Cape.

Despite having almost trebled the number of  beneficiaries  in  the  country
since 1998 - and that is good - only 42% of eligible children are  receiving
the child support grants. Now,  that  is  bad.  It  is  tragic,  and  it  is
scandalous.

The portfolio committee  invited  the  MEC  of  social  development  in  the
Eastern Cape, Ms Moerane-Mamase, and the company responsible for paying  out
grants to meet with the committee to find out where the problems  were,  and
how we could assist in improving delivery. The MEC did not  even  bother  to
arrive. Now that's how seriously she viewed the problems. People were  dying
in the queues in her province, but that was of no consequence  to  her.  And
the official that she sent in her place  merely  passed  the  buck  to  Cash
Paymaster Services, the company involved.

The good news in all this mess was that a monitoring committee had been  set
up. The bad news was that it didn't monitor and that the MEC didn't  appear.
The monitoring committee didn't monitor, and the people were left  in  their
poverty.

This committee must be commended for both  their  oversight  visit  and  the
honesty with which they put the report together. But if the people are  ever
to be put first, the recommendations in  this  report  must  be  transformed
into action. The DA is committed to doing all in  its  power  to  assist  in
achieving this. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M M MAUNYE: Chairperson, in March 2002 the Minister of Home  Affairs  had
this to say during the strategic planning  workshop  of  the  Department  of
Home Affairs, and I quote:


  Tangible goals and clear performance  indicators  will  provide  us  with
  better tools to identify where we need  to  give  more  resources  ...  I
  believe that training remains our greatest  responsibility  and  we  must
  build training within everything we do in the department ... We must also
  develop a culture of training within the department to ensure that people
  share knowledge and that everyone takes it upon  himself  or  herself  to
  train somebody else, or be trained by someone else.
These prophetic words were both a  recognition  of  the  problems  that  our
Department of Home Affairs is facing and, secondly,  of  what  needs  to  be
done to overcome the problems.

The problems that the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  was  referring  to  were
clearly demonstrated to us during our joint study tour to the Eastern  Cape.
We could not believe that there are still members of our civil  service  who
still treat our people with utter disregard. This is unacceptable  behaviour
from the staff of the department. The issue of office equipment  was  raised
in that most computers were old,  printers  were  outdated,  there  were  no
photocopying machines, there was a shortage of staff, there were  inadequate
mobile units, and there wasn't enough stationery. This impedes the  delivery
of services.

If the Department of Home Affairs cannot be in a position to  deliver  basic
services, such as IDs and birth certificates, we  can  simply  forget  about
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. The centrality of the  department  in
this endeavour  cannot  be  overemphasised.  The  Deputy  Minister  of  Home
Affairs recognised the centrality of the department when  she  said,  and  I
quote:


  During the January 2002 Cabinet lekgotla, it was once again evident  that
  there is a growing need for  all  sections  of  our  Government  to  plan
  together in communication with each other in order to  ensure  integrated
  development and a common approach to delivery of services. The department
  is allocated  a  very  central  role  in  the  broad  planning  cycle  of
  Government.

I want to focus on the problems that we observed in the Eastern  Cape.  What
we are about to hear is what our people endure every day in  that  province.
There were long queues in some  areas.  People  were  standing  outside  the
office, in cool or hot weather. There was no proper management  of  offices,
and no commitment on the  part  of  staff.  The  attitude  of  some  of  the
officials was disturbing, showing no sense of  urgency  regarding  the  fact
that people had travelled long distances. The principle of  Batho  Pele  was
not being adhered to.
Batho ba ile ba tla,  ba  utlwa  pitso.  Ba  ne  ba  tlile  ka  bongata  moo

[People came, they heard the invitation.  They  came  in  large  numbers  to
those meetings. Most of the people's complaints were about  incorrect  ages,
which appeared in their identity documents. Wherever we went,  the  problems
were about the wrong ages, which in most cases  were  lower  than  the  real
ages, which prevented people from receiving their old age grants.

This is why there is so much poverty in the Eastern Cape. The other  problem
is about the grandmothers who raise their grandchildren. There are  official
documents that are supposed to be filled in in order to apply for the  birth
certificates, so that these children can get the social grants, to  help  in
their upbringing.

Another point is the youth who were born in rural areas where there  are  no
clinics or hospitals. These children have the right to be assisted in  order
to get their birth certificates or identity  documents.  The  Department  of
Social Development also has some weaknesses. It is really surprising  how  a
seven-month-old child, who is an orphan, can go without food, milk,  clothes
or even a vest or nappy, when we have social workers in our communities.
In his speech, the honourable President said that all  government  employees
who are not prepared to  work  and  fulfil  their  responsibilities,  should
resign. This Government is for the people, elected by the people. We  should
work hard to address our people's needs. We  should  make  it  possible  for
every South African citizen to have an  ID.  Every  child  and  every  youth
should also have all the necessary documents that give them their rights  as
South African citizens.

We are asking the Department of Social Services to work together with  other
departments, especially the Department of  Home  Affairs,  to  have  offices
where they are needed. Those offices  should  be  renovated  in  order  that
people can see that they are Home Affairs offices.]

We now have a director-general in the Department  of  Home  Affairs.  It  is
important to co-operate with the department  in  order  to  ensure  that  we
deliver to our people. There are funds that  have  been  allocated  for  the
opening of additional offices and information technology,  and  Cabinet  has
approved the filling of 349 vacancies.

We also call for there to be proper security of  offices,  especially  where
IDs and birth certificates are kept. Jointly, as members of  Parliament,  we
should assist the department with the distribution  of  uncollected  IDs  by
displaying lists in  our  constituencies.  We  also  need  to  call  on  our
communities and people in that  as  South  African  citizens  they  need  to
ensure that they have IDs and/or birth certificates.

Modula setulo ke a leboha. [Thank you, Chairperson.] [Applause.]

Mr E T FERREIRA: Chairperson, the IFP notes the report of the visit  to  the
Eastern Cape by the Home Affairs and Social Development committees.  In  the
report there is very little we can seriously find fault with. Initially  the
report was going to be rather one-sided, with Home  Affairs  being  made  to
look  as  bad  as  possible  and  Social  Development   almost   hunky-dory.
Fortunately, sanity prevailed and we now have  a  more  fair  reflection  of
what we saw during that week.

The five-day visit to the Eastern Cape during May this year was, of  course,
an eye-opener in more ways than  one.  The  poverty  we  saw  in  the  whole
Transkei area was absolutely shocking. Apart from the  fact  that  very  few
people are employed there, it was  very  clear  that  the  majority  of  the
people in those rural areas seldom see a decent plate of food. I  personally
did not expect that nine years into our new democracy one would see  poverty
to that extent anywhere in South Africa.

Two days ago an hon member of this House stood at this  podium  and  bragged
about how anyone he speaks to tells him how their lives have improved  since
1994. As I listened to him, I seriously wondered whether  we  actually  live
in the same country. One would really like to challenge this  member  to  go
to the rural areas of the Eastern Cape  and  sell  his  ``pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty'' story to those unfortunate  people  and  see  whether
they will take him seriously.
I know that some politicians have a tendency to  stretch  the  truth  rather
far, but in this case I would suggest that it was plain dishonesty. One  has
to be reasonable and accept that Rome was not built in a day.  At  the  rate
we are going, however, one is afraid that it's going to take 1 000 years  to
build Rome, which is simply not good enough.  After  centuries  of  neglect,
our people really deserve so much better than this.

Coming back to the report before us today, it is a reasonable reflection  of
what we saw during that visit. We saw some promising things as far  as  both
Home Affairs and Social Development are concerned.  But  we  also  saw  many
things which need serious improvement.

The physical buildings and structures that both  departments  are  using  in
that area are simply not up to standard. In many cases houses  are  used  as
offices, which is simply not sufficient for the large number of people  that
they are supposed to serve.

The condition of the buildings is  also  generally  not  conducive  to  good
staff moral. I cannot  imagine  how  any  staff  member  in  some  of  those
buildings can feel any other way than depressed when they come  to  work  in
the morning. The laissez-faire attitude of some  staff  members,  especially
senior staff members, as we have already heard, does not help the  situation
either.

We also got complaints that  some  staff  members  accept  bribes  to  serve
members of the public before others. There  was  also  the  allegation  that
there were corrupt practices in general. This  is  an  allegation  that  one
finds in just about every single Government department and it  is  sometimes
difficult to determine how many of such allegations are in fact true.

Whereas I have no doubt in my mind that  many  allegations  of  bribery  and
corruption are true in our Government departments and  society  in  general,
one must keep in mind that  we  live  in  a  country  where  everyone  makes
allegations  against  everyone  else.  We  must  guard   against   accepting
allegations as fact, as we  tend  to  do  in  South  Africa.  Unfortunately,
perceptions seem to be much more important than reality. In  general,  there
is a lot of hard work to be done in both departments in order to  serve  the
public better.

It is not all doom and gloom, however. There are many  things  that  are  in
fact working well. Many hundreds, if not thousands, of  people  were  helped
during that week by both departments. If  the  said  departments  are  given
more funds, which we all know they so desperately need, there  is  no  doubt
that they can and will do a much better job. Thank you.

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI: Chairperson, I  just  want  this  House  to  know  that
although the hon member Borman was talking so passionately  about  the  trip
here, she was not even part of that trip. The DA was not there. Perhaps  the
deep rural areas of the Eastern Cape is not a place the DA likes  to  visit.
Yet she spoke so passionately about it as if she was there.

Maybe, in order to know what was happening, you need to  go  to  those  deep
rural areas and actually see that poverty for yourself so as  to  know  what
is happening. So next time, hon member Borman, you must go  to  the  Eastern
Cape and not just read reports, then come here and mislead the people.

Mhlalingaphambili,  malungu  ahloniphekileyo,  omnye  wemisebenzi  ephambili
yamalungu epalamente yi``oversight'', ukujonga  ukuba  ngaba  imigaqo-nkqubo
kaRhulumente iyafezekiswa kusini na. Ezi komiti  zimbini  zityelele  iphondo
leMpuma  Koloni  ukuya  kuhlola  ukuba  konke  kwenzeka  ngendlela  na.   Xa
silijonga eli phondo iMpuma Koloni, silibona  lilelinye  eliphambili  kulawo
athwaxwa yindlala, apho uninzi lwabantu lungenamisebenzi, apho  kukho  khona
abantu abasele bekhulile kunye nabantwana abasakhulayo.

Ngokwengxelo yonyaka ka-2001 yequmrhu i-Statistics SA,  abantu  abangamawaka
angamakhulu  asixhenxe  anamashumi   amane   anesibini,   anamakhulu   amane
namashumi amabini anesixhenxe (742 427)  bakwiminyaka  yokuba  bangasebenza,
kodwa  ngenxa  yentswelo-misebenzi,   abasebenzi.   Le   meko   ayidalekanga
kwiminyaka   elithoba   eyadlulayo.   Yinto   ekukudala   ikhona,    esizama
ukusebenzana  nayo.  Sisebenzana  nento   ekukudala   ikhona.   Kangangokuba
siyabona  ngoku  i-Statistics  SA  iyakwazi  ukukhupha  iinkcukacha  malunga
nabantu abangasebenziyo. Ngexesha lakudala eziya  ndawo  ezifana  neTranskei
zazingabalwa  njengenxenye  yoMzantsi  Afrika.  Sasingayazi   imeko   mayela
nentlupheko,  indlala  kunye  nentswelo-misebenzi  injani  na.  Kambe  ngoku
siyazi ... (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, hon members, one of the functions of members of Parliament  is
oversight, which is overseeing that Government policies are  implemented  in
a proper manner. The two committees visited the Eastern Cape to see  whether
things were working well. When we look at the Eastern Cape, we can see  that
it is one of the areas that is very poor, where the majority of  people  are
unemployed, and where there are many old people and young people.

According to a report released by Statistics SA, 742 427 people  of  working
age, are unemployed because of lack of jobs. This situation did not  develop
in the last nine years. It is a problem that has always been there and  with
which we are trying to deal by all means. It is good that Statistics SA  has
given a detailed report of people who are unemployed. Previously areas  like
the former Transkei were not part of South Africa. We did not know  how  big
the issue of poverty, hunger and levels of unemployment were.  Now  we  know
... ]

... and that is the reason we have to address that problem.

Yonke ke le nto yenza into yokuba  abantu  abaninzi  baxhomekeke  kwinkxaso-
mali uRhulumente athi abonelele ngayo abantu  abadala,  abo  bakhubazekileyo
kunye nabantwana.  Kubalulekile  okokuba  iSebe  leMicimbi  yezeKhaya  kunye
nelezoPhuhliso loLuntu asebenze ngokubambisana, ukwenzela  ukuba  abo  bantu
baselungelweni  lokuxhamla   kwizibonelelo   zikaRhulumente   bakwenze   oko
ngaphandle kwamagingxigingxi.

Enye yeengxaki ezifumanekayo kwisithili sase O R Tambo yinto  yokuba  ucando
(demarcation)  lwesithili  seengingqi  zeSebe  lemiCimbi   yezeKhaya   kunye
nelezoPhuhliso  loLuntu  alufani.  Ezinye  iindawo  wofumana  ukuba   ziwela
phantsi kwephondo iKwaZulu-Natal logama, ngaxesha nye,  ziphantsi  kwephondo
leMpuma Koloni. Zonke ezo zinto zenza into yokuba intsebenziswano  ingahambi
ngendlela.

Mna andizi kuthetha  kakhulu  ngeengxaki  nanjengoko  amanye  amalungu  sele
ezikhankanyile.  Xa  la  masebe   enikwe   izibonelelo,   Mhlalingaphambili,
kufuneka sibonelele izinto  ezinjenge``one-stop  shop'',  apho  kukho  zonke
izinto. Ngolo hlobo bangathi abantu xa beye  kufuna  uncedo  oluthi  lunikwe
nguRhulumente  bakwazi  ukuzifumana  ezo  zinto  kwindawo  enye,  kuba  into
eyenzekayo kukuba abantu bahamba imigama  emide,  bachitha  iimali  ezininzi
abangenazo, njengoko behluphekile. Kanti, xa ikhona iofisi yeSebe  lezeKhaya
kunye  neyezoPhuhliso  loLuntu  ndaweni  nye,  abantu  baya  kukwazi  ukuthi
bafikelele kuloo ndawo bazenze zonke  ezo  zinto  ngaxesha  nye  bengakhange
babheka ngapha nangaphaya.

Ke sothulela umnqwazi ooceba ngegalelo labo lokuncedisana  neSebe  lezeKhaya
ekuhambiseni izazisi,  kwaye  sikhuthaza  into  yokuba  konke  oku  kwenzeke
ngentsebenziswano kunye neSebe lezeKhaya, kuba kaloku  abantu  abaphethe  lo
mcimbi ngabo beSebe lezeKhaya. Bona bayabazi  abantu  bekwaziqonda  neemfuno
zabantu.  Siyazi  nento  yokuba  kukho   nezazisi   ezilele   kwezo   ndawo,
ezingaphuthunywayo ngabantu, ekuye  kuthi  ke  ooceba  babazi  abanye  kwabo
bantu bazo kwaye babakhuthaze ukuba baye kuzilanda.

Zonke ezi zinto zenza into  yokuba  abantu  bakwazi  ukuba  bafikelele  kolo
ncedo uRhulumente alunikayo, kuba xa singakwazi ukunceda  abantu  ngomthetho
esiwuwisileyo thina, asikwazi ke ngoko  ukuyisusa  ikati  eziko.  Nanjengoko
sisazi ukuba uMongameli wethu  uthi  masilibhekelisele  phaya,  lisuke,  elo
liwa lendlala ebantwini abalambayo, ukwenzela ukuba abantu  bakwazi  ukwenza
izinto zabo.

Sihlaba ikhwelo kubo  bonke  abahlali  abangekazilandi  izazisi  zabo  ukuba
bancede baye kuzilanda, nabo bangekabi nazo  benze  izicelo  zezazisi,  kuba
uRhulumente wenze umtyhi wokuba  abantu  abangenamali  bahambe  baye  kufaka
izicelo. Isazisi mna ndisibona njengeqhayiya  kum,  nanjengommi  waseMzantsi
Afrika. Okokuqala, sindenza ndibonakale  ukuba  ndingummi  walapha  eMzantsi
Afrika. Okwesibini, sinceda ekubeni lowo  unelungelo  lokuxhamla  abe  nakho
ukuxhamla kuba kaloku isazisi unaso njengoko bebaninzi  abangeneleli  abathi
baxhamle. Makuqale  kuxhamle  abemi  baseMzantsi  Afrika  kuqala.  Kambe  xa
isithi bahlali - ndibhekisa kubahlali ngoku - abangazithabathiyo ezi  zazisi
zethu, singazenzi nezicelo, kuza kuxhamla abanye  abantu  ngelungelo  lethu.
Ndiyacela ke kubahlali bethu ukuba balisebenzise eli thuba.

Sinengqiniseko yokuba zonke ezi  ngxaki  zikhoyo  zezimayelana  nezibonelelo
ikakhulu.  Kungoku  nje  siququzelela  uMthetho  oYilwayo   obizwa   ngokuba
yi``National Security Agency Bill'' esibonisana ngawo, noya  kuthi  ulungise
zonke ezi ngxaki zikhoyo ezibangela ukuba abantu abadala, abantwana  nabantu
abakhubazekileyo bangazifumani ngendlela  izibonelelo  ezo.  Sizama  ukususa
ubuqhophololo kwanezinye izenzo ezingalunganga.  Silungiselela  ukuba  zonke
izinto   abantu   abathi   bazifumane   bazifumane   ngendlela,   bangaxinwa
bubuqhophololo nezinye izenzo ezibi. Konke oku sikwenza sisenzela  ukugxotha
indlala, senzela ukunceda abantu baseMzantsi Afrika.

Kambe sizezi komiti  zimbini  sibulela  ithuba  lokuba  sikwazi  okwenzekayo
eMpuma  Koloni.  Siye  ngokwethu,  thina  bantu  bakhathelele  abantu,  hayi
imibutho enjenge-DA, efunda  emaphepheni  ze  ihambe  iye  kukwenza  ingxelo
ngaphandle. [Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[All these issues create a situation where many people  have  to  depend  on
money that the Government grants to old people, the disabled  and  children.
It is important that the Department of Home Affairs and  the  Department  of
Social Services work together so that those people  that  have  a  right  to
benefit from these services can do so without any hassles.

One of the  many  problems  that  exists  in  the  O  R  Tambo  district  is
demarcation of areas that fall under the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  and
those that fall under the Department of  Social  Services.  One  would  find
that some areas fall under KwaZulu-Natal while at the same time, they  would
be taken to be belonging to the Eastern Cape Province.  All  this  makes  it
difficult for matters to take place the way they should.

I think I should not say much about these  problems  as  other  hon  members
have cited them already. When these departments have  been  allocated  their
share of funds and services, Chairperson, I think we should  have  what  are
called ``one-stop shops'',  where  everything  would  be  available  at  one
place. That way, service would be available in one place because  what  also
happens is that people have to walk or travel very long distances,  spending
a lot of money they do not have, as  they  are  poor.  But,  if  there  were
offices of both the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of  Social
Services in one place or close to one another, people would be  able  to  do
all that is necessary at the same time without having  to  travel  back  and
forth.

We commend the councillors for their assistance to the  Department  of  Home
Affairs by delivering identity documents and  we  would  like  to  encourage
that all these efforts take place in co-operation  with  the  Department  of
Home Affairs. The councillors are in constant contact with the  people,  and
therefore, they know and understand their needs. We  also  know  that  there
are  identity  documents  that  are  not  collected  by  their  owners   and
councillors would know some of the  people  and  talk  them  into  going  to
collect them.

These are all efforts to make Government's  services  accessible  to  people
because if we cannot assist people so that they can benefit  from  the  laws
that we have drawn ourselves, then we cannot reduce or  remove  poverty.  As
we all know, our President calls on all of us to drive  back  the  frontiers
of poverty so that people can do things themselves.

We are blowing the whistle and we are saying to all those that have not  yet
collected their identity documents that they should hasten  to  do  so,  and
that those who have not  yet  applied  for  new  identity  documents  should
please go and do so because the Government has made it  possible  for  those
who do not have money to apply for new ones.  Having  an  identity  document
makes me proud as a citizen of South Africa. Firstly, it proves that I am  a
respectable member of society and a citizen of South  Africa.  Secondly,  it
enables those that have a right to benefit from Government's services to  do
so and it separates him or her from fraudsters. Let the  citizens  of  South
Africa benefit first. As citizens of the country, if we do not  collect  our
identity documents and if we do not apply  for  grants,  other  people  will
overtake us. I am asking our people to use this opportunity.

We want to believe that all these problems are  mainly  about  services  and
grants. We are now preparing the National Security Agency Bill  which  seeks
to take into consideration all  these  kinds  of  problems  that  cause  old
people, children and the disabled not to be able to access these grants.  We
are trying to root out corruption and other activities  that  are  unlawful.
Our aim is to make things available to those that  are  rightfully  supposed
to benefit from services and not be deterred by corrupt  people.  All  these
are efforts to fight poverty and to help people of South Africa.
We are glad to have had an opportunity to learn about what is  happening  in
the Eastern Cape. We went there ourselves, as people who care about  others,
and not like organisations like the DA, that read what is written  on  paper
and go and claim that they know what is going on. [Applause.]]

Mr S PILLAY: Thank you, Chairperson. There can be no doubt that the  offices
of the Department of Home Affairs in the Eastern Cape  are  in  a  shambles.
Only two officials were available to attend to more than 60  applicants  per
day. This situation was further complicated  by  the  unhygienic  conditions
that prevailed there. An illustration is that there was  a  total  disregard
for the safe storing of all enabling documents. This meant that  any  member
of the public could walk in and rummage through the birth  certificates  and
other documents. This situation is further  complicated  by  the  fact  that
there is  no  secure  area  in  which  to  store  documents.  This  horrible
situation has prevailed since 2001.

At the Mqanduli Social Development office it was found  that  there  was  no
shelter from hostile weather elements and the  committee  was  advised  that
plans had been approved to build a shelter. For the past five  years  people
have had to endure this state of affairs. When will  it  be  corrected?  The
Home Affairs office there is a health hazard. The structure, for want  of  a
better word, was made of zinc and does not  have  toilets  or  a  telephone.
There was no official to issue birth certificates, therefore, no  one  could
register for any social grant.

At the Mapuzi Technical College there were no  Home  Affairs  officials  and
there were long queues of people waiting to  be  attended  to.  Most  people
indicated that they could not afford the fee of about R36  for  photographs.
This created a major problem as they could not apply for identity  documents
without photographs and, as a consequence, could not apply  for  any  social
grant until they were in possession of those identity documents.

The Umzimvubu Local Municipality that falls under the  Alfred  Nzo  District
serves 32 wards. The community has to travel to  Mt  Frere,  Mt  Ayliff  and
Maluti for services. All of those  offices  are  far  from  each  other  and
inconveniently situated to serve residents from that area.

Chairperson, the situation that I described is prevalent throughout most  of
the Eastern Cape. The fact that the people in that province  are  unable  to
receive services from the Department of Home Affairs is an  issue  of  great
concern. The Minister must take responsibility for the chaos  that  prevails
there and take immediate steps to remedy  the  situation  so  that  ordinary
people can receive some form of relief.

Chairperson, the people in that province, especially black people  in  rural
areas, are in need of urgent and immediate assistance. It  is  the  duty  of
the Minister of Home Affairs to ensure that  every  South  African  receives
the enabling documents. The physical infrastructure, computer systems  where
they exist, transport and personnel, must be audited as a matter of  urgency
and where there are shortcomings, they must be addressed.

A needs analysis should include the  location  of  offices,  their  location
with consideration to where Social Development offices are, the  filling  of
vacant  posts,  training  of  staff,  a  method   of   securing   documents,
transporting documents from local offices to head office, and the  efficient
and fast delivery of identity documents and birth  certificates  after  they
are  received  by  the  local  office.  An  excellent  start  would  be   to
investigate the needs of every office in the province.

We have stated on more  than  one  occasion  that  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs interacts with every South African citizen from birth  through  till
death, and with every person that either leaves or enters  the  country.  If
these matters are not attended to, we will subject innocent people  to  more
pain, poverty, misery and hunger. Again, the unfortunate aspect is  that  it
is the same people that continue to suffer.

It  is  the  obligation  of  every  responsible  person  and  every   public
representative to visit the offices of the Department  of  Home  Affairs  to
see how they operate. We have only one choice in this matter,  and  that  is
to ensure that this department functions efficiently.  The  budget  for  the
whole  province  and  each  office  needs  to  be  interrogated  and,  where
necessary, adjustments need to be effected.

As an illustration, no allocation was made  for  computers  in  the  current
budget. From the chaos that exists an urgent  programme  of  action  between
all relevant departments would  yield  excellent  results,  and  it  is  the
Department of Home Affairs that should lead and clearly outline its needs.

Chairperson, the impact of Circular Q4 should be evaluated as it  creates  a
climate of despondency and confusion. Some senior officials are  using  that
circular to reject applications for promotions, and that must be managed.  A
more comprehensive supervision, reporting and  accountability  process  must
be implemented without delay. That means  officials  from  the  head  office
must visit the local offices as a routine process  and  certainly  not  wait
for parliamentary portfolio committees to initiate such visits.

Chairperson, we urge this House to take note of the  issues  and  to  assist
the portfolio  committees  to  exercise  their  oversight  role  in  a  more
vigorous and consistent manner. Thank you.

Prof L M MBADI: Sekela-Somlomo,  mandiqale  ngokumncoma  uMnu  Pillay,  kuba
nakuba wayengekho kolu khenketho, kambe uyifundile ingxelo  waza  wayitolika
ngale ndlela ayitolike ngayo. Siyabulela mntakwethu.

Iikomiti ezimbini, phantsi kwento kaChauke nento kaSaloojee, zavana  ngokuba
zenze ukhenketho  lweendawo  ezininzi  phaya  kulaa  maphandle  ekwakufudula
kusithiwa ngumntla-mpuma Transkei.  Iinjongo  ke  zolu  khenketho  ibikukuya
kuhlola unatyiso lweenkonzo eziqulunqwe  ukuhlangabezana  neemfuno  zabantu.
Ingxelo esixoxa ngayo  yileyo  ithiwe  thaca  phambi  kwamalungu  ePalamente
ukuze  ayihlalutye,   abone   ukuba   iingxaki   zabantu   zingahlangatyezwa
zisonjululwe njani na.

Masiqale ngokuthi oorhulumente bengcinezelo apha eMzantsi Afrika  naseAfrika
jikelele baziphatha njengemigqakhwe  eyayingafanelwanga  zizinto  zenkqubela
nempucuko  iindawo  zasemaphandleni  nabantu  bazo.  Ezo   zinto   zaphelela
ezixekweni ezikhulu ezinjengoomaRhawuti,  oomaKapa,  oomaBhayi,  ooThekwini,
njalonjalo, nto ke leyo eyenze ukuba abantu babe ziimbacu ezashiya  amakhaya
zaya kuxelenga kwezo ndawo zinoshishino nenkqubela.  Abantu  bezi  ndawo  ke
ngoku bakhala  isimbonono  bathi,  ``Thina  singabantwana  bakabani  na?  Le
nkululeko nempucuko yofika nini na apha kuthi?''

Mawethu,  kubi  emaphandleni!  Ikati  ilel'  eziko.  Abantu  nomhlaba   wabo
bambatshile,  baxwebile,   banxunguphele.   Umhlaba   uziindonga,   iindlela
ngamageduka,   ubhubhane   ugawula   omdala   nomncinci,   kusisijwili   nje
esikhwankqisayo.  Kungcwatywa  umntu  phezu  komntu.  Bakhale  zada   zomela
iinyembezi.

Olu  khenketho  lwethu  ke  lube  yimpendulo  kwiincwina  ezenziwa   ngabemi
basemaphandleni ezifana nezi: ``Abantwana bethu  abanazo  izazisi  zokuzalwa
khon' ukuze  baxhamle  amalungelo  abo  abawanikwa  nguRhulumente  okhokelwa
nguKhongolose.  Uninzi  lwabantu  phaya  luseneziya   zazisi   zengcinezelo,
oodompas, nto zingaxeliyo nokuba umntu wazalwa nini na. Abafundi  abalungele
ukuba bangavota kunyaka ozayo abanazazisi.

Enye ingxaki abanayo kukunqongophala kweenkozo zokuya  nokubuya  edolophini,
ekukuphela kwendawo ekufunyanwa kuyo  izazisi.  Bayithatha  phi  yona  imali
yokuhlawulela iifoto?  Idolophu  kuphela  kwendawo  ekwenziwa  kuyo  izicelo
zenkxaso-mali  yabantwana  abakhubazekileyo  nezabantu  abadala.   Aphi   ke
amarherhebe okuya apho?

Ukuzama  ukuhlangabezana  nala  makhwiniba  akhwinisa  uninzi  lwabantu  ke,
iikomiti zagqibe ekubeni  zikhenkethe  esona  sixeko  sikhulu  kumntla-mpuma
Koloni,  i-OR  Tambo.  Esi  sixeko  sakhiwwa  zezi  zixekwana  zinamaphandle
amakhulu,  uMasipala  i-KSD,  oquka  uMtata  noMqanduli;  iNyandeni,   equka
iLibode neNgqeleni; uMasipala wasePort St Johns; uMasipala uMhlontlo,  oquka
uQumbu noTsolo; uMasipala waseNtabankulu;  Masipala  waseQawukeni,  owakhiwe
nguLusikisiki neFlagstaff; uMasipala iMbizana, owakhiwe ngeBhizana.

Emva kodliwanondlebe namagosa aphezulu kwiinkonzo zoluntu  eMtata,  amalungu
eekomiti agqiba ekubeni ezi nkonzo mazisiwe ebantwini kunokuba  abantu  beze
kuzo. Yaqala apho ke  le  nkqubo  kaRhulumente  yokusa  iinkonzo  ebantwini,
watsho waqhawuk' unobathana, kwayiwa  le  nale.  Inkqubo  yezazisi  nezicelo
zenkxaso zasiwa ebantwini. Kwaqalwa  eMapuzi  Technical  College  eMqanduli,
kwa Wadi 1. Kwafikwa  ingengomntu  kunyakazela,  abantu  benxanelwe  uncedo,
kucace mhlophe ukuba abangako abantu babengena kugqitywa.

Igqiza lekomiti, emva kothetha-thethwano nabantu, laphawula iingxaki  zokuba
abantu  abaqinisekanga  ukuba  ngubani   omakafumane   inkamnkam,   ingubani
omakafumane  isibonelelo  senkxaso-mali  yabantwana.  Eyona  ngxaki   inkulu
kukungaqiniseki  ngeminyaka  yobudala.  Uninzi  lwabantu  alunawo  la  ma-20
eerandi eefoto, nto leyo eyenza ukuba uninzi lungabi nazazisi.

Kukubi kunjalo,  sakwazi  ukunceda  inanana  elikhulu  apha  naphaya,  kodwa
kwahle kwacaca  ukuba  sasingena  kuphuphumelela.  Sazihamba  zonke  iindawo
ekwakumele  ukuba  sibe  sazihamba,   safumanisa   ukuba   iimeko   ziyafana
nezeendawo esasele sifikile kuzo.

Ewe,  kambe  sizivile  izaphuselana   ziphukaneka   zisithi:   ``UKhongolose
ulungiselela uvoto ngezi ntshukumo.'' Akunjalo. UKhongolose sele  ephumelele
kade. [Kwaqhwatywa.] Ngezi nzame ndizama  ukubethelela  nokuqaqambisa  ukuba
masingalali  emqokozweni:  kusekude  engqinibeni.  Mninzi   umntu   ongekabi
nasazisi phandl'  apha.  Enkosi.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of  isiXhosa
speech follows.)

[Prof L M MBADI: Deputy Chair, let me start off by paying tribute to hon  Mr
Pillay  who,  though  he  did  not  make  the  trip,  read  the  report  and
interpreted it the way he did. Thank you, brother.

Two committees,  under  the  leadership  of  the  hon  Chauke  and  the  hon
Saloojee, agreed to undertake trips to various areas in  the  north-east  of
the former Transkei. The  object  of  the  trips  was  to  monitor  delivery
regarding people's needs. The report has been put before Parliament so  that
hon members can analyse it and see how people's needs can be met.

Oppressive governments, here in South Africa and in Africa  generally,  have
always treated rural areas and their people as if they were bastards who  do
not deserve anything modern. Modern technology was only enjoyed by  the  big
cities, such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Durban, etc,  which
led to people leaving their homes to look for  work  in  those  areas  where
there were business and  development  opportunities.  Now  the  people  from
rural areas are crying out, asking, ``Whose children are we? When will  this
freedom and development reach us?''

Hon members, life is tough in the rural areas! Poverty is  rife  there.  The
land is barren, and the people are pale and sad. Soil is eroded;  roads  are
damaged, Aids is killing indiscriminately, both the old and the  young,  and
there is an atmosphere of sadness.  There's  a  funeral  almost  every  day.
People have cried their eyes dry.

This tour was in response to the concerns raised by people in  rural  areas,
such as: ``Our children do not have the  birth  certificates  necessary  for
them to access the benefits provided by the ANC-led Government. Many  people
there still have the apartheid-era identity documents, the dompas, which  do
not indicate the date of birth. Learners who qualify to vote  next  year  do
not have identity documents.

Another problem is that they cannot afford  the  trips  to  and  from  town,
which is the only place where they can get their IDs. And where do they  get
money  to  pay  for  ID  photos?  Applications  for  child  support  grants,
disability and old age pensions are only done in town. Where  is  money  for
the fare?

To address the concerns raised, the committees decided to tour  the  largest
area in the north-eastern Cape, the O R Tambo municipal area. This  city  is
made  up  of  the  following   largely   rural   municipalities:   the   KSD
Municipality, which includes Umtata and Mqanduli; Nyandeni,  which  includes
Libode  and  Ngqeleni;  the  Port  St  Johns  Municipality;   the   Mhlontlo
Municipality, which includes Qumbu and Tsolo; the  Ntabankulu  Municipality;
the Qawukeni Municipality, which is made up  of  Lusikisiki  and  Flagstaff;
the Mbizana Municipality, which is made up of Bhizana.

Following interviews with  high-ranking  officials  in  social  services  in
Umtata, committee members decided that these services  should  be  taken  to
the people instead of the other way round.  That  marked  the  beginning  of
Government's policy of taking services to the people, and since then  things
have never been the same. The system of applications for IDs and grants  was
taken to the people. It started at Mapuzi Technical College, in  Ward  1  at
Mqanduli. There were so many people, all anxious to get help, and it  became
clear that so many people could not be helped in one day.

The committee delegation realised, after talking to the people, that  people
were not sure who qualified for pensions or the  child  support  grant.  But
even more of a problem is the people's  uncertainty  regarding  their  ages.
Many cannot afford the R20 required for ID photos, as a result many  do  not
have IDs.

Be that as it may, we were able to help a  fairly  large  number  of  people
here and there, but it became clear that we could  not  help  everybody.  We
visited all the places we were scheduled to  visit,  and  we  found  similar
conditions in all of them.

Indeed, we did hear critics say: ``These actions by the ANC are an  election
gimmick''. Not true. The ANC has  won  the  elections  already.  [Applause.]
With those words I'm trying to emphasise the fact  that  we  should  not  be
complacent: there is still a lot to be done. There are many  people  without
IDs out there. Thank you. [Applause.]]
Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chair, the report paints a grim picture of  the  level
of social delivery provided to the people in the region.  One  of  the  main
factors coming through is the high  level  of  apathy  displayed  by  public
servants. The reasons may be varied, but if we should  view  public  service
from the perspective of the people, then Government is  not  fulfilling  its
mandate to help those in need.

An example of this apathy is stated in the  early  sections  of  the  report
where the Department of Home Affairs officials wanted  only  to  concentrate
on addressing issues around registration of  births  and  issuing  of  birth
certificates. The joint committee was right to query this approach,  and  to
insist that the Department of Home Affairs  deal  with  the  backlog  of  ID
applications.

The areas visited in  the  Eastern  Cape  show  a  strong  need  for  crisis
intervention to accelerate the process  of  correcting  issues  relating  to
age, threshold, discrepancies, pension  viability,  and  ID  shortages.  The
conditions in which some of the public servants have to work are simply  not
acceptable. The state must be brought to task for allowing its buildings  to
fall into a state of disrepair.

The adage ``Cleanliness is next to godliness'' should apply not only in  the
home, but also in public establishments. Poverty is a burden, we  know,  but
to provide poor service and unattractive  buildings  is  an  insult  to  the
people.  The  public  sector  needs  to  show  people  dignity  by  way   of
professional protocol in person and in work environment.

There are a number of issues raised in the  report  that  indicate  problems
experienced by the areas visited. One of these is the lack  of  finances  to
pay for ID photos to apply for the IDs. The ACDP would add to  the  list  of
recommendations made within the report that the state takes on this  burden,
especially in the poorer areas, and provides the service free of charge.  An
ID is a form of empowerment, and sometimes the only measure  whereby  people
can claim access to state assistance. Without this  document  the  poor  are
further marginalised. The ACDP wishes to see that this  problem  highlighted
in the report enjoys the attention it deserves.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson,  the  MF  has  great  appreciation  for  study
tours, as they allow us to gain a more detailed and  real  analysis  of  the
current situation. The study tour to the Eastern Cape revealed a  number  of
matters of concern that require our urgent attention.

The MF notes the cumbersome task that the Departments of  Home  Affairs  and
of Social Development face. However, we are  challenged  to  take  on  these
duties and responsibilities. Loopholes in both  sectors  are  noted  in  the
above reports. Situations are  unacceptable,  and  the  MF  feels  that  the
matter needs to be addressed with urgency  in  a  cost-effective  and  time-
efficient manner. These matters need to be tackled diligently.

The MF acknowledges the recommendations made by the study  group  which  has
made a great effort in investigating the situation in the Eastern  Cape.  We
have a constitutional duty to these citizens in the  Eastern  Cape,  and  to
all South Africans nationally.

The MF supports recommendations made in both reports, and  hopes  that  this
will receive earnest attention  and  that  every  effort  will  be  made  to
correct the imbalances in the Eastern Cape region. It would  be  appropriate
for these matters to be addressed together to enable a close eye to be  kept
on both sectors' improvement, efficiently and effectively.

The MF thanks the task team for its report, and hopes that its efforts  will
be met by the earnest addressing  of  current  issues  and  recommendations.
Thank you, Chairperson.[Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of the women!]
Hon Chairperson, and hon members, I come here to indicate  its  significance
- I am not going to go into the report. All the speakers who came before  me
have indicated the issues which were observed on this oversight trip to  the
Eastern Cape. They have also alluded to recommendations that have been  made
in the report.

I am going to repeat what I said  on  Tuesday  when  we  were  debating  the
report of the joint budget committee, that indeed the tide has  turned.  The
tide has turned in the sense that today we  are  discussing  issues  without
sweeping them under the carpet. I will always emphasise  that.  Mr  Ferreira
has indicated that he did not  know  that  such  poverty  existed  in  South
Africa.

This is one of the things that shows that the tide has indeed  turned,  even
people who did not know, now know. Now  they  can  passionately  talk  about
things they have seen and witnessed for themselves, and these  are  some  of
the changes we talk about.

I would like to say, hon Ferreira, you are very right. We live  among  those
people experiencing such poverty, as we have always, and I think  that  some
of the members of the IFP can confirm that. These are  some  of  the  things
that we see every  day.  I  would  like  to  say  that  it  also  shows  the
significance of these visits to provinces.

As hon Ramotsamai has indicated, it is only by making visits to these  areas
that we gain the experience to be able to know the reports that we get  from
departments should not just be left at that. We can go to  grassroots  level
and see them. It should not only be done by portfolio committees.

I wonder how many of us can, on our own, especially hon members from the  DA
like the hon Borman, quote people in their  constituencies  who  live  under
such conditions every day? [Interjections.] I am glad that this is the  sign
that the tide has indeed turned. The  hon  members  from  the  DA  say  they
always go to their constituencies and these are signs of the new tide.

We would also like to indicate the significance of co-operative  governance.
We are not going to say because we are in Parliament we  just  leave  issues
to provinces and to local councils. When going on these oversight trips,  we
are able  to  interact  with  departments,  local  councils  and  provincial
departments. They have to know that when we  call  them  and  interact  with
them, it is not on the basis of a boss-employee relationship, it is  on  the
basis of co-operative governance. They must know  that  we  go  to  them  in
order to interact with them, because we make policies and we want to  ensure
that the policies that we are making in Parliament are  being  observed  and
are being implemented adequately.

The other  positive  aspect  which  this  report  brings  out  is  that  two
committees  were  combined.  The  clustering  that  has  been  brought  into
Parliament by the ANC-led Government means that we will  not  point  fingers
at one single department. We are all together in this.

The significance of the Department  of  Home  Affairs  in  the  delivery  of
services cannot be overemphasised.  Unfortunately,  hon  Ferreira,  when  we
indicate this, it is not because  the  report  was  just  indicated,  it  is
because the Department of Home Affairs is very crucial to  the  delivery  of
services. It is not because of anything that  perhaps  somebody  might  have
indicated. These are some of the things that we  indicate,  and  indeed  the
tide has turned.

We move again to the issue of Batho Pele. Whatever we do, we bring in  that.
The tide has indeed turned. [Interjections.] No matter what  you  say.  Yes,
there are still many issues to be addressed with regard to poverty,  but  we
are tackling it, we are not sweeping it under the carpet.

So, hon members, even if you can complain, when we  discuss  the  issues  of
social development and the plight of our people, let  us  not  be  partisan,
because  these  are  issues  that  are  very  sensitive,  and   people   are
experiencing them.

The fact that hon Borman says it is nine years, I do not  know  whether  the
hon member knows the implications of her statement. Do you imply that  these
things were only  introduced  nine  years  ago?  Before  those  nine  years,
nothing was there? Is that what you mean? That is the  implication  of  your
statement. So, be careful what  you  say.  You  might  think  that  you  are
slighting the ANC. You are indeed promoting the ANC,  because  the  ANC  has
only led the Government for the past nine years and here  are  things.  Even
though they have only existed for nine years, they are  there,  hon  member.
So, be careful. [Applause.]

The other thing that this report indicates, we would like to  send  messages
about this to the province of the Eastern Cape, and all the other  provinces
must learn from what we are saying when  we  say,  when  we  deal  with  the
payments of grants, which have been outsourced to  CPS,  and  to  a  certain
extent even though we find that there are problems  within  the  departments
of Government, the delivery by CPS has not been done  properly,  and  it  is
incumbent on the provincial governments to ensure that when they  outsource,
they keep to their service level  agreements  so  that  they  can  push  out
whoever they have agreed with to deliver the  services.  Because  there  are
quite a number of issues that might be raised.

I would like to say that the issue of this co-operative governance,  that  I
would like to come back to, creates an opportunity for us to  link  up  with
provincial portfolio committees. After doing this trip  and  presenting  the
report to the portfolio committee,  we  have  already  interacted  with  the
portfolio committee in the Eastern Cape, and they have assured us that  they
are following up on these issues.

This  is  how  we  should  start  working   and   these   are   the   issues
[Interjections.] No, the MEC did come. It is because you  did  not  come  on
the second trip, and we are not talking about the second trip,  hon  member.
The MEC did come when we went there on the second trip.

I am not going to go into issues of the second trip, but the  issue  that  I
would like to take up is that the tide has turned. Yes, there are  problems,
but all the issues that we have mentioned acknowledge the fact that the ANC-
led Government has turned the tide; and to our people we say:  Do  not  lose
hope, things  are  coming  to  you.  The  services  are  going  to  improve.
[Applause.]

Mnr J J PRETORIUS: Voorsitter, hier is so baie goed hierso dat  ek  eers  so
'n bietjie moet skoonmaak voordat ek kan begin praat.

Voorsitter, dit is vir my aangenaam om vanmiddag aan hierdie debat  deel  te
neem. Alhoewel ek nie die toer kon meemaak nie, het ek as boorling  van  die
Oos-Kaap groot deernis vir die probleme van die Oos-Kaap.

Die ou klein dorpie, of gehuggie, waar ek gebore is - Alicedale - daar  naby
Grahamstad; en daar waar ek skool gegaan het, op Dordrecht; en  ander  dorpe
waar ek ook op skool was, Indwe en Lady Frere - dit is dié dele wat  ek  ken
en waar ek weet dat daar inderdaad baie armoede heers. Dit is jammer dat  'n
mens vanmiddag eintlik so 'n swartgallige prentjie van die Oos-Kaap het.
Ek hoop dat die departement alles in sy vermoë sal doen  om  seker  te  maak
dat die dienste wat aan die mense van die Oos-Kaap gelewer word  van  so  'n
gehalte sal wees dat hulle ook inderdaad daarop trots kan wees.

Elkeen wat vanmiddag gepraat het,  het  bevestig  dat  daar  'n  tekort  aan
personeel is, maar  dit  is  meer  as  dit.  Dis  inderdaad  'n  tekort  aan
opgeleide personeel. Dis 'n tekort aan rekenaars en as  daar  rekenaars  is,
is   hulle   baie   keer   ook   verouderd.   Dan   het   ons    onvoldoende
kantoorfasiliteite, 'n tekort aan  algemene  dienslewering,  byvoorbeeld  'n
tekort aan mobiele eenhede en addisionele kantore.

'n  Ander  saak  wat  vanmiddag  deur  ons  agb  President  ongelukkig   nie
aangespreek is nie, is die probleem rondom  die  bedrag  wat  toegeken  moet
word vir die ID-veldtog. 'n Bedrag van R15 miljoen is  aanvanklik  toegeken,
en R10 miljoen daarvan is alreeds deur die  departement  gespandeer  en  die
departement het 'n addisionele  R65  miljoen  aangevra  en  tot  op  hierdie
stadium is dit nog nie deur die Tesourie toegeken nie.
Voorsitter, dít gaan bepaal of hierdie ID-veldtog inderdaad 'n  sukses  gaan
wees, of dit 'n suksesvolle veldtog gaan wees. Daarom hoop ek,  en  ek  doen
'n beroep op die voorsitter en op die komiteelede, ons sal  seker  maak  dat
hierdie geld gekry word sodat die ID-veldtog inderdaad suksesvol  deurgevoer
kan word.

Ek dink ook die departement het nogtans, ten spyte van  die  probleme,  goed
gevaar as 'n mens  dink  aan  die  tekort  aan  fondse  en  die  tekort  aan
personeel. Vanaf 1 April  tot  die  einde  van  Augustus  vanjaar,  het  die
departement 1,3 miljoen aansoeke vir ID's ontvang. Net meer  as  'n  miljoen
aansoeke, 1 015 000, is tot op hierdie stadium uitgereik. Soveel as 292  000
moet nog uitgereik word.

Die ander probleem wat ek graag wil aanspreek,  gaan  oor  die  kwessie  van
onwettige  immigrante.  Dis  inderdaad  'n  krisis.   Die   departement   se
amptenare, en ander gerugte wat die rondte  doen,  sê  dat  mense  die  laat
registrasie  van   geboortes   misbruik   om   uiteindelik   Suid-Afrikaanse
burgerskap in die hande te kry. Ek het nie klinkklare bewyse  nie.  Uit  die
inligting wat aan my oorgedra is, kan mens aflei dat daar veral sedert  1994
baie mense is - en dis nie noodwendig jong mense nie; ouer mense 30, 40,  en
50 jaar en ouer - wat aansoek doen vir laat registrasie en  dan  uiteindelik
gebeur dit dat daardie persoon wat aansoek doen om 'n ID,  dit  doen  om  'n
Suid-Afrikaanse burger te word.

Ek dink dat as daar nou iets gedoen moet  word  aan  hierdie  saak,  wil  ek
vanmiddag 'n beroep doen dat die Regering of die  departement  'n  ondersoek
na hierdie saak instel om hiervan seker te maak. Dis werkgeleenthede en  dis
behuising en dis ander geriewe en infrastruktuur wat in die proses vir  alle
Suid-Afrikaners gebruik kan word wat nie na hulle toe kom nie. Baie  dankie,
en ek hoop ons kan die probleme van  die  departement  oplos.  Baie  dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J J PRETORIUS: Chairperson, there are so many things here  that  I  need
to clear a space before I can start speaking.

Chairperson,  it  is  my  pleasure  to  participate  in  this  debate   this
afternoon. Although I could not be part of the tour, I, as a native  of  the
Eastern Cape, have great compassion for the problems of the Eastern Cape.

The small town, or settlement, where I was  born  -  Alicedale  -  close  to
Grahamstown; and where I went to  school,  in  Dordrecht,  and  other  towns
where I attended school, Indwe and Lady Frere - those are the areas  that  I
am familiar with and where I know that poverty is indeed rife. It is a  pity
that one gets such a bleak picture of the Eastern Cape this afternoon.

I hope that the department will do everything in its power  to  ensure  that
the services that are rendered to the people of  the  Eastern  Cape  are  of
such a quality that they can indeed also be proud of it.

Everyone who has spoken  this  afternoon  has  confirmed  that  there  is  a
shortage of staff, but it is more than that. It is in  fact  a  shortage  of
trained personnel. It is a lack of computers and  if  there  are  computers,
they are often obsolete. Then we  have  insufficient  office  facilities,  a
lack of general service delivery, for example a lack  of  mobile  units  and
additional offices.

Another matter that our hon President unfortunately  did  not  address  this
afternoon, is the problem concerning the amount  that  should  be  allocated
for the ID campaign. An amount of R15 million  was  initially  awarded,  and
R10 million of that has  already  been  spent  by  the  department  and  the
department has requested  an  additional  R65  million  and  at  this  stage
Treasury has not awarded it yet.

Chairperson, this will determine whether this ID campaign will indeed  be  a
success; if it will be a successful campaign. That is  why  I  hope,  and  I
call upon the chairperson and the committee members,  that  we  will  ensure
that these funds are  obtained  so  that  the  ID  campaign  can  indeed  be
implemented successfully.

I also think, in spite of the problems, that the department  has  done  well
if one thinks about the lack of funds and the staff shortage. From  1  April
to the  end  of  August  this  year  the  department  received  1,3  million
applications for IDs. Just more than a  million  applications,  1  015  000,
have been issued to date. As many as 292 000 still have to be issued.

The other problem that I  would  like  to  address  concerns  the  issue  of
illegal immigrants. This is indeed a crisis. Officials from  the  department
and other rumours going around  claim  that  people  are  abusing  the  late
registration  of  births  in  order  to  eventually  obtain  South   African
citizenship. I do not have any concrete evidence. From the information  that
was conveyed to me, one  can  deduce  that  particularly  since  1994,  many
people - and it is not necessarily young people; older  people,  of  30,  40
and 50 years and older - have applied for  late  registration  and  then  it
eventually happens that that person who  applies  for  an  ID  document,  is
doing so to become a South African citizen.

I think that if something has to be done about this matter now,  I  want  to
call upon the  Government  or  the  department  to  investigate  and  obtain
certainty about it. It is job opportunities and it  is  housing  and  it  is
other  amenities  and  infrastructure  that  could  be  used  by  all  South
Africans, but they are not getting what they deserve. Thank you  very  much,
and I hope that we can solve  the  department's  problems.  Thank  you  very
much.]

Mnu  M  U  KALAKO:  Mhlalingaphambili  namalungu  ePalamente  abalulekileyo,
utyelelo lweKomiti yezeKhaya  yalapha  ePalamente  eMpuma  Koloni,  ngakumbi
kummandla  obusakwaziwa   njengeTranskei   phantsi   kombuso   wocalucalulo,
lusibonise ukuba kuninzi ekufuneka  sikwenzile  singamalungu  eNdlu  yoWiso-
mthetho malunga nesigqeba sikaRhulumente sezekhaya.

Kuyinyaniso  ecace  njengebhokhwe  ehlungwini  ukuba  ngaphandle   kwezazisi
neziqinisekiso    zokuzalwa    kwabantwana    kunye    nokubhaliswa    kwabo
basishiyileyo, asinakho ukwenza ukuba abantu baseMzantsi  Afrika  bafikelele
kwiinkonzo zikaRhulumente. Umpoposho kaRhulumente wokuba abantu  mababhalise
abantwana ukuze babe nezazisi nokuba baye kwiiofisi zeSebe  lezeKhaya  ukuze
bafumane izazisi, kufuneka siwukhuthaze ngamandla.

Abantu baseMzantsi Afrika kufuneka bazi  ukuba  uRhulumente  akenzeli  ukuba
abantu bakwazi  ukubhalisela  uvoto,  koko  wenzela  ukuba  abantu  abadala,
amaxhego namaxhegwazana akwazi ukufumana indodla okanye inkamnkam yawo  kuba
ngaphandle kwesazisi esikuchaza ukuba wazalwa nini,  akunakukwazi  ukuxhamla
indodla.

Ukanti nokubhaliswa kwabantwana nabakhubazekileyo  kubalulekile  ukuze  nabo
bakwazi  ukuxhamla  kwimali  athi  ayikhuphe  rhoqo  ngenyanga  uRhulumente.
Ukutsho oko ke bantu baseMzantsi  Afrika,  eli  phulo  lokuphuma  sijikeleze
sinicenga  sinithundeza  ukuba  nibhalise   abantwana,   nithathe   izazisi,
ngokunjalo nibhalise nabakhubazekileyo, liza kuqhubeka de  soneliseke  ukuba
wonke   umntu   waseMzantsi   Afrika   ubhalisile.   Ukanti   ke   kananjalo
siyanibongoza ukuba xa ninezazisi, hambani niye kubhalisela  unyulo  lonyaka
ozayo  ukuze   nikwazi   ukukhetha   umbutho   onikhulule   emakhamandeleni,
engcinezelweni,  esihogweni  sikaFaro,  wanifaka  endleleni   eya   eKanana;
umbutho ofungayo ukuba awusoze uphumle ningekangeni eKanana. [Kwaqhwatywa.]

Kolu tyelelo zininzi iingxaki esiye saziqwalasela xa  abantu  befuna  uncedo
kwiSebe  lezeKhaya.  Ezinye  zazo  esithe  saziphawula   zezi   zilandelayo:
Eyokuqala, yeyokuba  abantwana  abangenabazali  kuba  nzima  ukuba  benzelwe
iziqiniseko zokuzalwa kanti nabo sebefike eminyakeni  yokuba  babe  nezazisi
baba nengxaki ukuba babhaliswe bafumane izazisi. Okwesibini, amagama  abantu
imihla kunye neminyaka yabo yokuzalwa ibhalwe  ngempazamo  kwizazisi,  zabo,
nto leyo eyenza ukuba babe neengxaki ekufumaneni amalungelo abo.

Okwesithathu,  ezinye  iindawo  elizisebenzisayo  iSebe   lezeKhaya   azikho
mgangathweni, neendawo ekugcinwa kuzo  izazisi  nezinto  zokusebenza  zesebe
azikho   mgangathweni.   Okwesine,   kusekho   izazisi   ezininzi    kakhulu
neziqinisekiso zokuzalwa ezinamagama  abantwana  ezihleli  kwiiofisi  zesebe
lezeKhaya  yaye  ezi  ziqinisekiso  nezi  zazisi  azikhuselekanga  kwaphela.
KwiMpuma Koloni kuphela kukho ama-34 872  ezazisi  ezingekafikeleli  kubantu
bazo.

Okwesihlanu,  kukho  nengxaki   yokulahleka   kwezazisi   kwiiofisi   zeSebe
lezeKhaya   kuba   ziqhekezwa   kakhulu.   Loo   nto   ke   yenziwa   kukuba
azikhuselekanga. Okwesithandathu, ukubuyiselwa kwezi  zazisi  neziqinisekiso
zokuzalwa kubantu bazo yenye yeengxaki zeSebe lezeKhaya.

Iziphakamiso  esithe  sazenza  kwiSebe  lezeKhaya   ukulungisa   le   ngxaki
nesiziphakamisayo  apha  kwiNdlu  ngokubanzi  zezi  zilandelayo:  Esokuqala,
sesokuba isebe kufuneka  lijonge  indlela  elinokuyisebenzisa  xa  lisebenza
emaphandleni  nakwiindawo  ekunzima  ukufikelela  kuzo.  Okwesibini,  ukuhla
komdla kubasebenzi beSebe lezeKhaya, ngakumbi kimimandla ethile  kunye  nasi
ofisini  ezimiselwe  okwexeshana  kufuneka  kuqwalaselwe  ngokungxama,  yaye
kulungiswe.

Okwesithathu, kufuneka kunyuswe  umgangatho  wabaphathi  eziofisini  zesebe.
Uvavanyo  lwabaphathi  nabasebenzi  kufuneka   lwenziwe   rhoqo.   Okwesine,
ukujongwa kwesimo seendawo zokusebenza zesebe  lezeKhaya  kufuneka  kwenziwe
ngokukhawuleza okudibene  nokungxama.  Oku  kufuneka  kwenziwe  kubanjiswene
neSebe leMisebenzi kaRhulumente.

Okwesihlanu, zonke iiofisi zeSebe kufuneka zibe nekhompyutha,  ngakumbi  ezo
zisemaphandleni    nakwiindawo     ezingafikelelekiyo,     ukuze     zikwazi
ukuqhagamshelana  neofisi  enkulu   ePitoli.   Okwesithandathu,   ukungoneli
kwenani labasebenzi eziofisini kufuneka kuqwalaselwe ngokukhawuleza.

Okwesixhenxe, urhwaphilizo eziofisini  zeSebe  kufuneka  kohlwaywe  kanobom.
Kufuneka  abo  bamkela  ukunyotywa  ukuze  benze  umsebenzi  wabo   babanjwe
bavalelwe yaye bohlwaywe kakhulu. Okwesibhozo, sicela  bonke  abantu  abathe
bangamaxhoba okunyotyiswa ukuze  bafumane  uncedo  kwiSebe,  baqhagamshelane
neofisi  yoMhlalingaphambili  weKomiti  yeSebe   lezeKhaya   kwezi   nombolo
zilandelayo: 021 403 3984. Lolweofisi yakhe ke  olo  ucingo.  Olunye  ucingo
abanokulitsalela lolo lweselfoni oluthi:

083 7873984. Ukanti xa ufuna ukumfaksela, ungamfumana kule nombolo: 021  403
2070.    Enkosi,    Mhlalingaphambili.    [Laphela     ixesha.][Kwaqhatywa.]
(Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Mr M U KALAKO: Mr Chairperson and hon members of Parliament, the  visit  of
the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs to the Eastern Cape, especially  the
area formerly known as Transkei under the apartheid  government,  showed  us
that there is a lot that we, as members of the National  Assembly,  have  to
do in relation to the national Department of Home Affairs.

It is abundantly clear that without an identification document and  a  birth
certificate for children and without the registration of  deaths  we  cannot
enable the people of South Africa to access  Government  services.  We  must
vigorously support the call that Government has  made  to  the  effect  that
parents must register children so that they  have  identification  documents
and also that they need to go to the  offices  of  Home  Affairs  so  as  to
obtain identification documents.
The people of South Africa need to know that Government does not  do  so  in
order for them to be able to register for voting, but the  Government  wants
the elderly, the grandmothers and grandfathers, to be able to  access  their
pension or grant, because without the identification document, which  states
when you were born, you will not be able to access grants.

On the  other  hand,  registering  children  and  the  handicapped  is  also
important so that they too can benefit  from  Government's  monthly  grants.
People of South Africa, this means that this campaign  of  going  around  to
people and persuading them, encouraging them to register  the  children,  to
collect identity documents  and  also  to  register  the  handicapped,  will
continue until we are satisfied that all the citizens of  South  Africa  are
registered.

On the other hand, we appeal that, once  you  have  obtained  your  identity
document, you go and register for next  year's  election  so  that  you  can
choose the  organisation  which  freed  you  from  the  shackles,  from  the
oppression, from the hell of pharaoh, and put you on the road to Canaan,  an
organisation that swears that it will never rest before  you  enter  Canaan.
[Applause.]

There are many problems, experienced by people  at  Home  Affairs,  that  we
looked at during the visit. Some of them that we  noticed  are  as  follows:
Firstly, children who have no parents have difficulty in being  issued  with
a certificate. Secondly, the names of  people,  their  dates  of  birth  and
their ages have been  incorrectly  recorded  in  their  identity  documents,
which gives rise to them experiencing problems when they have to  get  their
benefits.

Thirdly, the other venues which the Department of Home Affairs makes use  of
are not up to standard; the places where the identity documents are kept  as
well as the tools they use are not  up  to  standard.  Fourthly,  there  are
still many identity documents and children's  birth  certificates  lying  in
the office of the Department of Home  Affairs  and  these  certificates  and
identity documents are not safe at all. In the Eastern Cape alone there  are
34 872 identity documents which have not reached their owners.

Fifthly, there is also the problem of loss of identity  documents  from  the
offices of the Department of Home Affairs, because they are being burgled  a
lot. And that is caused by the fact that they are not safe. Sixthly,  taking
these identity documents and the  birth  certificates  to  their  owners  is
another problem in the Department of Home affairs.

To address this problem, the proposals we made to  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs, which we also  make  to  this  House  at  large,  are  as  follows:
Firstly, the department must look for a method it can use  when  working  in
the rural areas and in areas where it is  difficult  to  reach  the  people.
Secondly, the decline in interest among the employees of the  Department  of
Home Affairs, especially in areas that  are  in  certain  districts  and  in
offices which have been set up temporarily, must be given attention  quickly
and must be corrected.
Thirdly, the standard of the managers of the offices of  the  Department  of
Home Affairs must be raised.  Evaluation  of  managers  and  workers  should
happen often. Fourthly, an inspection of the conditions of the workplace  of
the Department of Home Affairs must be done as  quickly  as  possible.  This
must happen in collaboration with the national Department of Public Works.

Fifthly, all the offices of the department must have  computers,  especially
those in the rural areas and areas which cannot be reached easily,  so  that
they are able to be in contact with the head office  in  Pretoria.  Sixthly,
understaffing in offices should be given attention speedily.

Seventhly, corruption  should  be  severely  punishable.  Those  who  accept
bribes to do their work should be arrested, detained and punished  severely.
Eighthly, we ask all those who, in order for  them  to  receive  help,  were
victims of bribery to contact the office of the Chairman  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Home Affairs at the following numbers: 021 403  3984.  That  is
his office number. The other number they can use is a cellphone number:  083
787 3984. On the other hand, if you wish to fax him, you can  reach  him  at
021 403 2070. Thank you, Mr Chairperson. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.
