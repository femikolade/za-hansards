                     CURRENT ROUND OF TALKS IN THE SUDAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes that the current round of talks by the  Sudanese  parties,
        sponsored by IGAD  (Intergovernmental  Authority  on  Development),
        calls upon the warring parties to make some  hard  choices  in  the
        coming weeks;


   (2)      is of the view that -


        (a)      if this, the best chance of peace in 20 years, is  missed,
              the war in the Sudan, which has already cost  over  a  million
              lives, may become more deadly and destructive than ever;


        (b)      it is crucial, not only  for  the  participants  from  the
              region, but also for the mediating countries and the  official
              observers (from the US, the UK, Norway, Italy, the AU and  the
              UN) to fully support the process;


        (c)      currently  there  are  disturbing  signs  of  a  breakdown
              between the main parties concerned, i.e. the government of the
              Sudan and the SPLM, that they need to show greater flexibility
              and that, if they allow a complete breakdown, it may  be  very
              difficult to put a peace process back on track in  the  Sudan;
              and


        (d)      both the government of the Sudan and the SPLM need to know
              that a price will have to be paid  by  any  side  deliberately
              wrecking the talks; and


   (3)      calls upon the South African  Government  and  the  Minister  of
        Foreign Affairs  to  also  support  the  process  and  to  use  our
        influence to keep the parties in the Sudan talking and the  process
        on track towards a genuine, acceptable, practical, sustainable  and
        peaceful transition and towards becoming a  nation  at  peace  with
        itself and the world.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              SUCCESSFUL CONVICTION OF GOLDEN ARROW BUS COMPANY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chairperson, I rise to move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes with appreciation the successful conviction of the  Golden
         Arrow Bus Company for fraud after a two year investigation  by  the
         Scorpions Elite Unit;


   (2)      also notes that the bus company was  convicted  for  incorrectly
         linking government-subsidised  passenger  cards  between  1997  and
         2000; and


   (3)      further notes that the state stands to receive R57 million  from
         this conviction.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
                       LAUNCH OF RAIL SAFETY CAMPAIGN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes the launching of the Rail Safety Campaign in the  Northern
         Cape last week;


   (2)      further notes that this campaign strives  to  ensure  the  total
         safety of commuters,  residents  living  adjacent  to  the  railway
         reserves and employees of Spoornet;


   (3)      also notes that this campaign will educate communities about the
         inherent dangers of the railway lines;


   (4)      believes that this campaign  will  further  assist  in  stopping
         cable theft; and


   (5)      therefore  calls  on  communities  to  cooperate  with  Spoornet
         authorities in this campaign.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                              SALUTE TO THE UDF

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B N DLULANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      notes that on Sunday, 31st August 2003, more than 40 veterans of
         the struggle in the Western  Cape,  amongst  whom  was  the  former
         member of the Council, Mr Christmas Tinto, were saluted  for  their
         contributions to the work of the  United  Democratic  Front  (UDF);
         and


   (2)      in recognition of the major contribution by these giants of  the
         struggle, therefore joins in saluting  these  heroes  and  heroines
         for their dedication in the struggle against apartheid.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       PUBLIC PROTECTOR AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  as
hon  members  will  remember,  the  Office  of  the  Public  Protector   was
established  by  the   Constitution   to   investigate   matters   such   as
maladministration in connection with the  affairs  of  Government,  improper
conduct or undue delay by a person performing a  public  function,  improper
or dishonest acts with respect to public  money  and  improper  or  unlawful
enrichment of a person performing any public function.

The Constitution regulates the procedure to be followed  in  appointing  the
Public Protector. In terms  of  section  193(4)  of  the  Constitution,  the
President, on the recommendation of the National Assembly, must appoint  the
Public Protector. Provision is further made that the National Assembly  must
for that purpose  recommend  a  person  nominated  by  a  committee  of  the
Assembly  that  is  proportionally  composed  of  members  of  all   parties
represented in the Assembly and approved by the  Assembly  by  a  resolution
adopted with a supporting vote of  at  least  60%  of  the  members  of  the
Assembly.

The Public Protector Act of 1994, to which I refer  as  the  principal  act,
provides for the appointment of one or  more  Deputy  Public  Protectors  to
assist the Public Protector in the performance of his or her  functions.  In
terms of section 3(2) of the principal Act,  the  Minister  responsible  for
the administration of justice  must,  after  consultation  with  the  Public
Protector, appoint one or more persons  as  Deputy  Public  Protectors.  The
Public Protector is included in Chapter 9 of the Constitution,  which  deals
with state institutions that strengthens our  constitutional  democracy.  In
other words, it is part of the so-called Chapter 9 institutions.

In terms  of  the  Constitution,  these  institutions  are  independent  and
accountable only to the National Assembly. There have  been  arguments  that
the present appointment mechanism for Deputy Public Protectors, namely  that
they  must  be  appointed  by  the  Cabinet  member  responsible   for   the
administration of justice, erodes the independence of that office,  as  such
a person may eventually assume the duties of the Public Protector. In  order
to address those arguments, the Bill  before  the  Council  today  seeks  to
introduce a new appointing mechanism for the Deputy Public Protector.

It also contains amendments relating to the Office of the Public  Protector.
Provision is, for example, made that a  person  who  has  for  a  cumulative
period of at least 10 years been a  member  of  Parliament,  will  now  also
qualify to be appointed as Public Protector. I have  been  informed  that  a
concern has been raised that this new provision opens the door for  possible
political appointments to the Office of the Public Protector.  That  concern
is, in my view, obviated by the provisions of section 181(2) and (5) of  the
Constitution,  which  provide,  among  other  things,  that  the  Chapter  9
institutions must be impartial and must exercise their  powers  and  perform
their functions without fear, favour or prejudice  and  are  accountable  to
the National Assembly.

The Bill further contains a few minor  technical  amendments,  bringing  the
terminology in the principal Act in line with latest developments.  For  the
convenience of the hon members who, due to their very  busy  schedules,  did
not have an opportunity to read the Bill, I would like  to  briefly  mention
some of the new principles relating to the appointment of the Deputy  Public
Protector that are contained in the Bill.

Firstly, provision is made for the appointment of  only  one  Deputy  Public
Protector. He or she will be appointment for a period  not  exceeding  seven
years, but may at the end of his or her term of office  be  reappointed  for
one  additional  term.  Secondly,  the  Deputy  Public  Protector  will   be
appointed by the President on the recommendation of the  National  Assembly.
Provision has been made that the Assembly must recommend a person  nominated
by a committee of the Assembly and approved by the Assembly by a  resolution
adopted with a supporting vote  of  the  majority  of  the  members  of  the
Assembly. Thirdly, the Deputy Public  Protector  must  be  a  South  African
citizen who is a fit and proper person to hold such office and who has,  for
a cumulative period of at least 10  years,  for  example,  practised  as  an
advocate or attorney or been a member of Parliament.  Fourthly,  the  Deputy
Public Protector  may  be  removed  from  office  only  on  the  grounds  of
misconduct, incapacity or incompetence, and on the adoption by the  National
Assembly of a resolution calling for his or her removal from office. Such  a
resolution must be adopted with a supporting  vote  of  a  majority  of  the
members of the Assembly.

I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank the  Chairperson
of the Select Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,  Kgoshi
Mokoena, and the members of the committee for the hard work  they  have  put
into the consideration of this  piece  of  legislation.  I  have  noted  the
amendments to the Bill which are being proposed in  the  select  committee's
report on the Bill. I am of the opinion that those  amendments  reflect  the
high standard that this committee has set for itself in its approach to  and
processing of legislation in general.

Lastly, I  would  like  to  mention  that  a  directorate  was  specifically
established  in  my  department  to  give  effect  to   the   constitutional
responsibility contained in section 181(3) of the Constitution, namely  that
organs of state must assist  and  protect  the  Chapter  9  institutions  to
ensure their independence, impartiality,  dignity  and  effectiveness.  That
directorate  is  responsible  for,  among  other   things,   promoting   and
maintaining  communication  channels  between   the   relevant   Chapter   9
institutions and state departments, ensuring that proposals  emanating  from
and recommendations made in reports of the Chapter  9  institutions  receive
the  required  attention  after  reviewing  and  evaluating   the   existing
budgetary processes and financial arrangements applicable to the  Chapter  9
institutions. It could be mentioned that  some  good  progress  has  already
been made in this regard.

As the Deputy Minister for Justice and  Constitutional  Development  pointed
out when she addressed the National  Assembly  on  the  provisions  of  this
Bill, the Chapter 9 institutions are now able to  liaise  closely  with  the
department on any problems that they might experience and  which  they  feel
could have an  effect  on  their  independence,  impartiality,  dignity  and
effectiveness. I would also like to make use of this opportunity  to  invite
the relevant Chapter 9 institutions to approach this  directorate  with  any
problems that they might indeed experience in  this  regard.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson,  once  more  I  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity to thank the hon Minister and his department for coming up  with
this progressive piece of legislation.

We are experiencing something very unusual. Hon members  would  recall  that
the principal Act, as the Minister rightly  said,  allows  the  Minister  to
appoint Deputy Public Protectors, while the Public  Protector  is  appointed
by the President. However, the  amendment  before  us  is  that  the  Deputy
Public Protector will now be  appointed  in  the  same  way  as  the  Public
Protector. This simply means that the Minister will no  longer  appoint  the
Deputy Public Protector.

I want members to follow me correctly regarding this proposal so  that  they
understand what is happening here. This proposal was triggered by  the  fact
that it is possible that the Deputy Public Protector may  eventually  assume
the duties of the  Public  Protector.  Therefore,  we  are  dealing  with  a
delicate and very sensitive office, an office that is independent  and  that
must be respected, supported and trusted by all South Africans. That  means,
again, that the Deputy  Public  Protector  will  now  be  appointed  by  the
President with the involvement of Parliament.

I know hon members can remember how the incumbent is appointed, so I am  not
going to  bore  them  by  outlining  the  details  of  how  this  office  is
appointed, because by doing so  I  will  be  preaching  the  gospel  to  the
converted.

I said that we are experiencing something very unusual. What do  I  mean  by
that? Here is the hon Minister, who is saying that he  no  longer  wants  to
appoint Deputy Public Protectors. He says: Let this exercise be done by  the
President and Parliament. Where,  if  not  in  the  ANC,  could  you  get  a
Minister who was not selfish and not greedy?

He is doing all this in the best interests of this office,  because  it  has
to be independent and trusted by everybody. We salute you, hon Minister.  We
are  not  suprised,  as  you  are  the  product  of  OR,  the   product   of
Langalibalele Dube, the product of Oom Gov and others - this is  the  school
where the Minister comes from.

The second issue in this Bill addresses the kind of people  who  are  to  be
appointed to this office - people who qualify to be appointed as the  Public
Protector or the Deputy Public Protector. Let me confess that  when  dealing
with the clause that outlines how MPs can qualify to  be  appointed  as  the
Public  Protector  or  the  Deputy  Public  Protector,  I  had  to  use   my
traditional powers to call for calm from our committee members, because  the
gloves were off; they were down to their knuckles.

What caused members to fume - for our colleagues who do not  serve  on  this
committee to understand - were clauses 2  and  4(2A).  Both  clauses  direct
that an MP can only be appointed as  the  Public  Protector  or  the  Deputy
Public Protector if he  or  she  has,  amongst  other  requirements,  for  a
cumulative period of at least 10 years been a member of Parliament.

This did not go down well  with  my  committee  members,  except  one.  This
proposal was seen as catering for MPs who served in the previous  government
only, excluding the current MPs who started, for example, in  1994.  Let  us
assume this clause was in place last year. That simply means  or  tells  you
that the current Public Protector would not have  been  appointed.  That  is
what ruffled feathers in the committee that day.

I'm happy to report that the select committee brought about some  amendments
to this clause  and  these  were,  as  always,  accepted  by  the  portfolio
committee when we  consulted  them.  This  is  because  an  MP  can  now  be
appointed as the Public Protector or the Deputy Public Protector  if  he  or
she has served as an MP for five years,  plus  the  other  requirements,  as
stated in the Bill, that would make up 10 years.

In simple terms this means that it  must  be  the  period  you  should  have
served as an MP and those requirements that must  form  the  10  years,  for
example, if one is a judge of a High Court, is admitted as  an  advocate  or
attorney, plus the other requirements.

My  colleague  Adv  Lawrence  Lever  had  some  reservations   about   these
amendments. I hope that  over  the  weekend  he  reconsidered  his  position
because I trust him. He is a seasoned politician, so I know  he  would  have
done just that.

Once more, I want to thank my committee members for doing what  is  expected
of us as the NCOP committees. I once said in this House that no  matter  how
deep the bottle is, the cream will always be on top. I hope that all  of  us
will do the right thing and support this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, as the members  of  the
select committee know, I was opposed to the Bill in the committee.  The  hon
Kgoshi Mokoena, the chairperson of the select  committee,  offered  to  come
and see  me  in  my  office  to  persuade  me  to  see  things  differently.
Unfortunately, the hon Kgoshi did not come to  my  office.  The  hon  Kgoshi
knows that he would always be welcome to my office and that  I  respect  his
views.

However, it was not him, but my own caucus that persuaded me  to  change  my
views. The basis on which my caucus persuaded me to change my views is  that
this Bill introduces a mechanism in terms  of  which  a  public  process  is
followed for the appointment of the Deputy Public  Protector.  This  process
is similar to the one followed for the appointment of the  Public  Protector
in the present Act,  and  this  is  commendable.  However,  the  concerns  I
expressed in the committee, I believe,  are  still  valid  and  need  to  be
expressed in this open and public debate which  we  are  having  before  the
nation today.

In order to place these concerns in a proper context, one must  examine  the
nature  of  the  state  institutions  supporting  democracy,  the  so-called
Chapter 9 institutions. The nature  of  these  institutions  is  most  aptly
described in section 181 (2) and (3) - which the hon Minister referred to  -
of our Constitution. Subsection 2 goes:


  These institutions are independent, and subject only to the  Constitution
  and the law, and they must be impartial and must excercise  their  powers
  and perform their functions without fear, favour or prejudice.
Subsection 3 goes:


  Other organs of state,  through  legislative  and  other  measures,  must
  assist  and  protect  these  institutions  to  ensure  the  independence,
  impartiality, dignity and effectiveness of these institutions.

In order to be effective, these institutions need not only  be  independent,
but also be perceived as independent by the public at large. The problem  is
that this Bill, in clauses 2 and 4, introduces a new clause,  1A  subsection
3(e) and 2A subsection 4(d), providing a new  ground  to  qualify  for  this
position. With 10 years experience as a member of Parliament, there are  two
difficulties with this position.

Firstly, it undermines the public perception of  independence.  This  is  so
because, no matter how tenuous the connection between the candidate and  the
Government of the day may  be,  to  appoint  someone  like  that  -  however
remotely connected - would undermine the perception of independence. I  must
stress that this is so regardless of the Government of the day. My  view  in
this  regard  would  not  change  even  when   my   own   party   comes   to
power.[Laughter.]

Secondly, this ground makes no provision or sets no  requirements  for  what
qualifications or experience a  member  of  Parliament  needs  in  order  to
qualify for the job. I think that a Public Protector or his deputy  must  of
necessity have a legal qualification or some connection  to  legal  training
or experience. However, this is not required in  the  present  subsection  3
and 4(d) as they stand at present. However, despite my  concerns,  my  party
supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, Mr Lever. I am  sure  it
is because of that that I decided to withdraw from participating, because  I
wanted to deal directly with you.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon  members,  the  fact
that of  the  nine  institutions  supporting  constitutional  democracy  the
Office of the Public Protector  is  mentioned  first  in  the  Constitution,
underlines the importance attached to this institution in our democracy.

The amendments before us this afternoon seek to regulate  matters  connected
to the Office of the Public Protector and,  to  a  larger  extent,  regulate
procedures and conditions for the appointment of a Deputy Public  Protector.


Here we observe critical ways and means aimed at ensuring that the  somewhat
anomalous situation which prevailed in allowing the Minister to be  involved
in the appointment of deputy public protectors, is addressed  by  allocating
that responsibility to the President and Parliament. The Bill also seeks  to
give more clarity on the levels of authority between  the  Public  Protector
and his or her deputy.

In its deliberations, our committee focused for some time  on  the  criteria
for the appointment of the Public Protector. The majority of us  shared  the
view that some of the requirements for appointment as Public  Protector  did
not make real sense, hence we opted for the combination  of  experiences  in
order to level the playing field,  to  cater  for  categories  of  potential
candidates who would otherwise had been excluded.

In doing this we were informed by the  practical  situations  which  dictate
that  the  Office  of  the  Public  Protector  is  not  necessarily  a  one-
dimensional institution serving as a guardian of  the  public  interests  on
judicial matters only. We might recall  that  recently  the  Office  of  the
Public Protector  was  called  upon  to  take  on  review  some  matters  of
commercial interest and to weigh this interest against  the  greater  public
interest,  with  particular  reference  to  the  principles   of   fairness,
transparency and honesty.

When such matters come under review, the concerned legislature will have  to
investigate whether a  legal  instrument  such  as  the  Executive  Members'
Ethics Act of 1998, and your own code of conduct as  members  of  Parliament
have  been  complied  with.  Our  action,  therefore,  to  amend   the   set
requirements was motivated by our commitment to sustaining the  dignity  and
decorum which is bestowed on the Office of the  Public  Protector,  so  that
every citizen of this  country  can  feel  the  benefits  of  constitutional
democracy.

We should, therefore, support this amending Bill. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, die belangrikheid van die  instelling  van  die
Openbare  Beskermer  as  een  van  die  staatsinstellings  wat  grondwetlike
demokrasie ondersteun kan nie maklik oorbeklemtoon word nie  en  daarom  wil
ek dit vandag weer beklemtoon.

Die onafhanklikheid van die Openbare Beskermer en die  feit  dat  hy  of  sy
slegs teenoor die Parlement  verantwoordingspligtig  is,  is  eweneens  baie
belangrik. Dit spreek vanself dat indien dit verwag  word  van  die  persoon
wat die posisie van die Openbare Beskermer beklee, dit ook verwag  kan  word
van die persoon wat die posisie van die  Adjunk-Openbare  Beskermer  beklee.
Daardie persoon moet met dieselfde mate van onafhanklikheid en gesag as  die
Openbare Beskermer kan optree, en daarom behoort  daardie  persoon  ook  met
dieselfde mate van onafhanklikheid en gesag beklee te word.

Tans is die posisie egter dat daar meer  as  een  Adjunk-Openbare  Beskermer
kan wees wat deur die kabinetslid verantwoordelik vir regspleging  aangestel
moet word. Die wysiging van hierdie  wetsontwerp  stel  nou  voor  dat  daar
slegs een Adjunk-Openbare Beskermer moet wees wat, soos die  geval  met  die
Openbare Beskermer,  deur  die  President  met  die  betrokkenheid  van  die
departement  aangestel  moet  word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[The importance of the establishment of the Public Protector as one  of  the
state institutions that supports constitutional democracy cannot  easily  be
overemphasised, and therefore I want to emphasise it again today.

The independence of the Public Protector, and the fact that  he  or  she  is
only accountable to Parliament, is also very important. It stands to  reason
that if this is expected from  the  person  who  occupies  the  position  of
Public Protector, it can also be expected from the person who  occupies  the
position of Deputy Public Protector. This person should be able to act  with
the same degree of independence and authority as the Public  Protector,  and
therefore the same degree of independence and authority should be vested  in
this person.

Currently the position is, however, that there can be more than  one  Deputy
Public Protector who have to be appointed by the cabinet member  responsible
for  the  administration  of  justice.  Now  the  amendment  of  this   Bill
recommends that there should only be one Deputy Public Protector who has  to
be appointed by the President, as in the case of the Public Protector,  with
the involvement of the department.]

The portfolio committee has added two further possible qualifications for  a
person to be appointed as  Public  Protector  or  Deputy  Public  Protector:
firstly, a person who is qualified to be  admitted  as  an  advocate  or  an
attorney and has, for a cumulative period of at least 10 years after  having
so qualified, lectured in law at  a  university  or  has  for  a  cumulative
period of at least 10 years been a member of Parliament. The other  possible
qualifications are that the person be either a judge or  a  person  admitted
as an advocate or an attorney and has for a cumulative period  of  at  least
10 years, after having been so admitted, practised  as  an  advocate  or  an
attorney or has specialised knowledge of  or  experience  for  a  cumulative
period of at least  10  years  in  the  administration  of  justice,  public
administration or public finance.

It does not seem logical that a person has to fall  in  either  one  of  the
categories mentioned to qualify to be appointed as  a  Public  Protector  or
Deputy Public Protector. When I pointed this out and  suggested  a  possible
solution, the committee, of course, under  the  capable  leadership  of  our
chairperson  and  with  the  able  assistance  of  Adv  Johan   Labuschagne,
immediately accepted this further amendment which we now  propose  that  the
other House also  accepts,  namely  that  a  person  who  has  acquired  any
combination of  experience  mentioned  in  the  other  subparagraphs  for  a
cumulative period of at least 10 years also qualifies.

I believe that this amendment also largely  accommodates  the  objection  to
the period of 10 years in respect of members of Parliament, in that our  new
democratic Parliament will only be in existence for 10  years  during  April
next year. Although this leaves us with only a few months, it  is  important
that no member of Parliament who has been a  member  since  1994  should  be
disqualified from being appointed as a Public  Protector  or  Deputy  Public
Protector on the grounds that he or she has as yet not served  as  such  for
the full period of 10 years. If, Mr Minister, there is  any  possibility  of
this happening, a proviso should be included to cater for this.

As you have heard, not all of us agreed as far as the position of  a  member
of  Parliament  is  concerned  and  that  that  should   be   one   of   the
qualifications. However, it is my  submission  that  members  of  Parliament
should at least, during a period of 10 years as members of Parliament,  have
gained  enough  knowledge  and  experience  about  the   workings   of   our
constitutional   democracy,   our   whole    government    system,    public
administration, etc, to at least put him or her on a par with  somebody  who
has  specialised  knowledge  or   experience   of,   for   example,   public
administration, as stated in subparagraph 3(d) of clause 2 and  subparagraph
4(c) of clause 4 where there is no requirement of any  legal  qualification,
but only  experience  in,  for  instance,  public  administration  for  that
period.

If, of course, a member of Parliament does not  fulfil  these  requirements,
he or she will not in any event be nominated for such an appointment by  the
National Assembly. The added  advantage,  of  course,  is  that  members  of
Parliament are well-known to each other. We know who among  us  are  capable
of fulfilling the qualities that make one eligible  to  be  appointed  as  a
Public Protector or a Deputy Public Protector, whereas other people may  not
be that well-known. I cannot see a position, as  the  Minister  has  pointed
out, where 60% of the National Assembly could vote for a  person  whom  they
have known for such a long period if that person would not  be  able  to  be
independent and act in the best interest of this country  in  that  position
... [Time expired.]

The MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam  Deputy
Chair, I am rising really to thank the hon members for what  I  think  is  a
very good and positive debate on this. I have no doubt that, to  the  extent
that the Matthee-proposed amendment would help, none of us  would  have  any
objection to it. Of course, the implication of accepting that would be  that
the Bill then has to go back to the National Assembly in order  to  be  able
to put that in, and he might not want to start an unneccesary  debate  there
over the amendment. However, if it becomes  unavoidable  and  the  amendment
has to be effected, I do not think that anybody would fight it. It would  be
objectionable to do so.

I am particularly grateful to Adv Lever for declaring the  DA's  support  of
the amendment. I must say, however, I do not share this  fear  with  anybody
who has it, because as has been said, it is  unimaginable  that  members  of
the public could trust us so much that they actually elect us  to  come  and
make the sorts of decisions and laws that we make in this  institution,  and
yet not trust us enough to be able to excercise the functions of the  office
of Deputy Public Protector.

I know a whole lot of us are wont to  suggesting  that  our  own  fears  are
fears of the public and that our own ideas are ideas of the  public  because
- I do not know how this happens: but maybe it is  part  of  those  terrible
elements in human nature - there is a tendency to think that the public  and
I are synonymous or interchangeable concepts. So, if I have a  fear  that  I
may not trust anyone who has spent 10  years  here,  I  then  say  that  the
public out there shares this fear. You would be surprised to know that  they
do not. They will trust our judgment. Once 60% of us say  X  or  Y  is  fit,
proper and suitable for this position, they will accept our judgment.  After
all, we were elected to make all manner of judgments and we  make  them.  We
have made so many of them in the past nine and a half years  already.  Thank
you, Madam Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

         JUDICIAL OFFICERS (AMENDMENT OF CONDITIONS OF SERVICE) BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam  Chairperson,
the Judicial Officers (Amendment of Conditions of Service) Bill amends  five
Acts in all. These Acts deal primarily with the appointment  of  magistrates
and conditions of  service  for  judicial  officers,  that  is,  judges  and
magistrates.

The main objectives of the Bill are the  following.  Firstly,  provision  is
made for new appointment mechanisms  in  respect  of  acting  and  temporary
magistrates; secondly, a new mechanism is created for the  determination  of
judicial officers' remuneration; thirdly, the  provisions  relating  to  the
suspension  of  magistrates  pending  investigation  by   the   Magistrate's
Commission into allegations of  improper  conduct  are  revised,  so  as  to
ensure maximum procedural fairness in such cases; and  fourthly,  provisions
pertaining to benefits accruing to spouses of judicial officers are  brought
into line with the decision of the Constitutional Court.

Regarding the new mechanism for  the  determination  of  judicial  officers'
remuneration, the Bill makes provision for this  to  be  determined  by  the
President and approved by Parliament. However, the President must make  this
determination  after  taking  into  consideration  recommendations  of   the
Independent Commission for the Remuneration of  Public  Office-bearers.  Hon
members  will  be  aware  of  the  fact  that  this  commission  also  makes
recommendations to the President regarding the remuneration of, inter  alia,
members of Cabinet, members of the  national  and  provincial  legislatures,
municipal councils and traditional leaders.

Judicial officers are indeed in a unique  position  when  it  comes  to  the
determination of their salaries and other benefits as it  would  be  clearly
inappropriate for them to engage in negotiating and bargaining processes  in
this regard.  Reflecting  on  this,  the  Constitutional  Court  stated  the
following, in paragraph 139 of the Van Rooyen judgment, and I quote:


  Judicial officers ought not to be put in a position of having  to  engage
  in negotiations with the executive over their salaries. They are judicial
  officers, not employees, and cannot and should not resort  to  industrial
  action to advance their interest in their  conditions  of  service.  That
  makes them vulnerable to having less attention paid to  their  legitimate
  concerns in relation to such matters than others who  can  advance  their
  interests through normal bargaining processes open to them.

However, the Court  also  took  notice  of  the  intention  to  involve  the
Independent Commission for the  Remuneration  of  Public  Office-bearers  in
this matter, as proposed in the original Judicial Officers  Amendment  Bill,
and expressed itself as follows, in paragraph 146 of  the  judgment,  and  I
quote:


  Unlike the magistrates, there is no filter between  the  judges  and  the
  executive to mediate the determination of their remuneration. Recognising
  this, the Minister has  submitted  a  Bill  to  Parliament  to  vest  the
  Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office-bearers with
  the power also to make recommendations on  the  salaries  of  judges  and
  magistrates.  This  is  part  of  the  evolving   process   of   judicial
  independence in South Africa.

I cannot improve on this  perspective  given  by  the  Constitutional  Court
other than to confirm this intention and to assure this House that  we  will
do our best to ensure that this mechanism will address the concerns  of  the
judiciary in a satisfactory  manner.  Also,  in  the  Van  Rooyen  case  the
Constitutional Court held that section 9(4) of the Magistrates'  Courts  Act
of  1944  which  relates  to  the  appointment  of  acting  magistrates   is
unconstitutional. Clause 1 of the Bill substitutes the  relevant  provisions
of that Act in  order  to  put  the  appointment  of  acting  and  temporary
magistrates on a sound footing.

The suspension from office of a judicial  officer  is  clearly  a  sensitive
matter that needs to be  approached  with  circumspection.  Magistrates  may
only be removed from office on  the  recommendation  of  Parliament  upon  a
finding by the Magistrates Commission that the magistrate is unfit  to  hold
such office. However, in terms of section  13  of  the  Magistrates  Act  of
1993, the commission  may  provisionally  suspend  such  a  magistrate  from
office, pending an inquiry by the commission into  his  or  her  fitness  to
hold such office. In terms of the existing provision, Parliament  will  only
be informed of such suspension when and if the commission recommends that  a
magistrate must be removed from office.
However, the Bill amends section 13 in  order  to  provide  that  Parliament
must also, in the case of a provisional  suspension,  be  informed  of  such
suspension within  seven  days  and  must,  as  soon  as  possible,  pass  a
resolution as to whether or not the  provisional  suspension  is  confirmed.
The same procedure applies in regard to any decision by  the  commission  to
reduce or to withhold a magistrate's remuneration for the duration  of  such
suspension. Parliament may at any  stage,  pending  the  completion  of  the
inquiry  into  a  magistrate's  fitness  to  hold  office,  set  aside   the
suspension of that magistrate.

The second Constitutional Court case that is relevant to  the  Bill  is  the
Satchwell case, where the court held that the failure of certain  provisions
of the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of  Employment  Act  of  2001  to
afford the same rights to same-sex life partners of judges as those  enjoyed
by spouses of married judges, is unconstitutional.

The Bill, therefore, amends the said Act in order to make provision for  the
process in terms whereof an unmarried judge may register not more  than  one
partner with the Director-General of Justice and Constitutional  Development
as his or her permanent life partner. The Bill  follows  the  criteria  laid
down by the Constitutional Court in this regard in that the  judge  must  be
involved in  a  permanent  life  partnership  in  which  both  parties  have
undertaken reciprocal duties of support. Provision  is  also  made  for  the
deregistration of such a  partner,  as  well  as  for  the  registration  of
heterosexual life partners.

The Bill carries this principle  forward  in  respect  of  the  lower  court
judiciary through the insertion of a clause of general  application  in  the
Magistrates Act of  1993.  In  terms  of  this  clause,  a  magistrate  may,
likewise, register a  life  partner  who  is,  for  all  relevant  purposes,
regarded as a lawfully wedded spouse of that magistrate.

During the consideration of the Bill by the  Select  Committee  on  Security
and Constitutional Affairs, it came to light that certain amounts  that  the
Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  may  determine  by
regulation pertaining to travel expenses, maintenance of their practices  by
advocates  acting  as  judges  and  the  like,  are  not  matters  that  the
Independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office-bearers  should
be burdened with.

On the other hand, the so-called settlement allowance payable to  judges  of
the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of  Appeal,  which  presently
also falls under the regulatory powers of the Minister, should in future  be
dealt with by the aforesaid commission.

The select committee has taken cognisance of these issues and are  proposing
certain amendments that, in my opinion, would  address  these  matters  much
more satisfactorily. I would like to thank the  committee,  which  is  under
the able chairmanship of Kgosi Mokoena, for their careful  consideration  of
this legislation. Thank you.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, hon Minister, as correctly, rightfully  and
warmly put by my hon Minister, the Bill that we  are  bringing  amends  some
five piece of legislation.

It is a known fact that our Constitution is regarded as one of the  best  in
the world. Unlike other countries, we respect our courts. For example,  when
our courts, especially the Constitutional Court, can show us that there  are
some pieces of legislation that are unconstitutional, we, in  this  people's
Parliament, will make  sure  that  we  immediately  amend  those  pieces  of
legislation accordingly. That is why this  all-five-in-one  Bill  is  before
the Council.

When the committee visited some magistrates'  offices,  there  was,  amongst
others, a complaint that cases drag on for  too  long.  As  you  are  aware,
there are many reasons as to why cases are not finalised as  quickly  as  is
expected. As you are aware, magistrates are also human beings. They  can  be
committed; they can be sick or ill; they can be involved in  accidents;  and
they can fail to preside over cases because of many other reasons.  That  is
why, in this Bill, it is proposed that someone can be temporarily  appointed
to stand in for that particular  magistrate  in  order  to  cater  for  such
circumstances. How this will be done will be outlined by my colleagues.

The second amendment  deals  with  remuneration  of  magistrates.  The  Bill
proposes that  the  President  approve  magistrates'  salaries  after  being
properly advised by the relevant commission. There are some processes to  be
followed on how this exercise would be carried  out.  Again,  that  will  be
dealt with by my colleagues.

The Bill, again, gives direction as to how the hon Minister can suspend  any
magistrate after being advised by the commission. Mr Maloyi and  Mr  Matthee
will tell a good story about how that will take place.

There was a serious debate about clauses 5, 15(a)  and  14  that  deal  with
equal benefits accruing to spouses and  partners  of  magistrates.  You  can
picture what is going to happen when the hon Joyce Kgoali does not  see  her
way clear. Your guess is as good as mine. Let's not state the obvious.

Per agreement, my colleagues will deal with the other issues  in  the  Bill.
However, I'm proud to inform the House that all the amendments  proposed  by
the select committee were accepted with a smile by  the  department  and  my
colleagues in the National Assembly.

This dynamic committee would be delighted if the Council  can  support  this
Bill with these proposed amendments. I know you are not going to  disappoint
us. We now rely on you to do just that. Let's support  this  Bill.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, although it may not at first  appear  so,  this
is a very important piece of legislation  as  it  further  strengthens  that
vital principle of our present constitutional democracy, namely the rule  of
law, "die oppergesag van die reg",  which  forms  the  basis  of  our  whole
constitutional dispensation and, of course,  embodies  the  independence  of
the judiciary.

A country can have very and many good laws,  but  if  it  does  not  have  a
judiciary which is willing and able to apply those laws  in  an  independent
way and without fear or favour, those laws are  not  much  more  than  nice-
sounding  rhetoric.  Our  courts  have  proved  that  they  are   fearlessly
independent but, as the saying goes, justice must  not  only  be  done,  but
must also be seen to be done, and therefore this Bill is  so  important,  in
that it gives effect to  the  Constitutional  Court  judgments  in  the  Van
Rooyen and Satchwell matters, as has already been pointed out, and  adresses
various problems.

Firstly,  regarding  the  temporary   appointments   of   magistrates,   two
situations are catered for,  namely  the  appointment  of  an  appropriately
qualified and fit and proper person to act in the place of  any  magistrate,
additional magistrate or assistant magistrate who is not  available,  or  in
any vacant office of a  magistrate,  by  the  Minister  for  Justice,  after
consultation with the  head  of  the  court  concerned,  for  a  period  not
exceeding three months at a  time.  The  Minister  must,  of  course,  cause
Parliament and the Magistrate's  Commission  to  be  informed  whenever  any
vacancy in the  office  of  the  magistrate  has  remained  unfilled  for  a
continuous period exceeding three months.

Secondly, an acting appointment of a competent person can  be  made  by  the
head of a regional division or a  person  occuppying  the  office  of  Chief
Magistrate in consultation with the Minister, or an official  designated  by
him, whenever a magistrate, additional magistrate  or  assistant  magistrate
is for any reason unavailable to carry out his or  her  functions.  In  this
instance, which can be described rather as a kind  of  emergency  situation,
where that head has to act, the appointment can only be for five days  at  a
time.

The remuneration of magistrates will henceforth, as it has been pointed  out
in terms of this Bill, be determined by the President after considering  the
recommendations of  the  Independent  Commission  for  the  Remuneration  of
Public Office-bearers. Magistrates will  in  terms  of  this  Bill  also  in
future be paid out of the National Revenue Fund.  Any  magistrate  appointed
in an acting or temporary capacity  to  any  other  judicial  office  for  a
continuous period exceeding one day, and where the remuneration attached  to
that other office  exceeds  the  remuneration  attached  ordinarily  to  the
position held by the magistrate, shall now be entitled  to  such  additional
remuneration. I can assure you, Minister, magistrates  will  be  very,  very
happy about this, because many of them have been acting and have been  doing
fantastic work in acting capacities, and in the past they have not  received
the remuneration that they should have.

It is also important now that the remuneration of magistrates shall  not  be
reduced, except by an Act of Parliament. Clause 4 of this  Bill  deals  with
the suspension of magistrates, and the administrative  justice  requirements
regarding suspension of magistrates  are  bolstered  substantially  in  this
Bill. The Minister may  only  provisionally  suspend  a  magistrate  on  the
advice of the Magistrate's  Commission  and  Parliament,  and  we  must  all
remember this. In other words, this House will henceforth also  be  directly
involved, because we will have to ultimately  decide  whether  a  magistrate
should be removed from office, or whether a suspension should  be  confirmed
or not. So Parliament will in future be directly involved, also in terms  of
this Bill.

Lastly, it  is  extremely  important  that  we  not  only  ensure  the  fair
treatment of our judicial officers, magistrates and judges when it comes  to
disciplinary matters and remuneration, but also ensure - and this is of  the
utmost importance in the times that we live in - that our judicial  officers
at all times experience a feeling of safety and security when they go  about
their most vital and important work in the interest of the whole country.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Thank you, Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues.  The  hon
Minister and the speakers prior to me have given  a  comprehensive  overview
of the contents of this Act, so it is not necessary for  me  to  repeat  the
same things to everybody and make you listen to  them.  Suffice  it  to  say
that from my party's point of view there are no policy matters or  technical
matters which we disagree  with.  We  support  the  motivation  by  the  hon
Minister, and we will support this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers, hon members,  one  of  the
major amendments in this Bill  is  the  insertion  of  section  15A  in  the
Magistrates Act of 1993, that is Act 90 of 1993, which addresses  the  issue
of equal benefits accruing to spouses  and  partners  of  magistrates.  This
amendment  recognises,  for  the  purposes  of  benefit,  a  partner  of   a
magistrate  who  is  not  legally  married,  but  involved  in  a  permanent
heterosexual or same-sex life  partnership  which  is  registered  with  the
Director-General of Justice and  Constitutional  Development  in  accordance
with the regulations made under section 16 of the Act.

A partner so registered is recognised for all relevant purposes of  the  Act
as the lawfully wedded spouse of the magistrate and  is  therefore  entitled
to benefits such  as  pensions  of  his  or  her  spouse  for  their  entire
lifetime. The recognition of such a spouse brings the  Act  into  line  with
the decision of the Constitutional Court.  We  should  also  bear  in  mind,
ladies  and  gentlemen,  the  stipulations  of   section   176(3)   of   the
Constitution, which states that the salaries,  allowances  and  benefits  of
judges cannot be reduced. So we've got to act in  that  way.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, Minister, I am very sorry that I have  to  break
this nice, cosy and warm support for your Bill, which  we  oppose.  Most  of
this Bill is very good, Minister, and I want to congratulate you so much  on
what you do.

What my party has to object to is that the  Government  consistently  drives
the values of an alternative counterfeit religion in  the  way  it  proposes
this  kind  of  legislation.  This  Bill,  as  with   previous   pieces   of
legislation, finesses in, along with the good - and most of it is very  good
- secular, humanist ideas on what, in this case, constitutes a family.

We understand this flows consequentially from what we think was  a  shameful
decision of the Constitutional Court on 17 March, which decided  that  after
the word "spouse", the following words are to be added, and I quote:  "or  a
partner in a permanent  same-sex  partnership  in  which  the  parties  have
undertaken reciprocal duties of support".

That decision, Minister, in our view, strikes at the very  heart  of  family
values in South Africa. Now we find also included  heterosexual  people  who
choose not to marry, but to live together, who in  future  will  also  enjoy
full pension rights as if they have been married.

Again, this clause is  corrosive  of  the  traditional  family  unit,  which
should be the building block of a healthy society, and  heaven  knows,  this
society, given the sexually transmitted diseases pandemic that we are  faced
with, needs a moral renewal.

How on earth will the Government implement  these  provisions?  How  do  you
deal with matters  such  as  divorce  between  partners,  for  example?  The
potential for defrauding the state is colossal, and what are the  tests  and
discretions that are going to be used and applied to prevent fraud?  How  is
the state going to defend the rights of the taxpayer and have the  financial
consequences costed?

It is our view, given our world view, that if you subvert  the  family,  you
subvert the country. If one threatens the family unit,  one  breaks  up  the
foundations upon which stable societies are built.  In  our  view,  this  is
another example of secular, humanist advance by stealth in this country.

The Government says it listens to  the  people.  I  don't  know  if  we  are
listening to the  same  people,  Minister.  I  respect  the  fact  that  the
President is, for example, now busy shortening the distance between  himself
and the people. We welcome that. However, there is also  a  cry  of  anguish
coming  from  the  people.  They  are  tired   of   gambling,   promiscuity,
pornography, crime, violence, assaults against  their  lives  and  property,
and now we also see a very finesse assault against the family.

South Africans wish, for example, to see a return to the  death  penalty  as
an option for murder. [Time expired.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Mr Chairperson, I had a  discussion  with  the  Minister  a
minute ago. The Minister said to me: "You know, Mr Maloyi,  you  have  seven
minutes and I have 10. If you want me to use my  10  minutes,  please  leave
whatever Mr Durr was saying to me." And I agreed. [Laughter.]

My speech is a bit long, Chair, I'm sorry to bore you. We stand  before  you
on behalf of the ANC, and I was told by Luthuli House to send  greetings  to
you, Chair. [Laughter.]

The ANC supports this Bill before us and, because I  have  agreed  with  the
Minister, let me allow the Minister to handle what was said by  Mr  Durr.  I
thank you, Chair. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, I'm sure  that  there  were  no
bilateral discussions between the  hon  member  and  yourself  outside  this
House.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  the
hon member is right. We had a telepathic communication. I  was  hoping  that
the hon member would respond  to  what  I  regard  as  an  extreme  form  of
fundamentalism that parades on shoes  with  very  high  stiletto  heels  and
pretends to be the voice of the people.

The people of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  empowered  us  to  draw  up
Constitution,  and  part  of  that  Constitution  is  a  very  basic  value:
equality.

You know, if you listen to all manner of religious  fundamentalists  -  some
come as Muslim  fundamentalists,  others  come,  as  is  the  case  now,  as
Christian fundamentalists - they will all, indeed, want us to  believe  that
they are the only ones who are the repository of truth.  In  fact,  this  is
very dangerous. In the past they  even  ran  all  sorts  of  programmes  and
killed people for daring to disagree with them. Their  world  view  was  the
correct one, was the God-given one and anything outside that  framework  was
unacceptable to them, and they would commit the most horrendous of  sins  in
the name of the Lord. [Interjections.]

They will tell us, when they speak from one  angle  of  their  mouth:  "Thou
shalt never kill", and yet when they decide to speak from a different  angle
of the same mouth, they will tell us: "Bring back  the  death  penalty."  We
won't do that, because we don't believe  that  it  is  appropriate  for  any
government to sink so low as  to  begin  to  match  the  criminal  with  the
criminal's violence. We won't do that, precisely because  we  believe  in  a
society founded on these basic values, including equality.

For us it doesn't matter who sleeps with whom  in  what  bedroom,  honestly,
... [Laughter.] ... and I won't even sit down and imagine whether  there  is
a man lying in bed with  another  man  right  now.  I  don't  want  to  have
anything to do with that. Whether they  are  heterosexuals,  homosexuals  or
gays, they are equal before the law of the Republic of South Africa, and  we
passed that Constitution of ours in full public view.

We told the people that, indeed, from now on  anything  that  might  in  the
past have constituted a  basis  for  unfair  discrimination  against  anyone
shall not apply, and this includes  discrimination  against  people  because
they  do  things  slightly   differently   from   the   way   we   Christian
fundamentalists think they ought to be done. It's improper in the extreme.

Do it the way you want to believe is correct in your own  bedroom,  in  your
own household. Don't bother us when we do it differently elsewhere.  We  are
entitled to our privacy under the Constitution. We are entitled, indeed,  to
be regarded and treated as equals before the law, and we  shall  not  accept
any fundamentalist dictatorship that parades the way we have experienced  it
here.

Having said all that, I commend this Bill to all the  members  and  I  thank
the members for, indeed, supporting it. It's very progressive. It is  indeed
an acknowledgement of reality, rather than pretend  that  reality  does  not
exist or seek to change it and bend it the way your fundamentalism  dictates
it ought to look. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate. I  shall  now  put
the question. The question  is  that  the  Bill,  subject  to  the  proposed
amendments, be agreed to. In accordance with Rule 63, I  shall  first  allow
political parties the opportunity to make their  declarations  of  vote,  if
they so wish.

I shall now proceed to the voting. Those in favour say "Aye".

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Those against say "No". [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think the "Ayes" have it. [Applause.]

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution (African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  members,  we  now  come  to  voting  in
respect of the First Order of the Day.

I shall now put the question. The question is that the Bill, subject to  the
proposed amendments, be agreed to. In  accordance  with  Rule  63,  I  shall
first allow political parties the opportunity to make declarations of  vote,
if they so wish. [Interjections.]

There is none. We shall now come to voting. Those in favour will say "Aye".

HON members: Aye.
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Those against ... [Interjections.]

An Hon MEMBER: No.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon member's vote will be  recorded.  The
majority of members have voted in favour of the Bill.  I  therefore  declare
the Bill, subject to  the  proposed  amendments,  agreed  to,  in  terms  of
section 75 of the South African Constitution. [Applause.]

                   NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Chairperson,  hon  members,
it is indeed a pleasure for me to  introduce  to  this  House  the  National
Small Business Amendment Bill.

Small business development is critical for the development of our  country's
economy. It is critical to improve the levels of equity in our country,  and
it is critical as a mechanism for the creation of jobs in South Africa.  The
promotion and support of the SMME sector is  a  priority  of  the  national,
provincial and local governments.

The second reading of  the  National  Small  Business  Amendment  Bill,  the
purpose of which is to amend the National Small Business  Act,  incorporates
the  necessary  adjustments  proposed  by  the  National  Assembly  and  the
National Council of Provinces. The changes to the Act  will  have  a  direct
impact on the national institutions that have been created  to  promote  and
support small businesses.

I would like to remind  the  House  of  these  changes,  which  include  the
following. The first one is the creation of a voice  for  small  businesses.
We all know that, due to the closure and liquidation of the  National  Small
Business Council, it is necessary that such a voice  be  re-established  and
that any reference to the NSBC in the Act be removed. The amendment  to  the
Act will also ensure that the mandate of Ntsika Enterprise Promotion  Agency
is  more  focused,  and  that  some  of  the  functions  provided  by   this
institution, which overlap with other  organisations,  are  removed.  Ntsika
has already embarked on a process to rectify this situation.

Other technical amendments allow for the extension of the due date  for  the
tabling of the annual small business review in Parliament,  in  addition  to
streamlining the process of appointing the directors of the board of  Ntsika
and enhancing information on the Schedule of the  Act  with  regard  to  the
definition of a small business.

These changes are necessary for us to ensure  that  a  legitimate  voice  is
created to articulate  the  needs  of  small  and  medium  enterprises.  The
purpose of this body will be to advise Government on  critical  issues  such
as the impact of current and new legislation  on  small  business,  and  the
identification of areas of market  failure  for  small  businesses  so  that
appropriate support and interventions can be made. It  will  provide  advice
on the constraints, the needs  and  communication  mechanisms  to  interface
with small businesses. Finally, it will give us methods to  monitor  support
services that are necessary to the small business sector.

By making these amendments, we will be paving the way for even more  changes
to our support  framework  by  giving  a  voice  to  the  small  and  medium
enterprises. We  will  be  provided  with  information  on  our  impact  and
performance in supporting this  sector,  and  based  on  this  feedback  the
department might be able to make changes and improvements.

In an ever-changing global economy it would be unwise for us not to  have  a
dynamic approach to small and medium enterprise  development.  We  therefore
need to keep our ear to the ground and listen to what small businesses  have
to say. Furthermore, we are committed to ensuring that, once this  amendment
Bill is passed, the establishment of this  advisory  body  will  take  place
within a reasonable time period, and that the  constitution  for  this  body
will be drafted in an open and transparent  process  of  consultation,  like
we've been doing up to now.
We will also ensure that institutions such as Ntsika are  focused  on  their
core business and that their internal structures are strong enough  so  that
they can adapt to the change in  domestic  and  international  environments.
The streamlining of Ntsika, as  proposed  in  the  National  Small  Business
Amendment Bill, should  go  a  long  way  in  helping  us  to  achieve  such
objectives.

It is also important that we recognise the  role  of  provincial  and  local
government in the SMME support  framework.  This  sector  is  a  very  large
sector, and according to our latest statistics it constitutes over  880  000
businesses in South Africa. Clearly,  it  would  be  impossible  for  a  few
national  institutions  to  support  this  sector  in  isolation  from   the
provincial  departments  of  economic   affairs,   local   government   SMME
development units that have been established across the country,  and  other
private sector and NGOs that have been set up to support  small  and  medium
enterprises.

Strategic partnerships  in  the  delivery  of  SMME  support  services  are,
therefore, key to the success of the SMME sector, and they  remain  part  of
our overall approach.

It is, however, necessary that we focus and  co-ordinate  the  provision  of
support by these institutions, so that we avoid the overlaps  that  we  have
observed, the duplication of services and sometimes competition between  the
different tiers of Government.

To conclude, I would like to report that we have  consulted  widely  on  the
proposed changes to the legislation, and we have  broad  support  for  these
amendments. The challenge for us now is to ensure that  there  is  effective
delivery of support to the small and medium enterprise sector by  all  tiers
of Government in  a  co-ordinated  and  well-structured  manner.  Given  the
importance of small business development to our  country,  it  is  necessary
that the institutions that we have  created  and  continue  to  support  are
efficient and well-run organisations, hence the necessity of the  amendments
that seek to improve the operations of these  institutions.  I  commend  the
Bill before this House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson, Deputy Minister and hon members, the  White  Paper
on Small Business Promotion and the National Small Business Act, Act 102  of
1996, provided guidelines for the promotion and regulation of SMMEs  in  the
Republic of South Africa based  on  three  elements,  namely,  provision  of
financial support, provision of  nonfinancial  support  and  creation  of  a
representative body for the SMME sector.

The  National   Small   Business   Amendment   Bill   contains   essentially
institutional  changes  that  are  aimed  at  creating  a  voice  for  small
business. The Bill seeks to align the focus of the department to  deal  with
the small business sector and aims to remove any  duplication  of  functions
between the department and Ntsika.

The main reason  behind  the  enactment  of  this  Bill  is  to  repeal  all
provisions pertaining to the  National  Small  Business  Council  which  was
abandoned way back in 1998; to provide ministerial  powers  to  establish  a
new body  or  a  new  voice  for  small  business  and  to  amend  technical
provisions relating to the agencies by narrowing down the broad  mandate  of
Ntsika; and to refocus it  by  providing  financial  support  to  all  small
businesses.

In practice Ntsika is not making any  impact  in  the  SMME  sector  as  was
envisaged. The  diversity  of  tasks  such  as  training,  research,  policy
advocacy and running of badly integrated  institutions  contributed  towards
it not realising its stated intentions. The lack of  institutional  capacity
to deliver became one of the major obstacles for Ntsika in  its  role  as  a
nonfinancial adviser in Government's small business strategy.

In order for Ntsika to be effective  it  needs  to  correctly  identify  and
positively address the regulatory framework of the financial systems  to  be
in line with the mandate of DTI, which is to keep Ntsika more  focused.  The
amendments to this Bill are aimed at changing, streamlining and  overhauling
Ntsika by taking away its policy-making  and  research  functions.  Then  it
would be more focused on its activities on small business support.

The Bill seeks to remove Ntsika's  general  and  broad  mandate  to  conduct
research and  now  aims  to  provide  a  more  focused  mandate  on  service
delivery. In addition, the Bill  also  seeks  to  make  the  Public  Finance
Management Act applicable to Ntsika as well, and to  establish  a  dedicated
institution that is directly involved with small business.

In the old Act, the National Small Business Council was tasked to  represent
and promote the interests of small business, and to advise  them  on  policy
matters at all Government levels. However, in practice,  it  was  unable  to
get sufficient buy-in to be a credible representative body  and  took  on  a
number  of  auxiliary  functions  instead  of  concentrating  on  the   main
function.

The amending Bill grants the Minister the  power  to  set  up  a  body  that
represents the interests of small business,  as  a  decision  was  taken  to
provide  a  more  flexible  formulation  in  the  National  Small   Business
Amendment Bill. Specific details that  seek  to  spell  out  every  possible
circumstance would not be beneficial.

It further tries to create a network of service  providers  to  ensure  that
the majority of the people of South Africa play a more  meaningful  role  in
the economy of the country. Market constraints and  the  inability  to  sell
their products and services are  some  of  the  major  obstacles  for  small
businesses to play a meaningful role in the economy of the country.

There was a need, therefore, to make its advocacy role  more  inclusive,  as
this function cannot be limited to merely furthering the  interests  of  its
members. Section 18 of the principal Act, dealing  with  the  implementation
of strategy, authorises its advocacy function via the Minister of Trade  and
Industry's guidelines.  We  need  to  overcome  the  problem  regarding  the
provision of smooth transition from one system to another.

The monetary provisions which are regarded as problematic for  SMMEs  should
be defined, so that they  are  not  dependant  on  monetary  exchanges.  The
framework currently used in every useful and other jurisdiction  is  defined
in terms of the number of historically  disadvantaged  people  employed.  It
has to be remembered that  this  only  serves  as  a  broad  guideline  and,
therefore, the monetary aspects are not only  focused  on  it,  but  on  the
broader factors as well.

Institutional and other problems to strengthen the capacity of  agencies  to
provide a strong business support to a small business  are  being  addressed
in the National Small Business Amendment Bill.

Lastly, the proposed Bill seeks to lay out a process  of  consultation  with
stakeholders, as well as to define the functions and powers assigned to  the
advisory board. We propose that this Bill be adopted.

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the  question.  The  question
is that the Bill be agreed to. In accordance with Rule  63,  I  shall  first
allow political parties the opportunity to make their declaration  of  vote,
if they so wish. We shall now proceed to the voting.  Those  in  favour  say
"Aye".

HON MEMBERS: Aye.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Those against say "No".

HON MEMBERS: No.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think the "Ayes" have it. The  majority  of
members have voted in favour. I therefore declare  the  Bill  agreed  to  in
terms of section 75 of the Constitution. [Applause.]

                    NATIONAL ROAD TRAFFIC AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, as you are well aware,  the  hon
Minister has requested that the debate continues as he is still  taking  his
medication. He will be here to close the debate.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, may I ask that we  proceed  with
item three, and that Mr  Mhlahlo  from  the  Eastern  Cape  start  with  the
debate. Thank you.

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern Cape): Hon Chairperson and members of this hon  House,
I wish to make a submission on behalf of the province of  the  Eastern  Cape
on this important Bill. I wish to submit immediately that we  fully  support
the amendments contained in this National Road Traffic  Act,  especially  as
it seeks to rectify the categories of persons who  were  undergoing  medical
treatment, those who were imprisoned with proof and those who  were  outside
the country at the time of the  conversion  of  drivers'  licences  in  this
country.

We believe that this is a  reasonable  consideration  on  the  part  of  the
Government in  this  country,  especially  the  Minister  of  Transport.  Of
course, we need to strengthen the capacity of  registering  authorities  and
motoring mechanisms to make sure that all the  above  categories  of  people
and communities are provided with the necessary  service.  We  also  believe
that those who decided to ignore  the  process  of  conversion  of  drivers'
licences and failed  to  meet  the  deadline  must  not  exploit  this  good
intention.

The Eastern Cape supports this Bill, and we are  fully  confident  that  the
process  of  conversion  which  was  undertaken  by  the  Minister  will  be
successful in this country. We have monitored the fact that, for  the  first
time, drivers in South Africa are beginning to be co-ordinated and  a  sense
of law is taking place across our roads. However, we do  want  to  make  the
point that we must not take this process for granted.  Government  must  pay
attention to our  infrastructure,  especially  roads,  because  it  is  only
through our road network and a strong traffic system that we'll  defend  our
democracy. This is the point where the weaknesses of  any  democracy  become
visible. We therefore support this important Bill.

Those admitted for medical reasons, for sure, as it is stated in  the  Bill,
will be taken care of. Of course, those who  were  on  foreign  missions  in
other countries will also  be  catered  for,  as  well  as  those  who  were
employed outside the country with fully  acceptable  permits,  and  students
who had academic responsibilities in foreign countries and institutions.

With those few words we wish to make the submission that as a  province,  we
support the Bill with amendments. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chair, it is an honour for me to  present  this  speech  in
this esteemed House on behalf of the hon MEC of Transport and  Public  Works
of the Free State. I'll read it to you.

There are currently about 6 million licensed drivers and about  6,7  million
registered and licensed vehicles on South  African  roads.  This  figure  is
made up of 3,8 million sedan cars,  252  000  minibuses  of  which  126  000
operate as minibus taxis, 24 000 buses, 227 000 heavy freight vehicles,  1,2
million  light  delivery  vehicles,  1,1  million  other  vehicles  such  as
trailers, motorcycles, etc.

Having these statistics for South African road users, we are  confronted  by
the following safety problems.  There  are  currently  about  512  000  road
accidents per year. Of these about 28 000  are  fatal  or  lead  to  serious
injuries. The total cost of these crashes to the South  African  economy  is
currently estimated at  about  R13,8  billion  per  year.  Where  does  this
situation put us in global terms? The statistics are sobering: The state  of
Victoria, in Australia, registers only  1,2  deaths  per  10  000  vehicles,
while China registers 26. South Africa, despite the welcome drop from  15,13
deaths per 10 000 vehicles in 1995 to 13,73 in 1998,  still  falls  well  on
the wrong side of the mainstream.

Two important  aspects  could  be  deduced  from  the  foregoing  situation.
Firstly, our record has always been  bad,  notwithstanding  the  significant
downward blips in the last years of World War 2, when we had a  severe  fuel
shortage, resulting in less domestic travelling  and  in  1974  when,  as  a
result of the global oil crisis, drastic speed  restrictions  were  enforced
on South African roads. Secondly, in recent years,  particularly  since  the
launch of the Arrive Alive campaign, we witnessed what is starting  to  look
like a significant downward trend.

Clearly the adoption of the Road to Safety  Strategy,  in  combination  with
the all-year Arrive Alive campaign, will  consolidate  and  accelerate  this
trend. It is against this background that we should  start  identifying  the
weaknesses within our legislation so as to  enhance  the  implementation  of
the Road-to-Safety  Strategy.  This  could  only  be  achieved  through  the
amendments like the one in front of us, which is aimed at,  amongst  others,
empowering the Minister to determine a date for expiry of  licences  in  the
former TBVC states and self-governing territories. This  will  indeed  go  a
long way in ensuring that all drivers on our  roads  are  in  possession  of
appropriate drivers' licences, thereby contributing to safety on our  roads.


Further, this will also be indicative of our commitment  to  the  objectives
of the Road Safety Strategy. Mr Chair, the Free State supports the Bill.

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Deputy Chair, hon special delegates and hon colleagues,  at
the outset and in anticipation of the presence of the  hon  Minister  Dullah
Omar who, I believe, will be coming to the House  a  little  later,  I  take
great pleasure in welcoming him back to our Chamber.

The National Road Traffic Amendment Bill in effect sets different  deadlines
for different classes of persons to substitute their driving licences,  that
is, it sets different dates for the expiry of certain licences and  for  the
simultaneous substitution of these driving licences with  the  new  national
ID-type licences.

Different challenges and difficulties have to be  addressed  as  they  arise
along the way. One of the main challenges was in respect of licences  issued
in the former TBVC states. Much to the dismay  of  the  department,  it  was
found that no database existed to ascertain the correct number  of  licensed
drivers. According to a briefing to the Select Committee on Public  Services
by the department, in the  Ciskei/Transkei  territories  for  example,  only
some 500 000 have been identified. A major  problem  in  provinces  such  as
Mpumalanga and Limpopo for example, was  that  a  lack  of  a  database  was
compounded by the fact that documents either went missing or were  burnt  in
domestic fire accidents.

At this moment I would like to beg your indulgence, hon Chair, to pause  and
sympathise with our  compatriots  in  Mpumalanga,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  other
places, who suffered terrible damages through the  raging  veld  fires  over
the past couple of days.

One can understand the gravity of  the  challenge  faced  by  the  Transport
Ministry. The scenario  faced  by  the  Ministry  is  no  different  from  a
situation a farmer finds himself in when his cattle go  wandering  all  over
the countryside. Therefore, one sympathises with the farmer  who  wishes  to
bring all his stray cattle into one cattle pen.

The DA also felt concerned that other categories of  motorists  who  through
the  vagaries  of  fortune,  such  as  economic  imperatives,   might   find
themselves employed outside the borders  of  the  country  and/or  are  even
students pursuing further studies abroad, might otherwise  be  found  guilty
of driving without the new ID-type licences if no accommodation is  made  to
extend the deadlines for application for the new licences.

What this Bill seeks to  do  is  to  legitimise  these  categories.  The  DA
welcomes these  changes  sought  by  the  Bill  and  has  no  hesitation  in
supporting  the  Bill.  My  party  expresses  the  hope   that   the   final
streamlining of the new driving licences will  radically  and  substantially
reduce the number of motor accidents and the resultant deaths  and  injuries
on our roads.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I  was  mandated  by  the  hon  Nyakane  to
inform you about something that he was told by his province.  This  is  what
he said I must tell you. He said that, as we are all aware, there  was  this
hullabaloo about the conversion of licences to the ID-card type  system.  We
are all aware that there were people who were trapped and could not  convert
for various reasons. Because of this, Government,  which  feels  and  thinks
for its people, deemed it fit and proper to  accommodate  people  who  could
not convert for various reasons when  the  deadline  caught  up  with  them.
These are people who were in hospitals,  or  were  part  of  the  troops  in
Burundi and other countries. They had to be covered by this amendment.

There will be a window period of six months to allow people who were not  in
the country when the deadline to convert their licences was  reached  to  do
so. Mr Nyakane said I should say the following.  As  Limpopo  we  have  this
foresight. We are progressive and considerate. Our  economy  is  growing  by
6%. In order for this economy not to go down, as  the  hon  Tolo  and  Nkuna
have confirmed, we have sent our students to go and study outside. As  I  am
speaking now, those students are still there  and  when  they  return,  they
will be skilled in order to assist the  province.  Those  who  are  licensed
would find themselves in the predicament of not being able to convert  their
licences. This amendment will also cover them. This is what we are doing  as
Limpopo.

There are people whom we have sent to do some research  on  how  to  improve
our economy in Limpopo. Those people have been there for years and they  are
also caught up in this predicament. This Bill will assist  them  to  convert
their licences when they return, to enable them to be licensed  drivers  and
do what Dr Nel said.

Other aspects of the Bill were well-covered by my colleagues.  I  wanted  to
dwell specifically on this point, which is the aim, objective and vision  of
a peace-loving and progressive Limpopo. Having said that, I  have  no  doubt
that we will all support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr  A  J  WILLIAMS  (Wes-Kaap):  Voorsitter,  die  Wysigingswetsontwerp  op
Nasionale Padverkeer van 2003 poog om sekere probleme  wat  tydens  die  pas
afgelope   proses   van   omskakeling   van   die   ou    identiteitsboekie-
bestuurderslisensie na die  kredietkaarttipe  na  vore  gekom  het,  aan  te
spreek.

Die Wes-Kaap is van mening dat die wysigings 'n stap in  die  regte  rigting
is, en dat dit die weg sal baan  vir  verdere  wysigings  wat  reeds  aandag
geniet.  Die  Wes-Kaap  steun   die   aanvaarding   van   die   wetsontwerp.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A J WILLIAMS: Chairperson, the National Road Traffic Amendment  Bill  of
2003 envisages addressing certain problems that arose  during  the  recently
completed conversion from the old identity document driver's licence to  the
credit-card type.

The Western Cape is of the view that the amendments are a step in the  right
direction, and that it would prepare the way  for  further  amendments  that
are already receiving attention. The Western Cape supports the  adoption  of
the Bill.]

The Western Cape standing committee thoroughly studied the contents  of  the
amended Bill in close consultation with MEC Essop, as well as the  head  and
officials of the Western Cape department of transport and public works.

The proposed amendments may not necessarily address all the  problems  still
in contention, encountered in the Western Cape. Having had the privilege  to
study the  comments  that  were  tabled  during  the  initial  consideration
stages, I believe that the amending Bill does address  certain  issues  that
must be attended to.

Daar is ook 'n paar praktiese gevalle van voortdurende swak  gesondheid  wat
ook in die toekoms aandag moet geniet. Die huidige wetsontwerp maak  wel  in
artikel 18(6) voorsiening vir persone wat deur 'n hof  in  staatsinstellings
geplaas is, en mense wat tot mediese instellings toegelaat  is.  Op  sigself
is dit 'n baie goeie en aanvaarbare  wysiging  tot  die  bestaande  wet,  en
daarom steun ons dit.

Hopelik, met die volgende wetswysiging  sal  ander  aanvaarbare,  uitgerekte
siektetoestande, wat nie  noodwendig  hospitalisasie  verg  nie,  egter  ook
aanvaarbare gronde vir vrystelling wees. Ek sien baie daarna uit,  aangesien
ek persoonlik daarvan bewus is  dat  swak  sig  en  ellelange  waglyste  vir
oogoperasies in beide staats- en privaathospitale baie persone  die  voorreg
ontneem het om tydens die omskakelingstydperk hul  wetlike  verpligtinge  na
te kom. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There are also practical cases of continued ill health  that  must  receive
attention in the future. The present Bill, in section 18(6), does  in  fact,
provide for persons who were placed in state institutions by  a  court,  and
for persons admitted to medical institutions. This in itself is a very  good
and acceptable amendment to  the  existing  Act,  and  for  that  reason  we
support it.

However, it is hoped that with  the  next  amendment  there  will  be  other
acceptable, long drawn-out conditions of ill health that do not  necessarily
require  hospitalisation  that  would  also  be   acceptable   grounds   for
exemption. I am looking forward to it very much as  I  personally  am  aware
that poor eyesight and very long waiting lists for eye  operations  in  both
state and private institutions deprived many persons  of  the  privilege  to
meet their legal obligations during the conversion period.]

The huge shortcoming that must still be addressed in future is the  question
of affordability. This is an immense problem as  a  result  of  poverty  and
unemployment. This should,  however,  not  delay  the  addressing  of  other
problems that may be attended to when  the  amending  Bill  is  accepted  as
drafted.

The  national  Department  of  Transport  and  all  other  nine   provincial
counterparts should really pull out all the stops to  properly  address  the
issue, and should put legislation in place to meet the needs of the  poorest
of the poor in our country.
Hoewel die wysigingswetsontwerp, soos dit op die oomblik daar  uitsien,  nie
in alle opsigte aan provinsiale verwagtinge voldoen  nie,  behoort  dit  nie
verder vertraag te word nie. Die Wes-Kaap sien uit  na  die  goedkeuring  en
ondertekening van hierdie wet deur die  President  van  die  Republiek.  Ons
sien ook uit na die volgende sarsie wysigings om  ander  aangeleenthede  aan
te spreek.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Although the amending Bill, as it stands at present,  does  not  comply  in
every respect with provincial expectations, it should  not  be  delayed  any
longer.  The  Western  Cape  is  looking  forward  to   the   approval   and
ratification of this Act by the President  of  the  Republic.  We  are  also
looking forward to the next set of amendments to address  other  matters.  I
thank you. [Applause.]]

Nksz  P  C  P  MAJODINA:  Sihlalo,  bendiye  kwagqira  ngokukhawuleza,  kuba
bendikhe ndafumana ingozi yemoto. Ndicela uxolo  ngako  oko.  Asikuko  ukuba
ndiyidelile le Ndlu.

Sihlalo namalungu ahloniphekileyo eBhunga leSizwe lamaPhondo,  mandibubulele
ubukho  bukaMphathiswa,  ngakumbi  emva  kokuhlutshwa  kwakhe  yimpilo.   Lo
Mthetho  oYilwayo  oFakela  iZilungiso  uza  kuncedisa  wonke  ummi  welizwe
lakowethu owaye washiywa ngaphandle  ngexa  wawupapashwa  ngonyaka  ka-1996.
Kuselungelweni ke ukwenza inyoba  yokuba  uMphathiswa  anikwe  amandla  athe
xhaxha  okujongana  nezi  meko  sele  ezikhankanyile  ngokubhekisele   kwabo
bakwiinkonzo zoluleko, abasezibhedlele  nakwabo  bakumazwe  ngamazwe  ngenxa
yemisebenzi, khon' ukuze banikwe ithuba nabo xa bebuyela emakhaya.

Ke, ikomiti  yale  Ndlu  ejongene  nezothutho  ivume  ngazwinye  okokuba  lo
Mthetho oYilwayo oFakela iZilungiso  uchaphazela  onke  amaphondo,  ngakumbi
lawo  ayesakuba  ngoozimele  geqe,  phofu  ke  ajika  aba  ngoozifele  geqe,
bethunana.

Mandiwudlulise   umbulelo   kubaqhubi   boMzantsi    Afrika    ngokuguqulela
iilayisenisi zabo njengoko umthetho usitsho.

Mandilumkise  le  mibutho  iphikisayo  okokuba  le  nto  yokusoloko  ingxola
ngamanani isithi abantu  abaziguqulanga  iilayisenisi  ayina  bunyani,  kuba
abanye  babantu   abangaqulanga   ngabo   bangasenalo   ilungelo   lokuqhuba
ngokwasempilweni, abanye besenziwa  bubudala,  kanti  abanye  bakula  maziko
akhankanyiweyo. Yiyo loo nto ke sisenza le  nyhweba  yalo  Mthetho  oYilwayo
oFakela iZilungiso.

Hleze kuthi kanti  abanye  bazifumana  ngondlela-mnyama  iilayisenisi,  babe
bayoyika ke ukuza kuguqula into  eyeza  ngondlela-mnyama.  Nawe  ke  Mzantsi
Afrika,  ngenxa  yale   layisenisi   ehamba   ingene   kuwo   onke   amazwe,
ubungemncinane ukuba ungangabalwa kumazwe ngamazwe.

Siyakhumbula okokuba siye  solula  umhla  kwabo  bantu  babefumana  iingxaki

Nciba, iBophuthatswana, kwaVenda, kwaNgwane, eQwaqwa nakwaNdebele.  Ewe,  lo
Mthetho oYilwayo oFakela iZilungiso uzama  ukulungiselela  loo  mazwana  aye
ngamazwe phakathi kwelizwe,  phofu  ke  kungengakuthanda  kwawo.  Yiloo  nto
sisithi ke siyawuxhasa ngokuzelyo lo Mthetho  oYilwayo  oFakela  iZilungiso.
Ndiyabulela,  Sihlalo.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of   isiXhosa   speech

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Chair,  I  quickly  went  to  a  doctor  because  I  was
involved in a car accident. My apologies. It is not that I treat this  House
with contempt.

Mr Chairperson and the hon members of the NCOP, let me  thank  the  Minister
for his presence, especially after being plagued by illness.  This  amending
Bill will assist all the citizens of this country who did not  benefit  when
the National Road Traffic Act was passed in 1996.  It  is  appropriate  that
the Minister should be provided with additional powers so as to  enable  him
to deal with the situations he has already described in  relation  to  those
who are in correctional institutions, hospitals and all over the world as  a
result of their employment, so that they are also given a chance  when  they
return.

The Select Committee on Transport therefore  unanimously  agreed  that  this
amending Bill affects all provinces, especially the former  Bantustans,  now
defunct.

Let me thank all the drivers of South Africa for converting their  licences,
as required by law.

Let me put it to the opposition parties  that  their  constant  noise  about
statistics, saying that many people have not converted  their  licences,  is
misleading, because some of the people who have  not  converted  theirs  are
those who have been disqualified from driving owing to ill  health  and  old
age, whereas others are in the institutions mentioned. That is  why  we  are
providing for a window period, through this amending Bill.

Maybe some people obtained their licences by corrupt  means,  and  for  that
reason are afraid to come forward and convert their licences.  South  Africa
has proved its international worth because this licence is valid in all  the
countries of the world.
We  will  remember  that  we  extended  the  window  period  for  those  who
experienced problems with the Department of Home Affairs, especially in  the
former Bantustans mentioned earlier.  These  are  areas  such  as  Transkei,
Ciskei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, kwaNgwane, Qwaqwa and kwaNdebele.  Yes,  this
amending Bill caters for those  areas  that  were  states  within  a  state,
although this was not of their own making. That is  why  we  are  saying  we
fully support this amending Bill. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mr E M SOGONI (Gauteng): Hon Chair, hon  Minister  and  the  House,  Gauteng
would like to welcome the  Minister  back  at  work  and  wish  him  a  full
recovery after his ill health.

The death of over 9 000 people per year in South  Africa,  as  a  result  of
road crashes, is a national  tragedy.  Although  the  various  Arrive  Alive
campaigns have started to address this issue, I think  it  will  be  prudent
for us to pause for a while and look at the causes of these  crashes.  There
are only four factors  that  can  individually  or  collectively  contribute
towards crashes: the behaviour between the driver and  the  pedestrian;  the
vehicle itself; the road design or condition; and the time of day or  night,
or weather conditions.

Research on the causes of crashes has shown that the human  element  is  the
deciding factor in more than 80% of all the road crashes.  It  goes  without
saying that, if we are serious about reducing the carnage on our  roads,  we
have to address the factor that is responsible for  more  than  80%  of  all
crashes.

We are conscious of the fact that the Department of Transport has  initiated
quite a few changes in the national legislation. In the past, you  did  your
learners' licence and then your drivers' licence and,  if  you  passed,  you
received a lifelong  drivers'  license.  The  process  itself  was  open  to
manipulation, and fraudulent drivers' licences  became  part  of  our  daily
lives. To address both these issues, it was decided to introduce the  credit
card-type licence. This would be very difficult to  forge  and  would  allow
for a five-year validity period of a  licence.  This  opened  the  door  for
retesting every five years. Currently, we are only  retesting  eyesight  for
the first renewal after five  years  but,  in  future,  this  could  include
retesting on the K53 test track.

The process entails converting the ID book-based  drivers'  licence  to  the
credit card-type license. A period of five years was initially  allowed  for
this conversion and was subsequently extended by six  months  and,  finally,
by another two months.

Whatever the debate here, today must be seen within  the  context  that  the
Government decided to go for the credit card-type licence in order  to  save
lives. The amending Bill seeks to amend the principal  Act  with  regard  to
valid licences of certain individuals that were contained  in  the  identity
documents or other documents and which have, for various reasons,  not  been
converted yet.

The Bill describes individuals who have a deserving case to  allow  them  to
apply without penalties to have  their  ID-based  drivers'  licences  deemed
valid, and allow them more time to convert  their  ID-based  licences  to  a
credit card-type licence.

However, there are areas of concern. Firstly, the amending Bill does not  go
far enough in recognising other deserving cases and, if new  deserving  case
are to be identified in future, it could lead  to  a  number  of  amendments
being tabled in Parliament. Secondly, it might  make  law  enforcement  very
difficult if, when enforcing  the  carrying  of  credit  card-type  drivers'
licences while driving is done, a whole list of exemptions have to be  noted
and taken into consideration by the law-enforcement  officers.  Thirdly,  if
the period of exemption drags on for too long, the whole focus  of  reducing
the carnage on our roads could be lost.

At some stage, we, as the representatives of the public, must say that if  a
person has been out of the transport scene, in other  words,  has  not  been
driving in South Africa for an extended period, it would  be  advisable  and
safer to have that person retested before he or she is issued with a  credit
card-type licence. In order to avoid a situation  where  every  time  a  new
deserving case is identified a new amendment Bill has to be passed,  Gauteng
would, therefore, recommend the following: that perhaps in  subsection  6(b)
we create subsection (iv) which will state  that,  ``people  prevented  from
applying by any such other circumstances or factors as may be determined  by
the Minister, in consultation with the MECs in  the  provinces  tasked  with
road traffic and the Minister of Home Affairs, by  notice  in  the  Gazette,
either  generally  or  subject  to  such  conditions  as  the  Minister,  in
consultation, may deem fit''.

In conclusion, Gauteng supports the National Road Traffic Amendment Bill  of
2003  and  recommends  the  suggested  amendment  of  subsection  6(b),   as
described. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, I must  indicate  that  I
had thought Sogoni comes from the Eastern Cape. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Hon Chair, permanent  delegates,  delegates  from
provinces, hon members and friends, allow me to say that this  is  my  first
opportunity to address this hon House since my illness. I want to thank  the
Chairperson next to me here, other presiding officers and  all  members  for
the many messages of support and for your prayers.

I am still receiving treatment, but  as  you  can  see,  medical  treatment,
support, prayers, family and community  solidarity  have  all  played  their
role to lift me in a way which makes it possible  for  me  to  be  with  you
again.

I apologise for arriving in the middle of the debate.  To  try  to  lead  as
normal a life  as  possible,  I  attended  the  NCOP  earlier  to  answer  a
question, after which I rushed to hospital to receive treatment. I  received
radio therapy and then I rushed back here for this debate.  I  did  not  ...
[Applause.] I insisted that my driver observe the speed limit. [Laughter.]

The subject matter today is the National Road  Traffic  Amendment  Bill.  We
have, over the past five years, been involved in a minor revolution -  if  I
could put it that way - in respect  of  an  important  aspect  of  the  Road
Traffic Management System, namely  the  issue  of  driving  licences.  I  am
referring to the process of  conversion  of  licences  into  the  prescribed
credit card format, CCF, driver's licences. That process  has  been  largely
successful.

Looking back over these five years,  more  than  4,5  million  drivers  have
converted their licences in terms of the law. In the same period  about  two
million new licences, also in the credit card format, have been issued.  So,
today we have approximately 6,5 million drivers on  our  roads  with  credit
card format licences.

It will be recalled that on 30 April 2003,  driving  licences  contained  in
identity documents ceased to be valid driving licences. At the time  of  the
deadline it was believed that about 800 000 people had not converted to  the
CCF. That was an estimate. We did not have accurate figures.

The implication of the deadline, which was 30 April 2003,  is  that  driving
licences contained in identity documents are since  1  May  2003  no  longer
deemed to be valid  driving  licences.  Those  with  licences  contained  in
identity documents, but who  failed  to  convert,  no  longer  have  driving
licences. To obtain licences now, they will have to go  through  the  entire
process from application for a learner's licence to the actual  K53  driving
test. For the sake of clarity, I want to make it clear  that  that  deadline
is final and it is not going to change.

It will also be  recalled  that  Notice  No  633  of  27  February  2003  in
Government Gazette 24997 granted special exemptions  to  certain  categories
of persons who could not apply during 1 March  1998  to  30  April  2003  to
convert their licences contained in identity documents to CCF licences.

There are still problems. We are dealing with real and  legitimate  problems
encountered during the conversion period.  Section  18(6)  of  the  National
Road Traffic Act, Act 93 of 1996, as amended by section 12 of  the  National
Road Traffic Amendment Act, Act 21  of  1999,  authorises  the  Minister  to
determine a date on which  a  driving  licence  contained  in  the  identity
document will cease to  be  a  valid  driving  licence.  However,  the  said
provision does not empower the Minister to  extend  the  period  determined,
neither does the provision allow the Minister to make exemptions.  The  Bill
before the House seeks to deal with these problems.

Clause 1(a) of the Bill caters for several categories of  persons  who  were
unable  to  convert  the  driving  licences  contained  in  their   identity
documents to the prescribed driving licence  format  within  the  prescribed
time period. These categories are, firstly, those admitted  to  any  medical
facility or detained in any state institution in terms of an order of  court
or a sentence imposed by an  order  of  court;  secondly,  those  posted  by
Government on a foreign mission or assignment; thirdly, those on a  contract
of employment outside the borders of the Republic and,  fourthly,  full-time
students at foreign academic institutions.

Clause 1(a) of the Bill provides for  a  window  period  to  enable  persons
falling into these categories to  convert  their  driving  licences  to  the
credit card-format driving licences, so  that  in  the  window  period  they
would be free from prosecution for  not  being  in  possession  of  a  valid
driving licence in the prescribed  format.  The  expectation  is  that  such
persons will use the window period to obtain the CCF driver's licences.

Clause 1(b) amends the Act, firstly, to provide for  the  date  after  which
driving licences contained in identity documents and those that are  not  so
contained will be deemed not to be driving licences in  terms  of  the  Act;
secondly, to empower the Minister to set different dates for compliance  for
persons falling within different  categories  to  substitute  their  driving
licences; and, thirdly, to empower the Minister to set different  dates  for
persons holding different types of  driving  licences  to  substitute  their
driving licences.

The  national  and   provincial   departments   of   transport,   in   their
communication strategies, have been  encouraging  persons  holding  licences
from former TBVC states and  self-governing  territories  to  convert  their
licences to credit card format driving licences  before  1  September  2003,
which has just gone by. All persons affected are very much aware  of  the  1
September 2003 time frame, and should be prepared for  the  Bill  now  under
discusion.

Should the House approve this Bill, the Minister will be in  a  position  to
promulgate the date on which the TBVC  state  and  self-governing  territory
licences will cease to be valid licences. This will bring this  category  of
persons in line with those  who  formerly  had  driving  licences  in  their
identity documents.

Clause 2 of the Bill caters for persons who acquired their driving  licences
from the former TBVC states and self-governing  territories  and  could  not
convert, because their records were available only at one of the offices  in
these territories or because those  offices  no  longer  exist.  This  is  a
particularly difficult problem to resolve. For  example,  it  is  also  said
that in at least one case  the  office  burnt  down  and  the  records  were
destroyed during the fire. So, it is a  particularly  difficult  problem  to
resolve, but hopefully it will not affect too many people.

The Bill empowers the Minister to set different dates for  such  persons  to
convert their licences. In other words, the Bill seeks to  deal  with  those
problem areas which have been identified during the conversion  period,  and
I trust that the proposals placed before this  House  will  meet  with  your
approval.

In conclusion, both national and provincial governments will have to keep  a
close watch on this conversion and any further  problems  which  may  arise,
and we must be prepared to deal with those problems. At the  same  time,  as
was pointed by hon Sogoni, we cannot just  create  category  after  category
and clutter up our statute book with a number of categories which will  make
the law difficult to enforce. From the side of national  Government,  and  I
know from provincial governments, we are looking critically at the  process,
and where there are steps which need to be taken then, together, we will  be
prepared to take those steps. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I am  sure  that  members  will  agree
with me that the Minister's degree of commitment to his  work  is  exemplary
to all of us. [Applause.]

That concludes the debate. I shall now put the question  that  the  Bill  be
agreed  to  as  the  decision  is  made  in  terms  of  Section  65  of  the
Constitution. I shall first  ascertain  whether  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. I am told  that  they
are present.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote if they so wish. There is none. We  shall
now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall  do  this  in  alphabetic
order per province. Delegation heads must please indicate to  the  Chair  as
to whether they are voting in favour or  against  or  abstain  from  voting.
Free State? I am sorry, Eastern Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Enkosi  sihlalo,  siyayi  xhasa.  [Thanks,  Chairperson,  we
support it.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

Dr P J C NEL: Vrystaat ondersteun. [Free State supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Gauteng supports.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Supports.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Limpopo?

Mr M I MAKOELA: I khou tendelana. [It supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?

Ms M P THEMBA: Mpumalanga iyawusekela. [Mpumalanga supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Cape?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Northern Cape iyavuma. [Nothern Cape supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?

Mr Z S KOLWENI: North West ke ya rona. [North West supports.] [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Mr C  ACKERMANN:  Die  Wes-Kaap  steun  die  wetgewing.  [The  Western  Cape
supports the legislation.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: All nine provinces voted in favour.  I
therefore declare the  Bill  agreed  to  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution. [Applause.]

                         MR M A SULLIMAN'S STATEMENT

                                  (Ruling)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, if you  could  allow  me,
before we conclude the business  of  the  day,  to  make  a  ruling  on  the
statement, as hon members will recall, by hon  Sulliman.  I  would  like  to
make a ruling on the objection that was  raised  by  the  hon  member  Lever
against the statement which was made by the hon Sulliman in our  plenary  on
Thursday last week.

At that time I ruled that the objection by the hon Lever was not a point  of
order. However, after perusal of  the  Hansard  record,  I  noted  that  the
allegations were of a  serious  nature.  As  members  we  cannot  make  such
allegations against each other without a  substantive  motion  alleging  the
facts which, if found to be true, would require that the  House  establishes
a committee to look into the matter and pronounce itself accordingly.

I, therefore, rule that the statement made by the hon Sulliman  was  not  in
keeping with the decorum of the House. I  would  ask  the  hon  Sulliman  to
withdraw the statement.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: I withdraw, Deputy Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I thank you.

The Council adjourned at 17:26.
