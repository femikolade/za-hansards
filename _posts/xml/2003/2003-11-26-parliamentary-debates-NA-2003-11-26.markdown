                ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, we now come to the  election  of  the  Pan-
African  parliamentarians.  I  wish   to   remind   hon   members   of   the
recommendation contained in the Eighth Report of the Working  Group  on  the
African Union, which was considered by  the  House  on  25  September  2003,
that, of the five members that are to  be  elected  to  serve  on  the  Pan-
African Parliament, at least three should be women. We  don't  mind  if  all
five are women, but at least three should be.

I have received the following nominations: From the ANC we  have  the  names
of Dr Frene Ginwala, Mr M J Mahlangu of the NCOP and Mrs M A A  Njobe;  from
the DA we have received the nomination of Mr C W  Eglin;  from  the  IFP  we
have received the name of Prof H Ngubane; from the New NP, we have  received
the name of Dr B L Geldenhuys. I just received a note withdrawing  the  name
of a nominee from the ACDP. Are there any further  nominations?  No  further
nominations. I will now put the nomination ...

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Deputy Speaker, on a point of  order:  The
decision of Parliament was that three  of  the  representatives  would  come
from the majority party and two would represent the opposition parties.  May
I ask whether you are going to let the governing party elect its  three  and
then let the opposition elect its  two.  [Interjections.]  Because,  if  one
does not do that, it means that  the  Government  is  going  to  choose  the
opposition representatives.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, I am just about to come to the procedure  of
how this House is going to elect the five parliamentarians.  What  is  going
to happen is that this afternoon the other House will also  elect  the  five
parliamentarians. That's how we are going to do it.

We had asked the opposition parties to please make things easier for  us  by
coming together and submitting to us two names. However, we  have  had  more
than two nominations from the opposition parties and, therefore, this  House
is now going to elect the five representatives.

I will now put the nominations in the following order:  ANC,  DA,  IFP,  New
NP; and, of  course,  we  cancelled  the  ACDP,  who  have  withdrawn  their
nominee. Members should vote for each candidate when the name is put. So  we
are going to vote for each of the names. The  candidates  with  the  largest
number of votes, within the  prescription  that  at  least  three  shall  be
women, will be elected to the Pan-African Parliament. The bells will now  be
rung for three minutes.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, there's  no  point  of  order,  the  bells  are  now
ringing, hon member.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Well, I'll have to do it  when  the  bells
stop ringing.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What do you want to say?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: I want to know whether  it's  possible  to
vote ``yes'' or ``no'' for a candidate. Is that what we are doing?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: So it's possible  to  vote  ``no''  for  a
candidate?
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Good.

Question put: That Dr F N Ginwala be elected as a member of the  Pan-African
Parliament.

us. As we are here today talking about the  Pan-African  Parliament,  it  is
because, Mr President, you took a visible step.]

In presenting the Tenth Report of the Working Group on the African Union,  I
want to pause and echo the words of our  Deputy  President  in  his  opening
speech during the meeting of the African parliaments in July  this  year.  I
quote:


  The dream of a continent in harmony with the needs of its people inspired
  the formation of both the African Union and the  Pan-African  Parliament.
  One of the most  important  instruments  of  the  African  Union  is  the
  protocol on the Pan-African Parliament. The Pan-African  Parliament  will
  be a forum where the voices of African people will be heard.

The need for the establishment of a Pan-African Parliament arises  from  the
aspirations of people like Kwame Nkrumah, who understood the  importance  of
political unity under Pan-Africanism  and  worked  very  hard,  alongside  a
number of other African visionaries, in fulfilling this objective.

The Pan-African Parliament is certainly an institution  which  will  further
African unity. It is accepted that the main weakness of the  OAU  was  unity
at the top amongst heads of state and presidents. Many decisions were  taken
by the heads of state which did not filter down to individual countries  and
states.

There is a wide acceptance that the parliamentary system is  the  best  form
of  government  and  the   Pan-African   Parliament   will   encourage   the
establishment  of  democratic  parliaments  throughout  the  continent.  The
parliamentary system encourages accountability to the people and  there  are
countries  in  Africa  where  accountability  and  transparency  are   still
lacking.

The African continent is in serious socioeconomic difficulty  and  has  been
marginalised in the  global  economy.  This  creates  a  need  to  encourage
multilateralism and the  Pan-African  Parliament  could  be  the  voice  for
unifying the continent and making it a unified  continent  in  international
forums.

The vision  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  must  be  congruent  with  the
aspirations and needs of the African people, for example the improvement  of
quality of life, human dignity, human security, sustainable development  and
deriving the benefits of development.

The character of the Pan-African Parliament will be the model  of  democracy
and good governance on the African continent. It  will,  therefore,  embrace
political and social  plurality,  democracy,  representation,  transparency,
gender equality and popular participation.

In  dealing  with  the  election  of  the  delegation  to  the   Pan-African
Parliament, the protocol  states  that  representation  of  each  parliament
shall  reflect  the  diversity  of  political  opinion  in   each   national
parliament. It further states, in Article 6, that the delegates to the  Pan-
African Parliament shall vote in their personal and independent capacity.

 We hope that the delegates  will  understand  this  sentence  very  clearly
because it does not mean that they should forget that they are sent  by  the
South African Parliament, and would thus represent us. When other  delegates
in the Pan-African Parliament  look  at  them,  we  want  them  to  see  the
democratic Parliament of South Africa through these delegates.

In the working group's eighth report we recommended that three of  the  five
delegates to the Pan-African Parliament be women. This  report  was  adopted
by this House on 25 September 2003. The House has  therefore  endorsed  this
by adopting the report.

These members will represent our Parliament rather than a  particular  House
of our Parliament. The NCOP will also be represented in the  delegation,  as
we have just voted upon, with the inclusion of Mr Mahlangu. Women in  Africa
have made their mark. The South African revolution of the ANC has  been  the
major contributor to this decision.

If we pause and look back  at  the  history  of  women  in  Africa,  we  are
confident that this is indeed a big achievement. We hope that  other  states
will vote just like we did. To think that only men  were  allowed  to  stand
for elections or had a right to elect or be  elected  and  that  women  were
looked upon as minors or inferior to hold such a  position  where  important
decisions were made  for  different  states  and  continents  is  unheard-of
today.

Today as I speak and  as  we  have  elected  delegates  to  the  Pan-African
Parliament we, at the same time, applaud  the  work  and  progress  made  in
making sure that women of Africa are part of this achievement and  they  are
part of the decision-making process. They have been  emancipated  and  their
mind-sets have been changed. They participate in making the laws  that  will
govern the whole continent, side by side with men, making sure  that  gender
issues are on the African agenda.

In further emphasising the turnaround in the role of women we look  back  to
the resolutions made during the election of  the  commission,  when  it  was
resolved that half of the commissioners should be women.

Women on the continent have struggled. We  therefore  have  to  applaud  and
defend the achievements they have made so far. We all know that  it  is  not
only in South Africa that we constitute more than 5O% but, in the  whole  of
the continent, women constitute a percentage greater than 50%.

We therefore cannot allow ourselves to  live  like  we  did  yesterday  when
there is light at the end of the tunnel. It has been a  long  and  demanding
process for the working group and staff from the first to the  tenth  report
that we are debating today. We are approaching a  state  of  finalising  the
process of establishing the Pan-African Parliament.  We  are  proud  of  the
work that we have done so far, in  the  meetings,  the  workshops,  and  the
seminars that were organised in making this process successful.

The working group therefore wants  to  thank  this  House  for  successfully
electing the five members to the Pan-African Parliament  and  we  appreciate
the fact that the gender representation was so high. I want  to  say  again:
We hope that other states in Africa will  do  as  the  South  Africans  have
done, so that we can have the number of women  that  we  need  in  the  Pan-
African Parliament; not only to take care  of  gender  issues  but  also  to
participate in substantive issues.

In closing, I want to  thank  the  Presiding  Officers,  in  particular  the
Speaker, who has been the chair of the committee, and  the  Deputy  Speaker.
They were always there and guided  us  correctly  when  we  were  trying  to
finalise this process. I also want to thank the  Deputy  President  and  hon
members. [Applause.]

Mr C W  EGLIN:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  tenth  report,  which  we  are
discussing at the moment, primarily dealt with the question of the  election
of five members to represent South Africa at the Pan-African Parliament.
Well, that election has taken place, and I just want to  say  that  the  ANC
has had its way, and there you are - that's what it is - and just  to  leave
it like that. I want to say on this that we will  watch  with  interest  how
the ANC nominees perform, other than the lady on our left who was  going  to
be elected because she was the only lady on the opposition side  -  that  is
Hariett Ngubane - who was elected in her own right. [Interjections.]

Be that as it may,  those  members  are  in  for  an  interesting  time.  We
mentioned that when we discussed this the other day. This  is  the  question
of the ambiguity as to the mandate of the members who go there,  bearing  in
mind that when they go there they will be going to  an  interim  Pan-African
Parliament, to be constructed in that way for five years, and thereafter  to
be constructed in a different way.

What is interesting about the members who go there is that they are  elected
by Parliament, elected by the ANC. They  don't  represent  Parliament.  They
are, in terms of the Act or the protocol, there to  represent  the  country.
Since the countries of Africa will be represented by five  people,  we  were
merely an electoral college,  rigged  to  get  it  right  for  the  ANC;  an
electoral college and that's what we are in terms of the protocol.

Thirdly, this has to reflect the diversity of  political  opinions.  Whether
it  reflects  the  diversity  of  political  opinions   in   their   correct
proportions or in their totality is a matter for discussion and debate.  But
they reflect different political opinions,  and  clearly  the  intention  is
that those views should be expressed as different political opinions on  the
Pan-African Parliament.

Fourthly, it says that although you are elected by Parliament, although  you
represent the country and  reflect  the  diversity  of  political  opinions,
``each member shall vote in his personal  and  independent  capacity''.  So,
each member goes there as an independent and is not tied to a caucus, or  to
a party, or to a formal mandate. In terms of the protocol, each member  will
vote in line with his personal and independent capacity.
Having said that, there is another provision. This is that  members  can  be
recalled by their national parliament at any time. So you have a dilemma  of
members going there, representing not Parliament but the country, acting  in
their personal and  independent  capacity,  but,  nevertheless,  subject  to
recall by the national parliament itself.

I just raised this as a practical situation of  five  different,  call  than
``mandates'', of the people who are going to represent South Africa  at  the
Pan-African Parliament. I hope that it works. I  hope  that  South  Africans
will make a contribution, in particular to  strengthening  democracy  around
Africa. I believe that the Pan-African Parliament, provided not  only  South
African delegates, but all of the delegates, realise  that  although  it  is
only a consultative and advisory body,  there  is  power  in  the  words  of
people on a public platform and in a public forum  like  a  parliament,  can
speak out against corruption,  against  the  abuse  of  power,  against  the
violation of human rights. It will have an effect,  not  just  in  the  Pan-
African Parliament, but around Africa.
And, if they speak up for accountable  government,  if  they  speak  up  for
sound governance, if they speak up for the ordinary people - the people  who
for five years in South Africa have waited for treatment for Aids - if  they
could speak up for them by the time they go there, I believe that  this  can
make a difference to Africa.

On balance, whatever the problems are about  the  Pan-African  Parliament  -
and there will be many problems of an  administrative  and  of  a  technical
nature - I believe that, provided the members who  go  there  realise  their
responsibility and are prepared to speak up and to  speak  out  and  not  be
mere lackeys of political parties or electoral colleges, you  can  make  the
AU a more democratic institution than it is today. I  believe  that  it  can
have a ripple and a knock-on effect and that democracy will be  deepened  in
the countries right around Africa. [Applause.]

Ms M M MDLALOSE: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  first  of  all  I  would  like  to
congratulate the five members of Parliament who will be representing  us  at
the Pan-African Parliament.

Women have played the  most  important  role  in  the  emancipation  of  the
African continent from colonial rule as well as in the  overall  development
of Africa. They are the mothers of the sons  and  daughters  who  laid  down
their lives so that we, as the continent, can enjoy the fruits  of  freedom.
It is against this background that we welcome the provision of  the  African
parliaments protocol with regard to the representation of women in the  Pan-
African Parliament delegation. This is a  clear  sign  of  maturity  in  the
continent of Africa, as we are able to lay  down  gender  representation  as
the criterion in the formation of one of the most important  organs  of  the
African Union.

The ratification of the Pan-African Parliament protocol by the  majority  of
the member states is a clear sign of commitment to the unity of  Africa  and
a realisation by the people of Africa that we need to work collectively  for
the development of this continent.
The Pan-African Parliament is going to be a powerful  organ  in  reinforcing
peace  initiatives  and  other  developmental  programmes  for  the  African
continent, given the fact that a parliament is a binding institution on  its
members who are bound by common laws and principles which have  been  agreed
to by them. A defaulting member of the said parliament will have  to  answer
to the whole body politic of the Pan-African Parliament as to why they  have
defaulted on what they have ratified and agreed to in the first place.

Nepad, we believe, will reap more rewards from this institution as  it  will
institutionalise the programmes of African development  and  therefore  push
forward what the pioneers, among whom is our President, have  envisaged  for
our mother continent.

This institution should also strive to protect our indigenous knowledge  and
wealth, thus enhancing our African intellectual  capital,  which  will  also
market us as one of the great peoples amongst the people of the  world.  The
natural resources that course the belly of our continent  and  our  sea  bed
can turn Africa into an economic giant of the world, provided that there  is
co-operation amongst the peoples of Africa.

The Pan-African Parliament will lead to the promotion of democracy and  good
governance, making it a forum for the unification of  African  states.  This
will be a new model of democracy, while  promoting  the  principles  of  the
African Renaissance.

The IFP hopes that this parliament will be a unique  step  for  the  African
continent. With those words, the IFP supports the report.

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Agb Mevrou die Speaker, vandag is inderdaad 'n mylpaal  in
die politieke geskiedenis van Afrika. Ek wil  graag  my  kollegas  gelukwens
met hul verkiesing tot die eerste Pan-Afrikaanse  Parlement  en  hulle  alle
sterkte toewens vir hul termyn. Ek het volle vertroue dat hulle  Suid-Afrika
na die beste van hul vermoë op  daardie  forum  sal  dien.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Hon Madam Speaker, today is indeed  a  milestone  in  the
political  history  of  South  Africa.  I  would  like  to  congratulate  my
colleagues on their election to the first Pan-African  Parliament  and  wish
them the very best for their term of service. I have every  confidence  that
they will serve South Africa to the best of their ability in that forum.]

According to the Abuja Treaty establishing the African  Economic  Community,
which remains an important precept, such a community is  to  be  established
gradually in six stages over a transitional period not exceeding 34 years.

The first of these stages would  be  to  strengthen  the  existing  regional
economic  communities.  This  in  itself  would  present  a   challenge   of
rationalisation and co-ordination. The second stage deals, inter alia,  with
strengthening sectoral integration at regional and continental  levels.  The
fifth stage envisages the establishment of an African  common  market.  Only
in the sixth stage, concurrent with the setting up of  an  African  monetary
unit and a single African bank and currency, would the  final  stages  occur
of setting up structures of a Pan-African Parliament.

In the event, in our case, it worked out  differently.  What  seems  like  a
logical order of things is in a sense being reversed in our process.

'n Mens sou die vraag kon vra of dit nie beter sou  wees  as  hierdie  Abuja
modaliteite meer noukeurig gevolg kon word nie, maar 'n proses  het  sy  eie
logika en soos die inwerkingstelling van die bepalings van  die  Afrika-unie
se grondwet verloop het,  is  nuwe  imperatiewe  waargeneem  en  insigte  in
hierdie realiteite het ook ontwikkel. Dit het duidelik geword  dat  'n  Pan-
Afrika Parlement 'n noodsaaklike katalisator sal wees in die  bereiking  van
die doelwitte van die AU, asook van  Nepad.  Die  ongelykhede  wat  daar  in
Afrika is, word deur sy komponente en besluitnemende liggame weerspieël.

Die PAP self  sal  'n  boublok  vir  Afrika-ontwikkeling  moet  wees  en  'n
sentrale kanaal vir kommunikasie  na  die  parlemente  en  publiek  van  die
lidlande. Voorts sal die blote bestaan van hierdie liggaam  waarskynlik  die
impuls wees om meer lande met 'n groter mate van  geesdrif  vir  die  AU  te
vul. Maar belangriker nog, die PAP kan 'n betekenisvolle instrument wees  om
dieper inbinding tot die Nepad-inisiatief teweeg te bring.

Ten slotte wil die Nuwe NP graag erkenning gee aan  die  leierskap  van  die
Speaker, wat die proses met groot bekwaamheid dryf. Suid-Afrika kan met  reg
trots wees op sy eerste vroulike Speaker.

Ons steun  graag  die  aanvaarding  van  hierdie  verslag.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[One could ask if it would not be better if these Abuja modalities could  be
followed more accurately, but a process has its own logic and in the  course
of the implementation of the provisions of the constitution of  the  African
Union new imperatives were noted and  insights  into  these  realities  also
developed. It became  clear  that  a  Pan-African  Parliament  would  be  an
essential catalyst in achieving the goals of the African Union, as  well  as
those of Nepad. The inequalities in Africa are reflected by  its  components
and decision-making bodies.

The PAP itself will have to be a building block for African development  and
a central channel for communication with the parliaments and public  of  the
member countries.  Furthermore,  the  very  existence  of  this  body  would
probably be the impulse to infuse more countries  with  a  greater  deal  of
enthusiasm for the AU. But, and this is even more important, the PAP can  be
a meaningful instrument to bring about greater cohesion with regard  to  the
Nepad initiative.

In conclusion, the New NP would like to give recognition to  the  leadership
of the Speaker, who is driving the process with great ability. South  Africa
can be justifiably proud of its first female Speaker.

We have pleasure in supporting the adoption of this report.]
Adv Z L MADASA: Deputy Speaker, it is unfortunate that,  after  having  done
so much work, we are given little time to talk. Anyway,  I  would  like  to,
firstly, congratulate the delegates who have been elected. Secondly, I  wish
to acknowledge the leadership of the  Speaker  and  Deputy  Speaker  in  the
whole process. We are excited to see the fruition of the launch of  the  PAP
after such hard work. We can now see that the ideas  of  the  African  Union
are no longer just on paper but we  are  witnessing  the  fruition  and  the
coming into being of the PAP.

On behalf of the ACDP, I would like to endorse  the  report  and  thank  all
members of the committee. We wish the new delegates  to  continue  the  good
work in the future. Thank you.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Deputy Speaker and hon  members,  I  must  also  take  this
opportunity to congratulate the hon members who have just  been  elected  to
represent the South African Parliament in the  Pan-African  Parliament.  The
UDM endorses the recommendations of the Tenth Report of  the  Working  Group
on the African Union, especially in terms of the  reporting  mechanisms.  It
is vital that a committee be established to ensure that  once  members  have
been elected to the PAP, accountability and  two-way  communication  between
this House and the new PAP is established.

Our experience as an established but still young Parliament can add much  to
the growth and development of the PAP. We  are  all  agreed  that  this  new
forum represents a golden opportunity to  deepen  democracy  in  Africa  and
create a stronger, more unified voice for the people of the continent.

The members on whom the honour and duty falls to represent South  Africa  in
the PAP must embrace this opportunity with enthusiasm and  dedication.  They
have to represent  the  best  of  what  this  House  has  to  offer  to  the
continent.

We cannot settle for mediocrity because that would be to  doom  the  PAP  to
the status of a glorified  talk  shop.  The  citizens  of  our  country  and
continent deserve our best talents and expertise. Thank you.
Mrs M A SEECO: Deputy Speaker, the pomp and splendour of  the  establishment
of the African Union last year is history as of now. Work has to  begin  and
that is why we elected our delegates a while ago. We  look  forward  to  our
five colleagues taking their places in the midst of  other  African  members
of parliaments from the mother continent.

We fully support the notion that the organ should not just be a  talk  shop.
Members  should  participate  effectively  and  fully  on  issues  such   as
development and integration of the continent. We  wish  our  delegates  well
during their tenure in the mother of all parliaments  of  Africa,  and  hope
that, much as they may vote in their personal  and  independent  capacities,
they will always put the interests of South Africa first.

Motswana o rile moremogolo go betlwa wa taola, wa motho  o  a  ipetla.  [The
Motswana of yesteryear said that  one  should  make  an  effort  to  develop
oneself, and not always wait for others to do it for him or her.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Speaker, I take this  opportunity  and  congratulate
the five representatives elected to  the  PAP.  The  MF  supports  the  five
members  elected  from  among  ourselves  to  take  up  the   representative
challenge to serve on  the  PAP.  We  are  confident  that  with  these  hon
members, the PAP will be strengthened and be at its best.

Through our diversity, the PAP may  institute  overall  African  integration
that shall unite Africa into a strong global competitor. With  diversity  we
face the risk of being divided but, through our example, it  is  hoped  that
we will use our diversity positively.

Poverty is a major challenge which rapes  Africa  and  its  people.  The  MF
feels that economic integration would play an important role  in  overcoming
it. Members elected from various member countries will hopefully be able  to
operate harmoniously and co-operatively throughout Africa. The  MF  supports
the elected members of the PAP. Thank you.

Mr M F CASSIM: Hon Deputy Speaker, many African countries have  been  urging
South Africa to put forward its candidacy to have the PAP hosted here.  This
is because of, first, the constitutional dispensation we have;  second,  the
role  and  primacy  accorded  to  women   parliamentarians   generally   and
specifically in driving the PAP process as exemplified by the  role  of  the
hon Speaker and Deputy Speaker, amongst others; third,  the  role  given  to
our Parliament to initiate processes and to hold the executive  accountable,
and fourth, the freedom of speech, of assembly and to  organise  politically
that we enjoy.

On account of all of these, our impact  on  the  PAP  will  be  visible  and
substantial. About this, I have  no  doubt.  Let  us  be  really  good  role
models. I support the 10th report.

Mr D J SITHOLE: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  I  must  first  express  a  word  of
congratulations to those who were elected. We also  express  the  hope  that
those who did not make it will find it in themselves to accept that,  whilst
they reduce the National Assembly to an electoral college, we  did  this  to
the best of our abilities as public representatives who were elected by  our
people to do exactly that. [Applause.]

I am delighted to participate in the  debate  on  the  10th  report  of  the
working group. Looking back I am sure that those who  started  the  work  on
the protocol on the Pan-African Parliament in  those  early  days  were  all
excited to discuss what then appeared as a dream - and just a  dream  -  but
now is a reality.

It was a difficult road where hope and persuasion played  a  critical  role.
We had not only to persuade this House to create this working group, but  we
had to work hard to get our colleagues in other parliaments  to  ratify  and
deposit  the  instruments  to  realise  the  creation  of  the   Pan-African
Parliament.

There were those who felt,  at  some  point,  that  we  had  taken  a  wrong
approach in emphasising the regeneration of the African continent. It  is  a
choice we made as the ANC and the South African Government  that,  in  order
for us to grow and live in peace, the regeneration of the African  continent
should be at the centre of our success. We have,  without  fail,  under  the
able leadership of the ANC's presiding  officers  present  today,  submitted
reports of the working group.

I want to highlight a few areas that are critical for  this  House  to  take
note of. Maybe  before  I  do  that  I  must  first  congratulate  the  five
delegates who were elected to serve on behalf of South Africa  in  the  Pan-
African Parliament. I hope that in their work in the PAP they will keep  the
commitment of South Africa to focus in its endeavour on the  building  of  a
culture of good governance, a respect for a human  rights  democracy,  peace
and stability.

These principles will remain meaningless  unless  we  make  them  a  reality
through our work and commitment to deliver a  better  life  to  the  African
poor  and  the  poverty-stricken  masses.  It  is  important  for  the  five
delegates to note that they carry a huge responsibility on their  shoulders,
which is the hope  of  our  people.  It  is  this  hope  that  we  must  not
disappoint. It is our people that look upon this continental body to  evolve
and address their needs.

Let us come back to issues that I  wanted  to  raise  in  this  debate.  The
protocol states that once  members  are  elected  by  their  parliaments  or
appointed by deliberative organs they will, however,  vote  as  individuals.
If this assertion is not  properly  understood,  it  will,  at  some  point,
create difficulty for delegates when they do not know how  to  vote.  Whilst
these delegates will vote as individuals, they will, at all times,  exercise
their right within the broader considerations, not only of our country,  but
also of our region and the continent as a whole.

The question of accountability presents a challenge to  this  Parliament  as
to how we create the  mechanism  for  these  delegates  to  keep  the  South
African Parliament on  track  with  the  deliberations  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament. The question is: Do we want to continue to work  on  an  ad  hoc
basis as we have been working up until now? Members must remember  that  the
working group was established by a resolution of  Parliament  and  when  its
life came to an end, we came back to Parliament to extend its life. Is  that
the best way for us to work?

The working group has, of course, created a legacy of ensuring that all  its
reports are debated in this Parliament. I am aware that there are those  who
see the debates about these reports as  mere  nonsense.  I  can  assure  hon
members that it is necessary  and  critical  nonsense  to  ensure  that  the
issues of the African Union are not confined  to  those  who  serve  in  the
working group but are issues that will be discussed by all  South  Africans.
I hope that whatever we put in place will continue this legacy of  reporting
back, and maybe other committees of Parliament will learn  and  improve  the
mechanism.

But the question must be asked: How do we ensure the process  of  clustering
committees that takes  into  account  the  new  challenges  imposed  by  the
changing realities? As we continue to grapple with this issue as to  how  to
make  parliamentary  committees  function   efficiently,   we   must   avoid
pretending that life is static and changes are therefore  not  necessary.  I
must submit that it is not only the Working Group on the African Union  that
we must consider. We must anticipate issues that will be brought up  by  the
developments in the SADC, PF and the SADC Parliament in the future.

In recent seminars in the continent, parliamentarians have  been  suggesting
committees of some sort to focus on Nepad, as part of our  daily  occupation
as members of Parliament. If we all accept that a particular  emphasis  must
be placed on building a better understanding of Nepad amongst  MPs  and  the
public in general, we must then carefully consider  the  following:  How  do
we, without falling into a trap of creating committees for everything,  deal
with this problem?

In our enthusiasm we  must  resist  the  temptation  of  creating  too  many
committees for every issue that arises. We hope that the presiding  officers
will assist in ensuring that we desist from the temptation  and  our  desire
to form committees. As we engage on this issue, I hope that all of  us  will
find a creative means to utilise what we  have  and  create  new  structures
where we need them. The report recommends that we should  exclude  SADC,  PF
and Parliament, as opposed to our initial  report,  that  is  report  number
eight. However, that should not be understood to mean that the mechanism  we
put in place for the processing of the  African  Union  and  related  issues
must operate in absolute exclusion of the ongoing  discussion  and  possible
development at the level of SADC.

Debate concluded.

The Deputy Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party  moved:  That  the  report  be
adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

   TOWARDS A TEN-YEAR REVIEW: ASSESSING OUR ACHIEVEMENTS DURING THE FIRST
          DECADE OF FREEDOM AND PREPARING FOR THE CHALLENGES AHEAD

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Madam Speaker, hon  members  and  comrades,  the  days  of
darkness are over. Together we have ended apartheid minority rule. The  rays
of dawn have begun to  light  up  our  horizon,  the  light  of  freedom  is
challenging the departing  darkness  of  apartheid  and  the  dark  days  of
despair have given way to the season of hope.

Nearly 10 years ago, when we elected our  first  democratic  Government,  we
were challenged to put the policies  and  institutions  in  place  to  bring
about a better life for all.  Today,  we  as  South  Africans  enjoy  better
conditions of peace and dignity. We have started to build a  united  nation,
joining hands without regard  to  race,  colour  and  gender.  Each  of  our
communities is free, at  least,  to  express  its  linguistic  and  cultural
identity in conditions of diversity, with each  free  to  assume  its  equal
place within our new nation without discrimination.

Inspired by a new patriotism, we can truly say that South Africa belongs  to
all who live in it. The majority of  South  Africans  who  were  victims  of
apartheid are starting to enjoy a better quality of  life.  Women,  workers,
rural communities and people with disabilities  are,  for  the  first  time,
receiving focused attention in Government programmes.

In Gauteng, the Alexandra and Katorus  Urban  Renewal  Projects  are  taking
place through housing developments, new complexes, the rejuvenation  of  the
Jukskei River and road infrastructure. Equally  so,  in  the  Northern  Cape
province, before 1994, there  existed  no  multipurpose  community  centres.
Today, these centres are in Galeshewe, in Limpopo and in Giyani,  and  there
are also places for people to apply for IDs within walking distance.

In the KwaZulu-Natal province, the following milestones have been  achieved:
In our townships of Inanda, today they have two libraries,  they  have  four
clinics and they have five community halls. All  of  that  since  1994.  New
housing developments took place in Bombaai, in Newtown and  others.  Even  a
business centre has been established. The revitalisation of Phoenix and  the
Gandhi settlement are now major tourism attractions.

One of the milestones has been the successful land claim  victories  by  the
Makuleke people. Today, they even  have  tarred  roads  in  rural  areas  in
Limpopo, and electricity in the deep rural areas  of  Malobeni  and  Mafefe.
Free houses have been established in the deep rural areas of Limpopo.

Every South African enjoys the respect of  all  nations  of  the  world.  We
have, as a country, built relations or friendships  with  the  international
community in search of a better world.

Should these changes go on? This is the central  question  that  all  of  us
will have to answer to our people. We, as the  ANC,  will  certainly  answer
``yes''. We will urge all  of  you  to  do  so  and  to  join  the  national
partnership to build a winning nation through an intensified  offensive  for
transformation, reconstruction and development.

To this effect, our public services are also being  transformed  to  reflect
clean, transparent and  good  governance.  It  is,  indeed,  encouraging  to
notice  that  our  Public   Service   has   been   undergoing   a   thorough
transformation over the past few years to make  it  more  efficient  and  to
effect full transformation from instruments of control and manipulation  and
to serve as a vehicle for building our country.

We are, indeed, happy that even in the Eastern Cape, good progress has  been
made with the departmental turnaround plans and the transversal projects  to
improve service delivery, to root out corruption  there,  and  enhance  good
governance. The support for both the plans and the projects  is  spearheaded
by an interim management team which established dedicated  teams  to  assist
the departments of education, health, roads  and  public  works  and  social
development, as well as teams to assist with specific challenges.

We have, indeed, created a  better  life  for  the  youth  of  our  country.
Through the National Youth Commission and the Umsobomvu Fund,  it  has  been
possible to provide some guidance to departments and  interact  with  senior
management to ensure that youth development  is  supported  internally.  The
partnership between the National Youth Commission, the  Umsobomvu  Fund  and
the SA Youth Council has developed a strong  impetus  for  the  decision  we
took in terms of establishing and implementing a national youth service.

 We've also improved the lives of women in our country. For the first  time,
the rights of women are guaranteed by South African law.  Women  have  taken
up their places in government, the public sector and all areas of  life,  as
part of the overall transformation in our country.

We have made, considerable progress in the rural areas. In the ANC, we  have
ended the practice of using the countryside as dumping grounds  where  rural
people are subjected to poverty and abuse and denied their  citizenship  and
dignity. The ANC  has  made  great  strides  in  reaching  rural  areas  and
targeting  the  nodes  of  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural   Development
Programme in the poorer provinces. To date, 28% of  projects  in  the  rural
nodes are in KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape  and  Limpopo  province,  where
poverty is at its highest.

The ANC-led  Government  has  adopted  a  comprehensive  programme  for  the
empowerment of the disabled, and legislation  now  prohibits  discrimination
in  the  workplace.  Today,  the  disabled  themselves  serve  actively   on
government bodies to promote the interests of the disabled.

In our quest for achieving a better life for all, we need  to  build  a  new
patriotism through the building of partnerships with our  Government.  These
partnerships with our people reflect the commitment and passion to create  a
better life for all, and must be based on a common commitment to building  a
better life for all.
However, Government's partnerships are not limited  to  the  youth  and  the
others I have mentioned, but also include the  Letsema  Volunteer  Campaign,
the Imbizo Outreach Programmes, the establishment, indeed, in  each  of  our
areas, of ward committees in municipalities and the  very  important  Nedlac
processes. We have  discussed  the  Expanded  Public  Works  Programme,  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme, Urban Renewal  Programme
and IDPs, just to mention a few.

Yes, there are challenges. Some of these challenges  are  to  create  enough
jobs for those who seek work, addressing the remaining  backlogs  in  water,
electricity, and sanitation infrastructure  and  improving  the  quality  of
further education and training programmes.  For  instance,  in  meeting  our
water requirements on a sustainable basis, it  is  estimated  that,  by  the
year 2025, one in every three of the world's population  would  be  affected
by a shortage of fresh water. Therefore, this year, 2003, is  designated  as
the UN International Year of Fresh Water.

One of the clear conclusions of the  Government's  document  Towards  a  Ten
Year Review is that each and  every  one  of  us  in  the  provinces,  local
government and traditional authorities has  to  continue  to  work  together
with the national Government as partners in order to discharge  our  mandate
to our people to create a  prosperous,  healthy  and  vibrant  multicultural
society.

I am of the view that  the  policies  of  the  Government  are  the  correct
responses to the challenges that our country is facing. I want to  reiterate
that we, as Government, will continue to fight for change and  to  speed  up
our efforts to ensure a better life for all. We need to speed  up  provision
of services to build on what we have achieved and to make  a  bigger  impact
on the daily lives of people.

We will continue to improve quality  of  life,  create  a  better  life  for
women, for youth, for rural people, for children, for the aged and  for  the
disabled. We will continue to work together with our people  to  change  our
society and to improve the lives of our people faster than ever before.

As President Thabo Mbeki said in his New Year's  address  to  us,  in  2003,
``the sun will continue to shine on the South African  people  as  we  build
this nonracial, nonsexist  and  democratic  country,  instilling  in  all  a
shared sense of nationhood and  human  solidarity.''  Indeed,  the  sun  has
shone on all South Africans. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Deputy Chair, Minister, and hon members, I  believe  it  is
appropriate, in the light of the UN recognised and underwritten 16  Days  of
Activism campaign for no violence against women, to pay  tribute  to  women,
that is young and  old,  and  the  children,  as  an  affirmation  of  their
fundamental rights to  respect,  dignity,  safety  and  security,  and  full
participation in matters that affect our collective destiny as a people  and
a nation.

 The issue before us for discussion  is  in  line  with  the  imperative  to
reflect on or evaluate action and  the  related  outcomes  of  that  action.
Reflection, action and reflection, the cliché goes, but it is so true.

In this first decade of  freedom,  we  have  indeed  changed  the  political
landscape of our country drastically. The beacons of political struggle  for
freedom say it all.  The  outcome  of  these  efforts,  culminating  in  our
Constitution and its entrenched  fundamental  rights,  is  something  to  be
proud of - considering our sad, fragmented and unjust past.

We now move on to a better country, to a better future for all  citizens  of
our country, guided and guarded by this selfsame Constitution. As they  say,
the rest is history.

We need to acknowledge the past without harping on it ad infinitum. We  need
to recognise the great strides made and the impact of such  strides  on  the
lives of people, especially the people on the ground. A modest  pat  on  our
collective back is in order, but  excessive  self-congratulatory  indulgence
is  counterproductive.  I  want  to  repeat  that  we  have  positively  and
drastically changed the political landscape of our country.

Our best achievement, considering the kind of past  we  come  from,  is  our
Constitution,  with  its  entrenched  fundamental  rights  and   concomitant
institutions. The only way to  sustain  this  achievement  is  to  jealously
guard and uphold the  selfsame  Constitution  which  ought  to  dictate  our
ongoing development and actions.

It is now possible for people to realise that they can  access  clean  water
and  health  services,   enjoy   the   benefits   of   electrification   and
communication systems, and a variety of other services.

It is not my wish to usurp the  functions  of  the  GCIS  by  unfolding  the
scroll of Government programmes. The Government is obliged  to  deliver;  in
fact, to deliver effectively and consistently.  This  is  no  favour  it  is
doing the people. At this juncture, what really  needs  to  be  done  is  to
qualitatively look at delivery programmes, to detect the  weak  points  with
the aim of improving performance and ensuring sustainability  in  the  light
of good governance and transparency.

The challenges, among others, that remain are within the spheres of  health,
especially when we think of the  HIV/Aids  pandemic,  unemployment  and  the
resultant poverty, crime,  urban  decay  and  rural  development,  including
housing.

Much still needs to  be  done  to  take  preventative  primary  health  care
services to even the remotest areas  of  our  country.  Existing  and  rural
clinics, health care centres and hospitals need more support, resources  and
even conducive working conditions for personnel - medical and otherwise.

The HIV pandemic is not easing either; instead we are  facing  unprecedented
difficulties in this area. Thanks should be given that sanity  seems  to  be
prevailing  now  regarding  the  roll-out  of  antiretrovirals.   Here   the
Government and all and sundry  should  take  note  of  the  lessons  learnt.
Procrastination and political posturing  can  be  detrimental  to  the  very
existence of society. However, it is better late than never.

I need not repeat that crime remains one of the scourges  that  need  to  be
fought tooth and  nail.  Not  enough  has  been  done  thus  far.  In  fact,
perpetrators of crime seem to be contemptuous of the law and  all  judiciary
institutions. The police certainly deserve more support from Government  and
the public to successfully contain and combat crime. ... [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Deputy Chairperson, I regret  that  the
majority of those who will hear what I have to say are the empty benches.

There are two trends within the South African public debate, and  indeed  in
our  national  psyche,  namely  the  intertwined  trends  of  optimism   and
pessimism. These two trends are aptly  collaborated  and  motivated  by  the
findings of our Government's 10-year review  report.  The  report  correctly
highlights our successes in democratising not only the state, but the  whole
of our society and adopting some of  the  best  legislation,  administrative
programmes and Government initiatives possible.

However, even though we have done the right things,  our  results  have  not
been as expected, and the report itself  highlights  major  shortcomings  in
the most critical areas of governance,  such  as  unemployment,  poverty  in
rural areas, economic growth, and crime. These four areas are  major  crises
which ought to force us to reflect seriously and critically on what was  not
done sufficiently well.

 In addition, one could add to those  four  areas  two  other  major  crises
which are  ravaging  our  society  at  all  levels,  namely  the  crisis  of
HIV/Aids, and corruption, in respect of which we also need  to  accept  that
our insufficient results show the inadequacy of what has been done.

Our public finances have been well managed and  the  state  is  in  a  sound
financial position. This, by itself, has not promoted economic  growth,  nor
can it  do  so.  Without  economic  growth  there  has  been  no  employment
generation.

The  measures  recently  announced  by  the  President  are  also  aimed  at
promoting short-term employment, and we know that in  the  long  term  these
are unlikely to stimulate growth, but may  actually  inhibit  it.  Replacing
machines  with  people  is  politically  appealing,  but  is  neither  self-
sustaining nor economically viable, as  the  people  who  produce  machinery
will lose their jobs, and the industrial basis of this country will shrink.

One of  our  Government's  major  failures  has  been  that  of  not  having
developed a plan for a new industrial basis for South  Africa,  which  would
be capable of not only  producing  all  the  machinery  we  need,  but  also
exporting it, which is the only viable way of  generating  employment  on  a
sustainable basis.

For 10 years, we in  the  IFP  have  advocated  the  need  for  implementing
drastic measures to promote economic growth. It is painful to  read  reports
that the President is considering liberalising our  telecommunication  field
because he has been pressurised to do so by foreign investors when  we  have
been pointing to the need to liberalise  all  sectors  of  our  economy  for
almost 10 years.

There is no reason why we should all have to pay exorbitant prices  for  our
telecommunications because of our protectionism,  cartels,  and  monopolies.
This is an example of how many of our policies have failed  to  achieve  the
intended necessary  results  because  of  hidden  reservations  in  pursuing
courageous measures of economic growth and employment generation.

The same applies in respect of the fight against crime, which  is  something
that we could have won if the political will existed to do what it takes  to
achieve these results. Greater  willingness  to  deal  with  crime  has  now
emerged, because of pressures from foreign investors. However, I wonder  why
we should do the right things only because we are pressurised to  do  so  by
foreign investors, rather than doing them for  our  own  sake,  and  because
they are right.

I was a victim of a car hijacking, was  shot  at  and  miraculously  escaped
with my life. My family and I continue to pay more than we  should  for  our
telecommunications. We must do what is right in the real  interests  of  all
South Africa's people, not because we are awakened to it when our  positions
become untenable, and when confronted by foreign investors in  international
meetings and venues.

The 10-year review should offer the opportunity not only to  take  pride  in
what had been done, but also to  consider  the  unfinished  agenda  of  what
remains to be done. This agenda includes the need to change how we go  about
developing policies so as to avoid in future the type of half  measures  and
compromises which have thus far prevented real results from being achieved.

It is obvious that in the past  10  years  we  have  put  in  place  a  good
legislative framework. We must now make it  work  and,  for  this,  profound
changes may be necessary, and we as a country must  have  the  courage,  the
vision and the determination to bring them about, failing  which,  we  shall
have failed  the  many  rightful  expectations  we  have  created  with  our
liberation and in the 10 years which followed it. I thank you.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, I am glad that the hon Deputy  Minister  and
his family survived the car hijacking incident.

During the mid-sixties an American, Allen Drury, wrote a  book  about  South
Africa called A Very Strange Society. To a certain extent, we  are  still  a
very strange society. Where else in the world would a  deputy  president  be
investigated  by  a  parliamentary  committee,  the  public  prosecutor   be
subjected to a judicial inquiry and the chief of police be  threatened  with
having to spend the night in jail? Embarrassing as it  may  be,  it  clearly
shows that  our  young  democracy  has  finally  arrived,  that  we  have  a
democracy in the true sense of the word, where nobody, but nobody, is  above
the law.

  This debate is about the performance of the Government for  the  past  10
  years of democracy. It may  be,  however,  worth  our  while  briefly  to
  revisit the events which resulted in the  first  democratic  election  of
  1994. In his unfinished autobiography, Joe Slovo writes the following:


The apartheid power block was no longer able to continue ruling in  the  old
way and was genuinely seeking some break with the past. At  the  same  time,
we were clearly not dealing with a defeated enemy  and  early  revolutionary
seizure of power by the  liberation  movement  could  not  be  realistically
posed.

It was this acknowledgement which led to the realisation  by  both  the  ANC
and the then NP that it was better to negotiate a settlement than  to  allow
the country to go up in flames. The NP at the time, of course,  was  accused
of having sold out the country by  the  Conservative  Party,  that  has  now
joined the ranks of the Freedom Front Plus and,  of  course,  by  those  AWB
members who are currently still supporting the DA. [Interjections.]
I am, however, proud to belong to one of the parties whose leaders  had  the
vision and courage to save South Africa from  disaster  and  I  also  firmly
believe that the very same recipe of  constructive  co-operation  should  be
used for the main challenges  facing  our  country  as  highlighted  in  the
publication Towards A Ten Year Review.

Unemployment is  undoubtedly  the  biggest  challenge  facing  South  Africa
today. In most developed countries, small and  medium  enterprises  are  the
biggest job creators, but South Africa  falls  well  short  in  this  regard
because, in our country, small and medium enterprises contribute about  half
of total employment. Spectacular incentives are needed  to  stimulate  small
and medium enterprises with a view to creating thousands of  new  jobs.  The
exportation of intellectual capital is costing us  dearly  in  this  regard.
The Minister of Finance said in Parliament that one  of  the  big  furniture
removal companies told him that for the first time in many  years  they  had
moved more people back to South Africa than out  of  the  country.  Now,  of
course, this is good news. But the bad news, however, is that  many  of  the
young skilled entrepreneurs who are leaving South Africa  to  set  up  small
and medium enterprises abroad simply do not have  any  furniture.  All  they
take with them is their  intellectual  capital  which,  of  course,  is  not
subjected to exchange  control  and  these  young  entrepreneurs  should  be
encouraged rather to set up small and medium enterprises in South Africa.

In  sy  outobiografie,  waarna  reeds  verwys  is,  sê  Joe  Slovo  dat   'n
eenpartystaat 'n resep is vir tirannie. Suid-Afrika is nie 'n  eenpartystaat
nie; wat ons wel het, is 'n eenparty-dominante staat binne die  konteks  van
'n veelparty demokrasie, en om te verhoed dat  'n  eenparty-dominante  staat
ook 'n resep word vir tirannie, moet spesiale  aandag  gegee  word  aan  die
bevordering  van  minderheidsregte  in  ooreenstemming  met   internasionale
konvensies in dié verband. En teen die agtergrond van 'n  eenparty-dominante
staat, wat nog lank die geval gaan wees in Suid-Afrika, bly 'n  stelsel  van
samewerkende  regering  die  enigste  geskikte  model  om  na  belange   van
minderhede om  te  sien.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)
[In his autobiography, to which reference has already been made,  Joe  Slovo
says that a one-party state is a recipe for tyranny. South Africa is  not  a
one-party state; what we do  have  is  a  one-party-dominant  state  in  the
context of a multiparty democracy and  in  order  to  prevent  a  one-party-
dominant state from also becoming a recipe for  tyranny,  special  attention
must be given to  the  promotion  of  minority  rights  in  accordance  with
international conventions in this regard. And against the  background  of  a
one-party-dominant state, which will be the case in South Africa  for  quite
some time to come, a system of  co-operative  governance  remains  the  only
suitable model for caring for the interests of minorities. [Applause.]]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, it is an honour  and  a
privilege for me to participate in this important debate close  to  the  end
of parliamentary activities for 2003, and on  the  eve  of  celebrating  our
achievements during the first decade of freedom.

I will not follow the example of two of the previous  speakers,  namely  the
hon member from the DA and the hon  member  from  the  IFP,  who  have  been
overcritical in their assessment of the last 10 years and I  think  that  it
is an opportunity missed by both these parties to not run down  the  country
but also to acknowledge the achievements that we have  made  over  the  past
couple of years and the past decade. So it  is  surprising.  It  is  perhaps
their true colours that are showing, at least where these  two  parties  are
concerned.

In the time allocated to me, I want to emphasise two major  achievements  in
our economic transformation during the past 10 years,  namely  macroeconomic
stability and confidence in our  economy,  and  successful  achievements  to
effectively address the basic needs of poor and disadvantaged people in  our
country, thereby providing a better quality of life for our people.

Before the first democratically elected Government took office in 1994,  the
country  was  economically  isolated  and  the  economy  was  in  a  crisis.
Apartheid resulted in  huge  inequalities  and  increasing  poverty,  rising
unemployment,  negative  growth,  large  budget  deficits,   sanctions   and
unsustainable government debt.

Ten years  later,  South  Africa  has  achieved  a  level  of  macroeconomic
stability not seen in 40 years. The budget deficit has decreased  from  9,5%
of GDP in 1993 to only 1,2% in 2002-03. The total  public  sector  debt  has
fallen from 64% of GDP in 1994 to less  than  50%  in  2002.  The  net  open
forward position of the Reserve Bank has fallen from US$25 billion  in  1994
to zero in 2003. Our foreign reserves have risen  from  one  month's  import
cover to two-and-a-half months' import cover.

Within the short period of less than one decade, we are  receiving  positive
sovereign and investment ratings  by  internationally  recognised  agencies.
These ratings reflect their confidence  in  our  prospects  for  sustainable
economic growth over the coming  years.  This  macroeconomic  stability  has
been achieved through ANC policies implemented  to  date.  There  have  been
ongoing policy engagements  within  the  alliance,  broader  civil  society,
Nedlac and the Growth and  Development  Summit.  Annual  budgets  thereafter
allocate funds to implement departmental programmes.

Today  we  find  that  business,  labour,  community   representatives   and
international role-players come to the ANC Government  with  their  problems
and  suggestions,  because  we  are  committed  to  governing  this  country
effectively. The result was that, in 1999 the electorate  returned  the  ANC
with a nearly two-thirds majority. In 2004 the electorate  will  return  the
ANC with a two-thirds majority, because the  ANC  is  a  caring  Government,
with a vision of decent work and living standards for  all.  The  ANC  is  a
reflection of what South Africa must look like.

Vanaf my agtergrond as 'n blanke Afrikaanssprekende persoon  kan  ek  eerlik
vir u hier sê dat geen regering in  die  geskiedenis  van  Suid-Afrika  meer
gedoen het vir die ekonomiese transformasie  van  Suid-Afrika  as  die  ANC-
regering nie. Binne een dekade  het  die  Regering  ekonomiese  vertroue  en
stabiliteit gevestig wat internasionaal erken  word,  en  terselfdertyd  die
lewensgehalte van miljoene Suid-Afrikaners verbeter.  Dit  is  'n  prestasie
waarop Suid-Afrikaners kan trots wees.  Ek  sien  uit  na  die  dag  wanneer
partye soos die DA en die IVP besluit dit is prestasies wat erkenning  verg.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Against my background as a white Afrikaans-speaking person I  can  honestly
tell you here that no government in the history of  South  Africa  has  done
more  for  the  economic  transformation  of  South  Africa  than  the   ANC
Government. Within  one  decade  the  Government  has  established  economic
confidence and stability that are recognised  internationally,  and  at  the
same time improved the lives of millions  of  South  Africans.  This  is  an
achievement South Africans can be proud of. I am looking forward to the  day
when parties like the DA and the IFP  decide  that  these  are  achievements
that require recognition.]

This brings me to  the  second  issue,  namely  the  successes  achieved  in
providing a better quality of life for our people.  Between  1995  and  2002
the number of people  employed  grew  by  1,6 million  from  9,6 million  to
11,2 million. However, the unemployed also grew by 2,5 million because  many
more people were seeking work. While many unskilled workers are  unemployed,
there are shortages of skilled workers in many sectors.

Many jobs were created during the last decade, but did not  accommodate  all
work seekers. Government has therefore set a goal to  halve  the  number  of
unemployed  by  2014.  This  will  be  achieved  if  all  role-players  work
together,   including   Government,   business,   labour    and    community
representatives.  A  specific  commitment,  reached  at   the   Growth   and
Development Summit, relates to job creation. It will be complemented by  the
Budget, which is a vehicle  for  the  political  objectives  of  Government,
where  significant  investments  by  Government  in  provincial  roads   and
municipal infrastructure, amounting to R56,5 billion  over  the  next  three
years, are already indicated. It highlights our commitment  towards  growth-
enhancing  investment  and  employment  whilst   meeting   social   delivery
backlogs.
The ANC Government endorses the principle  that  infrastructure  development
is a primary driver of economic growth and social development.  The  outcome
of this must be job creation,  poverty  alleviation  and  income  generation
through an Expanded Public Works  Programme  approach.  In  this  programme,
labour-intensive methods of construction, development and  maintenance  must
be used. This represents a different approach  to  public  works  programmes
using a labour base. Credit for this  initiative  must  go  to  the  ANC-led
Government. We  are  serious  in  addressing  the  problem  of  unemployment
collectively with all the role-players.

We reject arguments from the opposition that life in South Africa is now  no
better than before 1994 and that all is  the  same.  This  Government  cares
more than any previous government in South Africa about the poor  people  of
our country and will continue  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  poor
people. For too long have the majority of our people  been  disenfranchised,
socially excluded and neglected. The long walk to freedom  is  reflected  in
this House and is evident within our society.

The redirection of Government spending is  another  significant  contributor
to the improved lives of millions of people. This new  spending  pattern  by
Government addresses the needs and interests of the majority of  the  people
of our country and reflects the demographic reality of South Africa.  It  is
reflected  in  spending  on  education,  health,   water,   sanitation   and
electricity.

Programmes to alleviate poverty have furthermore brought  about  improvement
in the lives of millions. Beneficiaries of social grants are  in  excess  of
the seven million mark for last month, October 2003. These grants,  formerly
allocated on a racial basis, have been equalised and  extended  to  all  who
are in need  and  are  eligible.  Despite  these  successes,  the  challenge
remains to integrate as many people as possible into  the  economy,  whether
in the formal or informal sector where  they  can  participate  in  economic
activities and contribute to our gross domestic product.
In his address to the National Assembly on 12 November  2003,  the  Minister
of Finance, Mr Manuel, said South Africa was a great place to be. What  true
words. As a nation, we are building  a  future  together  across  historical
divides. We have the confidence, we have sound  and  workable  policies,  we
know what the challenges are in our country, and we have  the  determination
to make South Africa a great place to live.

For  the  past  10  years  we  have  successfully  achieved  a  new   ethos:
reconciliation, tolerance and co-existence. Because of  these  achievements,
people feel confident about South Africa  -  people  like  Gary  Player  and
people like Patrice Motsepe, but also ordinary South Africans.

My appeal is that, based on this 10-year review report, we as the  political
leaders in this House,  together  with  millions  of  South  Africans,  will
continuously strive to make South Africa a nonracial, nonsexist,  democratic
and united country, as  embodied  in  the  Freedom  Charter.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]
Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, South Africa is a country at peace  with  itself,
thanks to its peaceful transition to a democratic state.  This  is  no  mean
feat. It is an historical miracle  brought  about  by  skilful  negotiation,
much praying and wise counsel from  many  quarters  within  our  nation  and
around the world.

However, the miracle must be kept alive since there has been  an  increasing
number of challenges that have arisen  over  the  last  10  years  that  are
eating away at the achievements that we have made since 1994.

We commend Government on the macroeconomic  stability,  but  notwithstanding
the strong economy, large-scale poverty and joblessness are still  with  us.
Despite a peaceful transition, a  new  and  much  larger  enemy  stalks  the
streets of our communities, namely that of violence and organised crime.

Despite having a Constitution to protect  citizens  against  oppression  and
injustice, we have corruption and theft within governing bodies on  a  large
scale which diminishes the values of our democratic Constitution. All  South
Africans  can  be  rightly  proud  of  the  work  done  by  the  Truth   and
Reconciliation Commission to avert ongoing  hatred  and  bitterness  amongst
the various groups in our nation.

We pride ourselves on being a secular humanist state but when things do  not
go right and the moral depravity of humans begin to show, we design a  moral
regeneration strategy as  if  we  can  programme  the  behaviour  of  people
according to a set of preferred social mores supervised by the state.

The bottom line is that if one leaves God  out  of  the  equation  of  human
affairs, the rot sets in from the top and right down into  all  of  society,
including  the  moral  regeneration  programme.  The  way  forward  lies  in
partnerships and,  during  the  next  10  years,  let  us  build  meaningful
partnerships and create a South  Africa  where  Government,  civil  society,
business and ordinary citizens work hand in hand, in  a  free  and  peaceful
South Africa.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Chairperson and hon members, any  review  of  the  past  10
years that does not acknowledge the huge constitutional  strides  that  were
taken to establish a democratic society would be inaccurate. Similarly,  any
review that claims that no mistakes have been made and no issues  have  been
neglected would also fail to reflect reality.

Though much has been said of the social  wage,  the  extent  to  which  this
social wage exists is questionable. For instance,  what  percentage  of  the
child grant reaches children and improves their lives? Aside from this,  the
existence of the  social  wage  depends  on  the  assumption  that  all  the
telephone, water and electricity connections that have been made  are  still
connected. This too is pertinently not the case.

In fact, research shows that hundreds of thousands of  households  have  had
these  new-found  services  disconnected.  Sadly  for  the  poor   and   the
desperate,  the  extent  of  the  social  wage  is  a  highly  overestimated
phenomenon.

Furthermore, even if we were to accept, for the purposes  of  argument  that
the social wage is as  widely  felt  as  the  ruling  party  would  have  us
believe,  then  we  still  need  to  take  into  account  the   ravages   of
unemployment.

The social wage is advanced as a justification for the inability of the  ANC
to  make  job  creation  a  reality  that  exists  outside  their   election
manifesto. It is the ANC's way of saying that they  have  not  succeeded  in
every respect but that they have done  enough.  We  disagree  with  such  an
argument. We must do more.

Government must take more active steps to  stimulate  job  creation  and  by
that  we  mean  more  than  promising  infrastructure  development   through
Transnet ... [Time expired.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, as we are about to celebrate 10  years  of
freedom and democracy, we  are,  firstly,  challenged  to  review  the  past
decade as to how we as a new country should face it and whether we  achieved
the goals we set ourselves at the beginning of the decade.

The goals in question are encapsulated  in  the  vision  to  bring  about  a
better life and a just society  and  recognise  and  acknowledge  that.  The
poorest section of our population has the right to enjoy  the  same  freedom
we all fought for.

Today we are free from  all  forms  of  apartheid  laws.  We  are  indeed  a
democratic society but the challenge that we are faced with  as  we  reflect
on our decade  of  freedom  is  to  honestly  ask  ourselves  the  following
question: Is the life we are living in line with  the  type  of  freedom  we
envisaged? Surely, this is a subjective question.

There is no doubt that our country has emerged triumphantly  from  its  ugly
past. South Africa today is counted amongst the best in  world  democracies.
Domestically we have managed to bring to an end  the  political  and  ethnic
violence that characterised the 80s and 90s.

We have managed to draft and produce a model Constitution that contains  the
Bill of Rights. Today our pensioners receive  improved  monthly  grants.  In
terms of hosting events of international magnitude  we  have  excelled  when
given an opportunity. The World Summit on Sustainable Development ...  [Time

Ms S B  NQODI:  Deputy  Chair,  hon  members,  let  me  open  my  debate  by
extracting from an article, ``Mayihlome'', written in the ANC  parliamentary
caucus publication, Sephadi, which reads as follows, and I quote:


  The people of South Africa overwhelmingly voted for the ANC in  the  1994
  and 1999 general elections. These people believed, as they do  now,  that
  the policies of  the  ANC  are  a  correct  response  to  South  Africa's
  challenges. They believe that the Freedom  Charter  is  correct  when  it
  declares that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, both black  and
  white. These South Africans believe in one human race, whose dignity must
  be respected and protected. These people believe that the wealth  of  the
  country must be shared.


  Furthermore, they are committed to contributing to this South Africa  and
  fight against whatever that  seeks  to  bring  back  apartheid,  even  in
  disguised clothes of neo-liberalism.

Upfront, I wish to assure all the sceptics, critics  and  doubting  Thomases
in this House and outside that the 10-year review of the ANC  in  government
in the new democratic South Africa clearly says: ``Thumbs up  to  all  those
believers, all those gallants  and  sons  and  daughters  of  the  soil  who
unreservedly voted for the  ANC.  We  salute  you!  After  a  long  walk  to
freedom, finally, through the ANC, you have reached your destination.  South
Africa now belongs to all who live in it. You made the correct and the  best
choice. You are the winners and victors over the prophets of doom.''

Deputy Chair and members, the summary of the events  and  changes  that  the
people of this country witnessed happening and  unfolding  in  this  ANC-led
democratic Government in the past 10 years is that this has  been  a  decade
of the testing,  trials  and  triumphs  of  the  meaning  of  democracy  and
political freedom for the majority of the  black  people  of  this  country.
This has been a decade of unimagined and unprecedented political and  social
transition and transformation whose effects have  not  only  been  positive,
but also rewarding to the majority of our citizens. It has been a period  of
the restoration of the dignity and human rights of the  formerly  oppressed,
discriminated and dehumanised black people of this country  -  the  rightful
rulers of this country; this, our ancestral mother and fatherland.

Indeed this has been a decade in which the pride,  humility  and  beauty  of
being an African, and in particular a black, has been showcased not only  to
our former colonisers, but to the  world  as  a  whole.  Within  this  short
period of 10 years only, blacks in this country have,  for  the  very  first
time, known, experienced and understood  the  difference  between  apartheid
and democracy, or oppression and liberation; the  meaning  and  benefits  of
enfranchisement, human rights, national identity and patriotism; freedom  to
choose what matters to them first, that is, Batho  Pele,  instead  of  being
told, instructed or dictated to by the powers that be, which was a norm  and
practice during the past regime.

Most important of all, the ANC in this House is proud to say: We  have  been
consistent in changing the profile of the South African society to the  best
of our policies. Indeed, we  are  on  track  in  turning  the  tide  against
poverty eradication and racial discrimination.  We  are  all  proudly  South
African: black and white, young and old.

The ANC rules and the ANC lives. We have delivered, to the astonishment  and
embarrassment of our  opponents,  and  we  will  continue  doing  so.  Aluta
Continua! Through the laws we have passed in  this  House  and  through  our
good governance programmes and projects,  everyone  in  South  Africa  today
enjoys a better quality of life - a fulfilment of both  our  1994  and  1999
election manifestos.

Ndenza amagqabantshintshi ngegalelo likaRhulumente  kule  minyaka  ilishumi,
ngolu  hlobo:  Chu  kuhle,  ngemizimba  engenaxhala,  siyaya   enkululekweni
egqibeleleyo  ebandakanya  abantu  bethu  bebonke  ekuthabatheni  inxaxheba,
ekuxhamleni  ubutyebi  noqoqosho  lweli  lizwe.  Okwakalokunje,   siyazingca
ngeenguqu  nobomi  obungcono   esibunike   iimbedlenge   nabantu   bakowethu
ngeenkonzo zoluntu esithe  sazizisa  eluntwini.  Emva  kweminyaka  engaphaya
kwama-3 000  engcinezelo  kaFaro,  phantsi  kolawulo  lwegcuntswana,  abantu
bakowethu namhlanje bakhuselekile ngenxa  yamalungelo  oluntu  abawaxhamlayo
phantsi kolawulo lukaNkongolo.

Ligqithile   ixesha   apho   inkamnkam    ibisakwamkeliswa    ngocalucalulo,
ngokobuhlanga.  Kunamhlanje  nje  bonke   abantu   abadala   bamkela   imali
elinganayo. Siya kukhumbula ukuba ukungena  kwethu  elulawulweni,  inkamnkam
yabantu abamnyama yayili-140  eerandi  kuphela,  emva  kweenyanga  ezimbini.
Namhlanje umhlophe, umnyama, ufumana ama-750  eerandi  ngenyanga.  Iinkedama
nabantwana abaphuma kumakhaya ahlelelekileyo abaminyaka  ili-14  nangaphatsi
bayabonelelwa  nguRhulumente  ngemali.  Kwiminyaka  emibini  yokuqala   kolu
ncedo, umntwana ngamnye wayenikwa i-100 leerandi, kodwa namhlanje ufumana i-
160 leerandi.

Imfundo ililungelo kubo bonke abantwana, ukususela kumabanga aphantsi  ukuya
kutsho kwibanga lesixhenxe. Kanti  lukhona  noncedo  lweemali  olunikwa  abo
bakumabanga  aphezulu  nakwiidyunivesithi.  Siyazibona  neenkqubo   zemfundo
kumabonakude  ezixhaswa  nguRhulumente,  kulungiselelwa  abo   bangenandlela
yakuya  ezikolweni  ngezizathu  ezahlukeneyo,  umzekelo,  uTakalani   Sesame
esimbukela rhoqo.

Unyango  kumaziko  onyango  lufumaneka  ngaphandle  kwentlawulo   kubantwana
abaminyaka   mithandathu   nangaphantsi.   Ndiqinisekile    ukuba    sisonke
simqhwabela  izandla  uRhulumente  ngesigqibo  asithabathileyo  sokubonelela
ngamachiza  okunceda  abo  baphila  neSifo  uGawulayo   okanye   i-HIV/Aids.
Siyazidla ngenkqubo kaRhulumente yokwakha izibhedlele  neekliniki,  ngakumbi
emaphandleni.

Ngazo zonke ezi zinto, nezininzi endingenakuzibalula ngenxa yexesha,  sithi,
``Ngxatsho ke!''  kuRhulumente.  Sibamba  ngazibini  kuwe  Galel'  ebhayini,
mbuthondini  wesizwe  i-ANC.  Namhlanje  namaqaqa  ayaqikaqikeka   kuqaqaqa.
Sifuna  ukuthi  ke,  lumka  qaqa,  ungaqhawukelwa  nguqhoqhoqho  ngokusoloko
uxokozela okwexoxo emgxobhozweni! Musani ukusoloko  nikhonya  okoomofu  emva
kwemvula.   I-ANC   iyalawula,   iphethe.   Ayijiki   yaye   ayibuyi    mva!
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[This way, I am only giving a summary of the  Government's  contribution  in
the past 10 years of our new democracy. Steadily, with cool  heads,  we  are
heading towards a  fully  fledged  participatory  democracy  where  all  our
people are going to be benefiting  from  the  wealth  and  economy  of  this
country.  At  the  moment  we  are  proud  about  changes  and  better  life
conditions that we have afforded pensioners and other  people  that  receive
grants. Today, after 3 000 years of oppression and rule of only a  few,  our
people should feel protected because of  the  rights  that  were  introduced
under the leadership of the ANC.

The time has passed when welfare grants were received  under  discriminatory
and racial conditions. All aged persons now receive equal  grants.  We  will
remember that when we came into power, the old age pension for black  people
was only R140, and that was received after two months. Orphans and  children
born from poor homes and who are 14 years of age and under,  receive  grants
from this Government. In the first  two  years  after  the  introduction  of
child grants, each child received R100, but the money  has  since  risen  to
R160.

Education is a right for every child,  from  early  childhood  years  up  to
grade 7. For those that reach the level  of  tertiary  education,  financial
assistance is available. On TV we can see  Government-sponsored  educational
programmes, as a means of assisting the disadvantaged.  Takalani  Sesame  is
one such programme and is always screened on TV.

Health care is free for children who are six years and under. I  am  certain
that all of us applaud and commend  the  Government's  decision  to  provide
antiretrovirals to  people  living  with  HIV/Aids.  We  are  proud  of  the
programme of building hospitals and  clinics,  especially  in  rural  areas,
that the Government announced.

We say, ``Thank you!'' to the Government  for  all  these  things  and  many
others. I cannot mention all of them because of  time  constraints.  We  are
grateful to the ANC, as it is the national organisation. We  would  like  to
caution all those who continuously complain but do not say or show  anything
of substance from which people of this country can benefit. The  ANC  is  in
power and the ANC rules.  It  is  not  turning  back,  but  moving  forward!
[Applause.]]

[The ANC ensures that the land of their ancestors should be returned to  its
rightful owners. It is very encouraging to note that  our  Government  works
together with our kings.

The attempts to improve the lives of our people are being implemented. I  am
specifically referring to electricity, roads, clean water, toilets, and  the
eradication of disease from water that is fetched from rivers. Farm  schools
have been placed under the control of the state and farmers.
The ANC also intends to  bring  back  the  dignity  of  our  old  people  by
ensuring that places where they receive their pensions are clean and people-
friendly.]

Deputy Chair, let me conclude by saying that, as the ANC, we are not  afraid
nor ashamed to say openly that what  we  have  done  and  achieved  so  far,
within this short period of 10 years of our rule in  Government,  definitely
has had a profound effect and impact on the lives of  many  of  our  people.
This, however, is just the tip of the iceberg, given the  gigantic  size  of
the iceberg of disparities, inequities and backlogs that we  have  inherited
and which we still have to address as Government.

As we all know, Rome was never built in one day. We believe in ourselves  as
a party; we believe in our policies; and, we believe in  our  people,  their
undaunting and continuous support, the confidence and the  trust  that  they
have in the ANC, that, together with them, despite the  limitations  of  our
resources, this Government has delivered well beyond expectations.

We are aware of the challenges of narrowing the wide gap  between  the  dual
economies that we have inherited of the white minority haves and  the  black
majority have-nots. Government is doing something about  this,  and  we  are
proud of that. We are all aware and supportive  of  Government's  commitment
and intentions to unbundle the economy of this country  by  promoting  SMMEs
and BEE.

Equally so, we are aware of the devastating effects of the  Bantu  education
system under the apartheid regime, which has  deprived  our  people  of  the
necessary skills, computer technology,  literacy  and  qualifications  which
are so necessary today for almost any type  of  job.  However,  the  radical
changes we see and  read  about  that  aim  at  transforming  our  education
system, amongst other things, are targeting this anomaly.

The rising increase in the prevalence of HIV/Aids, which  robs  so  many  of
our youth and an economically active percentage of our population  of  their
lives, is surely a cause for concern to this Government.

Because of all these, we are today confronted with the twin evils of  rising
unemployment and increasing poverty. We  note  with  appreciation,  however,
that our Government's microeconomic and macroeconomic policies  are  so  far
responding positively to all these challenges.

Two major programmes of the Government address income poverty  in  the  form
of income grants and public works. Already, judging by  the  improvement  in
the  quality  of  life  of  both  urban  and  rural  communities,  there  is
definitely no other choice for any rational or  level-headed  South  African
citizen but to vote for the ANC,  again  and  again  in  the  upcoming  2004
general elections. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chair. The Minority Front feels that  our
greatest achievement is our freedom. All other factors help us to  keep  it.
From the ten-year review Government has  appeared  to  be  quite  effective.
However, a few loopholes were noted. We hope that these  loopholes  will  be
filled efficiently in due course.

We have had great achievements socially, even  though  our  challenges  have
been  huge.  Poverty  alleviation  is  one  of   the   greatest   Government
programmes. We have worked hard and our efforts are showing results.

Poverty alleviation through human  capital  has  also  achieved  significant
results. Education, health, water and sanitation, and  electrification  have
been taken to so many previously disadvantaged areas, and  so  has  housing,
among other things, to improve the living conditions of our people.

Over the past 10 years it has been pleasing to note that the Government  has
successfully managed to  ensure  macroeconomic  stability.  However,  issues
holding back greater investment appear to be a  concern,  and  it  is  hoped
that in future these issues will be addressed in earnest.

Crime is rife in South Africa and, while  many  success  stories  have  been
reported on justice, crime prevention and security, it remains a  challenge.
But with the close working relationship of communities, NGOs and  Government
it  is  encouraging  to  note  that  crime  will   be   stamped   out   with
determination.

We, in the ANC Government, have achieved a lot over the past 10  years.  The
repercussions from the apartheid regime have not been easy to clean up,  but
with our tools in place the MF is confident that greater  achievement  shall
be attained in future.

We should not be too hard on ourselves  for  the  loopholes.  The  MF  feels
that, considering what the apartheid regime had left with us,  we  certainly
have come a long way and should continue our journey  to  a  true  democracy
together with the ANC Government.

Usebenzile uHulumeni we-ANC neMinortiy Front. [The  government  of  the  ANC
and the MF has done a good job.] Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter, 'n debat soos hierdie kan  maklik  ontaard  in
'n groot ``brag'' deur die Regering aan die een kant,  en  'n  groot  baklei
deur die opposisie aan die ander kant.

Tydens 'n onlangse evaluasie het die Regering byna  volpunte  gekry  vir  sy
prestasies oor die afgelope 10 jaar. Ongelukkig was dit  'n  evaluasie  deur
die Regering self - dit is 'n geval van Jannie wat sy eie rapport  skryf  en
aan homself 'n A-plus toeken vir elke vak.

Natuurlik is daar pluspunte: die fiskale beheer, die  ekonomie,  die  waarde
van die rand, Suid-Afrika se staanplek  in  die  internasionale  wêreld,  en
dienste wat verskaf is op plaaslike vlak.

Daar is egter ook die druipvakke - ek noem dit net - wat erger is  as  ooit:
misdaad;  werkloosheid;  swak  dienslewering;  administratiewe  onvermoë  om
goedgekeurde fondse aan te wend; en die bankrotsituasie van talle  plaaslike
owerhede.

Ek wil net kortliks fokus op hoe Suid-Afrikaners van  alle  bevolkingsgroepe
na 10 jaar met mekaar saamleef. Daar is 'n enorme wil by  die  meeste  Suid-
Afrikaners om mekaar te vind, om vir mekaar ruimte te gee, en te leef en  te
laat leef. Hierdie wellewendheid onder  gewone  Suid-Afrikaners  word  egter
vanuit ander oorde bedreig, en  die  huidige  Regering  staan  hier  in  die
beskuldigdebank.

Daar is regeringsbesluite wat dele van die  bevolking  vervreem.  Hier  dink
mens aan die sinnelose naamsveranderinge wat 'n  streep  wil  trek  deur  'n
bepaalde deel van ons geskiedenis. Hier  in  die  Parlement  moes  ons  hoor
Pretoria is na 'n moordenaar vernoem.

Daar  is  diskriminerende  regstellende  aksie  wat  talle   Suid-Afrikaners
marginaliseer tot tweederangse burgers. Daar is  'n  totale  miskenning  van
die waardesisteem van 'n groot deel van ons bevolking in die manier hoe  ons
kinders op skool onderrig en opgevoed moet word.

En dan is daar laastens die kwessie van  rassisme,  of  moet  ek  eerder  sê
gewaande rassisme. Twee voorbeelde uit die sportwêreld staan uit:  eers  was
dit Geo Cronjé en nou Kepler Wessels, wat terloops vandag  onskuldig  bevind
is.

Suiwer oppposisie politiek word gerieflik afgemaak as  ``white  arrogance''.
Ek glo dat rassisme onder die deursnee Suid-Afrikaner  aan  die  afneem  is.
Wanneer ongegronde beskuldigings daarvan  kwistig  rondgegooi  word  om  eie
agendas deur te voer, sit dit ons meer as 10 jaar terug.

Voorsitter, ons moet daarteen waak dat die grootste verskil tussen voor-  en
na-94 nie net is dat die pendulum geswaai het  en  die  skoen  nou  aan  die
ander voet is nie. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, a debate  like  this  can  easily  degenerate
into a big "brag" by the Government on the one hand, and a big fight by  the
opposition on the other.

During a recent evaluation the Government scored almost full marks  for  its
achievements over the past 10 years. Unfortunately, it was an evaluation  by
the Government itself -  a  case  of  Jannie  who  writes  his  own  report,
awarding himself an A plus for each subject.

There are positives, of course: the fiscal control, the economy,  the  value
of the rand,  South  Africa's  position  in  the  international  world,  and
services that are rendered at the local level.

However, there are also failures - I just want to mention this  -  that  are
worse  than  ever:  crime;   unemployment;   poor   service   delivery;   an
administrative inability to utilise approved funds; and the bankruptcy of  a
number of local authorities.

I just want to focus briefly on  how  South  Africans  from  all  population
groups live together with one another after 10 years. There is  an  enormous
will amongst most South Africans to find one another,  to  give  each  other
space, and to live and  let  live.  This  courtesy  amongst  ordinary  South
Africans, however, is being threatened from other  quarters,  and  here  the
current Government is standing in the dock.

There are Government decisions that alienate  sections  of  the  population.
Here one thinks of the senseless changing of names which seeks to  wipe  out
a particular part of our history. Here in Parliament we  had  to  hear  that
Pretoria was named after a murderer.

There is discriminatory affirmative action  which  marginalises  many  South
Africans to second-class citizens. There is  a  complete  disregard  of  the
value system of a large section of our  population  in  the  way  we  should
teach and educate our children at school.

And then, finally, there is the issue of racism,  or  should  I  rather  say
supposed racism. Two examples from the world of sport come  to  mind:  first
it was Geo Cronjé and now Kepler Wessels, who, incidentally, has been  found
not guilty today.

True opposition  politics  is  being  passed  off,  conveniently,  as  white
arrogance. I believe that racism is declining  amongst  a  cross-section  of
South Africans. When unwarranted accusations of it are bandied about  freely
to fulfil selfish agendas, it puts us back more than 10 years.

Chairperson, we must guard against the biggest difference between  pre-  and
post-94 only being that the pendulum has swung  and  the  tables  have  been
turned. I thank you.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Deputy Chair, as we review the past nine  years,  Azapo
is alive to the fact that when 1994 ushered in the first-ever elections  for
the majority of our people, we inherited  this  apartheid  system  with  its
norms and values, its Parliament and its rituals,  and  all  the  structures
whose creations were meant to perpetuate oppression.
We also inherited the army,  the  force  whose  training  and  outlook  were
consistent with the past. We inherited  a  prison  system  that  dehumanised
people. For that matter, we also inherited a western  type  democracy  whose
purpose is to enhance western values and norms.

In this fashion we have also indirectly  inherited  political  parties  that
are very good at practising the politics of the  past.  In  short,  we  have
inherited all that used to oppress our people.

All these ramifications, because of the struggles of  our  people,  are  now
withering  away.  Our  responsibility  at  this  moment  is  to  persist  in
dismantling all the aspects of the past system  that  continues  to  oppress
our people.

Azapo also knows that after nine years of democracy,  beneficiaries  of  the
apartheid system are  still  clinging  tenaciously  to  economic  power  and
privileges, and that in order to perpetuate this state of affairs, they  now
``rent'' black individuals and black-controlled companies to  sustain  their
hold on power.

Azapo believes that during ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: ... the  next  decade  we  should  translate  political
power into economic power ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Order, hon member.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: ... which in turn  should  give  power  and  provide  a
better life for our people. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Deputy Chair, it is  important  that  we  reflect  on  our
challenges honestly and realistically.

Late last month, the Government released a self-evaluation entitled  Towards
a Ten Year Review. The review concludes: ``All the  evidence  from  research
suggests that Government has adequately met its objectives.''

But is this indeed a fair and completely honest assessment? There are  major
gaps in the document, as well as serious exaggerations. Most  famously,  the
review makes the bold claim that Government has reduced  inequality  by  41%
through its social spending programmes. This figure was arrived  at  through
a tortuous manipulation of the standard  measure  of  inequality,  the  Gini
coefficient.

South Africa's Gini coefficient, unfortunately, is among the highest in  the
world. We are ranked alongside such notoriously unequal societies as  Sierra
Leone, Brazil, and Columbia.

The review argues that by 2000, the Government was able to reduce  the  Gini
coefficient from officially reported levels of roughly 0,6 to the low  level
of 0,35. To give you some idea of what that means,  a  Gini  coefficient  of
0,35 would place South Africa among one of the top 10 most  equal  societies
in the world. Sweden, Japan, Denmark and Finland all have Gini  coefficients
of roughly 0,35.

The  review's  authors  make  the  unsubstantiated  assumption  that  social
spending by  Government  -  what  they  refer  to  as  a  ``social  wage"  -
represents a real transfer of wealth from rich to poor. This is a  difficult
claim to justify. We know  that  much  of  the  money  budgeted  for  social
spending is either left unspent or is wasted. This year,  for  example,  the
ANC-New NP Government in the Western Cape has only spent R86 million out  of
R423 million in the  housing  budget,  leaving  roughly  80%  of  the  money
unspent. There is also no direct link between social spending and  household
wealth. Clearly, the ``social wage'' argument has severe shortcomings.

The Government's method  of  calculating  the  Gini  coefficient  uses  some
highly dubious statistical methods.  The  review's  conclusions  go  against
what most of us know to be true from our everyday experience -  or,  as  the
President said earlier today, ``we must use our eyes'' - that the rich  have
become richer and the poor have become poorer over the last decade.

The review's findings also  directly  contradict  the  numbers  provided  by
Statistics South Africa, which reported in 2000 that  the  Gini  coefficient
had increased consistently through the late 90s. As of last year,  the  Gini
coefficient had reached a level of between 0,57 and 0,64 ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order.

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: ... and was still climbing. In addition, the  Government's
findings are contested by numerous studies ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: ... Thank you.

Mr O BAPELA: Deputy Chair, I hope you will bear with me.  I've  just  got  a
touch of a cold and flu. The focal area in the debate ... [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, please! Order! Order!

Mr O BAPELA: The focal area in the debate that I will focus on is  the  role
South Africa plays in the international arena and why we  must  continue  to
play that role. As the President said in the NCOP, responding to a  question
often raised also in this House and in the public  arena  as  well  that  we
spend too much time outside:


  South Africa's role in the rest of the world is not going to diminish. It
  is going to increase. It is inevitable, but it is also correct. We, as  a
  country, ought to be particularly sensitive to the fact that we  owe  our
  liberation, in good measure, to other people of the world.

I will, in my input, quantify the argument, demonstrate and  point  out  why
South Africa must be there in the international arena and  remain  a  member
of the community of nations for the benefits that come with such a role  and
our commitment to build a better world.  The  report,  Towards  a  Ten  Year
Review, is a review that primarily reflects on Government's  performance  in
realising its objectives, and it does not seek  to  examine  in  detail  the
evolution of various sectors of society in the period under review.

It is expected that other organisations in the  areas  of  sport,  arts  and
culture, universities, professionals,  intelligentsia,  trade  unions,  NGOs
and CBOs, private sector, women's formations,  health  bodies,  etc,  should
conduct their own assessments which, together with this  review,  will  help
inform the nation's evaluation of itself in the first decade of freedom.  We
hope that everybody and every citizen, through  their  formations,  will  do
their evaluations about our  10  years  of  freedom  and  map  achievements,
successes,  difficulties,  challenges  and  failures  as   part   of   their
contribution towards a nation assessing itself.  This  will  help  us  as  a
nation to chart a way forward after celebrating, as  we  move  into  the  10
years of the second decade.

The following are some of the  characteristics  of  South  Africa  pre-1994.
South Africa was an apartheid state  in  isolation  from  the  rest  of  the
world, with very few friends internationally; economic, cultural and  sports
sanctions were imposed on apartheid South Africa; South Africa  was  at  war
with its neighbours - the Maseru, Gaborone and Matola bombings and  killings
are  examples  of   this;   South   Africa   financially,   materially   and
ideologically  supported  counter-revolutionary  groups  with  a   view   to
overthrowing other governments; South Africa was  involved  in  the  war  in
Angola; South Africa used slush funds  in  sanction-busting  activities;  it
funded agencies for propaganda with a view to improving its  bankruptcy  and
damaged image in the world  community  of  nations,  and  South  Africa  was
suspended from membership of the OAU,  UN  and  other  international  bodies
such as Fifa, etc.

In  today's  South  Africa,  we  are  proud  that  it  is  recognised  as  a
significant and strategic player, a  peacemaker  and  builder  of  a  better
world. South Africa is promoting international  respect  for  human  rights,
democracy and good governance. In concert  with  other  states  and  through
multilateral mechanisms such as the UN, OAU - now the AU - and  SADC,  South
Africa has played a meaningful role  in  the  promotion  and  protection  of
human rights, and on the guidance  of  the  African  Charter  on  Human  and
Peoples' Rights. South Africa is a member of international bodies  including
the UN, all Bretton Woods institutions, the Nonaligned  Movement  and  other
continental bodies. Our leadership is respected and  is  in  demand  on  the
continent and in the world. It is also consistent  in  promoting  Africa  in
the whole world. So our role therefore, as leaders, is to engage and  ensure
that, indeed, we make the world a better place to be.

Since 1994, we have also seen the growth of  representations  of  diplomatic
missions in the country. According to the 10-year review report, in 1989  we
had 41 missions, in 1994 they grew to 80 and in 1995 they went  up  to  105.
We continue to have more diplomatic missions  coming  to  South  Africa  and
South  Africa  also  establishes  other  missions  all   over   the   world,
particularly regarding  south-to-south  co-operation  and  Africa.  And,  we
still continue to strengthen our representation  in  most  of  the  northern
countries.

I would also like to add that due to our role in  the  international  arena,
we have hosted many conferences and many more  are  still  coming  to  South
Africa. Those conferences also brought benefits to our  people  through  job
creation, procurement, hospitality services and  the  consumption  of  goods
and services. These conferences  have  also  marketed  South  Africa,  which
today is receiving thousands if not millions through tourism. Some of  those
who are coming here are the very  people  who  attended  those  conferences.
They are coming back with  their  families,  wives,  husbands,  friends  and
others who have heard from  those  who  were  in  South  Africa  about  this
beautiful country and, hence, tourism is growing.

We are thrilled to mention some of the conferences: the Unctad ninth  summit
in 1996; the Nonaligned Movement summit in 1998; the AU launch in 2002;  the
World Aids Conference in 2000;  the  African  Union  Summit;  the  UN  World
Conference Against Racism in 2001; the Conference of  African  Ministers  of
Finance, Economic Development and Planning in 2002; the Rugby World  Cup  in
1995; the African Cup of Nations in 1996; the Athletics World Cup  in  1998;
the  All  Africa  Games  in  1999;  the  Cricket  World  Cup  in  2003;  the
international boxing  matches  that  are  continuously  staged  here;  Nepad
business meetings and many, many others.

We hope that when we debate and assess the  second  decade  of  freedom,  in
2014, we will do so having hosted the 2010 World Cup, if we win the bid.  We
should, in the next decade, attempt to host the Olympic Games and we  should
also host the Pan-African Parliament, if South Africa wins the bid. So  when
we debate in 2014, we hope, therefore, that we will embrace  these  elements
and celebrate our achievements on them.

Mr D H M GIBSON: But you're going to be old in 2014!

Mr O BAPELA: Don't worry, I will still be there in 2014 and  I'll  still  be
in the majority party, in this Parliament.

Since the 1990s, Government has embarked on an active imaging, branding  and
marketing campaign  of  South  Africa.  Our  Government  has  put  in  place
programmes  and  initiatives,  some  in  partnership  with   nongovernmental
initiatives, for promoting the Proudly South African  campaign.  The  events
appear to have been instrumental in accounting for the  upsurge  in  tourism
to South Africa, in addition to an attractive  exchange  rate  for  tourists
and perceptions of the country as being  relatively  safe  from  extremists'
acts. For example, tourist arrivals in 1998 were 5,7 million, in  1999  they
were 5,8 million and in 2002 they  went  up  to  6,8  million.  That  is  an
indication of the confidence that the world has in South Africa.

Lastly, we are also getting involved in international  bodies.  We  interact
and play a role when the need  arises.  We  balance  this,  obviously,  with
domestic  challenges  in  order  to  achieve  the   realisation   of   Nepad
objectives. Building peace and stability on the continent will make us  grow
our economy and trade with African countries;  promote  democracy  and  good
governance for sustainable development; speed up the transformation  of  all
institutions and agencies; and, support and  strengthen  multilateralism  at
regional, continental and global levels.

In conclusion, I would like to relate a story of a man I met  on  the  plane
on Sunday, as I was coming here. He was returning from the Rugby  World  Cup
in Australia. As we were getting off the plane - he was a  white  patriot  -
he ran down the stairs to the tarmac, kneeled down  and  kissed  the  ground
and said, ``It's great to be back.'' He then spoke to us as we were  waiting
for a bus and said, ``If only South Africans could acknowledge  and  realise
what a great country we have.'' [Applause.]  He  continued  and  said  that,
yes, we have problems but that he thought we will go through those  problems
and resolve them. Besides everything, those challenges are there  but  South
Africa is a great place to be. I honour such a man and other people who  can
speak like that. [Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Chairperson, today there has  been  a  lot  of  talk
about a document called Towards a Ten Year  Review.  Let  me  say  from  the
outset that any reasonable and objective assessment of the first  decade  of
democracy will acknowledge that the Government has had  both  successes  and
failures.

But, the document in question makes bold to state that, and I quote:


  All the evidence from research suggests that  Government  has  adequately
  met its objectives.

This, I'm afraid, is patently untrue.  For  millions  of  our  fellow  South
Africans there are ways in which life is no better now. The  hard,  shocking
truth is that, in some ways, for so  many  of  our  people,  life  has  even
become worse. We are still plagued with poverty. It  is  a  fact.  A  decade
into freedom, black South Africans are poorer on average than they  used  to
be.

And there's unemployment, the primary cause of destitution and poverty.  I'm
the first to concede that jobs have indeed been created, but a million  jobs
have been lost. And there  is  Aids,  a  disease  that  is  spreading  death
through our land. For the President of South Africa, Aids  is  nothing  more
than a philosophical hobbyhorse, which he rides badly most of the time.

These are only some of the challenges we  face,  but  they  are  not  simply
policy challenges or problems with administration  or  budget  difficulties.
These are human tragedies. But I'm not here to say  what  is  wrong  without
proposing alternatives - solid, workable alternatives.

The  DA  has  outlined  the  policy  programme  for  positive  change   that
recommends brave and  fundamental  reforms  that  will  guide  South  Africa
towards the position of prominence it richly deserves. Our policy  on  crime
proposes that we increase the police force of South Africa so that  we  have
150 000 trained and fully equipped policemen on the streets where  we  live.
Our economic  policy  makes  job  creation  and  real  economic  growth  top
priorities. Our policy on  poverty  includes  support  for  a  basic  income
grant, which would fundamentally change the lives  of  the  poorest  of  all
South Africans - a basic income grant.

All of these policies are based on  the  same  premise:  that  South  Africa
urgently  needs  radical  and  fundamental  change.  We  believe  that  this
important 10-year mark and the elections that  will  soon  be  upon  us  are
about a clear choice for South Africa's future. South  Africans  can  choose
the status quo endorsed by the Government - the same  failed  policies,  the
same failed politicians, the same  stagnant  development,  a  dreary  future
defined by state control and one-partyism - or they can choose  the  DA  and
the coalition for change and invite the bold reforms that  will  make  South
Africa, in a second decade of freedom, truly free, truly vibrant  and  truly
better for all South Africans.

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, I have a long, prepared  speech  here,  but  with
all these things that the opposition parties have come up with now, I  don't
know whether I should perhaps just put my speech to one side and respond  to
some of them.

Firstly, let me say to Cassie Aucamp, you are sounding more  and  more  like
the DA, only you are speaking in Afrikaans. [Laughter.]  You  must  make  up
your mind about what you want to say and do. Secondly, I want to say to  the
hon Redcliffe that when the President spoke  about  us  having  to  use  our
eyes, he meant that if we looked around, we would still  see  that  many  of
the inequalities that were caused in the past, by the  old  apartheid  laws,
still prevail, and that we've  got  a  long  haul  to  go  with  respect  to
inequalities. We must not hide our feelings and fool ourselves and say  that
those things don't exist.

Thirdly, what I want to say to Nick, and I was hoping that Mr  Gibson  would
speak, because he is so predictable ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, it is hon Clelland-
Stokes.

Mr M S  MANIE:  Chairperson,  I  forgot  his  surname;  Mr  Clelland-Stokes.
[Laughter.] Because Mr Gibson is predictable, you know  that  regardless  of
whatever he is going to say, he is going to want  to  attack  and  criticise
us. You can even prepare your speech along those lines. The opening line  of
my speech - let me read it to you - states: The DA  is  so  predictable,  we
know that all they will have  to  say  about  the  past  10  years  will  be
negative. On the other hand, what else can they do but  criticise?  They  do
not have the power to change anything anyway. But  when  they  did  get  the
opportunity - you remember they got a small window of opportunity ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is the hon member  making
the speech that he would have made if I had spoken? [Laughter.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  member,  take  your  seat,
please. Thank you, hon member, you may continue.

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, when they got  the  opportunity  -  for  a  short
period of time they were in control of the Cape Town municipal area  -  what
they left behind was utter chaos. [Interjections.] In fact, they  said  that
they would do this, they would do that, they would put  so  many  people  on
the streets and they would  solve  the  country's  problems.  You  can  talk
through the problems, but coming up with solutions is  something  completely
different.

When you had the opportunity you could not do it, because if  you  had  done
it, we would not have had the problems that still exist  there  now,  right?
[Applause.] I want to say to some of these members that it would do  them  a
lot of good to think back to the period just prior to 1994, when  they  were
stocking up on their canned  food,  buying  candles,  ammunition  and  guns.
[Interjections.] They must remember that period and what they thought  would
happen. If you want to assess South Africa,  you  can't  assess  it  without
looking at the past where we come from, the experiences that people  had  at
that time and where we are now, if you want to be honest about it.

 Of course, it is very difficult for them to be honest.  I  don't  know  how
they are going to cope with that. They must also look at what  it  was  that
we, who were oppressed by the discrimination in  the  past,  came  from.  We
couldn't live where we wanted to live. They determined the laws on where  we
had to live. [Laughter.] We couldn't travel on the buses or trains where  we
wanted to, we couldn't get the jobs that we wanted to do ...

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is  the  topic  the  last  10
years or the last 50 years? [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, that is  not  a  point  of
order. Hon member, you may carry on.

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, hon members, you see,  when  we  talk  about  the
real things that people  suffered  prior  to  1994,  when  people  were  not
allowed to do things like travel on the buses  and  the  trains,  when  they
couldn't even go to the beach,  and  now  you  don't  agree  ...  You  can't
understand what it is, and then you have comments like  the  one  Mr  Cassie
Aucamp is making now, because he doesn't know what  it  was  to  go  through
those experiences. So, it can only be a joke to him. [Interjections.]

I am telling you that when we look at  how  we  assess  what  we  have  gone
through for the last 10 years, we start there from  those  experiences,  and
we can speak about what we have experienced ourselves. [Applause.]

Mr Clelland said - hon Mr Clelland-Stokes - nogal [what is more],  that  the
poor have not seen the benefit of our policies. What do they know about  the
poor? [Interjections.] When have you been to the poor? Do you know  what  is
going on in the townships? [Interjections.] Do you know the  suffering  that
people are going through? [Interjections.] Don't speak about the  poor;  you
will make me cross. I will roll up my sleeves and  you  will  see  something
else. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Order!  Hon  member,  please
withdraw that. We have freedom of speech here, but no fracas. [Laughter.]

Mr M S MANIE: Deputy Chairperson, I withdraw  that.  But  what  I  think  is
important is for us not to forget that all of  these  things  that  happened
should be put in a context in which  the  experiences  of  what  people  are
feeling - what they are going through now and where they have  come  from  -
are taken  into  account.  Of  course,  there  are  many  problems.  We  all
acknowledge that South Africa has many problems  that  it  must  still  deal
with.

But many of those problems took them decades to create,  and  they  are  not
going to be solved in a period of 10 years.  To  remind  you,  in  these  10
years, we had to come up with a new Constitution.  That  is  something  that
other people take decades just  to  draw  up.  We  had  to  take  all  those
apartheid laws and we had to replace them with  new  democratic  laws;  just
that on its own would have taken us 10 years in another country.

On top of that, we have extended services regarding which you  discriminated
against our people. You said they couldn't get the same pensions,  the  same
schooling or the same houses, all of those things. We have managed to do  so
much. [Interjections.] I think what the  President  has  indicated  here  is
that we, as a country, have done much more than most countries can say  they
have done in 10 years for the people of their countries.

All I want to say, and I am going to conclude on this note, is that  we  can
have a much better country here if all  the  people  work  together;  if  we
don't spend our time  having  to  react  to  the  policies,  objections  and
contradictions that we get, especially from the DA. Because,  if  they  were
working with us, we could be taking those backlogs and together  be  finding
solutions  for  them.  But  they  want  to  retain   that   old   privileged
relationship of ``Baas en Klaas''. That  can  never  come  back  again.  But
instead of trying to retain it, I am asking you: Why don't you try and  gain
votes on those things? Because the fear factor is the  wrong  one.  You  are
just polarising our society. It makes it more difficult for us  to  build  a
nation where everybody forms part of the nation, because you  are  not  part
of the process of  building  a  nation.  You  are  in  fact  polarising  our
country, especially with policies like ``fighting back''.

 As one of my comrades said earlier, our policy is based  on:  South  Africa
belongs to all who live in it - black and white. We are saying that we  want
to create a better life for all. They are saying, on the  other  side,  that
they are fighting back. They are fighting those things back.  It  shows  you
that they have a long way to travel. Maybe we must all  pray  for  them  and
hope that one day they will also be able to  see  the  light,  and  help  us
create a new country for ourselves. Thank you. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

         appointed as chairperson.


     Report to be considered.

2.     Report  of  the  Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Powers  and  Privileges   of
     Parliament, dated 26 November 2003:


         The Ad  Hoc  Committee  on  Powers  and  Privileges  of  Parliament
         reports as follows:


         1. The Committee was established pursuant to a  resolution  of  the
              House  on  5  April  2001.  It  was  tasked  to  consider  the
              recommendations  of  the  Joint  Subcommittee  on  Powers  and
              Privileges and the draft Bill prepared  by  the  Subcommittee,
              and to introduce a Bill in accordance with chapter 13  of  the
              Rules of the National Assembly.


         2. A copy of the draft  Bill  was  published  for  comment  in  the
              Government Gazette of 11 July 2001. Two workshops were held at
              which Members and members of the public could make inputs. The
              Committee considered no less than twelve drafts  of  the  Bill
              over a period of more than two years. Initially the  Committee
              held conferring meetings with the Ad Hoc Select  Committee  on
              Powers and Privileges of Parliament of the National Council of
              Provinces, but that Committee had to withdraw from the process
              due to the nature of the Council's programming.


         3. On  25  November  2003  the  Committee  agreed  on  the  Powers,
              Privileges  and  Immunities  of  Parliament   and   Provincial
              Legislatures Bill [B 74 - 2003], and thereafter introduced the
              Bill by submitting a copy thereof to the Speaker in  terms  of
              Rule 243.


         4. With regard to the contents of the Bill,  the  Committee  wishes
              to draw attention to the following:


              (1)  The  Constitution  provides  for  freedom  of  speech  in
                  Parliament and provincial  legislatures,  subject  to  the
                  rules and orders. Therefore, the Bill does not  deal  with
                  aspects such as the manner and form in which  Members  are
                  to exercise their freedom of speech  as  Members  and  the
                  limits  of  their  freedom  of   speech.   The   Committee
                  recommends that the  respective  Rules  Committees  should
                  ensure that these aspects are  adequately  dealt  with  in
                  the relevant standing rules and orders. In particular,  it
                  is recommended that the rules should as  far  as  possible
                  codify behaviour that is regarded as unparliamentary.


              (2) The Committee noted that there are two apparent lacunae in
                  the  Constitution  with  regard  to  freedom  of   speech.
                  Firstly, the Constitution does  not  specifically  provide
                  for freedom of speech in joint sittings of the two  Houses
                  of Parliament. Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to address  this
                  issue. Secondly, there is no provision in  section  45  of
                  the Constitution that a  Deputy  Minister  who  is  not  a
                  Member has freedom of speech in a joint committee.  It  is
                  recommended  that  these  aspects  be  referred   to   the
                  Constitutional Review Committee for attention.


              (3) A further matter that should be noted with regard  to  the
                  constitutional provisions relating to  freedom  of  speech
                  in Parliament is that an official in  the  national  or  a
                  provincial  executive  has  freedom  of  speech   in   the
                  National Council of Provinces and its committees, but  not
                  in the National Assembly or  before  a  committee  of  the
                  Assembly or a  joint  committee  (section  71,  read  with
                  section 66, and sections 45 and 58 of  the  Constitution).
                  In the Committee's view it is advisable that there  should
                  be consistency in the freedom  of  speech  provisions  for
                  the Houses;  accordingly,  it  is  recommended  that  this
                  aspect should  also  be  referred  to  the  Constitutional
                  Review Committee.


              (4) The Committee was requested to consider whether  the  Bill
                  should deal with the question of reflections upon  members
                  of  the  judiciary  and  the  institutions  mentioned   in
                  Chapter 9 of the Constitution.  In  the  Committee's  view
                  this is also a matter that should be  dealt  with  in  the
                  standing rules,  since  any  restriction  in  this  regard
                  would amount  to  a  limitation  of  Members'  freedom  of
                  speech, which is a matter for  the  rules  and  orders  in
                  terms  of  sections  58(1),  71(1)  and  117(1)   of   the
                  Constitution.


              (5) The Committee considered  whether  the  Bill  should  make
                  provision for privileges and immunities  relating  to  the
                  Pan-African Parliament and the SADC  Parliamentary  Forum.
                  In the Committee's view that matter  should  be  addressed
                  in separate legislation.


              (6) Clause 12(2) provides that a House must appoint a standing
                  committee to deal with enquiries relating to  disciplinary
                  action against Members for contempt. In  terms  of  clause
                  12(3), the standing committee must conduct  its  enquiries
                  in accordance with a  procedure  that  is  reasonable  and
                  procedurally fair. It is recommended  that  the  procedure
                  should be set out in the relevant rules,  and  that  those
                  rules should  be  in  place  when  the  legislation  takes
                  effect.


              (7) Clause 13(d) envisages that the rules will  provide  which
                  acts, in addition to those specified in clause 13(a),  (b)
                  and (c), constitute contempt (or  a  breach  or  abuse  of
                  parliamentary  privilege).  It  is  recommended  that  the
                  Rules  Committees  consider,   amongst   others,   whether
                  reflections on members of the  other  House  or  of  other
                  legislatures and the deliberate misleading  of  the  House
                  or a committee should be declared contempt.


              (8) In the light of the provisions of  the  Bill  relating  to
                  penalties for contempt,  Part  3  of  Chapter  15  of  the
                  National Assembly Rules will have to be reviewed,  amongst
                  others in relation to the commitment  of  Members  to  the
                  custody  of  the  Sergeant-at  Arms  (rule  320)  and  the
                  maximum amount of a fine (rule 321).


              (9) The Committee considered whether the Bill  should  provide
                  for  loss  of  membership  or  other  sanctions  for  non-
                  attendance  of  meetings  of  the  Houses  or  committees.
                  However, in the Committee's view  this  matter  should  be
                  dealt  with  in  the  respective  rules  and  orders,   as
                  envisaged by sections 47(3)(b), 62(4)(e) and 106(3)(b)  of
                  the  Constitution  and  sections  3(5)  and  6(6)  of  the
                  Remuneration of Public Office Bearers Act, 1998.


              (10)The Committee also considered whether  provisions  of  the
                  draft Code of Conduct for Members should  be  incorporated
                  into the Bill, but in the Committee's view  it  would  not
                  be advisable to do so. Therefore, it is  recommended  that
                  matters such as Members' conflict of  financial  interests
                  should be dealt with in the Code of Conduct.


              (11)The Bill does not make any provision with  regard  to  the
                  financial  arrangements  of  Parliament   and   provincial
                  legislatures since the Committee has  been  informed  that
                  the matter is to be dealt with  in  separate  legislation.
                  It is proposed that in the  interim,  section  31  of  the
                  existing Powers and Privileges of  Parliament  Act,  1963,
                  which  regulates  Parliament's   financial   arrangements,
                  should remain on the statute book (clause 31 of the  Bill,
                  read with the Schedule).


              (12)Chapter 8 of the Bill provides for the application of  the
                  legislation   to   provincial   legislatures.   Provincial
                  legislatures will have to establish in how far  their  own
                  legislation and rules need to be adapted or  supplemented.
                  In  particular,  attention  is  drawn  to  the  fact  that
                  Chapter  5  (Witnesses)  will   not   be   applicable   to
                  provincial  legislatures  since  section  115(c)  of   the
                  Constitution requires this aspect  to  be  dealt  with  in
                  provincial legislation or the  rules  and  orders  of  the
                  respective provincial legislatures.
              (13)In addition to the abovementioned cases that  require  new
                  or amended rules, arising from the legislation,  provision
                  will have to be made  in  the  Rules  in  respect  of  the
                  following, amongst others:
