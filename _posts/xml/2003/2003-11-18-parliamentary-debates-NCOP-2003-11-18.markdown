            SUSPENSION OF SOUTH AFRICA'S AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Chair, I hereby move without notice as follows:


  That the House notes that -
  (1) aving previously rejected  a  motion  calling  for  the  Minister  of
       Foreign Affairs to suspend South Africa's Ambassador to Indonesia, Mr
       Norman Mashabane, reconsiders its position ...

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I rise on a point of  order.  If
such a motion has been made in the past, there is no point in repeating  it.
It is against the Rules.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I think it is  normally  the  Chair  who  would
make a ruling with respect to the Rules.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Thank you, Chair.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Let us proceed.

Ms C BOTHA: May I complete before you give your ruling?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: [Inaudible.]

Ms C BOTHA:


  (1) ... reconsiders its position in the light of the fact that subsequent
       to Mr Mashabane having been found  guilty  in  December  2001  of  21
       charges of sexual harassment, he has again been  found  guilty  at  a
       disciplinary  hearing  last  week  on  a  further  charge  of  sexual
       harassment committed from his position as ambassador, which  position
       he has occupied without interruption despite his previous conviction;


  (2) instead, his victim has been moved to Korea;


  (3) his appeal has still not been finalised;


  (4) Foreign Affairs Minister  Dlamini-Zuma's  failure  to  conclude  this
       matter can be considered as having created a foreseeable  opportunity
       for further misdemeanours on the part  of   Ambassador  Mashabane  as
       well as the impression that  Ambassador Mashabane is above  the  law;
       and
  (5) demands that Minister Dlamini-Zuma instruct his immediate  recall  to
       South Africa and action on his appeal.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, as you are well aware in  terms  of
the Rules, you cannot propose a motion of the same  substance  as  a  motion
attempted earlier for presentation before the House.

I will look at the content of the resolution you have tabled now, because  I
note certain elements which are  different  but  the  substance  appears  to
remain the same. I will then render a ruling on the matter. I am  not  going
to table it, because I do believe it is in contravention, but we  will  make
a definitive ruling later this afternoon after studying the substance.

  (5) commends the SANDF on  their  continued  openness  and  for  striving
       towards equal representivity in all spheres of life.

     CONGRATULATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ON IMPROVED HEALTH CARE
                                  SERVICES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride the achievements of the  Government  since  1994  to
       provide health care that is affordable and accessible  to  all  South
       Africans;


  (2) acknowledges in particular -


       (a)  that there are now over 4 350 public health care  access  points
           available to the population;


       (b)  the elimination of deaths due to measles and  the  reduction  in
           polio as a result of increased rates of immunisation; and


       (c)  the increase in the utilisation  of  antenatal  care  facilities
           resulting in a dramatic decrease  in  births  without  antenatal
           care; and


  (3) commends the Minister of Health and her department for the  excellent
       work they have done in making access  to  affordable  health  care  a
       reality for millions of poor South Africans.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   TAXI-RELATED VIOLENCE IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the death of six passengers in KwaZulu-Natal taxi  violence  on
       Tuesday;


  (2) further notes that the attack on the Stanger  Taxi  Association  came
       after two members of the rival Mapumulo Taxi Association were shot in
       Kwadukuza on Thursday last week;


  (3) believes that the dispute  between  the  taxi  associations  revolves
       around the exclusive use of taxi ranks and certain routes;


  (4) further notes  that  19  people  have  been  killed  in  taxi-related
       violence in Kwadukuza since June this year; and


  (5) therefore urges the Minister of Transport to intervene and to  ensure
       that the perpetrators of violence in the taxi industry are brought to
       book.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I would want to alert members to  ensure
that their  motions  are  directed  at  the  appropriate  Minister  who  has
responsibility for that particular area, because we do direct  motions  that
are adopted to the executive for action.

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the prestigious President's Cup in golf  is  scheduled  to
       commence at Fancourt near  George  on  Thursday,  20  November  2003,
       between an international team captained by the  "Black  Knight"  Gary
       Player and an all-American team captained by Jack Nicklaus;


  (2) also notes that the world's top three golfers, No 1 Tiger Woods, No 2
       Vijay Singh and No 3 our own Ernie Els, will no doubt  be  vying  for
       top honours on Sunday;


  (3) welcomes the world's leading golfers to South Africa and wishes  them
       a most enjoyable stay in our country;


  (4) further notes that, although the Springboks have been eliminated from
       the Rugby World Cup finals, the South  African  flag  will  still  be
       flying high when our own Andr√©  Watson,  assisted  by  another  South
       African, Jonathan Kaplan, referees  the  final  match  between  hosts
       Australia and England; and


  (5) congratulates these leading South African referees for  the  singular
       honour they bring to South Africa.

                   OPENING OF DIABETES CENTRE IN ALEXANDRA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with joy the opening of the state of  the  art  Lilly  Diabetes
       Centre in Alexandra by a pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly;


  (2) further notes that the opening comes in the wake of a global study of
       diabetes which concludes that people suffering from diabetes  run  an
       increased risk of developing kidney and heart diseases;


  (3) commends the ongoing contribution of companies such as Eli  Lilly  in
       providing  a  much  needed  treatment  and  testing  centre  for  the
       residents of Alexandra and beyond who suffer from diabetes;


  (4) acknowledges that a coordinated response between the  Government  and
       roleplayers in the health sector is crucial to combat these and other
       diseases; and


  (5) calls on other companies in the private health sector to  assist  the
       Government to provide greater  access  to  health  by  ensuring  that
       public  health  considerations  take   precedence   over   commercial
       interests.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: You're not objecting,  Mr  Kolweni?  Oh,  okay,
because Mrs Lubidla is looking at you.

                    ACDP'S DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FUNDING

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House notes that -


  (1) the ACDP has become the first political party  in   South  Africa  to
       voluntarily open its books and disclose  private funding;


  (2) the  ACDP  has  submitted  audited  accounts  for  scrutiny  to   the
       Institute for a Democratic South Africa - Idasa -  because  it  feels
       political  parties  should  support    political   transparency   and
       accountability to the  electorate;


  (3) Idasa has welcomed our disclosure that complies with  their   request
       to reveal the sources of private  donations,  and   has  subsequently
       dropped legal action against the ACDP   but  will,  however,  proceed
       with legal action against the  ANC, DA, New NP and IFP;


  (4) we believe the ACDP is setting the example, and  we  encourage  other
       political  parties  to  release  this  information   to   help   curb
       opportunities for corruption  and   a  conflict  of  interest  within
       political parties and the   Government,  because  it  is  vital  that
       voters do not feel the need to question the legitimacy  of  decisions
       made on their behalf because of the influence of donors;


  (5) the ACDP has stood firm in the face of  pressure  from  a  particular
       donor who wanted to influence the party's  economic  policy,  but  we
       indicated that we would only accept  the  donation  on  condition  it
       would not influence  our policies;


  (6) South Africa requires a system of  government  that  is  transparent,
       accountable, representative and open, and the ACDP feels that this is
       a good opportunity to show our willingness to do just that;


  (7) the ANC, DA, IFP and New NP are on record as wanting to oppose  court
       action to reveal their donations as  they  believe  disclosing  names
       will hinder their ability to raise funds, whereas the  ACDP  believes
       that parties that refuse to disclose their donations and sources must
       be questioned as to what they are trying to hide; and


  (8) the ACDP challenges other parties to follow our example.

I thank you. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of motion.

                                 COMPETITION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates Pastor Mary Crockett of Qwaqwa in the  Free  State  who

       unselfish service to the community in many areas, including Aids, the
       provision of food and study loans to poor students;


  (2) notes with pride  that  she  has  also  been  nominated  for  further
       international recognition; and


  (3) further notes that she has achieved everything in spite of  the  fact
       that she grew up an orphan.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   COMPLAINTS REGARDING RECENT INCIDENTS AT PENSION PAYOUT OFFICES IN NEW
                            GERMANY AND PINETOWN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby propose without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note -


       (a)  of complaints received by New NP Councillor, Esther Bawden, from
           elderly pensioners regarding recent  incidents  at  the  pension
           payout offices in New Germany and  Pinetown,  KwaZulu-Natal,  to
           the effect that a certain man was demanding amounts  of  R100,00
           from pensioners to ostensibly fund a new political  party  known
           as  "The  KwaZulu-Natal  Liberation  Coalition  of  the  Rainbow
           Nation" and when they refused  they  were  threatened  with  the
           words "I know where you live and I will get you"; and


       (b)  that there were young men who were ostensibly  selling  land  to
           pensioners for R100,00, which land was then found  not  to  even
           exist;


  (2) requests the SA Police Service in  KwaZulu-Natal  to  whom  the  said
       incidents were reported to give special attention to the  information
       brought to their attention;


  (3) also requests the SA Police Service countrywide to give attention  to
       the protection of pensioners at pension payout points; and


  (4) calls on pensioners to immediately report any  similar  incidents  to
       the nearest SAPS station and to their public representatives so  that
       their safety and protection against these criminals can  be  ensured,
       because it is only together that we can succeed in turning  the  tide
       against the criminals.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                CLOSING OF HOME AFFAIRS OFFICE IN RUSTENBURG

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B THOMSON: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the closing of the Home Affairs office  in  Rustenburg  by  the
       Department of Labour for contravening health and safety regulations;


  (2) expresses its concern that this is  the  third  Home  Affairs  office
       closed for similar reasons in a short space of time;


  (3)  acknowledges  the  important  role  Home  Affairs  offices  play  in
       providing the poor with identity documents in order to access  social
       grants and participate in democratic elections; and


  (4) calls on the Department of Home Affairs to urgently  look  into  this
       matter.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                  INVESTORS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Madam Chair, I rise to submit a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges the ongoing efforts being  made  by  the  South  African
       Government to promote South Africa as  a  preferred  destination  for
       investors and tourists;


  (2) notes in this regard that our reputation as a  preferred  destination
       was significantly enhanced when  South  African  products  scooped  a
       number of awards at this year's World Trade Market in London;


  (3) believes our success  is  a  reflection  of  the  growing  confidence
       investors have in the South African economy  despite  the  negativity
       displayed by some sectors of our society; and


  (4) congratulates all the South African exhibitors on  their  world-class
       products and on having made South Africa proud.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
                     RACIST ACTIONS IN THE WESTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr C M DUGMORE (Western Cape): Chairperson, I would  like  to  move  without
notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the existence of affidavits alleging racist statements  made  by
           the two DA councillors in the  City  of  Cape  Town  during  the
           registration weekend in which they referred to our President  in
           derogatory racial terms;


       (b)  the unspeakable attack on Nosipho  Mkhize  from  Edgemead  by  a
           fellow student, her mother and her boyfriend; and


       (c)  the attempts by the DA in the Western Cape  to  exonerate  their
           councillors and  their  silence  in  regard  to  racism  in  our
           schools, on the farms and at the workplaces in the Western Cape;




  (2) therefore resolves to commend the ANC, members of the  community  and
       parents from Edgemead High School for tackling the  issue  of  racism
       and supporting the Mkhize family;


  (3) calls on -


       (a)  the Human Rights Commission to speedily complete their   inquiry
           into the allegations against the two DA  councillors;


       (b)  the people of the Western Cape to expose racism at  all   levels
           of our society; and


       (c)  the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  to
           speedily complete  the  trial  of  those  who  attacked  Nosipho
           Mkhize; and


  (4) urges the Western Cape department of education to take firm steps  to
       eradicate racism in whatever form from all of our schools.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of motion.

                  PAYMENT OF MUNICIPAL ACCOUNTS IN TSHWANE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) while acknowledging the  obligation  on  consumers  to  pay  for  the
       municipal services they are using, recognises that  many  people  are
       not able to do so because of unemployment and poverty;


  (2) further recognises the  increased  financial  burden  caused  by  the
       accumulation of interest on arrear accounts on  people  that  already
       find it difficult to keep up with their municipal payments;


  (3) commends the decision by the Tswane Metro Municipality to  write  off
       interest  amounting  to  R156  million  on  arrear  accounts  in  the
       municipality; and


  (4) expresses the hope  that  this  decision  will  positively  influence
       people to realise that the Council is prepared to meet  them  halfway
       provided they make an extra effort to pay their municipal accounts.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                            NATIONAL HEALTH BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson and hon members,  thank  you  very  much
for the opportunity to address the NCOP and I  am  pleased  to  present  the
National Health Bill. It comes almost at the  end  of  the  second  term  of
office of our democratic dispensation. In the last almost ten years we  have
been operating on a very old Bill, the Health  Bill  of  1977.  This  really
means that not much transformation  has  taken  place  with  regard  to  the
Health Bill in this country.

Let me also hasten to say  that  this  National  Health  Bill  has  been  in
consultation ever since I was the chairperson of the Portfolio Committee  on
Health in 1994. There has really been wide consultation  around  this  Bill,
so it really gives me pleasure to  present  it  to  the  NCOP  today.  I  am
conscious  that  you  are  passing  another  milestone  in  the  process  of
reshaping our system.

The Bill, as many of you will  appreciate,  is  key  to  the  fulfilment  of
Government's   constitutional   obligation   to   ensure   the   progressive
realisation of the right of access to health care services in  the  country.
The provinces, more  than  most  Government  structures  and  organisations,
understand just how complex and intractable  challenges  related  to  health
care services can sometimes be. Provincial health  departments  are  at  the
coalface when it comes to service delivery in our country. It  is  they  who
often witness first-hand, the obstacles that people encounter  in  accessing
health  services:  The  poor  state  of  roads  leading  to  services,   the
difficulties  in  attracting  human  resources  to   outlying   areas,   the
logistical  problems  of  ensuring  that  health  technology  is  adequately
maintained in the rural  environment  and  the  challenges  of  transporting
medical supplies and personnel  across  considerable  distances  every  day.
These and other issues like them need to be addressed  on  all  fronts  from
the angle of appropriate strategy, adequate  finance,  enabling  legislative
provisions and the development of operational competency.

It is  critically  important  for  us  to  enact  laws  that  will  lay  the
foundation for efforts on all other fronts to  ensure  equitable  access  to
health services for all. The Constitution itself acknowledges  the  enormity
of our task in allowing the progressive realisation of the right  to  access
to health  care  but  progressive  legislation  means  that  we  must  start
somewhere. We are going somewhere. We must be making progress.

The National Health Bill is a legislative road map, it is a sound route  and
the mechanism by which we intend to fulfil our obligations and  achieve  our
goals. It indicates the form our efforts will take to ensure both equity  in
access to health services and equity in the quality and standards  of  those
services throughout our country. It informs and  emphasizes  the  rights  of
users and providers of health care services.  The  need  for  a  legislative
framework that can be easily understood and used  by  health  service  users
and providers, in both the public and private  sectors,  is  therefore  very
obvious.

Within the different spheres of Government we need to  understand  what  our
respective obligations are in the delivery of health services  and  we  need
to make sure  that  we  have  the  power  to  fulfil  them  efficiently  and
effectively. Unnecessary duplication of health  services  between  provinces
and municipalities is a wastage of scarce resources and also  creates  legal
and logistical problems. Within the public and private health sectors it  is
important  to  improve  and   maintain   standards   and   ensure   adequate
distribution of health services. The National Health Bill seeks  to  address
these issues.

As I said at the beginning, over the ten years it has taken us to draft  and
consult on this Bill, it has become clear  that  equitable  distribution  of
health  services  does  not  happen  on  its  own.  Active  intervention  of
Government is necessary to identify priorities and  get  people  to  take  a
fresh look at the real health challenges that face our nation. In the  South
African health sector in particular we have inherited huge  imbalances  from
the  past  that  market  forces  have  proved   incapable   of   correcting.
Consequently  we  need  legislative  measures  that  would  enable   us   as
Government to take certain corrective measures. I will not go through  every
chapter of the Bill in detail, since  I  am  sure  all  of  us  are  already
familiar with it. I would like to explain some of the principles within  the
Bill, especially those of interest to the provinces.

The Constitution requires the national executive to set national policy  and
prepare and initiate legislation. The provinces in their turn are given  the
executive authority to  set  provincial  policy  and  prepare  and  initiate
provincial legislation. The Constitution requires that the three spheres  of
Government  respect  each  other's  authority  and  powers.  No  sphere  may
encroach on the authority of the others. This power-sharing  arrangement  is
further complicated by the fact that health services are a function area  of
concurrent legislative jurisdiction of the national and  provincial  spheres
of Governmment.

In preparing the Bill we have been very careful to take cognisance of  these
constitutional principles and have obtained the advice of all the state  law
advisors as well as independent experts  on  the  constitutionality  of  the
Bill. In its draft stages the  Bill  was  presented  to  both  the  PHRC,  a
committee of the heads of the national and  provincial  health  departments,
and a meeting consisting of  all  the  political  heads  of  health  sitting
together with their operational counterparts. This was to ensure  that  full
account was taken of provincial concerns and interest  in  the  delivery  of
health services. The Bill was also  published  for  public  comment  and  we
received  a  number   of   very   useful   comments   from   provinces   and
municipalities, which we incorporated into later  drafts.  Consequently,  we
are satisfied that the Bill preserves the integrity of  each  of  the  three
spheres of Government and allows them the freedom  to  operate  unrestricted
by the others.

In Chapters 3 and 4 of the  Bill  the  primary  mechanisms  for  determining
health policy are established: they are the national and  provincial  health
councils, which take into account the principle of  co-operative  governance
but at the same time, acknowledge the powers of the Minister  and  the  MECs
to determine policy in the national  and  provincial  spheres  respectively.
There is provision for representation of the municipal sphere of  Government
in both these structures.

Chapter 5  of  the  Bill  deals  with  municipal  health  services  and  the
interphase between municipalities and provinces in the provision  of  health
services. It is important to emphasize that the provisions of  this  chapter
had to be sufficiently flexible and take  into  account  the  many  possible
permutations that arise with regard to the provision of health  services  by
municipalities.

The Bill sets municipal health services as the  lowest  common  denominator.
This is the type of  service  every  municipality  is  required  to  provide
effectively and equitably in this kind of operation. Due to  the  fact  that
different types of municipalities can have  different  functions  and  these
functions can at times change, we have avoided  being  overprescriptive.  We
have tried rather to provide a legal framework which would  ensure  adequate
service delivery at all levels.

Over and above  that,  municipal  health  services  were  renowned  for  the
possibility that municipalities may provide other types of  health  services
by means of agreement with the relevant provincial  government.  The  formal
agreement is a constitutional necessity, as section 156 of the  Constitution
requires national and provincial governments to assign,  by  agreement,  the
administration  of  certain  matters,  including   health   services.   Such
assignments can only take place if the service  would  be  most  effectively
administered locally and if the municipality has the capacity  to  undertake
it. I am sure that you are all aware  that  municipalities  vary  widely  in
terms of their capacity and resources and for this reason  alone,  one  must
provide for a variety of possible scenarios.

On the issue of compliance, we have indicated in the Bill that  there  is  a
need for mechanisms, both at national and provincial levels, to ensure  that
the Bill's objectives are met. There is provision  for  an  inspectorate  of
health in each province to be established by  the  relevant  MEC.  There  is
also provision for an office of standards  compliance  within  the  national
Department of Health. It  is  envisaged  that  these  structures  will  work
together in a relationship of mutual co-operation and support  in  order  to
ensure that the provisions of the Bill  are  both  revered  and  that  users
receive the quality and standard of health care to which they  are  entitled
as citizens of this country.

There is no point in passing framework  legislation  such  as  this,  unless
everyone at every level of Government is committed to ensuring  that  it  is
effectively and efficiently implemented. I trust that you will bear this  in
mind and lend  us  your  wholehearted  support  when  the  Bill  is  finally
implemented.

The issue of a single blood service was considered at length, and it  was  a
very difficult discussion and debate. After much thought,  we  decided  that
it was the right way to go. The reason for this amendment, is that blood  is
a national resource. Everyone must be assured of access to it, whether  they
live in a big city or in a remote rural  area.  There  is  also  a  need  to
ensure uniformly high safety standards in  our  blood  service,  because  we
face a significant risk of contamination through blood-borne diseases. I  am
sure you  will  agree  that  we  cannot  afford  to  risk  compromising  the
integrity of such a vital resource.  Furthermore,  it  is  contrary  to  our
moral, social and ethical values for blood to be  treated  as  just  another
commodity of trade, and for donors and their blood  to  be  the  subject  of
competition.

We took a decision not to create  a  state-run  national  blood  transfusion
service, but to leave it in the  hands  of  the  private,  not  for  profit,
sector. This seemed a more appropriate arrangement because the  donation  of
blood is indeed a voluntary act. However, it is  very  important  to  ensure
that  the  nation's  blood  supply  is  unified,  uniform   and   universal.
Fragmented blood services are more difficult to monitor and control  than  a
single one. They are made  for  inefficiencies  since  the  opportunity  for
economies of scale is limited and there  is  a  possibility  of  unnecessary
duplication.

There is also the risk that the supply of blood in one area will  be  better
than in others, for  reasons  ranging  from  donor  distribution,  community
disease profiles and cultural  beliefs.  The  cost  of  supplying  blood  to
remote areas could make this life-giving  resource  more  expensive  to  the
rural areas and for the  poor,  unless  such  cost  is  spread  through  the
creation of a single national service. For all  of  the  above  reasons,  we
have therefore provided, in law, for the recognition of  a  single  national
blood system and service.

I wish to dwell for a little while on the  subject  of  the  certificate  of
need;  a  subject  that  was  deliberated  extensively   also   during   the
submissions to the portfolio  committee.  The  provisions  of  the  National
Health Bill relating to a certificate of need are  the  tools  by  which  we
intend to address the  inequitable  distribution  of  health  services  over
time. The provision is certainly not unique  nor  particularly  new  in  the
South African context. For many years in  South  Africa,  traders  have  not
been able to set up shops and businesses anywhere that  they  pleased.  They
could only establish  them  in  areas  approved  for  that  purpose  by  the
authorities.

The policy reasons for this are obvious. One needs to  maintain  a  suitable
and appropriate distribution of shops and  businesses  in  relation  to  the
residential areas, and to make sure that the  needs  and  interests  of  the
communities in which they operate are served and protected. I  do  not  hear
traders,  business  owners  and  shopkeepers  complaining   that   this   is
unconstitutional. In many other countries,  including  the  United  Kingdom,
the United States of America, Canada and Australia,  there  are  systems  of
licenture of  medical  practitioners,  nurses,  dentists  and  other  health
professionals. Licenture does not always include conditions as to where  one
may set up practice and what kind of service one may provide, but  it  often
does.

Sometimes these conditions are implicit in the system. In the United  States
for instance, medical doctors licensed  to  practice  in  one  state  cannot
necessarily ... Sorry, I didn't touch the gadgets, but  something  happened.
May I  continue?  In  the  United  States,  for  instance,  medical  doctors
licensed to practice in one state  cannot  necessarily  lawfully  do  so  in
another. They are restricted in terms  of  their  licence  to  a  particular
geographical area. In Germany, there are regional restrictions for  setting-
up a medical practice with compulsory  health  insurance  based  on  overall
levels of demand and supply.

According to the World Health Organisation,  equity  in  health  care  means
that health resources are  allocated  according  to  need.  Health  care  is
provided in response to the legitimate expectations of  the  people.  Health
services are received according to need,  regardless  of  prevailing  social
attributes, and payment  for  health  services  is  made  according  to  the
ability to pay. The certificate of need process is not  intended  to  be  an
instant remedy to  the  problem  of  the  inequitable  distribution  of  all
professionals and health establishments in our country.  The  emphasis  will
be on implementing it progressively, to  achieve  the  right  of  access  to
health care services. Let us not be naive. We recognise that  it  will  take
time to achieve this objective.

Pessimists may  argue  that  we  will  never  achieve  a  totally  equitable
distribution of health care services because it is an  ideal  that  few,  if
any other countries in the world  seem  to  have  achieved.  But  access  to
health care for  all  is  our  constitutional  goal.  We  do  not  take  our
Constitution lightly, nor are we a nation of  pessimists.  The  Bill  allows
for  regulatory  distinctions  to  be  made  between  situations  of  health
professionals with established practices or existing  health  establishments
and those who set up a practice or develop an establishment after  the  Bill
comes into effect. It is  not  our  intention,  after  the  Act  comes  into
effect,  to  immediately  order  existing  medical  practices   and   health
establishments to close down and relocate to a place chosen by the state.

Transformation of a national health system is not effected overnight. It  is
not our intention to act contrary to  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution
concerning the limitations of rights. But I  want  to  point  out  that  the
Constitution  does  allow  for  the  limitations  of  rights  and  sets   up
parameters for them. We believe that the Bill conforms to  these  parameters
and gives us the legislative tool to effect the  much-needed  transformation
of the health sector in our country.

I believe that we  have  done  our  best  to  present  to  you  a  piece  of
transformative legislation that will go a long way towards assisting  us  in
achieving  our  strategic  goals  in  the  health  sector  -  and  that   is
transforming our health sector. There is often inborn resistance to  change,
as you know. People usually prefer the devil  that  they  know.  But  we  in
South Africa are not strangers to change. Since  1994,  we  have  had  ample
opportunity to witness what a positive thing it can be.  Change  can  really
be a positive thing. Let us take this Bill as an opportunity to  effect  the
changes that our heads and hearts tell us are necessary in order  to  create
a more humane and healthy South African society.

In conclusion, I would like to thank Ms Loretta Jacobus  and  the  committee
for the sterling work that they have done in processing the Bill.  We  thank
them for the amendments that they have effected and we  trust  that  the  NA
portfolio committee will endorse these amendments. Let  me  also  take  this
opportunity to thank the officials of the Department of Health  led  by  Mrs
Matsau - the acting Director-General of Health. In particular, I would  like
to take this opportunity to acknowledge Dr Kenny Chetty who headed the  team
responsible for developing the Bill. And as  I  said  at  the  beginning,  I
would also like to thank the committee in this House for having assisted  us
to come thus far. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, I have always wondered why, when I  sit  down  to
write my speech, there is always a fly on the wall. I  now  know  who  sends
the fly, it is the Minister, because she has taken so much of what I  wanted
to say. However, be that as it may, hon Minister, MECs - I see  one  present
here - special delegates from provinces and  members,  the  Bill  before  us
today is the result  of  six  years  of  hard  work  by  the  Minister,  her
predecessor, her department, their  counterparts  in  the  provinces  and  a
whole range of stakeholders; all of  whom  made  valuable  contributions  to
this piece of legislation. It was also subjected to  Minmec  discussions  on
numerous occasions where the political heads of health of  provinces,  which
are  the  MECs,  made  inputs  on  behalf  of  their  respective  provincial
governments.

The National Health Bill also went  through  rigorous  public  hearings  and
interrogations by our portfolio committee in the National  Assembly.  Again,
it  was  subjected  to  further  public  hearings  and   interrogations   by
provinces. Therefore, I am convinced that what we are passing here today  is
the  product  of  very  hard  work  by  our  parliamentary  committees,  our
counterparts in the provinces and interested stakeholders at large.

What remains a concern to us is the lack of participation from  Salga.  They
were invited to the initial joint briefing of the Bill  and  the  subsequent
two day workshop that followed. For reasons not known to us,  they  did  not
arrive. In Gauteng they were invited to the briefing,  the  public  hearings
and the committee discussions that followed, and again  they  did  not  show
up.

The NCOP has a constitutional mandate to represent both the  provincial  and
local spheres of Government at a national level. Without the voice of  local
government, this mandate becomes a bit difficult to carry. The sense  I  get
is  that  this  lack  of  participation  by  Salga,  especially  around  the
processing of section  76  legislation,  is  a  common  occurrence  in  most
provinces, if not all.

Therefore, I would appeal to your good selves, as the presiding officers  of
this institution, to raise this matter with the leadership  of  Salga  as  a
matter of serious concern. As we  round  off  this,  our  second  democratic
Parliament, and move towards the inauguration of our third,  let  those  who
will arrive after us not be faced with the same challenge  as  us  are  here
today.

In Gauteng, we had public hearings, and people as far the Western Cape  came
to make submissions into our process. They came from as far as  the  Western
Cape to make input into our public hearings, and we perceive that  as  quite
good, because we had far-ranging views appearing there.

The Bill before us establishes a framework for a structured  uniform  health
system  within  the  country,  taking  into   account   our   constitutional
obligations and other laws within the  three  spheres  of  Government  which
relate to health services. In doing  so,  it  recognises  the  socioeconomic
injustices, imbalances and inequities of health services of  the  past,  the
need to improve the quality  of  life  of  all  citizens  and  to  free  the
potential of each and every South African.

In terms  of  section  27(2)  of  our  Constitution,  the  state  must  take
reasonable legislative and other measures within  its  available  resources,
as the Minister said, to achieve the progressive realisation  of  the  right
of citizens of  South  Africa  to  have  access  to  health  care  services,
including reproductive health care. In terms  of  section  28(1)(c)  of  the
Constitution, every child has a right to basic health care services, and  in
terms of section 24(a) of the Constitution, everyone has  the  right  to  an
environment that is not harmful to their health or wellbeing. It is  against
this backdrop that this National Health Bill before us  today  has  come  to
fruition.

The Minister has already given a very fair and good overview  of  the  Bill.
However, I would just like to highlight a few areas around which  there  was
considerable discussion during our deliberations as a committee, as well  as
during the public hearings that took place in some of the provinces. I  will
not elaborate too much, because other colleagues will speak  about  them  in
more detail.

Clause 36 of the Bill deals with the certificate of need, and  the  Minister
has also mentioned that  particular  clause.  It  requires  any  person  who
wishes to establish, construct, modify or acquire a health establishment  to
apply to the Director-General of Health for such a certificate.  Before  the
director-general issues such  a  certificate,  he  or  she  must  take  into
account a whole range of considerations. One being the need  to  promote  an
equitable distribution of rationalisation of health  services,  health  care
resources, and the need to  correct  inequities  based  on  racial,  gender,
economic and geographical factors.

By way of an example, take for instance the distribution of private  medical
practitioners and health care facilities in general in the urban  areas,  as
opposed to their distribution in rural areas. One will  have  to  look  long
and hard to find a doctor or a health care facility in the deep rural  areas
of some of our provinces, whilst in the city centres, one can  find  one  of
these almost within a five kilometre radius of each other.

Just as it does not make sense to have two greengrocers next to each  other,
it does not make sense to have two hospitals or doctors' rooms next to  each
other. Before issuing such a  certificate,  the  DG  will  have  to  satisfy
himself or herself that the need does exist for  such  a  facility  at  that
particular location, as requested by the applicant. Therefore,  we,  as  the
committee, are of the opinion that the certificate of need  will  complement
the constitutional right of every South African  citizen  to  access  health
care, health  care  facilities  and  the  equitable  distribution  of  these
resources and facilities.

The  other  area  which  aroused  considerable   debate   was   Chapter   8,
particularly clause 53. This clause deals  with  the  establishment  of  one
national blood transfusion service. Currently, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-
Natal are the only provinces with their own blood transfusion services.

We cannot argue with the fact that blood is a national  resource.  The  Bill
therefore makes provision for the Minister to establish a blood  transfusion
service for the Republic through  one  licence  holder,  which  is  able  to
provide this service throughout the territory of the  Republic.  The  holder
of such a licence will be  obliged  to  comply  with  certain  requirements,
which are also set out in the  Bill,  and  the  Minister  has  spoken  about
those.

Anybody other than the licence holder who  provides  such  a  service  would
then be in contravention of the law and, therefore, guilty of  a  punishable
offence. One of the most important reasons for inserting  this  clause  into
the Bill is the concern for blood safety. I am sure we are  all  aware  that
blood is the  one  bodily  fluid  that  sustains  all  one's  vital  organs.
Therefore, the utmost care has  to  be  taken  to  ensure  its  safety.  The
department has at least four documented  cases  of  litigation  against  it,
because  of  the  transfusion  of  unsafe   or   contaminated   blood   into
individuals. This National Blood Transfusion Service will look  at  a  whole
range of areas, paramount of these being the insurance of blood safety.

Other areas that solicited debate from provincial inputs was that,  firstly,
no mention was made of the role of traditional healers in the  provision  of
health care services. Traditional healers were very vocal in the  provincial
public hearings that were held. Their second concern was around  clause  43,
dealing with the minimum standards and requirements  for  the  provision  of
health services in locations other than health establishments, for  example,
initiation schools in particular. Here they felt that their role  and  input
had not been taken into account.

After careful scrutiny and input by  the  provinces,  the  select  committee
proposed further amendments, as the Minister said, to  the  National  Health
Bill. These have been tabled, and I will,  therefore,  not  dwell  on  them.
However, it is safe to say that they do not detract from  the  substance  of
the Bill. They also make the Bill read better, and in fact,  add  positively
to its substance. I have had informal discussions  with  my  counterpart  in
the National Assembly,  and  they  seem  to  be  agreeable  to  the  further
amendments proposed by ourselves. You can rest assured that  the  Bill  will
not go to mediation.

In conclusion, I would like to thank the Minister  and  her  department  for
all the assistance given to the committee  during  the  processing  of  this
Bill. The whole of the department's senior leadership  are  seated  there  -
there are too many to mention - but they are all there for us to see.

I think now is also the  opportune  moment  for  me  to  recognise  and  pay
tribute to our previous director-general,  Dr  Ntsaluba,  for  the  role  he
played in the department in general, and particularly the role he played  in
the drafting and processing of this National Health Bill. It is  unfortunate
that he cannot see the Bill to its conclusion. As we all know,  he  has  now
taken up an even more demanding position, namely  that  of  Director-General
of Foreign Affairs. But as a committee, we would  like  to  thank  him  most
sincerely for his always-willing assistance and  guidance  during  the  time
that he was with us, and we wish him well in his new position.

Thanks also go to the members  of  the  committee,  the  provinces  and  all
stakeholders who took the time to interact with us  on  matters  which  they
found of concern. Last, but not least, a big  thank  you  to  Johannes,  the
Minister's parliamentary liaison officer, who always  shuttled  between  her
office and us to ensure that everything went smoothly.

With these words, I submit to the House the committee report in  support  of
the National Health Bill with the additional amendments, as adopted  in  the
last committee meeting of the  26th.  May  I  also  just  say,  during  that
committee meeting eight provinces supported the Bill  with  its  amendments,
and  one  province,  namely  the  Western  Cape,   abstained.   Thank   you.
[Applause.]

Mr C M DUGMORE (Western Cape): Thank you very  much,  Madam  Chair.  As  the
previous speaker mentioned, I've got  a  difficult  task  today  because  my
organisation, the ANC, both within our  province  and  nationally,  supports
this Bill 100%. We feel it is an important tool to promote  effective  care,
co-ordinating within our perimeters, and believe that it will in fact  bring
about much energy and strengthen our public health system.

Our MEC in the Western Cape, Mr Piet Meyer, was unfortunately  not  able  to
be here today, and I have been asked to speak on behalf of the  province.  I
am sure that we find  it  very  strange  sometimes  that  whenever  our  ANC
Government brings legislation which aims to transform our country, to  bring
about equity, and in this case, accessible  health  care,  particularly  for
the poor, it is organisations like the DA that resist and  decide  to  fight
back.

This House, I believe, should be reminded that when our  Minister,  who  was
then  the  Chair  of  the  National  Assembly  portfolio  committee,  passed
legislation around the pricing of medicines which aimed to ensure access  to
cheap medicines for all South Africans, it was  the  DA  who  voted  against
cheap medicines for the people of South Africa. Today, through  the  efforts
of our Minister and the members that worked then, we  see  the  benefits  of
this legislation. Many generics are now  available  at  far  less  than  the
branded product price and in fact chemists have a duty to inform the  public
that a generic actually exists. But it was the DA who  stood  up  and  voted
against cheap medicines. That is what they did.

We will also remember in this House that community service for  doctors  and
other health  professionals  was  described  then  by  the  DA  and  certain
elements within the South  African  Medical  Association  as  Stalinist,  as
dictatorial  and  unworkable   and   yet   today   in   our   province   ...
[Interjections.] This member on the left is mumbling something, saying  that
they were right. I want to tell him, Minister, that in our province, we  are
seeing the benefits of  community  service  in  Elsies  River,  Khayelitsha,
Mitchells Plain and our rural areas, where those community  service  doctors
and pharmacists are helping to build a strong public health care service  in
difficult circumstances, but that is in fact what is happening. It was  your
organisation, hon mumbler on my left, that actually  opposed  the  issue  of
community health service. They are doing fantastic work, Minister, and  they
are helping to provide quality care. And once again, the  prophets  of  doom
were proved wrong.

I wonder if members of this House are aware of what the DA actually said  in
the hearings that the chairperson of the  portfolio  committee  referred  to
and this is typical DA-speak. They said, ``While the principle of  levelling
the playing fields is understood, the manner in which it is being  done''  -
and they are referring now to the certificate of need - ``restricts  freedom
of economic activity,  stifles  free  competition'',  and  listen  to  this,
``smacks of the old Group Areas Act which controlled where groups of  people
could stay and trade''. Do we  really  think  that  the  DA  has  the  moral
justification to talk about the Group Areas Act?  Do  we  really  think  so?
[Interjections.]

And then they go on to  say  the  following:  ``The  reality  is  that  most
patients go to a practitioner of their  choice.''  Do  they  live  in  South
Africa? Do most patients go to a practitioner of their choice? Not  at  all.
``Most of you sitting here also do that. It is the right of the consumer  to
choose the  service  provider  and  the  certificate  of  need  erodes  that
choice.'' Now the reality is that, for a period of  two  years,  no  medical
practitioner is going to have to apply for a certificate of need.  So  first
... die bangmaakstorie van die DA, wat s√™ dat mense se reg om 'n  dokter  te
word, gaan weggevat word, is 'n klomp nonsens. [... the  DA's  scary  story,
that the right of people to become doctors is going to be taken  away  is  a
lot of nonsense.]

It is actually rubbish. What they are  trying  to  do  is  to  create  scare
tactics. Do you know, I want to inform the House about this  as  well,  that
under the DA in this province, when all  provinces  had  an  opportunity  to
send South African medical students from the rural areas to  study  in  Cuba
and when they had the opportunity to bring Cuban doctors  in,  do  you  know
that for some bizarre, ideological reason, the DA opposed that? So now  when
we need doctors in Tulbagh and Touwsrivier,  there  are  no  rural  students
training in Cuba like those from the other provinces, and that is thanks  to
the DA. No wonder they are being rejected by the people of the Western  Cape
by the day! [Interjections.]

I am very happy, Minister, I am very happy, that we  have  clear  provisions
around  local  government,  that  there  is  a  definition  about  what  the
provinces should do, there is a definition about what local governments  can
do. But I would like our Minister to note what is happening in  one  or  two
local authorities that are still controlled by the DA in this province.  The
national department and Treasury have asked local  authorities  to  maintain
the primary health care funding until the  new  arrangement  kicks  in  next
year. Do you know that there are some local  authorities  in  Robertson  and
George that are threatening to pull the plug on primary health care  funding
now? They do not care. I think that is correct.

I am also very, very happy that in clause 22 of this Bill, in terms  of  the
National Health Council, provision is made for the military to  be  part  of
that because, through the Chair to the Minister, in  our  province  we  have
many big military hospitals -  Saldanha  and  there  are  others  -  and  we
believe that if there could be a rational approach as to how these  military
hospitals  could  actually  complement  the  health  care  services  in  our
province, this would be a major boost for the public health care system  and
I believe that  the  provisions  of  this  Bill,  when  it  is  passed,  are
definitely good.
So, to conclude, it is obviously with a sense  of  disappointment  that  the
coalition partner in the Western Cape, that is the New NP,  because  of  one
particular concern, decided that we could not take a position  and  that  is
why the Western Cape, on this particular Bill, is abstaining. But, from  the
ANC point of view, we are confident that this legislation  will  contribute.
And I also want to say that the DA might now want to say: "Oh, you  see  the
ANC and the New NP are now fighting." [Time expired.]

Dr G M RAMOKGOPA (Gauteng): Thank you, Mr Chairperson. The Gauteng  province
votes in favour of the National Health Bill  subject  to  the  understanding
that when the Minister exercises her  powers  under  clause  93(3)  for  the
transition period, she will have due regard to the national implications  of
the delivery of municipal health services, for  Gauteng  and  also  for  the
country at large.

It is important to note that the implications of  taking  this  matter  into
account specifically will result  in  protecting  the  primary  health  care
services in our country from losing about a billion rands. For  the  Gauteng
province, this amount is estimated  at  half  a  billion  rands,  which  the
province would otherwise be unable to raise.

We also take note and support the Minister in  her  undertaking  that,  when
specific provisions of the Bill or the Act then are implemented,  this  will
be done in a phased-in manner to enable provinces,  municipalities  and  the
national Ministry to  put  systems  in  place  to  make  sure  that  we  are
effectively  implementing  the  provisions  of  the  Bill.  Guided  by   the
constitutional rights to have access to health care  services  and  that  no
one should  be  denied  emergency  treatment,  the  ANC-led  Government  has
ensured the progressive realisation of these rights by our citizens.

The Bill under discussion today should enable us to build  on  the  progress
that we have made. As has been said, the Bill has undergone  several  drafts
from the first term  of  the  democratic  dispensation  to  date.  This  has
eventually allowed us to have an instrument  that  will  ensure  that  every
citizen has recourse in the law, not only in policies and  the  Constitution
but  also  in  legislation   that   provides   for   public,   private   and
nongovernmental health care services. Regardless of  whether  a  citizen  is
serviced by the public or  private  sector  or  the  nongovernmental  health
service provider, their rights will be protected.

Health is a conditionality for sustainable development.  Health  is  a  very
important element when we consider the investment in human capital  for  our
economy to grow in a sustainable way. Health is an  essential  component  of
an integrated approach to intercept the cycle of poverty and to protect  the
human rights including those of children, women, the disabled, the  elderly,
workers and society in general.

As we move towards the celebration of 10 years of our  democracy,  the  Bill
enables us to build on the implementation of policies  and  programmes  that
have  enabled  us,  firstly,  to  improve  access  to  health  services   by
deliberately focusing on building new clinics and improving the  quality  of
services at primary care level.

I just want to share with the House that in 1994 over one  million  patients
visited our clinics in Gauteng. In 1997, four million  patient  visits  were
experienced and, last year,  these  had  increased  to  10  million  patient
visits per annum.  More  and  more  of  our  children  now  have  access  to
immunisation services,  pregnant  mothers  have  access  to  antenatal  care
services, patients with chronic illnesses can also now attend local  clinics
and do not have to travel long distances  to  queue  in  hospitals  together
with those who are acutely sick.

The Bill also allows us  to  strengthen  the  management  of  hospitals,  in
particular ensuring that there is compliance with norms  and  standards  for
quality care and also for the management of available resources  in  a  more
accountable way through effective  and  efficient  systems.  The  Bill  also
ensures that we have South African trained and registered professionals  who
would meet the health care needs of our people throughout the country.
Of particular importance in this Bill is the attention it  gives  to  health
care service users. An independent social audit commissioned by the  Gauteng
province revealed that whilst 50% of the general public were satisfied  with
the improvements made in the public health  services,  for  those  who  used
services in the last 12 months of the audit  in  Gauteng,  the  satisfaction
level was at 80%.

Whilst we strive to ensure  that  all  service  users,  100%  of  them,  are
satisfied with the improvements, the results show  the  positive  impact  of
the Batho Pele policies, the patients rights  charter,  the  service  pledge
signed by managers and professionals and support  staff,  the  accreditation
programme and other quality assurance  initiatives  that  were  designed  to
protect the rights of service users.

This is despite the increase in patient numbers and the 20% increase in  the
population sites in the province between  the  two  previous  censuses.  The
Bill now makes it compulsory that norms  and  standards  are  developed  and
that systems are put in place to ensure compliance and that all  people  who
use our services are assured of recourse should they not be satisfied.

As the Minister has outlined, the Bill will enable the  country  to  advance
in the transformation of health services, to ensure that there is  equitable
access and distribution  of  health  services  and  health  human  resources
between  and  within  provinces.  It  will  ensure  a  seamless,  integrated
national health care system and do away with the  fragmentation,  especially
at local level, and entrench the rights of citizens to quality  health  care
whether provided by the public or private sector or even by  nongovernmental
health care providers.

The Bill will also enable us  to  advance  with  respect  to  outlining  the
rights and responsibilities of health workers and to ensure that  norms  and
standards are developed and monitored. This will enable us to  send  a  very
clear message that the  issues  of  workloads  and  creating  positive  work
environments are addressed in order to send a clear message  that  we  value
our health workers just as much as we expect them to  provide  high  quality
care at all times.

South Africa is not getting optimal value for the resources that  it  spends
in the health sector, both public and private, put together.  This  is  also
of great concern because the trend is that more and  more  of  our  citizens
are utilising public health services whilst the private sector  looks  after
less and less citizens, but uses more and more health resources.

We acknowledge that  a  number  of  provisions  in  the  Act  with  specific
reference  to  health  establishments,  the  certificate  of  need  and  the
introduction of the inspectorate will be implemented in a phased-in  manner,
but we certainly welcome the need to make sure  that  these  resources  that
are also utilised in the private sector are used for the optimal benefit  of
the country and also  of  the  workers  and  employers  that  contribute  to
private health insurance.

It is also  important  to  highlight  that  the  promotion  of  co-operative
government between  all  three  spheres  of  Government  is  entrenched  and
clearly outlined as the community participation structures  that  have  been
established through the various councils and at district level  through  the
clinic committees and the district health councils. The  Bill  also  enables
us to have a vision of a common South Africa with a single health system,  a
seamless health care system that ensures that wherever the citizens  in  our
country find themselves, they are assured of good quality health care.

With those few words, I would like to thank the Minister for the  leadership
that she has provided, the chairpersons of both the  National  Assembly  and
the NCOP for the  work  that  they  have  done  in  consultations  and  also
acknowledge the inputs of my colleagues  as  well  as  the  members  of  the
National Assembly, the province, and the NCOP in various provinces as  well.
I also express my thanks for the inputs  that  have  been  made  by  various
stakeholders because, indeed,  this  is  watershed  legislation  that  would
advance us in terms of strengthening the health services.

I just want to also indicate that I have discussed the issue of the  concern
around primary health care resources and that it is  a  shared  concern  and
that we need to look at mechanisms to make sure  that  primary  health  care
expenditure is protected in the implementation  of  this  Bill.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members, I'm  going  to
deliver this speech on behalf of my MEC who couldn't make  it  at  the  last
minute because of some emergencies.

The national Department  of  Health,  in  this  Bill,  is  implementing  its
constitutional right to restore  and  ensure  that  our  people  live  in  a
dignified manner, and also promote healthy  lifestyles.  The  reason  why  I
assert that this is a human rights issue is  based  on  the  fact  that  the
objectives clearly attempt to realise that  effort,  an  effort  of  setting
standards that will uphold the rights and duties of health  care  providers,
health care workers, which was not the norm before,  and  also  that  health
institutions and the users of health  services  must  respect,  promote  and
fulfil that national obligation, and the  desire  to  progressively  realise
the importance of access to health  care  services,  including  reproductive
health care.

It is vocal on the rights of patients and of health workers. The  Bill  also
aims to create an enabling environment that is nonharmful to the  health  or
wellbeing of the citizenry, where no chance would be  allowed  for  purposes
of research to violate the rights of others to be used as guinea  pigs.  Our
children's rights, especially to  basic  nutrition  and  basic  health  care
services, should be prioritised. Hon Chair, the ball is now in our court  to
make sure that the dreams of our people are realised and put  into  concrete
action.

The issues contained in Chapter 2 struck my heart the most because it  deals
with the rights that I am asserting. This area is what will  make  or  break
us in regard to the social contract that we entered into  with  our  people,
the contract that binds and guides  our  mutual  understanding  and  working
relations towards the  achievement  of  access  to  affordable  health  care
services. History will judge us based on how we fare in this regard.

Key to all elements that would make us achieve health care services  is  the
responsibility and duty to disseminate  information,  the  information  that
would be binding to  the  national  and  provincial  departments  and  local
government  structures  in  ensuring   that   adequate   and   comprehensive
information  is  disseminated  on  health  care  services  for  which   each
organisation is responsible to our communities.

The obligation to keep safe  health  records,  adherence  to  the  right  to
confidentiality and laying of  complaints  by  would-be  aggrieved  parties,
just to mention a few observations, will win the hearts of our  communities.
It will also create trust between Government and its citizenry.

It gives me great pleasure to be part of this debate and to give  my  inputs
in the formation of the National Health Bill of 2002. Never in  the  history
of South Africa will things be the same again,  especially  in  relation  to
the promotion and adherence to the rights of our  people  who  come  from  a
bitter history of denial and segregation. Our people  deserve  the  best  of
all in service provision and I think that this  Bill  attempts  to  do  just
that.

Gone are the Darwinian eras, where the  survival  of  the  fittest  was  the
norm. Our era requires that we do things in a civilised manner where  things
are  put  in  black  and  white  for  the  purposes  of   transparency   and
accountability, as democracy requires. The purpose and the intention of  the
proposer of the Bill, in this case the policy-maker,  should  be  clear  and
understandable to  everyone.  We  are  gathered  here  to  debate  on  those
pertinent issues and to understand the intention of the Bill as proposed  by
the National Minister, Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang.

My humble understanding of the object of the Bill  is  that  it  strives  to
improve health care services by regulating and setting standards that  would
be uniform to all.  These  will  include  the  public  and  private  service
providers throughout the country in the  best  interest  of  the  people  of
South Africa, for them to get value for money spent and the  utilisation  of
scarce resources.

Access to health care services is key  to  the  sustainable  development  of
this country for economic, social and political growth, hence the  right  to
health care services, which is regarded as a human rights  issue  and  forms
part of the highest priority on the national agenda. My point of entry  into
today's debate would focus on the strengthening, observance and  inculcation
of the culture of human rights agenda  in  an  inclusive  manner  to  health
development in the 21st century. This would also encourage the principle  of
Batho Pele in our quest to promote participatory  democracy  in  as  far  as
health care services are concerned.  It  would  also  be  strengthening  the
understanding between patients and health providers  in  the  observance  of
matters affecting their health status and making choices on  decisions  they
would be making.

Chapters 3, 4 and 5 have come out clearly on the guidelines  in  as  far  as
roles are concerned of all spheres of government health institutions  within
the national, provincial and district health councils. They also attempt  to
further strengthen issues of integrated approach  and  the  provision  of  a
basket full of services  to  our  communities.  Issues  contained  in  these
chapters, especially on the establishment of  the  national  and  provincial
health councils and health committees  will  be  of  great  benefit  to  the
political head of the Government to draw broader  expertise  from  different
health workers and also to encompass the needs of communities  who  will  be
represented in one way or the other in these forums.

The responsibility of handling of classification  of  health  establishments
through political heads at both national and provincial  level  demonstrates
the political will to address  the  imbalances  of  the  past  in  terms  of
equity, location, size and the nature of levels of health care  services  to
the communities as per their geographic location and the demographic  reach.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr E NOE (Free State): Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  members  of  the
NCOP, colleagues from other provinces, ladies  and  gentlemen,  we  rise  in
support of the Bill, because we believe that the Bill brings about  new  and
fundamental changes to the health service delivery process, as  outlined  in
the long title and the preamble to the Bill.

I'd just like to mention a few of these changes in that, firstly,  the  Bill
provides for  the  fulfilment  of  the  constitutional  obligations  of  the
Government with regard to  the  rights  relating  to  health  care  services
within the available resources; secondly, it provides for the regulation  of
the national health system and provides for uniformity in respect of  health
services by establishing a  national  health  system  for  both  public  and
private providers of health services; and, thirdly, it sets out  the  rights
and duties of health care providers, health workers,  health  establishments
and users. These are critical values that need to be  supported  by  all  of
us, and there is no question about the fact  that  this  Bill  is  aimed  at
ensuring that these values permeate our society.

Allow me to briefly reflect on some of the specific elements  of  the  Bill,
which we are in support of, and to identify what we consider still to  be  a
limitation. We support this Bill. Firstly,  the  issue  of  certificates  of
need has already been referred to, and we will hammer this point home  until
those who are opposed to this provision agree to it. The opposition  parties
are vehemently opposed to this provision of the certificates of need,  which
is one of the critical positives in this  Bill  in  terms  of  our  bringing
about the fundamental changes I have spoken of.

There is no question about the fact that our society has inequitable  access
to health services, owing to the concentration of private hospital beds  and
technology in urban areas. The process  of  registration  will  thus  ensure
that we rid our society  of  bogus  medical  practitioners.  Moreover,  this
process is also aimed at ensuring equity in our  society  in  terms  of  the
distribution of medical doctors in  our  communities.  Surely  there  is  no
point in having 10 doctors concentrated  in  one  small  area,  while  other
areas do not have a single medical doctor? The  distribution  of  skills  in
communities is something that needs to be enhanced.

Secondly, the issue of the uniformity of  health  services  is  a  necessity
that cannot be avoided at this stage. The Bill encourages this  by  ensuring
that co-operative governance becomes the order of  the  day.  I  must  state
that for us in the Free State the Bill  comes  at  a  most  opportune  time,
since we have already moved miles towards the goal of making sure  that  our
municipalities are ready for the devolution  of  health  services  to  them.
Several interactions between the province and  municipalities  have  already
taken place towards this goal.

Thirdly, as the Free State province we are also happy  about  clause  19  of
the Bill. Through this clause the Bill encourages and promotes the issue  of
voluntary testing so that individuals are able to take  complete  charge  of
their  health.  It  thus  promotes  the  spirit   of   self-reliance   among
individuals and communities when it comes to their health status.  While  we
are faced with the pandemic of HIV/Aids,  this  clarion  call  of  voluntary
testing, as contained in this Bill, is a noble idea.

Regarding this issue of voluntary testing, before I came into this  House  I
was approached by one of our members who said to me that I must say that  he
read in one of the health journals that in Zambia  while  some  people  have
been calling for the introduction of antiretrovirals,  having  succeeded  in
amassing their services, other people who have  been  at  the  forefront  of
calling for these services are now pushing from the back. They  are  running
away from testing, because  you  cannot  be  provided  with  antiretrovirals
unless we know your status. We hope that  in  this  country  those  who  are
vocal, whilst the department and Government ready  themselves  to  roll  out
antiretrovirals, will be at the forefront of testing.

However, it must be further emphasised  here  that  individuals  are  called
upon to take full charge of their health. There are many  other  conditions,
such as tuberculosis, high blood pressure and so on  that  individuals  need
to test for and about which they need to know their status so that they  can
deal with them. Thus, we support the Bill in this regard.

Allow me, further, to point out that we are also  happy  as  a  province  to
support this Bill in relation to clauses 22, 24, 26  and  28,  because  they
relate to the critical issue of community participation  in  health  matters
as we know  that  South  Africans  complain  too  much  about  consultation.
Through  these  clauses  the  Bill  promotes  the  direct  involvement   and
participation of communities in health issues through the  establishment  of
the national and provincial health councils. The purpose of  these  councils
will be to interface with communities on a constant  basis  and  advise  the
Minister or the MEC for health accordingly.

There is no question that if we are  to  succeed  in  terms  of  quality  in
health service delivery, we need to take the ordinary people along  with  us
in the planning and implementation of plans. These  are  just  some  of  the
many points in this Bill that we want to communicate our support around.

There is one issue of limitation which  we  think  has  not  been  taken  on
board, as we proposed amendments. There is a limitation  as  far  as  clause
41(7)(c) is concerned, which reflects on the composition of hospital  boards
and states that a provincial representative has to be appointed in  each  of
the hospital boards in the hospitals within the province.

We believe that this creates an unnecessary burden  on  the  MECs.  We  also
believe that departmental officials within  the  districts,  or  within  the
hospitals themselves, already represent the provincial department  and  thus
their presence on the boards is sufficient. We also  want  to  propose  that
the concept of provincial representatives be  revisited  as  it  may  create
confusion.

In conclusion, I want to reiterate that this Bill  is  indeed  breaking  new
ground in terms of health service delivery. The points  in  support  of  the
Bill far outweigh the limitations that we have pointed  out.  Overall,  this
Bill needs to be endorsed and we do so as the Free  State.  Thank  you  very
much, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Deputy Chair, hon Minister, colleagues, spare me a  minute  as
I just want to thank the  hon  Dugmore  who,  instead  of  speaking  on  the
National  Health  Bill,  decided  to  focus  on  the  DA.  Thanks  for   the
advertisement. What a bonus. The country will take  notice  of  that.  Thank
you very much. [Interjections.]

We  all  acknowledge  the  fact  that  the  health  services  pre-1994  were
unbalanced, inequitable and unjust,  both  socially  and  economically,  and
that a Bill  which  addresses  these  issues  would  be  very  welcome.  The
objectives of the National Health Bill are to  provide  a  framework  for  a
structured and uniform health system which  will  redress  these  injustices
and imbalances of the past. The reality, however, is that  this  Bill  fails
to meet the intended  objectives.  [Interjections.]  It  lacks  measures  to
address past and existing inequities and gives the Minister too much  power.
It appears that there is a need and purpose on the part  of  the  Government
to regulate the private industry. The areas of greatest concern are  clauses
41 to 45 which deal with the certificates of need.

In their reaction to this Bill, the SA Medical Association broadly  supports
accreditation  systems  and   the   incentivisation   ...   [Interjections.]
Chairperson, please! The association broadly supports accreditation  systems
and the incentivisation of doctors to establish practices so as  to  address
health care needs in underserviced communities.

They have serious concerns, however, regarding  the  certificates  of  need.
Accreditation systems and the certificates of need have to be balanced  with
the existing rights of doctors, and must  be  practicable  and  economically
viable.  The  doctors  of  South  Africa  will  need  assurances  that   the
regulations  relating  to  the  certificates  of  need  are  drawn   up   in
consultation with the stakeholders.

The only existing avenue  of  appeal  if  the  director-general  refuses  an
application for, or withdraws a certificate of need, is to the  Minister  of
Health. This makes the Minister both referee and player in this game. It  is
unacceptable. [Interjections.] The introduction of the certificates of  need
violates the free-market principles of  supply  and  demand.  We  must  take
cognisance of the fact that the SA  Medical  Association  supports  sensible
and open public-private partnerships.

If we look at our Bill of Rights, we find the following  in  section  22  on
freedom of trade, occupation and profession. I quote:  ``Every  citizen  has
the right  to  choose  their  trade,  occupation  and  profession  freely.''
[Interjections.] Section 36 of this Bill strikes at the heart of this  right
of medical practitioners to choose their profession freely. It  prohibits  a
person from  establishing  health  establishments,  such  as  hospitals  and
surgeries, without a certificate of need, which is to be obtained  from  the
director-general  in  terms  of  regulations.  The  fact  that  no   minimum
standards or required qualifications are stated is  unacceptable.  The  only
judge for the necessity of a practice is the director-general.  This  is  an
infringement of the basic freedom to work enshrined in our Constitution.

It is regrettable that there  is  a  certificate  of  need.  It  is  a  most
inappropriate regulatory measure and is certainly going  to  accelerate  the
exit of highly competent and qualified health care professionals from  South
Africa. We must rather give reason to our skilled workers and  professionals
to be loyal to their country than place obstacles in the road.  Certificates
of need antagonise competent and qualified health  care  professionals.  The
country can ill afford this. My party cannot support this Bill.  Thank  you.
[Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Order!

Mr A T  MANYOSI  (Eastern  Cape):  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon
members of the NCOP, and hon special delegates, firstly,  I  must  apologise
on behalf of the MEC for Health in the Eastern Cape. He is not  able  to  be
here  -  although  he  intended  to  be  here  -  because  he  has  had  two
bereavements at his home. However, I am representing the standing  committee
on health from the Eastern Cape.

To the province of the Eastern Cape, the National Health  Bill  comes  as  a
remedy for a multitude of social ills of the past dispensation, as  much  of
the land constituting  the  province  was  a  testing  ground  for  all  the
practices  envisaged  to  achieve  separate  development.  Those   practices
affected all aspects of the lives of our people, including health  services.
It may be of relevance to quote from the TRC's final report where it says:


  Those who benefited, and are still benefiting, from a range  of  unearned
  privileges under apartheid have a crucial role to play. This means that a
  great  deal  of  attention  must  be  given  to  an  altered   sense   of
  responsibility, namely the duty of obligation of those who have benefited
  so much through racially privileged education,  unfair  access  to  land,
  business opportunities and so on, to contribute to the present and future
  reconstruction of our society.

Health services have not been  uncontaminated  by  the  system  of  racially
based allocation of services, especially in the Eastern Cape. In a  province
where the concentration of advanced health services has been  in  towns  and
cities, the provision of a framework  for  a  structured  health  system  or
regulation of health services that  takes  into  account  the  socioeconomic
injustices, imbalances, and inequities of health services of  the  past  and
recognises the need to improve the quality of the  lives  of  all  citizens,
brings a sigh  of  relief  to  all  our  people,  including  the  previously
disadvantaged.

The Bill provides for a certificate of need as a  requirement,  inter  alia,
to address the problem of  the  concentration  of  health  services  in  one
section of society to the disadvantage or exclusion of others, as  had  been
the case in the past, a situation that  has  continued  to  resist  remedial
interventions by Government thus far. This may be  negatively  construed  to
be inhibiting the rights of  individual  health  practitioners  to  exercise
their professions where they like, but that right should  never  be  allowed
to undermine the rights of the rest of society.

In fact, it is  actually  intended  to  ensure  co-operation  and  a  shared
responsibility among public and private health  professionals,  a  condition
without which we cannot successfully address  the  backlogs  that  remain  a
challenge for all of  us.  The  system  of  licensing  will  facilitate  the
decentralisation of health services, especially in  provinces  where  health
professionals are scarce.

May I mention that in our standing  committee  we  have  all  the  political
parties, including the political party that is represented by  the  hon  Mrs
Gouws. We decided that, despite constraints of  time,  we  would  give  them
enough time to express their views. They expressed their  views,  and  after
reaching a stage where they could no longer  bring  new  points  we  reached
consensus.

Without going into detail about the provisions  of  the  Bill,  the  Eastern
Cape province  supports  the  adoption  of  the  National  Health  Bill,  as
amended. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Deputy Chairperson and hon Minister, the ANC,  which  is  the
majority party and also the ruling party, believes that the  provisions  for
a certificate of need in this National Health Bill  are  well  thought  out,
comprehensive and well balanced. At the same time it will  promote  improved
access and utilisation of health services, as  well  as  encourage  improved
quality of care. I would like to emphasise this  point  in  Chapter  6.  The
members have been repeating it.  We  want  to  stress  this  point  so  that
despite the perception that has been  created  outside  by  the  opposition,
people should realise there is nothing to fear.

Unlike some opposition parties we do not believe that it  is  a  dompas  for
doctors, health care professionals and  those  providing  good  health  care
facilities.  In  fact,  to  make  such  a  comparison  is  not  only  highly
insensitive to those  comrades  who  suffered  exceptional  degradation  and
humiliation  under  the   inhumane   dompas   system,   but   also   grossly
misrepresents the certificate of need in its totality.

There are certain basic requirements to  be  met  in  order  to  obtain  the
certificate of need. The director-general tasked with issuing a  certificate
of need will have to take into account, amongst other factors, the  need  to
promote an equitable distribution and  rationalisation  of  health  services
and health care resources, and the need to correct the inequities  based  on
racial, gender, economic and geographical factors.

When the Minister introduced the debate, she touched on some of the  points.
In an effort to overcome the disparities which we have  inherited  from  our
apartheid past, also built into the certificate of need application  process
is a mechanism to stop any kind of abuse  that  may  emanate  from  the  DG,
namely, an appeal process directed to the Minister against any  decision  to
grant a certificate  of  need.  Therefore,  it  is  extremely  difficult  to
understand why any of the above provisions, and those provisions set out  in
Chapter 6 of the Bill, could be thought to be unfair in any way and  to  any
particular group.

Clearly health services and health providers have to be  regulated  in  some
way or another. In the absence of such a legal framework and guidelines,  as
has been the case till  now,  we  would  have  a  poor  quality  of  service
provision, overservicing and wastage of scarce and precious resources.

We are also not claiming that this regulatory measure  is  unique  to  South
Africa. Indeed, we are in very good company with most  of  the  first  world
nations who believe that there should be appropriate  regulation  of  health
services  and  health  care   providers.   Registration   of   health   care
professionals  and  placement  of  health  facilities,   the   international
equivalent of the certificate of need, occur  in  virtually  all  countries,
such as Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, the  Unites  States,  Germany
and most European countries. Their  requirements  are  even  more  stringent
that those proposed in our National Health Bill.

In South Africa currently, health professionals have an  effective  monopoly
in a number of  areas.  Among  these  health  professional  groups,  pricing
levels are set, competition is not allowed, marketing  and  advertising  are
not allowed, and entry into the  profession  is  strictly  controlled.  Very
often what happens in an unregulated monopoly is that levels  of  efficiency
and quality of care are likely to drop  as  there  is  little  incentive  to
maintain these.

Even users of the health care services are disadvantaged by  an  unregulated
service in a number of ways. Users, especially the poor and  vulnerable,  do
not have sufficient information to decide  on  the  types  of  service  they
require. This could lead to the level of  servicing  being  decided  by  the
health professional alone.

In the private sector especially,  this  could  lead  to  overservicing.  In
other words, you may be charged for a service that  is  not  vital  to  your
continued good health. This  is  more  likely  to  occur  when  many  health
professionals provide a service to a small number of people. Therefore,  the
ratio of health care professionals to populations should be controlled.

An unregulated health service would tend to perpetuate gross  inequities  in
the geographical location  of  services.  Most  health  professionals  would
prefer to practise in urban and wealthy areas,  with  very  few  willing  to
operate in peri-urban and rural areas. This would mean that  the  population
living  in  the  peri-urban  and  rural  areas,  where  there  are  critical
shortages, would have much less access to health services.

Over and above the other argument outlined, the ANC  feels  that  the  state
has  paid  for  the  major  cost  of  training  health  professionals   and,
therefore, should have  some  ability  to  intervene  should  the  situation
warrant it. It is at this juncture in our transformation process that  there
is a need to provide a mechanism to achieve equity  and  efficiency  in  the
deployment of health professionals  and  safeguard  standards  in  order  to
ensure a reasonable quality of care to our people. So, we  make  no  apology
for the inclusion of the certificate of need.

The recent Sars outbreak and our continuous battle with cholera and  malaria
make it imperative that health service provision throughout the  country  is
regulated and co-ordinated to meet the needs, not only  of  the  individual,
but also of the larger community. To this end, regulation  is  essential  as
the unregulated market is simply incapable of providing for group  needs  on
such a large scale.

The ANC considers it a dereliction of duty if this Ministry should  fail  to
institute effective, efficient and equitable regulation for  health  service
provision. The conditions to be met to obtain and  renew  a  certificate  of
need, as laid out in the National Health Bill, effectively, efficiently  and
equitably address the health service regulation duties  of  the  Government.
The ANC is, therefore, convinced that the certificate on  need  is  a  vital
component of the National Health Bill. [Applause.]

Dr  P   J   C   NEL:   Agb   Voorsitter,   agb   Minister,   die   Nasionale
Gesondheidswetsontwerp het 'n baie lang aanloop  gehad  en  ook  nie  sonder
moeite nie. Daar is  in  die  parlement√™re  proses  alleen  byvoorbeeld  115
wysigings aangebring deur die portefeuljekomitee en 'n verdere 24  deur  die
gekose komitee. Dit alles ten spyt, selfs al die wysigings aan klousule  36,
maak dit nie vir die Nuwe NP moontlik om vir die wetsontwerp  te  stem  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, the National Health  Bill  has
had a very long  run-up,  and  was  not  without  difficulties  either.  For
instance, in the  parliamentary  process  alone  115  amendments  have  been
effected by  the  portfolio  committee  and  a  further  24  by  the  select
committee. Despite all of this, even all the amendments to clause 36, it  is
not possible for the New NP to vote in favour of the Bill.]

The New NP supports most of the measures and structures as proposed  in  the
Bill that we believe will assist the Department of Health in its attempt  to
implement a health system in South Africa  of  acceptable  quality  for  all
South Africans. The New NP is fully aware of the dilemma in  which  the  hon
Minister finds herself as far as the delivery  of  health  services  in  the
rural areas is concerned and that something has to  be  done  to  solve  the
problem.

The New NP is, however, of  the  opinion  that  the  implementation  of  the
certificate of need  will  not  assist  in  solving  this  problem.  We  are
actually of the opinion that it will have the opposite effect.  The  New  NP
has recently done some research on  the  use  of  the  certificate  of  need
programmes in other countries. Available resources consulted had  little  or
no information on whether the certificate  of  need  is  used  in  countries
outside the  United  States  of  America,  although  the  hon  Minister  has
mentioned a few today.

The use of the certificate of need was established in the USA  as  far  back
as the early 1970s. The primary purpose was to reduce the  record  increases
in health care  costs.  Since  1986,  11  states  have  repealed  their  CON
programmes.  However,  a  number  of  states  are  still  implementing   the
certificate of need  programme,  but  it  applies  mainly  to  major  health
establishments and tertiary services - not to individuals.

The New NP is  also  deeply  concerned  about  the  brain  drain  of  health
workers. A spokesman of the Young Doctors' Association recently said, and  I
quote from the article in The Argus of 22 September:


  As many as 60% to 70% of my friends in  other  medical  sectors  plan  to
  emigrate. Another 20% will stay to specialise and  then  they  will  also
  leave. The majority of the rest will immigrate internally to the  private
  sector.

The South African Registrars'  Association  (Sara)  representing  the  young
specialising doctors, stated recently that the levels  of  frustration  felt
by doctors, nurses and other health providers because of major  problems  in
the public sector at all levels, are almost unquantifiable.

The public sector as a career option is therefore dwindling  in  popularity.
Though private practice is another career option the spectre of the CON  has
cast huge doubts over this sector. The  only  option  left  for  many  young
doctors is to leave the country.

The New NP is of the opinion that the main reasons  health  workers  in  the
public  service  are  looking  for  greener  pastures  are:   Poor   working
conditions, poor living conditions, lack of security at work, poor  salaries
and a lack of incentives. The New NP  is  in  favour  of  and  supports  the
incentive to the amount of R500 million announced and earmarked by  the  hon
Minister for the improvement of these conditions.  The  New  NP  is  of  the
opinion that increasing this amount annually  and  applying  this  programme
promptly and correctly would be a better option to solve this problem.

In the light of all the points I have made in respect of the certificate  of
need I would like, on behalf of the New NP and  on  behalf  of  many  people
outside of this Chamber, to appeal to the Minister to amend  this  provision
and look again at the whole concept of the certificate of need,  the  merits
of which are in serious dispute and contention. It is not too  late  to  get
rid of this source of unnecessary contention and division.

What we need now is a  common  effort,  a  collective  will  to  tackle  the
enormous challenges which we face as  we  work  to  bring  health  care,  of
acceptable quality, to all South Africans. That is what the  New  NP  wishes
to see in our country and we will continue to  work  hard  to  achieve  this
aim. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S W MCOYI (KwaZulu-Natal): Hon  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon
members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here,  not
just because it is the first time that I am here, but because I am  bringing
a statement of wellness from our tranquil KwaZulu-Natal. [Applause.]

We find that this Bill has its roots in the Constitution of our country,  so
there was no way of doing otherwise. The Constitution  says  that  everybody
must have access to health care. All branches that come up on the stem  come
from the roots of our Constitution.

Chapter 1 of the Bill outlines the objectives of the  Bill,  the  issues  it
seeks to address and how these are to be addressed. The Ministry  of  Health
is established as the responsible body for  the  provision  of  health  care
services to users. The oversight  functions  rest  with  the  Minister.  The
responsibility for health care provision is also vested  in  the  provincial
and municipal structures, which gives expression to  the  principle  of  co-
operative governance.

This chapter goes on to set out criteria for the eligibility of health  care
services in public health establishments. The Government's intention  is  to
adhere to the provision of  social  rights,  which  includes  the  right  to
health care.  This  right  is  inclusive  of  both  health  care  users  and
providers.

Chapter 2  of  the  Bill  expresses  and  outlines  the  commitment  to  the
realisation of the rights and duties of users  and  health  care  personnel.
The rights reflected in this chapter range from  the  rights  to  access  to
emergency treatment, to full knowledge  of  the  medical  condition  by  the
user, the consent of the user to any medical treatment to  be  administered,
thus resulting in participatory decision-making.

In this way, a user  is  likely  to  feel  safe  in  receiving  health  care
treatment when he or she is part of the decision-making  concerning  his  or
her health. This chapter encourages transparency and calls for  health  care
providers and users to deal  with  one  another  in  good  faith  where  all
parties have access to information.

Chapter  3  outlines  the  responsibilities  of  the  national   sphere   of
Government in terms of health  services.  The  different  functions  of  the
national department are set out. These duties are mostly related  to  policy
development  and  oversight  to  ensure  implementation,   and   to   ensure
compliance with the national health policy provisions.

This Bill calls for the establishment of the  National  Health  Council.  In
this body the health MECs, Ministers, organised local governments and  other
stakeholders will meet to discuss matters of common  interest.  The  chapter
outlines the duties of the council and its powers.

Chapter 4 focuses on the provincial spheres of government  with  regards  to
health. This chapter places  an  obligation  on  provincial  departments  to
comply with  the  provisions  of  the  national  health  policy.  Provincial
departments are called  upon  to  act  on  these  provisions  and  implement
principles of the national policy at provincial level.  This  responsibility
brings with it financial implications. The Bill calls for the  establishment
of the Provincial Health  Council  whose  function  is  oversight  over  the
implementation √ø.√ø.√ø. [Time expired.]

Mrs V TAMBO (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon members,  Minister  of  Health
and hon members of the NCOP, it is with great  satisfaction  and  fulfilment
that today I stand here representing my province KZN. KZN is indeed in  full
support of the Bill and its amendments of  which  the  intentions  are  very
clear in terms of the balances and inequities  of  health  services  of  the
past and there's more room for  improvement.  Indeed  a  structured  uniform
health system within the country was long overdue and finally the  team  has
assembled what is best for the  citizens  of  RSA.  Congratulations  to  all
involved: We are proud of you. KwaZulu-Natal, the  most  populated  province
of all, fully supports the Bill and its population stands  to  benefit  with
the rest of the provinces.

This department has transformed through its consistent revision of  policies
and legislation  in  a  way  never  seen  before  in  the  history  of  this
department which used to be obscure during those days when it only  serviced
the so-called first class citizens. The enormous good work done by the  team
in fine-polishing the amendments and the research put in, in order  to  make
sure that the Bill complies and is also user-friendly and  simple  has  also
been taken into consideration.

This marvellous job is in line with the commitment of the department,  which
has always had the ordinary John Citizen in mind when making  any  piece  of
legislation. Therefore any tool, any piece of legislation, that is  designed
to make it function more effectively or make life better  for  all  must  be
welcomed. The Bill's pieces of legislation that are being  proposed  by  the
ANC-led Government turn our resolutions into  solutions.  They  are  action-
packed and really bring prosperity through mobility.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chairperson, hon members and  hon  Minister,  the  Bill
under discussion seeks  to  create  uniformity  across  the  nation  in  the
delivery of health services by establishing norms and standards,  frameworks
and national policies.  In  other  words,  it  brings  about  transformation
across the board in health services. For that reason, a schedule of 12  Acts
enacted from as far back as 1977 until 1993  have  been  repealed  in  their
entirety and their functions and provisions are replaced by this  new  Bill.
I am constrained from delving into the details of the  Bill  owing  to  time
limitations and can only pick up the pieces in  order  to  comply  with  the
rulings of the House.

According to clause 5  of  the  Bill,  a  health  care  provider  or  health
establishment may not refuse a person emergency treatment. My province,  the
North West, and two others, the Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga, were  concerned
that the term ``emergency'' should have been defined so that all of  us  are
on the same wavelength regarding that term. However,  it  was  explained  by
the legal advisers of the department that the term was used as used  in  the
Constitution, and that defining  it  in  any  way  could  render  this  Bill
unconstitutional. Of course, we all accepted the explanation.

Another interesting provision of the Bill concerns the rights and duties  of
users relating to having full knowledge of their health status, the  consent
of users to medical treatment, participation in decisions that affect  them,
discharge reports and so on. These provisions are an indication that  health
issues are no longer a matter of ``it is good enough for  them'',  or  ``dit
is goed genoeg vir hulle'', but takes into account that we too  are  people.
That is ``le rona re batho'' in Setswana.

The UCDP supports this Bill. [Applause.]

investigate the case so that a decision can be taken in a fair manner.]

[Interjections.] Where were you? [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

The National Health Bill tries to accommodate  all  aspects  of  health  and
health-related matters.

Molaokakanyo wo, nepo kgolo ya wona e lego go sokolla mabosaedi ka  moka  ao
a hlotswego ke Mmuso wa maloba wa kgethologanyo  moo  molwetsi  ge  a  be  a
lwala, arego go kaone ke hwele ka mo ntlong ye, go phala gore ke ye  ngakeng
ke ye go tlaiswa ke dingaka le baoki. Tshwaro e mpe. (Translation of  Sepedi
paragraph follows.)
[This Bill aims to address all the wrongs caused by the  previous  apartheid
Government, for example, when a patient was  sick,  they  opted  to  die  at
home, instead of going to a medical doctor  to  be  abused  by  doctors  and
nurses. Very bad treatment.]

It also seeks to bring the Department of Health in line  with  the  national
health obligations contained in our Constitution. However,  I  believe  that
one of the most important features that this  National  Health  Bill  brings
about is the number of rights it gives  to  users  of  the  health  services
across the country. Not only does this piece of legislation  ensure  broadly
that every person using the service is treated  with  dignity  and  respect,
but it also puts a similar obligation on users to treat those  bringing  the
service to them, that is doctors, nurses, etc, with  the  same  dignity  and
respect. In fact, throughout Chapter 2 of this Bill the principles of  Batho
Pele are emphasised.

All of us can tell stories of our children, parents and  grandparents  going
to the hospitals, clinics or day hospitals in our neighbourhoods where  they
were either treated badly or treated only with respect, depending  on  where
they found themselves. It has  been  our  unfortunate  legacy  that  it  was
usually those who came from poor, disadvantaged and rural  backgrounds  that
found themselves at the receiving end of poor treatment. Those who  had  all
the advantages received  privileged  and  dignified  treatment.  Nurses  and
doctors, too, can relate stories of how they were verbally abused  and  even
had their lives threatened by patients using the facilities.

The apartheid era health system saw to it that patients were never  informed
of the benefits, risks, costs and  consequences  generally  associated  with
each option. Black people in general and those undereducated  in  particular
were disregarded in decision-making about  their  own  health.  People  were
treated like ignorant children.

With this Bill, our people are given  back  their  dignity.  They  have  the
right to refuse unnecessary health  procedures  or  medication.  Even  their
personal health status may now not be revealed without their  knowledge  and
approval. This  Bill  therefore  determines  the  policies  that  provide  a
framework of how users of health care facilities across the  country  should
be treated once they present themselves for treatment.

Another far-reaching measure that this chapter introduces is the concept  of
emergency treatment for all. This means that  no  health  care  provider  or
health establishment can refuse to give  anyone  emergency  treatment.  This
obliges even ambulances which  are  contracted  to  hospitals,  to  stop  to
provide treatment. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member. I was  starting
to panic, thinking that perhaps you would say, ``Where was I?'' [Laughter.]

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZEMPILO: Sihlalo,  angethembe  ukuthi  awuzukulibheka  iwashi

isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I just hope that you are not going  to
look at the clock because I will speak for quite some time. I appeal to  you
not to cut me short so that I can reply fully. It is also still early as  it
has just gone twenty minutes past four.]

Let me, first of all, thank all the members who have  participated  in  this
debate. I think it's been  a  very  lively  debate.  I  also  think  it  has
underscored - except for one province and two parties - the  unanimity  with
which we want to adopt this piece of legislation. Thank  you  very  much  to
everybody.

Let me start, before you stop me, by answering  some  of  the  controversial
issues. First of all, I want to deal with Mrs Gouws and Dr Nel because  they
spoke about supply  and  demand  in  particular.  I  think  they  should  be
informed that  it  is  well  known  that  health  is  an  imperfect  market.
Therefore normal market theories don't apply  and,  in  fact,  they  provide
pervasive incentives.

If there are too many facilities or  professionals  in  one  area  then,  in
order to survive, there is overservicing and overprescribing. It also  leads
to situations of kickbacks,  as  we  have  seen  happening.  Therefore,  the
certificate of need prevents this from happening. If Mrs Gouws  and  Dr  Nel
were saying they don't support the Bill because of the certificate of  need,
then  they  were  saying  or  implying   that   they   want   overservicing,
overprescribing and kickbacks to happen in this country. May I tell  Dr  Nel
that I am not going to review this piece of legislation - it is perfect.  He
asked, as he was passing here, if we could  discuss  it.  I  don't  want  to
engage in any further discussions. I think this is a very perfect  piece  of
legislation.

I think it was Dr Nel who also raised the issue of  migration  -  the  brain
drain of health workers in  our  country.  I  just  think  he  also  doesn't
understand the issues. Maybe I should have come to address  the  NCOP  about
the efforts that we have  been  putting  in  place,  as  the  Department  of
Health. Dr Nel and all of you - I think you will benefit,  anyway  -  nobody
in this country says we must  stop  people  from  travelling.  It  is  their
constitutional right. All of us suddenly have passports. You know, we  never
had the green book before. We now have the green book or  the  orange  book,
whatever you call it - the passport. You can shake your head but it's  true.
You actually did not  want  to  give  us  passports  and  now  we  have  the
passports and so anybody can travel.

However, the difficulty is that, as people travel, they  cut  bridges.  They
think it's rosy out there;  they  stop  paying  their  pensions;  they  stop
paying their medical aids; and they sell their houses and  cars.  When  they
get there, what happens to them? They live in small rooms of this size,  and
they eat fish and chips. You know, they think the  pound  is  much  stronger
than the rand, and what's happening now? I  think  I  feel  very  sorry  for
them.

In fact, I was in Britain just two or three weeks back. I attended  the  UK-
South Africa conference to celebrate our 10  years  of  democracy  in  South
Africa. This gave me an opportunity to speak to quite  a  number  of  nurses
who actually asked for an appointment to talk to me. They all want  to  come
back and they want to come and serve the country. They said  it  is  not  as
they had been informed by the media or by the agencies that came to  recruit
them.

Unfortunately, they took voluntary packages and now we  have  to  crack  our
heads to see how we recruit them back to South Africa because we need  them,
and they are South Africans  anyway.  So,  please  don't  spread  the  wrong
information about  health  workers  living  in  this  country.  You  can  go
anywhere and I can tell you about a number of doctors who left and  who  now
want to come back. I think we  must  really  be  very  patriotic,  as  South
Africans. We must tell the truth and advise our people correctly because  to
spread the wrong information, I think, is criminal.

Let me just also say that we have, in fact for  the  first  time,  signed  a
memorandum of understanding with the UK in which both of us  -  the  UK  and
South Africa and we intend to do this with Australia, Canada, and  so  on  -
say, ``Yes, we allow you to come and recruit in  our  country.  We  are  not
stopping you but please be transparent in the manner in which  you  recruit.
And, when you recruit please make sure that you  don't  disrupt  our  health
care services''.

We have also agreed, in the memorandum of understanding, that  Britain  will
assist us recruit there. And, as we recruit from Britain,  people  who  will
come and work in this country will be influenced, in fact, to  go  and  work
in the rural areas like the good old missionaries, you  see.  So  you  don't
have this information and, therefore, you are going to go  around  spreading
the wrong information and, in fact, encouraging our health professionals  to
leave. I think that that is not correct. I would  really  really  appeal  to
you, particularly because we are in coalition, to really spread the  correct
information. I think I have dealt with both of you in that regard.

I'd like now to thank the UCDP for  supporting  the  Bill.  Thank  you  very
much.

Iyazi ukuthi  sivelaphi  nokuthi  sifuna  ukwenzani  la  eNingizimu  Afrika.
Ngibonge  kakhulu  futhi  naKwaZulu-Natal.  Beningangilahla  kanjani  kodwa?
Angithi silungiselela abantu  bakithi  sonke.  Abanye  abazi  ukuthi  sifuna
ukwenzani, bayazidabhuzela nje oGouws  noNel.  Thina  siyazi  ukuthi  sifuna
ukwenzani  nokuthi  sibhekephi.  Sifuna  ukuthuthukisa   imiphakathi   yethu
nemindeni yethu ukuze babe nempilo  ethuthukile  emphakathini.  (Translation
of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[They know where we come from and what it is that we want  to  do  in  South
Africa. I would also like to thank  KwaZulu-Natal.  Anyway,  how  could  you
have let me down? It is true that all of us are  improving  things  for  all
our people. Others do not know what we intend to do; Gouws and  Nel  do  not
have any direction. We know what we want to do and where we want to  be.  We
want to develop our communities and our families in order to have  a  better
life.]

Let me then also turn to Dugmore. I really  feel  sorry  for  you,  my  kind
brother. I know the message you are bringing across  but,  of  course,  your
hands are tied. How can you be linked with Nel, honestly,  in  this  debate?
It's really a pity, but let me thank you for exposing the DA  for  who  they
are. I think that was a really brilliant expos√© of who  the  DA  are  and  I
will not go into details about that.

Comrade Gwen - the MEC for health in Gauteng - let  me  say  thank  you  for
taking time to really  come  and  debate  this  very  important  Bill  which
transforms the health care sector and services  in  our  country.  I  really
regret that my other colleagues are not  here  but,  of  course,  I  do  not
undermine the statements that have been made by the  special  delegates  and
the members of the NCOP. I think they have been very  very  valuable.  Thank
you very much for coming.

Let me just remind you that, obviously, our health  care  system  which  was
adopted by this Government is based on primary health care. So there  is  no
way that we all must stand back and see primary health care being ruined  in
this country. It is our  responsibility,  nationally  and  provincially,  to
always protect the principles of primary health care in  our  country.  It's
not  just  the  responsibility  of  the  national  Government,  it  is   our
responsibility  collectively  and,  therefore,  I  really  hope   that   the
provinces themselves will find or mobilise resources  in  the  provinces  to
make sure that we keep on improving delivery through  primary  health  care.
It cannot be just the responsibility of the national Government.

Let me, at the same time, really congratulate you, MEC, on  the  progressive
improvement to access in your province and improving the quality  of  health
care in Gauteng. I noticed that and I'm really excited about it.

I also want to comment just  a  little  bit,  and  this  will  just  be  one
sentence,  around  what  was  raised  by   Free   State   with   regard   to
antiretroviral drugs. I want to say I am hoping that colleagues did  read  a
statement in yesterday's paper, This Day, and there was a photograph of  our
President there; and also This Day of 20 October, where Robert Gallo who  is
the founder and the one who identified the virus  said:  ``Beware  of  using
antiretrovirals.'' He warned - he said beware.  He  said  instead  he  would
encourage developing countries to do additional  research  and  train  their
health workers but beware of antiretrovirals.

It's not me but the man who discovered the virus. So I'm hoping you can  get
hold of that article and read it for yourselves. I don't  have  enough  time
to elaborate on what  he  said.  It  is  in  This  Day  of  20  October  and
yesterday's This Day, and in that article  there  is  a  photograph  of  our
President. Also, last week there was a similar article in The  Citizen.  So,
I hope you can really read that and begin to  interrogate:  What  are  these
people saying to us as South Africans, because I know there  is  this  Wooh!
Wooh!  Wooh:  The  other  day  I  said  I  wish  I  could  have  all   these
antiretrovirals and stand out there and say, ``Come ye,  come  ye  and  chow
these antiretrovirals!'' But, I just warn, I just warn that  it  is  not  an
easy programme. It is not an easy programme. I am glad that you raised  this
matter.

In the main, before you ask me to sit down, Chairperson, I'd  also  like  to
thank  the  MEC  for  Health  of  Mpumalanga  for  really  focusing  on  and
emphasising the human rights for both the health care users and health  care
providers as enshrined in the Bill before us. However, let me just thank  my
colleagues from the ANC who contributed in this debate. I  would  have  been
surprised because I think we have  come  a  long  way  with  this  piece  of
legislation. It has its roots in the ANC health plan, the  green  book,  and
all that we are doing is to try and translate it into legislation  and  also
the implementation thereof.

I'd also like to thank the  chairperson  of  the  committee  very  much  and
actually admit that it was an omission on our  part  not  to  refer  to  the
traditional health practitioners in the Bill.  But,  I  would  like  to  say
thank you very much to the NCOP for having highlighted that.  Last  night  I
had a very fruitful meeting with the traditional  health  professionals  and
practitioners and I think they are really on our side.  Therefore,  we  need
to work with them and do everything to support their efforts. After all,  it
is about us contributing to the African Renaissance and Nepad.  It  is  also
about us asserting ourselves regarding who we are and not always relying  on
western medicine. It is about us  doing  those  things  that  India,  China,
Senegal and Burkina Faso are doing, supported by the WHO.  So,  I  think  we
are well on track with regard to traditional health practitioners.

I also want to express my  regret,  as  much  as  you  have  expressed  your
regrets, regarding the lack of participation in the consultations  by  Salga
and Gauteng. However, we've been in constant  discussion  with  the  MEC  of
Gauteng. Obviously, it would have helped if they  had  come  to  participate
when there were submissions in the committee. I also want to say that  Salga
has actually been participating in Minmec. I  don't  know  what  went  wrong
that they did not come and participate when we were  receiving  submissions.
I really do regret that and I hope we can do better next time.

As I mentioned, the National Health Bill has been  extensively  debated  and
discussed at no less than 17 PHRCs  and  15  Minmecs  over  the  last  seven
years. It has also been discussed with numerous other departments. I'm  sure
you will agree that there has been extensive consultation and I  must  point
out that there has been agreement with all  these  various  structures.  The
reason for agreement was captured in my  speech  to  the  National  Assembly
that this National Health Bill is the most important  piece  of  legislation
in the history of our country in transforming our health system.

I refer you back to our preamble, which states and I quote:


  In terms of section 27(2)  of  the  Constitution,  the  State  must  take
  reasonable and other measures within its available resources  to  achieve
  progressive realisation of the rights of people of South Africa  to  have
  access to health services.

The preamble further states:


  In  order  to  provide  for  a  system  of  co-operative  governance  and
  management of health services in which each  province,  municipality  and
  health district must address issues of policy and delivery of quality  of
  health services ...

Therefore, there can be no ``ifs'', there can be no ``buts'' and  there  can
be no ``on condition''.  It  is  our  constitutional  obligation  to  ensure
equitable access to health services within available resources.

Within the system of corporate governance, we all have a responsibility  for
this. Let me just say that members will remember that WHO rated us very  low
because of this perceived lack of stewardship  by  Government  in  order  to
address transformation of health care services in our country,  particularly
the private health care sector. Therefore, we are now really doing  what  is
expected of us both by the Constitution and the international community.

I'm sure that in the spirit of transformation  of  our  health  system,  all
three spheres of government will work together to  address  operational  and
other issues that  will  inevitably  ensure  that  legislation  is,  indeed,
implemented. In fact, it is  no  longer  a  question  of  the  cost  of  the
implementation of this Bill; we should rather be asking what the  cost  will
be to the country if we do not implement. Therefore, for the people of  this
country, I urge you all to unequivocally give  your  full  support  to  this
Bill, and I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall  now  put  the  question.  The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. As the decision  is  dealt  with  in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I  shall  first  ascertain  whether
delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast their provinces'  votes.
It looks as if they are all present.
In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declaration of vote if they so wish. Yes, hon MEC.

Declaration of vote:

Dr G M RAMOKGOPA: Thank you very much, Deputy Chair. I have  highlighted  in
my speech the reasons for supporting the Bill. The Gauteng province  mandate
is also very clear: The Bill is  supported  on  the  understanding  that  in
implementing  clause  93(3),  the  transitional  mechanism  will  take  into
account the cost of redefinition of municipal health services. Thank you.

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you.  There  is  no  other
declaration. We shall now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall  do
this in alphabetical  order  per  province.  Delegation  heads  must  please
indicate to the Chair whether they vote in  favour  or  against  or  abstain
from voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms N C KONDLO: I-Eastern Cape iwawuxhasa lo Mthetho oYilwayo.  [The  Eastern
Cape supports this Bill.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

Mr E NOE (Free State): Chairperson, Free State supports the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Dr G M RAMOKGOPA (Gauteng): Chairperson, Gauteng supports the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

But in my province, we are going to abstain.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Does the Western Cape abstain?
Mr C M DUGMORE: Yes, it abstains.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. Eight  provinces  voted  in
favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to in terms  of  section  65  of
the Constitution. [Applause.]

Mr C  M  DUGMORE:  Chairperson,  something  has  just  been  brought  to  my
attention by my colleague behind me that,  in  fact,  he  is  the  permanent
delegate and I'm only a  special  delegate.  I  don't  want  to  affect  the
progress of this Bill but I'm informed by my colleague behind  me  that,  in
fact, he is the one who is supposed to abstain, not myself.  I'm  not  fully
aware of the Rules of this House but could you make a ruling.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. What we know  is  that  you
are representing your province here. Order!

                       FIREARMS CONTROL AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the principal Act, the Firearms Control Act,  Act
60 of 2000, elicited a great deal of public  debate.  The  contemplation  of
the regulations under the principal Act has also, to some  extent,  elicited
debate.

The select committee tried to keep abreast of the issues in  the  debate  by
following  the  publications  of  both   the   programme   lobby   and   the
organisation, Gun Free South Africa. In the view of  the  select  committee,
there were no contentious matters or policy changes in this Amendment Bill.

Certainly, no contentious issues were raised in the committee when the  Bill
was considered. I have just been informed at the start of this plenary  that
one party considers a part of the Bill to be  contentious,  but  more  about
that later.[Interjections.]

Well,  I  am  sorry,  it  was  not  indicated.   It   was   in   confidence.
[Interjections.] In the main, the  Bill  proposes  lexical  and  grammatical
changes. In clause 1, the definition of ``air gun'' is changed  by  defining
it in terms of both calibre and muzzle energy.  The  spelling  of  the  word
``calibre'' is also corrected. There is also  a  consequent  change  to  the
definiton of ``firearm''.

The definitions of ``security officer'' and  ``security  service  provider''
are adjusted to be consistent with the Private Security Industry  Regulation
Act, Act 56 of 2001. Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 amend sections 4,  9,  16  and
20 of the principal Act respectively. The changes proposed in these  clauses
are  lexical  in  nature.  They  simply  change  the  wording  to   aid   in
interpretation and provide for greater clarity and definition.

Clause 7 of the Bill amends section 23 of the principal Act. I  am  informed
that this is the clause to which an objection will be raised. Section 23  of
the principal Act as it presently stands can be read to say  that  only  one
part of the firearm needs to carry  a  mark  or  an  identification  number,
either on the barrel, the frame or the receiver.

The proposed amendment makes it clear that a firearm must be marked  in  two
places on the barrel and the frame or on the barrel and  the  receiver.  The
proposed amendment must be read in the context of section  23  as  a  whole.
Section 23(1) provides that a firearm licence  can  only  be  issued  if  it
bears a mark by which  it  can  be  identified.  Section  23(3)  allows  the
registrar on good cause shown  to  depart  from  this  requirement.  Section
23(3) should be sufficient to deal with the concerns raised at the start  of
this plenary session.

Clause 8 of the Bill amends section 59 of the Act and allows both  gunsmiths
and their apprentices to perform certain works on firearms.

Clauses 9, 10, 11 and  12  amend  sections  80,  98,  104  and  105  of  the
principal Act respectively. The  changes  are  merely  improvements  in  the
wording to simplify and aid interpretation.

Clause 13(a) makes grammatical changes to aid in the interpretation of  this
section. Clause 13(b) proposes an amendment that makes it plain that  it  is
the definition section of the principal Act that is being referred  to.  The
amendments in clause 14 delete  an  unnecessary  repetition  and  correct  a
spelling mistake.

The amendments in clauses 15 and 16 amend certain typographical errors  that
are necessary for the  proper  implementation  of  the  principal  Act.  The
amendments in clause 17 will allow  the  Minister  to  make  regulations  in
relation to gun-free zones specifically  relating  to  the  demarcation  and
signposting of firearm-free zones to inform the  public  of  the  status  of
such premises as a firearm-free zone.

Clause 19 proposes changes to the transitional provisions to provide  for  a
better description of a certificate to carry out the  trade  of  a  gunsmith
under the previous Act. This clause allows for such certificate to be  valid
for a year from the commencement of the principal Act.

The  amendments  proposed  in   clause   22   delete   certain   errors   in
crossreferencing in Schedule 4 with the relevant sections in  the  principal
Act. The Bill was unanimously accepted in the select  committee.  I  commend
it to the House for adoption.[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes  the  debate.  I  shall
now put the question. The  question  is  that  the  Bill  be  agreed  to  in
accordance  with  Rule  63.  I  shall  first  allow  political  parties  the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they so wish.

Declaration of Vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, the ACDP has made no secret of the fact that  we
are against the constant focus of  the  authorities  on  firearms  that  are
lawfully owned, stored and used. It is like  the  traffic  police  harassing
only law-abiding motorists and not focusing on dangerous drivers  of  stolen
vehicles.

We consider the proposed amendment to have the identification number of  the
firearm retrospectively stamped on two parts of  a  weapon,  namely  on  the
barrel and/or the frame will be a massive fruitless, costly and  unnecessary
exercise simply inflicting damage upon the available firearms.

It is time the authorities began to turn their  attention  to  the  criminal
owners of unlawful weapons, instead of expending the energy  of  law-abiding
gunowners that are simply attempting to protect  their  lives  and  property
because of the failure of the state to do so. The  ACDP  will  vote  against
this legislation. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We shall now proceed  to  the  voting.
Those in favour say ``aye''; those against, ``no''.  I  think  the  ``ayes''
have it. The majority of members  have  voted  in  favour  and  I  therefore
declare  the  Bill   agreed   to   in   terms   of   section   75   of   the
Constitution.[Applause.]

Debate concluded.
The Council adjourned at 16:40.
