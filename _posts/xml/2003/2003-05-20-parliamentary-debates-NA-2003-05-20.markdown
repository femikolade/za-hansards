                          CELEBRATING AFRICAN UNITY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU (ANC): Madam Speaker, leaders  of  the  African  continent
will gather this Sunday in Pretoria, South Africa,  to  celebrate  the  30th
anniversary of the  Organisation  of  African  Unity  on  Africa  Day.  This
celebration occurs exactly a year since the formation of the African  Union.
This celebration marks Africa's success in the struggle against slavery  and
colonialism.

The objectives of this festival are to  encourage  public  participation  in
SADC  events,  to  highlight  the  benefits  of  regional  co-operation   by
presenting a combined multidisciplinary festival with participants from  all
SADC member states, and to promote culture in  the  region  as  a  means  of
promoting  co-operation  in  pursuit  of  the  realisation  of  the  African
Renaissance and the New Partnership for Africa's Development, Nepad.

This festival also provides a platform for the people of the region and  the
continent to share ideas and engage  in  cultural  exchanges.  The  artistic
expression that will be  taking  place  at  this  festival  will  act  as  a
foundation  to  cement  friendships,  facilitate   economic   activity   and
contribute  to  the  overall  struggle  to  move  back  the   frontiers   of
xenophobia. We call on all  our  people  to  attend  all  activities,  which
celebrate the success of Africa's struggle to break free from  the  yoke  of
imperialism, and to celebrate African  unity  and  Africa's  rebirth.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

                           DA'S ANTICRIME CAMPAIGN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Madam  Speaker,  the  DA  has  launched  an  anticrime
campaign, because crime is getting out of control in parts of  our  country.
South Africa has a weak criminal justice system, despite the  billions  paid
annually to fund it. The SAPS  is  grossly  undermanned,  underequipped  and
undertrained. We need to place 150 000  policemen  mainly  in  neighbourhood
police stations to make our streets safe for our children and our people.
Every police station  needs  to  be  manned  by  enough  policemen  who  are
properly trained, who are properly equipped and who are  subject  to  agreed
performance targets, and then those policemen need to  be  held  to  account
and accept responsibility. The successful cops  must  keep  their  jobs  and
receive recognition and cash. The failures and the corrupt  must  be  fired.
It is only when criminals are  safely  locked  inside  jail  that  ordinary,
decent South Africans will start feeling safe. We need  a  criminal  justice
system that works. [Applause.]

                              DIAMONDS AND WARS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E J LUCAS (IFP): Madam Speaker, it is a  well-known  fact  that  Africa's
natural resources have often provided the impetus for war, civil strife  and
general destruction and loss of life. This is particularly true in the  case
of diamonds which have fuelled wars in Angola, the  DRC  and  Sierra  Leone.
Recent estimates indicate that illegal diamonds sold  on  the  international
market may have funded as much as US$800 million worth of arms purchased  to
sustain conflict on the African continent.
The IFP strongly supports moves to curb illegal trading in  so-called  blood
diamonds and was particularly pleased with  the  leading  role  our  country
took in establishing the Kimberley Process that entails the United  Nations-
backed certification programme to stop illegal diamond trading.

The certification programme came into force on 31 January 2003 and has  been
signed by 70 countries up to  this  point.  In  essence,  the  certification
programme bans all trade in rough diamonds  with  countries  that  have  not
signed the accord and requires trade in  all  diamonds  shipments  to  carry
special certificates.

Recently, the Kimberley Process was further strengthened  by  the  agreement
reached in the World Trade  Organisation  to  underwrite  the  certification
programme and to allow countries to breach trade and to ban the  import  and
export of uncut diamonds and other gems.  This  agreement  allows  countries
that have signed the certification accord  to  bypass  normal  international
trade rules to stop the flow of blood diamonds.

The IFP strongly ... [Time expired.]

                    UNIFEM'S WOMEN, WAR AND PEACE REPORT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN (ANC): Madam Speaker, last Friday  a  number  of
women dignitaries gathered to launch Unifem's report Women,  War  and  Peace
on 16 May in  the  national  Parliament.  The  report  follows  UN  Security
Council Resolution 1325 of 2000, which called for a further study on  women,
war and peace. Unifem appointed Ms Rehn, the former Minister of defence  and
equality affairs of Finland and Ms Johnson Sirleaf, a former member  of  the
Organisation of African Unity's Panel of  Eminent  Persons,  to  investigate
the genocide in Rwanda.

These experts travelled to  14  conflict-ridden  countries  and  interviewed
women in these countries in order to bring  their  concerns  to  the  United
Nations and the world. The document covers many areas of concern - from  the
gender dimensions of violence and displacement during conflict, to the  role
of peacekeepers and the need for women to play a central part  during  peace
negotiations and reconstruction.

The  recommendations  of  this  report  include  the  establishment  of   an
international truth and reconciliation commission on violence against  women
in armed conflict as a step towards  ending  impunity,  the  recognition  of
domestic violence as systematic and widespread in conflict and  postconflict
situations and that it be addressed with humanitarian,  legal  and  security
responses. This report contributes  to  the  overall  struggle  for  women's
emancipation ...

The SPEAKER: Thank you, hon member. Much as I would like  you  to  continue,
you still have to stop.

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN: Thank you. [Applause.]

      ALLEGATIONS OF HOW CERTAIN MEMBERS TARNISH CREDIBILITY OF PUBLIC
                               REPRESENTATIVES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Madam Speaker, yesterday in this  House  we
were audience to a typical example of people who throw stones although  they
live in glass houses. DA member - although I don't  know  whether  he  knows
himself - the hon Blanché had the audacity to quote examples of how the  New
NP and the ANC, according to him, have tarnished the image  of  this  august
House and the credibility of public representatives in  general.  He  forgot
to mention members of his own party, the DP-DA, as the  party  was  referred
to by the hon Leon on national TV last night.

It is important that we complete the list for the  hon  Blanché,  the  self-
imposed jockey of the moral high horse. [Laughter.]  Just  last  week  a  DA
councillor from Cape Town was banned  from  a  local  casino  for  allegedly
stealing; and the leader of the DA caucus in Mogale City is  out  on  R2 000
bail on charges of armed robbery,  the  pointing  of  a  firearm,  malicious
damage to property, theft and assault. [Interjections.]

At the slightest hint of impropriety, the DA calls on people  to  resign  or
be fired. What the New NP wants to know today  is:  What  has  the  DA  done
about these two people? Let us not forget  about  Morkel  for  that  matter.
This is the same party who just yesterday - and you heard today  -  launched
its anticrime campaign. [Interjections.]

We want to say to the DA to stop setting standards that they  measure  other
people against, but that they don't live up to. We say:  Practice  what  you
preach. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

     SLOW PACE OF INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO PREVENT KILLINGS IN THE DRC

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv Z L MADASA (ACDP): Madam Speaker, we in the ACDP are  extremely  unhappy
about the inaction or slow pace of the international  community  to  prevent
killings in the face of the slaughter of  innocent  people  in  the  eastern
part of the DRC. These gruesome killings are happening in  the  same  region
where millions were killed during the Burundi and Rwanda genocide.

Ironically,  these  killings  are  taking  place  simultaneously  with   the
continued looting and raping of the DRC's minerals by elements of  the  same
international community that is turning a blind eye to these murders. As  in
Angola in the past, it seems that peace in the DRC may  result  in  loss  of
profit for the existing cheap and secretive  mining  operations  of  foreign
campanies, with the collusion of some corrupt  and  greedy  African  leaders
and captains of industry who are profiting by riding on the  back  of  these
killings. The message is clear: African lives  are  cheap  while  Africa  is
rich in minerals. The continued  killings  in  the  DRC  are  once  more  an
example of the glaring  weaknesses  of  multilateral  forums,  like  the  UN
especially, when it pertains to African problems.

The African Union has the huge responsibility of speeding up the working  of
the peace and security commission to prevent loss of  life  in  the  future.
These killings are another reminder that reliance on external help to  solve
African problems is not  going  to  help.  Sadly,  those  who  made  up  the
cacophony of protest we heard when Iraq  was  invaded  are  dead  silent  on
these unnecessary killings. [Applause.]

                         REHABILITATION OF PRISONERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D V BLOEM (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Department of  Correctional  Services
recently hosted the fourth national prisoner choir competition at  the  Good
Hope Centre, Cape Town, at which over 1 400 prisoners from  various  prisons
throughout the country participated.

The department has put rehabilitation at the centre of all  its  activities.
This means that more than  ever  before,  the  department  is  focusing  its
attention  on  correcting  the  offending  behaviour  of  inmates;  and   on
equipping offenders with knowledge, skills and attributes that  will  enable
them to successfully  reintegrate  into  their  communities  as  law-abiding
citizens. With this new  direction  and  within  this  paradigm,  the  choir
competition becomes an important vehicle towards attaining the  departmental
strategic objective of rehabilitation.

Since its inception in 1977, the  competition  has  grown  in  size  and  in
popularity among offenders. It started with only three categories,  and  now
has five categories with the inclusion of the mixed  and  youth  categories.
The competition has indeed created  a  platform  for  offenders  to  express
themselves and showcase their musical talents. It  is  estimated  that  over
10 000 offenders participated  in  this  year's  competition  at  provincial
level. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
                             COMBATING OF CRIME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr P J GROENEWALD (VF): Mevrou die Speaker,  misdaad  in  Suid-Afrika  neem
nou sulke afmetings aan dat die publiek vertroue verloor in die Regering  se
vermoë om misdaad werklik te bekamp.

Die koers waarteen polisielede aan diens in Suid-Afrika vermoor word, is  77
per 100 000 van die bevolking en die hoogste in die wêreld. In  die  VSA  is
die koers 21 per 100 000. Moord, roof, verkragtings  en  kapings  word  deel
van die alledaagse lewe in Suid-Afrika  en  is  vir  die  VF  onaanvaarbaar.
Misdaad bekamping is nie net die taak van die SAPD nie, maar die  regstelsel
en spesifiek strafstelsel speel 'n kardinale rol daarin.

Die VF ondersteun pogings om meer SAPD-lede aan te stel, maar dit alleen  is
nie genoeg nie en gaan nie die probleem oplos nie. Die VF is van mening  dat
die hoë vlak van misdaad nou vereis dat dit tyd geword het om die  doodstraf
vir moord en verkragting weer in te stel. Die doodstraf word  tans  in  baie
lande steeds toegepas. In 'n  moderne  demokrasie  soos  die  VSA  word  dit
steeds toegelaat. Die doodstraf word juis toegepas om te verseker dat  moord
op onskuldige burgers  afneem  en  dien  daarom  as  afskrikmiddel  vir  die
misdadiger.

Die afwesigheid van die doodstraf veroorsaak dat  misdadigers  moord  as  'n
instrument gebruik om hul misdade te pleeg. Die  doodstraf  sal  moordenaars
en verkragters twee keer laat dink voordat hulle so 'n misdaad pleeg en  sal
'n bydrae lewer om misdaad te bekamp. Die DA vra vir meer  polisielede;  die
VF  sê:  bring  terug  die  doodstraf.  Dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD (FF): Madam Speaker, crime in South Africa has now  taken
on such proportions that the public  has  lost  faith  in  the  Government's
ability to truly combat crime.

The rate at which police members on duty are murdered in South Africa is  77
per 100 000 of the population, and the highest  in  the  world.  The  United
States has a rate of 21 per 100 000. Murder, robbery, rape  and  hi-jackings
are becoming part  of  our  everyday  life  in  South  Africa  and  this  is
unacceptable for the FF. The combating of crime is not only the task of  the
SAPS, but the legal  system  and  specifically  the  penal  system  plays  a
crucial role in this.

The FF supports attempts to appoint more SAPS members,  but  that  alone  is
not enough and will not solve the problem. The FF is  of  the  opinion  that
the high level of crime now demands that it has become time  to  reinstitute
the death penalty for murder and rape. The death penalty is currently  still
being applied in many countries. In a modern democracy such  as  the  United
States it is still allowed.  The  death  penalty  is  allowed  precisely  to
ensure that murder of innocent citizens decrease and thus  it  serves  as  a
deterrent to the criminal.

The absence of the death penalty  causes  criminals  to  use  murder  as  an
instrument to commit their crimes. The death  penalty  will  make  murderers
and rapists think twice before they commit such a crime,  and  will  make  a
contribution towards combating crime. The DA asks for more  police  members,
the FF says: Bring back the death penalty. Thank you.]

                VIGILANTE GROUP AT UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr A N LUTHULI (ANC): Madam Speaker, the University  of  Stellenbosch  acted
decisively on reports of a racial incident in one of its hostels.

It was reported that there was a vigilante group  that  operated  in  Majuba
hostel at the university. This group  assaulted  black  students,  Jews  and
gays. Following reports of the  activities  of  this  vigilante  group,  the
institution commissioned an investigation which led to the dismissal  of  Mr
Du Toit, and the suspension of the two students alleged to  belong  to  this
vigilante group. The Human Rights Commission  is  also  conducting  its  own
investigation into this incident.

The ANC welcomes the decisive action taken  by  the  university  in  dealing
with this situation. We believe  that  this  will  prevent  incidents  of  a
racist nature from occurring in the institution. We  further  condemn  those
students who assaulted others simply for being black, Jewish  or  gay.  Such
actions cannot be tolerated in the new South Africa we are  building.  These
actions  are  contrary  to  the  national  effort  of  building  unity   and
reconciliation.
We support further investigations into this  incident,  and  hope  that  the
outcome of the investigations will assist in building  unity  and  tolerance
at the university and in society as a whole. I thank you. [Applause.]

                      NATIONAL ACADEMY OF INTELLIGENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W J SEREMANE (DA): Madam Speaker, profoundly sad is the decision to  name
the National Academy of Intelligence after a man  who  was  responsible  for
human rights abuses in the  ANC  Quatro  torture  camps.  This  betrays  the
memories of those men and women who were tortured in those camps.

Mr Mzwandile Piliso, head  of  the  ANC's  department  of  intelligence  and
security between 1981 and 1986, was singled out by the  Skweyiya  commission
for his involvement in human rights  abuses.  The  academy  is  supposed  to
symbolise South Africa's commitment to a culture  of  intelligence-gathering
which is free of the dirty tricks and torture tactics of the past, but  this
ideal will now be lost.

Many families, especially those living close to  the  academy  in  Mafikeng,
still don't know what happened to  their  loved  ones  in  the  ANC  torture
camps. Mr Piliso was not very forthcoming in his  disclosures  to  the  TRC,
and yet the ANC has rewarded him in this inappropriate  manner.  This  is  a
very sad  day.  Indeed,  equity  and  justice  still  bleed.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

                UNACCEPTABILITY OF SA'S HIGH CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr A I  VAN  NIEKERK  (VA):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  gebeure  gister  in
Stellenbosch se strate waar motorkapers 'n man in die bors  geskiet  het  ná
'n rooftog, en 'n skoolmeisie met 'n rewolwer  teen  die  kop  gedreig  het,
soos op vele ander plekke in Suid-Afrika, is onaanvaarbaar.

Net so onaanvaarbaar is die  feit  dat  daar  in  Suid-Afrika  elke  dag  60
kinders as verkrag aangemeld word,  59  mense  per  dag  vermoor  word,  139
vrouens verkrag word en 817 inbrake  per  dag  by  huise  plaasvind.  Daarom
steun die FA die aksie van die DA dat iets daadwerkliks  daaromtrent  gedoen
moet word, en dat 50 000 meer polisiemanne en -vroue se  ontplooing  op  ons
strate  'n  noodsaaklikheid  is.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Dr A I VAN NIEKERK  (FA):  Madam  Speaker,  the  events  yesterday  in  the
streets of Stellenbosch, where car-hijackers shot a man in the  chest  after
a robbery and threatened a schoolgirl  with  a  revolver  held  against  her
head, such as occur in many other places in South Africa, are unacceptable.

Equally unacceptable is the fact that daily 60 children are  being  reported
as having been raped in South Africa, that 59 people are murdered, that  139
women are raped and that 817 houses are burgled.  For  this  reason  the  FA
supports the action of the DA that something concrete should be  done  about
this, and that the deployment of another 50 000  policemen  and  policewomen
in our streets is essential. I thank you. [Applause.]]

                  TOUGH MEASURES TO MINIMISE ROAD ACCIDENTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M V NGEMA (IFP): Madam Speaker, at the beginning of  September  2003  the
national Department of Transport will introduce tough measures  to  minimise
road accidents by introducing the Australian model demerit system.

In terms of this system, each driver is  allocated  12  points  in  a  year.
Through omission or the  breaking  of  traffic  laws,  points  are  deducted
depending on the nature and extent of  the  offence.  Certain  offences  may
result in the suspension or revocation of the driver's licence. The  demerit
system will address speeding, failure to wear  a  seat  belt,  unoperational
tail-lights and failure to produce or carry  a  driver's  licence.  However,
the driver who remains penalty-free in a year will carry  over  his  or  her
merit points and receive an extra point on top of the  12  points  allocated
annually.

It is also going to be stipulated that accumulated points will not  work  in
cases in which a driver engages in drunken driving,  excessive  speeding  or
running over a pedestrian while inebriated.

We in the IFP welcome this move by the Department  of  Transport,  and  hope
that it will help to reduce the  carnage  on  our  roads,  thus  inculcating
sensible driving aimed at securing the  lives  of  drivers,  passengers  and
pedestrians. Thank you, Speaker.

                          2010 SOCCER WORLD CUP BID

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N E LAMANI (ANC): Madam Speaker, the South African national soccer  team,
Bafana Bafana, play England in Durban on Thursday. We note that  the  soccer
match between these two countries marks  the  international  launch  of  our
country's 2010  soccer  World  Cup  bid.  We  wish  to  state  that  we  are
encouraged and pleased with the manner in which the bid campaign  -  led  by
Irvin Khoza and Danny Jordaan - to host the  prestigious  soccer  World  Cup
has been handled thus far.

We, furthermore, commend Safa  for  the  role  it  is  playing  in  the  bid
campaign. We also commend the Government and business for the  support  they
continue to give to the 2010 soccer World Cup bid. We believe  that  hosting
the soccer World Cup will benefit the country and Africa immensely. We  hold
the view that South Africa's success  in  hosting  this  event  will  impact
positively on the African Renaissance,  as  championed  by  President  Thabo
Mbeki.

We realise that our country's  success  in  bidding  to  host  this  popular
international soccer showpiece will also be determined by  the  co-operation
and cohesion displayed by all the role-players. It is for this  reason  that
we are concerned about the negative events surrounding the staging  of  this
match. We therefore urge that those concerned  co-operate  and  resolve  all
issues  which  might  impede  the  positive  projection  of  South   African
football. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                           SHORTAGE OF AMBULANCES

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S J GOUS (Nuwe  NP):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  aanvaarde  sisteem  van
primêre gesondheidsorg berus grootliks op  'n  verwysingsisteem  wat  primêr
afhanklik is van goeie ambulans- en vervoerdienste.

In die  uitgebreide  platteland  is  dit  nog  meer  van  toepassing  as  in
stedelike gebiede. Om hierdie rede is die Nuwe NP geskok  oor  die  Minister
van Gesondheid se antwoord op 'n vraag oor ambulansdienste  in  Suid-Afrika,
waarin  sy  onder  andere  die  volgende  kommerwekkende  tekorte   in   die
onderskeie provinsies bekend maak: In  die  Oos-Kaap  is  daar  'n  geraamde
tekort van 160 ambulanse, en slegs 26% van hul ambulanse is bruikbaar en  is
gemiddeld 10 jaar oud; KwaZulu-Natal het 'n  tekort  van  600  ambulanse  en
slegs 50% van die huidige  ambulanse  is  bruikbaar.  Volgens  die  Minister
benodig al die provinsies bykomende ambulanse  om  te  voorsien  in  huidige
behoeftes.

Die Nuwe NP glo dat omdat die Regering verbind is tot  dienslewering,  hulle
hierdie skrynende tekorte  in  samewerking  met  die  provinsiale  regerings
onmiddellik sal aanspreek, want dit is veral die arm mense wat die  swaarste
getref word deur hierdie tekorte. Ons  kan  nie  toelaat  dat  die  openbare
gesondheidstelsel ons mense so faal nie. Dankie. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS (New NP): Madam Speaker, the accepted system of primary  health
care rests largely on a referral  system  that  depends  primarily  on  good
ambulance and transport services.
This is even more applicable in the extensive rural areas than in the  urban
areas. For this reason the New NP is shocked by the answer of  the  Minister
of Health to a question about ambulance services in South Africa,  in  which
inter alia,  she  announced  the  following  distressing  shortages  in  the
various provinces: There is an estimated shortage of 160 ambulances  in  the
Eastern Cape and only 26%  of  their  ambulances  are  useable  and  are  on
average ten years old. KwaZulu-Natal has a shortage of  600  ambulances  and
only 50% of the present ambulances are useable. According to  the  Minister,
all the provinces require additional ambulances in  order  to  fulfil  their
present needs.

The New NP believes that  since  the  Government  is  committed  to  service
delivery, they can  with  the  assistance  of  the  provincial  governments,
immediately address this dire shortage, because it is  the  poor  people  in
particular who are the most severely affected by these shortages. We  cannot
allow the public health system to fail our people like this. Thank you.]

                 VIGILANTE GROUP AT STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I must thank the ANC  comrade  who
raised  the  issue  of  racism  and  intimidation  at  the   University   of
Stellenbosch. I think this House should be quite clear about this - in  that
at places of learning there can be no place at all  for  intimidation  based
on threats of violence or the carrying out of violence.

It is a sad day when one of our principal places of learning gives  rise  to
such ill-mannered and dangerous behaviour. In particular, you may have  seen
in the last day or so that the  Vice  Chancellor,  Prof  Brink,  received  a
letter full of obscenities and racial obscenties enclosed with white  powder
in the envelope. In other countries the insertion  of  white  powder  in  an
envelope is treated as an  act  of  terrorism,  regardless  of  whether  the
powder is anthrax spores or not.

I think that this House and the whole of South Africa are right behind  Prof
Brink who has, in fact, opened up Stellenbosch University, and, at the  same
time, showed that under the stones there are slippery  creatures  who  still
want a place in the world. Prof Brink requires and demands, in my view,  our
best wishes and support for what he is doing there. [Applause.]

                           PRISONER REHABILITATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Speaker, in appreciation of  the  hon
member Bloem's statement, I would like to support what he said and add  that
rehabilitation is, in fact, a fundamental factor in reducing  crime  in  our
country.

Also, in appreciation of  his  statement  which  was  interrupted  by  Madam
Speaker, I would like to complete what he was saying. [Laughter.]  The  last
paragraph says - I didn't write this, Madam Speaker - that the  Minister  of
Correctional Services, Mr Ben Skosana, MP, and his  department  have  to  be
commended for successfully hosting this occasion ...  [Laughter]  [Applause]
... and also for the excellent  security  arrangements  which  were  put  in
place; and he hopes that the next competition  in  2005  will  receive  even
greater  public  support.  That   completes   his   statement.   [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Coming to the point raised by hon member Gibson and speaking  on  behalf  of
the Ministers in the security cluster, I think we  would  be  the  first  to
accept the fact that there are areas in the  criminal  justice  system  that
still present  some  problems.  However,  on  the  whole  and  comparatively
speaking, a lot of progress has been made on many, many fronts, as would  be
evidenced  in  the  forthcoming  budgets  of   the   police,   justice   and
correctional services. Thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister. Hon members, may  I  urge  you,  when  you
intend  commending  Ministers,  to  begin  your  statement  by   doing   so.
[Laughter.] This would prevent me having to cut you short.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                      Debate on Vote No 15 - Education:

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy  President,  who  seems
to have owned the most improved school award, the chief patron, hon  members
of the National Assembly, pupils from Harold Cressy High School and  Gardens
Commercial High School from the inner city of  Cape  Town,  invited  guests,
ladies and gentlemen, I have entitled my address and  my  budget  speech  as
the  following:  ``From  Baa  baa  black  sheep  to  the   second   law   of
thermodynamics:  Education  for   development''.   The   person   who   most
personified development was a  person  we  said  our  sad  farewells  to  on
Saturday.

We  said  our  sad  farewells  to  a  great  South   African,   gentle   and
understanding, determined and disciplined, a  person  whose  love  for  this
country, and particularly for all its children,  knew  no  bounds.  I  wish,
therefore, to dedicate this debate to the memory of Ntate Walter Sisulu.

Because he had little education, Walter Sisulu was passionate about  it.  He
believed that education was a route to  freedom  and  self-expression.  Over
the past two weeks, many  tributes  have  evoked  from  people  whom  Walter
Sisulu encouraged to study, whether  they  were  still  in  their  youth  or
advancing in age. He was most concerned, he told Thenjiwe  Mtintso,  one  of
our intellectuals, that education should be used for ``the bettering of  the
lives of people''. He concluded, ``Never forget who you are  and  where  you
come from''. This, therefore, should be our guiding principle. We shall  not
let him down.

If there were more Walter Sisulus in this world, we would not have  to  live
at a time where there is little progress  towards  the  realisation  of  our
common  humanity  and  which  recognises  and  embraces  the   extraordinary
diversity of  this  world.  As  we  move  towards  developing  an  inclusive
identity for our country, many countries in the North, especially  developed
and rich ones,  have  become  more  racist,  xenophobic  and  intolerant  of
difference. And then, of course, in other parts, ethnicity  has  raised  its
ugly head. This has resulted in increased tensions and conflict.

The moral authority of our nation, exemplified by leaders such as  the  late
Walter Sisulu and President Mbeki, compel us  to  play  a  leading  role  in
reversing these tendencies. We have demonstrated to the  world  our  ability
to overcome major political challenges. We must  now  demonstrate  the  same
fortitude and leadership in tackling the social  and  economic  problems  of
our country to push back the frontiers of poverty,  as  we  enthusiastically
embrace the UN  Millennium  Development  Goals,  the  Dakar  Declaration  on
Education,  and  the  resolutions  of  the  World  Summit   on   Sustainable
Development.

Education is a key instrument for this. In the present age of  struggle  and
strife, conflict and confrontation and terrorism, education for  development
is the most relevant and necessary issue for  contemplation  and  action  by
all nations. Education in South Africa therefore embraces the full range  of
educational activities from early  childhood  development  -  where  we  are
making good progress - a new curriculum for general and  further  education,
to special needs education, to adult basic education and  higher  education.
We  therefore  have  a  firm  commitment  to  lifelong  learning,  and   the
development of all our people.

In so doing, we contribute  to  the  national  development  by  shaping  the
nature and character of the society in which  we  live  through  the  values
provided within the education system by educating  young  people  about  the
nature and beauty of our diverse cultures and backgrounds through  providing
skills  that  fill   shortages   in   the   labour   market   and   building
entrepreneurial spirit to support the creation of new jobs.

This is why we needed to overhaul completely  the  system  we  inherited  in
1994. Nine years ago, almost to this day, we  took  responsibility  for  the
education of over 12 million children in schools and colleges,  and  another
half million students at universities  and  technikons.  The  system  was  a
chaotic  collection  of  19  departments``nogal'',  defined  by  apartheid's
racial  geography  and  ethnic  illogic,  with  huge  discrepancies  in  the
resourcing, curriculum and administration of  each.  I  believe  only  South
Africa, under the leadership of the ANC, could have achieved  the  goals  of
this monumental restructuring.

Despite  a  complex  constitutional  framework  under  Schedule  4  of   the
Constitution, but guided by a spirit of  co-operative  governance,  we  have
established national legislation and policy in all areas of  the  system.  I
should say that this is part of the delivery - to have the right policy.  We
begin with the teaching and understanding of nursery rhymes  such  as  ``Baa
baa black sheep'' in early childhood development, and offer a full range  of
the curriculum, service and facilities all the way through  to  the  complex
issues such as the second law of thermodynamics and nuclear  medicine.  This
is the essence of what education for  development  is  all  about.  All  our
people, for the first time, now have access to this development model.

Schools are financed according to national norms for  the  first  time,  and
children in public and independent schools follow  the  national  curriculum
statement. Matric  exams  are  increasingly  set  at  a  national  level  to
maintain standards, and are now  being  re-organised  -  the  whole  of  the
matric - to meet the  needs  of  a  new  South  Africa.  Teachers  are  paid
according to common pay scales, and all teachers are registered with the  SA
Council of Educators, possibly a  first  in  the  whole  of  the  continent.
National policies on school safety,  drug  abuse  and  a  variety  of  other
aspects have been introduced successfully into our schools.

The achievement of establishing a national system of education must  not  be
underestimated. It is a powerful contributor towards the  development  of  a
national  identity,  and  the  determination  of  our  national   character.
``National consciousness is'', as the famous writer  Frantz  Fanon  put  it,
``the most elaborate  form  of  culture.''  My  mentor  and  teacher,  Nobel
Laureate, Chief Albert Luthuli pre-empted these words when in 1962 he  wrote
that, and I quote:


  Education creates common attitudes and  norms  for  citizens.  It  is  an
  important unifying factor in building national  consciousness  and  pride
  and a healthy community spirit.

So, in building a united education system, many sacrifices have  had  to  be
made in the long struggle for freedom, democracy  and  human  rights,  which
have cost the lives  of  some  and  ruined  the  productive  livelihood  and
capacity of many more.

The first to be recognised are the many thousands of teachers who have  gone
well beyond the usual call of duty and showed enormous resilience  often  in
the  face  of  trying  circumstances,  especially  those   driven   by   the
imperatives  of  equity.  With  us  today,  representing   women   teachers,
particularly from rural areas - the unknown part of South Africa - who  form
the real backbone of  the  education  system  is  Mrs  Nobathwa  Makamba,  a
mathematics teacher from Matatiele,  who  has  corresponded  with  me  on  a
number of occasions about the benefits and the advantages of  outcomes-based
education - an outstanding example of  how  cultural,  educational  concepts
and ideas can change to embrace new needs. Teacher  development,  therefore,
is now the key focus of our work, and I am pleased to announce that  I  have
appointed three senior education academics, who are here, to  a  ministerial
task team that will advise and assist the  department  with,  and  give  new
impetus to teacher development, particularly with regard to  the  needs  for
the future.

One of the key elements in our progress to date has been the important  role
that  school  principals  and  other  managers  have  played  recently.  The
importance of leadership at all levels of  the  system,  but  especially  at
district and schools levels, where the teaching  and  learning  is  directly
effected, must be recognised  and  strengthened.  For  many  years,  schools
principals did not receive the credit and  recognition  due  to  them.  They
have now been  restored  to  their  rightful  place.  They  have  played  an
important part in curriculum development  and  the  Government  spends  over
R200 million a year to improve the management of  schools,  and  to  improve
the instructional leadership to teachers.

We must also acknowledge the voluntary  efforts  and  work  of  parents  and
community members. In the spirit of Letsema and vukuzenzele,  large  numbers
of people have come forward,  which  is  a  first,  to  assist  schools  and
students. They have painted and cleaned school buildings and  grounds.  They
have maintained school food gardens, and used the produce to feed  children.
In some schools, parents come in to listen  to  children  reading,  so  that
each gets the individual attention that the teachers cannot provide to  each
one of them.

Over 18% of  our  children  attend  farm  schools,  another  of  our  dismal
inheritances. But now these schools fulfil an important need, and there  are
shining examples of farmers who are working with us to  improve  the  system
of farm schooling. I am therefore pleased to acknowledge the presence  today
of three Free State farmers up there in the gallery - they are  very  large,
I must say - Mr Apie Smith, Mr de Wet Ferreira and Mr Danie le Roux  who  so
impressed the portfolio committee in their visit to  the  Free  State,  that
they compelled me to invite them, because they  have  contributed  time  and
resources to the development  and  improvement  of  farm  schools  in  their
areas. [Applause.]

A further contributor to improve quality has been the massive upgrading,  in
the past year, of teachers through  Government  intervention  and  with  the
assistance from the  Education  and  Labour  Relations  Council,  and  their
professional  registration  with  the  SA   Council   of   Educators.   This
development of teachers  has  included  the  basics  to  ensure  that  every
teacher has at least a three-year  qualification  as  well  as  professional
development informed by the code of ethics which was propounded  by  the  SA
Council of Educators. This is also supported  by  the  acceleration  of  the
implementation of our whole school evaluation programme, together  with  the
development appraisal system which will enable us, over  the  next  four  or
five years, to know exactly what is happening in each  one  of  the  27  000
schools in our country.

All our efforts have undoubtedly led to an improved quality of education.  I
would like  to  detail  some  indications  of  this.  The  revised  national
curriculum statements, first of all, for Grades R to 9 which emerged out  of
an  unprecedented  consultation  process,  have  been  widely  accepted   by
teachers and parents, and provide significantly more direction for  teachers
in regard to what can be expected at each Grade level.

Madam  Speaker,  as  you  know,  I  have  set  up  a  body  to  review   the
effectiveness and functioning of the system of school  governing  bodies,  a
system central to education and ANC and Government policy, with  a  view  to
making improvements where necessary. I  intend,  therefore,  to  touch  very
briefly on the matter that has not brought out the best in all  our  people,
who should have known better. There has been considerable  distortion  about
our intentions around additional payments to teachers  by  school  governing
bodies. Let me make it  quite  clear  that  we  prefer  a  system  of  self-
management of  this  issue,  but  it  does  require  policy  guidelines  and
regulations by  the  employer  of  teachers,  which  is  the  province.  The
Employment of Educators Act already makes it unlawful for teachers  who  are
appointed  by  the  state  to  earn  additional  remuneration  without   the
necessary authority. This does not apply to teachers who  are  appointed  by
the school governing bodies. Our current  efforts  are  simply  designed  to
infuse a degree of flexibility in this global proscription and  banning.  We
will work with the parties concerned to ensure that this  happens  with  due
regard to issues of incentive, equity and fairness.

Let me reiterate, hon members, that there is no place in education  for  the
continued maintenance of historical privilege. Nothing should  work  to  the
disadvantage of schools that suffered under apartheid, and which now  should
be receiving additional assistance, which the Government  is  committed  to.
Any continuation of privilege will contradict the equity imperative.

We have also begun to transform the nature of  our  classrooms  through  our
values in  education  initiative,  which  has  promoted  the  constitutional
values  central  to  our  nation.  This  programme  includes  an   increased
attention to history through the SA History Project which we established  so
that our children know more about our past and  the  struggle  for  freedom,
which covers the entirety of South  Africa,  including  Afrikaners,  and  to
develop an ethusiasm for the future.

In further education and training, we  have  made  substantial  progress  in
revising the curriculum for Grades 10 -12 in  schools.  This  outcomes-based
curriculum will be phased in from 2006,  once  the  preparations,  including
teacher training and materials development have  been  enthusiastically  and
satisfactorily completed. Without that, there will not  be  an  introduction
thereof.

Technical colleges, the Cinderella of our education system,  which  are  the
responsibility  of  provinces,  have  been  sadly  neglected.   A   national
intervention was therefore required  to  build  a  coherent  and,  we  hope,
vibrant further education and training sector. In the past  year,  unnoticed
and unheralded, 150 dispersed institutions, some good, some bad,  have  been
amalgamated  into  50  new   and   more   professional   further   education
institutions  headed  by  new  and  capable  leadership,   with   responsive
programmes which will ensure that students are  properly  equipped  for  the
world. We must double this in the next five years, from 120 000  till  there
is a quarter million of our young people attending these colleges.

Let me now turn  to  higher  education.  Just  under  R9  billion  has  been
allocated to higher education. This level of investment, as a percentage  of
GDP, is close to the OECD, the 30 richest countries in the  world.  This  is
an indication of the  importance  we  place  on  higher  education  and  its
contribution  to  the  social,  economic,  political  and   human   resource
developments in our country.

This development have been greatly helped by the National Student  Financial
Aid Scheme. This year, it will use R850 million in loans  and  bursaries  to
support students from the poorest communities  and  to  improve  their  life
chances by  being  able  to  access  the  opportunities  offered  by  higher
education study. Of this R850 million, I am  pleased  to  report  that  R210
million comes from repaid loans, an amount which will grow  annually.  Since
1994, a quarter of million of the poorest of our people,  including  whites,
Indians and coloureds, have been able to enter higher education.

I am also pleased to  report  that  our  transformation  and  reconstruction
agenda is unfolding  with  increasing  support  from  the  higher  education
sector. There are remaining merges. ML Sultan Technikon and Natal  Technikon
had their first year of celebration of the merger. The merger of the  QwaQwa
campus of the University of the North was incorporated into  the  University
of the Free State.

The remaining mergers and incorporations approved by  the  Cabinet  are  due
for  implementation  in  January  2004  and  2005,   supported   by   budget
provisioning for the restructuring. I have  also  this  week  constituted  a
reference group, some of  whom  are  here,  of  distinguished  persons  with
experience and knowledge of higher education to assist  me  to  monitor  the
restructuring processes and to try and ensure  that  our  policy  objectives
are not compromised by the mergers.
Before I leave the matter of higher education, I raise a point that  I  have
made. I owe this to the hon Dene Smuts.  I  referred  wrongly  to  the  Vice
Chancellor receiving a white envelope with white powder. It was one  of  the
Pro Vice Chancellors, Prof Botman. There is  a  special  resonance,  if  you
know who Prof Botman is, but he is the one who received the envelope.

Members will be pleased to hear that a new framework policy for language  in
higher education including indigenous languages has received wide  approval,
notwithstanding some highly inflammatory insults  and  abuse  aimed  at  the
Government and to this  Minister.  Universities  and  technikons  have  been
revising their own language policies to ensure that these are in  line  with
the national framework. I must thank them for their efforts in this  regard.
This is the ANC in action, fulfilling its mandate for the reconstruction  of
our country.

One of the most significant investigations carried out by the Department  of
Education to date has been the cost of education study, which  is  currently
open for public comment. The report identified, firstly, key ways  in  which
we could enhance the  system  more  or  less  within  current  budgets  and,
secondly, where budgetary shifts are vital for improving  the  situation  in
our public schools.

We have, of course, to make sure that schools get their  textbooks  and  the
stationery they have ordered on time. Engagement between the Government  and
the textbook and clothing industries will assist in  countering  inefficient
odering  processes,  and  monopoly  situations  that  push  up  prices   and
compromise our provisioning of resources  to  students.  Textbook  cost  and
retrieval is something that we will be paying special  attention  to  during
the current year. I should add that the MTEF  budget  for  this  year  makes
provision for nearly R2 billion to spent on learning  materials  and  school
laboratories, an enormous increase from R350 million just four years ago.

We will also be taking stronger  action  against  those  who  disregard  the
basic human rights and dignity of students,  and  particularly  orphans.  We
will act against  those  principals,  teachers  and  governing  bodies  that
marginalise children whose parents cannot afford  to  pay  school  fees  and
other fees.

We should be improving the  way  in  which  we  target  the  poor  with  our
substantial infrastructure budgets, which have increased from  R600  million
to over R3 billion in just three years for school building and  maintenance,
water, sanitation, and electrifiction to add to the  many  billions  already
spent in these areas since 1994.

Two critical areas requiring healthier budgets are  the  school  allocations
in terms of school funding norms  and  school  feeding  schemes.  Under  our
studies, it is quite  clear  that  the  poorest  are  not  getting  adequate
resources per head for their schools. Currently, we are in  discussion  with
National Treasury for an approach to funding schools which  recognises  that
provinces are not equally poor or rich as well as the  differing  status  of
schools. We want a national norm that will apply throughout the country,  so
there will not be deficiencies in the costing and payment  for  children  in
the Northern Province or Limpopo compared to the Western Cape.

As far as  the  integrated  nutrition  programme  serving  young  pupils  is
concerned, this has increased to R800 million in the current  year,  and  is
set to increase to over R1 billion in the current  MTEF.  All  poor  primary
schools must  receive  their  nutrition  from  this  programme.  The  entire
administration and the  budget  are  to  be  transferred  to  the  education
departments in the next financial year, and this fact underlines  the  needs
for very careful planning.

Over the past year, the education response to HIV/Aids has gained  momentum.
The education sector has assumed its role  at  the  heart  of  the  national
response to HIV/Aids, in the process of reflecting the commitments  made  in
a very important conference that  we  held  last  year  on  the  prevalence,
effect and impact of HIV/Aids in the education sector.

I should add also, of course, that one of the great triumphs  has  been  the
work of Takalani Sesame, and let us not forget  Kami,  the  puppet  who  has
been accorded the status of an Aids ambassador for the UN.  I  am  delighted
that I can announce today that last week, Takalani Sesame was the winner  of
the Grand Prix award, the highest form of recognition for the media, at  the
World Media Festival in Germany. [Applause.] My compliments to the SABC  and
Sanlam, the principle sponsor involved in the  enterprise,  for  this  major
achievement. [Applause.]

Many members are not aware of the enormous changes that have taken place  in
education in our country, the spirit  and  the  content.  We  are  not,  and
cannot be, prisoners of either our past or  our  prejudices.  To  illustrate
that education is not being  ``dumbed  down''  -  this  is  a  terrible  and
offensive phrase used by our journalists - I have detailed just some of  our
more significant achievements.

We can rejoice in the wonderful diversity of our nation,  and  at  the  same
time, celebrate our unity and pursuit of nation-building. Our  draft  policy
on religion in education is such a  case,  where  people  have  confused  an
attempt to promote nation-building and celebrate  diversity  in  the  school
context with an attack on religious freedom and diversity. This is  not  the
case. We are not expelling or banning religion from  schools.  In  fact,  if
you  look  at  the  programme,  we  are  advocating  the  strengthening  and
recognition of the role of religion in education.

On Monday, I will be meeting with the National Forum of Religious Leaders  -
you couldn't go higher than that, because it was convened by  the  President
- to discuss the draft policy with them, and to seek their views on  how  we
can best fulfil our constitutional obligations.
Let me say to this House that everything we have done up  to  now  has  been
the result of close collaboration with the National Standing  Advisory  Body
on Religion  in  Education,  representing  all  the  religious  faiths,  but
largely the Protestant faith, because  they  are  in  the  majority  in  our
country. Everything we have done has  been  the  result  of  an  interesting
interaction between government department and the  national  advisory  body,
which I am told, by the way, by educationists, is the  first  such  body  in
the world.

They say you can give children two things: Roots and wings;  roots  to  hold
them to the ground, to their heritage, to their family,  and  the  wings  to
fly beyond all of these, beyond our expectations and current possibilities.

In establishing a national system of education, we  are  beginning  to  till
and prepare a fertile soil  for  the  roots  of  our  children  to  develop.
Whatever their circumstance, the souls of the children of South  Africa  are
at last fed by the same soil, nurtured within  a  common  state,  and  their
roots will inevitably be intertwined. We are developing South  Africans.  We
are trying to ensure that their roots are strong  enough  to  bind  them  to
this wonderful land.

Our young people are beginning to dream again. In  one  classroom  recently,
young people were asked to emulate Martin Luther King's ``I have  a  dream''
speech, and one child wrote:


  I have a dream that blacks and whites should love and trust  one  another
  as brothers and sisters. We have brown skins - they have white skins.  We
  are different in colour but we have to same colour of blood. We  are  the
  same but not in colour. I wish we can respect one another. I wish we  can
  all be equal because we are all human beings.

It may be an oversimplification, but there is a  truth  emerging  from  this
extraordinary dream of young people.

Before I conclude, I want to thank the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Education;
the provincial  MECs  for  education  in  the  provinces  who  are  here  in
strength; the teachers, the managers and other staff; higher  education  and
other educational institutions, including many  NGOs  and,  of  course,  our
associated  family  in  education,  such  as  the  SA  Council  For   Higher
Education; the SA Qualification Authority; Umalusi, the  accreditation  body
for examinations, and of course, the National Financial Aids Scheme who  are
represented here today for their hard work in  ensuring  that  South  Africa
continues to learn. Without all your efforts, there would be  no  meaningful
educational development in this country.

In particular, our relationship with the private sector has  brought  in  so
much value, not only for the  national  business  initiative,  but  for  the
private businessmen and  women  who  are  here  and  who  are  putting  into
education quietly, undramatically, what they think the schools deserve.

During my current term of office, we have worked  collectively  in  managing
the work of the Department of Education and the Ministry. I would  therefore
like to record my gratitude and appreciation  to  the  Director-General,  Mr
Thami Mseleku - you can't miss him - and all his staff who have  contributed
so much and have  often  gone  beyond  the  call  of  duty  to  ensure  that
education is normalised and improved in South Africa. We also bid  farewell,
unfortunately - lost to  another  government  department  -  to  our  Deputy
Director-General for Monitoring and Planning, Mr Bobby  Soobrayan,  who  has
played such an important part in the cost of education  study  that  he,  in
fact, brought out last December.

I would also like to thank my personal office staff  -  some  of  whom  have
been with me, remarkably, through most  of  the  last  nine  years  of  this
Government - for their commitment, dedication and loyalty.  Thank  you  also
to the various organisations who  provided  assistance  for  today's  Budget
Vote events, to which you are invited at 5:30.

It is appropriate to end with a quotation from one of South  Africa's  great
philosophers, and in doing so, dedicate my contribution,  again,  to  Walter
Sisulu. With wisdom beyond his age and time, Steven Bantu Biko wrote:


  We reject the power-based society that seems to be  ever  more  concerned
  with perfecting their technological know-how, while losing out  on  their
  spiritual dimension. We believe that in the  long  run,  the  great  gift
  still has to come from Africa, giving the world a more human face.

Education is helping to create that gift, and we join with all  Africans  in
the giving of the great gift.

I therefore commend Budget Vote No 15 for your  approval.  Siyabonga.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr W P DOMAN: Hon Deputy Speaker, the DA congratulates the Minister  on  the
quantitative progress that has been  made  in  education.  Access  has  been
opened  up  to  all,  the  provision  of  school  infrastructure  has   been
accelerated, unified administrations  have  been  set  up  and  the  maximum
budget possible has been secured. We also welcome the initiatives  announced
by the Minister today. The development of teachers will be very important.

In  Parliament  the  Minister  is  always  available  and  ready  to  answer
questions and engage in  debate.  He  understands  the  cut  and  thrust  of
debate. He is clever - if he cannot convince you  he  will  try  to  confuse
you. [Laughter.]

We, however, on the DA side have significant problems with  the  quality  of
much of the education that  is  delivered.  It  should  be  noted  that  our
concerns  are  increasingly  being  reflected  in  official  documents.  For
instance, in the Minister's recent review of the financing,  resourcing  and
costs of education in public schools we find the following on page 101:
  There is considerable evidence indicating that quality  of  education  in
  South African schools is worryingly low, relative to  what  South  Africa
  spends on education.

The review then, of course, blames much of this  on  the  history  of  South
Africa. While we have a  great  understanding  of  the  huge  backlogs  that
existed, I must point out to the  Minister  that  many  of  the  qualitative
shortcomings of education in South Africa are demonstrated by  learners  who
entered formal schooling after 1994.  Could  this  be  the  result  of  poor
policies and poor implementation, post-1994,  from  a  department  that  has
increased significantly in size in the past few years with the  creation  of
all sorts of directorates  -  for  example  one  for  human  rights  in  the
curriculum?

However, what is the quality of the roll-out? Let's examine a few  examples.
The new curriculum for Grade R to Grade 3 kicks in next year. We are now  in
mid-May and, with the exception of one province, there has been no  training
of teachers in the revised curriculum to  teach  this  important  phase.  In
fact, my information is that the Teacher's  Guide  for  the  Development  of
Learning Programmes, on which all teacher training must  be  based,  is  not
yet available to teachers.

The success of this training becomes doubly important when we  realise  that
there has been little, if any, testing or piloting as some form  of  quality
control. A systemic evaluation of the literacy and  numeracy  competency  of
learners at Grade 3 level was, however, conducted some time ago. Why is  the
Minister so hesitant to publicly release these results? Is  he  afraid  that
this will  indicate  the  failure  of  outcomes-based  education  as  it  is
implemented at present?  It  is  alleged  that  the  literacy  and  numeracy
competencies across the board are only within  the  30%  range.  That  would
represent a disturbing drop.

The third international mathematics and science study placed South Africa  -
which was 48th out of 50 countries -  now  in  the  last  position.  Another
example: The Minister had the sense to delay the  implementation  of  a  new
Further Education and Training, FET, curriculum from 2004 to 2006.  However,
the subjects to be  offered  are  already  known.  Some  of  these  are  new
subjects and, in  order  to  prepare  teachers  by  2006,  universities  and
colleges should already have known what the new curriculum  would  entail  -
both in form and in content. Nothing final has been forthcoming, so they  do
not know for what they should prepare their students.

Apart from the documented need to train 20 000 teachers a year for the  next
few years, does the department know how many teachers are in  training,  how
many of these are South African, and how many will be  needed  in  different
subjects for the new FET curriculum?

In die Wes-Kaap is bevind dat slegs  40%  van  die  toetreders  in  Graad  1
uiteindelik matriek slaag. Is dit nie 'n geval dat die ander  60%  deur  die
kurrikulum in die steek gelaat  word  omdat  dit  té  akademies  en  net  op
toegang tot hoër onderwys gerig is nie? Die uitdaging vir  die  Minister  se
department is om die kurrikulum relevant te maak vir toegang  tot  werk.  In
Duitsland word net 20% van leerders opgelei vir hoër onderwys en  die  ander
80% vir beroepsonderwys. Dit is wat ons ekonomie ook  verlang.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In the Western Cape it has been found that only  40%  of  the  entrants  to
Grade 1 eventually pass matric. Is it not a case of the other 60% being  let
down by the curriculum because it is too academic and only aimed  at  access
to higher education? The challenge to the Minister's department is  to  make
the curriculum relevant for access to work.  In  Germany  only  20%  of  the
learners are being trained for  higher  education  and  the  other  80%  for
vocational education. This is also what our economy requires.]

The plan to outlaw additional remuneration and  perks  by  school  governing
bodies for excellent and hard-to-replace teachers will lead to an exodus  of
good teachers from the public education system. This plan may  appear  as  a
convincing argument for equality across all schools, and that is  the  issue
which the Minister  is  driving  -  equality.  However,  we  must  warn  the
Minister that the poorest schools are going to  suffer  the  most,  as  they
will be stripped of their best  teachers  who  will  just  move  to  greener
pastures within the system. We view this proposal as an attack on  the  poor
as well. This reminds me of what Ngujen Ko Thack, the  foreign  Minister  of
Vietnam, said in 1982  of  the  communist  regime:  ``We  were  not  without
success. We managed to spread poverty evenly.''

It is clearly documented in the  School  Finance  Review  that  hundreds  of
millions of rand of private money is  drawn  into  public  education,  which
frees  money  for   redress.   Everyone   benefits,   including   the   many
disadvantaged children who attend so-called advantaged schools.  As  the  DA
we applaud the efforts, skills and time  of  governing  bodies  and  parents
made available in the spirit of volunteerism in the interests of  their  own
and other children.

Only last week the Minister issued a statement to call on  parents  to  take
part in the upcoming school  governing  body  elections,  which  he  rightly
referred to as the third biggest democratic elections in  the  country.  But
what a smack in the face this Government gives them  by  not  trusting  them
with  the  most  important  matter  to  them,  namely  the  appointment  and
retention of quality teachers for their  children.  This  Government  thanks
them by eroding their autonomy.

Now the Government is also planning to ban any  religious  observances  from
the official business of schools.  I  heard  what  the  Minister  said  this
afternoon. However, if he frames one of his rules  in  terms  of  not  being
allowed in the official business of schools, it is made impossible  for  the
governing bodies to allow this at all at school during school  hours.  This,
apart from other policies of the Minister, clearly indicates  that  learners
are viewed - I am afraid it seems so - as the property  of  the  state,  the
teachers as his master's voice and governing bodies not as partners, but  as
state agents. This violates everything we find in the various  White  Papers
issued by the same Ministry. We  say:  Trust  governing  bodies  with  these
important matters.

Mr Minister, if there is a flat tyre you  are  aware  of,  fix  it;  do  not
deflate all the others. I never thought that I would say  this,  but  follow
the example of the Minister of Health. Last week  she  announced  incentives
to retain doctors. You should do the same as far as teachers are concerned.

Ek wil na 'n uiters belangrike saak verwys, naamlik  dat  die  Minister  nog
nie die Nasionale Onderwysraad se lede benoem het nie. Die Huis moet  kennis
neem dat  volgens  die  Minister  se  eie  wegewing  hy  daardie  raad  moet
raadpleeg oor alle beleide voordat hy dit uitvaardig. Ek  wil  die  Minister
beskuldig dat hy hierdie bepaling omseil. Geen wonder hy kom baie  keer  met
ondeurdagte beleid nie. Geen wonder hy het die  saak  ten  opsigte  van  die
minimum toelatingsouderdom van kinders tot skole in  die  hof  verloor  nie.
Dit sal ook geen wonder wees as al sy beleide sedert  1996  ongeldig  bevind
word weens hierdie versuim nie.

Ek dink in elk geval onderwys word dikwels oorlaai met  allerhande  beleide.
Op die ou end beland daardie beleide op die lessenaar van die  skoolhoof  en
die personeel, wat dit moet uitvoer. Onderwys kan nie alles regmaak  wat  in
die samelewing verkeerd is nie en ons sal baie versigtig moet wees hiermee.

Wat hoër onderwys betref, is dit vir ons baie belangrik om the hoor wat  die
kwantifisering van die poste vir die inkorporering en amalgamering  is,  wie
dit gaan dra en of solvente inrigtings ook insolvente  inrigtings  sal  moet
dra.

Ons is bekommerd dat onderrig se gehalte kan ly weens die  ekstra  take  wat
op die bestuurslede en raadslede geplaas  word.  Die  Minister  het  verlede
jaar erken 'n spesifieke inheemse taal sal nie gedy sonder 'n  taalstoel  by
'n universiteit nie. Ons stem  saam  en  ons  wag  op  inisiatiewe  van  die
departement sodat PANsat se aanbevelings in hierdie  verband  ook  uitgevoer
kan word. Ontbreek die politieke wil by die Minister om dit te doen?

Om hierdie redes kan ons ongelukkig nie  hierdie  begrotingspos  steun  nie.
[Tyd verstreke.] [Applous.] (Translation of Arikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I want to refer to an extremely important matter, namely that the  Minister
has not yet appointed the members of the  National  Education  Council.  The
House should note that according to the Minister's own  legislation  he  has
to consult that council about all policies prior to issuing them. I want  to
accuse the Minister of circumventing  this  provision.  No  wonder  that  he
often comes up with ill-considered policies. No  wonder  that  he  lost  the
case regarding the minimum school entry age for children in court.  It  will
also be no wonder if all of his  policies,  since  1996,  are  found  to  be
invalid because of this failure.

I think, in any case, that education is often overloaded with all  sorts  of
policies. In the end those policies land on the desk of  the  principal  and
staff who have to implement it. Education  cannot  fix  everything  that  is
wrong in society, and we will have to be very careful with this.

With regard to higher education, it is very important that we hear what  the
quantification of the posts is  for  incorporating  and  merging,  who  will
carry  it,  and  whether  solvent  institutions  will  also  have  to  carry
insolvent institutions.

We are concerned that the quality of education might suffer as a  result  of
these  additional  tasks  that  are  being  entrusted  to  the  members   of
management and council. Last year the Minister acknowledged that a  specific
indigenous language will not  flourish  unless  it  is  represented  in  the
language department of a  university.  We  agree,  and  we  are  waiting  on
initiatives from the department so that PANsalb's  recommendations  in  this
regard can also be implemented. Is there a lack of  political  will  on  the
side of the Minister to do this?

Unfortunately for these reasons we can not support this Budget  Vote.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]]

Prof  S  M  MAYATULA:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  Deputy  President,  hon
Ministers, Deputy Ministers, colleagues, invited guests,  before  addressing
you on the topic at hand, I would like to give a special welcome to  one  of
the team members who will take the podium as a member of  the  ANC  for  the
first time today. I'm referring to a newborn baby in the person  of  Comrade
Tommy Abrahams. He  has  left  the  shackles  of  the  UDM  and  joined  the
camaraderie and the free spirit of the ANC. [Applause.] He  is  now  a  free
man indeed. Welcome home, comrade!

I'd also like the House to think about hon Mahlawe, who  was  billed  to  be
one of the speakers today. Unfortunately, her house in  Kokstad  burnt  down
to ashes last Saturday. Fortunately, nobody was  hurt.  Though  traumatised,
her heart is with us. She  even  phoned  me  just  after  one  o'clock  this
afternoon.

I can only add a word of appreciation  to  the  Minister  for  inviting  the
farmers from the Free State, because  they  really  made  an  impression  on
those members of the committee who visited that part  of  the  country.  For
them I'd like to borrow words of wisdom from Henry Ward Beecher,  who  said,
and I quote:


  There was never a person who  did  anything  worth  doing  that  did  not
  receive more than he gave.

I hope the Lord will bless you even more.

From the 11th to the 14th of this month  I  was  privileged  to  attend  the
Stockholm Plus Five Conference, hosted by the  Swedish  National  Commission
for Unesco, on cultural policies for development. What made me proud  to  be
a South African was the constant reference  to  South  Africa,  the  rainbow
nation, by many speakers  as  a  shining  light  to  be  followed  by  other
countries. Some faced with the problem of child abuse at schools would  like
to emulate us and establish their own statutory bodies like the  SA  Council
for Educators.

South Africa is part of the African continent. As such  we  need  to  relate
its plans and programmes to  those  of  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's
Development, Nepad. Nepad's main  goal  is  to  ensure  that  the  continent
achieves the agreed international development  goals,  which  are:  one,  to
reduce the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by half  by  2015;
two, to enrol all children of school age in primary schools by 2015;  three,
to  make  progress  towards  gender  equality  and   empowering   women   by
eliminating  gender  disparities  in  enrolment  in  primary  and  secondary
education by 2005; four, to reduce infant and child mortality rates  by  two
thirds by 2015; five, to reduce maternal mortality rates by  three  quarters
by 2015; and six, to provide access  for  all  who  need  protective  health
services by 2015.

On the world front, at the World Education Forum  held  in  Dakar  in  April
2000, the objectives were stated as follows: one,  expanding  and  improving
comprehensive early childhood care and education, especially  for  the  most
vulnerable and disadvantaged  children;  two,  ensuring  that  by  2015  all
children,  particularly  girls,  in  difficult   circumstances   and   those
belonging to  ethnic  minorities  have  access  to  and  complete  free  and
compulsory education of good quality; three, to ensure that  learning  needs
of all young people and adults are met through  equitable  access  to  basic
and continuing education for all, achieving a 50% improvement in  levels  of
adult literacy by 2015; four, eliminating gender disparities in primary  and
secondary education by 2005; and five, improving all aspects of the  quality
of education  and  ensuring  excellence  for  all  so  that  recognised  and
measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all.

I'm happy to report that according to Unesco,  South  Africa  falls  in  the
category of those ``countries that have almost achieved the target, or  that
need to do moderate efforts''.

According  to  the  statistical  document,  Minute  F8:  Universal   Primary
Education Goal for All, on the access rate to Grade 6 in  2000,  out  of  45
African countries South Africa  achieved  94%,  which  was  second  only  to
Botswana, which achieved 98%. The secondary education gross  enrolment  rate
in 2000 was 90%, and we were second only to Mauritius.

The Tirisano programme of the department was meant to address these  issues.
My colleagues will expand on some of these areas to  illustrate  the  ground
this  ANC-led  Government  has   covered   in   addressing   them.   Notable
achievements include improved access, as reflected in the  sharp  growth  in
enrolment figures. These peaked at a historical high  of  in  access  of  12
million in 2002; improved learner-educator ratios, in  some  instances  from
40:1  to  32:1  in  2002;  enhanced  efficiency  by  curtailing   out-of-age
enrolments; a more equitable distribution of resources within  this  sector;
strengthening of parent and community involvement  through  school-governing
bodies; the successful transition from 17 departments to  a  unified  system
of  school  education  under  the  auspices  of  the  nine  provinces;   and
accelerated provision of infrastructure, which was  reinforced  through  the
school-building programme.

Ndivumele, Somlomo, ndithethe isiXhosa.

Emva kokuba uRhulumente ezithabathile iintambo  zolawulo  ngo-1994,  zininzi
izikolo ezakhiwa ezilalini. Yaba  kokokuqala  ukuba  abantu  babone  izikolo
zabo zakhiwe ngezitena ze-face brick, namatanki  amanzi  kwanombane.  Babona
izinto ngezinto ababengazange bazibone ngaphambili,  abanye  bade  bangafuni
kukholelwa ukuba le nto iyenzeka.

Kambe nangona  kunjalo,  kufuneka  sivume  ukuba  ngenxa  yengxaki  yezikolo
ezininzi ezingekakhiwa, sisenomgama omde ekufuneka siwuhambile.  Ndikhumbula
isikolo saseNaki eDutywa, esimke namanzi kulo  nyaka  uphelileyo.  Abantwana
njengokuba ndithetha nje bafundela ezindlwini zabantu.

Esase-Hermanus isikolo, kwaphaya eDutywa, naso semka  namanzi  ngonyaka  ka-
1997, kodwa asikakhiwa njengokuba  ndithetha  nje.  Kanti  izikolo  ezininzi
azinazo  izindlu  zangasese.  Kufuneka  uvale  amehlo  xa  ubona   abantwana
abangamantombazana bethe dwadwalala ethafeni  ngexesha  lekhefu.  Kambe  ke,
njengokuba ebetshilo uMongameli, uRhulumente uzimisele ukuzijika  ezi  meko.
Ngoko abo bakwezi ngxaki mabangalahl' ithemba.

Ezinye zezinto athe lo Rhulumente wazenza, ukubonisa ukuba xa  sisithi  siya
kuzenza  izinto  siya  kuzibekela  nemali   yokuzenza,   zezi   zilandelayo:
(Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Prof S M MAYATULA: Madam Speaker, please would  you  allow  me  to  address
myself in isiXhosa.

After the new Government took control in 1994, a lot of schools  were  built
in rural areas. It was for the first time  that  people  saw  schools  built
with face brick, that have water tanks and electricity. They started  seeing
things they never saw before,  some  would  not  believe  that  really  such
things are happening.

Even though it is so, we must accept that because  there  are  still  a  big
number of schools that still need to build, we still have a long way to  go.
Just now I am reminded of a school at Naki in Idutywa that was destroyed  by
heavy rains last year. Learners of that school are placed  in  people\rquote
s homes at the moment. Another one at Hermanus still  in  Idutywa  was  also
destroyed by heavy rains in 1997, but has still not  been  built  yet.  Many
schools do not have toilets. You feel like closing your eyes  when  you  see
girls relieving themselves in the open fields during  breaks.  But,  as  the
hon the President has said, the Government is committed  to  changing  these
conditions. Therefore, those that are faced  with  these  conditions  should
not lose hope.

Some of the things that this Government has succeeded  doing  as  a  way  of
showing that when we promise to do things we even allocated money for  them,
are the following:]

From 1996-97 to 2003-04 transfer payments  to  universities  and  technikons
increased from R4,9 billion to R8,9 billion. A  total  of  R100  million  of
this  will  have  something  to  do  with  the   restructuring   of   higher
institutions of education.

Xa ndisiya kwezabantwana,  ii-preschool,  uRhulumente  ubeke  ecaleni  imali
engange-R100 million. Ngale mali uRhulumente uzimisele ukuba kuwo  lo  nyaka
umiyo uza kuqeqesha ootitshala abangama-4 500. Izinto  zokudlala  zabantwana
kwezo-preschool ezingama-4 500 nazo ziza kuthengwa. Izikolo  ezingama-4  500
ziza kubhaliswa ukuze abantwana abancinci  nabo  baxhamle.  (Translation  of
Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Government has allocated an amount of R100 million  for  pre-schools.  With
this money Government is going to train 4  500  pre-school  teachers.  Games
for children in these pre-schools will be bought from that sum.  The  4  500
pre-schools are going to be registered so that small  children  can  benefit
too.]

An amount of R13 414 000, representing an increase of R10 million, has  been
made available to improve financial management in the education  system  and
to enhance the quality of education in  schools.  The  Ikhwelo  Project  has
been  allocated  R50 million,  an  increase  of  R10  million.  This  is  an
expansion of the Department of  Education's  agriculture  and  SMME  pilots.
This is what we refer to as literally  trying  to  fight  back  against  the
problem of poverty in our country.

The Sithuba Makote Project has been allocated R64 million,  an  increase  of
R30 million, and will be used for building 20 schools in our provinces.

The MTEF spending includes  R1,7  billion  more  for  higher  education  and
further skills development funding.

Now I come to some important policy considerations of  the  department.  The
draft  White  Paper  on  e-education  envisages  that  every  South  African
learner, all 12 million of  them,  in  general  and  further  education  and
training will be ICT-capable by 2030. All 28  000  schools  in  general  and
further education and training must transform into e-schools by 2030.

Regarding guns, the department has decided that our schools should  be  gun-
free zones. For sporting purposes, it is envisaged that the schools will  be
using air guns, which are created specifically for this sport.

On smoking, the department and the Government say  that  this  is  one  area
that our kids should not go into. Smoking is a slow poison.  Smoking  kills.
I'd like to make a special appeal to the youth: Please, do not  start.  This
is not happening only in our country,  but  worldwide,  because  smoking  is
habitual and it's a killer.

The mood and the status of the  reconstruction  of  institutions  of  higher
learning is summed up in the following statement  by  Prof  Dasaraj  Chetty,
and I quote:


  The Universities of Durban-Westville  and  Natal  are  set  to  merge  in
  January. As a result, an institution with five campus sites catering  for
  40 000 students, with all faculties, will be created.

The same spirit prevails on other campuses.

On the department's side, the Ministry is committed  to  ensuring  that  the
appropriate human and financial resources are leveraged and that  mechanisms
are put in place to support the mergers. In this regard a  merger  unit  has
been established within the higher education section of  the  department  to
manage the merger process.

Among other things, the merger unit will assess and make recommendations  on
requests  from  institutions  for  financial  assistance  in  terms  of  the
Ministry's framework for financial support,  including  requests  to  employ
independent consultants to carry out specific tasks in relation to  mergers,
such as audits of physical assets and infrastructure, identifying legal  and
financial obligations, and many others.

I would like to take this  time  to  thank  the  members  of  the  portfolio
committee. We have been working together well as  a  team,  irrespective  of
parties, in order to drive this important  programme  of  education  in  our
country.

I'd also like to thank the Minister  and  officials  of  the  Department  of
Education, because whenever we call on them, they are ready to  respond  and
assist us. Though our responsibility is that of oversight, we don't have  to
be enemies to do that, because we have one goal. I appreciate that.  As  the
ANC, we want to support this Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  A  M  MPONTSHANE:  Ngiyabona  mhlonishwa,  Somlomo.  Mhlonishwa   Sekela
Mongameli Msholozi, Ngqongqoshe wezeMfundo, ozakwethu ... [Thank you,  Madam
Deputy Speaker. Hon Deputy President Msholozi,  Minister  of  Education  and
colleagues ...]

... the debate on the Education Vote is not just a debate  about  education,
but a debate about the transformation process itself. Because  it  is  about
transformation, the debate is bound to generate different views  about  what
needs to be done, when and how.

We come from a terribly painful past, where the majority of our people  were
denied  equality  of  opportunities  in  many  spheres  of  life,  including
education. It is proper that right from the beginning I give credit to  both
Ministers who, since 1994, have achieved a lot in the transformation of  the
hitherto fragmented system  of  education.  No  child  can  now  be  refused
entrance to a public school because of his or  her  accident  of  birth.  No
child can now be refused entrance to any public school  on  the  grounds  of
nonpayment of school fees. This is at least true in theory.

The report by the Human Rights Commission concluded  that  racism  in  South
African schools and universities was flourishing. Of course, we  must  admit
that there are no quick fixes. In certain instances,  racial  discrimination
is being replaced by social class discrimination.

Governing bodies can set  school  fees  which  are  prohibitively  high,  to
disallow entrance to public schools by learners from  poor  backgrounds.  We
welcome the fact  that  the  hon  Minister  has  set  up  a  Funding  Review
Committee which has made its proposals  public.  We  also  welcome  the  hon
Minister's intention to set up a monitoring section within  his  department.
The gulf between education standards in previously white and  black  schools
is still very, very wide.

School governing bodies can set school fees and raise  additional  money  to
top up state funding. Whilst this is a good thing, on the other hand it  can
and does in  fact  perpetuate  inequalities.  Until  black  communities  are
empowered, both socially and economically, these  inequalities  will  remain
with us for a long time to come. However, it is self-destructive to  try  to
tear down the rich in order to empower the poor. Let us  try  to  raise  the
standards of our poor communities.

We still need more classrooms, and better trained  teachers,  especially  in
rural areas. In this regard one  must  commend  the  Japanese-South  African
agreement on the basis of which about  365  classrooms  were  built  in  the
Ingwavuma district alone. We  applaud  this  effort  by  the  Department  of
Education.

Much more, as I have said, still  needs  to  be  done.  In  my  office,  for
instance, I have a pile of letters  from  principals  whose  learners  still
learn under trees. I am saying this,  being  aware  of  the  fact  that  the
building of classrooms is a provincial competence, but the  national  budget
does have important  implications  for  provincial  budgets.  About  90%  of
provincial  budgets  go  to  personnel  expenditure.  We  must  commend  the
department for its decision to continue its  support  to  provinces  through
conditional grants, at least for this current financial year, because  these
conditional grants  do  help  provinces  in  fulfilling  other  departmental
responsibilities.

I have always been puzzled by the number of  newly  qualified  teachers  who
cannot be absorbed by our system, whilst some teachers have to  handle  more
learners than the officially recognised learner-educator ratio. Perhaps  now
is the  time  to  visit  the  provincial  provisioning  norms  in  order  to
alleviate this problem.

The greatest chunk of this year's budget goes to the institutions of  higher
learning, the National Student Financial Aid  Scheme  and  the  CHE  through
transfer payments. This  is  in  line  with  the  proposals  of  the  Higher
Education Plan. We have to increase  our  skills  base,  especially  in  the
fields of commerce, science and mathematics.

We are, however, concerned about the  way  in  which  the  National  Student
Financial Aid Scheme is currently being handled. It  is  sometimes  used  to
buy certain favours from a particular gender of the  university  population,
and this has led to widespread corruption. Corruption has become the  cancer
which continues to eat deep into our system. There  are  those  who  in  the
past have leaked examination papers to learners for some  kind  of  payment.
Others have bribed their way into leadership  positions  because  they  were
politically  well  connected,  even  though  they   lacked   the   necessary
qualifications to be there. In some instances money has been paid  to  ghost
teachers and managers. These are all forms of corruption which must  not  be
supported.  Corruption  breeds  incompetence  and  leads  to  some  form  of
political decay. The system  in  turn  becomes  dysfunctional.  Delivery  of
services then suffers.

We have not yet arrived. We  still  face  some  problems  in  our  education
system. The Funding Review Committee noted quite recently that some  of  the
problems  are  caused  by  policy  mistakes  and  others   are   caused   by
inappropriate implementation.

We have always supported the transformation of  our  education  system.  But
transformation is not a neutral process. The present  Government,  the  ANC-
led Government, must and does have a tranformation agenda which informs  its
policy choices. Writing in 1993, in a document  entitled  ``The  ANC  Inside
and Outside of the New Parliament'', the ANC had this to say:


  When we elect representatives to Parliament we will expect them  to  make
  major contributions  in  developing  the  new  Constitution  and  helping
  develop legislation that will transform South Africa  into  a  democratic
  state and reconstruct it socially and economically.

It may be argued that the only transformation agenda is the  democratisation
of the system. We cannot fool ourselves into believing that  there  is  only
one brand of democracy. We acknowledge the fact  that  some  of  the  policy
mistakes have arisen because of the pressure to redesign the whole society.

The introduction, for instance,  of  outcomes-based  education  was  a  good
thing. We needed to shift from the banking  type  of  education,  where  the
teacher deposited all the knowledge into a passive, uncritical  young  mind,
a mind which  was  expected  to  reproduce  exactly  what  the  teacher  had
deposited, sometimes much more than what the teacher himself had deposited.

We needed a paradigm shift. But Curriculum 2005, which is part of  OBE,  was
introduced without having prepared the  ground.  The  hon  Minister  had  to
intervene. The result was a simplified version of Curriculum  2005.  But  in
spite of the Minister's intervention, Curriculum 2005  is  still  not  being
taught effectively. Because of the lack of  resources  which  are  necessary
for the implementation of Curriculum 2005, teachers resort to  the  old  way
of teaching. Who can blame them? Is it not true that  one  cannot  pour  new
wine into old vessels?

Some of the Minister's policy choices are problematic. We are  uneasy  about
the transfer payments to what is called ...

... ngiyaxolisa Msholozi ukukubiza ngegama ...  [I  apologise  Msholozi  for
calling you by your name ...]

...  the  Jacob  Zuma  Trust  Fund  for  parents  of  schoolgoing   children
identified through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The  IFP  is  on
record for having opposed some of the distorted findings of the  commission,
which included the question of who was  the  perpetrator  and  who  was  the
victim. How do we explain this to those victims who, for some  reason,  were
not identified by the TRC process, and who would not  be  entitled  to  such
advantages?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I regret your time has expired, hon member.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: The IFP, in spite of all this, does support  this  Budget
Vote. [Applause.]

Mrs M E OLCKERS:  Deputy  Speaker,  there  are  many  issues  pertaining  to
education in South Africa today that one could  discuss  in  a  debate  like
this, but owing to time constraints I will only cover  some  topical  issues
of the day - some good, some bad.

The first issue is the latest intention of the hon  Minister  to  amend  the
South African Schools Act by  outlawing  extra  remuneration  for  educators
employed by the state either in  money  or  in  kind  by  governing  bodies,
unless prior approval of the provincial  department  is  obtained.  However,
the hon Minister quoted  from  the  Schools  Act  yesterday  in  Parliament,
saying that this was already in the Act. So  how  confused  can  we  become?
This  is  so  often  the  problem  we  have  in  portfolio  committees  when
discussing draft Bills, because often we do not need new  Acts,  but  rather
proper monitoring and good management.

I was a guest on a phone-in programme on Radio 702 on Thursday evening  when
a headmaster of a poor school in a rural area called  in  to  say  that  his
governing body, consisting mainly of poor parents, decided  to  raise  funds
so that they could give three teachers R100 extra each  per  month,  because
they voluntarily teach extra classes on Monday and Wednesday afternoons  and
Saturday mornings.

This governing body sincerely wanted to thank those teachers in their  small
way for the extra work they put into  education.  These  teachers,  like  so
many others, have to travel to the schools at their own  expense,  and  they
give freely of their time. They have extra car  expenses  to  get  to  these
schools for the extra hours they work. The governing body  then  received  a
circular from its department stating that it was not  allowed  to  show  its
appreciation to these teachers.  This  is  a  case  in  point,  because  the
Minister maintains that it is only the rich schools that are able  to  thank
teachers in whatever way they see fit.

The department so often still speaks about Model C schools, while there  are
no Model C schools in our system. There are schools that  perform  well  and
there are schools which do not. That is the difference.

Many of the more affluent schools have sports  facilities,  libraries,  etc,
which were paid for by the extra efforts of the  governing  bodies  and  the
enthusiasm of good principals. Through the system of  adopt-a-school,  these
facilities are being made available to less privileged schools.  This  is  a
positive attitude towards nation-building, and the department now  wants  to
negatively influence the positive steps and attitudes  of  these  principals
and governing bodies. Hon Minister,  we  all  know  that  the  schools  that
perform in an exemplary way are usually run by good principals.
Why does the Government want to  suppress  excellence?  All  countries  need
excellence, because excellence has a snowball  effect.  South  Africa  needs
citizens of excellence to assist in, inter  alia,  creating  jobs.  We  need
innovative thinkers. Yes, we  must  level  the  playing  field  as  soon  as
possible, but we must not create new obstacles in the process. Our aim  must
be to be equal in excellence and not equal in mediocrity.

Democracy must be acknowledged at grass-roots level as  it  is  acknowledged
in the highest corridors of power. Democracy is  for  all  the  people,  not
only for the poor or the rich.

The governing body was democratically elected and they should decide on  the
ethos of the school.  We  must  remember  that  they  were  elected  by  the
parents. If the Minister persists with this issue,  then  I  would  like  to
know what is happening  with  teachers  who  are  earning  extra  income  by
becoming councillors and mayors of local government.

The Minister replied to a written question from the  New  NP  recently  that
there were five principals in KwaZulu-Natal and four  in  Limpopo  who  were
also mayors. Mpumalanga did not reply to this question, so  we  must  assume
that the provincial department does not know what their teachers are doing.

Furthermore, there are 75 principals who are  local  government  councillors
and 280 teachers who are councillors. Again, Mpumalanga  did  not  give  any
figures, so the numbers could, in fact, be bigger.

Have all these teachers been given permission to earn the extra  income  and
perform their council  duties  during  school  hours?  And  what  about  the
principals who are full-time mayors? When are they in their school offices?

While these people attend to their council duties with  extra  remuneration,
other teachers give of their time, effort and  petrol  for  free  and  incur
other expenses.  If  a  headmaster,  with  the  assistance  of  his  or  her
democratically  elected  governing  body,  wants  to   show   his   or   her
appreciation to these  teachers,  he  or  she  may  not  do  so  unless  the
department gives permission. This sounds like Alice in Wonderland.

How long will the governing bodies wait for the department  to  respond,  if
we are to believe what is happening in some provinces like the Eastern  Cape
for instance, where teachers often do not receive their salaries for  months
while other ghost teachers have been paid for years, and where only  30%  of
the education budget was spent in the previous year.

Another worrying issue is that  the  Easten  Cape  education  department  is
losing R5,3 million a day owing to teacher absenteeism. This means  that  of
the 74 000 teachers, 16 700 were absent during a  head  count  done  by  the
Auditor-General with the  assistance  of  the  provincial  department.  That
accounts for 23% of the teachers - almost a quarter  were  absent.  We  wish
the MEC of education in that province, Nomsa  Jajula,  well  with  the  huge
task of tracing these teachers and if they do, in fact, exist. We thank  the
Minister for sending an interim management team there to try to assist  with
the management.

Another worrying issue the Minister is driving at  the  moment  is  the  big
debate about religion in schools. According to a  world-renowned  expert  on
this issue and on human rights, Prof Johan van der Vyver, currently  at  the
School of Human Rights  at  Emory  University,  Atlanta,  and  who  is  also
involved in a research project about religious freedom  in  Trier,  Germany,
this is against the Constitution of South Africa and will not  stand  up  in
the Constitutional Court.

The teachers, who will have to teach religious  studies,  will  have  to  be
very well educated in all the religions they have to teach, and also  be  so
even-handed about this that their jobs will be made almost impossible. I  do
not think that even a minister of religion, after studying the  subject  for
six to eight years, would be able to know everything about  a  large  number
of religions. Where, then, will the teachers  come  from,  because  a  crash
course will not equip them for this post?

However, the New NP knows that  education  is  a  very  tough  portfolio  to
manage. There have also  been  huge  successes.  The  SA  National  Literacy
Iniative, a programme set up  by  the  Government  to  address  adult  basic
literacy, reached some 80 000 adults in 2001.

Project Literacy was established 30 years ago. It is  estimated  that  there
are 15 million South Africans who  are  illiterate.  There  is  therefore  a
massive task ahead for projects like this one.

The New NP wants  to  assure  the  Minister  of  our  understanding  of  his
difficult portfolio and we appeal to him to listen to  the  sincere  appeals
of and take note of the  assistance  offered  by  well-meaning  parents  and
teachers. We want to assist to build, not to break down.

Education has a way of creating its own  crises.  The  department  must  not
look for causes, which it can use to create artificial crises. They  have  a
way of presenting themselves daily, these  crises,  so  if  something  works
without a lot of trouble, leave well alone.

Thank you teachers of South Africa for continuing with the building  process
of our country and our children, with which you  keep  yourself  busy  while
the storms are breaking around your heads. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M P MENTOR: Madam Deputy Speaker, my speech today  is  dedicated  to  the
generations that came before us and to the children of South  Africa,  their
mothers and their caregivers.  Particularly,  I  want  to  remember  Comrade
Amanda Kwadi who hailed from Letlhabile and  was  a  sound  and  progressive
academic, a cadre for change.

My speech is based on the 8th clause of  the  Freedom  Charter,  which  says
that the doors of learning and culture shall be opened. It is also based  on
the ``Ready to Govern'' document of the ANC and on the UN Convention on  the
Rights of the Child.

I would like to thank the SA Democratic  Teachers'  Union,  because  on  the
front page of the calendars and diaries they gave educators this  year  they
gave a quote by Che Guevara:


  Let me say,  with  the  risk  of  appearing  ridiculous,  that  the  true
  revolutionary is guided by strong feelings of love. It is  impossible  to
  think of an authentic revolutionary without this quality.

This quality of love is what I would like to highlight as one  principle  we
must try to  inculcate  in  our  students,  in  those  who  are  within  our
institutions of learning. However, I would  like  to  declare  our  historic
mission and our historic perspective  on  education.  Suddenly,  after  Tata
Sisulu passed away, the media began to argue that this was  the  end  of  an
era. They said so many things, for instance that there would be nobody  else
as dedicated, diligent and committed  as  the  generation  of  Comrade  Tata
Sisulu.

Now, firstly, I want to salute that  generation,  the  generation  of  Anton
Lembede, Comrade Nelson Mandela, O R Tambo, Govan  Mbeki,  Tata  Sisulu  and
others. Even before that generation, the ANC had already laid a  foundation,
a succession plan and a vision for  education  through  the  likes  of  Z  K
Matthews and others. So, I do not think that we are at a  crisis  point.  We
must ask right now: What  is  the  historic  mission,  the  objective,  that
education must achieve to fulfil the mission that we laid  down  many  years
ago?

After the generation that was the founder generation of  the  Youth  League,
there came the generation of  the  Luthuli  detachment,  the  generation  of
Chris Hani and Stanley Mabizela, the generation of Comrade Thabo Mbeki,  Max
Sisulu, Welile Nhlapo, Barney Pityana and others. Firstly,  again,  we  laid
the foundation, through that generation, for an  alternative  education  and
for better education for South Africa.

After that generation, the June 16 detachment and the youth section  of  the
ANC continued, together with  the  Monkhada  detachment  -  Comrade  Bachana
Mokoena who is no more, Comrade Jackie Selebi, Billy Masetlha,  Puso  Tladi,
Lyndall Shope-Mafole and others.

Consciously, the ANC impressed on them the  need  to  prepare  the  way  for
governing South Africa, putting the  issue  of  education  central  to  that
preparation.  Hence,  the  people  of  the  world,  such  as   the   Swedes,
contributed to the  development  of  this  detachment,  preparing  them  for
service excellence. It is no mistake that they  are  now  the  very  shining
directors-general of our departments.

After that there came the generation of the '80s, the  generation  of  Peter
Mokaba, Fawcett Mathebe and Parks Mankahlana. So the  baton  was  passed  on
regarding the  need  to  prepare  South  Africa  by  using  education  as  a
necessary tool and link to lay the foundation  for  governing  South  Africa
and bringing about social transformation and change.

Therefore I maintain that there is no crisis currently.  The  need  to  love
our country and to serve our people  with  diligence  and  commitment,  that
conciousness, I think, is inculcated in the youth. It is there. I think  the
generation of the '80s did not fail us and even the current generation  will
not fail us now.

Education should serve as a link between the previous  generations  and  the
current one. It should serve as a link between the foundation that  we  laid
in the past and the challenges of the present.

Minister Kadar Asmal and the chairperson Prof  Mayatulu  correctly  outlined
the achievements so far in terms of systemic changes in education,  redress,
equity and all those things. Therefore I will not dwell  on  them.  I  would
like to say what exactly the challenge is that is facing us  now.  When  you
put any  learner  or  any  human  being,  young  or  old,  into  a  learning
institution or a learning process, the first thing that you need  to  attain
is to enhance  that  person's  personality  and  to  develop  that  person's
talents and abilities, to harness respect in that person for  human  rights,
freedom and justice, to inculcate  a  sense  of  national,  continental  and
international values in that person, and to raise an awareness  and  respect
in that person for those values.  If  you  put  a  person  in  an  education
system, you would have failed if, in the end, you have not  sensitised  this
person to leading a responsible life that shows  compassion  for  the  weak,
the needy, the poor and the vulnerable.

That universal mission of education is a mission for South Africa  as  well,
but because we inherited the legacy of apartheid  and  apartheid  education,
we  have  special  responsibilities.  We  have  to  make  sure  that   after
addressing the problems  that  Minister  Bhengu  and  Minister  Kader  Asmal
addressed, we check whether the product that we are producing right  now  is
desirable for South Africa and for the challenges that are facing us now  in
terms of social transformation, turning around the economy, etc.

We face a huge  challenge  in  terms  of  human  resource  development.  The
President, time and again, correctly reiterates that the  problem  with  our
country is not that there are no jobs, but that the people do not  have  the
relevant skills to occupy those jobs. That  is  the  current  challenge  for
education. We need to address this as  a  matter  of  urgency.  We  need  to
ensure that we do not produce learners who send white  powder  with  threats
to rectors of universities,  learners  who,  under  cover  of  darkness  and
wearing balaclavas, attack other learners simply because of  how  they  look
or what they believe in.

We need to produce learners that are second to none in the world,  and  have
a passion for knowledge and a quest for  lifelong  learning,  learners  that
are sensitive to the needs of the country and  will  prepare  themselves  to
address those needs and challenges. We should produce learners, through  our
schooling system, our further education training and  our  higher  education
training, that are patriotic and willing to serve with  excellence.  I  want
to argue that we must make sure that we  instil  those  ideas  of  excellent
service and those abilities that are now  demonstrated  by  those  who  were
consciously trained to take the reins of leadership and  management  in  the
new South Africa, like the generation of the  June  16  detachment  and  the
Luthuli detachment, the conscious  process  of  which  our  President  Thabo
Mbeki is a product.

I do not think we are moving in terms of hastily producing that  type,  that
calibre of cadre, a new person that  is  politically  conscious  every  day,
alert and ready to lead, to manage and to solve the problems of society.

In closing, I would like to quote Comrade  Thabo  Mbeki,  from  Africa,  the
Time is Now. But before I do that, I think my message  to  the  youth  today
and to  education  as  a  whole,  to  parents,  communities,  educators  and
stakeholders in education, teacher unions,  etc,  is  this:  In  ``Ready  to
Govern'' we said that there would be  central  participation  of  organs  of
civil society in education. I do not know if we are  really  achieving  that
goal and mission that we set. Consultation has become  very  minimal.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker,  when  you  ask  our
children sitting behind desks in their classrooms in  Mogwase,  Thohoyandou,
Malamulele, Nongoma, Phuthaditjhaba and Mamelodi what they want to  be  when
they finish school, some will tell you that they want to  become  actuaries,
computer fundis of one shade or another, chartered accountants,  pilots  and
engineers of different descriptions.

They have  never  heard  of  the  human  resource  development  strategy  of
Government. They have never heard of the drive by our nation to  bridge  the
digital divide, but that doesn't matter.  What  matters  is  that  they  are
advancing the HRD strategy and that the Department of Education  is  playing
its role in bridging the digital divide and building  the  skills  that  are
necessary for our economy to grow.

Most of the children do not know that their parents had  no  opportunity  to
follow those fields of study. They do  not  know  the  relationship  between
their elegant academic aspirations and pursuits on the  one  hand,  and  the
national outpourings of love for Walter Sisulu on  the  other.  They  cannot
make  a  connection  between  the  heroic  deeds  of  Xhamela,  Steve  Biko,
Mangaliso Sobukwe and many other heroes of our people, and their freedom  to
study to become whatever they want. But that is not their fault. It  is  our
responsibility and duty  as  adults  to  help  the  children  to  make  that
connection.

A solid foundation has been laid for the struggle to eradicate the  vestiges
of  colonial  and  apartheid  education.  Our   policies   and   legislative
frameworks serve to broaden access to education and training, and  thus  put
us in a strong position to play a vital role in the National Human  Resource
Development Strategy.

Allow me to focus on only two programmes of the Department  of  Education  -
areas that are at opposite ends of the spectrum, but which  serve  a  common
purpose of development. On the one  hand,  we  have  special  projects  that
target the development of our people in the fields of  mathematics,  science
and technology, in pursuit of high skills growth. On the other,  we  have  a
renewed attention to literacy, to a  culture  of  reading  and  to  language
development - especially African languages - to support and build  the  many
communities where basic needs are not yet in place.

Just five years ago, information and communication  technologies,  or  ICTs,
were not part of the mainstream in education and even some higher  education
institutions lacked access  to  the  essential  features  of  Internet-based
research. Today they are  regarded  as  a  critical  part  of  the  delivery
infrastructure for a modern education system.

South Africa has a broadly favourable  environment  for  ICT.  The  enabling
legislative and policy frameworks  are  in  place  and  education  policies,
since White Paper 1 in 1995, have emphasised the development  of  innovative
methods of education, including the appropriate use  of  technologies  which
give practical expression to open learning principles.

Linked to ICT is the concept of e-education, which aims  to  accelerate  the
achievement of national education goals. E-education enables us  to  connect
learners to other learners, as well as  teachers  and  professional  support
services.  E-education  will  connect  learners  and  teachers   to   better
information  sources,  to  ideas  and  to  one  another  through   effective
combinations of face-to-face learning and technology. The  challenge  is  to
transcend the mere exchange of information and to transform  the  technology
into a range of learning activities that meet our educational objectives.

E-education includes the development of computer  literacy  and  the  skills
necessary to operate various technologies. This is essential for  everybody,
or soon will be. But e-education must also encourage the  ability  to  apply
ICT skills to access, manage, integrate, evaluate  and  create  information.
We must add value through technology, and not just do the same  things  more
efficiently. A learning society both uses and creates new knowledge  and  we
must encourage innovation in this field.
Without doubt, e-education has the potential to greatly  enhance  access  to
lifelong  education  and  training  opportunities,  which   will   in   turn
contribute towards improving the quality of life. A draft White Paper on  e-
education is in the final stages of approval and it will declare our aim  to
ensure that every South African learner in general and further education  is
ICT capable by the year 2013, which is a mere 10 years from now.

The National Strategy for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education,  or
Dinaledi, is geared towards creating tomorrow's stars today. As  a  starting
point,  we  identified   102   schools   from   historically   disadvantaged
backgrounds to provide dedicated attention to mathematics and  science.  The
aim was to both increase participation in these  subjects  and  improve  the
pass  rates.  These  schools  have  now  written  two   Senior   Certificate
examinations and we are happy  to  announce  that  during  this  period  the
enrolment in mathematics increased by 5%, while that for  science  increased
by 11%. We are also pleased  that  there  were  more  girls  than  boys  who
enrolled for mathematics. [Applause.]

The performance in these subjects also surpassed our 10%  target.  The  pass
rate for physical science improved by 13,7% and for  mathematics  by  10,7%.
However, the performance by female learners in these  subjects  still  falls
below that of males, especially on higher grade.

We intend building on the progress we have made  thus  far.  We  have  again
increased the participation  and  performance  targets  for  this  year  and
devised accountability mechanisms to monitor and support these  schools.  We
are looking forward to an exciting period,  which  will  coincide  with  the
introduction of the new National Curriculum Statement in  schools,  and  our
experience in Dinaledi will  come  in  handy  when  the  new  curriculum  is
implemented in the FET schools.

However, we cannot focus on  mathematics,  science  and  technology  at  the
expense of all else. There is a need for  these  to  also  be  infused  with
values. We have seen too often, including in recent times and also in  South
Africa,  the  havoc  that  can  be  wrought  through  dramatic  advances  in
technology without a moral code which will guide its use.

That is why we have placed such  a  strong  emphasis  on  human  rights,  on
history and on values in the revised  curriculum.  It  is  our  belief  that
every learning area, including science and mathematics, has the capacity  to
promote tolerance and respect, and the appreciation of diversity,  and  none
should be exempted from these underlying principles of  the  curriculum.  In
order to appreciate and embrace the values of our  Constitution,  which  are
equality, democracy and dignity, we must locate all that we do within  these
beliefs. We must understand where the freedoms of today  -  the  freedom  to
vote, to freely associate and to express oneself - have come from,  and  how
hard they were fought for.

The continued economic and social health of our  nation  and  our  democracy
depend on building a literate nation that is able to read  widely  both  for
practical  purposes  and  for  pleasure.  This  means  making  the   current
generation more aware of the pleasure and importance  of  reading  in  daily
life, and ensuring that they have the level of literacy skills  required  in
modern society.

Regrettably, one of the most serious factors, which continues  to  prejudice
African children and adult learners in particular, is the use  of  a  second
language as the medium of instruction and assessment. This prejudices  their
view of reading and compromises their development of  skills  and  concepts.
Recent research conducted in this country has shown that one of the  crucial
barriers to achievement by African children in particular  is  the  language
of  instruction.  Indeed  there  are  very  few  people  who  are  able   to
successfully read and study in a language that is not their  home  language.
That same research shows that the higher  the  mark  a  learner  obtains  in
English in matric, the greater are the chances that  that  student  will  do
well in higher education studies.

It is unfortunate that some schools use language as  a  barrier  to  access.
Children are excluded because the school is  said  to  be  of  a  particular
language. Schools are reminded of  the  requirement  that  if  a  sufficient
number of children require tuition in another language they  must  take  the
necessary steps to provide this.

Regrettably, where  this  has  happened  some  schools  have  done  so  very
reluctantly - met lang tande, as they say. They have effectively  opened  up
a school within a school, with separate teachers and facilities for the  so-
called English stream, which in effect constitutes  black  learners  in  the
school. The recent case in Groblersdal, where black members  of  the  school
governing body - that is, pupils and parents - were seated  apart  from  the
others for their inauguration, is an illustration of the pervasive  tendency
of the purportedly separate but equal ideology that destroyed so many  lives
and nearly ruined this country.

Language and literacy have been and remain areas  of  concern.  In  December
2000 the Ministry launched the Masifunde Sonke project  to  promote  reading
in schools, libraries and homes. Through  Masifunde  Sonke  we  promote  and
expose ourselves through our own literature - all the forms of  text  around
us. This happens through sharing literature - especially African  literature
- the adaptation of literature  setworks,  library  awards,  a  festival  of
books competition and numerous reading promotion roadshows.

In this financial year we will provide start-up libraries  for  450  schools
in the nine provinces and group  reading  materials  for  the  102  Dinaledi
schools. The matter  of  reading  will  be  profiled  at  the  International
Association  of  School  Librarianship  Conference  in  2003,  and  we  will
participate in the South African International Festival of Books in 2004.

The  department  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  language  in  education
policy,  even  though  the  powers  given  to  school  governing  bodies  to
determine language policies limit our capacity  to  pursue  national  goals.
Parental choice is  exercised  regarding  the  medium  of  instruction.  But
despite the proven educational benefits of home-language tuition,  at  least
in the formative years, most parents still choose English as the  medium  of
instruction. This  is  unfortunate,  and  an  advocacy  campaign  should  be
embarked  upon.  Also,  in  support  of  the  development  of  all  official
languages, we have published the revised national curriculum  statement  for
Grades R-9 in all languages, as well as a Braille version. These  are  small
steps, but they can help to change the consciousness of a teacher, a  parent
or a child, who will feel more confident  and  proud  of  his  or  her  home
language.

We have sketched a  map  of  two  important  fronts  that  we  believe  will
contribute towards building a better  and  more  equal  society.  As  people
living in a democratic dispensation, all voices must find  a  space  through
which they can contribute towards  education.  There  are  very  few  topics
indeed besides education on which every person  holds  a  view  and  has  an
interest. The debates around the nature and purpose of our education  system
must continue in our country. I thank you.
Mr L M KGWELE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister and hon  members,  I  rise
on behalf of the ANC to support the Education Budget Vote.

The ANC Government, in  partnership  with  our  people,  and  in  particular
school governing bodies, parents, educators, officials at  different  levels
of the education system and parties  represented  in  the  Education  Labour
Relations Council, has set a track record  of  delivering  on  our  nation's
education needs over the past nine years that will remain unsurpassed.  What
is even more gratifying is the extent to which we  have  increased  delivery
through expanded policy implementation and legislative measures.

Our vision as the ANC is of a South Africa in  which  all  our  people  have
equal access to lifelong learning,  education  and  training  opportunities,
which will contribute towards improving their quality of life  and  building
a peaceful, prosperous and democratic South Africa.

As the ANC, we believe, and are working  towards  ensuring,  that  the  poor
should have access to quality education that will ensure that they are  able
to remove the shackles of poverty. The  funding  model  for  schools  should
ensure that schools serving the poor are adequately provided  for  in  terms
of infrastructure and basic educational resources.

In this regard, we have identified our core programmes that will  guide  the
activities  of  the  Department  of  Education   with   regard   to   school
effectiveness over the medium-term years. Through Tirisano we have  achieved
greater  stability  in  our  schools,  as  evidenced  by   increased   basic
educational functionality, the ability of provincial educational systems  to
manage both human resources and financial policy, and  a  clearer  focus  on
delivery and implementation.

Under apartheid, the education system was racially divided, with  no  single
schools Act. There were 19 separate education  departments,  each  with  its
own bureaucracy, work culture, etc. School attendance was not mandatory  for
children between the ages of six and 15, and, in  rural  areas,  where  most
black people resided, the onus on funding schooling  provision  was  largely
passed on to the parents and the  community.  The  requirement  to  pay  for
schooling  was  not   met   with   the   representation   of   an   elected,
representative, governing body in place in the public schools.

The teaching  force  was  divided  and  was  not  governed  by  one  Act  of
Parliament and one provincial council. This meant that  teachers  could  not
organise or bargain freely with their  employers.  Equally,  teachers  could
not consult, criticise, propose and argue as they saw fit  without  fear  or
favour. In fact, many teachers were punished for expressing a point of  view
that was not in tune with their employers' views.

There was no  unifying  national  qualifications  framework  to  create  the
sinews of a national learning system, integrating education and training  at
all levels. This was compounded by an artificial division  between  training
and schooling and the deliberate undertraining of most black educators.

Underlying all of this was a divisive education  philosophy  of  fundamental
pedagogics propagated through schools based on the the narrow  viewpoint  of
Christian nationalism. This began with  the  assumption  that  all  learners
were  sinful.  This  was  the  basis  on  which  rote   learning,   corporal
punishment, differentiation based on ability or disability and  so  on  were
advanced.

The policy framework we established between 1995 and 1998  made  clear  that
there would be one unified  state  schooling  system,  based  on  democratic
principles, with considerable community and parent input and  with  a  focus
on quality. This has, to a large extent, been  achieved.  To  this  end,  we
congratulate the Department of Education on a new curriculum with texts  and
other resources to support it, which  fully  responds  to  the  needs  of  a
democratic society that aims to develop critical  thinking  adults  who  are
fully engaged with the world of work and have key skills rather  than  rote-
learned knowledge.

The Department of  Education,  in  partnership  with  the  Education  Labour
Relations Council, is offering unqualified and underqualified educators  the
opportunity to upgrade their qualifications and competencies. This is  being
advanced by the National Professional  Diploma  in  Education  in  terms  of
which  12 617  educators  have  registered  at  various   higher   education
institutions. This programme ensures that learners will no longer be  taught
by underqualified and unqualified educators.

The maths, science and technology programme  in  both  general  and  further
education  and  training  addresses  the  shortage  of  maths,  science  and
technology educators.

To enhance the status of the teaching profession, the Minister of  Education
introduced the  National  Teaching  Awards  scheme  in  1999  to  accelerate
excellence in education. This contributes to improvement in the  morale  and
commitment of educators to their profession.

We call on  all  our  people  to  make  themselves  available  to  serve  on
structures of governance currently under way in order to contribute  towards
our goal of quality public education for  all.  We  congratulate  the  North
West province on its leading role in this regard.

Since the promulgation of the South African Schools Act,  schools  have  had
access to considerable decentralised  powers.  Funds  are  devolved  to  the
schools which applied for and received these  powers,  that  is  section  21
schools. These now make up about 50% of all our schools in  most  provinces,
and nearly 100% in two provinces - Mpumalanga and the Northern Cape.

Increasingly, school managers  are  working  with  their  school  management
teams - SMTs - to develop the school in an inclusive, participatory  manner.
These SMTs are critical to the success of effective schools. They are  being
supported by increasingly well-trained district  officials.  As  section  21
school management  teams,  they  are  taking  up  new  responsibilities  and
learning new skills. This focus on site-based management  is  important  and
puts South Africa at the forefront of thinking on school management.

The department is also formulating and standardising training of  principals
and SMTs so that we do not have educators running schools  without  adequate
organisational  development,   administrative   management   and   financial
management training.

Schools in South Africa have  been  unsafe  environments  for  decades.  The
authorities ignored this problem until after 1994, but it  is  now  a  major
focus within the department. I should emphasise that in  the  Western  Cape,
particularly in areas such as Manenberg, Belgravia, Hanover Park and on  the
Cape Flats, drastic measures need to be taken to protect  our  children  and
communities from gang-related violence that spills over into schools.
We  commend  the  department  for  the  initiatives  and   many   successful
programmes  to  prevent  sexual  and  other  forms  of  abuse,   backed   by
documentation. However, the main factor reducing abuse  in  schools  is  the
steadily  decreasing  number  of  dysfunctional  schools.  We   congratulate
parties in the  Education  Labour  Relations  Council  on  finally  reaching
agreement on the quality assurance structures - the whole school  evaluation
policy - the developmental  appraisal  system,  performance  management  and
development appraisal.  This  bipartisan  approach  to  labour  and  quality
issues is an exciting new dimension in education.

The new salary restructuring programme will ensure that those educators  who
excel in the classroom, and  who  wish  to  remain  in  the  classroom,  are
afforded the necessary recognition, with a concomitant increase  in  salary,
without having to leave the classroom in search of promotion opportunities.

Finally, it is important to note that  as  part  of  the  overall  focus  on
children's rights, the school nutrition programme was  established.  Through
this programme the ANC has demonstrated the importance  we  attach  to  both
human and children's rights issues. A cup of  nourishing  hot  soup,  served
consistently, feeds a hungry child, tells the child that he or she is  loved
and encourages the child to come to school regularly - every child  has  the
right to have access to food and education.

Beyond the principle of access, school nutrition has been supported  because
of the role it plays in strengthening the core business of  education,  that
is enhancing the capacity of poor children to learn and succeed.  Even  with
the best educators and acclaimed curricula, hunger remains  a  major  threat
to the learning capacity of children in their formative years.

School nutrition is therefore one of the  critical  pillars  supporting  the
wellbeing  of  children.  To  this  end,  the  Departments  of  Health   and
Education, as co-managers, are busy preparing the  transfer  of  the  school
nutrition programme to the Department of Education.

Comrade Minister, we would wish to argue as  the  ANC  that  the  department
speed up the implementation of  the  resolutions  of  the  district  support
programme conference to ensure that the officials of the department  respond
to the challenges of Batho Pele-centred development.
As the ANC we endorse the position of the Ministry of  Education  that,  for
effective district level governance, it is imperative for officials at  this
level to be accountable for service delivery in the areas they are  supposed
to  service.  Too  often  when  we  visit   schools,   as   elected   public
representatives, we discover that the district  is  not  aware  of  problems
experienced by schools. Worse still is that  officials  have  never  visited
some of the schools. Such was the situation,  hon  Minister,  at  Osaletseng
Primary School  in  Letlhabile  until  the  your  much-appreciated  decisive
intervention.

Baagi ba Block C kwa Letlhabile na neseditse ditiro  tsa  gago,  Uthingo  le
Seaparankwe Motlotlegi Nelson Mandela pula. Re a leboga. Tota bana  ba  rona
ga se masiela. [The residents of Block C  at  Letlhabile  welcome  the  work
done by you, Uthingo and the hon Nelson Mandela. We thank  you.  Really  our
children are not orphans.]

We wish to further encourage learners this particular year - 2003 - to  work
hard so that they achieve a 100% pass rate. Indeed, hon Minister,  the  tide
has turned. You have indeed restored  public  confidence  in  our  education
system.

In particular I wish to congratulate the Michael Modisakeng High  School  in
the village of Majakaneng in my constituency, which was dubbed ``the  school
of shame'' by certain sections of the media, for  registering  a  pass  rate
which improved from 14,22% in 2001 to a  staggering  82%  in  2002.  Indeed,
they have defied sceptics and critics alike. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, I wish to use the time at my disposal to  respond
to the Minister and the  Department  of  Education's  new  draft  policy  on
religion education.

The ACDP believes that the school governing  bodies  reserve  the  right  to
choose  by  democratic  process  the  type  of  religious  ethos  at   their
particular schools. The choices may include a single  faith;  a  multifaith,
simular to that proposed by the policy document  on  religion  education;  a
secular faith as promoted by secular governments; or no  religion  education
classes at all.

We also agree with the idea that religion can help address  the  decline  in
moral standards in our country, the high rates of  crime  and  the  apparent
lack of respect for  human  life.  We  believe  the  notion  that  religious
instruction is  necessary  if  schools  are  to  develop  the  whole  person
including their spirituality is correct, and we agree with the  notion  that
religion goes beyond the confines of a church building and impacts on  every
area of life, acting as a philosophical and theological foundation  for  all
of reality.

The ACDP fundamentally disagrees with the present Government's  notion  that
schools  are  an  extension  of  the  state.  This  presupposition  is  very
dangerous as it opens all children, who happen  to  also  be  the  country's
future voters, to exploitation and indoctrination into a secularism that  is
consistent with that adopted by a self-proclaimed secular state.

Schools are not an extension of the state; schools are an extension  of  the
family.  Parents  have  and  raise  children,  not  the   state,   and   the
responsibility rests on parents to send their children to schools  of  their
choice. Schools are to be an extension of the values taught in the home  and
should not contradict them. To do otherwise, the state would  be  forcing  a
wedge between the family and the child through  the  agency  of  the  public
school.

It would, however, be discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional  on  the
part of the state to disallow parents and the religious community to  access
and give input to their children during school  and  school  hours.  To  ask
parents to send their children to school to be  indoctrinated  into  another
religion, such as secular humanism, and then remove their  right  and  power
to intervene is unacceptable.

Currently, our Government allows ministers of  religion  to  visit  prisons,
which are state institutions, to minister to prisoners. Not  only  are  they
allowed to preach and teach  in  prisons,  but  they  are  also  allowed  to
proselytise, and they do that. Similarly, in our  Defence  Force,  ministers
of religion are allowed to preach and teach from the Bible. However,  it  is
now the intention of  the  Minister  of  Education,  or  should  I  say  the
Minister of Religion,  to  ban  prayer,  religious  singing  and  devotional
scripture reading from school assemblies in the name of freedom of  religion
and tolerance.

Every time we open our mouths to sing the national  anthem,  Nkosi  Sikelel'
iAfrika, which is a Christian hymn, we pay tribute to the God of the  Bible.
So pupils are allowed to sing the national anthem, to sing about Christ,  to
sing about the Holy Spirit when they sing the national anthem, but they  are
not allowed to sing other anthems or other songs that promote the very  same
thing.

The Minister preaches  tolerance,  but  practices  bigotry.  If  the  school
governing body has accepted a particular religious culture for a  particular
school, why is the Minister  adopting  a  top-down  approach  to  force  all
schools to accept his format of a weekly assembly and  uniformity  in  terms
of multifaith prayer and instruction?  The  ACDP  will  never  accept  these
restrictions placed on school assemblies, and we call  on  all  parents  and
teachers to stand by their convictions.

The department's recent statement to prevent school  governing  bodies  from
employing  subject  specialists  at  their  schools  spells   disaster   for
education in this country. The  ACDP,  therefore,  will  vote  against  this
Budget Vote. I thank you.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mnr die Voorsitter, die  ANC  en  Minister  Asmal  is  baie
krities teenoor dr Verwoerd en die  instelling  van  Bantoe-onderwys.  Hulle
hoofrede vir dié  kritiek  is  dat  skole  deur  die  staat  gebruik  is  as
instrumente om die staat se agenda  op  die  swart  bevolking  af  te  dwing
sonder  dat  hulle  seggenskap  of  beheer  daaroor  gehad   het.   ``Social
engineering'' is dit destyds genoem.

Dit was presies die kritiek van  die  Afrikaners  ná  die  Anglo-Boereoorlog
teen Lord Milner. Hy wou die skoolstelsel gebruik om Afrikaanse kinders  vir
sy nasiebeoefening voor te berei. Nou die vraag, en  dít  kan  die  Minister
self besluit: as die Minister dieselfde besluit met die skoolstelsel, is  hy
ook besig met ``social engineering'' en dan  kan  sy  kritici  hom  met  reg
Milner noem en ek weet hy is baie sensitief daaroor. Maar dit hang  van  hom
af.

Milner wou ook Afrikaans en moedertaalonderrig  vernietig,  en  ek  kan  hom
aanhaal:


  Milner wished to ensure the dominance of the British element, politically
  and culturally  after  1902.  Therefore  instruction  through  the  Dutch
  language was not to be allowed in the government schools.

``Dutch  should  only  be  used  to  teach  English  and  English  to  teach
everything else'', volgens Milner. Nou is Minister Asmal is op  rekord  waar
hy hom sterk ten gunste van moedertaalonderwys uitgespreek het.  Nou  sê  ek
solank hy moedertaalonderrig bevorder, sal die VF hom  nie  'n  Milner  noem
nie. Die feit is egter dat onderwys deur medium van Afrikaans geleidelik  al
hoe dieper in die moeilikheid raak.

In 1994 was daar 2 700 skole  wat  Afrikaans  as  die  enigste  onderrigtaal
gebruik het. Volgens 'n onlangse artikel in die media  is  daar  tans  slegs
310. Van 2 700 tot 310 in nege jaar het ons agteruit gevorder.  Dit  beteken
dat minder as die helfte van die huidige ongeveer 700 000  Afrikaansprekende
skoliere dus nog hul onderrig in enkelmediumskole ontvang. Dit  beteken  nie
dat die meerderheid skole nou skielik dubbelmedium is nie, want dan sou  ons
in 'n sekere rigting gevorder het. Dit beteken  dat  meer  as  90%  van  die
27 000 skole in Suid-Afrika enkelmedium-Engels is. Wat 'n  swak  rekord  vir
moedertaalonderrig in 'n land met elf amptelike tale!

Maar dit is ook 'n aanklag teen  die  ouers  en  ook  'n  aanklag  teen  die
verskillende taalgemeenskappe. Die Afrikaanse taalgemeenskap het daarom  ook
'n  verantwoordelikheid.  Daar  is  tans   reeds   'n   groot   tekort   aan
Afrikaanssprekende onderwysers. 'n Tekort nie net in vakke soos wiskunde  en
natuur-en-skeikunde nie, maar ook in ander  vakke.  Prof  Beckmann  van  die
Universiteit van Pretoria sê dat in 2010 daar 'n verwagte tekort van  10 000
Afrikaanse onderwysers gaan wees.  Dit  gaan  Afrikaanse  skole  geen  ander
keuse laat as om sekere vakke slegs in Engels aan te bied nie,  wat  tot  'n
verdere verswakking sal lei. Die  Afrikaanse  gemeenskap  sal  moet  besluit
daaroor al dan nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, the ANC and Minister Asmal are very  critical
of Dr Verwoerd and the introduction of Bantu education.  Their  main  reason
for this criticism is that schools were used by the state as instruments  to
enforce the state's agenda upon the black population  without  their  having
any say in or control over it. It was called ``social engineering''  at  the
time.

That is exactly the criticism of Afrikaners of Lord Milner after the  Anglo-
Boer War. He wanted to use the school system to prepare  Afrikaans  children
for his national practises. Now the question, and this the Minister  himself
can decide: If the Minister makes the same  decision  regarding  the  school
system, he is also involved in social engineering and then his  critics  can
rightly call him Milner and I know that he is  very  sensitive  about  this.
But that depends on him.

Milner also wanted to destroy Afrikaans and mother tongue  instruction,  and
I can quote him:


  Milner wished to ensure the dominance of the British element, politically
  and culturally, after  1902.  Therefore  instruction  through  the  Dutch
  language was not to be allowed in the government schools.

According to Milner: ``Dutch should  only  be  used  to  teach  English  and
English to teach everything else''. Now  Minister  Asmal  is  on  record  as
having expressed himself strongly in favour of mother tongue education.  Now
I say that as long as he promotes mother tongue instruction the FF will  not
call him a Milner. However,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  education
through the medium of Afrikaans is gradually running into deeper trouble.

In 1994 there were 2 700 schools that used Afrikaans as  the  only  language
of instruction. According to recent  article  in  the  media  there  are  at
present only 310. We have progressed in reverse from 2 700 to  300  in  nine
years' time. This  means  that  less  than  half  of  the  present  700  000
Afrikaans-speaking pupils are therefore still  receiving  their  instruction
in single medium schools. This does not mean that the  majority  of  schools
have suddenly become dual medium, because if that were  the  case  we  would
have progressed in a certain direction. It means that more than 90%  of  the
27 000 schools in South Africa  are  single  medium  English.  What  a  poor
record for mother tongue instruction  in  a  country  with  eleven  official
languages!

But this is also an indictment against the parents and  also  an  indictment
against the various language communities. The Afrikaans  language  community
therefore also has a responsibility. At present there  is  already  a  grave
shortage of Afrikaans-speaking teachers. A shortage  not  only  in  subjects
such as mathematics, science and chemistry,  but  also  in  other  subjects.
Prof Beckmann from the University of Pretoria says that in 2010  there  will
be an estimated shortage of 10  000  Afrikaans  teachers.  This  will  leave
Afrikaans teachers no choice  than  to  present  certain  subjects  only  in
English, which will cause a further deterioration. The  Afrikaans  community
will have to decide about this or not.]

How do we see the relationship between the community and  the  state?  Where
does education and the school as an institution fit in? I think this is  one
of the main differences between the FF and the Department of Education.

Religious people do not see their lives as being compartmentalised. You  are
not a Muslim only on Fridays or only at the mosque. You are not a  Christian
only on Sundays. They believe that you cannot separate the  two.  From  that
perspective  school  and  education  is  an  extension   of   the   parents'
responsibility in raising their children. The governing  body  at  a  school
thus becomes very important in making the right  decisions  in  representing
the parents. Because the parents pay taxes, they see it as their money  that
the Government makes available  to  the  school  and  their  right  to  make
decisions on the ethos of the school. I  think  that  is  where  our  debate
comes in.

From the Minister and the department's perspective, school is  a  government
institution paid for by the state. Therefore the  Government  may  prescribe
and decide how schools  will  be  used  for  achieving  whatever  goals  the
Government may decide on for the children.

The Government's present proposals on religion are  largely  based  on  this
perspective and also on Western models  differentiating  between  state  and
private schools. In state schools no religion is  then  allowed.  From  this
perspective, parents must send their children to a private school if  it  is
important to them that their children  attend  a  school  with  a  religious
ethos.

The present proposal of the Department of  Education  will  therefore  force
parents who prefer a specific religious approach to send their  children  to
private schools. This will  be  discriminatory  and  unfair,  because  these
parents will then have to pay twice. They have to pay taxes  for  Government
education, which they will not make use of, as  well  as  school  funds  for
private schools. Most parents cannot afford this.

The FF proposes that Government could  solve  the  problem  of  religion  in
schools by having a completely new approach towards education. Why don't  we
look at some other models in an effort to solve the problem  to  everybody's
satisfaction? Be less prescriptive. Give more choices, not fewer.

I gave the Dutch and Indian models as examples that may prove to  give  some
better solutions and that we recommend you can learn  from.  For  peace  and
harmony  in  a  diverse  society  you   need   accommodation,   not   forced
assimilation or prescribed solutions. Wasn't that part of the  problem  with
Bantu education?

The present  reaction  of  religious  groups  in  South  Africa  was  to  be
expected. I ask this question against this background: Do  we  really  need,
at this moment, new models for religion in schools? In Afrikaans there is  a
saying: ``Moenie krap waar dit nie jeuk nie''. Do not scratch where it  does
not itch. The Minister's proposals have already  led  to  emotional  student
marches and communities planning to go to  court  over  this  issue.  Surely
there are many other important priorities in  South  Africa  that  need  our
attention and energy at this moment? Thank you, Sir.

Mr I S MFUNSDISI: Chairperson and hon members, the Education budget  is  one
of the highest that this Parliament has to approve. This is  not  surprising
as education has to be provided to  all,  from  the  cradle  to  the  grave,
though we have yet to see the back broken of illiteracy, as promised by  the
Minister in 1999 after his appointment.
The greater chunk of the budget is allocated to transfer payments to  higher
education institutions.  Some  R100 million  has  been  set  aside  for  the
restructuring of these institutions. It is  gratifying  that  the  heads  of
some  of  these  institutions  have  taken  the  lead   in   ensuring   that
restructuring succeeds. This, we have seen in the  media,  and  some  of  us
have personal communication to that effect.

The R35 million increase added to early childhood education is most  welcome
as it will assist in providing access to quality education for  children  in
the reception year. One big question, however, is whether there  are  enough
educators qualified to mount the task.  Another  question  is  whether  this
will be rolled out to reach even the remotest parts  of  our  country  where
such financial injection is in great need, as even  the  regular  classrooms
are in short supply.

On the surface it appears that the National  Student  Financial  Aid  Scheme
has sufficient funds for deserving students, but because the  assistance  is
subjected to a means test some students are unable to realise their  dreams.
However, we take note that past students are paying  back  to  irrigate  the
fund.
Poverty relief projects, such as  Thuba  Makote  and  Ikhwelo,  have  to  be
clarified. May this house, Mr Minister,  be  informed  as  to  how  the  450
educators due for training and employment in  driving  the  Ikhwelo  project
will be selected and which areas they will come from. The  question  of  the
governing bodies due to be  capacitated  in  this  project  should  also  be
clarified. On the question of Thuba Makote, we hope  the  Minister  will  be
able to indicate where  the  20  multifunctional  schools  being  built  are
situated.

The debate around religion in schools will remain  on  the  agenda  of  most
political parties, civil society and  ecumenical  bodies  for  a  very  long
time. While the Minister has opted for the American model in  handling  this
matter, there are other schools of thought. A South African model has to  be
unique as we already have a basis. Most of the African leaders have been  to
these denominational schools and their leadership  has  never  been  put  to
question. We, however, appreciate that more time has been set aside  by  the
Minister to have informed debates on the issue.

Some R5 million has been earmarked as a once-off transfer to the Jacob  Zuma
Trust Fund. This, we are told, is meant to cater for the  educational  needs
of victims identified through  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  process.  Of
interest is whether this will cover the entire country,  or  whether  it  is
for some specific area or areas. Which criteria will  the  department  apply
in identifying those students?

We  have  noticed  with  interest  that  the  department  is  preparing   to
scrutinise the programmes and credentials of  institutions  that  offer  MBA
degrees. The UCDP  welcomes  this  move.  We  believe  that  South  Africans
deserve the best tuition to be able to render service that  will  be  second
to none.

Our position is that teaching  is  a  labour  of  love.  Those  involved  in
teaching should do so passionately. We applaud the Minister for  having  put
his foot  down  that  he  runs  the  department,  allows  administrators  to
administer it, and puts it clearly to educators that their  business  is  to
educate our children and not to run provincial departments of education  let
alone the national one.

It is unfortunate that our universities are left reeling in damage  control.
In recent weeks  we  noticed  that  there  was  racial  intolerance  at  the
Universities of Stellenbosch and  Pretoria.  At  Stellenbosch,  students  of
Afrikaner origin make life difficult for other racial groups, such as  those
of African and Jewish origin. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T ABRAHAMS: Hon Chairperson, comrades, friends and  others,  as  a  proud
member of the ANC, the only party which has been able, is able and  will  be
able to steer South Africa away from chaos and disaster, I offer no  excuses
for having served in the opposition, because I served in that  capacity  out
of conviction and on the basis of that which my party of  the  time  offered
the electorate in 1999.

However, in the course of time, the enormity of the challenges facing  South
Africa became increasingly clear to me. Questions arose  in  my  mind  about
what positive contribution I was making towards democratising South  Africa,
towards changing the mindset of those who fight to hold onto the ugly  past,
towards improving service delivery to  the  public,  towards  ensuring  that
South Africa would have an abundant, well  balanced,  suitably  skilled  and
literate human resource base.

The realisation grew in me that, instead of honouring  the  mandate  of  our
electorate, I was merely fulfilling the role of a critical assessor  of  the
initiatives of the ruling party and seeking reasons to oppose them.  Someone
once said that it is in the darkroom that negatives are developed. When  ANC
members spoke of creating a better life for all,  I  had  to  find  specific
examples of how life was not better for  some.  When  comrades  spoke  about
rolling back the frontiers of poverty, it was crucial  to  the  survival  of
the opposition to show that great poverty existed. [Applause.]

Thus, I stand before you, convinced that I  am  doing  the  right  thing  by
following the great leaders  of  the  ANC,  like  the  late  Comrade  Walter
Sisulu, who sacrificed so much to save South Africa from  the  abyss.  I  am
happy to be out of the darkroom and that I have the light  of  the  ANC  all
around me. [Applause.]

Allow me to make it very clear that I speak in support of the  Budget  Vote.
Golfers say that driving is for show, but it  is  putting  that  brings  the
dough. In a grand sense, this analogy can  be  related  to  education  as  a
whole. All of education is ineffective if it  does  not  ultimately  produce
graduates with the appropriate skills, competencies, knowledge and  research
required to contribute to economic and social improvement.
Therefore, while important  and  wide-ranging  changes  have  been  effected
across the spectrum of education, the sector upon which I wish to  focus  in
this debate is that of higher education, and the vital role it has  to  play
in rolling back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  Higher  education  is  a  key
function in the successful  conversion  of  South  Africa  from  a  racially
divided  land  of  inequality  to  an  egalitarian  and  thriving  land   of
opportunity for all.

While institutional changes were brought about in the  last  decade,  it  is
important to note that the ANC had returned South Africa to the world  arena
and that these institutional adjustments merely constituted  a  response  to
the demands  of  a  rapidly  globalising  world  more  than  anything  else.
Increased competition amongst institutions carried the prospect  of  further
fragmentation. The  system  remained  ineffectual  and  fragmented,  with  a
throughput too pathetic to meet the requirements for growth of South  Africa
as a country.

It became clear for all to see that the system was in desperate  need  of  a
complete overhaul. It required a conversion into one  that  would  meet  the
needs  of  all  South  Africans  while  simultaneously  fulfilling  the  key
function of enhancing competitiveness in the global economic  arena.  It  is
towards these ends that the Higher Education Act was  promulgated  in  1997.
This Act provides for a unified and nationally planned  co-ordinated  system
of higher education. It also provides for  a  statutory  council  of  higher
education to advise the Minister.

White Paper 3 of  1999  clearly  enunciates  the  objectives  that  must  be
reached in the transformation of the higher education  system.  Implicit  in
the requirements set out in this  White  Paper  is  the  need  to  meet  the
demands of social justice. The system must also be tranformed into one  that
produces quality graduates -  people  equipped  with  the  skills  that  are
necessary. The system must further be transformed into  one  which  reflects
the effective  and  efficient  utilisation  of  resources  in  the  face  of
competing priorities in other social sectors.

The Higher Education Act and Education White Paper 3 on Higher Education  of
1999 together form the basis for the transformation of the  higher  eduction
sector. I need to refer to the consultation process. I need to mention  that
the national  working  group,  which  was  appointed,  brought  forward  its
report, and that the hon Minister embarked on extensive consultation  across
the board with anyone  who  cared  to  make  a  contribution.  Out  of  that
developed the plan that was finally approved by the Cabinet towards the  end
of that year.

Boldly,  we  have  now  graduated  to  the   more   practical   aspects   of
restructuring. In  this  regard,  recognition  must  be  given  to  all  the
stakeholders involved in the merger of the M L Sultan Technical College  and
Natal Technikon in Durban for  their  endeavours.  This  includes  academia,
students,  parents,  nonacademic  staff  and  especially  the   departmental
officials. Effecting  a  merger  at  the  best  of  times  is  not  an  easy
operation,  and  it  is  to  be  expected  that  there  will  be  anxieties,
misinterpretations and even blind resistance.

Despite all these difficulties these South Africans have experienced, it  is
evident that collective wisdom has prevailed and that  they  have  triumphed
over the impediments to restructuring and renewal created in some  quarters.
Here we have indisputable proof that where there  is  a  commitment  to  the
future of South Africa, rather than an unbending adherence to  narrow  self-
interest or even institutional interests, success can be achieved.

The hope is expressed that the osmosis of minds  will  allow  for  the  hard
experiences of the Durban Institute of Technology in  their  merger  process
to permeate the efforts of all those tertiary institutions that are  in  the
throes of discussions. It is prudent to keep in mind that restructuring,  in
itself, is but the beginning of the process of transformation. If the  goals
and objectives outlined in the national plan are to be  achieved,  the  work
has only just begun. However, we know  and  we  trust  that  our  department
especially is up to the task.

One of the objectives outlined in the White  Paper  is  that  each  province
should eventually have at least one modern,  leading  tertiary  institution.
The  restructuring  is  therefore  pivotal  to  and   imperative   for   the
consolidation of access to quality higher education in all provinces  within
the boundaries of South Africa. A noteworthy step in this direction  is  the
planned opening of national institutes for higher education in the  Northern
Cape and Mpumalanga in 2004.

We would like the hon Minister, if he has the time when he replies, to  give
us a  little  more  information  on  how  he  envisages  these  institutions
working, particularly in the Nothern Cape which is such an unusual  province
- the largest in the country  with  the  smallest  population  scattered  in
little settlements all over, with its capital off-centre geographically.

While these positive and consolidating efforts proceed within  our  country,
it is critical that we take cognisance of the role South  Africa  must  play
on the continent of Africa. Under the aegis of the African Union and in  the
context of Nepad, it is of great consequence that we tap into the  reservoir
of knowledge, skills and expertise available in Africa. By the  same  token,
it is important that we continue to avail  our  halls  of  academia  to  our
sister states so that, ultimately, we can collectively  ensure  that  Africa
takes its rightful place in the global arena.

Our African leaders have pledged to work at  eradicating  poverty,  as  Prof
Mayatula  has  indicated,  and  to  strive  for   sustainable   growth   and
development. A new mood is growing, and the awareness is manifesting  itself
that the salvation of Africa  lies  within  Africa.  African  solutions  are
being sought for the challenges of Africa.  The  pressing  urgency  of  this
need for the continent to elevate itself into  the  global  economy  demands
heightened performance from our collective higher education institutions.

The underdevelopment of Africa will  persist  or  even  grow  worse  if  our
tertiary institutions fail to shape the minds of our future leaders of  this
continent.  Indifference  towards  educational  self-advancement  among  the
young and  lackadaisical  attitudes  among  students  on  campuses  must  be
combated, and every adult in the country must pitch  in  to  remotivate  the
youth of South Africa.

I wish to place on record my appreciation for the unstinting work  delivered
by the  hon  Minister,  Dr  Kader  Asmal;  the  Director-General,  Mr  Thami
Mseleku; the Chief Director of Higher Education, Mr Ahmed  Essop;  the  rest
of the sectors and department heads who have also  been  very  helpful;  the
Deputy Director-General of Higher Education, Ms Nasima Badsha;  the  members
of the SA Council on Higher Education; Mr Saki Macozoma;  and  the  national
working group.

My  comrades  and  colleagues  on  the  portfolio   committee,   under   the
chairmanship of Prof Mayatula, have my  appreciation  for  their  unwavering
interest in education. I thank you, Sir. [Applause.]

Mr  P  J  NEFOLOVHODWE:  Chairperson,  it  is  common  knowledge  that   the
educational  institutions  we  inherited  from  the  apartheid  system  were
designed to further the interests of the  privileged,  and,  to  the  extent
that black people were brought into this system, with the  specific  purpose
of making them spanner boys and girls of the racist  apartheid  system  that
dominated our country.

It is therefore pleasing to note that  the  department  has  embarked  on  a
transformation process  to  get  rid  of  the  legacy  of  apartheid  racist
education. Azapo supports this process despite some of the obstacles  it  is
experiencing at the moment. To us  a  transformation  process,  particularly
the  one  that  seeks  to  dismantle  past  power  relations,  is  bound  to
experience some of the problems we have witnessed so far.

Hon members would remember that black people were not  integrated  into  the
then education setup in our country. It is in this context that  I  want  to
address this gathering about the poor's position in  our  education  system.
The challenge is: How do we transform our institutions of learning  in  such
a way that they can adequately serve the interests of the majority  who  are
poor? Do we do  this  by  reducing  the  number  of  institutions  that  are
accessible to the poor, or by increasing access to them by the poor?

Azapo believes that owing to past practices by the racistÿapartheid  regime,
in which most well-funded institutions were accessible mostly to whites  and
in which most government support went to these institutions, it is now  time
that we redress this imbalance. In our view, the  poor,  in  this  instance,
must receive a greater portion of the funding in this regard.

To this end, we suggest that more and more children from  poor  families  be
enabled by the department to access institutions  of  higher  learning.  The
fact that poor parents cannot afford  the  school  fees  demanded  by  these
institutions should not be used to deny children  and  their  parents  their
right to decent education. They did not choose to be poor, apartheid did.

Azapo has always held the view that the  objective  and  precondition  of  a
transformation process at these institutions  of  higher  learning  were  to
make sure that they were liberated from the racist  apartheid  bondage  and,
at the same time, making these institutions more accessible to the poor.  In
other words, the transformation of these institutions of learning should  be
of such a nature that the majority of our people, who are poor, are able  to
find a home in them. The majority should begin  to  see  these  institutions
articulating their wishes and desires and their world outlook.

We say the  poor's  world  outlook  should  find  room  in  institutions  of
learning, because we have come to the conclusion that every class  or  group
in society has the  responsibility  of  sustaining  its  own  interests  and
development. The entry point of the poor to the present-day institutions  of
learning is therefore through transforming these institutions  so  that  the
body  of  knowledge  developed  at  them  is  consistent  with  the   poor's
objectives and their future. Azapo supports  the  Budget  Vote.  Thank  you.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJABLLY: Chairperson, Minister, this department mirrors  our  future
as it moulds our future leaders, professionals, artisans  and  society.  The
aims and plans the Education department has set for this sphere  is  crucial
as an educated nation makes for a stronger nation. In a country  where  more
than 50% of the citizenry is illiterate, this is challenging.  However,  the
MF applauds the department's efforts to reach the corners  of  South  Africa
to achieve a literate South Africa.

With the division in education that came with the apartheid  regime,  it  is
indeed a hard task that the department has been  entrusted  with.  Over  the
past few months and periods,  visits  were  made  to  various  provinces  to
examine  situations  in  schools.  Sadly,  many  were  found  to  be  almost
impossible learning environments - poor sanitation, a lack of resources,  no
textbooks and furniture, and some schools  had  no  solid  structure  but  a
tree. These are but some of the sad circumstances that still  exist  because
of the past. But we have noted the priorities, which it is hoped  that  this
year's budget will facilitate.

From hon Minister Trevor Manuel's Budget Speech, this appears  to  be  quite
promising, with additional funds being  made  available  for  textbooks  and
higher education concerns and skills. We need schools as  much  as  we  need
teachers. It is shocking to note that throughout South Africa  schools  face
possible closure, such as recently in KwaZulu-Natal where 100 schools  faced
possible closure, mainly as a result of water and  electricity  debts.  This
is a general cause of illegal electricity connections and  theft  of  water.
Although it is has been decided that these debts will be  recovered  through
the annual allocation, something needs to be  done.  We  cannot  afford  the
closure of schools here or elsewhere in the country.

Government cannot work alone in these sectors. Parents need to be  urged  to
participate in  school  governing  bodies  to  ensure  the  best  for  their
children. The dissatisfaction and concerns parents  voice  should  be  heard
and acted upon, and the means to do so is  through  these  school  governing
bodies. It is a constitutional right, and our hon Minister of Education  has
taken the initiative to have parents involved in the printing of the  school
handbook. This is further supported by the South African Schools Act.

Good news, though, sprouts from tertiary educations, such as the  University
of  Natal,  Durban,  known  for  its  strict  admission  criteria  and   the
University of Durban-Westville, known for admitting  those  below  criteria.
They have taken on the challenge of breaking  institutional  barriers.  They
are working and formulating progressive access  policies  that  will  enable
poor but deserving students to have accommodation.

It is hoped that the department will utilise its  budget  wisely  to  fulfil
the educational needs of our people.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, may I take this  opportunity  to  congratulate
the Minister of Education on his efforts and hard  work  and  on  trying  to
level the playing field.  Minister,  keep  up  the  good  work.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Nk P N  MNANDI:  Sihlalo  woSihlalo,  oNgqongqoshe  abahloniphekile,  Sekela
Ngqongqoshe  wezeMfundo,   bahlonishwa,   maqabane   nezihlobo,   ngiyabonga
ukuthola  leli  thuba  lokubamba  iqhaza  kule   nkulumompikiswano   yohlelo
lwesabiwozimali zemfundo yakuleli. Futhi ngisho  ngingananazi  ukuthi  thina
singuKhongolose,  siyalweseka   lolu   hlelo   lwesabiwozimali   lwezemfundo
lwanamhlanje.

Le nyanga kaNhlaba kulo nyaka,  ibe  yinyanga  enefu  elimnyama  kumzabalazo
waseNingizimu Afrika. Sohlala sibakhumbula njalo abasebenzi abalala  edamini
laseBhetlehema, okuthe sisakhungathekile  kwagoduka  iqhawe  lesizwe,  ubaba
uWalter  Sisulu.  Sizobakhumbula   ngokuthi   siwuqhube   njalo   umzabalazo
wokushabalalisa ububha nobuphofu ezweni lonkana.

Namhlanje ngizokhuluma  ngemfundo  ephakeme.  Okokuqala,  ngabe  ngiyibhimbi
namhlanje  uma  ngingabongi  kuHulumeni  oholwa  nguKhongolose   ngomsebenzi
asewenzile  kule  minyakana  nje   eyisishiyagalolunye   ephethe   izintambo
zombuso. Awu bakwethu, umehluko mkhulu  ngendlela  emangalisayo.  Awu  wema!
Sonke  siyazi   ukuthi   besinjani   isimo   semfundo   ephakame   ngaphansi
kukahulumeni wamabhunu. Umuntu omnyama ubeya  enyuvesi  ukuyofunda  izifundo
ebezimenza   angakwazi   ukuzimela.   Bezimenza    ukuthi    ahlale    njalo
eyisicashalala  sabamhlophe.  Kubona  ubufunde  waqeda  uma   ube   uthisha,
umhlengikazi, usonhlalakahle kumbe umfundisi.

Isimo siyaphoqa kwesinye isikhathi  ukuthi  sikhumbuze  le  Ndlu  ukuthi  le
mfundo  esikhuluma  ngayo  namhlanje  yathengwa  ngegazi  lezingane  zabantu
abamnyama. [Ihlombe.] Le mfundo yazatshalazelwa izingane  zabhadla  emajele,
ezinye zaya ekudingisweni zincane. Izingane zaziba ukudla  komthetho  wesimo
esibucayi mihla namalanga. Kwakunzima, kwakujuluka  umnsinsila  nasemadodeni
imbala. [Ihlombe.]

Mangikhulume   ngesikhwama   sikaHulumeni   sokusiza   abafundi   emfundweni
ephakeme.  Lesi  sikhwama  inhloso  yaso   ukusiza   ikakhulukazi   abafundi
abaqhamuka  emiphakathini   entulayo,   emiphakathini   yakithi   ebincishwe
amathuba ngaphambilini. Ngalowa nyaka,  sakhala  la  singuKhongolose,  sisho
ukuthi sinezinkinga ngemali yokubhalisa  emanyunivesi  ngoba  phela  umfundi
ontulayo uba nethemba lokungena enyunivesi uma ezwa ngalesi sikhwama.  Kodwa
uma efika enyunivesi kuthiwa cha, qala ukhokhe imali  yokubhalisa  ngaphambi
kokuthi ukwazi ukubhalisa kulesi sikhwama.  Lokho  nje  bese  kuba  yisihibe
kumfundi ongazi ukuthi uzothathani ahlanganise nani.

Awu, ngabe senza iphutha bakwethu uma singabongi  kulezi  zikhungo  zemfundo
ephakeme, eziye zasabela ngokuthi  zithathe  le  mali  yokubhalisa  ziyifake
ngaphansi kwesikhwama lesi.  Ezinye  ziye  zehlisa  imali  yokubhalisa  yaba
inani elifinyelelekayo, isuka ko-R2000 nemali yehla  yaya  ko-R500.  Bakhona
abaqhamuka kulezi khungo lapha eNdlini namhlanje.  Kubona  siyabonga.  Sithi
lokhu kungukuphonsa itshe esivivaneni kuthi labo  abangakenzi  lutho  basike
iphethini.

Lesi  sikhwama  njengamanje  sisiza  abafundi  abangu-308  589.  Abesifazane
kubona  bangaphezulu  kuka-53%  kuthi   abesilisa   babengu-46%.   Imikhakha
yokufunda yona miningi kakhulu ngeke ngiyiqede yonke kodwa ngizocaphuna  nje
emibalwa - kwezokuphatha isiza abafundi abangu-29 498;  kwezohwebo  ifundisa
abafundi   abangu-32   253;   ezobunjiniyela   kunabafundi   abangu-6   265;
kwezobudokotela 3 780; kwezesayensi 12 580. Siyabonga Khongolose.

Ngqongqoshe, uKader Asmal,  kubo  bonke  laba  bafundi  akucaci  neze  kahle
ukuthi bangaki abakhubazekile abasizwa yilesi sikhwama.  Uma  sifuna  ukwazi
ngesabelo sabakhubazekile, utshelwa ukuthi izikhungo azisho  ukuthi  umfundi
ukhubazekile. Kuphela abakucacisayo okwalabo abangaboni ngoba bona  basayina
ngezithupha  kunoma  basayine  ngezandla.  Kuyakhanya  bha   ukuthi   ibhodi
elengamele  lesi  sikhwama  alikakayisukumeli  kahle  leyo  yabakhubazekile.
UMnyango wezeMfundo mawuhlale phezu kwayo.

Mangibonge futhi kubo  bonke  abafundi  ebebekade  besizwa  yilesi  sikhwama
asebeqedile bakwazi ukukhokha imali njengoba  uNqgonqgoshe  eshilo  engango-
R210 million.

Mangingene ngqo ezikhungweni eziphakame zakuleli, ngikhulume  ngezokuphatha.
Kuma-technikon akuleli abantu abamnyama abasezingeni  lokuphatha  bangu-23%,
amakhaladi wona angu-16%, abomdabu bamaNdiya bangu-7%,  abamhlophe  babengu-
53% kuthi abesifazane babengu-19% kuphela. Nasemanyuvesi  isithombe  sicishe
sifane. Ngqonqgoshe, uKader Asmal,  lolu-ke  akulona  olokusinisa  amahleza.
Izikhungo  zethu  mazifane  neSouth  Africa   esikuyona   namhlanje.   Zonke
maziphathwe ngendlela efanelekile.

Ngibuye futhi ngibuze ukuthi kazi bangaki na  abakhubazekile  kuleli  zinga?
Njengoba nje kumfimfa embokodweni, kazi bona-ke bayiliphi Nkosi yami.

Ngithanda  ukusho  ukuthi  thina  singuKhongolose   sikhathazekile   ngesimo
sabafundi  abakhubazeke  ngokungezwa.   Basenkingeni   yokuthola   izikhungo
ezinabafundisi  abafundisa  ngokukhuluma  ngezandla.  Ezikhungweni  zemfundo
ephakeme kuleli, bagcina sebephoqeleke ukuthi bathathe  izifundo  abangazazi
nabangazithandi. Cha bo bo!  Makungabi  nesihibe  esima  endleleni  yomfundi
ngoba ekhubazekile. Abaphathi bezikhungo zemfundo ephakeme mabalubheke  lolu
daba ngeso lokhozi.

Olunye udaba olubalulekile yilolu  lomqondo  oza  ngakithina,  ngolwasemzini
sithi i-brain gain. Kunenkinga-ke ekhona ezikhungweni zakithi  lapha  eSouth
Arica. Uma kufika izifundiswa zakwamanye  amazwe  anjengoBritain  no-America
zithathelwa phezulu bese kuthi  labo  abaqhamuka  emazweni  anjengoCuba  ne-
Africa benziwe amajuniya. Asizwa nje  nangeqhaza  elibanjwe  yilabo  abaqome
ukuletha umqondo wabo la. [Siphelile isikhathi] [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of
Zulu speech follows.)

[Ms P  N  MNANDI:  Chair  of  Chairs,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy  Minister  of
Education,  hon  members,  comrades  and  friends,  thank   you   for   this
opportunity to take part in this debate on the budget for education today.

The month of May this year  was  an  unfortunate  month  in  South  Africa's
struggle for liberation. We shall  always  remember  the  workers  who  were
killed in a dam in Bethlehem. Before we could recover from that trauma,  the
nation lost its hero, Mr Walter Sisulu. We shall keep  our  memory  of  them
alive by taking forward the struggle against poverty in the whole country.

Today I am going to discuss higher education. Firstly, I shall  have  failed
to present my speech properly if I omit thanking the ANC-led Government  for
the work they have done in their short period of nine years  in  government.
Good people, there  is  such  a  vast  difference.  We  all  know  what  the
situation was like in higher education  under  the  Boer  government.  Black
people used to go to universities to study courses that would not give  them
independence but make them perpetual lackeys of white people. To  them,  you
were regarded as highly educated if you  had  a  teaching,  nursing,  social
work or minister of religion qualification.

The situation sometimes demands that we remind the House that the  education
we are discussing today was purchased with  the  blood  of  black  children.
[Applause.] A struggle was waged for this education.  Children  were  jailed
and others had to be exiled at  a  very  young  age.  Day  in  and  day  out
children fell victim to the state of emergency. Things  were  so  hard  that
even men found it difficult to cope. [Applause.]

Let me talk about the Government's financial aid for higher education.  This
fund's purpose is to assist students, more especially  those  from  a  needy
background, our previously disadvantaged communities. The year  before  last
we as the ANC raised the complaint that we have a problem with  registration
fees at  universities  because  a  needy  student's  hopes  of  studying  at
university  are  raised  the  moment  he  or  she  hears  about  this  fund.
Ironically, when he or she gets to the university, they say:  No,  you  must
pay registration fees before you can  be  registered  with  the  fund.  That
becomes an impediment to the learner who has no means.

It would be a big mistake on our part if we did not say thank you  to  those
institutions of higher learning who responded to our call by  including  the
payment of registration fees in this fund. Others reduced registration  fees
from about R2 000 to about R500. In the House today we do have  some  people
from these institutions. We say thank you to them. To us, their action is  a
great contribution and a challenge to those who have not  done  anything  so
far, to follow the trend.

At present this fund assists 308 589 learners. Females  are  more  than  53%
and males count 46%. There  are  so  many  faculties  involved  that  it  is
difficult  to  remember  them  all,  but  I  will  cite  just  a   few.   In
administration and management studies  it  helps  29 498,  economics 32 253,
engineering 6 265, medicine 3 780, science 12 580. Thank you, ANC.

Minister Kader Asmal, it is not clear how many  of  the  students  receiving
assistance from this fund are disabled. When we want information  about  the
number of the disabled, we  are  told  that  institutions  do  not  indicate
whether a learner is disabled or not. The only type of  disability  that  is
indicated is that of the visually challenged, because they  use  thumbprints
instead of signatures. It is clear that the management board  of  this  fund
has not taken serious action with regard to the disabled. The Department  of
Education must take it to  task.  May  I  also  thank  former  students  who
benefited from this fund, who managed to complete  their  studies  and  have
now been able to make their repayments amounting to,  as  the  Minister  has
said earlier, R210 million.

I will now focus on the country's institutions of higher learning  and  talk
about management. In technikons black people at management level  amount  to
23%,  coloureds  16%,  Indians  7%,  whites  53%  and  women  only  19%.  At
universities the situation is quite  similar.  Minister  Kader  Asmal,  this
matter is a very serious  one.  Our  institutions  must  reflect  the  South
Africa we are in today. All of them must be managed  appropriately.  I  also
ask myself how many disabled there are at this level. If  the  situation  is
so hopeless with regard to females, I wonder how much worse  it  is  in  the
case of the disabled.

I would like to say that we  as  the  ANC  are  very  concerned  about  deaf
learners. They have a problem finding institutions with  educators  who  can
teach in sign language. In institutions of higher learning in  this  country
deaf students find themselves forced  to  resort  to  courses  they  neither
understand nor like. No! Students should not be hindered by disability.  The
administrations of higher learning institutions  must  look  at  this  issue
critically.

Another important issue is that of the brain gain. There  is  a  problem  in
our institutions here in South  Africa.  When  professionals  and  academics
from other countries such as Britain and  America  arrive  in  our  country,
they get a glorious reception but those who  come  from  countries  such  as
Cuba and Africa are taken as junior staff. We do not  even  hear  about  the
role played by professionals who volunteer to  come  and  work  here.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]]
Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, the whole educational  scene  in
South Africa has lately been dominated  by  one  major  issue:  religion  in
education. One could clearly see that this massive  reaction  made  the  hon
Minister look and feel like a punch-drunk boxer  receiving  one  blow  after
another from a source he never expected. This is no suprise. South  Africans
are serious about two things: their children  and  their  religion,  and  to
fiddle with both of them at the same time, then,  as  we  say  in  Afrikaans
``dan speel jy op Avbob se stoep''. [Then you're playing on Avbob's stoep.]

As my point of departure for my contribution to this debate I want to  refer
to something that happened yesterday - the  start  of  the  Boeremag  trial.
What is the connection, you may ask? The actions of  those  people  are  the
result of only one thing - extreme and fanatical  religious  radicalism  and
intolerance. And, you know what, they are a  marginalised  little  group  of
people on the outskirts of society, standing alone - maybe  with  a  lot  of
pity, but no support.

Why,  hon  Minister?  Because  South  Africans,  throughout  the   religious
spectrum, are not religious fanatics. South Africa has a  proud  history  of
religious tolerance. During all the years, even of  conflict  and  struggle,
we did not even have a glimpse of religious uproar or struggle,  or  marches
against religious oppression whatsoever. Yes, you may argue, white  churches
did support apartheid. But I know and you know  that  this  was  more  of  a
backdated attempt to justify it, than a stimulus to initiate it.

Hon Minister, the National Action party - the NA - appeals  to  you  not  to
disturb the tranquil waters of the religious ocean of  South  Africa.  Don't
allow education to become an instrument through which the  peaceful  way  in
which different denominations, and even different  faiths,  have  co-existed
in South Africa gets stirred up and messed up.

The NA has some serious  questions  regarding  the  department's  policy  on
religion in schools. Firstly, with regard  to  consultation,  you  met  with
various  religious  leaders,  but  the  most  important  stakeholders,   the
governing bodies, have not been included. In terms of the School's  Act,  it
is the governing bodies who must develop policies on  religious  observances
and mission statements for schools, not religious leaders. A structure,  the
consultative forum, which was established in 1999 to deal specifically  with
issues affecting governing bodies, was not consulted.  How  is  it  possible
that the very ones affected are not consulted?

Secondly, regarding  the  Minister's  basic  assumption,  a  vital  question
arises. Can any panel beating be usefully done to a policy  and  a  document
of which the basic assumption is wrong? This basic assumption  is  that  the
school is an instrument of the state. State support to nonstate  collectives
- such as public schools - does not convert such nonpolitical entities  into
state organs or internal parts of the state, as is incorrectly  affirmed  in
the published policy  on  religion  in  education.  Here  we  have  a  vital
difference in point of departure. Could the Minister clearly tell  us  today
if a public school is an organ of  state,  or  an  organ  of  civil  society
supported by the state.

Thirdly, you come with the argument that religion  and  religious  education
is the task of the home and the church. We agree to a certain  extent.  But,
hon Minister, isn't that the case with the basic  feeding  and  clothing  of
children? Surely those are the responsibilities of the  home?  But  what  do
you - and I commend you for this - when you see the reality of thousands  of
hungry children at school? Do you say: ``Sorry, son, dis jou pa se  werk  om
vir jou kos te gee''? [Sorry, son, it is your father's  job  to  feed  you.]
No, hon Minister, you have started a national feeding scheme of millions  of
rand.

But, sir, when it comes to little children starving for the  bread  of  life
because of disrupted families,  absent  parents,  do  you  give  the  order:
``Hands off! Don't feed this child. Dis sy pa se werk; and, dominee,  ``This
school ground belongs to the state; it is out of  bounds  for  you.  If  you
don't see this child on Sunday, well hard lines for you  and  for  him,  and
good luck for the devil.''? What inconsistency! [Laughter.]

The NA acknowledges the fact that there must be  order  and  authority.  But
why take away this authority from the instruments created by the  community,
statutory  bodies,  the  governing  bodies?  We  are  in  favour  of  order,
stability and authority, but not centralised state authority.

The futile distinction between religious education  and  religion  education
is the Achilles heel of the plan.

En nou gaan ek Afrikaans praat, meneer.  Die  verskillende  godsdienste  van
die  wêreld  word  hier  op  'n  ry  uitgepak.  Tussen  die  spyskaart   van
verskillende godsdienste staan daar iewers  ook  ``Christendom''.  Reeds  in
die junior-primêre fase moet leerlinge en ek haal  aan  ``die  mees  tasbare
vorme van godsdiens eksploreer soos gevind in kerke, moskees,  sinagoges  en
tempels''. In die primêre fase  moet  ``stories,  liedere,  heilige  plekke,
rituele en feeste van verskillende godsdienste'' bestudeer word.

Die basies-humanistiese dwaling is dat ``God'' uit ``godsdiens'' gehaal  kan
word, en laasgenoemde dan soos  'n  kadawer  oopgesny  en  gedissekteer  kan
word. U basiese fout  is  die  waan  dat  daar  so  iets  soos  neutraliteit
bestaan. Meneer, met hierdie hele beleid saal u 'n perd op wat  u  nie  gaan
ry nie. Ek  voorspel  'n  golf  van  lydelike  verset.  Ouers,  onderwysers,
kinders ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[And now I am going to speak Afrikaans, Sir. The different religions of  the
world ... On the  menu  of  different  religions  it  says  ``Christianity''
somewhere. Already in the junior  primary  phase  learners  have  to  and  I
qoute: ``die mees tasbare vorme van  godsdiens  eksploreer  soos  gevind  in
kerke, moskees, sinagoges en tempels.'' [Explore the most tangible forms  of
religion as found in churches, mosques,  synagogues  and  temples.]  In  the
primary phase ``stories, liedere, heilige  plekke,  rituele  en  feeste  van
verskillende godsdienste'' [stories, songs, holy places, rituals and  feasts
of different religions] must be studied.

The basic humanistic error is that God can be taken  out  of  religion,  and
that the latter can be cut open and dissected like  a  cadaver.  Your  basic
mistake is the delusion that something like  neutrality  exists.  Sir,  with
this entire policy you are saddling a horse  which  you  are  not  going  to
ride. I predict a wave of passive resistance.  Parents,  teachers,  children
...]

They are not going to march like they did in 1976. No, this will be  a  more
spontaneous defiance campaign, and it will not even be  organised.  How  are
you going to handle it? Are you going  to  fire  the  Grade  1  teacher  who
refuses to expose little children to the rituals of other religions, or  the
Grade 4 teacher who shows them Table Mountain and  says  how  wonderful  are
the works of God? Are you going to fail the thousands  of  excellent  pupils
whose parents say:  My  child  is  not  going  to  write  this  syncretistic
subject? Are you going to discipline the headmaster just  because  he  says:
Seuns en dogters, ons verwelkom vanoggend vir dominee so en  so  ...?  [Boys
and girls, we welcome reverend so and so this morning ...?]

Hon Minister, if something is not broken, don't try to fix it. I thank  you.
[Time expired.]

Mr R S NTULI: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  members,  the  demise  of  the
apartheid regime was lauded nationally and internationally as a victory  for
democracy  and  human  rights.   It   offered   unique   opportunities   and
responsibilities to  reconstruct  a  fragmented  and  deeply  discriminatory
education system, and to establish a unified national system underpinned  by
democracy,  equity  redress,  transparency  and   participation.   By   1999
systematic transformation in terms of policy was in place and, indeed,  this
was  a  great  achievement,  hon  Minister.  However,  the   challenges   of
implementation remained and abide with us even today.

Against this gloomy background the Minister outlined his call to  action  in
1999. This was operationalised in a plan known as Tirisano,  a  Tswana  word
meaning  ``working  together''.  The  plan  calls  for  the  massive  social
mobilisation of all stakeholders.

The focus areas were combating HIV/Aids; school  effectiveness  and  teacher
professionalism;  the  fight  against  illiteracy;  further  education   and
training  and  higher  education;  and  the  organisation  effectiveness  of
national and provincial systems. These are the five  broad  areas  that  the
Ministry set for itself, and we shall therefore focus on them.

There have been significant improvements in many  areas.  The  comparatively
good performance of the Grade 12 class of 2002 reflects that  the  schooling
system has stabilised. Thanks go to the efforts of the  Ministry  and  other
stakeholders. We  can  now  start  focusing  on  improving  quality  and  on
excellence in education, especially in critical learning areas  like  maths,
science, commerce and technology.  The  school  infrastructure  is  steadily
improving, but children in rural areas  continue  to  suffer.  For  most  of
these children, education is the only escape route from poverty.  Yet,  many
are exposed to learning in school buildings of inferior quality.

Underspending  by  some  provincial  education   departments   on   HIV/Aids
programmes continues to be  a  serious  source  of  concern.  The  nutrition
programme has, in many cases, been poorly managed, and we welcome  the  news
that in future it will be managed by the Department  of  Education,  instead
of the Department of Health which is simply not able to  get  its  house  in
order.

The quality of the schooling  system  can  only  improve  meaningfully,  hon
Minister, if there is an  integrated  approach  in  applying  the  appraisal
systems: Das - the developmental appraisal system, whole  school  evaluation
and systematic evaluation. Fortunately, there seems to be sufficient buying-
in by teacher unions, but the key word is delivery,  which  is  sadly  still
missing.

We should  consolidate  and  expand  centres  of  excellence  in  education,
whether they are in black areas, the former Model C schools  or  independent
schools. They hold the future for our children. As a  result,  the  national
education plan  to  outlaw  additional  remuneration  and  perks  by  school
governing bodies for excellent and hard-to-replace teachers is a  matter  of
serious concern - hence the  public  outcry.  Why?  Because  the  unintended
consequence of enforcing this legislation could lead to a  serious  loss  of
these rare skills.

The suggested route to follow is to offer incentives  to  such  teachers  to
move into those areas where their services are needed and to empower  school
governing bodies to retain all their teachers. If there is a need to  review
the relevant legislation, hon  Minister,  let  it  be  done.  The  buzzwords
should be to promote and nurture quality education. We share the  Minister's
concern with the need to avoid excessive  perks  and  the  need  for  proper
accountability by SGBs to parents. But these  issues  can  be  addressed  by
amending the relevant legislation.

We believe that with the right procedures and  less  bureaucratic  obstacles
we can end up with a win-win solution. It is worth noting  that  many  black
children are also benefiting from this quality education, especially in  the
former Model C schools. So the argument that this  is  rooted  in  promoting
historical white privilege is not valid. What this is,  is  for  the  common
good of all learners.

It is regrettable that there are still many schools in which  poor  learners
are still  wasting  their  time,  especially  in  the  Eastern  Cape.  These
learners are virtually on the road to nowhere.  How  can  a  learner  remain
positive and motivated in a school with a pass rate of less than  20%?  Yet,
we remain  hopeful,  thanks  to  the  co-operative  efforts  of  Government,
teacher unions and Sace, the SA Council for Educators.

The quality of further education and training and of higher  education  will
be enhanced if we can reach finality in curricular development  at  the  FET
level. Clearly, there is no proper articulation in  learning  areas  on  the
general education and training level, on the one hand, and  the  FET  level,
on the other hand. Current learners in Grades 10 to  12  are  following  the
traditional  curriculum,  though  taught  with  OBE  methodology.  We  would
appreciate an update by the hon Minister on these matters in his response.

Finally, the constant need to strengthen the system  with  sound,  effective
auxiliary services remains unresolved. Teachers need  professional  guidance
from subject experts. In this regard, the issue of  teacher  progression  or
promotion in the classroom environment could prove useful.
Teachers  and  learners  in  particular  are  also  subjected  to   enormous
emotional stress,  hence  the  need  to  expand  psychological  services  in
schools and also for educational  guidance  purposes.  I  thank  you.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R P Z VAN DEN HEEVER:  Chairperson,  part  of  my  focus  is  on  Further
Education and Training, in short, FET, as part of the Education Budget  Vote
debate today. The great majority of  learners  in  the  FET  sector  are  in
senior secondary schools in  Grades  10,  11  and  12,  and  many  study  in
colleges and through private providers.

Historically, schools have been oriented to academic approaches  and  higher
education, and colleges to vocational  programmes  and  the  workplace.  The
problems that  had  been  encountered  with  the  matric  course  at  senior
secondary level are that many schools  offered  subjects  which  had  little
relationship  to  the  needs  of  the  country   and   its   economy.   Many
matriculants, who did not possess vocational skills, struggled to find  jobs
in spite  of  attaining  a  matric  certificate.  Similarly,  our  technical
colleges were providing low-quality skills, and  many  young  people  joined
the  queues  of  the  unemployed  in  spite  of  attaining   their   college
qualification.
In spite of the constraints of the traditional matric system, the  Education
department has  attained  significant  success  in  improving  teaching  and
learning in our schools in order to  maintain  a  continuing  upward  trend,
culminating in a very satisfactory 68,9% matric pass rate which the  country
achieved last year.

In many of the matric subjects, matriculants throughout  the  country  wrote
the same examination paper. The exams were also based  on  interim  syllabi,
which had been cleansed of some of the racist undertones of  the  past,  and
vocational  education  had  been  extended  into  sections  of  the   school
curriculum. Many of the poorer  provinces  in  our  country  improved  their
results significantly. Most hearteningly, especially, were  the  significant
improvements recorded in mathematics and science.

In  the  wake  of  these  excellent  improvements  the  National  Curriculum
Statement on FET announced a major review, which is currently under way,  on
the structure of the curriculum and qualifications,  subject  offerings  and
human resource development. This review is being  done  in  the  context  of
imperatives for social and economic development and globalisation.
Another significant initiative in  the  area  of  FET  has  been  the  major
restructuring of the college sector. The new institutional  landscape  is  a
plan for  restructuring  the  present  152  technical  colleges  into  large
multisite FET colleges. The FET sector operates in close collaboration  with
the SA Qualifications Authority - Saqa -  which  is  the  custodian  of  the
National  Qualifications  Framework  which,  in  turn,   is   committed   to
supporting national priorities like the National Human Resource  Development
Strategy and the National Skills Development Strategy of the  Department  of
Labour.

Saqa's greatest challenge  is  to  remain  committed  to  ensuring  that  it
simultaneously develops the skills and innovations necessary for  addressing
the  national  development  agenda  and  for  participation  in  the  global
economy. One of the main  objectives  of  the  National  Skills  Development
Strategy is the fostering of skills development in the  formal  economy  for
productivity and employment growth.

The hon Doman asked that the curriculum be made more relevant for access  to
employment. This is exactly what the Government  is  trying  to  do  through
FET, the National Skills Development Strategy and adult basic education  and
training. I will now switch over to Afrikaans.

Die opposisiepartye het in hierdie  Begrotingsposdebat  verskeie  punte  van
kritiek aangesny waarop ek graag wil reageer.

Agb lid Doman was maar taamlik sinies vir 'n man wat sy nooienstoespraak  in
die Onderwysbegrotingsposdebat gehou het. Hy het op 'n baie slim manier  die
apartheidsnalatenskap probeer toesmeer deur te  sê  dat  baie  leerders  wie
kwalitatiewe swakhede het, het eers na 1994 tot  die  skool  toegetree.  Agb
Doman, dit gaan ons baie jare en geslagte neem om  die  skade  wat  u  mense
deur middel van apartheid aan die onderwys gedoen het, te  probeer  regstel.
Die feit dat u die skade wat reeds  gedoen  is,  probeer  geringskat  wakker
vermoedens aan dat u as apologeet vir  apartheid  optree.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
Ek kom na die alliansie toe, Lee.

Ek dink u party, die DA, het 'n wesenlike probleem.  In  wese  hunker  hulle
terug na die vleispotte van apartheid Suid-Afrika, maar hulle  kan  dit  nie
in soveel woorde sê  nie,  want  dan  word  hulle  uitgekryt  vir  die  ware
dissipels van baasskap wat hulle is. Nou kom  val  hulle  maar  met  mag  en
mening die transformasieprogram van die ANC aan.

Die DA of die Alliansie, mnr Lee is baie goed om te sê  wat  in  Suid-Afrika
onder die  ANC  verkeerd  is,  maar  hulle  kom  met  bittermin  realistiese
voorstelle vorendag wat die demokrasie in  die  land  verdiep  of  wat  nie-
rassisme in die land bevorder. Hulle beroemde ``fight back'' is niks  anders
as 'n geween en 'n gekners van tande nie.

Agb Martha Olckers het 'n hele paar  opbouende  opmerkings  gemaak.  Tog  is
daar  'n  hele  aantal  tergende  kwessies  wat  sy  opgehaal  het  wat   in
perspektief geplaas moet word. Kom ons neem nou maar  net  die  godsdiens-en
die onderwysvoorstelle waaroor mnr Green en mnr Aucamp ook  baie  gesê  het.
Die antwoorde vir baie van u punte van kritiek, agb Olckers staan  opgeteken
in die konsepdokument self.

U spreek die kommer uit  dat  die  onderwysers  wie  godsdiensonderwys  gaan
hanteer nie goed opgelei daarvoor sal wees nie. Die  konsepdokument  wei  'n
hele aantal paragrawe uit oor die belangrikheid  van  behoorlike  oplei  van
onderwysers en hoe daar met tersiêre inrigtings geskakel moet word om  seker
te maak dat ons die beste opleiding moontlik vir ons onderwysers kan kry.

Ek dink die Minister van Onderwys het 'n baie  deursigtige  en  demokratiese
proses gevolg met die hantering van die godsdiens en onderwysvoorstelle.  Hy
het die bevindinge van die adviesgroep gepubliseer en die  algemene  publiek
uitgenooi om hul menings te lug oor die betrokke voorstelle.

In 'n demokratiese kultuur sal mense dit verstaan dat die voorstelle nie  in
sement gegiet is nie; dat die departement juis die voorstelle  publiseer  om
die gevoel van die gemeenskap te toets oor die onderhawige kwessies en  baie
patriotiese Suid-Afrikaners  het  die  geleentheid  benut  om  baie  opregte
opinies oor die godsdiensvoorstelle uit te  spreek.  Nou  kom  die  Minister
vandag en sê dat  hy  binnekort  met  godsdiensleiers  ontmoet  om  van  die
kontensieuse aspekte van die  beleid  te  bespreek.  Ek  dink  dis  'n  baie
verantwoordelike benadering  waarvoor  die  Minister  ons  prys  behoort  te
verdien. [Applous.]

Agb Green, openbare skole is nie kerke nie. U kan  nie  skole  sien  as  die
plek waar u primêr wil kerk hou nie. Die konsepdokument erken  die  reg  van
ouers en kerke om kinders in 'n bepaalde kerkverband op te voed. Daarmee  is
daar  nie  'n  geveg  nie.  Dit  erken  ook  die  reg  van  gemeenskappe  om
onafhanklike kerkskole te stig. Dit sê maar  net  dat  godsdiensonderwys  in
openbare skole op so 'n manier hanteer moet word dat dit die  verskeidenheid
van geloofsoortuigings in die betrokke skool in ag moet neem.

Agb Green, uself was 'n onderwyser op  die  Kaapse  Vlakte  waar  Moslim  en
Christen leerders in dieselfde skool en in dieselfde klas  onderrig  ontvang
het. En u is bewus van  die  kreatiewe  maniere  wat  gevind  moes  word  om
hierdie twee hoofstrome in godsdiens binne dieselfde  skool  te  hanteer.  U
sal byvoorbeeld bekend wees met die praktyke wat op 'n Vrydag  by  skole  op
die Kaapse Vlakte hanteer word. Ek is verstom dat u nou  as  politikus  alle
rede  verloor  het  ten  opsigte  van  die  sensitiewe  hantering  van   die
verskillende gelowe op dieselfde skool en in dieselfde klas.

Wat die opposisie doen, in besonder  die  DA  en  die  ACDP,  hulle  kom  en
verpersoonlik die hele aangeleentheid rondom godsdiens in die onderwys  deur
vieslike persoonlike aanvalle op die karakter en  die  integriteit  van  die
Minister van Onderwys te loods. Dis mos 'n soort  gebreklike  politiek  dit.
Hoe sal ons ooit die  waardes  van  demokrasie,  toerekeningsvatbaarheid  en
deursigtigheid as edele  ideale  in  die  politiek  kan  vestig  met  so  'n
bedenklike  modus  operandi?  Dieselfde  bedenklike   strategie   word   met
entoesiastiese reëlmaat deur die opposisie toegepas op  kwessies  soos  taal
en die magte van skoolbeheerrade.

Weer  eens  probeer  die  opposisie   om   'n   eksklusiewe   werkswyse   in
onderwyinrigtings  te  bevorder,  hierdie   keer   op   die   beginsel   van
lesseaanbieding eksklusief in Afrikaans of bestuurstyle wat gebaseer  is  op
die geykte  Model  C-stelsel.  Terwyl  die  Regering  deur  middel  van  die
Grondwet landsburgers se  taalregte  beskerm,  gee  Opposisiegroepe  nie  'n
bloue duit om vir die verskynsel dat ons 'n land van baie verskillende  tale
is nie en dat openbare inrigtings soos skole  nie  onsensitief  met  hierdie
realiteit moet omgaan nie.

Die nuutste foefie is natuurlik om die Regering te blameer vir die feit  dat
skoolbeheerrade nie die salarisse van  verdienstelike  onderwysers  uit  eie
fondse kan verbeter nie. Daar was nog nooit so iets  in  openbare  skole  in
Suid-Afrika toegelaat nie. Selfs nie onder die  destydse  apartheidsregering
nie. Hierdie gebruik het sy  ontstaan  gehad  in  die  voormalige  Model  C-
skolebestel. In die onderwys vir swart, bruin en Indiër Suid-Afrikaners  was
daar nog nooit so iets  soos  die  salarisse  van  onderwysers  aanvul  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The opposition parties touched on a number of points of criticism to  which
I would like to respond in this debate on the Budget Vote.

Hon Member Doman was quite cynical for  someone  who  delivered  his  maiden
speech in the debate on the Education Budget Vote. In a very clever  way  he
tried to cover up the legacy of apartheid by saying that many learners  with
qualitative weaknesses only entered schools after 1994. Hon Doman,  it  will
take us many years and generations to try to remedy the damage  your  people
caused to education through apartheid. The fact that you tried  to  mitigate
the damage that had already been done gives rise to suspisions that you  are
acting as an apologist for apartheid. [Interjections.] I  will  get  to  the
alliance, Lee.

I think that your party, the DA, has an essential problem. In  essence  they
hanker after the fleshpots of apartheid South Africa, but  they  cannot  say
it in as many  words,  because  then  they  are  called  true  disciples  of
``baasskap'',  which  they  really  are.  Now   they   are   attacking   the
transformation programme of the ANC with might and main.

The DA, or the Alliance, Mr Lee, is very good when it comes to  saying  what
is wrong under the ANC in South Africa, but they  come  to  the  table  with
very few realistic proposals which will enhance democracy in the country  or
which will promote nonracialism in the country. Their famous ``fight  back''
is nothing but a crying and gnashing of teeth.

Hon Martha Olckers made a  number  of  constructive  remarks.  Nevertheless,
there are still a number of provoking issues which she raised that  must  be
put into perspective. Let  us  take  only  the  proposals  on  religion  and
education, on which Mr Green and Mr Aucamp also had  much  to  comment.  The
answers to many of these points of criticism, hon Olckers, are  included  in
the draft document itself.

You expressed the concern that the teachers who will be  handling  religious
instruction would not be trained well  for  doing  so.  The  draft  document
elaborated for quite a number of paragraphs on the importance of the  proper
training of teachers and how there must be consultation  with  the  tertiary
institutions to ensure that we can get the best possible  training  for  our
teachers.

I  think  the  Minister  of  Education  followed  a  very  transparent   and
democratic process in handling the proposals on religion and  education.  He
published the findings of the advisory group and invited the general  public
to air their views on the relevant proposals.

In a democratic culture, people will understand that the proposals  are  not
cast in stone, that the department specifically publishes the  proposals  to
test the feelings of society on the issues in question  and  many  patriotic
South Africans used the opportunity to express  heartfelt  opinions  on  the
proposals on religion. The Minister came along and said today that he  would
shortly meet with religious leaders to discuss contentious  aspects  of  the
policy. I think this is a very responsible approach, for which the  Minister
deserves our praise. [Applause.]

Hon Green, public schools are not churches. You  cannot  regard  schools  as
the place where you primarily want to conduct worship.  The  draft  document
acknowledged the right of parents and churches  to  educate  children  in  a
particular religious denomination. There is no argument about that. It  also
acknowledges the  right  of  communities  to  establish  independent  church
schools. This only says that religuos instruction in public schools must  be
handled in such a way  that  the  variety  of  religious  convictions  in  a
particular school are taken into consideration.

Hon Green, you yourself was a teacher on the Cape Flats,  where  Muslim  and
Christian learners received instruction in the same school and in  the  same
class. And you are aware of the creative ways which must be found to  handle
these two main  streams  of  religion  within  the  same  school.  You  will
therefore be familiar, for example, with the practices which are handled  at
schools on the Cape Flats on a  Friday.  I  am  astounded  that  now,  as  a
politician, you have lost all reason regarding  the  sensitive  handling  of
the different religions at the same school and in the same class.

What the opposition is  doing,  especially  the  DA  and  the  ACDP,  is  to
personalise the whole affair around  the  history  in  education  by  aiming
loathsome personal attacks on the character and integrity  of  the  Minister
of Education. Surely this is a distorted kind of politics. How will we  ever
establish the values of democracy, accountability and transparency as  noble
ideals in politics  with  such  a  questionable  modus  operandi?  The  same
questionable  strategy  is  applied  with  enthusiastic  regularity  by  the
opposition on issues like  language  and  the  powers  of  school  governing
boards.

Once again the opposition is trying to promote an exclusive  modus  operandi
in  educational  institutions,  this  time  on  the  principle  of   tuition
exclusively in Afrikaans or  management  styles  based  on  the  stereotyped
Model C schools. While the Government, by  means  of  the  Constitution,  is
trying to entrench citizens' language rights, the opposition groups  do  not
give a damn for the phenomenon that we  are  a  country  of  many  different
languages and that public institutions such as schools should not deal  with
this reality insensitively.

The latest gimmick, of course, is to blame the Government for the fact  that
school governing bodies cannot improve the salaries  of  deserving  teachers
out of their own funds. Such a  thing  has  never  been  allowed  in  public
schools in South Africa. Not even under  the  former  apartheid  government.
This practice had its origins in  the  former  Model  C  school  system.  In
education for black, coloured and Indian  South  Africans  there  has  never
been such a thing as augmenting teachers' salaries.]

The ANC is not averse to criticism. In fact, as the governing party  it  has
brought about a  transparent,  accountable  and  very  democratic  education
system in our country. It protects the religion,  language  and  culture  of
each citizen of this country through the universally acclaimed  Constitution
of South Africa.

However, the ANC will not deviate  from  its  course  of  transforming  this
country into a vibrant democracy  by  parties  who  want  to  sensationalise
every bit of  public  dissent,  to  which  our  people  are  entitled,  into
personal attacks on the integrity and respect of  the  Ministers  who  serve
this country with honour. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson  and  hon  members  of  the  National
Assembly, at my age there are very few consolations  in  life.  I  must  say
that the most important consolation in the past year has been this sense  of
excitement as to what we have been doing in my department.

I mentioned in my introduction that we are an unusual department in that  we
actually work collectively. There is very little  reverence  shown  for  the
Minister, I must say. That old tradition of deference that is  strong  among
the Indians and Afrikaners has disappeared in my  department.  Therefore  we
work very closely, tackle issues and change our minds. I think that this  is
the essence of internal debate, and a  sense  of  excitement  therefore  ...
[Interjections.] No, you were not here most of it. You look  like  a  verger
in a church or an ascetic vestryman, and I think you should  stick  to  that
job. [Laughter.] You dress like one. I'm trying to say ...  [Interjections.]
You see, he's never had a sense of excitement in his life.

I'm trying to say  what's  happened  this  year.  Regarding  the  issues  we
discussed, this year  for  example  we  proposed  that  there  should  be  a
national information and applications office for the 600 000 people  who  go
to higher education. That is a fantastic thing to do. We will be one of  the
first countries - five or  six  that  will  have  them  -  out  of  189  the
countries in the United Nations. Our kids - and I don't think this is  about
learners - in Grade 12 will have all the  information  they  want  about  36
institutions, or 21 institutions, by 2006. This is  opening  up  new  realms
and scholarships that are available.

In the same way, about the national  history  project  I'm  involved  in,  I
don't think the House knows that Unesco has given  us  the  rights  for  the
eight-volume history of Africa. We are publishing that  -  the  eight-volume
history of Africa. We are the first country to do so and  I  think  we  take
great pride in this, but pride  that's  not  offensive  because  it  doesn't
exclude anyone.

The Unesco history is a remarkable study written by scholars. It is not  the
lowest common denominator. If we can do that for history - it will  be  very
important - this will evolve now into a huge study on the  costs  of  books,
for example. Nobody  has  told  us  to  do  that.  It  comes  from  our  own
initiative to ask: What are the paper costs? What are  the  printing  costs?
What are the transport costs? What is the affect of VAT on books now?

At the same time,  we  can  look  at  all  these  matters  because  we  work
collectively. Our department attend the debates  here.  They  actually  have
debates. Even the DA takes part in the debates on trade  and  industry,  and
housing. I regret to say that what we have is a closed  mind  often  on  the
two issues that have been motivated in the debates here. There has  been  no
interaction. As the  hon  Leader  of  the  Opposition  said  when  he  spoke
movingly at the Sisulu commemoration, we mustn't shout  at  each  other.  We
should listen to each other.  And  there  is  very  little  illustration  of
listening to each other on the issues of  religion  and  education  and,  of
course, in relation to the governing bodies of schools and their functions.

So let me say therefore that there were 45  questions  addressed  to  me.  I
will write to every one of you, as I have done before. I'll provide  answers
to those questions. I can't, in fact, give you an analysis of these  matters
today, but we will do so. I have all your notes here.

Let me just say, with regard to reparations for apartheid  crimes,  that  we
must examine first of all the fact that apartheid education was  a  systemic
crime. It went right through and infiltrated every aspect  -  from  religion
to national service, to schools, commerce schools. And my criticism is  that
it  affected  black  South  Africans,  especially  Africans,   Indians   and
coloureds, but whites also.
So we have developed a response that looks at symbolic reparations.  How  do
you overcome the awesome legacy of Christian National Education? As a  token
of our remembrance we intend to commission a mural  for  our  new  building,
Sol Plaatje House, paid for by public subscription, which  will  record  the
struggles of this country for a united and democratic system of education.

I can assure the hon Mpontshane that  we  as  a  Government  recognise  that
gross violations of human rights affected not only the people  who  appeared
before the TRC but others too. However, we must in  fact  remember  that  we
must find different ways of providing reparation. The Zuma fund is going  to
be quite broad-minded in providing that.  It  is  an  appropriate  trust  to
provide this. So while the TRC Act envisages  pay  reparations,  we  believe
that all South Africans need some form of reparation  from  the  crime  that
was apartheid.

In relation to curriculum implementation, the hon Doman,  I  understand,  is
now the spokesperson for the DA. He raised many questions.  But  he  reminds
me of a bank manager who sits down in his office and the  client  comes  in.
He says, ``You know, this was a broken doll. The limbs were all broken  into
18 different sections.'' In 1996 we brought them together,  and  we  started
nourishing this doll, decorating the doll, adding  things  to  it.  And  the
bank manager says, ``Yes, but I have these pins. The first pin  I  am  going
to put in there, in the doll, is curriculum implementation.'' I'll come  and
look at this in a moment.

I'm compelled to say that the DA has lowered its standards by changing  from
the hon Ntuli - for four years we had him here - and replacing him with  the
new spokesperson, because I believe that he doesn't  know  very  much  about
education. [Interjections.] He will. He'll continue putting these pins  into
the doll we are creating, the doll which should  be  the  representation  of
all that's beautiful in our country. He'll continue putting pins  in  there.
He talks about raising standards, which I will come to in a moment.

Let me therefore take the hon member through the ``Baa,  baa  black  sheep''
of education, but I'd like him to repeat after me and recite  the  following
facts until he knows them by heart, since he is  opposed  to  outcomes-based
education. The teacher guides  have  been  produced  and  there  are  copies
available outside. They have been circulated. Hon Mr Doman, you should  come
out of this bank  manager's  office.  [Interjections.]  They  are  currently
being sent to schools in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  implementation
plan.

Secondly, teacher preparation has already commenced.  I  have  said  that  I
will not allow the  implementation  of  the  national  curriculum  statement
unless I am satisfied, not only the Council  of  Education  Ministers,  that
adequate training is taking place, that  learning  materials  are  available
and that teacher manuals are available. This is taking  place  already.  The
core team of academics, NGOs and departmental officials has spent  the  past
two weeks in training, and  all  provinces  -  all,  not  just  one  -  have
arranged for the training of the district officials during the month.

With regard to the training of teachers we have been careful not  to  assume
that teachers are unable to lead their own development and  build  on  their
own experiences of implementing OBE over the  past  five  years  -  as  that
lovely person from Matatiele shows.

In  relation  to  teacher  supply,  I'm  very  surprised  that  the  hon  Mr
Mpontshane said there is a surplus  and  bemoans  the  fact  that  qualified
teachers cannot find jobs while others are crying out about shortages. So  I
have asked the ministerial committee to work with Stats  SA  and  the  HSRC.
This is because when we do things in the ANC - when we have an inquiry -  we
do so out of a sense of confidence. We're not afraid of the consequences  of
the inquiry, as we did with outcomes-based education  when  we  started  off
four years ago. It was touching the ark of  the  covenant.  But  because  we
wanted to  make  sure  that  this  system  worked,  we  had  that  wonderful
committee looking at outcomes-based education.

So we do so out of self-confidence. The same thing applies here.  We'll  try
to find out what our teachers  needs  are,  rather  than  some  more  of  us
throwing bones - and I have more respect for some more of us throwing  bones
than somebody writing that the teaching population  will  be  devastated  in
the next four or five years,  particularly  in  KwaZulu-Natal.  So  we  will
carry  out  a  systematic  study  with  the  HSRC,  particularly  about  HIV
prevalence among teachers. The findings will be available - there you are  -
in August this year.

The matter of educator-to-learner ratios is  a  provincial  competency.  The
ratio we fixed is 1:40 for primary schools, and 1:35 for secondary  schools.
In fact, the provincial averages are much lower  than  that.  So,  in  other
words, we are building classrooms. We are building schools. As a  matter  of
interest, Mr  Mpontshane,  last  year  we  built  the  following  number  of
classrooms - and this is for Mr Doman too, if he  can  count.  Last  year  a
total of 3 750 classrooms were built.  [Interjections.]  Three  thousand  in
2002! This year 4 330 classrooms have been built; and a  further  4 700  are
to be built next year. The shortage we inherited in 1996 therefore  will  be
halved. [Applause.]

In the same way, 6 500 lavatories were built in  schools.  This  year  6 999
will be built - 7 473 toilets. We only started  this  three  or  four  years
ago. These may not seem to be large  numbers,  but  they  make  an  enormous
difference, as Mr Mpontshane said, to the lives of people who use them.

Similarly, 1 034 schools were electrified at a  cost  of  R59 million.  Next
year we are going to spend R101 million with Eskom. So we  are  making  this
very big dent. Only we can do it in the ANC because we have the  support  of
the people and the mobilising factors behind it. And we  must  never  ignore
that. I dealt with that very quickly.

Then, in relation to systemic evaluation, the report on the  performance  of
Grade 3 learners, which I initiated by the way,  came  out  of  a  sense  of
confidence because I was told that with outcomes-based  education  there  is
no assessment at all. As a former teacher I wouldn't  accept  that,  and  so
there is an assessment of Grades 3, 6 and 9 - but this  has  to  follow  the
process - in language and mathematics, which will be  released  on  10  June
following the  consideration  and  approval  by  the  Council  of  Education
Ministers on 9 June. Hon members are welcome to attend,  including  the  hon
Mr Doman, the curriculum plan for 10 and 11 June, where the report  will  be
presented and discussed.

So far from the hon member's imputation that we are afraid to  release  this
report, we are going to allow people to debate this  finding  and  encourage
them to understand the real challenges raised  by  this,  not  in  a  point-
scoring manner - not the bank manager putting pins into  the  doll  that  we
want to build - because we take these things very seriously.

In relation to the Tims study on mathematics, which South Africa  has  done,
this  study  is  influenced  by  many  factors,  including  the  number   of
participants, the influence of  language  -  which  my  Deputy  Minister  so
devastatingly referred to  -  because  language  proficiency  is  vital  for
proficiency in science and mathematics. I only  learnt  that,  by  the  way,
when I became Minister of Education. So even Ministers of  Education  at  my
age can learn things. There is no statistical significance in the change  of
two places between the two studies.

As far as the apartheid legacy is concerned, the hon Van den  Heever  looked
at it very carefully. But let me look at two legacies in  our  minds  -  and
they are the questions of standards and neutrality. You  see,  I  am  always
told that we are dumbing down standards. That  depends  on  which  interests
you are representing. The hon Ntuli is not here, so I  am  going  to  invite
the hon Doman to Groutville with me when I visit it.  Four  years  ago  they
had a 3% pass rate; three years ago they had an 8% pass rate; two years  ago
it went up to 30%; last year it stood at 82%.  The  new  principal,  who  is
highly motivated, comes from near my home town.

There is an interracial teaching group there - for the first time. So,  with
regard to dumbing  down,  it  depends  whose  standards  you  are  invoking.
Standards are not neutral. We want to create a culture of participation,  of
laughter and buoyancy in schools,  whereas  many  of  the  schools  you  are
talking about  that  have  high  standards  are  formalistic,  like  English
schools in about 1955. If you like that type of school, you are entitled  to
it, but I don't think there will be  any  creativity,  there  won't  be  any
development of the potential. I say this very seriously.

In relation  to  ethos,  whether  there  is  a  governing  body  or  not,  I
encountered this because every university told me - including the  Bantustan
universities, let me tell the hon  Azapo  member  -  ``We  have  a  peculiar
ethos. Our ethos is central.'' So we always asked them:  ``Can  you  explain
to us - it's a short Greek word, I think, with an enormous  meaning  -  what
this ethos is, the  value  system  you  are  talking  about?''  It  is  very
difficult to say  so  without  degenerating  into  very  self-indulgent  and
rather unhelpful assumptions.

I say it particularly here: What  happens  in  a  school,  as  is  happening
increasingly in South Africa - which has  now  become  multireligious  -  to
accommodate  different  interests?  I  think,  in  particular,  the  largest
Christian church in South Africa is a  Zion  church.  It's  been  demonised,
it's been excluded. The majority of the kids  are  from  the  ZCC,  and  the
governing body, which is controlled by a clique, demonises them. And  I  met
them and they said: ``For the first time, Minister, we might get  access  to
instruction after school hours. On the basis of equality we have never  been
allowed that.'' And the full force of the law is behind that.

I'm afraid, hon Cas Aucamp, whom I love very  much,  the  Constitution  says
I'm allowed to do that. He  says  that  now  the  family  and  religion  are
central. Two months ago - when he was villifying me -  he  said  the  family
and language are central. [Laughter.] I'm surprised by this. Now we  have  a
settlement over language. We have a real  settlement  over  language  now  -
language in the school. And remember, I'm the first  Minister  who  said  it
openingly, fundamental is the  mother-tongue  instruction.  It's  not  being
carried out in the African schools, although the hon Zille, when she was  an
MEC, questioned why we should have mother-tongue instruction. Why  shouldn't
we all learn in English?

So I say to you, therefore, that there are  a  number  ...  [Interjections.]
Well, I can tell you about that. There are a number of issues  we  can  talk
about. I will tell you - I'll write to you.  Can  I  say  that  some  people
said: Why didn't you leave things alone? Everything we do  is  by  reference
to ANC policy. If you don't like the policy, I'll remind  you  of  what  the
famous Groucho Marx once said: ``These are my principles. If you don't  like
them, I have others.'' [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 17:49.
