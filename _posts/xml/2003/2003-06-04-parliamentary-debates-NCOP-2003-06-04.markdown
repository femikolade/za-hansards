                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Madam Chair, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting
of this Council I shall propose:


  That the Council takes note that -


  (1) in 1999, the then Democratic Party gained twice as many votes in  the
       province of Mpumalanga as the New NP, and three times as  many  votes
       as the Freedom Front;


  (2) Clive  Hatch  rightfully  and  lawfully  became  the  leader  of  the
       opposition in Mpumalanga as  he  was  overwhelmingly  the  choice  of
       opposition voters in that province;


  (3) the Mpumalanga Provincial Legislature has now amended Rule 220 of the
       Provincial Rules and Orders, the effect of which  will  be  to  allow
       opposition MPLs to determine their own leader of the opposition, thus
       invalidating the choice of the voters;


  (4) the ANC was part and parcel of this process, reminding us that  their
       desire  to  totally  dominate  South  Africa  now  even  extends   to
       influencing who their opposition will be notwithstanding the will  of
       the voters; and


  (5) the New  NP's  participation  in  this  fiasco  not  only  undermines
       democracy,  but  also  demonstrates  that  there  is   no   practical
       difference remaining between them and the Government.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, at the next sitting  of  this  Council  I  shall
move that the Council notes that:


     (1)     the  ACDP  at  its  Federal  Council  meeting  has  ruled  that
         affirmative action as currently applied by the  Government  is  not
         fairly applied;


     (2)    the highest policy-making body of the ACDP ruled that  the  ACDP
         advocates changing  the  focus  from  previously  disadvantaged  to
         currently disadvantaged individuals, changing the  focus  from  the
         current racially discriminatory nature of affirmative action;


     (3)    many South  Africans  are  no  longer  disadvantaged  while  the
         majority is still poor and suffering - the  ACDP  will  focus  upon
         the genuinely needy, the disadvantaged and the poor;


     (4)    the ACDP policy-making body also recommended the creation of  an
         apartheid restitution fund to focus upon the social redress of  the
         apartheid system and that the fund should  provide  backing  for  a
         financial restitution claims process;


     (5)    the ACDP decided that it would put a timeline and sunset  clause
         on the whole process; and


     (6)    the ACDP said at its Federal Council meeting that it would focus
         not only on the wrongs of the past but also on the  wrongs  of  the
         present, flowing  from  the  impact  of  the  Government's  secular
         humanism programme.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                      Debate on Vote No 15 - Education:

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Chairperson and colleagues, I'm pleased  to
be here with colleagues from the provinces with whom I have a  good  working
relationship, in so doing accomplishing the imperatives and benefits of  co-
operative governance, especially during the discussion  and  debate  on  the
Education Budget Vote No 15.

Present today are  some  members  of  the  executive  councils  and  special
provincial delegates who are here not in their  party-political  capacities,
but with a mandate representing their provinces. So I hope  we  can  have  a
sincere debate, an open debate, without some of the silly posturing that  so
often prevails in the National Assembly.

I do not intend to duplicate my speech to the National Assembly.  Instead  I
would like to focus on issues that  relate  directly  to  education  in  the
provinces, including some of the measures that will improve the  quality  of
the education system provided and allow  for  greater  efficiencies  of  the
system.

Too often we do not pay enough attention to the progress  we  have  made  in
building our democracy and the institutions that  will  sustain  it  in  the
years ahead. There is no historic parallel in South Africa to  judge  change
and development, except that of democracy itself. This is  no  different  in
education. We have made some  extraordinarily  significant  strides  in  the
last nine years, not just in the quality  and  quantity  of  education,  but
also in respect of access to education, particularly targeting the poor  and
the previously disadvantaged groups in our country, who continue  to  remain
the disadvantaged, notwithstanding any statement  to  the  contrary  that  I
heard earlier.

And so may I commend to you, to all members here, if we're going to have  an
understandable debate, that we should look at the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review for 2005, where on page 51 they  deal  with  education,  province  by
province, and refer to the developments and the budgetary  aspects  province
by province. And this would be, therefore, the kind  of  guideline  I  shall
take into account, but, of course, not plagiarising  from  the  Minister  of
Finance.

So, for instance, if we look at what's happened, net  enrolment  in  primary
education in South Africa is now higher than 95%, which, believe it or  not,
is  higher  than  that  of  many  developed  countries.  And  the  developed
countries extend from the United States  to  France  and  even  to  Finland.
Another remarkable aspect is that since  1999  there  has  been  an  average
annual  increase  in  pass  rates  -  in  other  words  those  who  sat  the
examination and those who  passed  the  matriculation  examination  -  of  6
percentage points. In other words, the figure  went  from  a  pass  rate  of
48,8% in 1999 to 68,9% in 2002, with a greater number of exemptions.

The total provincial education  expenditure  increase  between  2002-03  and
2003-04 in constant rand terms is truly  substantial:  a  real  increase  of
R2,4 billion in  2003  rands,  which  is  R5,5  billion  in  nominal  rands,
reinforcing an upward trend in expenditure in education. During the  current
MTEF period expenditure is expected to  grow  by  2,7%  per  annum  in  real
terms. In other words, if the inflation was 8%, it would  then  be  a  10,7%
increase. So, it is a 2,7% increase in real terms.

During the current financial year  we  expect  to  spend  R58,9  billion  on
provinical education. Now R58,9 billion is more than  22%  of  our  national
Budget and more than 5,5% of our Gross National  Product.  These  are  truly
remarkable figures. And remember, this is a larger cake. Unlike  1994,  when
a large-ish cake was for about 15% or 16% of  the  population,  this  larger
cake is for 100% of the population.

Expenditure per learner in the schooling system has  increased  from  R3 234
in 1999 to R3 995 in 2000-01 and is estimated to increase to R4 437 in 2002-
03, although  individual  provinces'  budgets  are  under  pressure  due  to
personnel  spending  and  considerable  infrastructure  needs,  which   I'll
address shortly.

But you will recall, Madam Chairperson, that in 1994 the  expenditure  on  a
black child was one fifth of that on a white child. That was only  in  1994.
It is remarkable that in nine years we've been able to equate  this  and  we
will come, in fact, to  dealing  with  the  previously  disadvantaged  in  a
moment. So, pro-poor  funding  policies  from  national  to  provincial  and
within the education system for the funding norms are  working  and  showing
results. The challenge is to make output and learner achievement  also  more
equitably distributed in the system and in society.

A major part of our focus has been the introduction of the Revised  National
Curriculum  Statement  and  preparations  are  well  under   way   for   its
introduction in the foundation phase.  Now  we  have  the  Revised  National
Curriculum Statement here. This is the full statement about  curriculum.  It
is translated into 11 languages - which must be a world record  -  including
Braille. So this is a remarkable achievement  by  a  democratic  government.
We'll introduce grades slowly, Grades R to 3 next  year.  We're  taking  our
time.
This curriculum revision had two goals.  One  was  to  vastly  simplify  the
curriculum outcomes statements, so that all teachers can understand and  use
them properly. We have, therefore, teachers' guides for the development  and
learning programmes in the foundation phase.

So we are taking it very deliberately now. This, as I've told you, has  been
to ensure that there were no misunderstandings.  We've  provided  assessment
standards for each outcome to show teachers what should be expected at  each
grade level. I'm pleased to report there are now  very  explicit  statements
about being able to read and write. When I became Minister  there  wasn't  a
specific statement in the learning area that children at the end of Grade  3
should be expected to read and write. In addition,  we  have  provided  each
teacher with a guide which gives a huge amount of advice on turning  outcome
statements into learning programmes which are suitable for their pupils.  We
didn't do that before either, because we thought that  teachers  should  not
be given a framework or advice.

The other purpose of the curriculum revisions was to insert a much  stronger
emphasis on human rights, and I can assure Mr Durr  that  this  is  not  the
development of a secular, humanist  approach,  but  simply  to  reflect  the
constitutional assumption that our country  is  driven  by  the  fundamental
principles of equity, of equality, and of freedom. Of  course  the  founding
principles are equality, freedom  and  dignity.  These  are  the  foundation
ones.  If  that  makes  us  humanist,  we  plead  guilty.  If  it  makes  us
secularist, we do not  plead  guilty,  because  the  fundamental  assumption
there is in fact a value system that drives us. The value system may not  be
approved of by former National Party supporters, but  it's  a  value  system
that's very important.

So, there is an emphasis  on  human  rights,  on  inclusivity,  and  on  the
celebration of our diversity. And where  previously  our  diversity  was  an
instrument of  subjugation  and  subordination,  our  diversity  now  is  an
occasion for celebration. So in future children will learn much  more  about
our wonderful country, not just its physical geography, but its history  and
its soul as well. They must know how it has come  about,  the  battles  that
have been fought around ownership and the values which we now  share,  along
with this land, as inscribed in our Constitution and in the Freedom  Charter
with the very proud claim that South Africa belongs to all  those  who  live
in it, black and white.

We have delivered boxes of copies  of  the  curriculum  statement  to  every
school. Additional copies are  currently  being  sent  to  every  foundation
phase teacher. I would like to ask members of this Council - because I  made
this appeal before, three or four years ago - that  we  must  work  jointly,
together in this, to do a service to the  constituencies  by  checking  that
these documents are indeed getting to the schools and to  the  teachers  and
are not stored in the principal's office or in some district office.

If there are any difficulties and schools seem not to have received them,  I
invite you to  contact  my  office  directly  so  that  the  matter  can  be
investigated and in fact dealt with. We cannot afford to  have  any  schools
without the right documents because this time we are very deliberate in  how
we are introducing a curriculum statement that can last  this  country  from
40 to 50 years.

To prepare our foundation phase teachers for next year, we have appointed  a
core  team  of  20  people   -   academics,   members   of   nongovernmental
organisations and departmental  officials  -  who  are  currently  providing
training to our curriculum officials. These  are  provincial  and  district-
based subject advisory staff, who must lead the  implementation  process  in
their areas. Similar training will be given to school principals.

The Government's going to spend over R240 million, every  year,  to  bolster
up and maintain the administrative capacity of  our  schools.  So  we  would
have spent, in the last three or four years,  about  half  a  billion  rand.
Now, this is delivery; this is change. It's undramatic; it doesn't get  onto
the front page of newspapers, but it's having an enormous effect. Now  these
will also be expected to provide instructional  leadership  to  teachers  in
their schools in each instance. The teacher guide, which I have referred  to
already,  will  form  the  basis  of  the  training.  The  message  will  be
consistent throughout the country.

In respect of early childhood development - and I'm  not  repeating  what  I
said last year about other areas - we've started a process to roll  out  the
implementation of Grade R, the  school  reception  year.  I  am  pleased  to
report that we are on schedule with this  process  and  to  date  more  than
200 000 children are now enrolled  in  Grade  R  at  schools  and  community
facilities around the country. This should increase by 10% to 20% each  year
over the next six or seven years. By 2010, as we  promised,  we  expect  the
full complement of approximately 1 million Grade R pupils  will  be  catered
for, thus fulfilling our promise of 10 years of compulsory education.

I am pleased to report that at present thousands of Grade R kits  are  being
distributed around the country and the  training  and  upgrading  of  4  500
practitioners in all provinces is about to commence.

One of the most significant investigations carried out by the Department  of
Education to date has been the  Review  of  the  Financing,  Resourcing  and
Costs of Education  in  Public  Schools  study,  which  will  next  week  be
considered by the Cabinet. It was this morning enthusiastically received  by
a joint Cabinet committee and next week it will go to the Cabinet.

The report identified, firstly, key ways  in  which  we  could  enhance  the
system  more  or  less  within  the  current  budget  and,  secondly,  where
budgetary shifts are  vital  for  improving  the  situation  in  our  public
schools. The most  important  and  crucial  intervention  arising  from  the
review is the implementation  of  a  national  poverty-targeting  framework.
Currently, nonpersonnel recurrent allocations are distributed  according  to
provincial poverty-targeting lists, the result of which is that the  poorest
20% of learners in a particular province may not be at  the  same  level  of
poverty as the poorest 20% of learners in another province.

I have before me a table prepared by my department which shows that  in  the
Eastern Cape 60% of the children are in the poorest percentile  -  not  20%.
In the Western Cape it's 4%. It's  4%  in  the  Western  Cape.  The  funding
formula that treats unlike as  like  results  in  increasing  pauperisation,
increasing poverty and  increasing  alienation.  So  we  want  a  framework.
Provincial departments would then develop a  provincial  resource  targeting
list by ranking schools according to the poverty of the  communities  around
the school. Provinces then would allocate a normed  per-learner  amount  for
nonpersonnel recurrent school expenditure according to the national  poverty
groupings.

In other words, there would be a national norm,  whether  the  child  is  in
Ingwavuma or Tzaneen or Port Nolloth. And the national norm will  take  into
account the poverty of the community around them. We estimate that no  child
should be attending school unless there is  a  target  allocation  of  about
R450 per child. Of course, that's the poorest one. We hope it will  increase
next year and the year after that, and then of  course  the  maximum  figure
will be about R740.

In the present situation there are children obtaining, say in Gauteng,  R450
per child and in another province R50 per child. We cannot tolerate this  in
a democratic society.  There  is  no  equity;  whatever  our  constitutional
arrangements, we cannot in fact tolerate this kind of thing.

In addition, during 2003 a system  of  post  provisioning  for  schools  was
introduced that takes into account  the  relative  level  of  poverty  of  a
school.  This  was  aimed  at  ensuring  that  learners  who  come  from   a
particularly poor background have the benefit  of  smaller  classes.  That's
important. Poverty is regarded as a barrier to learning  and  the  provision
of smaller classes to these  learners  is  aimed  at  compensating  for  the
barrier. The post provisioning policy makes provision  for  the  top-slicing
by a department of  a  maximum  of  5%  of  its  total  pool  of  posts  and
allocating these top-sliced  posts  to  schools  in  accordance  with  their
relative levels of poverty.

For 2003, the various provincial departments  have  effected  top-slices  of
between 2% and 5%, resulting in a total shift of approximately 3  000  posts
- not yet 5% - throughout the country to  the  poorer  schools.  This  means
that the governing bodies and the principals can now say:  We'll  now  have,
for the first time, an art teacher; an art teacher  teaching  history  also.
For the first time we can have a music teacher who can teach mathematics  at
the same time. Or we'll have two mathematics teachers for  the  first  time.
But we're only moving towards 5% biased  in  favour.  Now  that's  delivery,
Madam Chairperson.

We have also paid attention to  the  improvement  of  school  infrastructure
with Government's commitment to extensive  increases  in  education  capital
budgets. The provincial education capital budget was  R2,1  billion  in  the
2002-03 financial year, which has increased to R2,5 billion in  2003-04  and
is estimated to increase to R3,2 billion in 2004-05.

Remember, there is R100 billion allocated in the budget  for  infrastructure
development. I'm going to ask all the  provincial  MECs  and  the  heads  of
departments to ensure that we put in our claim for that so that at  the  end
of this MTEF period no child will have to learn  in  dangerous  schools,  in
dangerous mud schools and in overheated schools anymore. And of  course,  it
is up to the provinces to tell me whether there are children learning  under
trees. And I will not take an  answer  to  the  effect  that  there  are  no
children learning under trees, because we learn from newspapers  that  there
are children learning under trees. The money is there now. Let's  have  your
commitment and your information so that we can go ahead. [Applause.]

 So,  emphasis  on  classrooom  and  infrastructure  provision  has  reduced
classroom backlogs to such an extent that the problem of  educators  without
classrooms has been considerably reduced. It has not been  abolished,  as  I
found, when there are children in  Port  Elizabeth  who  are  not  attending
school because there is no place for them in those schools this year.  I  am
pleased  to  announce  that  3  750  classrooms  were  built  by  provincial
departments of education during 2002 and 2003 in  an  attempt  to  eliminate
situations in which students were learning under  dangerous  conditions,  in
the open air or in overcrowded and unacceptable structures.

An estimated total of 12 828 classrooms will be built in the period  2002-03
to 2004-05. At the end of the current MTEF period, the classroom backlog  is
estimated to drop to 30 000 from a recorded shortage of 65 000 in 1996.  So,
in six to seven years we have halved the shortage of classrooms.

Nationally, 1 034 schools were  electrified  during  the  current  financial
year by October 2002. The allocation of R59 million to Eskom in 2002-03  for
the Schools and Clinics Electrification  Programme  has  been  increased  to
R101 million next year to further accelerate the electrification of  schools
and clinics. Well, again we've delivered.

Other  infrastructure  elements  such  as  water,  toilets  and  sanitation,
textbooks and telecommunications and IT infrastructure  have  been  expanded
to ensure that learners, nine years after the democratic transition  in  our
country, have access to more services at school than ever before.

When I became the Minister of Education  four  and  a  half  years  ago,  we
allocated R350 million for learning  material.  This  year  it  will  be  R2
billion for learning material. Once again it's for the provinces  to  ensure
that at the end of this year every school - 27  000  schools,  after  all  -
will have their learning materials. We are trying now  to  co-ordinate  this
nationally, so that the poor publishers don't have to  depend  on  a  junior
official telling them in  November  we  want  so  many  textbooks  for  this
purpose or the other.

Children cannot learn on an empty stomach. As you may be aware, the  Primary
Schools Nutrition Programme is an  important  element  of  the  strategy  to
combat poverty. This year it has increased to R800 million and next year  it
will be R1 billion. It will be transferred from the Department of Health  to
the Department of Education during  2004.  Preparations  for  this  transfer
began in 2002, and we are confident that Government will be  in  a  position
to move closer to its target of providing nutritious  lunches  to  all  poor
learners on every school day of the year. During 2004 we intend  to  realise
our target of providing a nutritious meal to 20% of learners on  a  pro-poor
basis on every school day.

Of course we will soon set up a mechanism whereby schools will  be  able  to
apply for funding to provide lunches  for  learners  in  schools  not  fully
covered in the programme. Again, I ask my comrades  and  colleagues  in  the
provinces. Eligibility for poverty-based grants will be used as a  criterion
for eligibility for publicly funded  lunches.  We're  working  closely  with
social development. This is called joined-up Government and we're doing  it.
Can I appeal to the MECs and the provinces to ensure that they work out  now
- for they'll be implementing this - the programme to target the poorest  in
each province. I don't  wish  to  go  to  Ingwavuma  as  I  did  last  year.
Ingwavuma is one of the poorest parts of South Africa and there hadn't  been
a school feeding scheme in Ingwavuma for months and months.

There have been one hundred and ninety-six days of proper nutrition.  May  I
celebrate a remarkable headmistress from Atteridgeville who says it  is  not
enough to give peanut butter and white bread. She has  now  grown  a  garden
with the mamas around the school. The children get a hot  meal  prepared  by
these mamas and the principal. This is the new South Africa. [Applause.]  We
want that replicated. We're waiting on  the  World  Health  Organisation  to
work out how we can get school gardens  so  that  they  can  supplement  the
nutrition provided by the state.

 Let us now turn quickly to further education  and  training,  and  for  the
first time in this  Council  we  will  actually  be  talking  about  further
education and training in  detail.  In  the  latter  part  of  last  year  I
declared 2003 the year of further education and  training  and  therefore  I
will deal with this element of our mandate in  somewhat  more  detail.  This
was aimed at enhancing the FET band in general and the  FET  college  sector
in particular.

In October last year I released the draft National Curriculum Statement  for
Grades 10-12 for public comment. Public comments were incorporated into  the
National Curriculum Statement which we are considering. On 14 February  2003
I announced that the new National  Curriculum  Statement  for  Grades  10-12
would be implemented in Grade 10 in 2006. I indicated, and I should like  to
repeat in this Council, that the new curriculum can only be  implemented  if
there is  adequate  preparation  of  teachers,  and  learning  and  teaching
support materials, including quality textbooks. If we don't have that -  and
my director-general is here - we are not proceeding with the  implementation
for Grade 10 in 2006.

Provincial departments of education have a  crucial  role  to  play  in  the
implementation of the National  Curriculum  Statement.  While  the  national
Department of Education will give guidance in  terms  of  how  best  we  can
prepare  for  implementation,  the  primary  role  of  preparing   for   and
implementing the curriculum rests  with  the  provinces.  Forgive  me  if  I
concentrate on an area that has long required our  attention  and  which  is
vital for the development of our human resource capacity.

On 15 may 2003 I launched the 50 new public further education  and  training
colleges. I said  at  the  launch  that  the  FET  colleges  have  been  the
Cinderella of our education and training system. There was no  midnight  for
them when they could change themselves. This situation obviously  could  not
continue if we are to develop the colleges into  modern  institutions  which
meet the demands of a postapartheid society in the 21st century.

The setting up of management structures is proceeding in  all  50  colleges.
College principals have been appointed at all colleges in six provinces  and
the process will shortly be completed in  the  other  three  provinces.  And
they  will  be  called  chief  executive  officers,  not   principals.   The
appointment of  157  college  senior  managers  is  proceeding  as  planned,
because we want good administration. If Batho Pele is to mean anything  then
we must have good trained managers.

In the last quarter of this year colleges will be busy with  the  completion
of the restructuring process with the development of new organograms. And  I
hope we don't take the organogram in  the  office  of  the  premier  in  the
Eastern Cape. Staff will be absorbed into the new college structures,  based
on Resolution 7 of 2002 of the Public Service Bargaining Council.

The Department  of  Education,  through  our  private  sector  partners,  is
currently running a series of training programmes directed at  the  colleges
in each province. These are aimed at  establishing  the  basic  capacity  to
handle change management, curriculum development - because it  is  a  brand-
new curriculum  for  these  technical  colleges  -  strategic  planning  and
quality assurance. Nothing but the best is good enough for the  intermediate
education which we are now totally renewing.

My department is currently working on determining the resource  requirements
for the FET college sector. We have engaged provinces in  discussions  on  a
possible adjustment of per capita allocations for  a  new  funding  formula.
This  will  facilitate  an  effective   handover   of   accountability   and
responsibility to the new principals  as  required  by  the  Public  Finance
Management Act.

Currently the  FET  college  sector  is  allocated  only  2%  in  provincial
education budgets. I have  set,  together  with  the  Council  of  Education
Ministers, a target to double this  figure  in  five  years.  We  have  also
targeted efficiency gains of 5% each year as well as an annual  5%  increase
in student enrolments, which we have now already exceeded by this year.

 So the FET college  sector  has  to  expand  its  learning  programmes  and
qualifications.  Such  an  expansion  will  largely  come  from   demand-led
courses. Currently we have 208 Seta-related courses in 29 of  our  colleges,
with over 2 000 learners enrolled in them, which again is a big change.
We have begun with the implementation of a strategy to  phase  out  the  old
college curricula. A new  qualifications  policy  framework  will  establish
college clusters across  the  various  organising  fields  of  the  National
Curriculum Framework. It will also put into place a mechanism  for  the  new
colleges  to  begin  developing  and  delivering  responsive  and   relevant
vocational qualifications and programmes.

Last week I went to four or five of the colleges in the  Gauteng  area  with
their subdivisions. It  is  remarkable  that  Randburg  College,  which  was
exclusively a white organisation prior to 1994, is  working  hand  in  glove
with  Alexandra  College  and  sharing  the  facilities.  This  is   a   new
development in South Africa. Separated by a national highway  which  created
two distinct colleges, one highly privileged and one less  privileged,  they
are now working together and black students are doing art courses and  white
students are doing herb extract courses provided  by  Alexandra.  These  are
the kinds of new South African establishments we want. This is a new way  of
doing things and is of course deracialising our  institutions  at  the  same
time.

So institutional programme niches have been identified  and  linked  to  the
MTEF through the current strategic planning processes. There will  be  great
innovation and co-operation, and provinces will play an  important  role  in
identifying further innovative programmes which  would  address  the  social
and economic needs of specific regions in the provinces. In addition,  these
colleges will  work  very  closely  with  business,  because  the  needs  of
locality logistics differ from one part of South Africa  to  another.  I  am
very grateful to Business SA, through the national business initiative,  for
putting in R100 million into the reorganisation of these technical  colleges
and the training of more than 150 managers who were sent  overseas  to  come
back to South Africa to administer these institutions.

So, alongside the developments I have mentioned above, the phasing in  of  a
new information system is under way. To assist colleges which  do  not  have
the minimum information technology base to supply the system  with  data,  a
R50 000 grant is available to establish such a base. And so we  have  urgent
priorities to look at next year.

For the first time we  want  student  support  services,  including  student
financial aid, at the technical colleges. We want  the  provinces  to  renew
the bursaries they had before 1994, because for  some  odd  reason  many  of
them have disappeared. We are thinking nationally: Can the National  Student
Financial Aid Scheme for higher education be used for technical colleges?

About 123 000 full-time students are at  technical  colleges,  but  600  000
have higher education. It should be the other way around.  We  should  have,
proportionately, 1 million in further education  and  training.  That's  the
intermediate skills base for South Africa. But our snobbery of looking  down
on any kind of work done with  the  hands,  brings  us  down.  There  was  a
wonderful old man with a big beard in 1848, who wrote a  famous  book,  that
people have forgotten nowadays but that remains relevant. He said the  worst
thing a bourgeois society can do is to separate  working  with  one's  hands
and working with one's brain. The ingqondo [mind] must  come  together  with
the hands. And we must bring back into our system respect for work  of  that
type, also because there is more money in that. To be a plumber today  means
one could earn, in five or six years' time, more money,  certainly,  than  a
Minister can manage.

And so we will have the public-private partnerships for  technical  colleges
and I hope the provinces will expedite these  issues  with  all  the  vigour
they deserve. Of course they have worked enormously well.  Where  there  has
been tension with 152 colleges reduced to 50, without everybody  taking  the
front page of the newspaper saying autonomy has  been  destroyed,  our  work
has been destroyed. They all know now that we can have the beginnings  of  a
college system of technical education for our children for the  first  time.
Now that's because the ANC-led Government took the  initiative  to  do  that
and sat on vested interests. We have to sit on vested  interests,  otherwise
the courage, the resilience, the tenacity which came  from  the  ANC  policy
formulation would be wasted. Nobody else could have done  this  as  the  ANC
Government did.

Let me turn to topical issues very quickly. I have  been  surprised  by  the
reaction from some quarters to  our  draft  Religion  in  Education  policy,
partly because so much public comment  has  been  based  on  misinformation,
malice and hearsay and partly because there are clearly people  who  do  not
understand and recognise the enormous diversity of our country, and more  so
the religious diversity of our country.

I met with the National Religious Leaders Forum late last  week.  It  was  a
wonderful meeting where we  discussed  the  draft  policy.  We  had  a  most
congenial and open exchange of views in which there was  a  general  meeting
of minds in respect of the various issues. So I agreed with them that  there
would be further discussions, not necessarily in person, when the  finalised
policy comes out. They want to be involved in the implementation at  schools
of the curriculum aspects of  religion  in  education,  which  you  know  is
already being implemented from Grades R to 9.

The religious community themselves indicated that  they  were  encouraged  -
Bishop Mdladlana wrote to me yesterday - by a greater sense of openness  and
transparency and their increased involvement in the consultation process.

In respect of another issue: There has  been  some  comment  in  the  press,
especially in the Western Cape, about  the  draft  amendment  to  the  South
African  Schools  Act  regarding  additional  remuneration  paid  by  school
governing bodies  to  teachers  employed  in  terms  of  the  Employment  of
Educators Act. This is in  reply  to  those  posts  created  by  the  school
governing body. Regrettably, the outcry  from  certain  quarters  failed  to
realise that  this  was  not  something  new.  Already  teachers  have  been
regulated in terms of the earning of  additional  remuneration  since  1998.
All the amendment is trying to achieve is to align the two Acts to place  as
much responsibility on the school governing bodies as on  the  teachers.  At
present the responsibility is on the teachers.

We are currently looking at the various submissions  we  have  received  and
next week I  will  be  putting  a  proposal  to  the  Council  of  Education
Ministers based on the representations we have received. My primary  concern
is  to  have  a  system  that  is  just,  and  that  functions  effectively,
efficiently and fairly.

There was a suggestion in the press that I would back off  the  legislation,
somehow change my mind or reverse the decision. I see that the  New  NP  has
had a conference on religion in education and it says in The Argus that  the
national Government is backtracking - whatever that  means  -  on  religious
observance at schools. The school governing bodies will be able to  do  this
and the Government therefore is in fact  rejecting  its  earlier  proposals.
This is not how we work. This is really a "damned if you do, damned  if  you
don't" scenario.

The whole idea of broad-based consultation  with  the  public  and  relevant
role-players - something I have  employed  extensively  during  my  term  in
office - is to seek ideas about how our various proposals  can  be  improved
and implemented. Yet, if we don't  take  into  account  the  submissions  we
received we  are  accused  of  being  headstrong  or  trying  to  centralise
everything, which I see in The Citizen, which has become an  organ  for  the
DA. The DA leader has said we want to take over all the parts. But  when  we
do take the view into consideration we are regarded as backing  down.  Well,
truth be told, we consult out of confidence.  Those  who  don't  have  self-
confidence don't consult; they just do what they want to do. Truth be  told,
I do not worry about either of these allegations,  as  long  as  we  get  it
right in the final analysis.

We represent the broad spectrum of our people.  We  represent  the  broadest
constituency of a very broad  church,  which  does  not  take  into  account
sectoral and sectarian interest of the type we're talking about.

Notwithstanding the need for some changes to legislation, our country has  a
system of school governance that is the envy of many countries.  Our  school
governing bodies allow for greater participation in the life of the  schools
by all sectors of school communities. We are proud to say that this  is  the
third round of elections and I hope public representatives will  be  closely
involved in assisting schools, particularly in  the  rural  areas,  to  hold
their elections.

 The South African Schools Act deals with the regulations and powers of  the
school governing body to make decisions  in  respect  of  policies  such  as
school fees, school  development  plans,  school  policy,  language  policy,
educator appointments and the custodianship of  school  moneys.  Recently  I
appointed a team of independent  persons  to  review  our  school  governing
system - every structure we have set. Suddenly now people  think  that  they
invented  the  school  governing  body.  It  was  Blade  Nzimande   and   my
predecessor, the Minister of Education, and the ANC who  insisted  on  local
self-governance. We will not take any lessons from anyone  who  thinks  that
we want to restrict the school governing bodies. They are our creation,  and
we are very proud of this.

This review now, on the other hand, is inspired by  concerns  that  some  of
our school governing bodies are operating outside the spirit - and  possibly
the letter - of  our  Constitution,  by  denying  many  students  access  to
schooling often by using money and  language  as  a  barrier  to  admission.
Others are not managing their  financial  affairs  in  accordance  with  the
regulations, like the infamous case in Ermelo when they gave huge  gifts  to
the principal of services and groceries,  and  other  forms  of  assistance.
They are not living within the space that the school governing body and  the
parents must run the finances. If there are these blemishes, we  shall  deal
with them.

So in reviewing our school governing bodies we need to think  laterally  and
also learn from the best practice of other countries. We need  to  consider,
for example,  the  advisability  of  circuit-wide  or  district-wide  school
governing bodies. One might even consider the formal  involvement  of  local
government in our school governance.  And  why  not?  At  another  level  of
management my Ministry has prioritised the establishment of the  development
education districts. Districts have a crucial role to play in  the  delivery
of education services, because they are close to schools and  FET  colleges.
They are best placed to monitor and support  what  happens  at  schools  and
colleges.

I am certain, after my visits to other countries, that many of our  district
officers are less than satisfactory in their  operations.  They  don't  know
the law. They don't know  the  practice.  They  often  don't  know  what  is
happening in the schools, as I found out when I went to  the  Eastern  Cape.
The children had dismissed two principals, who were women, and the  district
official didn't know about it. I promptly said that  they  couldn't  do  it.
One of the women in Dimbaza, which has an emotional resonance for  me  -  we
made a film in exile - was kicked out of the Western Cape at the age of  12,
put on a train and sent to Dimbaza. She is now  the  acting  principal.  The
kids had the cheek to dismiss her predecessor.

So, district  officials  now  have  to  be  trained,  educated  and  as  the
President has said, if they can't perform  their  functions,  they  must  be
kicked out. They must be dismissed. The district officials are the heart  of
our education system. So, the limitations placed there are very serious.

I have noticed with concern the recent media reports  on  what  is  seen  as
declining  safety  and  security  in  our  schools.  Several  instances   of
intimidation, harassment, stabbing and shooting have  been  reported.  I  am
very pleased to say that all provinces now have a first-class  programme  of
safety  in  schools,  and  they  are  implementing  these  programmes,  some
provinces better than others.

It is vital that the community has a sense that  they  must  be  behind  the
schools. You can't make schools fortresses as they have done in  the  United
States. There are still serial killings in the United  States,  even  though
they have fortresses and they have gun checks  and  things  like  that.  You
can't do that. A school must have a sense of solidarity with other  schools,
with the community. There must be active involvement.

What we must do, on the other hand, is to take precautions. I am pleased  to
announce that over the last four or five years, thousands  of  schools  have
been fenced, which is a very important  development.  Fencing  is  vital  to
keep people away from the school who go there  randomly  to  interfere  with
the school. We can't adopt overzealous methods. We can't, in  fact,  do  the
kinds of things other countries have done, which I reject.

I end by referring to one issue, namely HIV/Aids. Over the past  years,  the
education response to HIV/Aids has gained momentum.  Education  has  assumed
its role at the heart of the national response to  HIV/Aids.  You  may  have
read the Mandela Foundation and the HSRC report in which it's quite  clearly
said that 84% of those aged between 12 and 24  learnt  about  HIV/Aids  from
schools. Interestingly enough, about 12% of those between  50  and  65  also
learnt about HIV/Aids from schools. Obviously,  it's  working  down  through
the children. There is evidence that our efforts are bearing fruit. We  have
reason to be optimistic.

Overall, we must  continue  to  promote  and  celebrate  excellence  in  our
schools. The excellence of our schools as displayed in  the  matric  results
is not limited to the leafy suburbs of  South  Africa.  Some  of  the  best-
performing schools in terms of matriculation exemptions came from very  poor
township areas  and  rural  areas.  Some  of  the  rural  schools  have  won
scientific awards, which is  really  remarkable.  Therefore,  when  we  talk
about excellence, we should not limit our horizons. So, we want  to  promote
excellence in the townships and rural schools, the inner city areas and  the
leafy suburbs of  South  Africa.  Let's  make  a  commitment  that  when  we
celebrate excellence,  we  also  ensure  that  our  brightest  children  are
identified and therefore receive the special support they need. That is  why
outcomes-based education, by collective work, will ensure that we  are  able
to identify brighter children in mathematics and  science  and  history,  so
that we can give them special attention for further education.

With  our  newly  implemented  Whole  School  Evaluation   and   Development
Appraisal Systems, we will have a good sense of where the  real  quality  is
and where there is a need for improvement. You will  be  surprised  when  we
begin to tell you where the real  quality  in  South  Africa  can  often  be
identified.

Let me say that I am pleased to report that, with a  few  exceptions,  there
is excellent and on the most part voluntary compliance with  the  principles
of co-operative governance. In this respect, I would  particularly  like  to
thank my provincial colleagues and their departments for the work  they  are
doing. Very occasionally, they don't reply to letters. Every  now  and  then
Ministers write to them to get an answer to a query,  but  a  reply  doesn't
come.  So,  the  replies  don't  only  not  come  from  provincial  district
officials, sometimes they don't come from the very top.

We must change that if Batho Pele is not to remain a kind of empty,  sterile
slogan. There is hard work taking place. Changes that are taking  place  are
of a remarkable nature. I  hope,  when  you  intervene,  you  will  take  an
overview of South Africa, because there are 27 000 schools. You  can  always
find a pathology here, a blemish there and a scandal  elsewhere.  There  are
27 000 schools. You and I are the guardians of the improvement. So,  through
our combined efforts, we are making a positive difference in  the  lives  of
South Africans, both in  terms  of  providing  the  skills  needed  for  the
development of our country and also in fighting the scourges of poverty  and
despair and holding out hope which, in our democratic society, is  the  most
important form of celebrating our freedom. Thank you very much.  [Applause.]


Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  MECs,  hon  members  and  special
delegates,  officials  from  the  Department  of  Education,   distinguished
guests, we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the  Ministry
of Education, the Department of  Education  and  the  sponsors  of  Takalani
Sesame, on the award this  educational  television  series  received  in  an
international competition  in  Hamburg  last  month.  As  far  as  we  could
establish, this is the highest media award for this kind  of  programme.  It
is certainly a tribute to our efforts as a  country  to  educate  our  young
people about the benefits of our diverse cultures.

A decade ago, we started the arduous journey to create a  society  based  on
the universal principles of democracy, equality and the restoration  of  the
dignity of the overwhelming majority of our citizens. In doing so, we  have,
as one of our key objectives, committed  ourselves  unconditionally  to  the
fundamental transformation of  our  country's  fragmented  and  diabolically
skewed education system. During these years, we steadfastly  refused  to  be
swayed  by  delusory  objections  from  those  who  want  to  see  privilege
entrenched and not equalised. We have become accustomed to being  castigated
and not complimented. We have falsely been accused of  being  obsessed  with
power and not imbued with it.

Not so long ago, President Thabo Mbeki, in his state of the nation  address,
reminded us of the solid basis  we  have  laid  in  advancing  our  goal  of
creating a better life for all. More importantly and central  to  this,  the
related objectives around eradicating poverty have  been  achieved.  We  are
indeed proud to announce to the nation and those  present  here  today  that
there can be no comparison between what  we  have  achieved  over  the  last
decade and the position prior to the  ANC  coming  to  power  in  1994.  The
resounding endorsement of the electorate in 1999  is  irrefutable  proof  of
our commitment to pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

We have done so with the collective support of teachers,  parents,  learners
and civil society organisations. Our education system, particularly  general
education  and  training,  is  now  better  positioned  to  respond  to  the
developmental, cognitive and behavioural challenges of our learners in  this
band.

True to the character and ethos of the ANC, we will not for one moment  deny
that much more needs to be done to address  the  historic  inequalities,  as
these continue to manifest themselves  in  both  rural  and  urban  schools.
However, we have identified our priorities and  remain  confident  that  our
approach is the correct one. So let us dwell  on  these  priorities  because
the ANC embraces  perspective  and  those  in  the  opposition  benches,  an
adjective.

We are indeed proud to  announce  today  that  after  an  initial  inclement
reception, common sense has prevailed and we have weathered the storms  that
threatened the mergers of our institutions of higher learning. We  have  now
graduated to the implementation phase. What is especially  significant  from
a provincial perspective is the opening  of  two  national  institutions  of
higher learning in the Northern Cape and  Mpumalanga  provinces  next  year.
These are the only  provinces  which  have  historically  been  deprived  of
institutions of  this  kind.  As  the  ANC,  we  appreciate  the  Minister's
commitment to these national projects, especially  in  the  context  of  the
critically important matter of our human resource development strategy.

Furthermore, we are looking forward to the successful implementation of  the
revised national curriculum for Grade 9 from 2004. Whilst the South  African
Constitution  provides  the  basis   for   curriculum   transformation   and
development in South Africa, inequality and poverty are,  as  we  have  said
earlier, still pervasive in our schools. The preamble states  quite  clearly
that it aims to heal the divisions of  the  past  and  establish  a  society
based on democratic values, social justice and fundamental human rights.

It also seeks to improve the quality of life of all citizens  and  free  the
potential of each person. It seeks to lay the foundations for  a  democratic
and open society in which Government is based on the will of the people  and
every citizen is equally protected by the law. In  addition,  the  manifesto
on  values,  education  and  democracy  released  in  2001  identifies  some
fundamental values of the Constitution. These are democracy, social  justice
and equity, nonracism, ubuntu, an open society, responsibility, respect  and
other  strategies  for  familiarising  young   South   Africans   with   the
Constitution.

It is precisely  these  strategies  that  find  expression  in  the  revised
curriculum statement, which includes nurturing a  culture  of  communication
and participation.

The question of role modelling promotes commitment  as  well  as  competence
amongst educators. It also ensures that every South African is able to  read
and write. It infuses the classroom with  a  culture  of  human  rights.  It
seeks to make arts and culture part of the curriculum. It puts history  back
in the curriculum. It enjoins us  to  learn  about  the  rich  diversity  of
cultures, beliefs and world views within which the unity of our  country  is
manifested. It promotes multilingualism  and  equal  access.  It  frees  the
potential of girls as  well  as  boys.  It  also  promotes  ethics  and  the
environment and nurturing the new patriotism.

The challenge of the Revised National  Curriculum  Statement  is  how  these
noble but imperative values would be interwoven across the curriculum.  But,
we must be realistic about what a curriculum can and cannot achieve  because
it would obviously be enacted and interpreted in  diverse  contexts.  As  we
are assembled here, there are already  little  tremors  of  anxiety  amongst
some in  our  educator  corps.  As  a  Government  which  understands  these
anxieties, the ANC-led Government also encountered anxieties of its own  not
so long ago. We wish to make a clarion call on all who work in education  to
put shoulder to the wheel to ensure that we transcend this.

 Other priorities in general education and training include the roll-out  of
the Early Childhood Development programme, as envisaged in  White  Paper  5,
which is currently under way in all nine provinces. As the ECD is  still  in
its infancy, we are confident that  given  our  progressive  experiences  in
terms of funding which is governed by  the  Division  of  Revenue  Act,  the
provision of learner support  material  such  as  training,  monitoring  and
support systems, is on track to meet our targets  in  community-based  sites
as well as in schools. Moreover,  we  will  support  the  expansion  of  the
provision of ECD services to children from birth to three years old.

Furthermore, our obligation extends to the implementation of White  Paper  6
on Special Needs Education. This will include establishing at least 30 full-
service schools during the course of this year. We also wish  to  compliment
the Department of Education on their efforts in developing a  framework  for
teacher education. A three-person ministerial committee has  been  appointed
to oversee this process. Our  commitment  to  improving  the  management  of
governance of schools, which leaves a lot to be desired,  is  given  further
impetus with a campaign by the  department  to  reinforce  active  community
participation in the education of their children and  get  people  to  stand
and vote in the coming school governing body elections.

In conclusion, during its long apartheid-induced absence  the  ANC  remained
the ultimate torchbearer of the ideals  and  aspirations  of  the  oppressed
majority in this country. It is against this solid landscape  brought  about
by social engineering that the budget before us today seeks to  address  and
expand on critical problems in education. At the  same  time,  it  seeks  to
ensure increased access, equity and enhanced effeciency. Therefore,  we  are
calling  on  our  social  partners  to  remain  vigilant  and   ensure   the
consolidation of our gains. The tide has indeed turned.

Mr D A KGANARE: Chairperson, the purpose of this debate is  to  discuss  the
Education Vote so that we can make sure that money allocated to us  is  used
to implement Government policy and to contribute towards  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty. We have to utilize  our  budget  allocations  to  find
solutions that will ultimately create a better life for all South  Africans.


Education plays a vital role in allowing us  to  achieve  these  objectives,
and to create permanent solutions by turning job-seekers  into  job-creators
and making the unemployed, employable. This is  the  core  of  the  holistic
development of our children and poverty alleviation in our province. In  our
province we  are  taking  up  the  cudgels  to  combat  HIV/Aids,  hence  we
established an HIV/Aids workplace unit co-ordinated at provincial level.

Its objectives are to create a safe, open  and  supportive  environment  for
people living with HIV/Aids; support and care  for  employees  infected  and
affected by the pandemic and prevent the further spread of  this  and  other
infectious diseases. We believe that the  realisation  of  these  objectives
will increase productivity, reduce absenteeism  and  prolong  the  lives  of
those infected. In spite of staff constraints and the indifference  of  some
employees, the unit is succeeding in changing mind  sets.  HIV/Aids  is  now
regarded as our problem, not theirs.

The problem of orphans is a reality in  all  schools  that  impacts  on  the
financial capacity of schools as well as on learners at an emotional  level.
In the Free State we have identified approximately 22 000 orphans, and  have
the names and addresses of more than 15 000. As a result we took a  decision
to ensure that all these learners are exempted from paying school  fees.  We
are formalising the process of  assisting  their  schools  and  we  will  be
working closely with the Department of Social Development in this regard.

We are faced with the necessity of sustaining the momentum of  our  improved
Grade 12 results over the last number of years, particularly those  of  2002
when our results were above the national average. Our target  for  the  2003
Grade 12 results is an average pass rate of 75% with 20% exemptions, and  to
be above the national average.

Whilst we are happy that the matric percentage pass rate  has  increased,  I
am worried that some schools, that want to achieve 100% at  all  costs,  are
forcing learners to write Grade 12 subjects on standard grade, reducing  the
quality of the passes. Other schools are gatekeeping, that is  holding  back
learners in Grade 11 to ensure that only guaranteed passes in Grade  12  are
promoted. We are dealing  with  this  particular  situation.  Improving  the
examination results of dysfunctional and failing schools presented  us  with
a really difficult situation. But to assist such schools  we  developed  and
implemented a holistic intervention programme, to ensure the  sustainability
of effective teaching, learning and management  at  schools  that  performed
well and to ensure continuous assistance to  those  that  did  not.  Mentors
were redeployed to such schools.

From April new mentors were assigned to newly  identified  failing  schools.
We are compiling a database of all educators in excess  and  those  who  are
unemployed.  Qualified  educators  strategised  their   usefulness   through
reskilling, which will be aligned to labour demands,  thus  contributing  to
resolving the problem of unemployment.

School governing bodies are functioning at  all  schools  in  the  province.
Elections for new SGBs will take place during this month  and  July.  During
April the department trained electoral officers, and  in  August  the  newly
elected SGBs will  be  trained.  As  the  Department  of  Education  we  are
ultimately involved in all aspects  of  learning  and  not  just  at  school
level. In order to encourage life-long learning, the acquisition  of  skills
and making citizens employable, we have embarked on a  process  of  awarding
bursaries to employees and potential employees.

Potential new employees are selected from the pool of  successful  Grade  12
learners who excelled  despite  their  socioeconomic  conditions.  They  are
offered bursaries in  the  subjects  where  there  are  shortages,  such  as
physical science, mathematics, biology, computer  and  information  science,
information  technology,  physical  education  and  educational  psychology.
There are currently 222 new entrants being supported during  this  financial
year. Employees who should receive bursaries are  prioritised  according  to
the strategic objectives of the department as  reflected  in  the  strategic
plan and the skills gaps identified in  the  teaching  corps.  In  order  to
support the delivery of quality classroom practice  and  the  objectives  of
the strategic plan, the following priorities are to  be  addressed  in  this
financial year, regarding 3 413 departmental employees who have  been  given
bursaries.

In addition, the department is supporting 2 666 employees  in  their  second
or third year of study.  To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the
restructuring process, we have  established  four  Mega  FET  colleges  with
multi-campuses. Chief  executive  officers  of  the  FET  colleges  will  be
appointed during the  next  two  months.  We  have  recruited  learners  for
learnerships and purchased high-tech equipment for the  effective  provision
of learnerships and skills programmes for out-of-school use, ie for  adults,
women, people with disabilities and the  unemployed.  At  all  FET  colleges
teaching  and  learning,  student  support  services,   quality   assurance,
management  information  systems  and   administration   and   finance   are
emphasised. As a response to these needs, the  subdirectorate  FET  colleges
embarked on capacity-building workshops  with  the  assistance  of  Tirisano
fellows who participated in the  international  exchange  programme  in  the
United Kingdom for three months.
The link between further education and training and  other  basic  education
and training  provision  is  essential.  To  generate  skills  and  literate
citizens, FET and Abet centres are going to form a  vigorous  parnership  by
offering learnerships in SMMEs and  agriculture  to  alleviate  poverty  and
curb unemployment.  The  core  focus  for  FET  colleges  and  Abet  is  the
realisation of this  aspiration  in  the  near  future.  The  roles  of  FET
colleges and Abet centres are crucial  in  providing  education  and  proper
skilling opportunities for our people, so that they  can  become  employable
and thus regain their human dignity.  Our  department  is  tasked  with  the
responsibility of preparing and nurturing the future South Africa.

 A future South Africa that can compete in a global world;  a  South  Africa
that will be an intrinsic part  of  the  digital  society  -  by  adequately
preparing our learners for the challenges of the 21st century.

The fact that most of our province is rural  presents  real  challenges  for
the ongoing implementation of our information, communication and  technology
plan. Our strategies therefore need to take us beyond the mere provision  of
computers for administration.  We  are  going  to  incorporate  the  highest
levels  of  ICT  technologies  to  deliver  education,  and  especially   E-
education, to our  province.  We  are  currently  engaged  in  a  number  of
partnerships with the corporate sector. Key amongst  them  is  Telkom  in  a
joint initiative with Thintana, expanding the concept of super centres.  The
department has now taken over these centres. A number of organisations  have
individually and collectively contributed basic technological  equipment  to
our institutions. But the total figure for schools with access  to  computer
centres for curriculum delivery is still only 8,6% of all our schools.

This demonstrates that we still have a long  way  to  go  to  eliminate  the
digital divide. The roll-out of computers to schools started in the  2001-02
financial year and is proceeding. In terms of the  norms  and  standards  of
public funding for schools,  the  Department  of  Education  is  obliged  to
subsidise learners who take longer than an hour and a half to  walk  to  the
nearest  school.  According  to  our  investigation,  the  longest   walking
distance is 23km  for  a  single  trip  to  school.  A  committee  has  been
established to investigate that matter  and  formulate  a  proposal.  It  is
planned that this proposal will be put into operation during  the  financial
year of 2004-05 and be implemented in phases. The first phase  will  include
those learners who walk the greatest distance.

In line with our approach  to  handling  this  particular  matter,  we  have
developed a farm school rationalisation strategy whereby learners from  farm
schools who travel long distances are put in hostels  where  the  department
has to pay for  them.  We  already  have  three  hostels  operating  in  our
province and  two  will  be  introduced  during  this  financial  year.  Our
nutrition programme run in collaboration  with  the  Departments  of  Social
Development,  Agriculture  and  Health,  demonstrates  the  social  security
network. At the moment the nutrition programme is run by the  Department  of
Health. But the attitude that it should affect all learners in a  particular
grade is wrong because there are certain schools which have parents who  are
doing better than others. And we have decided to identify schools which  are
really poor so that we can be able  to  extend  this  particular  need  from
Grade 1 to Grade 9.

In 1994 there was a backlog of  165  school  buildings  in  the  Free  State
province. And as I am talking to you now, we only have 67. It is a  standing
principle to prioritise the building of schools where the need is  greatest.
Informal  settlements,  for  example,  are  some  of  the  pressure  points.
However, as learner numbers in our province continue to dwindle, we have  to
reprioritise school building sites. Decisions are  informed  by  demographic
patterns and statistics that show where learner numbers  are  declining  and
empty classrooms subsequently increasing. So, too, platooning  schools  that
are individually nonviable are merged.

A 2002 survey conducted by the Free  State  Department  of  Education  shows
that almost  2  000  empty  classrooms  did  not  justify  building  schools
according  to  our  original  three-year  plan.  To  provide  infrastructure
effectively,  we  will  put  in  place  a  more  integrated  infrastructural
development plan, which will be reviewed annually.

Mr C N M PADAYACHEE (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  delegates,
ladies  and  gentlemen,  comrades,  I  thank  you  for  affording   me   the
opportunity to speak on this Education Vote of our country.  The  Mpumalanga
Department of Education is a department that continuously and  progressively
strives towards  bringing  quality  education  to  all  our  people  in  the
province. We commit ourselves to the conviction  that  it  is  only  through
education that our minds will  be  liberated,  proper  values  instilled  in
society and our people skilled. This is the unavoidable  route  towards  the
creation of a nation that is  patriotic  and  committed.  It  is  the  right
direction towards the realisation of a better life for all.

 In Mpumalanga all our strategies and energies are directed  towards  making
all our  schools  run  effectively  and  efficiently  and  I  want  to  just
highlight a few issues  as  outlined  by  the  Minister,  particularly  with
regard to the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review for 2002-03.

But before I do that, in  2002  I  instituted  an  assessment  committee  to
investigate reasons for the poor matric results in  our  province  in  2001.
This committee made recommendations on why  the  results  deteriorated.  The
department did not hesitate to implement the  recommendations  and  today  I
attribute  the  9%  improvement  in  the  2002  Grade  12  results  to  this
initiative as well as a number of intervention programmes undertaken by  the
department.  Constant  support  visits  by  circuit   managers,   curriculum
implementors,  regional  teams,  national  teams  and  even  the  provincial
executive council to schools is an endeavour to ensure school  effectiveness
and an improvement in results, not only at Grade 12, but  from  Grade  R  to
Grade 12. Endless capacity-building programmes to empower  all  role-players
are the order of the day in the province.

The delivery of learner support material before the end of each school  year
has enhanced our school effectiveness programme. Last year  in  the  2002-03
budget, we spent R112 million on learner support material. This year it  has
increased to R241 million. Last week Friday I visited  the  learner  support
warehouse where all the textbooks and the stationery are kept  to  verify  a
report from my HOD that textbooks and stationery for the  beginning  of  the
2004 school year have already been ordered,  received  from  publishers  and
distributed  to  schools.  Indeed  this  was  the  case.  Schools   in   the
KwaMhlanga,  Moretele,  and  Witbank  areas  have  already  received   their
stationery for next year and as I speak now delivery is taking place.

Also worth mentioning  is  that  our  expenditure  per  learner  on  learner
support material has increased drastically over the past  three  years  from
R54 per learner in the year 2000 to R235 in the  year  2002  and  R267  this
year. This represents an increase of more than  393%  over  the  past  three
years. And indeed, as the review shows, it  is  the  highest  spent  in  the
country. Over the past three years the province has spent more than  half  a
billion rand on learner support material. However, much still  needs  to  be
done on the retrieval of textbooks in our  schools  and  to  alleviate  this
problem we have introduced a system in the last month to help schools  begin
to retrieve these textbooks.

As in many other provinces, many of our children on farms have to walk  more
than 4 km to the nearest schools, a problem we  dealt  with  by  introducing
scholar transport in 1997 whereby we transported 3 200 learners  at  a  cost
of more than R3 million. Over the years this has increased drastically  with
4 400 learners being transported at a cost of R8,8 million  in  2000  to  23
981 learners at a cost of more than R40 million this year.  This  represents
an increase of more than 307% over the past three years.

In 2002 R3,7 million was budgeted for early childhood development.  Today  I
am proud to indicate to this House that R31,6 million has been budgeted  for
ECD this year. This represents an increase of more than  R27,9  million.  To
make sure that this programme is expanded, a total of 715  sites  have  been
catered for in this year's budget, compared to 250 sites provided  for  last
year. And therefore, as Minister Asmal has said, we are on  target  so  that
by the year 2010 ECD will  be  part  of  the  10-year  compulsory  education
system. Children would come to Grade 1 more prepared and this  would  reduce
the repetition rate throughout our whole schooling system.

The inclusive education pilot programme  is  going  on  well  in  the  pilot
schools. It is pleasing to note that all pilot schools  have  been  provided
with computers and to date 280 classroom-based educators and  55  curriculum
implementors and circuit managers have been trained in inclusive  education.
In our endeavour to introduce ICT and e-education to all our schools in  the
province, we have budgeted R13,7 million to purchase at least  one  computer
for every school with electricity. Our commitment is clear that by  the  end
of this year every school that has electricity  will  have  computers.  Last
year 500 schools which did not have any computers were supplied with one.

 As our hon premier said in his  provincial  address  on  21  February  this
year, the Department of Education has managed to exceed its  own  target  in
the  schools  infrastructure   development   programme   by   building   428
classrooms, 28 special rooms, 29 administration blocks and 208 toilets,  and
15 schools were renovated from our  equitable  share  to  the  tune  of  R61
million in the past financial year. Furthermore, 36 schools were  furnished,
an additional 362 toilets were built,  82  schools  were  renovated  and  14
water connections were made from the conditional grants  of  R47,5  million.
Lastly, an additional 51 schools were also renovated from  the  flood-damage
funds at a cost of R15 million. In this financial year we  have  planned  to
build 685 classrooms, 16 special rooms, 14  administration  blocks  and  982
toilets worth R113,25 million from the  equitable  share.  The  building  of
these have already begun.

From the conditional grants that we received - an amount of  R71  million  -
we will renovate 88 schools, build a further 638 toilets, fence 57  schools,
connect electricity to 83 schools and supply water to  96  schools.  From  a
Japanese  donation  funding,  we  will  be  building   an   additional   232
classrooms, 20 administration blocks, 4 special rooms, and 248 toilets,  and
for this funding we must thank the Minister of Education  for  assisting  us
in this regard. The department  has  also  set  aside  an  amount  of  R11,2
million  within  the  infrastructure  development   allocation   for   youth
contractors. This is a huge empowerment initiative which is not a  once-off.
The department will strive to have such job  creation  initiatives  also  in
the coming year.

The Mpumalanga regional  training  task  team  will  indeed  help  to  build
capacity  and  assist  these  emerging  contractors  in  providing   quality
workmanship. From the above, one will deduce that  over  the  past  year  we
have doubled our efforts to reduce the classroom backlog, from building  428
classrooms in the year 2000 to building  917  classrooms  this  year.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Hon Minister  and  hon  members,  information  is  power,  it
brings knowledge to life. It is empowerment as it awakens the alignment  for
success. Information is education, which is an essential  component  of  the
reconstruction, development and transformation of South African society.  If
the nation is educated, it gives them access to quality of  life,  to  which
the ANC-led Government is committed.

The late comrade Harry Gwala once  said,  ``Education  is  a  right,  not  a
privilege.'' In the past, we  were  deprived  of  this.  Among  the  various
factors that determined one's level of education, race was  most  prominent.
As a result of this discrimination, blacks have been based in  predominantly
low-paid, menial work in comparison to whites, most of whom  are  well  paid
and in respectable positions.

According to Census 1996,  figures  released  by  Statistics  South  Africa,
there are 23,6 million adults between  the  ages  of  16  and  65  in  South
Africa. Of those, 3,2 million  have  not  accessed  any  schooling  and  9,4
million have not completed Grade 9. Thus, 54% of the total adult  population
have not completed a general  level  of  education.  Government  is  setting
responsibilities to quality. The  Minister  of  Education  once  said,  ``No
adult South African should be illiterate in the 21st  century  but  millions
will be, unless we mobilise a social movement to bring reading, writing  and
numeracy to those who do not have it.''

Section 29 of the Bill of Rights includes the right of  all  citizens  to  a
basic education, including adult  basic  education  and  further  education,
which  the  state  through  reasonable  measures  must   make   progessively
available  and  accessible.  Abet  introduces  a  culture  of  learning  and
provides a foundation for acquiring the knowledge and  skills  required  for
social and economic development, justice and equality.  It  should  link  to
development  programmes,  employment  creation   initiatives   and   further
education and training opportunities, and allow for career pathing.

Indeed, these are challenging times. Blacks have the democracy  they  fought
for and it is  our  chance  to  prove  ourselves  within  the  process  from
liberation to transformation. There is growth in the Abet sector.  In  1995-
2000 the total number of adult educators grew  to  16  089.  The  number  of
learners also grew to 294 566. A total of 2 226 adult learning centres  have
been established. It should also be acknowledged that  the  growth  occurred
within budgetary constraints. The figures above  grew  rapidly  every  year.
Government, through private-public partnerships created  a  useful  capacity
that was transferred to learners. With regard  to  educators,  for  example,
out of 3 000 participants targeted, 2 028 were trained. Learners  should  be
allowed to cope at their own pace.  The  educational  programmes  should  be
designed to protect and advance basic human rights irrespective  of  gender,
race, class, creed or age.

 These will greatly deal with encouraging quality of life.  Basic  education
for youth and adults is  a  prerequisite  for  a  truly  democratic  society
because it prepares people for full and  active  participation  in  society.
After the President's call during his state of the nation address  in  2002,
the  Minister  together  with  his  department   instructed   provinces   to
prioritise critical situations where children are learning under  trees,  in
the open air or under any unacceptible conditions.

Business plans were requested from provinces  with  specific  timeframes  to
eliminate these situations. We are now in  a  position  to  justifiably  say
that in view of these business plans provinces were and are in fact  working
on these infrastructural backlogs.

In the last financial year 3 750 classrooms were either  under  construction
or completed by provincial departments of education in genuine  attempts  to
ensure that provinces eliminate these situations in  the  shortest  possible
time. The department has made remarkable progress  with  the  implementation
of the Japanese Grant Aid for school construction.  The  Japanese  programme
entails the building of school infrastructure to the value of R200  million,
which has been divided equally among  four  provinces,  namely  the  Eastern
Cape, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo.

We still lack basic human rights. Water  and  sanitation  are  necessary  to
create a healthy environment for  learners.  They  are  central  to  healthy
physical and mental development. We  are  therefore  heartened  by  the  hon
Minister's announcement on the progress. The hon Minister also made  mention
of the  budget  and  the  implementation  of  electricity  and  improved  IT
systems. This is quite impressive and should be implemented in  rural  areas
to stop over-rapid urbanisation, which has  resulted  in  the  migration  of
many from rural to urban areas.

IT in our schools will open a huge arena of ideas  and  information  to  our
learners and education in rural areas. It will play an  important  role.  We
still have a challenge that we need to address -  transportation  to  school
and accessibility of our schools for our disabled people.  The  question  of
incentives for Abet educators should also be  addressed.  There  is  also  a
need to develop recruiting programmes  to  ensure  that  girls  are  in  the
mainstream education at schools. There is  quite  a  number  who  are  still
playing mothers at home whilst parents are not staying with  their  families
and working far from their home.

In conclusion, I would like to congratulate the Minister on the Budget  Vote
and progress of the department and fully support it. I would  also  like  to
echo what was said once in this House, namely that if you  ``empower  women,
you empower the nation; empower the youth  and  you  empower  the  future.''
Halala ANC! I thank God for this Government, God bless us all. Thank you.

Ms G N SWARTBOOI (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you, Madam Chair. I wish to  commend
the hon Minister of Education, Prof  Kader  Asmal,  for  the  policy  budget
speech he has just presented to us. It is a  real  public  policy  expressed
...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  member,  can  you  just  hold  on.  Rev
Chabaku?

Rev M CHABAKU: With apologies, I had raised my hand before the  hon  speaker
stood up.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: My apologies. I did not see your hand.

Rev M CHABAKU: I just want  to  alert  this  House,  with  your  permission,
Chairperson, that this was a maiden speech from the Free State.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  Chabaku,  you  are  misinformed,  most
unfortunately. This is the second speech. Over to you, Ms Swartbooi.

Ms G N SWARTBOOI: I hope that I will  still  have  my  five  minutes,  Madam
Chair. It is a real public policy expressed and deals with amounts of  money
for goals and specific objectives, which the Department of Education  is  to
achieve by means of relevant expenditure.  Without  wasting  time,  we  hope
there will be no underexpenditure. Time is a key resource.

I just want to be direct and kick off by addressing  the  following  issues,
namely Abet as well as the transformation of higher education.  As  part  of
Government's commitment to addressing the legacy  of  the  past,  where  the
majority of the people were deprived of access to education  and  to  higher
education, we can see that the  Ministry  of  Education  has  expressed  its
commitment  by  increasing  the  budget  expenditure  on  Abet  and   higher
education. This should be appreciated. Education is a key resource.

 During 1999 provincial education departments  reached  over  389  000  Abet
learners whereas the target set in the  multiyear  implementation  plan  was
177 000. This year, 2003, the enrolment of Abet  learners,  I  presume,  has
increased to 389 000 multiplied by four. In KZN, to be  specific,  Abet  was
previously just a subprogramme  but  now  it  has  developed  into  a  fully
fledged programme. Furthermore, expenditure in this programme has  increased
from R19 million in the 2000-01 financial year to R46 million  for  2003-04.
The only challenge that we are faced with in our province is the  monitoring
and evaluation strategy for Abet provisioning and performance, because I  do
not think our province  has  the  mechanism  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the
effectiveness and efficiency of Abet centres.

We  need  to  check  whether  these  projects  still  address  the  original
objectives or the problems they were meant to solve. There should  be  value
for money, which is the key resource.

On higher education, as KZN  we  are  happy  with  the  transformation.  The
national plan for higher education was to increase  the  participation  rate
from 15% to 20% in the long term - for example 10-15 years - to develop  the
employment equity plan with clear targets for  rectifying  race  and  gender
inequities  and  change  all  institutions  to  make  them   nonracial   and
nonsexist, as well as to develop strategies to build capacity.

What I want to raise with the Minister is that learners,  whilst  at  school
level, need to be informed of  the  earmarked  funds  for  scholarships  and
bursaries. Each institution  should  be  in  a  position  to  create  public
awareness of the financial aid and support  services.  Higher  education  is
becoming expensive.  This  was  also  raised  at  the  ANC's  51st  National
Conference in Stellenbosch.

In conclusion, the Minister has touched  on  the  new  funding  formula  for
FETs.  We  hope  that  colleges  like  Madadeni,  Esikhaweni  and  Gamalakhe
colleges will be converted into FET centres because now,  with  the  merging
of technikons and colleges, we have a lot of white elephant buildings  which
are unused. This is a waste of resources.

We also hope that the department will speed  up  the  issues  around  giving
incentives and perks to the educators, especially those  who  are  committed
to go to the rural areas for the betterment of the  rural  communities,  and
retain qualified  teachers  in  our  country  because  we  are  losing  good
teachers to the  already  developed  countries.  I  support  the  view  that
teachers should be graded according to their educational  qualifications.  I
thank you.

Mr A C MSANE (Gauteng): Hon  Chairperson,  members  of  the  NCOP,  Minister
Asmal, it gives me great pleasure to respond  to  the  education  speech  as
presented by Comrade Kader.

It is indeed gratifying to note that the quality of education in  the  whole
country has improved beyond expectations. It is further gratifying  to  note
that this improvement is taking place amongst the poorest  of  the  poor  of
our communities. It is further encouraging to notice that the  girl  learner
is making huge strides in closing the gap that  existed  prior  to  1994  in
terms of previously male-domidated professions. More and more girls are  now
entering the fields of engineering, medicine,  computer  science,  actuarial
science, commerce, etc.

This can only augur well for the sustainable development of our people,  our
region and our continent. The sooner we remove the many stereotypes  of  our
people that are out there, the sooner we will remove societies from  extreme
levels of poverty and in doing so we will be consciously  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

I would like to therefore agree with the Minister that the  vehicle  through
which we will realise the rapid enhancement of  our  people,  is  education.
Through education we will  also  individually  remove  people  from  poverty
cycles. As a collective we will be able to remove societies and  the  nation
at large from these poverty cycles.  It  is  therefore  imperative  that  we
ensure that in each province the largest chunk of the provincial  budget  is
spent on education. It is also important and crucial for us  as  legislators
to support the  Ministry  in  its  quest  to  ensure  that  we  educate  for
development.

 In terms of the National Norms and Standards for School Funding,  the  bulk
of the money expended goes to the  poorest  schools  in  the  country.  This
needs to be encouraged further so as to ensure that we  break  the  backbone
of poverty.

With regard to the curriculum, it is indeed encouraging  to  know  that  all
learners in South Africa, whether they are in public, independent  or  rural
schools, follow the same curriculum. A  common  curriculum  pursued  by  all
learners means that we are moving closer to realising  a  national  identity
and character.

The Grade 12 results are continuously  on  the  rise,  which  is  incredible
because it demonstrates that the education  system  has  indeed  turned  the
tide. As a nation that is hungry for qualitative education  we  cannot  rest
on our laurels, but need to set higher  standards  to  further  improve  the
results. We need to also ensure that more learners  do  subjects  on  higher
grade, like maths, science, accountancy, economics and business economics.

Without a dedicated teacher corps all  the  advances  towards  a  successful
education system would not have been possible. We need  to  acknowledge  all
our hardworking and dedicated educators and I salute them all.

Principals and School Management Teams, or  SMTs,  are  playing  significant
roles in ensuring that we have a competent and effective  education  system.
We need to encourage the further development of our  SMTs.  I  believe  that
Gauteng will be launching a school of leadership and  governance  very  soon
to ensure that principals, aspirant principals and SGBs  receive  additional
training. This is good for education development.

The additional remuneration of educators in certain public schools needs  to
be dealt with as a matter of extreme urgency. Educators employed  under  the
Employment of Educators Act cannot receive additional remuneration. If  they
do remunerated work outside of the Public Service  they  need  to  seek  the
permission of the relevant head of department.  It  is  quite  obvious  that
this is a contentious issue, because not all of us  in  this  country  would
like to see the gaps narrowing between the rich and the  poor.  We  need  to
provide our unequivocal support to the Ministry to deal with this.

The review on the functioning and effectiveness of school  governing  bodies
and the study on the  cost  of  education  are  two  fundamental  pieces  of
research and investigation that are needed to ensure that  communities  take
ownership of schools. The cost of education investigations will  assist  the
Ministry to further ensure that the most vulnerable people  in  society  are
protected. We have to support the Ministry in these developments.

The issue of HIV/Aids is one of the most crucial aspects  that  we  need  to
concentrate on. I would argue that it will be very  difficult  to  eradicate
poverty if we do  not  deal  sensibly  with  HIV/Aids  issues.  We  need  to
strengthen the solid foundation  that  has  been  laid  in  our  schools  in
dealing with this epidemic. Each one of us should  volunteer  our  time  and
services to ensure that we play our role in the development of our  country.
There are millions of children that go to school on a  daily  basis  without
having had  anything  to  eat.  The  school  nutrition  programme  needs  to
continue if we really want to produce the scientists of tomorrow.

In conclusion, Chairperson, I would like to call on each one of  us  present
here today to congratulate the efforts of thousands of educators,  learners,
parents and officials in ensuring that  this  country  produces  qualitative
education for the nation. I would also like to challenge each one of  us  to
support the endeavours of the Ministry and begin to ask the question,  "What
can I do for my country?" instead of, "What can the country do  for  me?"  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, education  lies  at  the
heart of everything we wish to  achieve  as  a  nation.  Education  plays  a
crucial role in determining our progress through life and lies at the  heart
of our hopes and dreams for our children, families and communities.

Our country's Constitution commits us to improve the quality of life of  all
our citizens and free the potential of each person and  to  build  a  united
and democratic South Africa able to take its rightful place as  a  sovereign
state in the family of nations.

 The New NP believes that education is a means of  self-fulfilment  and  the
development of people's full potential; the  means  for  South  Africans  to
contribute to progress and prosperity for the country and all its people;  a
key to addressing our unemployment and a critical  success  factor  to  make
our country more globally competitive.

The constitutional  prohibition  on  any  form  of  discrimination  must  be
strictly adhered to. All learners must have  equal  opportunities.  Equality
means that every pupil should have the chance to receive  an  education  and
training suited to his or her interests and talents whatever  the  financial
position of the parents. Although  the  state  will  have  to  shoulder  its
responsibility with respect  to  disadvantaged  learners,  parents  will  be
required to contribute according to their means.

Quality education in the classroom is non-negotiable.  It  is  important  to
instill and maintain core values at school level. The aim  of  education  is
not merely to distribute facts. Teachers are, however, not the  only  people
to instill values such as integrity, diligence,  excellence,  responsibility
and honesty. Schools need to make parents aware of their  responsibility  to
become positive role models for their children.
Good  governance  in  education  is  non-negotiable  and  must  ensure   the
involvement of  the  community  and  parents.  Respect  and  support  school
governing  bodies.  Respect  the  professional  status   of   teachers   and
lecturers. Resolve matters through consultation  and  not  unilaterally.  Be
accountable, efficient and cost-effective. Observe  standards  and  deliver.
Promoting partnership between the state and the private  sector  is  of  the
utmost importance. Parental involvement in education is crucial.

Partnership with the private  sector  also  implies  that  there  should  be
incentives for the schools that deliver excellent results. And the focus  on
restoring discipline in our schools needs to be  implemented  by  developing
intervention  programmes  and  encouraging  the  clustering  of  schools  to
involve the community and businesses in fighting violence, abuse  and  crime
at school level. Discipline must be restored in schools by  means  of  clear
codes of conduct, disciplinary procedures and sanctions.

Ek is baie bly dat  minister  Asmal  tydens  sy  begrotingsposdebat  in  die
Nasionale Vergadering ook aandag aan die situasie van  ons  kinders  in  die
sogenaamde plaasskole, of soos  hulle  dit  deesdae  noem,  multigraadskole,
geskenk het.

Soos seker ook in ander dele van die land, is 'n groot persentasie  van  die
kinders in hierdie skole  werklik  die  voorheen  benadeeldes,  die  huidige
benadeeldes en - as ons  nie  iets  daadwerkliks  daaraan  doen  nie  -  die
toekomstige benadeeldes. Die kinders van die plaasskole is in  baie  gevalle
die armstes  van  die  armes  met  verdere  sosio-ekonomiese  nood  wat  met
drankmisbruik gepaardgaan.

Hoeveel van hulle het hoop op 'n beter toekoms en wat doen die  onderwys  om
hulle op te voed om ook hulle drome  te  verwesenlik?  Sal  hulle  ook  maar
plaaswerkers wees soos hulle ouers en dié se ouers? Of kan  ons  hulle  help
om deur te breek na 'n beter toekoms om dan ten  minste  te  mik  daarna  om
eendag 'n plaasbestuurder  of  selfs  'n  plaaseienaar  te  wees?  Ons  moet
dringend werk daarvan maak om hulle 'n alternatief te bied vir  die  huidige
akademiese opvoeding sodat dié wat belangstel eerder spesifiek  opgelei  kan
word in 'n werkrigting.

Op die oomblik is 'n groot getal plaaskinders wat graad 7  bereik  eenvoudig
te bang om op die dorp  se  skool  verder  te  gaan  leer  en  hulleself  te
bekwaam. Gewoonlik is daar  ook  nie  geld  daarvoor  nie  en  so  gaan  die
sirkelbeweging van geslag tot geslag maar voort. Dit is die ou  storie:  "Ek
is arm, want my pa kon nie bekostig om my te laat leer nie, want hy het  nie
geleerdheid gehad nie en daarom sal my kinders arm wees."

Kom ons gryp in en help  hierdie  kinders  om  hul  werklike  potensiaal  te
bereik sodat hulle 'n groter bydrae kan maak tot ons land  se  voordeel.  Ek
dank u. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[I am very pleased that Minister Asmal also paid attention to the  situation
of our children in the so-called farm schools, or as they are  known  today,
multigrade schools, during his Budget Vote debate in the National Assembly.
As perhaps also in other parts of the country, a  large  percentage  of  the
children in these  schools  are  truly  the  previously  disadvantaged,  the
presently disadvantaged and - if we do not actually do something about  this
- the future disadvantaged. The children of the farm  schools  are  in  many
instances the poorest of the poor with  further  socioeconomic  difficulties
associated with alcohol abuse.

How many of them have hope for a better future and what is  education  doing
to educate them so that they can realise their dreams?  Or  will  they  also
become farmworkers like their parents, and their parents  before  them?  Or,
can we assist them in breaking through to a better future to  at  least  aim
at one day becoming a farm manager or even a farm owner?  We  must  urgently
make an effort to provide an alternative to the current  academic  education
so that those who are interested can rather be  specifically  trained  in  a
new direction.

At the moment a large number of  farm  children  who  achieve  Grade  7  are
simply too scared to attend the town school for  further  education  and  to
qualify themselves. Usually there is no money for  this  and  so  the  cycle
continues from generation to generation. This  is  the  old  story:  ``I  am
poor, because my father could not afford to let me study because he did  not
have the education, and therefore my children will be poor.''

Let us intervene and help these children to achieve their real potential  in
order for them to  make  a  greater  contribution  to  the  benefit  of  our
country. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr I W  J  STADHOUER  (Northern  Cape):  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson.  Hon
Minister of Education, Prof Asmal, hon MECs and special  delegates  and  hon
members, allow me to apologise for our MEC, Ms  Tina  Joemat-Pettersson  who
unfortunately could not join us and for whom I stand in  today.  I  wish  to
add that it  is  indeed  a  privilege  to  be  accorded  an  opportunity  to
participate in the debate on behalf of our province.

In the Northern Cape province we have made remarkable progress with  respect
to education. This signals the kind of holistic progress that we  have  made
in our country as a whole and our policies and actions continually  dovetail
with one another as we advance in addressing the actual  interests  and  the
needs of our people. We are doing everything to extend best-practice  models
in our system so that they dominate the overall outlook of  our  work.  This
also serves as a means to an  end,  namely  to  provide  permanent  economic
reprive from poverty  to  the  masses  of  our  people  and  furthermore  to
eliminate the social ills that work against the swelling tide of  unity  and
nation-building.

As we concur with our hon President, Mr  Thabo  Mbeki,  that  the  tide  has
turned, we also acknowledge that racism still stands out like a  sore  thumb
in our schools. Racism and discrimination affect the very  fabric  on  which
is premised the cornerstones of our democratic order.  Hence,  we  have  the
consistent effort on the part of Government in our schools to promote  human
rights and justice. We have thrown down the gauntlet to those  schools  that
persist in pursuing  racial  paranoia  and  exclusivity;  schools  that  are
totally failing to promote parity with regard to the  learner  and  educator
composition and the ratios. This constitutes one of the  ongoing  challenges
of transformation in South Africa.

Work still needs to be done to ensure that the citizens and learners of  our
country are knowledgeable and aware of the  question  of  national  symbols,
including the  constitutional  values  that  underpin  our  existence  as  a
country and sovereign state. We must work to affirm our  common  citizenship
and identity without equivocation, especially among  the  youth.  Hence  the
need to critically look at the question of the  celebration  of  our  public
holidays. In the Northern Cape, the Freedom Day celebrations  were  held  in
all our schools throughout the province. School-based activities were  based
on the theme: What freedom means for me and  for  my  community.  There  has
also been sufficient ground laid for the necessary work to  be  carried  out
amongst our youth through the retaining and  capacitating  of  our  teachers
and educators.

Initiatives are being implemented for the consolidation of human  rights  in
the curriculum. This particularly pertains to the AECE on values  and  human
rights programmes. We are aware of the fact that education  cannot  continue
to play a minimal role as it relates to the development of  our  people  and
the democratic ethos of our country. Hence, our province initiated  the  IEC
Schools Voter Education  Project.  This  year's  pilot  project  started  in
September last year and there are 25 schools involved. Our schools are  also
involved in the electoral democracy development programme.

We are working  to  ensure  maximum  efficiency  in  the  redistribution  of
resources to benefit especially the neediest of our  society.  There  is  no
need to further clarify the urgency  with  which  Government  must  work  to
extend the frontiers of  prosperity  and  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. Hence, the Northern Cape  has  made  rapid  progress  in  terms  of
increasing the non-personnel allocation from  R57  million  in  the  2002-03
financial  year  to  R62,44  million  currently.  The  average   per-learner
allocation of R320 is the highest in the country.

Already this year the Ministry of Education and  the  department  have  been
able to provide all secondary schools with  at  least  10  computers  and  a
laser printer. The spin-offs of this are that all  these  schools  now  have
electricity  and  heightened  security,  contributing  to  a  safer   school
environment.

The greater proportion of our budget goes to  public  ordinary  schools  and
improving the learning and lives of our learners.  Since  the  beginning  of
this year we have implemented a  vigorous  school  food  security  programme
which is mainly the extension of the primary school feeding  scheme  to  our
communities, ECD sites  and  secondary  schools,  especially  for  our  poor
learners. Simultaneously we have worked hard to ensure that  schools  adhere
to the policy of exempting those parents who are poor and cannot  afford  to
pay school fees. Our Premier and our MEC have been  particularly  passionate
about opening the doors of learning to children in rural areas and  also  at
our farm schools. The 20% of the poorest learners in  our  province  receive
approximately 35% of all  the  allocations.  The  Department  of  Education,
taking the lead from our Government, is serious  about  the  elimination  of
poverty and directing resources to the most needy. Hence,  schools  in  less
poor quartiles are also being specifically targeted.

We are also hard at work towards the  renewal  of  mandates  of  AGBs.  This
process is  currently  being  underpinned  by  a  process  of  advocacy  and
mobilisation. We have almost completed the process to merge  schools  as  we
now  are  at  the  stage  where  we  are  looking   at   the   question   of
representivity. It is not without difficulty that we  have  been  traversing
into courts daily,  seeking  to  enforce  the  purpose  and  spirit  of  our
Constitution.

Generally the assessment of our whole school  evaluation  process  indicates
that there is marked improvement in the management of schools and  therefore
the quality of education is signalled  by  our  Grade  12  results.  We  are
currently hard at work in our  provincial  department  also.  Amongst  other
things, we seek to instill behavioural change amongst all of our people  and
therefore minimise, if  not  eliminate  the  spread  of  HIV/Aids.  In  this
process we have made a concerted effort to build capacity  to  realise  this
objective. Furthermore, all our schools have  an  HIV/Aids  policy.  We  are
currently also at a very advanced stage in the  implementation  of  HIV/Aids
and life-skills programmes in our FET colleges. Of course this  is  critical
as we work to at least eliminate the rampant risk  factors  associated  with
youth  in  respect  of  HIV/Aids.  Consistent  with  this  response  of  our
Government at the national level to the challenge of HIV/Aids, the  Northern
Cape government programme in schools is a holistic  strategy  to  deal  with
HIV/Aids with an approach that also deliberately seeks to target even  those
youth that are out of school and therefore very vulnerable.

Amongst the notable areas in which we are making  great  progress  is  adult
education. Clearly the issues of lifelong learning and  the  eradication  of
skills poverty are critical. This year, in terms of Abet  our  target  is  9
900 learners and the budget has  been  significantly  increased  from  R9,24
million to R27 million for this year. The most challenging task is  to  reel
back in those learners or potential learners who  are  in  fact  the  actual
victims of apartheid  denial.  Abet  services  for  older  generations,  and
especially women, are therefore critical in terms of  skills  transfer.  The
FET colleges in the  Northern  Cape  are  at  the  axis  of  addressing  the
existing skills imbalances that necessitate a holistic focus  on  Abet.  The
rapid progress that has been made is reflected in terms of  the  19  centres
of Abet ... [Time expired.] I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

 Mr M A MZIZI (KwaZulu-Natal): Sihlalo,  ngivumele  ngibonge  ukucosha  leli
thuba lokuthi ngiphawule nami kwiSabiwomali sezemFundo  futhi  ngihalalisele
uNgqongqoshe. [Chairperson,  let  me  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to
comment on the Education budget and to congratulate the Minister.]

Madam Chairperson, education is one of the most important factors to  ensure
a country's long-term social and  economic  survival.  The  education  of  a
nation's children determines the resources that a  nation  can  successfully
apply towards economic growth, a skilled labour  force  and  improvement  of
life for all its people. It is therefore vital  that  the  education  budget
must reflect a nation's commitment to  its  own  future.  South  Africa  has
since 1994 allocated vast sums of money to education.  As  a  percentage  of
the entire Budget, our education spending is on a par  with  most  developed
countries in the world. In many cases it is higher.

But we have to ask the question whether we are getting value for our  money.
Yes, there has been a steady improvement in matric pass rates over the  last
few years. But that cannot be the only  criterion.  Are  we  getting  enough
well-qualified learners into the  tertiary  sector?  Are  we  equipping  our
learners with the required skills base to obtain  employment  after  school?
And are we creating and maintaining an environment in  which  our  educators
remain in state employment and are committed to teaching our children?

These are the questions that  come  under  the  spotlight  in  an  education
policy debate. Almost on a daily basis we hear stories of educators  leaving
the public education sector, either for overseas or for private schools.  We
hear stories of teachers abusing  their  position  and  their  learners,  of
teachers arriving drunk at school, or often not  arriving  at  all,  and  of
learners  threatening  and  even  abusing   teachers,   sometimes   carrying
dangerous weapons onto school property, including firearms.

These stories paint a picture of a department in crisis.  Add  to  that  the
recent controversies surrounding religious instruction  in  schools,  target
shooting and removing extra remuneration for extramural duties of  teachers,
and we have to seriously ask the question: Is education in South  Africa  in
a crisis? And furthermore, is the Minister in control of  the  policies,  or
are they being hijacked by vested interests?

The Minister  owes  this  House  honest  answers  to  these  very  important
questions.  If  the  answer  to  any  of  the  above  even  comes  close  to
representing a crisis, we need to know. And we need to be assured  that  the
Minister and the department will act  speedily  and  decisively  to  address
whatever problems are being experienced in the education sector. It is  only
in this way that we can be reassured that South Africa is  investing  enough
in its own future. [Interjections.]

Ngimbonile, mfowethu. Ungakhathazeki. [I have  seen  him,  brother.  Do  not
worry.]

[Chairperson, let me comment on Mr Kganare's  speech,  in  which  he  talked
about funds for  schoolchildren  who  attend  schools  far  from  home.  Hon
member, when you go to the Free State, there  is  a  certain  place  on  the
Villiers and Warden route, if you do not take the national route, where  you
will pass children along the route. You travel for over  20  km  along  that
route before you reach a school, and the children would  still  be  trudging
along that route on foot at nine o' clock in the morning.  When  will  those
children get to school?

You will pass more children trudging along  to  school,  after  driving  for
approximately 25 km from the school. When will  those  children  learn?  The
message that we send to Prof Kader Asmal, father Kader Asmal, is that  those
buses that used to take white farmers' children from  the  farms  to  school
should transport these children to school, and get them to school on time.

I am saying this as someone who used to go to school on the  farms.  I  used
to walk the same long distances as the children that  I  see  walking  along
those roads. I used to cross rivers and run to school, afraid that  I  would
arrive late and be beaten for that. After school I would  also  run,  afraid
to get home after dark. Sir, those buses should be put back on the road  and
transport our children. Thank you, Sir. [Laughter.] [Applause.]]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Thank you, Madam Chairperson. Hon Minister and  colleagues,
I also wish to commend the Minister for his informative  budget  speech.  As
already pointed out by some colleagues before me, education is  one  of  the
most important long-term investments a country can provide to its  citizens.
It is also one of the most important means by which the recipients can  push
back the frontiers of poverty. In the North West province a total amount  of
R4,678 billion was allocated towards  education  in  the  2003-04  financial
year.

This amount is approximately 36% of the total budget of  the  province,  and
it is also an increase of 11% on its 2002-03 budget. One of  the  key  focus
areas to be addressed is that of learner support  material,  which  received
R125 million, intended to improve the expenditure per learner from  R170  to
R250 per annum. It was gratifying to  note  that  people  who  were  granted
tenders for the distribution of  these  learner  materials  completed  their
deliveries ahead of the  target  time,  because  the  MEC  responsible  took
personal charge of the process.

Another focus area is the  building  of  the  sanitation  facilities  at  56
schools for a budgeted  amount  of  R50,6  million.  The  recent  hullabaloo
surrounding the fact that at a certain school in the province  the  learners
relieved themselves in a bush on the Botswana side of the border,  and  were
then threatened by pythons, will now be a thing of the past. Our  appeal  is
that cleanliness in these facilities  must  be  emphasised  throughout,  and
that funds be spent for the purposes for which they were allocated.

In the Rabatlabama area a 14-classroom school  was  built  approximately  25
years ago, to accommodate communities from the Ventersdorp  area,  who  were
expected to be settled there during the forced removals of yesteryear.  When
the said community won a court action upholding  their  resistance  to  move
out,  the  school  lay  idle  and  unutilised.  It  was  later  used  as  an
agricultural training centre. When the agricultural projects  in  that  area
collapsed, it lay idle and wasted.

It is consequently recommended  that  the  department  should  consider  the
advisability of  utilising  that  school  to  accommodate  the  learners  of
farmworkers in the area.

In conclusion, Madam Chairperson, I wish to state  that  the  UCDP  supports
this Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you  very  much,  Mr  Tlhagale.  Hon
members, I have been informed that the MEC  for  Education  in  the  Western
Cape, Advocate A H Gaum, has been called very  urgently  to  the  provincial
legislature, and therefore hon Adams will present a speech.

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, I am not in that fortunate position yet. It is  Adv
Gaum's speech and if there is anything controversial the Minister  must  not
be cross with me. [Laughter.]

In almost 10 years of our democracy  a  number  of  important  changes  have
taken place in education. Many of the changes that have  taken  place  since
Minister Asmal  took  office  have  been  beneficial,  acceptable  and  even
praiseworthy. The revision  of  Curriculum  2005,  the  new  salary  grading
system  and  career  pathing  for  educators,  together  with  whole  school
evaluations and performance appraisals  of  individual  teachers  have  been
great developments.

We would like to thank Minister Asmal for  his  enthusiasm  to  bring  about
positive change in the education system  as  a  whole.  Although  we  should
welcome positive change and guard against resistance to change for the  sake
of resistance, we must also make sure that we do not overburden our  schools
by implementing change overhastily.

I would, therefore, like to thank the Minister for  agreeing  to  delay  the
implementation of the new FET to 2006 following the Western Cape's pleas  in
this regard. That has been a good example  of  co-operative  governance.  In
this way we are assisting teachers to get to grips  with  change.  Sometimes
the Minister is unfortunately scratching where it does not itch.

Hy krap waar dit nie  jeuk  nie.  [Gelag.]  Twee  goeie  voorbeelde  in  dié
verband is die kwessie van die sogenaamde "perks"  of  ekstra  voordele  vir
onderwysers, en godsdiens in  skole.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[He is scratching  where  it  does  not  itch.  [Laughter.]  Two  very  good
examples in this regard are the  issue  of  the  so-called  perks  or  extra
benefits for teachers, and religion in schools.]

Instead of first doing a detailed investigation with regard  to  the  nature
and extent of these so-called perks which  can  inform  appropriate  policy,
the Minister is making legislation that  has  the  potential  of  chasing  a
number of educators out of the system.

However,  I  must  acknowledge  that  Minister  Asmal's  budget  day   media
statement was more balanced and took a  softer  approach  than  his  initial
pronouncements on the matter. I am still  convinced  that  school  governing
bodies should be allowed to reward hard work and commitment  and  that  they
should not be restricted, as the Minister aims to do.

Of  course,  there  should  not  be  extravagance  and   there   should   be
transparency. Parents must know what the school fees  they  are  paying  are
being used for. They must be fully informed on the context of budgets.  This
will enable parents to take their SGBs to task.

Maar die baba moet nie met die badwater uitgegooi word nie. Ek  stel  steeds
voor dat daar eers 'n behoorlike  ondersoek  plaasvind.  Ons  moet  daarteen
waak om onderwysers verder te demoraliseer. [But  the  baby  should  not  be
thrown out with  the  bathwater.  I  am  still  proposing  that  a  detailed
investigation be conducted. We should guard  against  demoralising  teachers
even further.]
With regard to the proposed policy on religion in schools,  I  believe  that
the consultation process pertaining to this new policy has left a lot to  be
desired. It is very  awkward  that  this  process  lacks  the  openness  and
transparency that one would have expected from it. Not all stakeholders  are
abreast of developments as far as the policy is concerned and many  of  them
rightfully claim today that they have not been consulted at all.

Why were SGBs not consulted? They have the power to make rules  with  regard
to religious observances in terms  of  the  schools  Act.  Surely  they  are
important stakeholders. Why was the policy not published for public  comment
as is normally the case with new policy  developments?  Why  are  the  draft
documents marked "confidential"? Why the secrecy?

The argument that the development of the policy has  taken  place  over  the
course of many years since the days of former  education  Minister  Sibusiso
Bengu, and that adequate consultations have taken place over the years  does
not hold sway. The reason for this is  that  the  current  draft  policy  is
something very different to the Bengu policy.

In this regard a question could be raised as to why  the  Bengu  policy  has
been thrown out of the window. The  policy  would  clearly  have  been  more
acceptable than the current one. While Minister Bengu accepted a  particular
approach to religion in schools, the  draft  policy  document  is  not  even
considering  it.  The  approach  considers  and  includes  the  secular   or
consultative approaches that  do  not  make  real  provision  for  different
schemes of  religious  practice  developed  by  different  governing  bodies
according  to  the  particular  circumstances  of  the   particular   school
community. It will be interesting to know why Minister  Asmal  has  rejected
former Minister Bengu's policy document.

As far as religious education is concerned, many red  lights  are  flashing.
Why should we introduce it at Grade R level when children  can  be  confused
as the child is not settled within his or  her  own  religious  identity  at
this level? We should  not  introduce  difficult  concepts  with  regard  to
different religions too early. We are pleased that it  has  apparently  been
agreed  with  the  National   Religious   Leaders   Forum   that   religious
organisations will be involved in the development  of  the  content  of  the
religion education curriculum.

However, it remains to be clarified as to who will be utilised  as  religion
educators and who will train them.  It  remains  difficult  to  imagine  how
religion  education  could  be  taught  from  the   position   of   absolute
neutrality. This in itself poses a danger that will not easily be  overcome.
Many people share this concern.

What is most important  at  present  is  that  the  Minister's  position  on
religious observance during school hours should be clarified.  The  Minister
has indeed made some positive remarks in this regard in  the  past  week  or
two.  Some  of  these  remarks  were  captured  in  his  budget  day   media
statements. Unfortunately, these remarks have  not  been  taken  up  in  the
latest draft policy documents.

The latest policy document is still  unconstitutional  as  it  aims  in  the
direction of multifaith assemblies, ignoring  the  constitutional  right  to
religious  observance  and  the  right   to   religious   freedom.   It   is
unconstitutional as  the  Minister's  manifesto  on  values,  education  and
democracy states that religious observance may  be  conducted  only  outside
school hours.

I want to state very clearly today that the humanist multifaith approach  of
the draft policy documents  and  the  underlying  opposition  to  particular
religious observance cannot be accepted by most religious  people  in  South
Africa.

Die  dokument  impliseer  eintlik  dat  die   beoefening   van   partikulêre
godsdienste strydig is met die oogmerk  van  nasiebou.  Dit  getuig  van  'n
inherente onverdraagsaamheid teenoor godsdiens oor die algemeen, en  teenoor
gelowiges in die besonder - wat indruis teen  die  verklaarde  oogmerke  van
die beleid om juis waardes soos wedersydse  respek  en  verdraagsaamheid  te
bevorder. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[The document actually implies that the practice of particular religions  is
contrary to the objectives of nation-building. This attests to  an  inherent
intolerance towards religion in general, and  towards  religious  people  in
particular - which is at variance with the  elucidative  objectives  of  the
policy  to  particularly  promote  values  such  as   mutual   respect   and
tolerance.]

However, I am glad to have learnt a few minutes ago  that,  following  input
from the National Religious Leaders Forum, a revised draft is  being  worked
on at present and will be available at the Council  of  Education  Ministers
meeting on Monday.

With regard to religious observance the  Minister  should  simply  take  the
position that religious observance is allowed during school  hours,  subject
to the Constitution and the SA Schools Act. It  should  also  state  clearly
that the SGBs would be allowed  to  develop  mechanisms  to  adhere  to  the
provisions of the Constitution and the SA Schools Act. To say anything  more
than this makes the  matter  highly  problematic  and  creates  a  potential
conflict with the Constitution and the SA Schools Act.

We trust that we will be able to find common ground with Minister  Asmal  on
this matter, contrary to the impression created by press  reports.  The  New
NP  does  not  claim  that  Minister  Asmal  is  backtracking.  We  are  not
interested in claiming this. We are only interested in finding a solution.

All indications are that the Minister is  indeed  listening  to  the  inputs
made and the many concerns raised pertaining to this matter. We  trust  that
the eventual policy will unite rather than divide people and  that  it  will
be to the satisfaction of the majority of South Africans.

I have great respect for Minister Asmal and  I  am  taking  up  this  matter
because of his great importance, not to  pick  a  fight  or  for  any  other
reason.

Ms J MASHAMBA: Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP, hon  Minister
of Education, Prof Kader Asmal, colleagues, hon  members  of  the  executive
councils from other sister provinces, hon members of this august House,  our
stakeholders in education, distinguished guests,  comrades  and  friends,  I
did not want to respond to what the previous speaker has said  but  I  doubt
if indeed Minister Gaum left because there was a pressing need.

I am suspicious; maybe he did not have enough courage to say  what  he  sent
his deputy to say. But I do not think that we need  to  waste  our  time  in
trying to respond to the petty talk that we  have  just  listened  to.  What
does it mean to say that the Minister is trying to  scratch  where  it  does
not itch when referring in particular to his stance on religion education?

He says that there was no openness and transparency and laments  that  there
is no religious observance and all that. I do not think  that  the  Minister
should allow himself to be derailed. He  is  on  the  right  track  and  has
consulted. The whole process was transparent, unless we  do  not  know  what
other parties mean by transparency.

I also want to say regarding what the Minister said around the rewards  that
SGBs are giving to people for what they call hard  work  and  commitment,  I
think he is quite correct; let him stamp his foot  and  not  allow  anarchy,
and he should also not  entertain  a  free-for-all  kind  of  situation.  He
should not allow the maintenance of the status quo.  I  think  the  Minister
spoke very well about  the  redressing  of  imbalances.  This  is  what  the
Minister needs to stick to.

This policy debate takes place on the eve of the  completion  of  the  first
decade of our hard-fought-for democratic dispensation. As we engage in  this
debate  today,  we  look  back  on  the  nine  years  of   this   democratic
dispensation with a sense of pride and fulfilment.

Although  we  know  the  challenges  that  still  confront  us  and  certain
shortcomings in our efforts  to  transform  and  reconstruct  our  education
system, on most fronts we are pleased with the strides we have made  towards
empowering our people through the provisioning of quality education. We  say
this, however, knowing only too well that the road ahead is still  long  and
the battle is far from over.

We stand here today from the Limpopo province to proudly pronounce  that  we
have indeed gone a long way in our concerted  struggle  to  provide  quality
public education to our people, ranging from Grade R to  FET  and  Abet.  We
also stand here to recommit and  rededicate  ourselves  to  our  resolve  to
spare neither courage nor strength in our struggle to  obliterate  the  deep
wounds and visible scars that have been  inflicted  on  our  people  by  the
obnoxious system of Bantu education.

Much as we have recorded some decisive victories in a number of  battles  on
the educational front, we are not ready to rest on our laurels until we  are
certain that the doors of learning and teaching are open to  all  regardless
of race, gender, ability, etc. We shall only  declare  victory  and  say  we
have achieved when none of our children receive their education under  trees
or in dilapidated shacks that are not conducive to  educative  teaching  and
learning; when every learner receives his learner support material  on  time
so that learning and teaching start on the first day of school;  when  every
school in our province caters for the academic needs  of  all  our  children
irrespective of race, colour, religion, language or culture; when  each  and
every school is a safe environment free of drugs, guns and abuse; when  each
and every school has an effective and efficient school governing body  whose
composition reflects the demographics of the school community in so  far  as
the parent, educator, noneducator and learner components' representivity  is
concerned and when all our educators are empowered to inculcate  the  values
of education in our learners.

These are but a few examples of areas  where  we  need  urgent  improvement.
These are, however, not the only areas where we need to improve. I  want  to
introduce something that I think is going to answer one  of  our  colleagues
who spoke of white elephants that  are  standing  unutilised.  Our  province
inherited 22 colleges of  education  in  1994.  It  is  known  that  teacher
education is the competence of  the  national  Department  of  Education  in
terms of The Higher Education Act, Act 101 of  1997.  In  terms  of  section
21(2) of the same Act we have rationalised 13  of  our  former  colleges  of
education into what we refer to as education multipurpose  centres.  We  did
this with the help of the various stakeholders, who joined hands to  suggest
in what way we could best make use of those facilities. So, I would  suggest
that our member from the UCDP should, as a good  parliamentarian,  delegate;
and, as a good NCOP person, go to the Department of Education and come  with
suggestions as to what they can do to make those centres work. I  will  also
convey to our Comrade Tolo that it looks like the comrade  wants  to  assist
him in suggesting what those centres should be used for.

Back to what I said about our education  multipurpose  centres,  our  vision
for these centres is to facilitate the process of lifelong learning,  skills
acquisition and resource mobilisation  to  realise  the  objectives  of  the
provincial growth and development strategy, the rural  development  strategy
and the human resource needs of our province. In  all  the  programmes  that
are offered in these EMPCs strong emphasis is  placed  on  social  awareness
and understanding so that we develop well-rounded citizens who do  not  only
have the technical know-how, but who are acutely  aware  of  and  understand
the dynamics of broader social issues such as race, gender, culture, etc.

We envisage that the education multipurpose centres will  serve  as  centres
for implementing our training of trainers programme, to  skill  and  empower
our educators on creative ways of infusing  values  in  education  in  their
lessons.

The following are some of the programmes that are being implemented  in  our
education multipurpose centres: a schools support programme  that  is  aimed
at  the  enhancement  of  teaching  and  learning  in  the   classroom   and
institutional  change;  development  and  capacity-building  programmes  for
school  management  teams,  school  governing  bodies   and   representative
councils  for  learners;  and  community  development  programmes  targeting
mainly the  youth,  women  and  the  disabled.  Our  education  multipurpose
centres will also serve as continuous  professional  developmental  centres,
where our educators will continually be empowered to implement  the  revised
and streamlined Curriculum 2005 with confidence.

Mr Minister, through these education multipurpose centres we  hope  that  we
have in a small way responded to  your  call  for  making  our  institutions
centres of community life as espoused in the Tirisano Call to Action.

I also want to touch on school effectiveness.  Whilst  it  is  difficult  to
measure school  effectiveness  with  any  measure  of  precision,  Grade  12
results to a great extent serve  as  a  key  performance  indicator  of  the
effectiveness of our schools. Our Grade  12  results  at  the  end  of  2002
confirmed our status as the fastest improving province when  we  recorded  a
69,5% pass rate, which is a 10%  improvement  on  the  59,5%  of  2001.  Our
success can only be attributed to a number of intervention strategies  aimed
at enhancing performance of both our educators and learners  throughout  the
system. Our intervention strategies include, but are  not  limited  to,  the
learner performance enhancement strategy, that is Saturday classes  focusing
on maths, science, biology, technology, English, accounting,  economics  and
business economics, as well as  the  Dinaledi  project,  mentorship  by  our
maths and science teachers of the year, and winter enhancement classes.

I also want to briefly touch on crime in our schools.  We  are  saddened  by
isolated incidences of gangsterism that have bedevilled our schools  in  the
recent few weeks. Reports of the deaths of our learners through gunshot  and
stab wounds are disturbing. We are encouraged to learn that the Ministry  of
Safety and Security is prioritising this kind of crime in ensuring that  our
children are safe and secured. On our part we are working very closely  with
the provincial department of safety and  security  and  liaising  to  ensure
that they will rid our schools of these crimes. We call  upon  our  SGBs  to
come up with innovative programmes  to  make  sure  that  our  children  and
educators are safe from rogue elements who are hellbent  on  destroying  the
culture of teaching and learning.

We also call on our parents, and upon society in general, to assist  because
this is not only a problem that starts at school. The yoke  of  transforming
education  is  not  light.  Equally,  the  burden  of   reconstructing   and
developing the education system is not easy.

Unzima lo mthwalo, ufuna sibambisane. [This is a heavy  burden,  it  demands
co-operation from all of us.] O boima morwalo o batla re tshwarisane.  [This
yoke is heavy. We need to assist one another.]  Wa  tika  ndzhwalo  lowu  wu
lava leswaku hi khomisana, hi tlhuvutsa edzhovo ngopfu eka  lava  va  tivaka
laha hi humaka kona hi timhaka ka dyondzo. [This yoke is heavy. We  need  to
assist one another in addressing the problems we encounter,  especially  for
those who know where we came from with regard to education issues.]

That is why we in the Limpopo  Department  of  Education  have  adopted  the
slogan which guides our day to day  operations.  We  say  we  need  to  find
solutions  to  educational  challenges  before  starting   engagements   and
participation until the doors of learning are open for all. [Time expired.]

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon  Minister,  hon  special  delegates
and hon colleagues, though of diminutive stature,  the  hon  Minister,  like
Baby Jake Matlala, does pack a powerful punch with his hands-on approach  to
matters under his regime. Today  he  has  yet  again  given  us  a  virtuoso
performance in highlighting the achievements of the Ministry.  We  certainly
- that is the Official Opposition - acknowledge that  since  the  advent  of
democracy, great strides have been made in certain areas of education.

But I think it was the Scottish poet Robert Burns,  who  in  his  ode  To  a
Mouse said, and I quote:


  The best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men
  Gang aft agley.
The  noblest  intentions  sometimes  go  awry.  I  consider  this  quotation
apposite because it encapsulates the situation  in  which  Government  finds
itself today. The ANC Government, it must be noted, must  be  credited  with
introducing into the Statute Book some of the finest pieces of  legislation,
whether it be on human rights, services, public transport or  education.  We
make good laws but are we able to execute those laws and  regulations  in  a
pragmatic  fashion  so  as  to  benefit  the  masses  in   whose   interests
legislation in the new democratic order is primarily intended to  facilitate
delivery? A lack of resources, lack of  skilled  personnel  or  the  hideous
twins of fraud and corruption usually  take  centre  stage  in  marring  the
physiognomy of the  delivery  of  services,  in  the  failure  to  translate
excellent legislation into practical benefit to the intended beneficiaries.

  The buzz words presumed are, and I quote: "to push back the frontiers  of
  poverty". I am constrained to pose rhetorical questions after  reading  a
  news article in the Sunday Tribune of 1 June entitled:
  Biting the hand that feeds children


  There are claims that corruption in school feeding  schemes  is  stealing
  nourishment from hungry kids, writes Philani Makhanya.

The national Minister of Education must immediately be complimented ...

Mr M A SULLIMAN:  Chair,  is  it  parliamentary  for  a  member  to  read  a
newspaper in the House?

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I think, hon member, as you are  aware,  it  is
parliamentary to quote from a newspaper but not to spend  the  time  reading
the newspaper. You may proceed, Mr Raju.

Mr N M  RAJU:  The  national  Minister  of  Education  must  immediately  be
complimented for the handsome increase in  the  budget  for  the  integrated
nutrition programme to a massive R800  million  for  the  current  year  and
increasing to more than R1 billion in the medium term.

This increase underlines the claim that  the  ANC  Government  is  indeed  a
caring Government and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry  of  Social
Development, to use colloquial terminology, are putting  their  money  where
their mouths are. But, sadly, the increase in  the  nutritional  budget  has
unleashed a frenzied  orgy  of  fraudulent  claims,  misuse  of  funds,  the
sprouting of ghost suppliers and so on. Funds intended for  the  feeding  of
pupils from poverty-stricken communities are siphoned off into  illegitimate
coffers.

Mr Zenzele Mngoma, chairman of the Natal school  food  supply  organisation,
has angrily challenged the Government in the  news  article  to  investigate
allegations of corruption which is taking on proportions  of  a  many-headed
hydra with an insatiable appetite  for  illegal  acquisition  of  Government
funds.

The article cites many instances of corruption and fraud. Yet more cases  of
impropriety are stated in the Echo,  a  supplement  of  the  Natal  Witness,
dated 15  May  2003.  Thousands  of  impoverished  children  in  Vulindlela,
Edendale are going hungry as  the  Department  of  Health  cuts  its  school
feeding scheme and reduces the number of schools. Rural schools in the  deep
rural areas are left to starve.

A disturbing feature described is the high  absentee  and  dropout  rate  in
schools, directly as a result of children moving to  schools  where  feeding
takes place from schools where there is no feeding. There  seems  to  be  no
control over who should be the food  suppliers.  There  are  allegations  of
school principals, SCMs, educators and even  polititians  involved  in  food
supplies. Association spokesman Mr Menzi Ndabazita attributes  the  collapse
of the feeding scheme in some schools  to  corruption  and  failure  to  pay
suppliers by the schools. He says that:


   We are investigating a number of cases in which teachers, civil servants
  and principals are contracted  as  suppliers  and  that  gives  room  for
  corruption.

Ms L N JAJULA (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, hon  members,
ladies and gentlemen, it's quite exciting  to  rise  at  this  moment,  when
people have dreamt and decided to  put  on  spectacles  through  which  they
cannot see what is happening in South Africa. They've decided  not  to  look
at what is actually taking place within the Department of Education.

However, I need to say to you, hon Chairperson, that  I'm  very  excited  to
have this opportunity to map out  the  budget  allocation  for  the  2002-03
financial year.  This  budget  is  not  only  for  deploying  resources  and
financial resources, but  is  entrusted  with  providing  the  learners  and
educators with the necessary care.  The  budget  will  reflect  a  strategic
focus in order not  only  to  achieve  its  objectives,  but  to  create  an
atmosphere that is conducive to learning.

In order to better  understand  the  implications  of  this  budget,  it  is
important to understand where  we  come  from  and  where  we  are  heading.
Especially, as the Eastern  Cape,  we  need  to  give  this  House  a  clear
perspective of where we are at the present  moment.  One  can  only  achieve
these goals if one understands the current realities.

Just to make a reflection: As you sit  to  watch  television,  you  need  to
understand and link this to the speech that I'm going to make now.

The Eastern Cape is moving from the  premise  that  we've  accommodated  2,1
million learners and 6 642 schools. We started with a backlog of  more  than
21 248 classrooms from the doomed policies  of  those  that  claim  to  know
better today. That is in respect  of  1994.  We've  managed  to  reduce  the
backlog during the past financial year to 14 000 classrooms.

Added to this challenge is a number of schools, totalling 1  487,  at  which
we need to establish some ablution blocks or toilets, and a total of  1  972
schools with no water supply. We need to reflect that the number of  schools
that need school fields  is  4 333  and  that  some  of  them  do  not  have
electricity. Almost 90% of the schools in  the  Eastern  Cape  do  not  have
laboratories and libraries. That is  a  true  reflection  of  where  we  are
presently.

We are not sitting there and watching, but what the Government has  done  in
the past few years is that it  increased  funding  for  infrastructure  from
R249 million during the financial year  1995-96.  We  have  been  increasing
this amount by R75  million  per  year.  We  are  proud  to  say  that  this
financial year we have increased the  budget  now  to  R4 000  448,  with  a
target of 420 schools to be built this year.

To ensure that the school renovation programme is moving on, the amount  set
aside for this purpose has been increased from R11 million  to  R90  million
this year. For the day-to-day repairs,  we  are  increasing  the  budget  as
well.

The province has a population of 6 000 900 people, and the majority of  them
- 63% - live in the rural areas. That is a true reflection of  the  province
of the  Eastern  Cape.  The  breakdown  of  this  63%  is  as  follows:  the
unemployment and  illiteracy  rates  are  very  high;  there  is  poor  road
infrastructure; schoolchildren live in poverty and the areas are very poor.

I want, briefly, to contribute  towards  the  elimination  of  unemployment,
illiteracy, etc.

Now I will address the unemployment levels and  infrastructure.  Our  school
repairs programme involves  the  communities  on  a  large  scale.  We  have
provided job opportunities for the unemployed by allowing them to engage  in
the repairs of school buildings. When the previous financial year  ended  on
31 March  2003,  we  had  generated  25  716  jobs.  The  breakdown  of  the
beneficiaries is: 8 978 men and 7 644 women. The breakdown on  job  creation
for these people is: 5 746 males, 3 093 females, 177 disabled males  and  78
disabled females.

Further, regarding infrastructure, we  have  encouraged  women  to  go  into
construction. Six construction companies were  awarded  tenders  during  the
past financial year. And this alone reflects that the amount for  the  youth
project this financial year is R56 million.
We want to ensure, as the Department of Education, that the youth out  there
receive the necessary skills, that repairs are done  and  that  unemployment
is reduced, to the best of our ability.

The illiteracy rate in the province is very high, as I  indicated.  A  total
of 700 000 people in the province are said to be illiterate, and that has  a
negative impact on the  socioeconomic  scenario,  and  this  is  disturbing.
Therefore, the province has improved education through Abet, that  is  Adult
Basic Education and Training.

We have increased the total budget for Abet to R20  million  this  financial
year. This year we are increasing it to R131  million.  In  order  for  Abet
practitioners to develop a curriculum and  learning  material,  we  need  to
improve their skills as well.

We recorded the highest enrolment throughout South Africa, with  the  others
recording 49 124 illiterate persons enrolled during the past financial  year
or during the national exams. We have recorded the best results, and we  are
very proud to be one of the provinces that have for the first time  improved
their Grade 4 results.

During the 2001 exams  only  6%  of  learners  had  enrolled  for  technical
studies and they passed. We also have a pass rate  of  68%  in  Adult  Basic
Education. But what makes us proud is that the Xhosa language in  this  area
had the highest pass rate, namely 97%.

We are encouraged by the hard  work  done  by  the  dedicated  learners  and
educators at school. We have quite a number  of  schools  that  need  to  be
assisted with scholars' transport, owing to the fact that  the  majority  of
scholars live in rural areas. As a department we are  determined  to  reduce
the travelling distance to five kilometres or less,  and  we  have  provided
additional  scholar  transport  this  financial  year.  We   offer   scholar
transport to learners in 13 of  the  24  districts.  We  are  determined  to
increase this number.

At the present moment the focus is on farm schools,  especially  around  the
central, western and northern parts of the province. The transport  will  be
extended to the eastern part of the province, to areas such as Mount  Frere,
Maluti, Bizana, Qumbu, Idutywa and Umtata. We have  realised  that  learners
travel very long  distances  to  school.  It  is  important  then  that  the
department contributes R50 per learner for scholar transport this  financial
year.

We have made sure that the vehicles that transport learners  are  roadworthy
and as sister departments, that is with the Departments of Transport and  of
Safety and Security, we have ensured that the drivers  ...  [Time  expired.]

                         REMOVAL OF PROPOSED MOTION

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, before I call on  the  next
speaker, I would like to make a ruling on  the  objection  that  was  raised
against a motion moved by the hon Dr Nel. I have checked the Hansard  record
with respect to the motions moved during the sitting yesterday  and  I  have
satisfied myself that the motion proposed  by  Dr  Nel  is  similar  to  the
motion moved by the hon Ms Versfeld. As a result, it transgresses the  rules
of the National Council of Provinces and must  therefore  fall  away.  Thank
you very much. [Interjections.] Order!

Ms R P MASHANGOANE: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister of  Education,  hon
members, distinguished guests of the education fraternity.

Motlhomphegi Joyce Mashamba, o tloge o le mmagwebana wa go  swara  thipa  ka
bogaleng. Wathinth' abafazi, wathintha imbokodo! [Hon  Joyce  Mashamba,  you
are indeed a woman who stands for what she believes in. You strike a  woman,
you strike a rock!]

Chairperson, let me not waste my time by  responding  to  arme  [poor]  Oupa
Raju. Oupa Raju, cameleons always change colours. And you have changed  good
ideas and colours because of the coat you are wearing.
Sepedi se re: Mogo ga o butswe ka go bona tshwene. [In Sepedi  we  say:  You
cannot ask for something because you see it.]

This ANC Government, and  indeed  this  democratically  elected  Parliament,
have a track record of delivering in this nation's education over  the  last
10 years that will remain unsurpassed. What is even more gratifying  is  the
extent to which we have  over  the  second  five  years  increased  delivery
through expanded  policy  implementation  and  legislative  measures.  These
include  the  Ministry's  White  Paper  on  Education  and  Training  in   a
Democratic South Africa. This document adopted as  its  point  of  departure
the  1994  Education  Policy  Framework  of  our  party.   After   extensive
consultation, negotiation  and  revision,  it  was  approved  by  our  first
Cabinet and has served as a fundamental reference for subsequent policy  and
legislative development.

The National Education Policy Act of 1996 was also designed to  inscribe  in
law policies as well as the legislative and monitoring  responsibilities  of
the  Minister  of  Education  and  for  formalising  relationships   between
national and provincial authorities.

Other  legislation  which  provides  further  impetus   for   transformation
includes the South African Schools Act, which  promotes  access  to  quality
and democratic governance in the  schooling  system.  It  ensures  that  all
learners  have  the  right  of   access   to   quality   education   without
discrimination and makes schooling compulsory for children aged 7 to 14.

Through Tirisano, we have achieved  greater  stability  in  our  schools  as
evidenced  by  increased  basic  school  functionality,   the   ability   of
provincial education systems to manage both human  resources  and  financial
policy and a clearer focus on delivery and implementation.

Our vision is of a South Africa in which all our people  have  equal  access
to lifelong education  and  training  opportunities  which  will  contribute
towards improving their quality of life and  build  a  peaceful,  prosperous
and democratic South  Africa.  This  can  only  be  achieved  if  we  commit
ourselves to pushing back the frontiers of poverty. In this regard, we  have
identified our  core  programme  that  will  guide  the  activities  of  the
Department of Education in relation to school effectiveness over the medium-
term years.

In order to address the school effectiveness at the macro level, we  commend
the department for its holistic approach  to  ensure  access  to  resources.
During the past financial year we have witnessed the opening of a number  of
school libraries for use by a  cluster  of  schools  and  communities.  This
programme is extending into the present financial year,  together  with  the
upgrading of school  and  community  recreational  facilities.  Increasingly
schools are  being  resourced  with  laboratories  and  greater  numbers  of
qualified mathematics, science and  technology  educators  are  being  drawn
into schools where the needs exist. With  the  national  schools  sanitation
and water strategy in place, the backlogs  in  the  nodal  areas  have  been
reduced remarkably.
In terms of the Thubamakota Poverty Alleviation  Programme,  multifunctional
schools designed, constructed and managed for community purposes  have  been
constructed. Our commitment as the ANC to  eradicating  poverty  is  further
underscored with the vegetable garden projects in  our  schools  and  active
community participation  in  these  projects.  These  projects  ensure  that
learners have food on their desks.

Moreover, we are assisting provinces in the elimination of  instances  where
children  are  forced  to  receive  education  in  unsafe  and  nonconducive
environments. In respect of the latter, we endeavour to reduce instances  of
children receiving education under trees by 50% by the end  of  the  2003-04
financial year.

Another priority which is central in our onslaught against  poverty  is  our
HIV/Aids programme. First  and  foremost,  and  most  importantly,  we  will
support learners infected  and  affected  by  the  pandemic.  Our  strategic
objectives are to ensure adequate  access  to  appropriate  information  for
learners. We will provide guidelines on  peer  education  for  learners  and
students in selected areas as well as promoting  visible  related  materials
for learners in selected areas. Moreover,  we  will  empower  our  educators
with access to information. These include emergency guidelines  on  HIV/Aids
and the national  training  programme  for  peer  educators  on  prevention,
management of Aids and basic counselling in selected areas.

In addition, reference material will be  distributed  to  educators  in  the
nodes and condom distribution is to be launched at all  schools.  This  ANC-
led Government ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, as I said at the beginning, it is  a
pleasure to be here in this House, to take  part  in  the  debates.  I  must
compliment the reports of  the  different  provinces.  There  are  obviously
enormous improvements and changes taking place.

As is the case with us in the ANC, I do not have  to  apologise  to  anyone.
Many of the MECs were self-critical. I was very impressed  by  some  of  the
younger members saying ``we need to do this'', ``we need to do that'',  ``we
will come to Abet'', ``we will talk about the advances we made''. They  have
made concrete suggestions  and  proposals  for  the  next  year,  and  I  am
grateful for that, because they are really using their capacity  to  present
to this House their own information and ideas.  I  might  not  always  agree
with my brothers and sisters; the emphasis might be different.

 But what do you do? An hon member of this House stands up  and  quotes  for
his six minutes from a newspaper. [Interjections.]  The  whole  contribution
is from a newspaper. What do you do in a  situation  like  that?  He  quoted
from a tendentious piece, which I had read before. The reason  it  is  being
transferred from the KwaZulu-Natal department of health  to  the  department
of education is the very reason  the  hon  member  Mr  Raju  mentioned.  Not
another penny of the R800 million will be spent now. So, far from doing  his
homework and research, he treats this House with contempt by reading from  a
wretched Sunday newspaper. Is that the correct thing to  do  in  the  House?
Being attacked by him  is  really  like  being  savaged  by  a  dead  sheep,
frankly. [Laughter.] There is no other way I can describe that.

Of course, you show your appreciation for a debate where people  have  taken
a considerable amount of pain and time to take part in that debate. Some  of
them  are  really  cries  from  the  heart,  for  change,  development   and
improvement. And then you get this extraordinary farcical  situation,  of  a
total  lack  of  research  by  his  party  which  has,  to  judge  from  the
newspapers, enormous capacity.

Secondly, I think the hon Mr Mzizi should lie down with  the  hon  Mr  Raju,
since you are in  any  case  flirting  with  each  other  in  KwaZulu-Natal.
[Laughter.] I think you will  make  a  perfect  pair,  actually.  Ideas  and
information will never affect your relationship. You will not be  soured  by
any information or facts. They will never get in the way.

You ask about the crisis  in  education.  You  say  grudgingly  that  matric
examination results have gone up, but ``is  there  quality''?  Now  I  don't
know when you started having an interest in  the  quality  of  education.  I
said at the beginning: we've been spending all this money, now we must  look
at the quality of education, the effectiveness of education.

Let me tell you where the crisis is. There have been two national  Ministers
of Education. In the Northern Cape there has been  one  MEC  for  education,
and in Gauteng there has been one MEC.  In  KwaZulu-Natal  there  have  been
seven MECs for education since 1994! [Interjections.] I  got  on  very  well
with five of them, because I saw them work  together.  I  did  not  know  Mr
Zulu. I loved Nkosi Shandu, Faith Gaza, Ndabandaba. I worked very well  with
them. Interposed between them was the hon  premier  who  acted  as  MEC  for
education twice. [Interjections.] He is the one  who  covered  himself  with
glory when he appointed the hon Mr  Ndabandaba,  a  good  educationist,  and
said: ``I want to mentor him indefinitely.'' Now this was the first time  in
the world when someone was appointed  to  public  office  and  his  superior
said: ``I will be headmaster and look after you, and see you  do  the  right
things.'' Well, in fact, he was not allowed to do anything at all!

All these MECs, apart from Prince Zulu whom I did not know, were  honourable
people who did their work honourably. I hope Narend Singh, whom I  respected
when I was Minister of Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  and  he  was  MEC  for
agriculture, will be allowed to do the work that the  other  MECs  here  are
doing.

I think it is very important that the hon Zulu does not play games  with  us
here. There is no crisis nationally. On  the  contrary,  we  work  with  the
officials collectively. We actually do work collectively. It is  unusual  in
governance that we work collectively. I am not  a  person  who  is  reticent
about things. I am not shy about things. My job  is  to  raise  issues  with
them on a Monday morning. They hate me coming to  the  office  on  a  Monday
morning, because of what I have conjured up over the weekend. And we  thrash
it out, like we  are  thrashing  out  the  whole  question  of  the  Schools
Amendment Bill,  which  we  will  be  looking  at,  about  the  question  of
additional payment.

The hon Gaum also showed his contempt for this  House.  This  is  a  central
part of the national Parliament. You don't invoke other activities  outside.
You don't ask people to read your  speech  without  the  permission  of  the
Whips or the Speaker or the Chair or the Minister, as a courtesy.  You  make
this extraordinary speech which has no relationship to the  province's  work
in education.

It is also, secondly, in breach of co-operative governance, because  we  are
going to discuss this at the Council of Education Ministers. The Council  of
Education Ministers then recommends the policy to  be  formulated.  That  is
what we are going to do in Durban on Monday, unless the  hon  Mzizi  puts  a
picket on the place and drives us out of Durban. [Laughter.] Yes,  he  might
do anything like that! But I know who has done it then, if I am  driven  out
of Durban.

Co-operative governance  means  you  work  together,  and  you  come  to  an
arrangement. If the arrangement is not correct,  then  you  don't  go  to  a
court or threaten  to  go  to  the  Constitutional  Court.  His  likes  have
threatened this Government with courts since 1994, and every time they  have
gone there, like with the National  Education  Policy  Act,  which  the  hon
chairperson of the ANC will remember was  highly  controversial,  they  were
knocked for a six. They were knocked out of the court.

Everything we do, we do with the  presumption  of  constitutionality.  As  a
lawyer,  I  will  not  introduce  legislation  which  I   know   myself   is
unconstitutional. But you cannot invoke the Constitution  as  an  impediment
for every progressive piece of legislation we have  introduced  since  1994.
So I say to them: ``I'll see you in court.''

The other thing: I mentioned at the beginning that one  of  the  virtues  of
coming to this House is that you listen  to  special  delegates,  MECs,  who
come with the authority of the province. Hon Mr Gaum does not speak for  the
Western Cape. The majority of the members of that legislative  assembly  are
ANC  members.  I  represent  ANC  policy.  I  speak  for  ANC  policy  here.
[Interjections.] And, of course, ANC policy ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Please,  hon
members, the Minister is on the floor.

The MINISTER  OF  EDUCATION:  We  have  the  majority  in  that  legislative
assembly. We do, and he has not sought  the  consent  of  the  ANC  element,
either in the cabinet or in  the  legislative  assembly.  I  think  we  have
discussed this matter, as to what happens when someone makes  a  speech  for
the press, presumably; delivers a speech and goes away without  taking  into
account the genuine issues that arise.

Let me say that I hope that this House, at  an  early  stage,  will  have  a
debate, a very concrete one, on the funding and the  pricing  of  education.
It is an enormously important document. It is a unique document prepared  by
us. It is self-critical, but also promotes the way as to how  to  deal  with
the pro-poor policies. I will make myself  available  and  we  will  have  a
debate here, which will look at, for  example,  the  cost  of  uniforms  and
fees. We are saying 40% of the poor should  never  pay  fees.  That  is  the
proposal. I cannot tell you what was discussed in the Cabinet,  but  it  was
favourably received by the Joint  Cabinet  Committee.  I  cannot  anticipate
what the Cabinet will do next week, of course, but is was  very  favourably,
and unanimously so, received. We are on the way.

Regarding the whole  issue  of  transport,  we  have  been  talking  to  the
Minister of Transport, and the MECs, saying that no  child  should  have  to
walk more than five kilometers to school. I walked four kilometers. Lots  of
people walked three or four kilometers, not 24. And we will be able  to  co-
ordinate this whole question of subsidies  for  transport,  for  taxis,  and
other very exciting proposals made here as to how we deal with this.

It is the same with the farm schools. You see, Mr Adams is a member  of  the
ANC delegation here. We allowed this as part of  a  co-operative  agreement.
Then he spoke very movingly about farm schools. I  did  not  understand  the
rest of what he said, but he spoke very movingly about  farm  schools.  This
is a matter that is central to the provinces  of  the  Free  State  and  the
North West, because 60% of the kids in the Free State go  to  farm  schools,
or went to farm schools. One solution has been offered now.

But I brought three farmers to Parliament,  very  large  and  tough-looking,
for the National Assembly debate, and they are actively involved in  working
with the community to renew these schools in  the  district.  That  is  why,
when the portfolio committee went to the  Free  State,  they  said  actually
that the Minister should invite these three farmers. And we  did.  That's  a
new opening for the hon Mr Raju.

 But we are doing these things, with co-operation of people who  five,  ten,
fifteen years ago would not have passed the time of day with us.  What  they
are seeing now are the new virtues of a common citizenship, what the  French
call the ideal of the republic, all the values that come from  living  in  a
republic. Some people have difficulties, of course - they don't live in  the
Republic of KwaZulu-Natal, sorry, South Africa.  [Laughter.]  So  those  who
live in a republic have this enormous advantage, and I am  a  self-confessed
republican.

Can I say also, in reply to many of the suggestions made here, that some  of
them, in fact many of them, are very promotive. For example, Abet has  taken
off in the Western Cape, but the previous MEC did  not  allocate  money  for
Abet. The figures I have for Abet now are really remarkable. There  are  now
400 000 people in literacy  programmes,  100  000  in  800  adult  education
learning centres. That has all been done in the last two or three years.

I am not satisfied, as I said publicly, about the developments here, but  as
regards  the  relationship  between  the  South  African  National  Literacy
Initiative and Unisa, they planned to enrol 90 000 adults  this  year.  This
is a very  successful  one.  They  have  already  registered  over  190  000
students, and 93 000 in the Eastern Cape alone. So we set out to  do  Sanli,
our project, with Unisa, to register 90 000. We  now  have  190  000,  which
shows that there is an insatiable desire  among  our  people  to  learn,  to
better themselves, or in fact just to become literate.

And I would say to the hon Mr Mzizi, since  illiteracy  is  the  highest  in
KwaZulu-Natal,  I  think  he  should  use  his  extraordinary  capacity   to
influence his hon premier to say they should be party to this huge  rolling-
out of the literacy programme. I mean that very seriously, by  the  way.  Of
course we were had, but don't say there is chaos.

Can I say, therefore, that I would have liked to have  referred  to  one  or
two other matters, for example the whole question of teacher perks. We  will
debate it here when the Bill comes here. The hon Gaum is not here. The  fact
is, for the last five years the law has been broken.  We  have  criminalised
teachers. What we are now saying is that the school  governing  body  should
play  a  central  role  in  determinings,  openly,  transparently,  with  no
favouritism and no cronyism between headmaster and approved teachers.
The other thing also, of course, is that we have to recognise  that  we  are
working on incentives. We are trying to get people to go  and  work  in  the
rural areas and give them other special financial  incentives.  The  problem
is that there is very little housing in the rural areas.  So  hon  Mr  Mzizi
should use his influence with the traditional leaders, to say  that  one  of
the building projects should be to build houses for teachers in  this  area.
I mean this seriously. The traditional leaders can perform very useful  work
then, rather than trying to say that they should  be  the  local  authority.
They could perform useful work and then we  can  get  our  teachers  to  the
rural areas.

I understood that in Ingwavuma, when  I  went  there,  there  were  overseas
volunteers who were sleeping on the ground and in tents. That is  wonderful.
Our people are not prepared to do that permanently.

The other issue which I did not have  time  to  mention,  is  that  we  have
enormous development support from overseas, and only  our  Government  could
do that. The other day I agreed with  the  European  Union  that  over  R260
million over the next three years will be devoted  largely  to  the  Eastern
Cape,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  Mpumalanga.  That  will  be  for  school-building
projects, maintenance and classrooms. That means that from two sources,  the
Japanese and the  European  Union,  and  the  British  government,  we  have
received nearly R800  million  for  school  development  programmes.  It  is
because they trust us in the department.

Contrary to what Mr Raju says,  we  have  no  problem  with  implementation.
There are special problems in the provinces, which we  are  now  looking  at
very carefully, but implementation takes  place,  with  all  the  associated
issues that arise with implementation, firstly, of very  important  tenders;
secondly, following the procedures laid down; and  thirdly,  supervision  by
the donor country. So the fact that  we  are  able  to  call  upon  so  many
resources from overseas shows the confidence in our Government.

I will therefore say that regarding all  the  issues  raised  here,  I  will
engage with you. Come and talk to me. We don't  drink  skokiaan  -  being  a
good person in my department. We will talk about  discipline,  no  skokiaan.
The hon Chairperson of the NCOP is looking at me very carefully and  I  must
be on my best behaviour. [Laughter.]

The  issue  therefore  is:  on  the  ground  there  are  remarkable   things
happening, regarding individual headmistresses, women teachers,  regrouping,
reorganisation. Last year we  trained  40 000  of  73  000  undertrained  or
untrained teachers. An amount of R100 million was  spent  by  the  Education
Labour Relations Council. We reduced unqualified and semiqualified  teachers
by nearly half. All that can only be done if there is political  inspiration
in the provinces and the national Government. It can only  be  done  because
you care about the people you are dealing  with.  The  very  famous  English
writer E M Forster said that  the  only  thing  in  life  is  that  we  must
connect. We are connecting.  We  are  connecting  communities  now,  we  are
connecting teacher unions, we are connecting with parents' associations,  we
are connecting with young people.

You must not judge our education system  by  headlines.  There  are  27  000
schools. There are 12,5 million children in 27 000 schools.  The  conclusion
you draw from that is, as the  President  said,  that  we  have  turned  the
corner. We turned the corner five, six years ago. We are consolidating  what
we are doing now.

On the other hand, those three people who took part here, they don't  really
believe in principles. They want me to act as Groucho Marx once said,  about
40 years ago:


  These are my principles. If you don't like them, I have others.

[Laughter.] We don't do that.

Thank you very much. I think it has been a superb debate. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

[Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, provincial representatives  and  hon  members  of
this honourable House, the main  obstacle  that  we  have  is  to  eradicate
poverty and lack of development  and  create  a  better  life  for  all  our
people. As leaders of this House we have the responsibility to come up  with
strategies to eradicate poverty.

 Our main purpose today is to discuss our understanding  as  this  House  of
what governance is and how we can contribute to  eradicating  poverty.  Good
governance should  be  understood  in  terms  of  the  stipulations  of  the
Constitution  and  respect  for  the  rights  of  human  beings.   Equality,
accountability and transparency go together. As the  NCOP  we  believe  that
governance  can  be  illustrated  in  the  way  in  which  co-ordination  is
established  amongst  the  different  sections   or   departments   of   our
Government.

The oversight function of this House is to focus on this co-ordination.  Our
oversight function would include, amongst other things, enacting  laws  and,
secondly, to see to it that such laws are conformed to.

Good governance is the  best  way  to  eradicate  poverty  and  develop  our
country in different ways. This  is  only  possible  when  all  sections  of
government display their programmes of action. People have a right  to  know
what is being done in a particular section or department. This House  has  a
responsibility to see to it that different sections and departments  perform
their functions.

There  is  some  connection  between  what  is  generally  referred  to   as
oversight,  governance  and  sustainable  development  as  we  continue  our
struggle against poverty.  If  we  as  a  House  succeed  in  our  oversight
function, the battle against poverty would be won.

In terms of what comes out of the committee that deals  with  oversight  and
accountability, after nine  years  of  the  democratic  dispensation,  South
Africans  still  do  not  have  the  same  understanding  of   the   concept
"oversight".]

This lack of common understanding of  the  oversight  role  has  meant  that
different committees understand their oversight role differently. This is  a
natural result of the lack of a common understanding of the oversight  role.
In order to address this shortcoming, there is a very strong view  that  the
Joint  Rules  Committee  should  compile  a   document   mapping   all   the
constitutional   provisions   dealing   with   oversight,    accountability,
transparency and responsiveness as the basis for the development of a  broad
understanding of the oversight role and purpose of Parliament.

Although we  are  still  grappling  to  develop  a  sound  understanding  of
Parliament's oversight role, this does  not  mean  that  our  Parliament  is
lacking in terms of this responsibility. On the contrary, we have been  very
creative in  responding  to  this  challenge.  We  are  developing  our  own
oversight practise based on the particular circumstances in our country.

Having said this,  it  is  still  imperative  that  Parliament  develop  its
oversight role in a more formal  and  structured  manner.  This  has  become
particularly important in the light of the new base we are moving into  with
the  focus  increasingly  on  a  shift  away  from  policy  formulation  and
legislation to implementation.

A good starting point is  for  Parliament  to  begin  a  formal  process  of
evaluating  its  different  oversight  activities  as  distinct   from   its
legislative role and develop a manual on accountability  and  oversight  for
MPs and committees and to  continually  refine  it.  This  can  be  done  by
capturing  our  own  best  oversight  practises  and   the   experience   of
chairpersons. Such a manual will also facilitate  the  establishment  of  an
institutional memory which will benefit MPs in the future.

We cannot talk about developing the oversight  role  of  committees  without
having regard for the capacity of committees  to  exercise  their  oversight
function. In order  to  be  effective,  committees  need  to  be  adequately
resourced and capacitated. We are of the view that a  process  should  begin
which is aimed  at  building  Parliament's  oversight  capabilities  through
adequate resourcing and capacity-building  in  committees  and  constituency
offices within Parliament's administrative support structures.

A major concern which could hamper the effectiveness of committees in  their
oversight work is the  regular  turnover  of  staff  in  the  administrative
support structures, and in particular  in  the  committee  section  and  the
parliamentary research services section. It is of little use for  Parliament
to invest in the training of committee  staff  or  researchers  if  some  of
these staff members see their appointment to the committee  section  or  the
research units merely as  a  stepping  stone  to  employment  in  Government
departments.

Many times their departure leaves a huge void  which  ultimately  translates
into operational problems for some committees, which in turn  affects  their
capacity to exercise effective oversight. Continuity  in  the  parliamentary
research unit in particular is very important. Research is the lifeblood  of
committees in so far as oversight is concerned.  Without  in-depth  analysis
of  departmental  documents  and  reports,  committees  will  find  it  very
difficult to identify key issues which might need their intervention.

In conclusion, research should facilitate parliamentary access and  capacity
to acquire independently gathered information in order to  ensure  effective
oversight.  Currently  committees  are  largely  dependent  on   information
elicited from departments themselves. They  should  not  rely  on  a  single
information source given the variety of perspectives on and  the  complexity
of many issues and problems.

Ndza khensa. Loko ku  ri  na  timinete  leti  nga  sala  ndzi  ta  titirhisa

tomorrow. [Applause.]]

Mr N L MONARENG (Free State): Hon Chairperson, hon members of the NCOP,  hon
members from the provincial legislatures, comrades and friends, making  good
governance a living reality is what oversight seeks to develop,  and  as  it
deepens the culture and institutions  of  democracy,  the  concept  of  good
governance has come to be understood to cover a very broad  field.  Although
sometimes used interchangeably with democracy, good governance  goes  beyond
traditional conceptions of democracy, and  includes  social,  political  and
economic aspects.

Some of  the  key  elements  of  good  governance,  therefore,  include  the
observance of the rule of law, human rights, transparent  economic  and  co-
operative governance, as well as the active participation of  civil  society
and other nonstate actors in national affairs.

There are five dimensions which underpin  good  governance  and  sustainable
development.  These  are  political,  institutional,  economic,  social  and
gender. In this debate I  am  going  to  talk  about  these  dimensions  and
oversight as a tool to enhance good governance. The sense in which the  term
``good governance'' is commonly used is  in  a  political  dimension,  which
implies the existence of a multiparty system and  the  holding  of  periodic
elections. South Africa, since  1994,  has  been  holding  elections  in  an
atmosphere that has been judged to be generally free  and  fair.  I  believe
that a healthy political  opposition  with  media  freedom  is  a  necessary
balance against Government excess. A related  challenge  is  the  prevention
and management of conflict, which is  also  an  essential  prerequisite  for
good governance.

There is also a need to develop and strengthen democratic institutions  such
as the Office of the Ombudsman or  the  Public  Protector,  Parliament,  the
courts, civil society organisations, the Office of the  Auditor-General  and
human rights commissions. These are institutions  which  play  an  oversight
and  monitoring  role  over  the  executive,  to  ensure  transparency   and
accountability in the use of public resources as well as  to  guard  against
corruption. I am pleased to know that  in  South  Africa  such  institutions
have been established and Government is continuously consulting them in  the
process of decision-making and formulating policies.

Good political governance is of little use  if  it  is  not  accompanied  by
progress on the economic side. Although our  country  experienced  a  modest
level of growth in the past few years and it  is  continuing  to  grow,  the
major  challenges  confronting  us  are   the   high   level   of   poverty,
unemployment, a high budget deficit and a heavy dependence on the export  of
primary commodities.

The small size of the economies and markets of the SADC countries  makes  it
difficult to address the challenge of globalisation.  SADC  was  created  to
make it possible for member states to reap the ecstatic  and  dynamic  gains
of regional integration  in  order  to  foster  economic  growth,  eradicate
poverty, enhance the standard of living of the people  of  Southern  Africa,
support the disadvantaged and achieve a sustainable development pattern.

Linked to the economy is the social and human dimension of good  governance.
Good  governance  can  only  thrive  in  an  atmosphere  of  positive  human
development. Human development refers to the  development  that  results  in
enhancing the capacity of people to live long, healthy  lives,  and  acquire
relevant skills and knowledge that will enable  them  to  access  employment
and higher income, increase their productivity and raise  their  quality  of
life.

Good governance is ultimately about ensuring a  good,  happy  life  for  all
members of society. It requires, among other things, effective  and  capable
institutions that are able to exploit  the  advantage  of  collaboration  to
their benefit.
Measurements of human development have, of late, indicated a decline in  the
status of human life in the region of the  human  development  index,  which
contains measures of GDP, per capita life expectancy and adult literacy.  In
SADC, such regions declined by 5,3% between  1995  and  1998.  This  is  the
reason for the state of the economic and human condition prevailing  in  the
region which, in turn, is determined by forces internal and external to  the
region.

A major cause of decline in human  development  is  the  HIV/Aids  pandemic,
which has eroded some of the socioeconomic gains the region had made in  the
recent years. Some of our SADC member  states  have  the  highest  infection
rates in the world, and our region has been said to be the epicentre of  the
pandemic.

The few dimensions of good governance relate to the achievement of  equality
for women, the youth and the disabled. Equality between women, men  and  the
disabled has come to be recognised as a human right  and  a  democratic  and
economic imperative. Women in most  countries  continue  to  constitute  the
bulk of the poorest  households,  and  have  limited  access  to  productive
resources, power and decision-making, education and  training,  as  well  as
adequate health services.

International experience indicates that collective decisions made in a  more
participative,  egalitarian  and  democratic  manner  may  yet  fail  to  be
translated into action. Those who make the decisions may lack  the  capacity
to implement them. Reasons for failure to implement policies may  vary  from
capacity constraints to logistical issues. Ultimately,  these  failures  may
lead to the undermining of good governance and development.

This observation does not  argue  against  the  decisions  made  in  a  more
participative, egalitarian and democratic manner.  All  it  argues  is  that
good intentions alone are not enough. An element of entailing mechanisms  of
ongoing monitoring and  accountability  is  also  required.  This  is  where
oversight, a tool to enhance good  governance  and  development,  comes  in.
This oversight role has to be understood in  the  context  of  a  supportive
role in advancing and consolidating democracy.

Our legislatures assume the primary responsibility of fulfilling this  role.
This role is primarily executed by overseeing the  provincial  and  national
executives and the forging of links with the public.  Put  differently,  our
legislatures assume the responsibility of lawmaking  and  of  ensuring  that
those quality laws  are  implemented  efficiently  and  in  a  way  that  is
responsive to the needs of the people that we respect.

In conclusion, the oversight role of the legislature should not be  seen  in
abstract  or  be  viewed   outside   the   broader   project   of   national
transformation. Oversight has to be integrated  into  the  broader  goal  of
transformation, so that it meets its  intended  goal  of  being  a  tool  to
enhance good governance and development.

This integration is shown when legislatures  become  active  agents  in  the
constitutional project of transforming the country and  avoiding  the  ever-
present temptation of being too technical. Our legislatures should  be  able
to grapple with the challenge of developing new legislation in  crucial  and
critical policy areas that will translate into a better  life  for  all  our
people.

However, all these good  intentions  will  be  undermined  if  no  conscious
effort is made to nurture a truly deliberative style of decision-making  and
to strengthen the  link  between  the  people  that  we  represent  and  the
members. Nurturing of these areas will translate our institutions into  true
instruments and tools of good governance and development, that will  deliver
a better life for all. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the  first  issue  that  became  clear  from  the
discussions on oversight and accountability in the  committee,  is  that  we
need to develop a common understanding and acceptance of  both  the  concept
and the purpose of oversight and accountability. In so far  as  the  concept
of oversight and accountability is concerned, adopting a  semantic  approach
to try and distinguish the two concepts from each other yielded very  little
profit for the task we had at hand. To borrow the words of Christina  Murray
at  the  Idasa  workshop  on  the  topic,  and  I  quote,   "Oversight   and
accountability are two sides of the same coin."

In  discussing  oversight  and  accountability  in  the   context   of   our
Constitution, this formulation allows us to make a great deal  of  progress.
In this context, the reason for oversight is to empower Parliament  to  hold
the executive to account. The purpose of oversight and accountability is  to
give the electorate good government.

I make this statement not to  criticise  any  particular  government  and  I
point out that the issues are the same in other jurisdictions, as  is  clear
from the address of Mr Gregg Power of the Hansard society in the UK at  this
Idasa  workshop.  Put  another  way,  we  can   say   that   oversight   and
accountability  is  all  about  ensuring  delivery,  for  without  a  proper
understanding and use of oversight and accountability we will  not  be  able
to control and manage outputs and outcomes; that is, we will not be able  to
control financial accountability nor will we be  able  to  ensure  efficient
implementation of policy decisions. In this sense,  clearly,  oversight  and
accountability is a tool to enhance good governance and development.

At this stage of the debate we need to avoid clouding  the  issue.  We  must
concentrate  on  achieving  a  common  understanding   between   Government,
Parliament and the electorate  on  both  the  concept  and  the  purpose  of
oversight and accountability. I must also add that the obligation to  ensure
proper oversight and accountability does not fall  on  an  opposition  only.
Every  single  member  of  Parliament,   regardless   of   their   political
affiliation, must play his or  her  role  to  ensure  proper  oversight  and
accountability. If members of the governing party allow this to  become  the
exclusive  role  of  the  opposition  then  they  are   failing   in   their
constitutional obligations and have only themseves to blame for it.

I think it is self-evident that oversight and accountability is  a  tool  to
enhance  good  governance  and  development.  The  ad  hoc  joint  committee
considered the issues raised in Prof  Corder's  report  and  wrote  its  own
report  which   included   a   number   of   recommendations.   Except   for
recommendation 7, there was agreement on all of these  recommendations.  The
differences are perhaps more  properly  characterised  as  a  difference  in
approach rather than a fundamental difference on the issues.

The one approach says let's develop a manual of best practice  on  oversight
and accountability, and  at  some  later  stage  consider  formalising  this
document as an Act. The other approach says we should  have  an  Act  sooner
rather than later, and that this Act  should  set  out  the  mechanisms  for
conducting oversight and holding the Government to account.  This  Act  must
clarify  the  relationship  between  Ministers  and  directors-general   and
allocate responsibility between them. This Act must provide a framework  for
holding a Minister accountable to Parliament.

In my view, a mechanism to enforce  oversight  and  accountability  must  be
both  certain  and  enforceable,   otherwise   it   falls   short   of   the
constitutional requirement. The status of a best practice  manual  will,  at
best, be ambiguous. It  will  not  have  the  force  of  law  nor  even  the
procedural authority of the Rules  of  Parliament.  Those  that  favour  the
manual approach argue that, and I quote from a report:


  The argument that is proposed to effect that legal clout is  required  to
  ensure compliance, particularly in a realm of mandatory  accountabilities
  questioned on the basis that, unlike  other  constitutional  democracies,
  the oversight role of Parliament and the accountability  responsibilities
  are contained in the Constitution.

With respect to those who subscribe to this argument,  it  is  a  circuitous
argument, because the  Constitution  does  not  provide  the  mechanisms  to
ensure oversight and accountability and requires the  National  Assembly  to
put in place these very mechanisms. The best way to define  such  mechanisms
and give effect to them is  in  the  contemplated  Act.  Further,  those  in
favour  of  the  manual  approach  argue   in   respect   of   a   mandatory
accountability that Parliament can legislate to correct problems  that  come
to light with oversight. This approach  would  be  appropriate  for  general
problems, but is highly inappropriate for  correcting  maladministration  in
respect of an individual's situation.

Finally,  those  in  favour  of  the   manual   approach   argue   that   an
accountability standards Act would  compel  the  executive  to  comply  with
specific provisions or face judicial sanctions. However, in my view,  before
court  action  could  even  be  contemplated,  legislation  would  give  the
Presiding Officers clear and unambiguous guidelines of when and how  to  act
to give effect to oversight and enforce accountability. Therefore, it  would
only be in extreme cases that  it  would  be  necessary  to  resort  to  the
courts. By contrast, as already pointed out, the legal status of the  manual
will not be clear and will be difficult to enforce. [Applause.]
Mr T S SETONA: Hon Chairperson, hon members, allow me to  start  by  quoting
one of the legends of our continent, the late President of the ANC,  Comrade
Oliver Tambo, on the occasion of his response to the Koornhof Bill in  1982.
He had this to say:


  The key test of any democratic  parliament  is  its  ability  to  be  the
  verdict of our people.

I think  the  defining  phrase  here  is  "our  people"  and  all  preceding
speakers, Mr Lever, do agree that the key role of  Parliament  is  to  serve
our people, to oversee the extent to  which  our  executive  and  all  other
institutions of state are bettering the lives of our  people.  We  agree  on
that whole issue of development.

These are the same people who bestowed a democratic mandate on  the  ANC  on
27 April 1994 to lead this country into a united, nonracial, democratic  and
nonsexist  society.  Of  course,  through  a  very   thorough   process   of
consultation, the ANC, together with the broader  civil  society  and  other
stakeholders, developed a vision in terms of which we are to see how we  are
going to create this nonracial, democratic, nonsexist  and  united  society.
That vision has become what  we  call  the  Reconstruction  and  Development
Programme. I think that is the key task of our state.  Everything  that  all
our departments are doing is located within the context of  this  particular
socioeconomic framework.

So, unlike many  other  countries,  our  Constitution  clearly  outlines  in
succinct terms the role of institutions of governance  in  pursuit  of  good
governance and a better life for all our people. Amongst the core  functions
of legislatures in this  country  as  enunciated  in  our  Constitution  is,
firstly, oversight and accountability of the executive - I  think  Mr  Lever
is quite correct on this - and generally passing  legislation,  as  well  as
monitoring the impact of that legislation on the lives of our  people.  That
is exactly what it means, that the centrality of our work is our people.

However, we are rather hampered in this critical task  because  neither  our
Constitution nor our parliamentary rules define  in  exact  and  unambiguous
terms what is  meant  by  oversight  in  the  executive's  exercise  of  its
authority. I think that there is a critical loophole in that. We don't  have
benchmarks on the basis of which, as an institution, we are able  to  define
and measure the extent to which we are exercising  this  oversight  function
as legislators.

The lack of clarity and standard  has  at  times  presented  two  scenarios,
which I think other members have captured. One scenario is the one in  which
legislatures and parliamentary committees, in particular, become  uncritical
rubber  stamps  of  executive  decisions,  which  is  a   very   problematic
situation. It undermines that critical call by  Oliver  Tambo  which  places
our people at the centre stage of our work on a daily basis because, by  and
large, the executive's primary mandate is to ensure that we  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty which afflicts millions of people of this  country.  So
I think we really have to grapple  with  that  particular  challenge  as  we
finally consider the report that Mr Lever has alluded to.

The other critical weakness which arises  at  times  is  when  oversight  is
understood by legislatures as merely having to play  a  watchdog  role.  The
opposition,  and  at  times  even  members  of  the  ruling  party,  without
considering the oversight that Government is doing,  would  oppose  for  the
sake of opposing without critically researching  and  knowing  exactly  what
obtained on the ground, and how situations are impacting  on  the  lives  of
the people.

We welcome the effort by Parliament to commission a report on oversight  and
accountability. The report that we will debate today will go a long  way  in
clarifying  and  defining  our   approach   on   this   matter.   In   other
jurisdictions, like India and the USA, oversight functions  of  legislatures
over the executive are clearly articulated with clear  standards  which  are
applied to monitor activities and functions of their governments.  Mr  Lever
has alluded to this thing as captured in our report.

However, we must acknowledge that South  Africa  is  unique,  with  its  own
developmental challenges. Over the last nine years we  have  gradually  been
redefining and developing our own unique model of  oversight  based  on  the
peculiarities of our own situation and our experience.  I  will  attempt  to
highlight the evolution of our oversight  with  specific  reference  to  the
NCOP, covering the following critical areas: firstly, legislative  scrutiny.
I think our major test in terms of scrutinising legislation, we  all  agree,
has not been informed  by  anything  else  but  the  extent  to  which  that
legislation has been compliant with the Constitution  of  our  country,  the
whole issue of human rights and how it is going to impact on  the  lives  of
our people. The second issue is about  socioeconomic  development.  We  have
been  doing  that  to  check  how  this  legislation  is   going   to   have
socioeconomic implications on our people and co-operative governance.

In locating oversight as a tool to enhance  governance  and  development  in
the role of the NCOP, we must first define the role of the NCOP as  distinct
and complementary to other legislatures. Over a period of time we have  come
to converge on the understanding of the NCOP as a  forum  that  joins  three
spheres of government into a platform for discussions of issues of  national
importance.  Proceeding  from  this  understanding  the  NCOP,  through  its
systems and practices, has evolved processes that bring the voices of  local
and  provincial  government  into  the  national  legislative  policy-making
processes.

The briefing of provinces by various select committees and local  government
and the subsequent deriving of a mandate by  various  select  committees  is
one of the rich experiences  we  can  talk  about  which  has  enhanced  the
capacity of the NCOP to provide scrutiny on the issue  of  legislation.  The
NCOP has also adopted systems like provincial weeks which has, in the  main,
to empower us to monitor policies  and  legislation  in  relation  to  their
effectiveness not only on the lives of our people but, more importantly,  to
the stated goals and aims as agreed to by the executive.  In  that  respect,
we have been able to advise the executive  on  the  legislation  and  policy
gaps, which have been amended to a large extent, thus  improving  the  lives
of our people.

Added to the programmes of provincial weeks  we  must  actually  extend  our
gratitude to the Presiding Officers of our institution for  coming  up  with
an innovative practice and programme of taking  Parliament  to  the  people.
Inasmuch as we acknowledge that this particular aspect is  also  central  to
our Constitution, there is no legislature  other  than  the  NCOP  that  has
begun this programme of taking Parliament to the  people  in  more  concrete
and practical terms.

This programme was not just  a  mere  public  relations  exercise,  but  has
enabled members of Parliament to interact with our people, to listen to  the
concerns of our people and also to provide the NCOP with  a  report-back  by
way of raising issues with various government departments, in terms  of  the
experiences of people on the ground. We  think  that  is  one  of  the  most
innovative ways  in  which  the  NCOP  displayed  creativity  in  exercising
oversight.

One must also allude to the fact that, unlike in previous years,  provincial
weeks in the NCOP are nowadays more  focused.  In  previous  times  we  were
focusing on  issues  of  economic  development  and  infrastructure  in  our
various nodal points. For the first time we have been able, not only in  the
case of a particular select committee but  as  the  entire  institution,  to
have a sense of the developments and the  challenges  that  are  facing  our
Government in terms of delivering in relation to these  particular  critical
aspects. That has been a success.

However, we cannot only continue to talk about the the rosy things  that  we
have done. I think we are  also  confronted  with  challenges.  One  of  the
critical  challenges  is  to  ensure  consistent  linkage   between   select
committees in the NCOP with the mandate and the work of  the  committees  in
the legislature. I think there is a critical  weakness  around  that.  Every
time we commence a sitting we stand up and  pass  motions.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Deputy Chair  and  hon  members,  the  old
saying ``when the going gets tough, the tough get going'' is often  true  in
real life, and no less so in the business of Government.

If we look at the  example  of  the  private  sector,  the  best  government
corporations are those that by  definition  survive  the  market  test.  The
public sector is unique in that  it  comprises  both  an  elected  political
overseer and a nonelected, nonpolitical executive. At best these  two  exist
in a state of creative tension, challenging  and  inspiring  each  other  to
achieve good governance. However, tough times put  pressure  on  governments
because they inevitably have to deliver their best possible  performance  at
exactly the time when the fewest  resources  are  available.  This  is  when
government survives or fails the market test.

And this is why, in terms of the crucial  role  that  legislatures  play  in
monitoring and reviewing the actions of the executive organs of  government,
oversight is one of the most essential tools to enhance good governance  and
development and must be at its sharpest under the most extreme conditions.

I think one must understand the meaning  of  two  very  important  concepts,
namely the  meaning  of  oversight  and  that  of  accountability.  In  this
instance  the  intended  sense  of  overseeing  means  that  we  follow  its
trajectory from its time of inception through  to  fulfilment,  even  though
this may not  always  be  the  case,  given  the  long-term  nature  of  the
governmental process. We continually strive for the best possible.

Our task of overseeing the executive is governed  by  statute  and  its  end
product must be accountable governance in every  conceivable  sense  of  the
word.

Maar wat is goeie regering? Die begrip "regering" is so oud as die  mens  en
sy beskawing. Kortweg gestel, is dit beide die proses van  besluitneming  en
die proses waardeur besluite geïmplementeer word.

Die regering is slegs een van die akteurs.  Ander  akteurs  kan  wissel  van
invloedryke  vakbonde  tot  klein,  maar  steeds  invloedryke  nie-regerings
organisasies, finansiële instellings, geestelike leiers,  politieke  partye,
die weermag, navorsingsinstitute en so meer. Op nasionale vlak kan  'n  mens
die media, wandelgang  rolspelers,  georganiseerde  misdaad,  internasionale
donateurs en multi-nasionale korporasies byvoeg. Almal  het  'n  rol  om  te
speel in die besluitneming of beïnvloeding van besluite.

Die uitdaging wat 'n goeie regering moet erken vir  werk  en  uitbou  is  om
selfs in die moeilikste tye die morele leiding te neem wat  die  respek  van
die meeste bogenoemde rolspelers sal afdwing. Daar moet nie  toegelaat  word
dat 'n regering se beste  programme  in  moeilike  tye  die  eerste  is  wat
sneuwel nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But what is good governance? The concept of governing is as old as  mankind
and civilisation itself. In a nutshell, it is both the process of  decision-
making and the process by means of which decisions are implemented.

The government is only one  of  the  actors.  Other  actors  can  vary  from
influential trade unions to small, but  still  influential  non-governmental
organisations,  financial   institutions,   spiritual   leaders,   political
parties, the defence force, research  institutions,  etc.  At  the  national
level one  can  add  the  media,  corridor  role-players,  organised  crime,
international donors and multinational corporations. Everybody  has  a  role
to play in decision-making or influencing the decision-making.

The challenge which a good  government  must  acknowledge  for  working  and
developing is, even in the toughest of times, to give moral  guidance  which
will demand respect  from  most  of  the  above-mentioned  role-players.  It
should not be allowed that a government's best programmes are the  first  to
fall in trying times.]

That is exactly when the tough must get going.
Dit is juis die tyd dat ons moet sorg dat die beste elemente oorleef.  Suid-
Afrika se etiese infrastruktuur is stadig-aan besig  om  te  ontwikkel,  ten
spyte  van  negatiewe  invloede   van   korrupsie,   omkopery,   uitbuiting,
geldwassery en sommige hoogs twyfelagtige internasionale beleggings  wat  op
beide  die  psigiese  en  fisiese  terrein  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  samelewing
beïnvloed. Ons is almal bewus van die korrupsie en bedrog wat  in  ons  land
hoogty vier. So die vraag is, wat moet gedoen word om hierdie virus te  keer
sodat dit nie die hele waardeketting ontgogel en selfs ineen kan laat  stort
nie?

Dis tyd vir 'n beproefde verdedigingsmeganisme en die oplossing is glad  nie
vergesog nie. Tye is moeilik, maar dis juis nou  die  beste  klimaat  om  te
verseker dat mense wat dit verdien uitgelig, in die  hof  gedagvaar,  en  in
die openbaar vervolg word. Die spreukwoord sê, ``sagte hande maak  stinkende
wonde''. As ons deur ons optrede of nalatigheid toegelaat het  dat  korrupte
invloede insluip, moet ons die pyn kan vat.  Daarom  sê  ek  'n  proaktiewe,
buigbare, defensiewe,  vooruitdenkende  strategie  wat  deur  almal  aanvaar
word, wat 'n maatskaplike verantwoordelikheid  vir  die  medemens  dwarsdeur
die Suid-Afrikaanse milieu sal skep, is 'n prioriteit.

Indien die King-verslag van 1994 suksesvol gegenereer kan  word,  sal  Suid-
Afrika ten opsigte van skoon regering met die  beste  regerings  ter  wêreld
kan meeding. Hopelik  sal  dit  meebring  dat  meer  groot  spelers  op  ons
effektebeurs sal  aanbly  en  dat  bona  fide  internasionale  beleggers  'n
aansienlike verbetering in die huidige situasie sal teweegbring.

Ons  parastatale  entiteite  behoort  dan  aantreklik  genoeg  teikens   vir
privatisering te wees, maar dit hang daarvan af dat die persepsie dat  hulle
relatief vry van korrupsie en nepotisme is, herstel en  uitgebou  word.  Die
uitvoerende gesagstrukture,  oor  wie  ons  toesig  moet  hou,  het  in  die
afgelope jare geweldige veranderinge ondergaan. In  die  Wes-Kaap  provinsie
bestaan daar nou byvoorbeeld  een  munisipaliteit  vir  elke  drie  van  die
verlede. Al die nuwe rolspelers moet 'n kans gegun word om te  ontwikkel  en
dié wat nie die mas opkom nie, van hulle moet ontslae geraak word.
Dit is ook een van ons belangrikste oorsigrolle: Om te sorg  dat  die  mense
nie immoreel vet salaristjeks, wat hulle moontlik nie verdien  het  nie,  in
die bank betaal terwyl ons jong dokters, ons verpleegsters,  ons  opvoeders,
ons polisie en ander harde werkers harde bene kou. Ek dank  u.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[This is precisely the time when we should ensure  that  the  best  elements
survive.  South  Africa's  ethical  infrastructure  is  slowly   developing,
despite negative influences of  corruption,  bribery,  exploitation,  money-
laundering  and  some  highly  doubtful   international   investments   that
influence South African society both on the psychological  as  well  as  the
physical terrain. We  are  all  aware  of  the  corruption  and  fraud  that
currently reign supreme in our country. So the question  is,  what  must  be
done to stop this virus so that it does  not  disillusion  the  whole  value
chain or even cause it to collapse?

It is time for proven defence mechanisms and the  solution  is  not  in  the
least far-fetched. Times are tough, but that is precisely  why  now  is  the
best climate to ensure that people who deserve it are singled  out,  brought
before a court of law and publicly prosecuted. The proverb says  ``you  have
to be cruel to be kind''. If  we,  by  our  actions  or  omissions,  allowed
corrupt influences to creep in, we must be able to pay the  price.  That  is
why I say a proactive, flexible, defensive,  pre-emptive  strategy  that  is
accepted by everyone, which will create a social responsibility  for  fellow
human beings throughout the South African milieu, is a priority.

If the King Report of 1994 could be  successfully  generated,  South  Africa
would be able to compete with the best governments in the world  as  far  as
clean governance is concerned. Hopefully this will have as result that  more
big players  will  stay  on  at  our  stock  exchange  and  that  bona  fide
international investors will bring about a considerable improvement  in  the
present situation.

Our parastatal  entities  should  then  be  attractive  enough  targets  for
privatisation, but this  depends  on  the  perception  that  they  could  be
restored and expanded relatively free  from  corruption  and  nepotism.  The
executive authority structures,  that  we  must  oversee,  in  recent  years
underwent tremendous changes. For example, in the Western  Cape  at  present
there is one municipality for every three of the past.  All  the  new  role-
players must be given a chance to develop and  those  that  cannot  make  it
must be got rid of.

This is also one of the most  important  oversight  roles:  To  ensure  that
people do not bank immorally fat salary cheques,  which  they  probably  did
not earn, while our young doctors, our nurses,  our  educators,  our  police
and other hard workers are struggling to make ends meet. I thank you.]

Ms N D  NTWANAMBI:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Deputy  Chairperson,  special
delegates and members of this House, we must not adopt a simplistic view  of
governance. Governance is not only about things Government must do  such  as
having regular elections, effective administration and  securing  peace  and
security.
Governance, moreover, means that the Government must do things in ways  that
allow  people  to  believe  that  they  have  a  stake  in  Government   and
governance. Governance is not only about representivity and legitimacy,  or,
like Mrs Versfeld, asking questions  about  fishing  only.  [Interjections.]
These are essential, but governance is most importantly about accounting  to
the citizens.

While governance is about exercising political power, the  need  to  account
to citizens is indispensable. The point to be made here is that politics  is
as important to successful development  as  economics.  For  far  too  long,
governance was viewed only in terms of economic progress and  administrative
efficiency, as if these were the only components of good governance.

Good  governance   requires   the   establishment   and   strengthening   of
institutions which are able to hold the executive and  powerful  individuals
to  account.  With  these  introductory  remarks,  I  now  wish  to  discuss
oversight.
There are many dimensions to the subject of oversight as a tool  to  enhance
good  governance  and  development.  Firstly,  there  is   the   ideological
imperative.  We  as  elected  representatives  could  raise  the   following
questions when exercising our oversight responsibilities.  For  example,  we
should  continuously  raise  the  question:  To  what  extent  do  resources
distributed by a government, whether national, provincial or local,  reflect
the policy decision taken by the democratic forces?

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Like fishing!

Ms  N  D  NTWANAMBI:  The  school  feeding  scheme  remains  our  passionate
interest; our children, Mrs Versfeld, not the sea children!  Our  Government
is very clear about one thing: Our children must not go  to  school  hungry.
[Interjections.] While the integrated nutrition programme may not have  been
as successful as we would like it to be, it remains our  cherished  project,
and it is consistent with our transformation agenda. It's  not  about  those
who don't come to the House, like Krumbock. [Interjections.]
Policy intervention by national Government is consistent with objectives  of
the democratic forces. [Interjections.] A key function of  our  presence  in
the national Parliament is to exercise oversight over the executive.  Whilst
oversight is not limited to endorsing or authorising national or  provincial
executives' expenditure and  revenue  proposals,  the  oversight  role  also
relates  to  ensuring  that  national   and   provincial   departments   and
governments meet their performance standards.

A budget is simply a planning tool. To determine whether it is good  or  bad
depends on the extent to which it addresses our objectives. The  progressing
outcomes of our policy intervention,  whether  by  national,  provincial  or
local government, are the test  of  our  achievements.  National  Government
has, for example, increased access to basic education. More children  attend
schools today than under the previous regime.

The extension  of  the  social  safety  net  is  one  of  the  postapartheid
Government's greatest achievements. It has seen the number of  social  grant
beneficiaries increase from 2,5 million in  April  1997  to  5,6 million  in
March this year. The value of grants has also increased over this period.

Besides being transparent, our Government has democratically  developed  and
pursues a legislative agenda, which is commensurate with the  objectives  of
progressive  forces  supporting  transformation   in   this   country.   The
progressive outcome and contents of our legislation,  in  essence,  are  the
real tests of the  outcomes  of  the  Government.  National  Government  has
implemented policy choices in a manner that  makes  it  accountable  to  the
people we serve.

The oversight role has another dimension and this relates  to  our  role  as
members of the NCOP, a House that has provincial interest as the  foundation
of its activities. The main  brief  of  NCOP  members  and  members  of  the
provincial legislatures is  to  collectively  exercise  oversight  over  the
provincial budgets. In this regard it becomes  crucial  to  raise  pertinent
questions  in  this  House  and  the  provincial   legislatures   on   their
expenditure patterns.

Members of Parliament and citizens of this country must play a  more  active
and vital role in monitoring spending  by  all  spheres  of  government.  If
discrepancies exist in financial reporting, it is likely that  discrepancies
will be revealed  on  delivery  as  well.  Moreover,  MPs  and  MPLs  should
exercise extraordinary vigilance in order to monitor the  spending  patterns
of conditional grants to provincial departments.

The public, for example,  could  raise  the  following  questions:  To  what
extent do the Budget and resources it allocates  adequately  reflect  policy
decisions taken by the province or the national  Government  of  the  entire
country? To what extent do financial inputs produce the desired outputs  and
outcomes? We need to distinguish between the outputs and the outcomes.

Assuming that a workshop on immunisation against TB is held, the  output  of
this workshop would be a conference to report the outcome  of  the  workshop
and the increase, if any, in the rate of immunisation and the reduction,  if
any, in the rate of TB incidence.

Has there been an increase in the number of beneficiaries of social  grants,
for example, between 1995 and this year? What proportion of  total  revenues
comprises own revenue for provinces and municipalities?  Are  provinces  and
local  governments  collecting  and  spending   revenues   effectively   and
efficiently? Are any provinces contemplating  instituting  provincial  taxes
in terms of the  Provincial  Tax  Regulation  Process  Act?  Have  provinces
allocated an additional amount for contingency  reserves?  How  will  it  be
utilised in the new financial year? These are just  some  of  the  questions
elected representatives and members of the public could raise. I  hope  I've
managed to alert you to some of the pertinent issues and  challenges  facing
public finances and our finance oversight.

Lastly, I wish to say I hope I heard "Good!" more  often  than  "Bad!"  from
the member behind me. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order, Mrs  Ntwanambi,
order. [Laughter.] You've said what  you've  said.  Now  I  can  see  you're
picking a fight between the two of you. [Laughter.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson:


  It is in the legislatures that the instruments  have  been  fashioned  to
  create a better life for all. It is here that oversight of government has
  been exercised. It is here that our society in all its formations has had
  an opportunity to influence policy and its implementation.

These were the words of former President Nelson Mandela in 1999.

Alhoewel ons  parlementêre  sisteem  die  konsep  van  partyregering  en  'n
kabinet verantwoordelik aan die wetgewer behou het,  voorsien  ons  Grondwet
'n  baie  sterker  en  belangriker  rol  vir  Suid-Afrikaanse  wetgewers  as
wetgewers in tipiese  Westminster-sisteme.  Wetgewers  in  die  Westminster-
tradisie slaag nie  goed  daarin  om  in  dié  tydperke  tussen  verkiesings
regerings verantwoordbaar te hou nie. In sulke sisteme  word  die  taak  van
oorsig normaalweg aan die opposisie oorgelaat, wat net  fokus  op  die  swak
punte van die regering in hulle pogings om daardie regering te  diskrediteer
en te probeer vervang. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Although our parliamentary system retained the concept of party  government
and a cabinet responsible to the legislature, our  Constitution  provides  a
much stronger and more important role to  South  African  legislatures  than
those in typically Westminster  systems.  Legislatures  in  the  Westminster
tradition do not succeed well in  holding  governments  accountable  in  the
periods between  elections.  In  such  systems  the  task  of  oversight  is
normally left to the opposition, who only focus on the weak  points  of  the
government in their  efforts  to  discredit  and  attempt  to  replace  that
government.]

We have also seen this perspective in our country in the  DA's  attitude  of
"what is  bad  for  the  country  is  good  for  the  DA".  [Interjections.]
Accountability and oversight are crucial aspects of the representative  role
of legislatures which should not be left to opposition parties only.  It  is
much too important for that. I'm glad Mr Lever seems  to  agree  with  this.
[Interjections.]

The need for all members of Parliament to actively  fulfil  their  oversight
function is all the more acute when one party is dominant,  and  regular  or
frequent change of Government is highly unlikely.  I'm  glad  that  in  this
House members of the majority party have, clearly,  started  to  take  their
oversight role very seriously. This shows, for example, from the  number  of
questions being asked by members of the majority party and, may I  add,  the
quality of those questions. [Interjections.]

It is important to show the voters that they  do  not  have  to  support  an
opposition party which has a confrontational, negative, fight-back  approach
to politics to ensure good and clean government. [Interjections.]  With  the
DA's  style  this  will  even  be  counterproductive  to  their   interests.
[Interjections.] The public representatives belonging to  the  ANC  and  the
New NP are, as they should be, in any event already doing a much better  job
of oversight and keeping the executive accountable than the members  of  the
DA. [Interjections.]

There are different tools and  practices  that  can  and  must  be  used  by
members for a legislature to fulfil its constitutional  obligation  to  hold
the executive properly accountable. Oversight practices  must,  however,  be
thoroughly  integrated  in  all  its   work.   The   whole   political   and
administrative  environment   must   support   good   oversight   practices.
Committees  and  plenary  sessions  should  complement  each  other  in  the
oversight process.

In addition, certain key  practices  should  drive  the  oversight  process.
These  are  question   time,   motions,   special   plenary   debates,   the
consideration of  committee  reports  in  the  plenary,  the  annual  budget
process and scrutiny of departmental reports.

Provinces need  to  consider  how  to  use  question  time  in  this  House.
Provincial legislatures can and should request their permanent delegates  to
ask specific questions on their behalf to  the  Ministers  at  the  national
level.  Provinces  can  and  should  of  course  also  use  their  permanent
delegates to propose motions on their behalf. When it is  in  respect  of  a
matter for which there is unanimous support in this  House,  such  a  motion
can become a resolution of this House, which will  carry  much  weight  with
the executive. In cases of such resolutions also containing a  request,  the
executive has, as far as I know, always acceded to such  request  from  this
House.

The provinces should also be able to  ascertain  where  there  are  problems
with the implementation of certain aspects of national  Acts  of  Parliament
in  the  province.  In  such  an  instance,  or  when  they  find  that  new
legislative  initiatives  are   required   to   enhance   good   governance,
development and better delivery of services, they  can  and  should  request
one of their delegates to this House to submit  a  legislative  proposal  in
this House.

I conclude with the remarks of President Mbeki in his address to this  House
in 1999 on this topic, when he said:


  We are certain that if our elected representatives, in all the spheres of
  governance, maintain close contact with the people, they will  themselves
  contribute significantly to the achievement of the national objective  of
  accelerating the improvement of the quality of life  of  the  people,  by
  properly  discharging  their  oversight  function  over   the   executive
  authorities in all spheres of government.

I thank you. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members,
before I call the next speaker, I wish to make a ruling.  I  would  like  to
make a ruling on the objection that was raised by the  hon  Mr  Van  Niekerk
that the motion by the hon Mrs Vilakazi  is  sub  judice.  This  motion  was
moved on 3 June 2003.

The motion moved by Mrs Vilakazi is sub judice for  the  following  reasons:
Firstly, some of the allegations contained in the  motion  are  still  under
investigation; secondly, some of these cases mentioned  in  the  motion  are
still before the courts and have not been finalised.

May I mention that even though, as politicians, we have a  duty  to  address
issues on behalf of our constituencies, if motions  put  in  the  House  may
have an influence on the due administration of justice, such motions  should
be disallowed. Therefore the motion is disallowed. I thank you.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy  Chairperson,  we  can  say  that  our
democracy has now matured when a member of the opposition starts his  speech
with a quotation by our former President and concludes his  address  with  a
statement by our current President. We welcome this  development,  and  it's
an initiative which says that  as  a  nation  we  are  going  in  the  right
direction.

I think it is important to express our gratitude to members Mr Monareng  and
Mr Gelderblom for specifically coming to this Chamber to  debate  this  very
important area. We  must,  at  the  same  time,  also  express  our  sincere
gratitude for the very creative and incisive suggestion by  the  Chairperson
of the National Council of  Provinces  that  the  aspect  of  accountability
should include the element of good governance and  development.  Perhaps  by
the inclusion of these two elements we would be better  able  to  understand
or demystify this somewhat difficult concept of oversight.

In  trying  to  unpack  or  demystify  the  concept,  I  certainly  am   not
endeavouring to oversimplify but, rather, to say, as other  speakers  before
me  have  said,  that  the  basis  of  oversight  has  to  derive  from  the
Constitution. In terms of the Constitution, we have to start  off  with  the
basis of the underlying values that are set out  in  the  Constitution,  and
they are, as I've said previously, the affirmation  of  human  dignity,  and
the achievement of equality and freedom.

The Constitution also deals with the separation of powers,  referred  to  by
Mr  Setona.  The  tension  that  exists  between  the  executive   and   the
legislature, as a result of this particular separation, must be  understood.
The Constitution also reflects on the nature of co-operative  governance  in
that it should not be acrimonious, but  move  towards  resolving  issues  of
dispute and that it is  committed  to  achieving  a  national  unity  and  a
national  identity.  That  is  the  framework  within  which  it  should  be
understood.

The Constitution also says - other  than  referring  to  Parliament  or  the
executive and to all components  of  Government  as  being  accountable  and
endowing the responsibility on Parliament to oversee  the  activity  of  the
executive - that it should be responsive.

If the Constitution is, in fact, the soul of the  nation  and  reflects  the
aspirations of the nation, it is  our  duty  as  public  representatives  to
ensure that in its  commitment  the  executive,  through  its  policies  and
through the laws that it initiates in this Parliament,  ensures  that  there
is, in fact, an achievement of equality and that the laws reflect  the  kind
of framework or the dispensation that has been set out in our Constitution.

Certainly, the starting point has to be  the  Bill  of  Rights.  Other  than
guaranteeing civil liberties, it also reflects on the  socioeconomic  rights
of our people.  We  should  constantly  ask  ourselves,  and  confront  this
question: Is the legislation consistent with the supreme law of  this  land,
the Constitution? The Constitution has a  Bill  of  Rights,  which  includes
socioeconomic rights and which, in fact, reflects a need of this country  to
push back the frontiers of poverty and to change the quality  of  the  lives
of our people.
Having understood that framework, one then tries to unpack  the  legislative
role in the context of the National Assembly. It  says  quite  categorically
and specifically that it should oversee  the  work  of  the  executive,  its
decisions and its laws, and it should also be accountable.

In terms of the NCOP, other than referring  to  a  very  important  area  in
terms of the separation of powers,  Mr  Setona,  it  therefore  specifically
enjoins this Council to look  closely  at  section  100,  which  deals  with
intervention by national Government into provincial government; and  section
139, which  looks  at  intervention  of  provincial  government  into  local
government, to say that there should not be encroachment  on  the  integrity
of different spheres of government. That is its specific responsibility.

But, then, it also  provides  us  with  an  inherent  responsibility,  which
allows us to call the executive to account in this  particular  House,   and
that must be understood.

Now,  that  is  the  one  element.  The  other  element  is  obviously   the
legislative element, the responsibility of ensuring  that  there  is  proper
and  adequate  legislative  scrutiny.  That  is  an  important  element   of
oversight, and we should do our job as  legislators  correctly,  whether  we
are in the national Parliament or in our provincial legislature.

Another element is to ask whether in what we do, we are  in  fact  fostering
co-operative governance. Are we ensuring that the  kind  of  laws  that  are
being passed, or the policies that emanate from  the  executive,  which  the
Constitution says quite categorically derive from the executive,  are  being
shaped and refined in a  way  that  is  suitable  and  consistent  with  the
objectives of the Constitution?

Do these laws reflect the  kind  of  co-operative  nature  set  out  in  our
Constitution? The purpose, therefore, in  terms  of  our  oversight,  is  to
ensure that we have uniformity  and  a  cohesive  Government  aimed  at  the
achievement of national unity and a national identity of  all  our  peoples.
We should also look carefully at our Chapter 9  institutions  which,  again,
support  the  role  of  oversight.  They   are   independent   institutions,
independent of Parliament, which play a particular  role  in  ensuring  that
these objectives of nonracialism  and  nonsexism,  alluded  to  by  the  hon
Setona, are in fact dealt with.

What the Chairperson has done by  introducing  these  two  elements  is  two
things: it  has  separated  process,  in  terms  of  good  governance,  from
substance  in  terms  of  delivery.  I  think  development  is  attached  to
delivery; process did not develop into good governance.

As parliamentarians, to have good governance it has to  be  transparent,  it
has to be participatory, it has to be people-centred and  people-driven.  We
should  constantly  ask  ourselves:  Are  the  laws  and  policies  of  this
Government being disseminated to the public? Are they  participating  in  an
active and meaningful way? That is good governance. Whatever is being  done,
is it being done transparently? To what extent  are  we  engaging  with  it?
And, in terms of development, are we ensuring that these policies and  these
laws have an adequate impact on transforming the lives of our  people?  That
is the sociopolitical aspect that was referred to by Comrade Monareng  which
is very critical in terms of our  oversight  role.  I  think  that  must  be
understood.

Then, in terms of the tools at  our  disposal  -  Chairperson,  I'm  rushing
because it is late, and I have limited time - we have  public  hearings,  we
have questions, we have motions, we have subjects for  discussion,  we  have
plenaries. We have budgets which get analysed -  that  was  referred  to  by
Comrade Ntwanambi  -  which  is  a  very  important  instrument  to  measure
oversight, to measure implementation, to measure development. Unless we  use
these tools in a meaningful way, we are not  going  to  achieve  the  actual
role.

In rounding off, I  should  say  that  we  should  also  look  carefully  at
committees. Committees are transparent. They allow people - the public -  to
participate. All sectors of  the  public  may  participate,  such  as  civil
society, NGOs, transnational organisations. Whoever has an interest  in  any
law or any policy is entitled to participate in a  transparent  way  in  our
committees. Therefore they, too, become tools of oversight.

In terms of the position taken by Mr Lever - and I am raising a  point  that
he reflected on - before we look at  statutory  obligations,  we  must  ask:
What tools are at our disposal? There is the Public Finance  Management  Act
and the Municipal Finance Management Act which we are going to have now,  as
well as various guidelines  to  which  the  executive  is  bound.  Are  they
adequate in terms of fulfilling our role of  oversight  and  accountability?
If they are indeed, perhaps a guideline would be appropriate.

Has the executive been guilty of holding this House, or the other  House  of
Parliament, in contempt? Has it been accountable? Has  it  been  responsive?
To my mind, the answer has to be in the affirmative. The executive  has  not
interfered in the other sphere of government. It has not interfered  in  the
judiciary. It has respected the rules.

Therefore a guideline at this stage would be more appropriate. If there  are
challenges from the executive in terms of the integrity of Parliament, as  a
separate sphere, a separate  leg  of  Government,  then,  certainly,  it  is
something that we have to look at.

So, perhaps, to end, I would like  to  say  that  there  will  always  be  a
creative  tension  between  the  executive  and  the  legislature.  But  the
legislature must always understand that its  role  is  to  ensure  that  the
underlying values of the Constitution, the commitment of policies which  are
determined to change the quality of life of our people and to push back  the
frontiers of poverty, are in  fact  fulfilled  through  those  policies  and
through this legislation.

In doing so, we will fulfil our roles as public representatives. Perhaps  an
element which we tend to ignore is the last leg of our oversight,  and  that
is in our constituencies.  Inasmuch  as  the  executive  is  accountable  to
Parliament, we are accountable to the  public.  And  until  we  fulfil  that
particular  role  and  relate   with   our   constituencies,   through   our
constituency offices, we are not adequately fulfilling our oversight role.

So I hope I  have  assisted  in  demystifying  what  has  been  raised  very
creatively by the members. I would also like to say thank you to  Mrs  Nkuna
and members of the committee who have done extremely well in providing  this
Parliament with a very comprehensive  and  structured  report  in  terms  of
oversight and accountability. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.
