                               (Announcement)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members,
I've been informed that there won't be any motions from members today.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL
                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 2 - Parliament

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you, Deputy  Chairperson.  If  you  would
allow me, I would like to begin by welcoming the  Deputy  President  to  the
National Council of Provinces. It is indeed a great honour to have you  here
again. Deputy President, I am most pleased that you  will  be  participating
in our debate on the Budget Vote of Parliament. In fact, I know that all  of
us  are  looking  forward  to  hearing  your  thoughts  about   Parliament's
interaction with the executive and the  degree  to  which  we  are  carrying
through our work as we seek to build democracy in our country.

I think one of the features of our Parliament that sets us apart  from  many
parliaments of the world, and certainly of our continent, is the  fact  that
we are, as a parliament, in the  fortunate  position  of  having  our  role,
powers and functions very clearly set out in our Constitution and  therefore
we enjoy very firm constitutional protection. This is not a feature of  many
of the parliaments  that  operate  on  our  continent,  and  certainly  some
parliaments in other parts of the world.

Our Constitution further makes  provision  for  our  Parliament  to  be  the
primary democratic institution in South Africa. Our people have a  voice  in
our Parliament; not only through their elected representatives, as  in  many
other parliaments, but also through access  to  the  deliberations  of  this
Houses as well as through their right to speak and make  representations  in
our committees. This public participation assists in  our  primary  function
as the true representatives of the people.  We  shape  laws,  we  amend  the
Constitution, and we monitor, evaluate and encourage the executive  to  give
attention to issues of concern to the people of our country.

In my view, one of the most important roles we are assigned is the  role  of
national Budget Review - a process that is part of our  work  for  at  least
three months of every year. Perhaps we should be doing more, but we do  have
that concentrated time wherein we review the Budget.

We have, as a parliament, begun to change the way we look  at  the  national
Budget, primarily through the creation of the Joint  Budget  Committee.  Its
formal establishment last year has raised a number of  issues.  Firstly,  it
is our hope that in time, this committee will be a  seedling  from  which  a
professional budget analysis research unit will grow to provide  information
that enables us to have a thorough, independent  assessment  of  our  Budget
figures as a parliament.

Secondly, it is our intention, as has  already  been  agreed  by  the  Joint
Rules Committee, to make progress towards defining  Parliament's  powers  to
amend the Budget so as to  fulfil  the  demands  of  section  77(2)  of  the
Constitution, which allows us to pass legislation determining the  procedure
to be followed to amend money Bills. This issue sparked much  heated  debate
about five years ago, when an initial  draft  of  a  Money  Bills  Amendment
Procedure Bill was found unsuitable in that it  did  not  have  the  salient
features which would carry through the spirit of section 77(2).

The  reason  for  the  delay  in  making  further  progress  is   that   the
redefinition  of  these  amendment  powers,  obviously,   raises   important
political questions about the  role  of  Parliament  in  policy-making.  The
general feeling that's begun to emerge is that amendment powers, such as  we
may define in the appropriate legislation, should not be unconditional.  And
it is important, through the Budget Committee, that  we  actually  encourage
more work in this area and ensure that we  have  legislation  that  supports
both the role mandated to us as Parliament, as  well  as  the  policy-making
function and jurisdiction given to the executive.

Thirdly, it is our view that perhaps we do not  spend  enough  time  on  the
Budget in committees, in order to make a meaningful parliamentary input.  As
committees, perhaps we should have more time to consider the Budget than  is
currently allowed in our procedures. It  is  vital  for  our  Parliament  to
remain true to the very massive trust that our  people  have  given  to  us.
This trust requires us to  ensure  scrupulously  at  every  point,  that  we
engage in our work with certainty of purpose and  clarity  on  approach  and
process.

We are now as a parliament, I think, in a  far  better  position  than  ever
before to understand and contribute to the Budget process.  The  quality  of
information available to Parliament has improved over  the  past  few  years
through a number of laws, but  also  through  the  redesign  of  the  Budget
documentation and the provision of new  information  from  the  Treasury  in
documents, such  as  that  would  stipulate  the  Medium-  Term  Expenditure
Framework, the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, the section  32  expenditure
and revenue reports in accordance with the Public  Finance  Management  Act.
All of these assist us to more adequately build  our  role  in  scrutinising
the Budget.

But, I sometimes think that members of the public who  observe  our  various
Budget Vote debates each year must surely  be  asking  questions  about  the
link between our debates and the Budget  that  is  mentioned  in  the  Order
Paper. The majority of our speeches  tend  to  be  a  repetition  of  policy
statements. Sometimes they are announcements of new policy ideas - at  times
untested new  policy  ideas  -  and  sometimes  they  are  a  reflection  on
achievements. Perhaps we as Parliament are to blame  for  having  failed  to
set down clear criteria of areas we wish to see  addressed  in  Budget  Vote
debates.

In considering our own parliamentary budget, it seems to me, as  a  minimum,
that the following questions should be  part  of  the  contribution  in  the
debate: Firstly, what funds were voted in the financial year  under  review?
Secondly, were there any priorities set out as  part  of  the  budget  plan?
Thirdly,  were  these  priorities  achieved?  Fourthly,   were   there   any
unanticipated occurrences that caused expenditure  that  we  hadn't  planned
for? And fifth, are there policy changes that have emerged as  a  result  of
the experience in the preceding financial year?

I think our debate today offers us as the National Council of  Provinces  an
opportunity to illustrate our perspective on  the  future  shape  of  Budget
Vote debates. Firstly,  we  take  it  as  given  that  the  core  policy  of
Parliament remains intact and that in the course of the debate we  will  and
can indicate new developments and challenges.

To begin with, we can note that in the financial year just past,  Parliament
was voted  R480,2  million.  This  allocation  was  distributed  across  the
various divisions of Parliament as follows: The bulk of the  funds  went  to
personnel  costs  -  R117.5Â million;  administrative  expenditure  -   R97,5
million, including inventories, equipment, professional services,  etc.  And
then a large portion went to members' support, as well as the direct  charge
that is related to members' salaries and pension contributions.

When we assess our expenditure against this R480 million, we  find  that  by
the end of the past financial year, we  exceeded  our  allocation  by  R22,5
million. The funds voted to Parliament, however, provided a  great  deal  of
support in a range of areas.

Firstly, there is committee work.  We  all  know  that  committees  are  the
engine room of Parliament. They  are  the  primary  vehicle  for  increasing
public  participation  in  the  legislative  process.  At  present  in   our
Parliament  we  have  50  parliamentary  committees:  27  in  the   National
Assembly, 10 in the National Council of Provinces, 6 joint  committees,  and
7 ad hoc committees. A staff of 131 support  the  activities  of  committees
and they work on a budget for committees of R12 million.

Last year, these committees debated and approved 75 Bills -  53  section  75
Bills, 10 Money Bills, 10 section 76 Bills and 2 constitutional  amendments.
The committees produced and adopted 376 reports - 176 reports on  Bills,  75
on international agreements and 129 on oversight work by committees.

Our committees also amended many more  Bills  than  ever  before,  and  even
redrafted six of the  Bills  presented  to  Parliament.  In  2001,  we  only
redrafted one Bill. So clearly, our Parliament is becoming better at  making
better laws. We think these are laudable achievements.

There was some disquiet recently, when it was discovered  that  last  year's
committee budget of R12,6 million had been underspent by  R7,4  million.  In
order  to  prevent  this  happening  in  the  future,  we  have   introduced
performance budgeting  that  will  allow  committees  to  manage  their  own
budgets - an overall budget that has been increased to R14 million  in  this
new financial year. Performance budgeting is in our view an  improvement  on
the  traditional  form  of  budgeting.  It's  a  system  of  budgeting  that
integrates  strategic   planning,   financial   planning   and   performance
management. It is a system that enables us to allocate  resources  in  terms
of agreed goals. It is a system that enables us to focus on how we  actually
spend our funds.

Secondly, we have as an achievement our Parliament to the People  Programme.
In October 2002, the  NCOP  mounted  its  first  Parliament  to  the  People
Programme in the Eastern Cape province. In March 2003, we hosted the  second
Parliament to the People Programme in the North West  province.  We  believe
that this programme, aimed at ensuring that we directly link  our  democracy
to the people of our country, is a programme that gives value for  money  to
the thousands of people that we have reached.

Thirdly, and lastly, our Parliament has continued  its  growing  interaction
with African and other parliaments. We had a successful meeting  of  African
parliaments in July 2002, prior to  the  inaugural  summit  of  the  African
Union, and this was one the items that led to that  overexpenditure  of  R22
million. So it was, I  think,  defensible  expenditure  on  our  part.  That
meeting  gave  detailed  attention  to  the   challenges   associated   with
establishing a Pan African Parliament and  adopted  a  resolution  that  was
submitted to the summit of African Union heads of state.

We also hosted visits from the President of Italy, the  Emir  of  Qatar  and
the President of the Hellenic Republic.  We  sent  an  observer  mission  to
Zimbabwe. Members and  presiding  officers  held  visits  in  the  following
countries: Botswana, Uganda, Namibia, Switzerland, China, Sudan,  Japan  and
Mozambique.  These  were  associated  with  the  Commonwealth  Parliamentary
Association and Inter-parliamentary Union, as well as official NCOP visits.

Unfortunately, we have been unable to glean further activity on the part  of
our Parliament from the report  on  the  year  from  the  Secretary  of  the
institution, given that that report is not yet ready for our  consideration.
Sadly, unlike reports from the executive, which have been arriving hard  and
fast in the House, since the beginning of the March, we as  Parliament  have
failed in this particular regard, and I think this is  something  the  Joint
Rules Committee must give attention to.

As we report on these international links and  programmes,  I  think  it  is
important that we refer briefly to  the  support  that  our  Parliament  has
received from international donors. In  particular,  I  refer  here  to  the
European Union. All of us are familiar with the EU  Support  Programme.  The
programme has involved the sum of R115 million over a period of  six  years.
It began in 1996 and has come to an end this May, 2003.

The aim  of  the  programme  was  to  enhance  good  governance  and  stable
democracy  by  strengthening  the  role  of  the  national  and   provincial
legislatures in fulfilling  their  constitutional  obligations.  There  were
five key result areas: the improvement of parliamentary  infrastructure  and
services;  the  improvement  of  MPs'  and   MPLs'   parliamentary   skills;
improvement  in  institutional  arrangements;   improvement   in   providing
programmes of public participation;  and  improvement  in  the  co-operation
across legislatures.

I am pleased to be able  to  say  to  our  House  that  Parliament  and  the
European Union have begun discussions and processes that should  lead  to  a
new parliamentary support  programme,  supported  by  the  EU  for  all  the
legislatures in our country. We are also pleased to be able to  report  that
our Parliament and the African Capacity Building Foundation, which is  based
in Harare, Zimbabwe, have entered into a support programme  discussion  that
will strengthen the ability of our members of Parliament  to  perform  their
constitutional  functions.  The  programme,  once  the  funding   has   been
realised,  will  help  build  better  research  capacity,  better  oversight
mechanisms, strengthen committee support, provide training for  new  MPs  in
the next Parliament, and help us to build  capacity  for  the  parliamentary
dimension of the African Union.

I must hasten to add that the fact that the Capacity Building Foundation  is
based in Harare, does not mean that it is the foundation of  the  government
of Zimbabwe. It is  an  internationally  funded  foundation  which  has  its
headquarters in Harare.

There are, as well, positive developments in activities planned for the  new
financial year, 2003-04, for which our Parliament's budget has increased  to
a substantial R627 million. We plan  to  strengthen  committee  support  and
ensure that our committees carry out their work in terms of clear  criteria.
We have agreed to focus on the following:  Increased  public  participation,
efforts to strengthen the understanding and participation  in  democracy  in
our country, and efforts to  strengthen  the  institutional  mechanisms  for
enhancing the ability of  members  to  process  legislations  from  a  fully
informed and independent or objective perspective.

All  members  would  be  aware  that  at  the  moment,  when   we   consider
legislation, we  rely  on  advice  from  the  department  that  is  bringing
legislation to Parliament. We use the legal advisers of the  executive,  and
I must say that they've supported our committees' work very well. But it  is
important that we build the institutional capacity to carry out  this  work,
so that we do play the full role our Constitution anticipates.

We also plan to enhance the use of technology in Parliament, and  especially
in the NCOP, as an important part of ensuring full provincial  participation
in national matters. I am sure, hon Tsenoli, you will  be  worried  to  hear
that we may reduce your trips to Cape  Town,  because  we  will  have  video
conferencing, which will allow you to speak from the Free State to  us  here
in Parliament in Cape Town.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Chairperson,
could you round off, please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you  very  much,  Deputy  Chairperson.  I
have so little opportunity to speak in this House ... [Laughter.] ... Now  I
am trying to cover all areas.

I think there is a range of areas of improvement and hon members,  in  their
contributions, certainly will touch on them. However,  it  is  important  to
say, having the Deputy President here as the Leader of Government  Business,
that we believe our programme planning would  be  greatly  enhanced  if  the
executive could provide Parliament with an accurate map of  legislation  for
each year.

We are also concerned, hon Leader of Government Business, that  an  old  and
inefficient practice, which we had changed, has now been revived,  and  that
is the practice of introducing section 76 Bills in  the  other  House.  Last
year, only two of the 10 section 76 Bills were  introduced  in  this  House.
Clearly, we would like to see some change there and  I  have  noticed,  with
legislation this year, that this new practice is continuing. We, of  course,
accept that it is a prerogative of the executive to decide  which  House  to
favour with introduction.  But  before  legislation  is  placed  before  one
House, delays in processing Bills will occur.

In conclusion, I think that it is important to say that the outline  of  our
progress in the past financial year shows clearly  that  our  democracy  has
laid a firm foundation for a  sustainable  democracy.  Now  that  the  basic
blocks are in place, the task of Parliament is to ensure  the  selection  of
appropriate support material to ensure that we do not falter. The hard  work
of our members last year sends a strong signal of our intention to make  the
National Council of Provinces a House of the  people,  fully  responsive  to
the mandate of supporting South Africans in creating a better life  for  all
Africans. Thank you very much, Deputy Chairperson. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! It is both you and I who are  not
given enough opportunity to speak in this House.  But,  congratulations  and
thank you very much.

The  DEPUTY  PRESIDENT:  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces, hon members, delegates and colleagues, I'm pleased to  have  this
opportunity, once again, to interact with this august House on the  occasion
of the parliamentary Budget Vote for 2003-04.

 I would like to acknowledge the concerns raised by the Chairperson  of  the
NCOP with regard to the section 76 Bills. I  will  try  to  look  into  that
issue. I must also agree with the Chairperson that the House should do  more
with regard to considering how the Budget is utilised. Doing  so,  I  think,
as Parliament, we'll be doing our job of oversight very well. I think  there
must be very clear oversight with regard  to  how  the  finances  are  used,
because at times there are clear priorities. At  times  the  priorities  are
not necessarily followed.  It's  your  duty  as  public  representatives  to
indicate how we should utilise the funds, and even to detect  whether  there
are weaknesses or no weaknesses at all in this regard.

I have said before, and I hope you will not mind me repeating  it,  that  no
other institution in  the  country  can  showcase  our  beautiful  and  rich
diversity as a nation quite as succinctly as the NCOP.  I'm  sure  that  the
authors of our Constitution would be very pleased to  see  how  their  noble
intentions are being realised.

Having given life to the principle of  co-operative  governance  a  powerful
voice to the masses of our people in the various provinces and local  areas,
we are, through the efforts of the NCOP, building and consolidating  a  true
participatory democracy. This House is the point  of  convergence  of  these
spheres of government, all three of them, which quite uniquely positions  it
as the bedrock of integrated and co-operative governance. It  is  the  forum
where issues of critical importance to the provinces  and  local  government
are debated on the national platform.

I, however, want to argue that  maybe  the  NCOP  is  underutilised  by  the
provinces and especially by organised local government. I am saying this  in
the light of some crucial matters that are not  placed  effectively  on  the
national agenda by  the  provinces  or  Salga.  For  instance,  the  ongoing
challenges faced with respect to the cross-border municipalities  have  been
on the table for a long time. However, municipalities have not shared  their
insight, experience  and  knowledge  adequately  to  allow  us  to  reach  a
practical and permanent solution in this regard. I do not  think  we  should
allow this to continue, because there are problems.

Equally importantly, I think we need to point  out  the  challenges  arising
from  our  integrated  approach  in  terms  of   national   and   provincial
competencies. We note, for example, the oversight  work  done  by  the  NCOP
with regard to the payment of social grants, with  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs - the national department - issuing the  identity  documents  needed
for social grant applications and the  provinces  administering  the  actual
grants.

Even in this regard, we need to engage municipalities that  very  often  are
responsible for the venues where these grants are paid  out.  They  need  to
take steps to ensure that  our  elders  and  people  with  disabilities  are
treated with dignity as they receive the grants.

I would also like to invite you to  build  on  the  input  you  are  already
making in terms of building our national democracy. It  is  true  that  your
location,  character  and  constitutional  responsibilities  oblige  you  to
further develop sound intergovernmental relations as a common objective.  As
we all know, it is the responsibility of the national Government to  provide
support to the provinces. Similarly, it is the duty of provinces to  provide
assistance to municipalities.

In this regard, the NCOP is a necessary  intermediary  that  represents  all
provinces and  organised  local  government  in  a  collective  manner.  The
debates in this House are, after all, informed by actual experiences on  the
ground. They afford us an opportunity to achieve national consensus  on  our
collective aim of pushing back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  and  remind  us
constantly of the peculiarities of the provinces within  the  broader  scope
of the national picture. In this manner, the NCOP distinguishes itself  from
the National Assembly in a very particular way. While the National  Assembly
is able to visit one or two provinces at a time, the NCOP is  able  to  send
out nine delegations to all nine provinces simultaneously.

In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity  to  congratulate  you
on your recent meetings in the North West and  Eastern  Cape  provinces.  By
adopting this new style, you are really bringing Parliament  closer  to  the
people. Such interaction  allows  an  invaluable  immediate  assessment  and
evaluation of policy implementation countrywide.

The NCOP is  therefore  in  a  position  to  detect  problems  facing  local
governments,  particularly  with  regard  to  their   finances.   You   are,
therefore, in a position to assist at an earlier stage, before the  remedial
intervention envisaged in the Constitution becomes necessary.

As I said earlier, there remains a  number  of  critical  challenges  as  we
complete the last year of the first decade of democracy. The  most  pressing
is the transformation of Parliament. The finalisation  of  the  mission  and
vision of Parliament is therefore critical. We need to begin to  define  the
proceedings and procedures of Parliament less along the  Western  style  and
become more African in  character.  In  this  regard,  the  design  of  this
Chamber, away from the two-party arrangement, is an important milestone  and
contribution.

We agree that  some  of  the  challenges  we  face  include,  among  others,
continuing to ensure that the distinctive nature of  the  NCOP  is  utilised
and recognised. We do not want to fall into the trap of seeing it as  merely
a mirror of the National Assembly. Given the size of the NCOP,  we  need  to
ensure that the 54 permanent delegates are able to perform  their  functions
effectively. Similarly, we need to strive for the effective  utilisation  of
the special delegates and the provincial legislatures they represent.

We also need to work actively to ensure that the voice of  local  government
becomes more effective and influential as we  strengthen  the  principle  of
integrated governance. In addition, we  still  need  to  do  the  following:
ensure that section 76  Bills  are  thoroughly  dealt  with  to  enrich  the
national legislative process with the views and concerns  of  provinces  and
local areas, and conscientise provinces and municipalities  to  look  beyond
local boundaries and to reach deep into Africa as we work to regenerate  the
continent and promote Nepad and the African Union.

It is important that we do all the above as we assess the first 10 years  of
democratic governance, while at the same  time  projecting  the  objectives,
challenges and prospects of the next 10 years.

This House is a perfect platform to celebrate our diversity,  especially  in
the area of language development.  It  not  only  represents  the  different
tongues our people speak, but also  the  uniqueness  of  our  provinces  and
people. It should therefore serve as a constant reminder to  all  of  us  to
play a role  in  promoting  our  indigenous  languages  in  both  Houses  of
Parliament, to set an example, especially  in  the  light  of  the  upcoming
national language conference.

In conclusion, let me reiterate that I have full confidence in  the  ability
and capacity of this House to translate the ideals of a better life for  all
into a daily reality for our people. My confidence stems from  the  manifold
contributions you have  already  made  in  ensuring  the  progress  we  have
achieved so far. Deputy Chairperson, let me wish this House all the best  in
the business of the current session. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, it is an honour to  follow  on  the  Deputy
President, and I want to thank him for the insight  he  has  into  the  role
that this august House does play.

On 6 June last year, when  we  debated  this  vote,  I  was  in  the  Chair,
presiding over this debate. But, obviously I was too strict  and  posed  too
much competition for the presiding officers, and that  is  the  reason  they
did not ask me again. ... [Laughter.]  ...  But,  as  I  sat  there,  I  can
remember, it was very difficult to keep a straight face when  members  spoke
about things they did not know much about.  For  instance,  when  the  Chief
Whip referred to a ``boerbok'', some members looked at me and  thought  that
I was the boer in the chair he was referring to. ... [Laughter.]  ...  After
my experience, I have much more  respect  for  presiding  officers  handling
debates, always with a straight face.

Op 'n baie ernstiger noot: die rol van die NRVP is werklik  'n  grondwetlike
verbintenis tot samewerkende regering.  Dit  beteken  dat  nasionale  beleid
sensitief moet wees vir provinsiale en plaaslike regerings se  behoeftes  en
besorgdhede. Hierdie behoeftes en besorgdhede mag nie sommer net  geÃ¯gnoreer
word nie, en daar is talle probleme  wat  ons  nie  mag  ignoreer  nie.  Dit
beteken egter  ook  dat  munisipaliteite,  maar  veral  provinsies,  nie  in
afsondering moet optree nie, want ons is daar.

Hierdie Raad is in wese ontwerp, en is al hoe meer besig  om  te  ontwikkel,
om in bogenoemde behoefte te voldoen. Dit is duidelik in  die  Grondwet  dat
ons hoofdoel juis is om deel te neem  in  die  nasionale  proses  van  wette
maak, en om 'n nasionale platform  daar  te  stel  vir  openbare  debat  oor
provinsiale sake. Die meeste provinsies  doen  deeglike  werk  wanneer  daar
beraadslaag word oor artikel 76 - wetgewing,  maar  die  uitvoerende  gesag,
soos reeds genoem deur die  agb  Voorsitter,  besef  egter  nie  die  waarde
daarvan om hierdie wetgewing eerste in die NRVP in te dien nie.

Ek is dankbaar dat die Adjunkpresident daarop gewys het dat hy  diÃ©  gedagte
ook met sy kollegas sal bespreek. Ek hoop hy  hoor  dit  nog  'n  paar  keer
vandag sodat hy die dringendheid en die belangrikheid wesenlik besef.

Ek wil spesiale dank betuig aan die Voorsitter van  hierdie  Raad  vir  haar
passie om hierdie Raad te laat slaag as 'n funksionele  bate  van  die  nuwe
demokrasie, en vir die leiding om die begroting nuut en vars aan te  spreek.
Ek het egter 'n dringende versoek, en dit  is  dat  die  implementering  van
besluite in die Gesamentlike ReÃ«lskomitee  met  'n  fermer  hand  buite  die
komitee moet plaasvind. Maar, in dieselfde asem wil ek haar versoek  om  met
'n minder  ferm  hand  die  programmeringsweep,  Mr  Mohammed  Sulliman,  te
hanteer.

Sy werk verg 'n spesiale soort mens, wat hy  dan  ook  is.  Ons  bedank  hom
daarvoor,  en  ook  die  Hoofsweep,  mnr  Surtee,   wat   werklik,   behalwe
organisatoriese leiding, ook politieke rigting aan  hierdie  instansie,  die
NRVP gee. Daar is egter nog provinsiale swepe wat nie daarin  slaag  om  hul
lede as 'n span saam te snoer nie, en dit is 'n uitdaging.

Die werking  van  die  gekose  komitees  het  'n  drastiese  verbetering  in
kwantitatiewe  en  kwalitatiewe  aktiwiteite   getoon,   en   deelname   aan
onderhandeling  oor  wetgewing  word  deurgaans  op  'n   deursigtige   wyse
aangemoedig, en ons  dank  ook  die  nuwe  voorsitter  van  die  voorsitters
daarvoor.

Die deelname uit die provinsies is puik, maar daar  is  tog  enkele  gevalle
waar lede uit provinsies se bydraes in die komitees en/of sittings  nie  die
koste van hulle hierheen reis regverdig nie, en dieselfde is seker waar  van
'n paar van ons lede wanneer ons na die provinsies toe gaan. Daarom sal  die
moderne kommunikasietegnologie waarna die voorsitter verwys  het,  verwelkom
word.

Met die aanloop na die verkiesing volgende jaar sal die druk op komitees  en
personeel toeneem, en  hulle  moet  daarop  voorbereid  wees  en  baie  goed
beplan. Dit is  tog  jammer  dat  dit  altyd  blyk  dat  die  begroting  nie
voldoende is nie, en dit terwyl daar nou onderbestee word.  Daarom  sal  die
nuwe bestuur van die begroting ook verwelkom word sodat  daar  altyd  genoeg
geld  is  om  te  bestee  op  die  ontwikkeling  van  die  lede  en  op  die
blootstelling wat die lede moet kry.

Die neem van die NRVP  na  die  mense  van  die  Oos-Kaap  en  die  Noordwes
provinsie is 'n goeie en noodsaaklike ontwikkeling, maar nog  meer  deelname
van die publiek is nodig, en op die twee ondervindings kan  daar  vir  gebou
word.

Die belofte dat gaste en die media op die galerye van  beide  Huise  toegang
tot gehoorstukke sou hÃª, om te kan inskakel by die tolkdiens,  het  nog  nie
plaasgevind nie. Ek is bly dat die Adjunkpresident ook  verwys  het  na  die
taalbelangrikheid in die Huise, want dit is bloot net ongeskik om  gaste  in
jou huis te hÃª, en dan praat jy tale wat hulle nie  kan  verstaan  nie.  Dit
bevorder net een ding, en dit is dat almal na Engels gryp, en die  persepsie
word geskep dat dit die enigste taal is wat die moeite werd is.

Ek is egter seker dat die parlementÃªre taalbeleid, wat nou  ontwikkel  word,
ook binnekort hierdie ongemaklikheid gaan  aanspreek.  Die  besluit  is  nou
geneem dat daar 'n standbeeld van president Mandela op die  gronde  van  die
Parlement gaan wees, maar terselfdertyd is daar nou ook genoeg genesing  oor
die ag/nege jaar dat die beleid oor kunswerke in die parlement  ten  uitvoer
gebring kan word, want  hierdie  leÃ«,  kaal,  wit  mure  is  regtig  nie  'n
vertoonvenster vir die kleurryke, dinamiese  Suid-Afrika  wat  ons  is  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[On a more serious note: The role of the NCOP  is  really  a  constitutional
commitment to co-operative  governance.  This  means  that  national  policy
should be sensitive to the  needs  and  concerns  of  provincial  and  local
governments. These needs and concerns should not summarily be  ignored,  and
there are many problems which we may not ignore. This, however,  also  means
that municipalities, but the especially the provinces,  should  not  act  in
isolation because we are there.

This Council has been developed in essence, and is  still  busy  developing,
in order to comply with the  above-mentioned  needs.  It  is  clear  in  the
Constitution that our main aim is precisely to participate in  the  national
process of law making, and to put in place a national  platform  for  public
debate regarding provincial matters. Most of the provinces do thorough  work
when  they  deliberate  on  section  76  legislation,  but   the   executive
authority, as already mentioned by the hon Chairperson,  however,  does  not
realise the value of submitting this legislation first to the NCOP.

I am thankful that the Deputy President  indicated  that  he  would  discuss
this idea with his colleagues as well. I hope that he will  hear  it  a  few
more times today so that he can essentially realise the importance  and  the
urgency thereof.

I would like to express a special thanks to the Chairperson of this  Council
for her passion to make this Council succeed as a functional  asset  of  the
new democracy, and for the leadership to address this Budget in  a  new  and
fresh manner. I do, however, have an urgent request and  that  is  that  the
implementation of decisions taken in the Joint Rules Committee  should  take
place with a firmer hand outside the committee. However, in the same  breath
I would like to request her to deal with the Programming Whip,  Mr  Mohammed
Sulliman, with a less firm hand.

His work requires a special type of person, which he also is. We  thank  him
for that and also the Chief Whip Mr  Surtee,  who  really,  in  addition  to
organisational  leadership,  also  gives  political   leadership   to   this
institution, the NCOP. There are, however, still  provincial  whips  who  do
not succeed in co-ordinating their members as a  team  and  that  remains  a
challenge.

The work of the select  committees  have  shown  a  drastic  improvement  in
quantitative and qualitative activities, and  participation  in  negotiation
regarding legislation is continuously encouraged in  a  transparent  manner,
and we thank the new Chairperson of Chairpersons for that.

The participation from the provinces  is  excellent,  but  there  are  still
singular instances where the contributions of members from the provinces  in
the committees and/or sittings, do not  justify  the  costs  for  travelling
here, and the same is surely true for a few of our members  when  we  go  to
the provinces. For that reason the  modern  communication  technology  which
the Chairperson referred to will be welcomed.

With the run-up to the elections next year the pressure  on  the  committees
and personnel will increase and they should be well prepared  for  that  and
plan very well. It is surely a pity that it always seems as  if  the  budget
is not enough, when in actual fact we have now  experienced  under-spending.
For that reason the new management of the budget would also be  welcomed  so
that we always have enough money to spend on the development of members  and
on the exposure that members should receive.

The taking of the NCOP to the people of the Eastern Cape and the North  West
province is a good and necessary development, but  more  participation  from
the public is necessary, and we can surely build on these two experiences.

The promise that guests and the media in the galleries of both Houses  would
have access to earpieces to enable them  to  tune  in  to  the  interpreting
service has still not taken place. I am pleased that  the  Deputy  President
also referred to the importance of language in the  Houses,  because  it  is
simply rude to have guests in your house and then you speak languages  which
they do not understand. This promotes only  one  thing,  and  that  is  that
everybody reverts to English and the perception is being created  that  this
is the only language which is worth our while.

I am, however, sure that the parliamentary language  policy,  which  is  now
being developed, will shortly also address this  unease.  The  decision  has
now been taken that we will have  a  statue  of  President  Mandela  on  the
parliamentary grounds, but at the same time we have had enough healing  over
the  past  eight/nine  years  so  that  the  policy  regarding  artwork   at
Parliament can be executed, because  these  empty,  bare,  white  walls  are
really no display window of the colourful,  dynamic  South  Africa  that  we
are.]

In conclusion, most of us have the commitment and the talent  to  make  this
institution work even better, for not only the members,  but  also  for  the
people in the provinces whom we represent. We have the  commitment  and  the
talent, through the grace of God, to make this place work and to make  South
Africa work so as to better  the  lives  of  all  those  who  live  in  this
beautiful country, South Africa, that we  inherited  from  our  forefathers.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson  of
Committees, hon members, let me begin by saying that when  I  was  appointed
Deputy Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, I  was  humbled  by
the confidence bestowed upon me by  the  members  of  the  Council,  and  I,
therefore, took up the honour with much enthusiasm. To me this was the  next
step, having been Chairperson of Committees  before.  I  realised  that  the
Council faced challenges in terms of its constitutional mandate.

I am informed by the students of parliamentary law that the NCOP is  one  of
a very small number of upper Houses that have their mandate clearly  spelled
out. The NCOP is an upper House because its members have to be  elected  and
appointed to it by the  first  House.  Therefore,  you  are  important,  you
belong to an upper House.

Hon MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): It is,  in  fact,  the
glue that sticks South Africans together. The three  spheres  of  Government
meet in the NCOP - I want to make this point very clear. The judiciary,  the
legislatures and the executive, all have business to do in the NCOP. We  all
come here, including even the local government sphere, to decide on  and  to
talk about the issues that effect us as a country.

Last, but most importantly, all the  interests  of  South  Africans  can  be
voiced in the NCOP  through  the  provincial  delegations  and  in  all  the
languages best known to the provinces. The Deputy President has  alluded  to
that - I am very glad.  Because  of  this,  the  NCOP  has  to  conduct  its
business in a manner that is sensitive to  this  constitutional  obligation.
To this end, the National Council of Provinces has embarked on a  series  of
reforms to ensure that it delivers on its mandate.

The Council has identified three areas  needing  special  attention  in  the
process of the transformation of delivery  on  its  constitutional  mandate,
namely: the procedure, the oversight and the management of  the  Council.  I
will touch on this briefly, because I don't have much time.

In terms of the management of the Council, the Council  has  embarked  on  a
process of strategic and business planning. The process entails planning  at
a political level by identifying the strategic objectives  of  the  Council.
These are, therefore, assigned to the various  business  units  of  business
planning. All these,  in  turn,  are  translated  into  the  budget  of  the
Council.

Any institution without a strategic plan cannot function properly. And I  am
very glad to say that the  NCOP  has  embarked  on  that.  All  other  units
embodied in the National Council of Provinces can  then  also  derive  their
mandates and their working plans from the  strategic  plan  and,  therefore,
measure their performance against the targets that they have set  themselves
and so achieve their goals.

In terms of the oversight function, the Council has now resolved to  conduct
proactive oversight. This entails determining  Acts  which  have  provincial
interest  and  investigating  problems  of  implementation  in  the  various
provinces. In effect, this will lead to co-operation among legislatures.

At this point, it is important to have a clear understanding  of  the  areas
of competence of legislatures  and  of  the  NCOP  in  order  to  avoid  any
misunderstanding, and to foster co-operation between  the  legislatures  and
the National Council of Provinces.

It is, however, very important that there  be  strong  co-operation  between
the legislatures and the Council on these visits and  the  findings  of  the
programmes, to enable the Council to deliver its constitutional  mandate.  I
will come back to the procedures in relation to these issues.

There was a workshop in 2001 and during this exercise the  Chairperson  gave
good leadership and guidance on the crystallisation and distillation of  the
concept of constitutional provision. We tend to avoid these  things.  And  I
need to come back to that point because I want to emphasise it.

A reasonable start was made by the Council in the year 2002 by  focusing  on
the provincial interest and  always  advancing  the  provincial  perspective
during the debates generally, and during the processing  of  legislation  in
particular. This area is given priority as it is central  to  the  existence
of the Council.
This approach is not only expected of members of the Council,  but  also  of
the executive. When the executive is addressing the Council on  any  matter,
it is expected to focus on the provincial impact  of  their  legislation  on
the policy they are addressing the  Council  on.  That  is  crucial  to  me,
because we are a special  House.  We  represent  certain  interests  of  the
provinces. Therefore, we have to highlight and indicate that in the  debates
that we have in the Council. Otherwise, we are not saying anything in  terms
of provincial interests.

Members are urged to internalise the concept of  provincial  perspective  in
their debating, the questions asked and the motions moved in the  House  and
in the scrutinisation of  the  Bills.  The  importance  of  this  cannot  be
overemphasised, especially given the recent experience with  regard  to  the
Constitutional Amendment Act of 2002.

Let me quickly deal with the implications of the three things  that  I  have
mentioned.  Regarding  the  management  of  the  Council,  the   skills   of
chairpersons of committees on general principles  of  management  and  basic
parliamentary finance management are of  paramount  importance  in  ensuring
delivery. The Chairperson of Committees is seized with this task.

The strategic plan of the Council will provide measures for  the  evaluation
of the performance of the Council in that it is going  to  detail  the  task
that the Council has set itself during the year 2004-05, and  the  resources
necessary for that. This will inform the business plans  of  the  committees
and administration, and  determine  the  budget  of  the  Council.  This  is
crucial. It goes back to what I said  at  the  beginning,  namely  that  you
cannot do anything without a strategic plan. Therefore as  a  business  unit
we'll have to function within this broad strategic plan of the NCOP.

In terms of procedures, provincial delegations are in  Cape  Town,  and  yet
they are expected to advance the  provincial  interest  at  national  level.
This can only be done  with  the  assistance  and  support  of  the  various
legislatures. This support entails supplying the delegation with reports  of
incidents taking place in the provinces worthy of being in a  motion  or  in
order for members to raise  the  profile  of  events  taking  place  in  the
provinces.

In turn, the attention of national Government will be  drawn  to  events  in
the provinces and it will be prompted to act where necessary. It is our  job
to bring to the attention of the national Government the  issues  raised  in
the provinces, because we want the  national  Government  to  act  on  these
issues and not just be aware of them and do nothing about them.

During debates  on  legislation  legislatures  should  occasionally  furnish
delegates with information  as  to  how  the  particular  legislation  would
impact on the provinces. Provincial legislatures should also  support  their
delegations by providing them with information to then  ask  questions  that
would assist in drawing the attention of the  national  Parliament  and  the
executive to particular provincial issues.  In  this  way  the  legislatures
will  assist  the  delegations  in  discharging  the  NCOP's  constitutional
mandate.
The last issue on oversight which I want  to  touch  on  is  the  following.
Oversight is going to be conducted from ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Deputy Chairperson, would  you  please  round
off, please, as your time has expired.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): In rounding  off,  let
met say that communication with the provinces -  particularly  in  terms  of
our programme relating to provincial visits - is crucial,  because  we  have
to co-ordinate our programmes as we go down to the provinces; not to  impose
ourselves on them, but to work together with them. Thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, in this new Parliament we not  only  make  laws,
but we create or adopt good or bad conventions. We are in  the  business  of
foundational politics at this time  in  our  history.  We  have  made  great
progress. We are the custodians not  only  of  the  law,  but  we  are  also
custodians of the image of Parliament. The dignity  of  Parliament  and  the
way we use our buildings and respect them too  is  also  important.  Winston
Churchill said, and I quote: ``First  we  shape  our  buildings,  then  they
shape us.''

I have a huge problem with the way we are  allowing  our  Parliament  to  be
cheapened by inappropriate exhibitions. We need, somehow, to create a  venue
where departmental or NGO exhibitions can take  place,  without  making  the
lobbies and corridors of power look shabby and littered with  pamphlets  and
trinkets everybody takes, but few read or use.

The departments also need talking to. I don't know about my colleagues,  but
every morning I am bombed  with  expensive  glossy  reports  and  magazines,
costing a fortune, most of which we consign to the waste paper  basket.  The
departments need to filter what they put out and to use lower cost means  of
production and of informing us; perhaps even electronic means. I feel  sorry
for the trees that are cut down, and that have grown in vain.

We live in a poor  country.  We  can't  afford  such  conspicuous  waste.  A
standard format, such as one the Auditor-General uses,  for  example,  would
be easier to follow and better, in our oversight function.

Does every department that reports to Parliament each year  need  to  invite
all the members to lunch or dinner to celebrate every time they  read  their
budgets? We don't  need  to  go  to  night  clubs  or  gambling  casinos  or
mannequin parades to celebrate anything which is our duty  to  do,  and  for
which we are paid very well. There is a time for  celebration  -  of  course
there is - but this constant lunch every time we have something is just  not
on. We are all overweight, most of us, and most of us have little  time  ...
[Interjections.] ... It is just a conspicuous waste. We  are  poor  country.
The cost is born by the taxpayers.  It  is  a  corrupting  and  a  corrosive
process.

Cocktail parties, lunches, dinners and fashion  parades  are  all  good  and
well, in private time with our own money, but not for us who are paid to  do
our jobs already. Please let us think about it. We do not  want  to  develop
false illusions of grandeur.

Finally, when the President attends a debate of the NCOP, and  I  have  huge
respect for the President, we have the honour of receiving him here.  Is  it
really necessary for him to arrive in a cavalcade  of  cars  from  Tuynhuys,
only 200 meters away, and then to advance  up  a  long  red  carpet?  It  is
simply too much and smacks of Lilliputian thinking ... [Interjections.]  ...
He can stroll over. He is very welcome here.

I've learnt in my life, and I've had the privilege of  working  in  over  70
countries, that the richer and more successful the country, the simpler  the
offices and the arrangements ... [Time expired.]

Mr K D S DURR: [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order!  Order!  Order,
Mr Durr. Your speaking time has expired. Order! Order!, Mr Durr.

Mr T S SETONA: Deputy Chair, can the hon member take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Are  you  willing  to
take a question, Mr Durr?

Mr K D S DURR: When I have completed my speech.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Complete your  speech.
Your time has expired.

Mr K D S DURR: It is vital that we keep our lives simple  and  Spartan  -  I
move.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Chairperson, at times it  becomes  disturbing
to hear the hon member, whom I thought  was  very  mature,  being  a  church
leader, speaking on behalf of churches in this  Parliament,  having  been  a
former member of the very Parliament that did some of the  bad  things  that
it did. For him to stand up here and say the things he is  saying  today  is
unfortunate. Hon Durr is just out of order. You might as well  say  nothing,
Mr Durr, rather than say what you are saying.

Thank you very much for the opportunity. May I take it not to respond to  Mr
Durr again. Maybe we'll meet in a  committee  meeting  somewhere,  where  we
will resolve our problems with him.

Six years ago  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  was  established.  The
drafters of the Constitution, from whom the noble idea of  establishing  the
second House of Parliament which became known as  the  National  Council  of
Provinces emanated, saw the  need  for  a  House  which  would  enhance  and
promote principles of participatory democracy and co-operative governance.

Mindful of the practices of the undemocratic  apartheid  era,  the  drafters
took a decision that never again should the state be unaccountable  for  its
actions and undemocratic in its decision-making.  The  National  Council  of
Provinces, being a forum that incorporates the three spheres of  government,
was perceived as an appropriate House that would advance these noble ideas.

Those who were members at the time of establishing this House saw  the  role
of the National Council of Provinces as that of unifying the  South  African
nation. We saw this House as the custodian of co-operative  governance.  The
question is: Have we been able to live up to these expectations?

On this occasion of the debate on Budget Vote No 2 -  Parliament,  allow  me
to highlight the achievements during the past six years of existence of  and
challenges faced by this august House.

I can proudly say that within a short space of time the National Council  of
Provinces has been able to achieve a lot. To a large extent we have  managed
to live up to the expectations of the drafters. We've been  able  to  adhere
to the provisions of the Constitution. There are a few  instances  in  which
the National Council of  Provinces  was  subpoenaed  by  the  Constitutional
Court for contravening sections of the Constitution, but  we  were  able  to
defend our position as this House.

In passing legislation we have followed the provincial cycle to the  letter.
We brief our provinces on  section  76  Bills  and  other  Bills  that  have
implications for our provinces. Public hearings are conducted in  provinces.
In this way we have been able to ensure and promote participatory  democracy
by allowing citizens in our provinces to participate on matters that  affect
their daily lives. We have been able to bring decision-making closer to  our
people.

Communication with our provinces is at an acceptable level. To this end,  we
are able to communicate with our provinces through the NCOP Online  and  the
liaison office staff. In this regard, we wish to  thank  presiding  officers
and the provincial Whips for their leadership.

Select committees in the National Council of Provinces work in earnest.  For
effective operation of our select committees system we  have  clustered  our
committees, in line with Cabinet  clustering.  Our  select  committees  have
also conducted oversight functions. Through their work, we  have  been  able
to intervene in certain local municipalities as required by section  139  of
our Constitution.

From  last  year  this  House  undertook  two  projects  called   ``Bringing
Parliament to the People''. We went to  the  Eastern  Cape.  Through  public
hearings, we interacted with ordinary people from the villages of Umtata  in
the Eastern Cape. We also  went  to  the  North  West  in  Taung,  where  we
interacted with the people of the areas as well as people from Mafikeng.

This House listened and heard the plight of people.  Through  this  project,
there has been significant improvement with regard  to  problems  identified
by the Department of Home Affairs, and we need to  congratulate  our  select
committees for this excellent work.

I now come to the challenges. Achievements by this  House  are  not  without
challenges. As members of this House, our work should be outcomes-based.  In
pursuing our mandate, we need to have a plan that  will  give  direction  to
both the political component and the administration of the Council. We  need
to develop strategic objectives to guide us in our  daily  activities.  Such
strategic objectives will help us develop measurable results.

In this regard, I'm reminded  of  a  story  that  was  told  by  our  Deputy
Chairperson about a member of Parliament who, when asked, ``What is it  that
you are doing in Parliament?'', was unable to answer because we actually  do
almost everything. And those members didn't know how  much  value  they  are
adding to the work of this Parliament.

To this end the National Council  of  Provinces  has  had  its  mission  and
vision workshop. I'm convinced that through  the  collective  leadership  of
presiding officers and Whips, by next year we will have a measurable plan.

Our select committees have  recently  had  a  meaningful  strategy  planning
session to assist committees to  conceptualise  their  strategic  direction.
After the 2004 elections, which I am sure and convinced the ANC is going  to
win with a two-thirds majority, these objectives will  help  us  to  measure
what we have achieved as this august House of Parliament.

Furthermore, consideration  should  be  given  to  the  flexibility  of  our
provincial cycles. It is my view  that  provincial  cycles  are  too  rigid,
making it difficult for provinces to have maximum participation.

As members of this House, we are all aware  that  the  National  Council  of
Provinces represents the provinces to ensure that provincial  interests  are
taken into account in the national sphere of Government. But  to  this  end,
our deliberations do not quite honestly reflect some of the issues  that  we
raise in this House. An example is that of our questions to  the  executive,
which in my view do not reflect provincial issues, and we  need  to  address
that.

The House, through the work of  Committees,  should  develop  mechanisms  to
ensure that provincial interests are identified and  weighed  when  national
matters are discussed. Through oversight and legislation, our  work  in  the
NCOP  should  promote  provincial  progress.  At  times  as  this  House  we
legislate section 75 Bills with provincial implications  without  reflecting
on provincial interests. In addressing  this  problem  our  committees  must
develop a co-operative relationship with provincial committees.

This will, in certain ways, develop provincial insight on  national  matters
and  national  understanding  of  provincial  progress.  Through  this   co-
operative relationship  with  other  committees  in  the  provinces,  select
committees will ensure that provincial interests are taken into account.

In conclusion, challenges should be expected by any fledgling  organisation,
such as this one. I'm convinced that this Budget  Vote  will  help  us  deal
with these challenges.  The  ANC  supports  this  Budget  Vote.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]
Ms C-S BOTHA: Baie dankie, Voorsitter. In hierdie debat laas  jaar  het  die
Voorsitster haar uitgespreek oor die feit dat ons 89% van  die  tyd  in  die
Nasionale Raad van Provinsies - en dit geld net  soveel  vir  die  Nasionale
Vergadering - Engels gepraat het. Sy het dit so gestel: ``As ons  mense  ons
kan hoor praat in al die tale  van  die  land  sal  hulle  kan  sÃª:  `Ek  is
teenwoordig in  die  Huis'.''  Hierdie  sentiment  vind  diep  weerklank  by
diegene wat besef dat diversiteit 'n bate is vir demokrasie en nie bloot  'n
kostefaktor nie.

Ten spyte van haar versugting het ons 'n jaar later nog  nie  'n  taalbeleid
vir die Parlement nie. Pogings is wel aangewend om so iets op die  tafel  te
plaas, maar met elke vergadering word 'n nuwe  rede  aangevoer  waarom  daar
nie tot aksie oorgegaan word nie. Op die oomblik wag ons weer  'n  keer  vir
'n koste-impakstudie. Dit is  vanselfsprekend  nodig,  maar  ons  kon  reeds
begin het om sekere aspekte van die beleid te  prioritiseer  en  die  detail
daarvan uit te werk terwyl ons besig  is  met  'n  langtermyn  -  omvattende
studie.

Dit sal 'n jammerte wees as die openingsrede van die volgende Parlement  nie
in al elf tale gelyktydig uitgesaai kan  word  en  deur  die  mense  op  die
galery so gehoor kan word nie. Ek  is  seker  die  nuwe  parlementslede  sal
wonder hoekom ons dit nie tot stand kon bring nie. Daarby moet ek  voeg  dat
hierdie  Huis  die  leidende  rol  speel  in  die  toenemende  praktyk   van
veeltaligheid en dat dit 'n interessante faset van ons identiteit is.

Dit weerspieÃ«l ook die verskille in die provinsies  waar  ons  vandaan  kom.
Dit sluit aan by die deurlopende riglyn vir die Parlement om  deursigtig  en
gevoelig te wees vir die behoeftes van die kieserskorps en  om  ingestel  te
wees op dienslewering.

Ek wil nie soseer kommentaar lewer oor die gebrek al dan nie aan fondse  vir
die komitees nie. Wat my op hierdie stadium meer bekommer, is die  aard  van
die werk wat die gekose komitees toeval. Ek glo dat hierdie  komitees  -  en
dis nie deur die bank die geval nie - nie met dieselfde erns bejeÃ«n word  as
diÃ© van die Nasionale Vergadering nie.
Dikwels word wetgewing met onwelvoeglike spoed  deur  ons  komitees  gevoer.
Verhore oor wetgewing vind grootliks in die Nasionale Raad plaas.  Kyk  maar
na die twee wetsontwerpe huidiglik voor die Parlement:  die  MFM-Wetsontwerp
en die wetsontwerp oor eiendomsbelasting. Altwee  hierdie  wetsontwerpe  sal
besondere impak op plaaslike regering hÃª, maar die detail werk daaraan  word
in  die  Nasionale  Vergadering  gedoen.  Die  parlementÃªre   bestuur   moet
deurlopend na die werking van ons komitees kyk om te sien of ons  nie  beter
skakeling kan kry nie - nie net op parlementÃªre vlak nie, maar  ook  in  die
provinsies.

Een van die uitdagings vir die volgende fase  van  die  parlementÃªre  proses
sal wees om die publiek se deelname  daaraan  te  bevorder.  Dit  is  uiters
belangrik, maar nie net vir die publiek nie. ParlementariÃ«rs baat  almal  by
hierdie opvoedingsprosesse en blootstelling. Daarom dat  ek  ook  waardering
het vir die fondse wat begroot word om ons die geleenthede  te  gee  om  aan
internasionale programme deel te neem - al  het  ek  self  nog  nie  hierdie
geleentheid gehad nie.
Die begrotingspos onder bespreking het sedert 1999 tot en met  2003  met  'n
gemiddeld van 15,3% gegroei. Hierdie groei is nie eweredig te bespeur in  al
die programme van die pos nie.  As  ons  kyk  na  die  algemene  tendens  in
uitgawes vanaf 1999 tot 2006, sal ons sien dat die toekennings  aan  al  die
poste gemiddeld  meer  as  verdubbel  het  oor  hierdie  tydperk  -  behalwe
parlementÃªre salarisse.

Wat van pertinente belang is, is  die  geld  vir  ondersteuningsdienste  aan
politieke verteenwoordigers, wat ressorteer  onder  program  2.  Die  14,1%-
toename  oor  die  afgelope  vier  jaar  het  egter  grootliks  gegaan   aan
toenemende reiskoste en nie aan toenemende diens nie.

'n Interessante vraag ontstaan ook  in  verband  met  program  3,  waaronder
finansiÃ«le  ondersteuning  aan  politieke  partye  asook  kiesafdeling-   en
leiersondersteuning vir politieke partye  ressorteer.  Gaan  hierdie  fondse
nou verder verdeel word onder die ses nuwe  politieke  partye  wat  nou  tot
stand gekom het as gevolg van die oorloopwetgewing? Of gaan nuwe fondse  vir
hulle gevind word?

Program 3 het met 13,6% gegroei, maar die DA voer aan  dat  hierdie  dienste
verreweg nie genoeg is om parlementslede toe te laat om hulle  kiesafdelings
na  behore  te  dien  nie,  en  hoegenaamd  nie  genoeg   is   om   in   die
administratiewe behoeftes  van  parlementariÃ«rs  te  voorsien  nie.  Ons  is
dikwels net hoogs besoldigde administratiewe beamptes.

Ten laaste wil ek graag erkenning gee aan die gehalte leierskap wat  ons  in
hierdie Huis ervaar. Ons is egter van  mening  dat  hierdie  instansie  baie
beter erkenning deur die publiek sou geniet vir  die  eiesoortige  werk  wat
hier gedoen word as ons nie in die onbenydenswaardige posisie  was  dat  ons
bykans onherkenbaar in hierdie Raad opereer nie. Wat is ons?  Lede  van  die
Nasionale Raad van Provinsies, ja; maar wie in  die  publiek  verstaan  dit?
Vir hulle is 'n parlementslid iemand wat in die Nasionale  Vergadering  sit.
Ek dink ons het 'n nuwe  naam  nodig.  Dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Ms C-S BOTHA: Thank you very much, Chairperson. In this  debate  last  year
the Chairperson gave her opinion on the fact that 89% of  the  time  in  the
National Council of Provinces - and this applies  equally  to  the  National
Assembly - we spoke English. She put it this way: ``If our people  can  hear
us speak all the languages of the country they will be able to  say:  `I  am
present in the House.''' This sentiment finds a  wide  response  from  those
who realise that diversity is an asset to democracy and not  merely  a  cost
factor.

Despite her expressed wish, a year later we still do  not  have  a  language
policy for Parliament. Attempts have indeed been made to place something  on
the table, but at each meeting a new reason is offered why action cannot  be
taken. At the moment we are once again waiting  for  a  cost  impact  study.
Obviously this is necessary, but we could already  have  begun  prioritising
certain aspects of a policy and working out  the  detail  thereof  while  we
were busy with a long-term comprehensive study.

It will be a pity if the opening address of the next  Parliament  cannot  be
broadcast in all 11 languages simultaneously and be heard that  way  by  the
people in the gallery. I am sure that the new  members  of  Parliament  will
wonder why we could not introduce that. I must add to that that  this  House
plays a leading role in the increasing practice of multilingualism and  that
this is an interesting facet of our identity.

It also reflects the differences in the provinces from which we  come.  This
links up with the consistent guideline for Parliament to be transparent  and
sensitive to the needs of the  electorate  and  to  be  attuned  to  service
delivery.

I do not really want to comment on the lack or otherwise of  funds  for  the
committees. What concerns me more at this stage is the nature  of  the  work
which falls to the select committees. I believe that these committees -  and
it is not the case across  the  board  -  are  not  treated  with  the  same
seriousness as those of the National Assembly.

Legislation  often  passes  through  our  committees  with  improper  haste.
Hearings on legislation primarily take place in the National  Assembly.  One
can just look at the two Bills currently before  Parliament:  the  MFM  Bill
and the property tax Bill. Both these Bills will have  a  particular  impact
on local government, but the detailed work on them  is  being  done  in  the
National Assembly. The parliamentary management must look at the working  of
our committees continuously to see if we cannot have a better liaison -  not
only at the parliamentary level, but also in the provinces.

One of the challenges for the next phase of the parliamentary  process  will
be  to  promote  the  public's  participation  in  it.  This  is   extremely
important, but not only for the public. Parliamentarians  all  benefit  from
these educational processes and exposure. It is for this reason that I  also
appreciate the  funds  which  are  voted  to  give  us  the  opportunity  to
participate in international programmes - although  I  have  not  personally
had this opportunity yet.

The Vote under discussion has grown by an average of 15,3% from 1999  up  to
and including 2003. This growth cannot be detected equally through  all  the
programmes of the Vote. If we look at the general trend in expenditure  from
1999 to 2006, we will see that on average the allocations to all  the  posts
more than doubled over this period - except for parliamentary salaries.

What is of relevant  importance,  is  the  money  for  support  services  to
political representatives, which  falls  under  Programme  2.  However,  the
14,1% increase over the past four years has largely gone towards  increasing
travel costs and not to increased service.

An interesting question also  arises  with  regard  to  Programme  3,  which
contains financial support to political parties as well as constituency  and
leader support for political parties.  Are  these  funds  now  going  to  be
further divided among the six new political  parties  which  have  now  come
into being as a result  of  the  floor-crossing  legislation?  Or  will  new
funding be found for them?
Programme 3 has grown by 13,6%, but the DA contends that these services  are
by no  means  adequate  to  allow  members  of  Parliament  to  serve  their
constituencies  properly  and  are  by  no  means  adequate  to   meet   the
administrative needs of parliamentarians. We are often  merely  highly  paid
administrative officials.

In  conclusion,  I  would  like  to  recognise  the  quality  leadership  we
experience in  this  House.  However,  we  are  of  the  opinion  that  this
institution would enjoy much better recognition  from  the  public  for  the
unique work done here if we were not in  the  unenviable  position  that  in
this House we operate virtually unrecognisably. What are we? We are  members
of the National  Council  of  Provinces,  yes:  but  who  among  the  public
understands that? For them a member of parliament is  someone  who  sits  in
the National Assembly. I think we need a new name. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms B S MOHLAKA (KwaZulu-Natal): Deputy Chairperson, hon Dr G J Zuma, who  is
the Leader of Government Business, Chairperson of the  National  Council  of
Provinces, Mrs G N M Pandor, hon Members  of  the  NCOP  who  are  permanent
delegates, and special delegates from various provinces in South Africa,  it
gives me great pleasure to be afforded the  opportunity  to  participate  in
this policy debate on Budget Vote No 2.

It may be a bit difficult to make a meaningful contribution in  this  debate
as one is not a permanent delegate who is au fait with the daily  activities
and budgetary processes of Parliament and the NCOP. Therefore,  we  may  not
be on the same wavelength.

Parliamentary  debate  is  very  informative.  However,  budgeting  for  any
institution is followed  by  careful  planning,  after  mission  statements,
goals, strategic plans and priorities have been set.

There are negative factors that have affected  the  budgetary  process.  The
floor-crossing legislation, with  its  ugly  face,  has  created  a  lot  of
budgetary problems in Parliament. The individuals who have  had  to  undergo
certain metamorphosis in order to become different creatures with new  party
names,  pose  a  serious  challenge  to  budgeting  allocations  to  parties
currently represented in the National Assembly  and  provinces.  The  floor-
crossing  legislation  is  backfiring  on  the  national   Government,   the
provincial governments and the IEC, which must scramble for  funds  for  the
newly formed parties, most of  which  are  independent,  and  there  are  no
funds.

Parliament is now  robbing  Peter  in  order  to  pay  Paul:  No  wonder  it
distances itself from very  important  life-threatening  diseases,  such  as
HIV/Aids.  For  example,  purchasing  of  nevirapine  could  assist  in  the
treatment and management of HIV/Aids  for  all  our  voters  who  have  been
affected.

We were all very excited and looked forward to April 8  2003,  a  date  that
was  scheduled  for  the  signing  of  an  agreement  between  our  national
Government and the Global Fund, to a tune of R576Â million, but this did  not
happen. The money was going to help KwaZulu-Natal to fight HIV/Aids, TB  and
malaria. KwaZulu-Natal was going to benefit from the Global  Fund  following
the scientific application by  top  academics  and  practitioners  from  the
Nelson Mandela Medical School at the University  of  Natal  -  Bo  Professor
Malegapuru (Makgoba). This amount alone was going to ease the burden on  the
budgetary allocation.

All I can say is that the provinces need more  money  in  order  to  conduct
parliamentary duties effectively. We have just heard  from  the  Chairperson
of the NCOP, Mrs N Pandor, that there is overexpenditure of R22  million  by
Parliament. We therefore request an increase  on  the  parliamentary  budget
allocation.

In conclusion, it would also be appreciated if Parliament could revise  MPs'
and MPLs' salaries positively because this category of  politicians  can  be
classified as temporary workers. They are in today and out  tomorrow.  Chief
directors, deputy directors and directors of Government  departments  get  a
better reward in terms of salaries.

I am saying this because politicians work  round  the  clock.  There  is  no
proper annual leave. As it is, the NCOP is overburdened with  Bills  and  is
grossly understaffed. KwaZulu-Natal supports this  budget  debate.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I see you smiling when there is talk  about  money.
I do not know why you are smiling. OK.

Mrs N P NKONYENI (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  first  of  all  I  want  to
distance myself from the two points that my colleague has just  alluded  to,
namely the issue of floor-crossing and nevirapine. It shows which  political
party she comes from.

Thank you, Chairperson, for affording me this opportunity to participate  in
this debate.

The South African Parliament is a democratic institution  whose  mandate  is
to promulgate legislation which is nonracial, nonsexist,  and  which  unites
the diverse communities of this country. The mandate of parliamentarians  is
to play an oversight role with regard to the functions of the executive  and
other institutions which aim at enhancing our democracy.

The very first clause of  our  Freedom  Charter  says,  ``The  people  shall
govern.''  The  people  should  be  governing  by   participating   in   the
formulation of Government policies. Are we really affording our  people  the
opportunity to participate?

 I am asking this question  because  in  2001  NCOP  delegates  visited  the
mighty KwaZulu-Natal province in  order  to  disseminate  information  about
pieces of legislation that had been promulgated that  impacted  particularly
on the lives of ordinary women  in  particular.  They  were  prevented  from
participating by some undemocratic and patriarchal forces in an area  called
KwaNongoma. We compiled a report and submitted a complaint to the  Speaker's
Office in  the  National  Assembly.  No  steps  were  taken.  The  question,
therefore, is what interventional role  Parliament  should  play  when  such
conduct prevails.

I congratulate Parliament for improving the skills of  parliamentarians,  by
forging partnerships  with  other  progressive  institutions,  in  order  to
strengthen their capacity. The national gender machinery was established  in
order to empower women. We have just been informed that one of  the  pillars
of that machinery is closing down, that is  the  women's  empowerment  unit,
whose mandate is to empower women parliamentarians. The reason for  that  is
that there is no funding. To me  that  is  unacceptable,  because  we  still
expect other women to come and join the ranks of the policy-makers. How  are
they going to be capacitated?

I wish that more oversight could prevail when a budget  has  been  allocated
to provinces, especially with regard  to  the  co-ordination  of  programmes
that aim at pushing back the frontiers of poverty. I know for  a  fact  that
KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape and Limpopo are provinces  that  are  always
targeted as poor provinces  and  more  funds  are  allocated  to  them.  The
Premier of my province announced early this year that there is  no  strategy
to co-ordinate the programmes of poverty eradication in his  department.  If
the programmes are not co-ordinated, that is a problem. How does this  House
intervene in terms of capacitating the incapable?

Chairperson, I would like this province  to  look  into  the  programmes  of
development agencies, such as the IDCs, the NDAs, Umsobomvus and others.  Do
they reach our rural people who are incapable of compiling  business  plans,
which is a requirement?

Allow me to congratulate both Houses, the National Assembly  and  the  NCOP,
on a job well done. I wish that  our  public  servants  could  be  patriotic
enough to implement the good policies of our democratic country  and  adhere
to the principles of good governance and Batho Pele.

In conclusion, can I congratulate KwaZulu-Natal's permanent delegates.  They
are a useful resource to our legislature. They are visible and  they  really
do encourage public participation.

Bonke ke abavela eKapa banomehluko across political  affiliation.  Ngithatha
ke lelithuba lokubonga ngoba kuyafundiswa eKapa.  [As  for  all  the  people
from Cape Town, they differ in political affiliation. Let me then take  this
opportunity to thank them since a great deal of teaching is taking place  in
Cape Town.] Chair, I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Siyabonga.  Sozovul'
amehlo sibabuke kakhulu ke manje ngoba sowushilo. [We  thank  you.  We  will
from now on open our eyes, because you have alerted us.]

Mr T RALANE: Deputy Chairperson, hon  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,  MECs  and
special delegates, we have just been told today that if  an  institution  is
involved in an exercise called ``a cost impact  study'',  that  is  just  an
excuse. I think that all of us who today are speaking about the  Budget  and
budgeting know that this is the most  appropriate  action  to  undertake  in
whatever you are going to do.

In the same breath, as you move away from the CBD of every town,  one  party
has huge placards that say, `` Put  150  000  policeman  and  women  on  the
streets'', and I assume that has not been costed. Clearly,  having  150  000
policeman and women on the beat has not been costed.

Secondly, it is also incorrect to say - I am  informed  about  this  -  that
funding for our own committees is insufficient. In  fact,  the  issues  that
you are talking about, the business plans  and  other  issues,  are  matters
that are going to strengthen oversight and accountability.

The other matter that was raised, which I think is a constitutional  matter,
namely funding for the additional parties that have been formed as a  result
of  floor  crossing,  is  going  to  be  addressed  in  terms  of  our   own
Constitution in the country. But I think  comrade  Nkonyi  has  assisted  me
regarding the matter of HIV/Aids, because that also  is  a  matter  that  we
must look into as we talk about all these other matters.

It is a privilege to address  this  august  House  on  the  Budget  Vote  of
Parliament. This Budget Vote debate must be understood in a  wider  context.
It must be held in the  context  of  interactions  between  Parliament,  the
executive and the citizens of the country.

Moreover, the debate on this Budget Vote cannot stop here. The role of  this
Parliament has ramifications for us, our  neighbouring  states  in  Southern
Africa and even beyond. The new wave of democracy on  our  continent,  which
is evidenced by the hosting  of  multiparty  presidential  or  parliamentary
elections in many African states since the 1990s,  presents  new  challenges
to  our  national  and  continental   institutional   designs.   These   are
manifestations of the fresh winds blowing across our continent.

The successful closure of the OAU and the beginning  of  the  AU  are  often
viewed as  linkages  or  mirror  images  of  our  own  successful  political
transition. This perception is not unmindful of the new challenges  awaiting
our attention.
But the point has to be made, in no  uncertain  terms,  that  South  Africa,
together  with  partner  African  governments,  has   provided   continental
leadership. The continental role played by our President places the role  of
our national Parliament within a new democracy, under a new  microscope  and
will serve as a benchmark for African states. I wish to locate the  role  of
our national Parliament within this extended focus and, of  course,  such  a
focus will be appropriate since we  have  just  celebrated  Africa  Day,  on
Sunday, 25 May 2003.

Our national fiscus has stabilised, with a  set  of  macroeconomic  policies
having  been  introduced,  consolidated  and  largely   implemented.   South
Africa's global message remains the crucial one, that racial  diversity  and
harmony in general are attainable.

South  Africa's  stature  is  supported  by  its  positive  and  potentially
stabilising role, especially  given  its  relative  political  and  economic
giantism. South Africa accounts for 45% of the GDP  of  all  of  sub-Saharan
Africa and for 75% of that of the 14 members of the SADC region.

South African business is the largest single investor  in  the  SADC  region
and South Africa remains the major FDI investor in Africa as  a  whole,  and
has not been the recipient  of  much  of  the  world's  investment.  Foreign
Direct Investment into Africa is roughly about 4,8% of flows  to  developing
countries.

While there is a need to establish the conditions necessary  for  attracting
local  and  foreign  investment  to  Africa,  governance  issues  cannot  be
overlooked. The role of Parliament and commitment to transparency  and  good
governance come under scrutiny. We must beware of  a  simplistic  review  of
governance. Governance is not only about things Government must do, such  as
holding regular elections, effective administration and securing  peace  and
security, but also means that Government must do things in ways  that  allow
people to believe that they have a stake in Government and governance.
Governance is not  only  about  representivity  and  legitimacy.  These  are
essential, but governance is most importantly  about  being  accountable  to
the citizens. While governance is  about  exercising  political  power,  the
need to be accountable to citizens is indispensable. The point  to  be  made
here  is  that  politics  is  as  important  to  successful  development  as
economics.

For far too long governance was viewed only in terms  of  economic  progress
and administrative efficiency, as if these are the only components  of  good
governance. Good governance requires the establishment and strengthening  of
institutions able to hold the executive  and  individuals  to  account.  Our
national Parliament and the African  Parliament  have  this  responsibility.
The success of our national Parliament in this regard could have  spill-over
effects on the African Parliament, since the success of  the  African  Union
and its appendages is linked to our own successful transition.

As a member of the Joint Budget Committee, one of  the  questions  we  often
raise is: To what extent does this  Budget  Vote  2  and  the  resources  it
distributes reflect the policy decision taken by the  democratic  forces?  A
budget is a critical tool for oversight. To determine whether it is good  or
bad depends on the extent to which it addresses our objectives.

The Parliament Vote No 2 and its outcomes is the test of  our  achievements.
National Parliament has, for example, introduced 85 Bills  and  produced  69
Acts, and, most importantly, hosted many public hearings.

Besides   being   transparent,   our   Parliament   develops   and   pursues
democratically  a  legislative  agenda  which  is  commensurate   with   the
objectives of the  progressive  forces  supporting  transformation  in  this
country.  The  progressive  outcome  and  content  of  our  legislation,  in
essence, is the real test of the  outcomes  of  this  national  institution.
National Parliament has implemented our policy  choices  in  a  manner  that
holds this institution accountable to the people we serve.

The ANC supports the budget. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Deputy Chairperson, I would like  to  begin  by
thanking the Deputy President for the contribution  that  he  made.  We  had
indication earlier of the schedule of the Deputy President and  we  knew  he
would leave before we concluded this debate. But I was very happy  that  the
Leader of Government Business was able to be here and to make  some  of  the
important points that he has about the work of the Council. I am  sure  many
of you will recognise that some of what the Deputy President said  certainly
accorded  with  a  number  of  issues  we  have  been  discussing  recently,
especially with respect to strengthening our partnership with the  organised
local government. It is one of the areas that we must take up.

I have got to say that certainly with respect to the  hon  Van  Niekerk,  we
must give him the Chair from time to time to allow that firm humorous  voice
to emerge from the Chair. I hope that we are going to proceed to  make  real
the intention of our conference on multiligualism which was hosted  by  this
Parliament. I think it will be an important initiative and it  is  certainly
something that we should look at.

In terms of efficiency, I have also been concerned about it and I  think  it
raises a number of  questions  about  levels  of  support,  the  ability  to
execute decisions and so on.  I  think  we  tend  to  be  fairly  shy  about
ensuring that we have adequate strategic  support,  perhaps  as  Parliament,
but more particularly as the presiding officers. It is an area that we  need
to strengthen.

We also need to see far more follow up  from  staff.  I  think  it  is  very
difficult for politicians and presiding officers to be implementing  agents.
It is more the management that should play that role. The reference  I  made
earlier to the unavailability of the annual report up to today is  a  strong
indicator of what I would call a problem of efficient delivery. So  clearly,
there is an area there that needs to be addressed.

Certainly, regarding the matters of public participation and  interpretation
facilities, they are aspects we must give attention to; I agree  with  that.
But I thought, hon Van Niekerk, you would  praise  me  for  my  multilingual
skills.

Ke bua Setswana, SeXhosa, le Seesimane. Ke ne ke di bua tsotlhe kwa Taung  e
bile ke gopola gore o tlaa ba bolelela jalo.  [I  speak  Setswana,  isiXhosa
and English. I spoke all of them in Taung and I thought that you  will  tell
them so.]

Also thanks to the Chairperson of  Committees  for  the  contributions  that
have been made. I am very excited about the visioning that both  the  Deputy
Chairperson and the Chairperson of Committees have referred to,  namely  the
strategic intent of the National Council of Provinces and focused  attention
we wish to give to our mandate and ensuring that  we  execute  it.  I  think
this is very exciting.

Hon Botha, I think there is nothing that constrains the  committees  of  the
National Council of Provinces with regard to holding  public  hearings.  The
fact is, where do they do this? And in my view,  we  should  be  looking  at
partnerships with the provincial legislatures and public  hearings  at  that
level, because we are not getting to the provinces  on  a  number  of  these
pieces of legislation. Certainly, it is something I believe  the  committees
must look into, now  that  more  adequate  financial  support  and  planning
expertise has been provided to committees.

I  am  concerned  about  the  inadequacy  of  time  to  address  section  76
legislation. Members who were in the Programme Committee  would  have  heard
this morning that I have indicated that any new section 76 Bills  which  are
introduced in the National Assembly, clearly, we will not have time to  deal
with because we must be true to our mandate to ensure  that  provinces  have
sufficient time to consider concurrent legislation.

Regarding section 75 Bills, we will deal with that as  per  the  requirement
in terms of procedure and constitutional mandate. But concerning section  76
Bills, if indeed we believe  that  our  task  of  ensuring  that  provincial
interest is accommodated and represented in this House,  we  cannot  neglect
our duty  to  then  fully  consult  provincial  legislatures  that  are  the
representatives of the voice of the people at provincial level. So  I  think
we need to be more strict in this regard and, as the  hon  Van  Niekerk  has
said, we will be strict on that particular question.

With respect to the constituency office funds, I think  members  must  begin
to make submissions as political parties to the Joint  Rules  Committees  on
this question. If there are inadequacies, let us  make  proper  submissions.
Let us indicate how we use them. Part of the problem is that  as  Parliament
we do not get  reports  from  political  parties  on  how  the  constituency
programme is executed, even at the programme level, without  other  details.
And so, in order to justify increased expenditure  in  this  area,  I  think
there has to be far more of an accountability mechanism put  in  place.  But
it is something that political parties certainly could raise.

Regarding the new parties and funding for them, we have Rules. In  terms  of
the Rules of the National Assembly, which primarily is affected by this,  we
do provide party funding support to political party leaders. Certainly,  the
new leaders of the newly formed parties I suppose  will  have  to  be  given
attention in terms of that procedural aspect which is  part  of  our  policy
and part of our Rules. I am in the fortunate position that I don't  have  to
face this question in the National Council of Provinces because  we  go  for
stability, and that's what we have here.

I would think that in terms of the notion, the concept and term  ``permanent
delegation'' and  all  the  other  terminology  used  with  respect  to  the
National Council of Provinces, again we have mechanisms. The  constitutional
review process occurs every year. I have not seen a single  political  party
making a submission about changing aspects of the Constitution which  relate
to the National Council of Provinces. Certainly, we are open to doing that.

With regard to the hon member who made comments  on  HIV/Aids  and  KwaZulu-
Natal and this Parliament not being  active  on  HIV/Aids,  I  am  afraid  I
couldn't quite understand  the  place  of  that  in  terms  of  the  debate.
Certainly, in our Social Development Committee,  the  one  that  focuses  on
health matters, we have sought to find out exactly  what  the  situation  is
with respect to HIV/Aids in our country. We've looked at what has been  done
with respect to the  provision  of  Nevirapine  and  in  which  clinics  and
hospitals this is done across the country. We  have  debated  and  examined,
through questions and other procedures, the whole  policy  with  respect  to
confronting the pandemic in South Africa.

If the colleague is referring to the  province  not  being  active  in  this
area, we must be told so and this is an aspect that we will  investigate.  I
had hoped that perhaps, given the reference to policy areas,  the  colleague
might perhaps have told us a little bit about what  we  heard  in  the  news
this morning, that the bulk and  majority  of  children  who  are  poor  and
hungry in our country are in the province of KwaZulu-Natal.

Despite the fact that, through the provisions of the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission, we do make allocations of conditional expenditure  that  provide
for social support in that area, we do, in fact, have under-registration  of
children  who  should  be  receiving  social  grants.  We  would  want   the
provincial legislature to assist us in understanding why this  is  the  case
and how the legislature - the public  representatives  -  will  respond  and
change the dire circumstances of children in that province.

I think this is where our oversight work should be occurring, and  certainly
from this House, I will be  asking  that  we  give  attention  to  what  was
reported with respect to children and their access  to  social  grants;  not
just in KwaZulu-Natal. All they said was that the majority who are  reported
as being hungry emanate as underaged children from that province.

But I think it is a national phenomenon that we need to give  attention  to,
province to province, so that we have a  proper  report  from  each  of  the
delegations on what we are doing with respect to assuring that children  who
are poor have  access  to  the  Child  Support  Grant,  and  that  they  are
receiving the supported funding that Government has put in  place  in  order
to provide help.

On Parliament adjusting  the  salaries  of  MPs  and  MPLs,  I'm  always  so
pleased, in fact, that Parliament is removed from deciding  on  salaries  of
members and I think that as  public  representatives  we  need  to  remember
this. This is  all  decided  through  a  commission  on  remuneration  -  an
independent body - which makes recommendations to  the  President  who  then
either accepts or rejects the recommendations.

Finally, an area that I think we need to give much more scrutiny to  and  to
work on more assiduously, somewhat related to a number of  the  points  that
you made reference to. We should give more careful thought to the  question:
What does provincial interest mean? I've been saying  this  since  I  joined
this House as a Deputy Chairperson in 1998, and I'm  wondering  why  we  are
unable to really determine what is meant by  provincial  interest.  I  think
for me some of it means being be to know if we have a national  policy  that
says, as follows, ``that we provide pensions to those who are over sixty  in
our country''.

We as this House would have to establish, on a  fairly  carefully  tabulated
basis, whether all persons who are sixty or over,  who  pass  a  means  test
have access to  the  social  pension.  If  they  don't,  we  would  need  to
establish why? If the reason lies in the activity of  a  national  executive
member, we would be able to pose questions and queries here. If  the  reason
lies in the provincial part of our country failing to execute  its  mandate,
we would feed that provincial interest matter into  the  legislatures  where
the MPLs must then act.

But we sometimes behave as though we are unable to understand that.  Surely,
provincial interest has to mean that synergy between ourselves as  national,
provincial and local governments needs to be synthesised into a response  to
the interests of our people.

We are not here merely to listen to ourselves. We are  here  to  change  our
country. We are here for cost-effective  impact,  hon  Ralane.  I  like  the
term. ``Cost-effective impact'' - I think you  were  saying  -  is  what  we
should seek, and I believe we as the National Council  of  Provinces  should
begin to reach towards that.

I agree absolutely with hon Ralane that  without  good  governance,  we  can
forget development. We have got to learn  on  our  continent  that  we  must
pursue good governance. Associated with it is democracy, accountability  and
transparency. Once we have those, we will have a continent rich in success.

Thank you to all hon members once more, and  I  am  pleased  to  enjoy  your
support for our budget. I hope that it will  deliver  the  results  that  we
seek. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 29 - Housing

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Deputy Chair, hon members,  my  presentation  today
to this august House follows a hot debate sparked by  my  budget  speech  to
the National Assembly a week ago. Topping the debate is the  critical  issue
of the availability of housing  finance  to  the  historically  marginalised
groups in our country. However,  it  would  be  very  disappointing  if  the
debate could overshadow the important issue of accelerating the delivery  of
quality housing to the poor communities of our country.

Indeed the vulnerable of our society,  particularly  women,  older  persons,
people with disabilities and people infected with and affected by  HIV/Aids,
should remain the main beneficiaries of our  housing  subsidy  grant.  These
vulnerable sections of our populace should, more than ever before, see  that
the Government is indeed taking bold steps to make  them  masters  of  their
own destinies.

Our aim is to build solid  homes  and  help  in  the  building  of  thriving
communities while at the same time trying to reverse the  apartheid  spatial
development patterns that we have inherited. In  doing  this,  we  ought  to
reach out and mobilise nongovernmental  and  community-based  organisations,
private sector partners and the beneficiaries themselves  so  that  we  face
these challenges as a collective. Critical to  this  is  the  need  for  all
stakeholders to begin to play their respective  roles  in  the  delivery  of
housing to our people.

I take this opportunity to thank all the  stakeholders  who  have  travelled
the nine years journey with us to help us realise  our  goal  of  delivering
more than 1,5 million houses to the poor.  I  also  thank  hon  members  for
their continued support of the housing policy and programme.

As hon members might be aware, our  provinces  have  been  confronted  by  a
number of challenges in  the  past  nine  years  of  housing  delivery.  The
tendering process, particularly at municipal level, is still a  problem.  We
have  found  that  the  capacity  of  local   authorities   and   provincial
governments to implement the new  procurement  regime  introduced  in  April
2002 is expected to take a while to develop. This  means  that  the  current
approval rate of housing projects is most likely to  decline  from  previous
levels.

The scarcity of land, mainly as a result of costs, differ from  province  to
province and land claims that have been  lodged  in  various  municipalities
still need  our  full  attention.  Provincial  departments  of  housing  are
continuously grappling with the problem of being unable to finalise  housing
subsidy applications on  the  grounds  of  outstanding  or  unresolved  land
claims. However, we have not been able to  establish  exactly  how  many  of
these outstanding land claims are really stalling the  approval  of  housing
subsidy applications received by provinces, nor do we know the exact  number
of existing unapproved housing subsidy applications  as  a  result  of  this
problem.

Owing to the legacy of apartheid and massive insecurity of  tenure,  it  has
also  been  difficult  to  reach  the  expected  annual  provincial  housing
delivery targets. The issue of  tenure  securitisation  has  also  become  a
complex process, which makes it impossible  for  provincial  departments  of
housing  to  fast-track  the  approval   of   subsidy   applications.   What
complicates this process is the multiplicity  of  tenure  legislation,  with
often cumbersome, costly and complicated procedural requirements.

The availability of land for housing  purposes  in  tribal  areas  has  also
emerged as one of  the  critical  issues  behind  the  2002-2003  provincial
underspending of the financial  allocation  for  housing.  The  most  common
explanation is that some tribal authorities are not  willing  to  forgo  the
powers  they  have  in  respect  of  land  allocation,  administration   and
management.

However,  from  informal  discussions  that  our  officials  had  with   the
institutions of traditional authorities, it has emerged that at the core  of
the problem is the issue of governance  as  a  whole,  which  includes  both
political  and  economic  considerations.  In  other  words,  the   inherent
differences between  the  pre-  and  postmodern  South  Africa's  system  of
governance have been cited as contributing to  the  current  nonavailability
of tribal land for housing purposes.

We hope that the draft  discussion  document  on  the  role  of  traditional
authorities in governance that was produced by the Department of  Provincial
and Local Government will help to sort out this problem, as soon  as  it  is
finalised.

The implementation of the National Environmental Management Act of 1998  has
also been found to contribute to the delays and the  implementation  of  our
projects.  This  Act  requires  the  compilation  of  environmental   impact
assessments to show the impact that  any  planned  development  intervention
would have on the environment and its people.  Most  provincial  departments
of housing have cited this requirement as a hindrance to  housing  delivery.
Part of the explanation relates to the time  taken  and  costs  involved  in
compiling each environmental impact assessment report.

In Gauteng, for example, where this matter affected a major portion  of  the
expenditure, intraprovincial intervention had to  be  made  at  the  highest
level to deal with interpretation  problems  by  the  provincial  department
responsible for management of the environmental legislation.

Bridging finance to smaller and emerging contractors is still  a  constraint
with regard to the delivery of  housing.  The  guarantees  provided  by  the
National Urban Reconstruction and Housing Agency and  the  finance  provided
by smaller specialised banks do  assist  in  this  regard  but  need  to  be
strengthened and linked to the Department of Housing's  Emerging  Contractor
Programme. More importantly, NURCHA has  managed  to  assist  more  than  30
women projects, nationally, with finance. The total value of these  projects
is R77 million, and the women were guaranteed by NURCHA to the tune of  more
than R16 million. However, in total, when one considers all the  initiatives
towards unlocking access to finance  by  women,  NURCHA  has  been  able  to
facilitate more than R500 million to women in the past nine years.

From April 2002  the  National  Housing  Finance  Corporation  has  approved
facilities  totalling  R2  million  and   disbursed   R43Â million   to   the
beneficiaries.

However, inadequate private sector finance continues  to  constrain  housing
delivery and access to quality housing.  As  I  mentioned  in  the  National
Assembly, I hope the introduction of the Community  Reinvestment  Bill  will
contribute to the flow of credit to developers and housing consumers.  Allow
me, though, to reiterate that particular attention is  being  given  to  the
provinces underspending, especially those that are  not  in  this  situation
for the first time.

It is encouraging to note that at least 9,3 million  people  have  benefited
from the 1,5 million houses that we have  built  and  that  400  000  former
municipal homes have been transferred in the past nine years  to  their  new
owners.

Of these houses, Eastern Cape has delivered 218 780;  Free  State  108  155;
Gauteng 387 409; KwaZulu-Natal 245 295; Mpumalanga 105Â 065; Northen Cape  33
799; Limpopo 100 314; North West and  Western  Cape  125  353  and  167  368
respectively. Thus our efforts, which included  subsidy  increases  in  line
with inflation rates, have served to intensify  our  responses  to  reducing
homelessness among our people.

One of the most critical areas of our work this year will be to  consolidate
our strategy of  empowering  the  historically  marginalised  entrepreneurs,
especially women, and help to facilitate  the  establishment  of  small  and
medium enterprises in the industry.  We  will  do  this,  among  others,  by
intensifying  the  enforcement  of  the  10%  quota  set  aside  for   women
contractors in the  provincial  allocations.  We  will  do  this  with  full
appreciation of the work already done in other provinces that  have  managed
to meet and even exceed this quota.

Our records, though, indicate that about R850 million from  the  past  eight
years' budget was allocated to women  contractors  in  the  nine  provinces.
This constitutes only about 3,9% of the provincial allocations  since  1994.
This figure needs to be urgently improved if we are to  meet  our  objective
in this regard.

Quality in housing goes hand in glove with the ability to diversify  housing
options and the right to beneficiaries to select the type  of  housing  that
will  adequately  address  their  needs.  We  have  already  announced   our
intentions to intensify  the  strategy  for  the  densification  of  certain
residential  areas  to  optimally  utilise  scarcely  available   land   and
infrastructure and to provide the  growing  demand  for  rental  housing  in
heavily populated urban provinces.

My department is in the process of developing a comprehensive  strategy  for
the undertaking of medium-density housing development in inner  city  areas.
The programme will cater for new developments as well as  the  refurbishment
or conversion of existing buildings. The programme will  also  cater  for  a
variety of design models with  various  levels  of  finishing  to  suit  the
widest range of affordability levels.

The current institutional housing subsidy programme will,  in  the  process,
be  evaluated  to  determine  its  suitability  for   the   future   housing
development approach. The finalisation of the proposals  regarding  this  is
expected by August.

The aforementioned Medium Density Housing Development  Programme  is  linked
to the Government's initiative  to  establish  and  operationalise  adequate
sustainable  housing  institutions  to  undertake  the  said  medium-density
housing development projects. The Social Housing Bill is also being  drafted
to support medium-density housing and will  be  tabled  in  Parliament  this
year.
Let me now refer to the Presidential  Job  Summit  held,  as  you  know,  in
October 1998.  The  Government,  private  sector  and  labour  organisations
resolved that there is a need for a National Presidential  Lead  Project  on
Rental  Housing  at  sufficient  scale  to  pilot  affordable  mass  housing
delivery and an alternative form of tenure, especially rental  housing.  The
Presidential Pilot Project on Rental Housing was then conceived  to  provide
50 000 rental units in three phases over multiple financial years.

The Government has approved the institutional and  financial  models  to  be
used  in  the  implementation  of  the  programme  to  pave  the   way   for
implementation of the projects. This agreement facilitated  the  appointment
of the National Housing Finance Corporation as the management agent for  the
programme.

The three projects selected for the first phase of  the  Presidential  Pilot
Project on Rental Housing are in various stages of  implementation.  Of  the
three,  Johannesburg,  notably  the  Kliptown   subproject,   and   Witbank,
eMalahleni, have already completed their show units. These show  units  will
serve the dual  purpose  of  physically  launching  the  Presidential  Pilot
Project on Rental Housing and to  further  enhance  the  end-user  processes
such as unit selection based on individual affordability. You know that  the
first pilot project for Gauteng was indeed  launched  by  the  President  at
Fordsburg last year.

I want to turn to housing finance. In order to ensure a  better  quality  of
life for all South Africans, we will continue to monitor the  activities  of
the home-building industry to ensure the  transformation  of  the  industry,
through our Constitution and all other relevant pieces of legislation.

Despite the efforts we are making to try and provide affordable  housing  to
the poor, we still have to ensure  that  all  the  stakeholders  effectively
play their respective roles in this regard. Our records reveal that only  35
759 of the 1,5 million houses  built  by  the  Government  since  1994  were
partially financed  by  the  financial  institutions  through  credit.  This
constitutes only 2,8% of the total.

The reality is that we still have millions of people who are  so  poor  that
they cannot acquire their housing without any external assistance. It is  in
this context that we feel access to finance remains the  greatest  challenge
to low-cost housing development. The  Government  is  therefore  obliged  to
create  the  necessary  environment  to  address  this  situation,  and  the
restructuring of the financial sector is a necessary priority.

As part of this restructuring, we promulgated the  Home  Loan  and  Mortgage
Disclosure Act in 2000, and the Community Reinvestment Bill is  sure  to  be
passed into law during the course of this year. Whereas  the  first  Act  is
merely for financial  institutions  to  disclose  certain  information,  the
Community Reinvestment Bill provides  for  actual  targets  which  financial
institutions  will  have  to  meet  in  complying   with   their   community
reinvestment obligations.
The Bill, like the Home Loan and Mortgage Disclosure  Act,  makes  provision
for financial institutions to be rated on their  performance.  The  targets,
however, will be set after consultation with  the  relevant  stakeholders  -
and I want to repeat  that  -  including  the  financial  institutions.  The
process for the establishment of the  Office  of  the  Disclosure  has  been
initiated and is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.

As part of broadening access to housing finance, we are currently trying  to
inculcate  the  culture  of  savings  in  the  housing  beneficiaries.  This
campaign has already  yielded  positive  results  since  the  programme  was
launched by Deputy President Zuma in 2001.

The National Urban Reconstruction and  Housing  Agency,  NURCHA,  has  since
managed to mobilise 39 315 savers from the seven provinces that  the  agency
has managed to penetrate. KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng have the highest  number
of savers, with over 16 000 and 11 000  respectively.  Free  State  and  the
Northern Cape are still to introduce the programme.
As part of further enhancing the programme, my department is at an  advanced
stage with regard to the development of  a  savings-linked  housing  subsidy
scheme that will further assist beneficiaries to  save  their  contributions
in a structured, dedicated and well-managed way. It is  envisaged  that  the
scheme will be introduced during the coming months or so.

Let me just give you a sense of provincial  allocations:  Eastern  Cape  has
R641,757 million; Free State R325,403 million;  Gauteng  R923,892;  million;
KwaZulu-Natal R796,390 million; Mpumalanga R274,408 million;  Northern  Cape
R85,973 million; Limpopo R426,160 million; North-West R347,974  million  and
Western Cape R423,282 million. I thank you, Madam Chair. That's the  end  of
my contribution. [Applause.]

follows.)

[Mr V V Z WINDVOÐL: Mr Chairperson, Minister of Housing, Mrs B  S  Mabandla,
provincial housing Ministers who are here, and hon members, I would like  to
start off by congratulating the hon Minister Mabandla on her appointment  as
the leader of the Department of Housing.

We are hopeful that as she follows in the footsteps  of  Comrade  Joe  Slovo
and the stalwart of our organisation, Comrade Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele,  she
will, as a mother, make an invaluable contribution towards the  building  of
houses for the citizens of South Africa.]
It is in that spirit that we welcome the Budget policy  speech  of  the  hon
Minister  and  support  the  passing  of  this  Budget  Vote,  in  order  to
consolidate and expand the delivery of affordable  housing  and  shelter  to
the homeless.

Since the inception  of  our  democratic  Government  in  1994,  significant
strides have been taken towards normalising the housing environment,  moving
away  from  the  fragmented  nature  of  housing  delivery   to   developing
integrated housing. As we move towards the end of the  second  term  of  our
democratic dispensation, over R18 billion has  been  spent  by  the  ANC-led
Government in creating  millions  of  housing  opportunities.  Thousands  of
permanent and temporary jobs were created either directly or indirectly.

This translates into a positive socioeconomic  impact  on  our  communities,
particularly the poorest of the poor. It is true that the Ministry  and  the
department are playing their role as an integral part of  pushing  back  the
frontiers  of  poverty.  Never  again  shall  we  talk  about  99-year-lease
schemes, racially based and sexually discriminating housing  schemes,  which
left the majority of our people out in the cold, oppressed,  suppressed  and
depressed.

Typical of any nation in transformation, traversing such a  road  cannot  be
without  obstacles  and  challenges.  In  a  move  to  transform  the  legal
framework which resulted in skewed participation in the housing sector,  the
following progressive pieces of legislation,  amongst  others,  were  passed
into law:  The  first  to  be  mentioned  is  the  Home  Loan  and  Mortgage
Disclosure Act of 2000, which provides for the establishment of  the  Office
of  Disclosure,  thus  compelling   financial   institutions   to   disclose
information and identify discriminatory lending patterns.

The second one is the Housing Consumers Protection  Measures  Act  of  1988,
which requires residential builders to register with the  NHBRC.  Those  who
don't know what NHBRC stands for, like Mr Tolo,  it  is  the  National  Home
Builders Registration Council. ... [Laughter.] It obliges them to enrol  all
new houses under the NHBRC defect warranty scheme. The aim of the act is  to
protect home  owners  from  inferior  workmanship.  Our  committee  is  also
looking forward to the formal tabling of the Social Housing Bill.

One other challenge facing the department and the country at  large  is  the
unscrupulous,  fly-by-night  contractors  and  certain  officials  bent   on
corrupt  and  fraudulent  means  of  making  a  quick  buck.   Such   unholy
collaboration has led, in other instances, to contractors being  fully  paid
while leaving behind shoddy and incomplete projects.

While  condemning  these  unpatriotic  nincompoops  who   don't   have   the
development of their fellow citizens at heart,  we  must,  however,  commend
those contractors who have done  their  work  with  excellence  and  equally
salute the officials who are honest to the principle of Batho Pele.

The Government should not be seen as the sole role-player in  the  provision
of housing. Financial institutions have a great role to  play  in  providing
affordable housing to the citizens of the country, from which they  rake  in
so much profits. Their discriminatory policy of redlining  has  resulted  in
the red-carding or simply the denial of housing opportunities  to  thousands
of citizens because they  found  themselves  living  or  residing  in  areas
classified as high risk areas or at times prejudiced as noncreditworthy.  It
is in this context that we welcome the Ministry's legislative  proposals  to
overcome these redlining obstacles. On a lighter note, we may as  well  move
to green lining, in terms of  which  everybody  would  be  given  access  to
housing opportunities ... [Interjections.]

Gauteng 52,1%; Eastern Cape 44,2%; Mpumalanga  32,9%;  KwaZulu-Natal  20,4%;
North West 6,4%. (Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[Ladies and gentlemen, sons and daughters of Mbandzeni who  ran  around  the
Lubombo mountain to its end, it is painful to note that even today we  still
have people who fall victim to midnight winter snow, exposed to cold  winter
rains and chilled to the marrow for lack of  housing  while  some  provinces
still have billions of rands in  roll-over  funds.  According  to  the  IGFR
report from National Treasury, those districts are as follows - in the 2002-
03 financial year: Gauteng 52,1%;  Eastern  Cape  44,2%;  Mpumalanga  32,9%;
KwaZulu-Natal 20,4%; North West 6,4%.]

Other members will also reflect  on  this  unacceptable  scenario  of  roll-
overs, and we hope that the R13 billion plus which is budgeted for the  next
three MTEF years will not fall prey to this roll-over game too.

Integrating  land  and  housing  delivery  will  go  a  long   way   towards
deracialising our human  settlements,  thus  consolidating  nonracialism  as
embodied in the Constitution. We are eagerly waiting  for  the  introduction
of and passage of the Communal Land Bill  which  will  remove  some  of  the
obstacles to accelerated housing delivery in the rural areas.

Housing delivery involves all three spheres of government. However, we  must
say  that  the  realignment  of  local  municipalities,  coupled  with   the
compilation and adoption of IDPs, comes as an advantage towards  a  holistic
approach.

Let me also warn our local municipalities to guard against big  business  or
developers lobbying the local councils for purchase of land, and then  build
houses and sell them at exorbitant prices. In the long term this will  haunt
us, because as the population grows, these municipalities may have  no  land
available for human settlement as it is also made accessible  to  those  who
live beyond the poverty line.

Furthermore, experience has shown that if  beneficiaries  either  build  the
houses themselves or organise to build houses on their own, they  can  build
better houses as they can save on labour costs and also avoid having to  pay
the profit element being charged by developers.

In conclusion, may I wish the department well in expanding the provision  of
housing, including social housing,  the  People's  Housing  Process,  rental
housing, rural housing for rural people and agricultural  villages,  and  in
ensuring proper living conditions for our farm workers. I  have  spoken.  We
support the passage of this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr G E NKWINTI (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson, hon members of this  House
and the hon Minister, we  always  cherish  the  honour  of  addressing  this
august body. Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute briefly to  one  of
our greatest revolutionaries and liberation struggle heroes, the  late  Tata
Walter Sisulu, and say that he was awesomely humble and his contribution  to
our liberation is unfathomable. How I wish I could be like him.

Mhlalingaphambili,  akukho  nto  ephoxa  nedanisa  njengokungachithi   imali
kwezezindlu abantu bekhona, befuna izindlu. Ndifuna  ukuqinisekisa  le  Ndlu
okokuba leyo yinto engalalisi buthongo  bumnandi,  ngoba  kaloku  singabantu
abahleli phakathi kwabantu abafuna izindlu.

Xa udibanisa le mali echazwe apha ngumphathiswa, ezi  zigidi  ziyi-R641,  ze
uyidibanise nemali ebesifanelwe  kukuba  sibe  siyichithile,  kodwa  yasala,
njengoko  ilungu  elihloniphekileyo  lisitsho,  ngakumbi  xa  iNdlu  yoWiso-
Mthetho ibingasivumela ze sixhaswe nayile Ndlu, iyonke  ziibhiliyoni  eziyi-
R1,1. Loo  nto  ke  siyibona  njengomngeni  omkhulu  lowo.  (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, there is nothing as disappointing as underspending on  housing
when there are so many people who need houses. I want to assure  this  House
that that causes sleepless nights, because we live  among  people  who  want
houses.

If you add the amount mentioned by  the  Minister,  R641  million,  and  the
amount we were supposed to have spent that  was  rolled  over,  as  the  hon
member indicated, we could spend a total of R1,1  billion,  particularly  if
supported by the National Assembly and this House. We consider  that  a  big
challenge.]

It will require a combination of speed, scale and quality. We have to  spend
at a rate of R6 million a day, with the exception of Sundays.  This  is  the
reality of the challenge of housing delivery in the Eastern Cape province.

Critical to the success of  this  project  is  a  number  of  factors:  one,
collaboration. We had to effect major reorganisation in the housing  section
of the department. We have had  to  collaborate  with  municipalities,  with
material suppliers, the Department  of  Labour,  training  institutions  and
contractors on a turn-around strategy in the  project  plan.  This  we  have
done.

Two, major internal reorganisation has had  to  take  place,  including  the
contracting of nine project managers and a release of 45 staff members  from
their routine office duties so that they could provide field support to  the
contractors,  municipalities  and  the  project  managers  with  respect  to
administrative, technical and financial  challenges  on  the  spot.  In  our
view, this is a challenge we can meet,  working  together  with  the  people
that we team up with.

The R1,1 billion translates into 60 000 serviced sites, which require of  us
to put up top structures. This is the  reason  we  think  we  can  meet  the
challenge, because we have built this serviced stock of 60 000. We now  have
to build top structures. But, of course, critical to this, we also  have  to
look at the question of equity and balance that with quantity.  To  do  that
we have had to divide the 60 000 sites between the emerging and  established
contractors at the ratio of 50:50. Twenty  percent  of  these  sites  go  to
women in construction in our province, which is a very strong  component  of
housing delivery there.

I could just say that the year before last the province of the Eastern  Cape
spent 94% of its budget. The following year we had  the  scenario  that  the
hon member referred to: We spent just over 80%. I will say boldly here  that
part of the challenge was to ensure that we build  a  strong  small,  medium
and micro entrepreneurial base in the province. Women in construction are  a
very strong component of that, as well as  young  people.  We  have  had  to
train these people. We think that we have made a turnaround.

The fact that we were able to spend 80% of our budget  last  year,  up  from
39%, speaks for itself. And we are proud to say that even as we speak  there
are people who are busy  preparing  for  an  assault  on  this  60  000  top
structures in the province. We  are  confident  that  we  will  make  a  big
impact.

We collaborated with partners in putting together a 51-weeks  project  plan,
from 1 June 2003 to 1 March 2004, with specific time lines  and  milestones.
We have worked together on this over the past three to four weeks. With  all
these stakeholders, we think that we will succeed.

There  are  threats,  though,  to  the  success  of  the  plan.  They   are:
institutional drags, co-ordinational issues (when  you  have  such  as  huge
number of people collaborating on one big  project);  failure  to  stick  to
agreed deliverables; ignoring the centrality of the beneficiary  because  of
the People's Housing Process, and lack of political will  to  do  the  right
thing, which is one big challenge often ignored by most of us.

We have consensus  with  partners  on  the  turn-around  strategy.  We  have
collaborated  on  drafting  the  project  plan   and   we   have   radically
restructured our housing administration section, making it more sensible  or
responsive to the need to deal promptly with challenges. That is the  reason
we are confident of delivering on our mandate despite the magnitude  of  the
challenge.

We have put a lot of effort, thought and a lot of hard work into this  plan.
We are confident that it will work. Let me express the hope that next  year,
around this time, whoever will be standing here and talking on this  subject
will  say  something  very  positive.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chair of Committees, hon Minister, hon  special  delegates,
especially from the province of KwaZulu-Natal, hon colleagues, before  South
Africa's  first  democratic  elections  in  1994,  the   ANC   embarked   on
countrywide roadshows during which potential voters got, at first hand,  the
ANC's vision for a free South Africa.[Applause.]

I quote:


  Democracy will have little content and indeed will be short-lived  if  we
  cannot address our socioeconomic problems within an expanding and growing
  economy.

So said the hon  former  President  Nelson  Mandela  in  the  blueprint  for
transformation, known as the Reconstruction and Development  Programme,  the
RDP.

Today, nine years later, according to a  comprehensive  report  released  by
the SA Human Rights Commission, the HRC, the ANC  has  failed  to  keep  its
promises. [Interjections.]

The HRC said the Government has failed millions  of  poverty-stricken  South
Africans   through   gross   underspending,   maladministration   and   rank
incompetence, and not because of a lack of funds.

Therein lies the problem, and I am certain that the hon Minister will  share
the frustration of millions, like those in the  Eastern  Cape  for  example,
where it is expected that  only  R500Â million  will  be  spent  on  housing,
though it has been allocated a budget of R1,2 billion.

Not only the Eastern Cape, but  most  other  provinces,  including  KwaZulu-
Natal, are underspending on their budgets. And you heard  a  while  ago  the
hon member from Mpumalanga providing you with the shameful scenario of  high
percentages of  underspending.  Obviously,  capacity-building  is  the  main
bugbear. The hon Minister also alluded to land  transfer  to  municipalities
operating at a snail's pace. And then there was the question of  traditional
leaders, some of whom seem to adopt an unco-operative attitude.

The DA acknowledges and applauds  the  Ministry  for  putting  up  some  1,5
million housing units, but millions still remain homeless. Besides food  and
clothing, shelter remains the basic need for the poor in  our  midst,  since
the time of the Flintstones. The Government dare not let them down.

I am now going  to  dwell  on  that  slimy  creature  known  as  corruption.
Understandably, I will focus on my province,  KwaZulu-Natal,  where,  thanks
to the MEC for Housing, Rev Wilson Ngcobo  from  the  DA,  I  must  add  ...
[Interjections.] ... has been  busy  overturning  stones  and  exposing  the
rampant corruption that has been flourishing like slimy toads.

I have in my possession  just  a  few  articles  from  Housing  in  Southern
Africa, which is a reputed magazine. [Interjections.] In March  2003:  ``R30
million of taxpayers' cash wasted in KwaZulu-Natal property scam"; in  April
2003: ``All talk and no action! Will justice prevail?''

In his maiden speech in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature on 20  February  2003,
the MEC stated that the end of the  fraudsters  and  corrupt  officials  was
nigh. Rev Ngcobo said that whilst the majority of his staff are  hardworking
and honest people, they are also plagued by officials who  think  that  they
are above the law and not accountable to the taxpayers of the  province  and
the country.

In a period of just three and a half months  last  year,  the  KwaZulu-Natal
department of housing, in a  sudden  surge  of  acquisitions,  purchased  27
properties with the combined value of R73 million. The net  result  of  this
alleged scam amounts to  around  R30  million  in  taxpayers'  money,  which
should have gone towards housing the poor, but has instead  been  squandered
by allegedly corrupt officials.

I just read to you the headlines in the March  issue  of  Housing  in  South
Africa. The  news  report  reported  on  the  alleged  corrupt  transactions
involving Adv Emmanuel M Khoza, a departmental  head  of  the  KwaZulu-Natal
department of housing under the Ministry of ... [Time expired.]

Mr S L TSENOLI (Free State): Chairperson, I think the hon  member  who  just
spoke has a very short memory, like his party. They thrive on the  drama  of
little instances of corruption here, maladministration  there.  They  forget
that it is the ANC's integrity system that is unearthing these instances  of
corruption, which have been there before. [Applause.]

It is also appropriate to note that it is as a result of the stewardship  of
the ANC that the economy of this country has provided us with an  increasing
Housing budget. Just in the Free State, we had allocations of  R218  million
in 2000-01, R251Â million in 2001-02, R289 million in 2002-03  and  now  R325
million. This is what the ANC meant, and these are not donor funds. This  is
South African taxpayers' money. It is precisely because of this approach  to
our economy that we are able to generate enough  resources  to  increasingly
bring about a better life for all our people.

Of course it is because we are dealing with a mammoth task  created  over  a
period of 300 years that we will find problems of maladministration.  It  is
because  of  the  apartheid  system,  of  denying   people   education   and
opportunities for jobs that we are  dealing  with  people  ...  We  have  to
overhaul the engine, even if the body of the  vehicle  requires  some  touch
ups. What we are  seeing  are  birth  pangs  of  a  transforming  system  of
government and service delivery in our country.

I am proud to say that in our province we have just completed, in  the  past
three  weeks,  our  housing  sector  plans.  In  fact,  this  involves  five
municipalities, but four of them  are  the  main  municipalities:  Mangaung,
Metsimaholo,  Maluti-A-Phofung  as  well  as  Matjhabeng.  These  are  large
concentrations of people. This means that these housing sector plans,  which
become  part  of  municipalities'  IDPs,  will  be   able   to   guide   the
municipalities to deliver in a planned and co-ordinated manner.

If successfully implemented, which we intend to do, the  plan  will  help  a
municipality to stimulate local  economy,  create  an  environment  for  job
creation and address the needs of the aged, the disabled  and  HIV  victims.
It will help the municipalities to correct the special  disparities  of  the
apartheid era and ensure that integration and co-ordination  happen  between
housing and other service provisions, such as  infrastructural  development,
including roads,  transport,  education,  health,  tourism  and  safety  and
security.  This  is  integration.  This  is  according  to  our   integrated
development plan, which is a planning tool for all of Government.

It is important that we report on a series of steps that we  are  taking  in
the province, just like the other provinces are doing, to  turn  around  our
institutions that are  intended  to  deliver.  This  is  in  our  provincial
departments, but we  also  happen  to  be  responsible  for  turning  around
municipalities that are critical to delivery and there are 25  of  these  in
our province.

In relation to the steps that we are talking about,  project  management  is
obviously one of the key areas in which we are intervening  to  ensure  that
projects are finished on time, according  to  specifications  and  following
the allotted budget. We are filling posts that are  strategic  in  order  to
speed up this process.

Our agreement with the National Home Builders  Registration  Council  is  to
ensure that we have greater numbers of teams  for  quality  inspections  and
monitoring. We are collaborating, as I said earlier on, with other  national
departments: the Minister's department and DPLG, as  well  as  the  Auditor-
General  and  other  institutions  that  deal  with  maladministration   and
corruption.

We are capacitating municipalities to ensure that land  is  made  available.
There is bulk service and  households  are  provided,  and  that  all  these
processes are in place to help accelerate service delivery.

We are also working in collaboration with  the  national  department,  other
provinces and the Cuban government. We will be working with  some  of  their
engineers and professionals  who  are  skilled  in  participatory  processes
relating to our housing support centres. They will not only  help  speed  up
delivery, but also help with creative delivery of these services.

It is also crucial to state that  of  the  12Â 600  project-linked  subsidies
that we received in the previous year, 3Â 558 went to women-driven  projects.
In  addition,  820  housing  support  centre  subsidies  went  to  women-led
projects,  the  beneficiaries  of  which  the  majority  are  women  in  our
province.

It is also crucial to say that, in fact, part of  the  problem  of  delivery
relates to people who occupy land, as  well  as  informal  settlements,  for
which no plans existed for service delivery. And these integrated  plans  we
are talking about are intended to get rid of  informal  settlements  and  to
facilitate spatial integration of previously racially divided areas  and  so
on.

Our capacity-building  efforts  are  numerous.  They  include  the  People's
Housing Partnership Trust with the German technical co-operation,  GTZ.  But
more importantly, these capacity-building initiatives  also  involve  people
who provide services to people with disabilities, such as one of  our  pilot
projects. Over the next five years we will be giving subsidies to what  used
to be called the Mphatlalatsane School for the Disabled,  which  has  adults
there as well. One  of  our  well-performing  developers  in  the  province,
called Mac &  George,  are  people  with  disabilities,  and  they  are  top
performers.

We are also seriously considering  working  with  municipalities  to  ensure
that, given the  requirement  that  they  set  up  waiting  lists,  they  do
prioritise people with disabilities, the infirm, the aged  and,  of  course,
the indigent poor. As the process of delivery goes on, we  prioritise  those
people who are the most needy.

As the economy grows, it will increasingly make resources available. In  the
meantime, our people, in many instances, understand  the  reason  we  should
take this approach that we do not want to borrow excessively and,  in  fact,
create problems for our economy.

One of the most important issues  that  comes  across  in  the  delivery  of
housing and in dealing with problems of budgets, is our  manner  of  dealing
with issues. The SA Bureau of Standards is a custodian of quality.  We  will
be working with them  to  embrace  and  adopt  their  code  of  conduct  for
handling of complaints. This will enable our own departmental officials  and
municipalities to act, as we say, in a manner that prioritises dealing  with
people with dignity so that service delivery around housing is effective.

We have also come to a situation where we are now able to help  attract  the
private sector to the rental housing area. Because we are now in a  position
to  set  up  the  Rental  Housing  Tribunal,  we  are  inviting  people   to
participate in its creation, in terms of the Rental Housing Act.

Many of these initiatives depend for their success on  effective  leadership
at  local  government  level.  One  of  our  key  interventions  relates  to
collaboration with a number  of  institutions,  including  your  department,
Minister, in building the capacity  of  municipal  officials  and  municipal
councillors to fast-track housing delivery.

In  our  view  the  housing  sector  plans  constitute  plans   that,   when
implemented, will provide these municipal officials with a framework  within
which to work, in collaboration with us at provincial and  national  levels,
in order to build their capacity.

Capacity-building, especially around leadership, will  also  make  provision
for innovative and creative use of other  materials.  There  is  a  tendency
towards conservative usage of traditional material  and  some  phobia  about
newly created materials that can last longer and  can  even  provide  bigger
and more satisfying and aesthetically pleasing systems. So  we  are  working
with municipalities to generate these kinds of capacities. The  capacity  of
municipalities is a key component in helping to  fast-track  expenditure  of
resources allocated to us by national Government.

Another crucial point that I wanted to mention is that it is  not  only  the
housing fund allocations that have been increasing. Equitable  share,  which
enables municipalities to provide municipal  infrastructure  for  their  own
areas, has also been increased: Last year R94 million was  allocated  to  25
municipalities in our province and R117 million this coming year.
Similarly,  districts  that  are  responsible  for   managing   consolidated
municipal infrastructure programmes had about R136Â million in  the  previous
year. This year the allocation is R160 million,  and  it  will  continue  to
increase.

In my view, this is a demonstration of  the  robustness  of  our  policy  of
combining infrastructure, generally. In housing,  it  means  building  human
settlements in such a way  that  they  become  dignified  places  where  our
people live, and we will be proud when we  look  at  them,  over  time,  and
realise that these interventions have been successful ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr S L TSENOLI: Thank you, Madam Chair.

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson of Committees, hon  Minister  of  Housing,  MECs
present here today and hon members of  the  NCOP,  I  am  speaking  here  on
behalf of the province's MEC, Joe Maswanganyi, who could not make  it  owing
to other commitments. This is perhaps a sign of my loyalty to  my  province.
[Applause.]

I would like to seize this moment to  thank  the  Minister  of  Housing  for
tabling a budget that would go a long way towards  eradicating  poverty  and
underdevelopment afflicting our poor community of Limpopo.

I think we all know that almost 70% or 80% of  the  Limpopo  residents  fall
into the category of the poorest of the poor.  It  is  for  that  reason  we
argue that the successive progressive budgets of the Department  of  Housing
have ensured that  the  plight  of  the  rural  masses  in  the  Limpopo  is
addressed seriously.

However, we are quite aware - of course all provinces are -  that  criticism
being expressed in respect of the quality, space,  location  of  these;  the
list goes on.

But I just want to share this observation - unfortunately  Mr  Raju  is  not
around  -  that  given  the  abject  poverty  that  our  poor  Limpopo  find
themselves in, they have rather opted not to look  the  gift  horse  in  the
mouth. After all, a hungry stomach knows no appetite. Basically,  to  people
on the ground that shelter stands as one of the  primary  human  needs.  And
this particular area has been researched.

Who are we, poor as we are, to criticise and say that this house  should  be
having a door this side or that this house should be  having  that,  because
in Limpopo we are definitely poor. It might be true that not all the  people
are really in need of the  structures  that  are  put  up  in  Limpopo,  but
fortunately, the largest portion of  our  poor  people  in  those  areas  do
appreciate and commend a shelter above their heads.

The Limpopo province has focused on a number of  issues  in  terms  of  this
particular  housing  programme.  For  instance,  in  the  case   of   hostel
redevelopment, we have transformed the  old  hostels  that  were  previously
meant for migrant labourers into decent family units. In  the  past  hostels
destroyed the social fabric of our society by placing people far from  their
wives and children, and isolating hostel dwellers from  the  communities  in
which these hostels were located.

We have now completed about 1 000 units to the value  of  R10,7Â million.  In
other words, we have  converted  those  hostels  into  hospitable  units  of
dwelling in which whole  families  are  housed.  We  have  also  focused  on
another aspect that relates to discount benefit schemes.

You will remember that in the past Africans living  in  townships  were  not
allowed to own their own house; they  could  only  lease  property.  We  are
proud today to announce that in Limpopo, in the former Transvaal  Provincial
Administration towns,  645  title  deeds  are  ready  for  handover  to  the
beneficiaries, in this case the blacks.

It is not only people who live  in  the  former  TPA  towns  who  will  have
ownership of these houses transferred to them. Those  of  you  who  used  to
live in the townships were, in terms of regulation 293, not allowed  to  own
any property there. But let me put it on record  that  in  Limpopo  we  have
managed  to  have  111  properties  transferred  to  people  for   ownership
purposes.  These  efforts  will  ensure  a   sustainable   process   towards
deracialisation of towns.

Sorry! Perhaps, to put it aptly so that we  can  understand  here,  we  have
another problem in the Northern Province, where we have what we  call  rural
farms, such as Hoedspruit, Gravelot and Alldays farm - those  who  know  the
area. These are farm towns that are located outside big areas or big  cities
and which are predominantly white. We intend to move  towards  deracialising
little  towns  and,  of  course,  depoliticise  and   normalise   them   ...
[Interjections.] ... so that they could be brought  in  line  with  the  new
policy or national policy.

In the 2002-03 financial year we have built approximately 13Â 000 houses.  It
is remarkable to mention that  we  spent  almost  100%  of  the  budget  for
housing development, as  well  as  the  funds  received  from  the  disaster
command centre.

This particular financial year the budget at our disposal, of R345  million,
will help us  realise  the  constructing  of  4  950  rural  housing  units.
Regarding the People's Housing Process, we have earmarked R6 million  or  R7
million for the building of 300 units. We also intend, as well,  to  upgrade
almost 3 000 houses at a cost of R67 million.

We also commend the department for having increased the subsidy.  This  will
enable us to even improve further the quality of our houses. We must  expand
the horizons. Indeed, the new housing procurement regime  will  ensure  that
emerging local contractors have a  stake  in  the  mainstream  economy.  Our
budget  is  targeted  at  the  empowerment  of  young,  women  and  disabled
developers. Out of 60 new developers we have awarded  tenders  to  12  women
developers, 18 young developers and 4 disabled developers.

However, let me share with you the problems that we encounter in that  area.
We have a problem of access to land. Traditional leaders are  not  ready  or
willing to release land for development. We are also faced with the  problem
of service delivery. These are some of the issues that handicap progress.

In conclusion, let me reiterate that  the  Northern  Province's  people  are
poor; the Limpopo people are poor, and  the  majority  of  the  poor  people
definitely cannot afford to say: ``This  house  is  falling  apart  or  this
house is like that.'' After all, only a basic unit for shelter  is  provided
and the rest is left to the householder to patch  up.  During  the  day,  at
least these people could get some shelter.

I am saying this because I also  have  an  extended  family  whom  I  cannot
afford to provide with a house. And, of course, most of us here do  have  an
extended family that fall into the category  of  poor.  So  we  cannot  just
simply and totally  condemn  this  programme  of  housing.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, Minister of Housing,  MECs  and  colleagues,
the saying goes that a man's house, or a woman's for that matter, is his  or
her castle. I understand that to mean that however  humble  or  expensive  a
person's protection against the  elements  is,  that  particular  structure,
whether it is rented or owned, is the best that he or  she  can  afford  and
that it forms an important part of his or her daily life.

Your castle protects you not only against the  elements,  but  also  against
animal and, sadly in our times, human predators. When  the  doors  of  these
structures are closed at night, they also provide privacy for the  occupants
and their families.

Housing is one of the most basic needs after the needs of  sustenance.  That
being the case, a government's first duty to its people is to create and  to
provide the economic and social circumstances where everyone has  food  and,
secondly,  where  everyone  has  a  roof  over  his  or  her   head.   Those
circumstances do not necessarily mean that  government  should  provide  the
housing per se, but that the circumstances should be such that a person  can
provide for him or herself.

A country's economy should also be of such a  nature  that  in  cases  where
people are still so poor  that  they  cannot  provide  for  themselves,  the
government  will  be  able  and  willing  to  provide  the  necessary.  This
philosophy is perfectly in line with my party's economic policy  of  a  free
market with a social conscience.

It is also correct and appreciated that we in South Africa have  a  Minister
of Housing with a department whose stated aim, vision  and  mission  it  is,
and I quote: ``to determine, finance, promote, co-ordinate, communicate  and
monitor policy in respect of housing for  a  nation  housed  in  sustainable
human settlements''.

Which brings me to another and very important dimension of  housing  policy,
namely the intensified demand for urban housing and land available for  that
purpose. We  have  already  reached  the  point  where  we  are  exposed  to
intensified  social  and  economic  challenges  in  which  sectional   title
ownership is expected to satisfy that demand.

However,  notwithstanding  the  potential  advantages  of  sectional   title
housing, there is little doubt that this  form  of  co-ownership  of  common
property and attachment to a sectional title community presents  unique  and
difficult problems. Many of these problems  arise  from  owners  not  having
adapted themselves to the demands of the particular lifestyle and  ignorance
of the legal requirements which inevitably  lead  to  ineffective  and  poor
management, which in turn sets in motion a  chain  reaction  which  normally
leads to problems such as absence  of  communal  discipline,  mounting  body
corporate debts, physical deterioration of the buildings,  which  eventually
turn into slums, depreciation and a total loss of market value of the  units
and the eventual loss of the owners' investments.

Such a spiral of deterioration does not only have catastrophic  consequences
for the owners concerned, but serves to promote slum conditions  which  tend
to spread to adjoining areas. In the  macro  environment  it  leads  to  the
undermining of the ideal of social upliftment through  successful  universal
private home ownership.

The losers in such a scenario are, in the first  instance,  the  owners  and
then, in a line of succession, the mortgagee banks  which  become  extremely
reluctant to advance loans  in  areas  where  risky  schemes  are  situated;
municipalities, which must accept large  losses  on  rates  recoveries;  the
immediate urban environment, because  of  the  infectious  deterioration  of
neighbourhoods; and, finally, the general South African  population  through
the failure of sectional title schemes as an answer to the demand for  urban
housing.

Owing to historical  reasons  relating  to  the  technical  aspects  of  the
surveying and registration of land, the administration  of  that  particular
legislation falls within the ambit of the Department of Land Affairs. We  do
not believe that the  Sectional  Titles  Regulation  Board,  constituted  in
terms of the Sectional Titles Act, is equipped  to  deal  with  the  social,
administrative and management aspects of sectional title ownership.

The Board is, for the already mentioned  historical  reasons,  comprised  of
persons highly trained in the registration and survey aspects,  as  well  as
representatives of banks and of the legal profession. They tend to focus  on
statutory amendments relating to these technical  matters.  Their  expressed
attitude is that management problems should be solved  by  bodies  corporate
internally. Unfortunately, this is not a realistic point  of  view  and  has
resulted  in  failed  urban  sectional  title   schemes   reaching   endemic
proportions. The stark reality is that the most  important  stakeholders  in
sectional title housing, namely the owners, have no  representation  on  the
regulation board.

It has been suggested that the Department of Trade and Industry would be  an
appropriate  authority  to  assume  a  measure  of  responsibility  for  the
administrative and social  aspects  of  the  Act.  These  aspects  are  then
referred to as ``consumer matters''. Whilst  the  possible  contribution  of
DTI and its expertise in consumer affairs should not be underestimated,  the
success or  failure  of  sectional  titles  as  an  urban  housing  solution
dictates that these problems be seen in  a  more  serious  light  than  mere
consumer matters.

For this reason we suggest that the Department  of  Housing  should  take  a
direct interest in what is happening in urban sectional  title  schemes  and
should  assume  some  measure  of  responsibility  in  the  effort  to  find
solutions. The New NP supports the Housing budget. I thank you. [Applause.]

this House, let me start by expressing support for the budget  allocated  to
us. We appreciate the good work done  by  former  Minister  Sankie  Mthembi-
Mahanyele, but  today  we  also  wish  to  congratulate  our  Minister,  Mrs
Brigitte Mabandla, and we would like to say well done!

We know all your good work under Art, Science and technology. We  know  that
your efforts will enhance the process of building houses. We will always  be
proud of you.]

We understand your announcement to mean that the masses  of  the  people  of
our country are being assigned another cadre with  a  track  record  in  the
struggle for liberation under your  capable  leadership  in  the  department
that I have just mentioned.

The budget speech of 19 May 2003 has given hope to many of our citizens  who
are still patiently waiting to benefit from many of the  housing  programmes
Government has initiated. All ears were ready to  welcome  the  announcement
of the adjustments on housing  subsidies  to  match  the  current  inflation
levels. Let  me  assure  you  that  our  people  have  warmly  welcomed  the
announcement.

We understand you to be saying that for those who earn from  R0-R1Â 500,  the
subsidy will rise by R2 800. But let me skip some  of  the  figures  and  go
right into  the  implications  of  these  increases.  These  show  that  the
Government remains absolutely consistent  in  its  commitment  to  focus  on
assisting the poorest of the poor to access affordable houses.

We want to  pledge  our  support  to  the  Minister  as  she  considers  the
possibility of lifting the income level limit from R1  500  to  the  highest
subsidy amount of R1 794-50, which  is  currently  defined  as  the  minimum
living wage. We welcome that. Our humble request to you,  Comrade  Minister,
is to essentially remind those who will be  assisting  you  on  this  matter
that this process ought to be speeded up as much as possible.

We have noted with increased enthusiasm the reference made to the  principle
of integrating development planning  in  your  speech.  We  share  the  same
understanding that housing cannot and should not be seen in  isolation  from
other developmental  aspects  of  society.  Development  projects  all  over
Gauteng have been guided by this principle, and your mentioning  it  in  the
speech will be taken as a challenge for us to  review  further  and  improve
our ability to enhance an integrated approach.

This integrated approach was evident in the Alexandra  Renewal  Project  and
it will once more  be  evident  as  Kliptown  tackles  the  same  challenge.
Bekkersdal will also follow suit. The regeneration of townships  and  cities
has the potential to turn these areas into centres of economic  success  and
uplift the human spirit. Bara  Link  and  other  initiatives  are  meant  to
integrate South Africans across the colour line,  thus  reversing  what  was
created during apartheid.

The Premier of Gauteng, Comrade Mbhazima Shilowa, in his speech  during  the
opening of the legislature,  announced  that  currently  89  000  stands  in
Gauteng would be provided with water and sanitation.  He  further  announced
that 3 200 000 people will have access to water and sanitation  by  the  end
of the next financial year.

Your speech to Parliament will help us explain to  our  constituencies  what
has been accomplished in the past seven years, particularly with  regard  to
the struggle we have  waged  throughout  these  years  against  poverty  and
joblessness. Our MEC is currently making the rounds among municipalities  to
find out about their problems and help address them.

One area that has been noted is that of  capacity-building.  Officials  from
both municipalities and the province have just graduated following a  course
at Wits. Standing committee members also attended and graduated, and  I  was
fortunate to be one of them.

Capacitating small, emerging contractors is also  taking  place  continually
and it takes into cognisance that it is central that women and  people  with
disabilities should benefit from that programme.

Finally, we have developed a keen interest  in  the  decisions  of  the  UN-
HABITAT. We are also keen to show the international  organisation  mentioned
that we have truly understood our mandate, particularly from the WSSD  which
we hosted last year. We will do all in our power to  satisfy  the  needs  of
our communities because that is the mandate we understand better.

We wish you, Comrade Minister, a happy term of office and  above  all,  good
health so that you continue to guide us with your wisdom. [Applause.]

Mnu M A MZIZI (KwaZulu-Natali):  Sihlalo,  ngivumele  ngithathe  leli  thuba
lokuhalalisela uNgqongqoshe uBrigitte Mabandla  ekuthatheni  lesi  sikhundla
sokuba  nguNgqongqoshe   weziNdlu.   Kanjalo   mangivalelise   noNgqongqoshe
uMthembi-Mahanyele engisebenze naye kahle kakhulu  esikhathini  esiphambili.
Mhlawumbe uma singivumela isikhathi ngisazobuya kule ndaba ukuze  ngedlulise
kahle ukuthi ngisebenze kanjani  naye.  (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragraph
follows.)

[Chairperson, allow me to take this  opportunity  to  congratulate  Minister
Brigitte Mabandla on her appointment as Minister of  Housing.  At  the  same
time, let me say goodbye to Minister Mthembi-Mahanyele, with whom  I  worked
very well in the past. Perhaps, if there is  enough  time,  I  will  revisit
this matter and speak properly about how I worked with her.]

Housing in our country is a  very  complicated  process  that  needs  to  be
examined thoroughly and comprehensively, as millions  of  our  people  still
have the problem of being homeless. The World  Bank  Development  Report  of
2003 pointed out that housing in the developing and underdeveloped world  is
a crucial challenge facing both society and lawmakers. Thus it is  incumbent
upon us to face the challenges of development in a sector that  is  directly
associated with a well-planned and implemented delivery process.

One has to admit that there have been some advances made  in  this  respect,
but the fact remains that there are still millions  of  our  people  without
shelter.  There  is  thus  a  serious  backlog  in  delivery   despite   the
introduction of the People's Housing  Process  and  several  other  measures
specifically to alleviate existing problems.

Some  of  the  programmes  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  for  example,  face   serious
impediments. Thus the number of allocated projects in KwaZulu-Natal in 2002-
03 has decreased to 12 compared to 30 in 2001-02.  The  allocated  subsidies
also decreased from 22 166 in 2001-02 to 10 945 in  2002-03.  These  figures
point to a continuous backlog.

This reality is exacerbated by the shortage of land in  many  areas  of  our
country, as studies at the University  of  Natal  in  2002  have  indicated.
There is also a shortage of farms in the rural and semirural areas. Thus  it
is imperative that the  associated  processes  of  land  redistribution  and
relocation need to become an urgent priority for the department.

However, all the ambitious and well-meaning programmes, such as the  hostels
redevelopment programmes, the human settlement redevelopment programmes  and
the removal of urban squatters cannot be  achieved  by  the  political  will
alone. Urgent financial resources is an urgent priority  that  needs  to  be
met.

It is well-known to all of us  that  there  are  fiscal  constraints  and  a
myriad of other priorities. However, I urge the ministry and all  of  us  to
do our utmost for more funding to be allocated for housing. Our people  need
good quality houses for themselves and their  families,  especially  in  the
rural and semirural areas where development is slower.

Mismanagement, corruption, incompetence and lack of  accountability  at  all
levels need  to  be  fought  tooth  and  nail  in  the  housing  department.
Innovation, more funds, determination and acceleration of delivery  of  good
houses need to be our top priorities. We cannot fail our people.

Yingakho-ke ngithi, mina uma ngibhekisa kuNgqongqoshe, noma  yiliphi  iqembu
elingasukuma la lithi iqembu lami lenza  lokhu,  iqembu  lami  lenza  lokhu,
iqembu lami lizokwenza lokhu. Isekhona inkinga. Akuzukusiza-ke  ukuma  lapha
sithi, i-ANC ayenzanga  lokhu,  asukume  omunye  athi,  i-ANC  yenze  lokhu,
nomunye asukume asho okunye.  Ikhona  inkinga.  Ukuthi  ishiywe  ubani  leyo
nkinga akusho lutho. Abantu ngaphandle basibuka emehlweni.  Ake  ngisho  nje
ukuthi ngike ngezwa umfowethu uTsenoli ekhuluma ngezempilo. (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[That's why I say to the Minister that if any party can  come  forward  here
and claim to be doing this and that, and also promise  to  do  something  in
future, it means we still have a problem. It's  not  going  to  help  us  to
stand up here and say that the ANC did not do this while one  member  stands
up and says the ANC did that, and another one says something else. There  is
a problem. It does not matter who left that problem  there.  People  outside
are looking directly at us. I heard my brother Tsenoli  speak  about  health
issues.]

Ms V TAMBO (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  thank  you  for  giving  me  this
opportunity to take part in this very important budget debate.

Mangihalalisele umama wethu  osiphethe  kulo  mNyango.  Ngithi  wenza  kahle
kakhulu, kepha-ke uthi  uma  kunezinkinga  kwezinye  izifundazwe  kubonakala
sengathi akucacile kahle, kanti yingxaki ekhona kuleso sifundazwe.

Kubuhlungu  nje  ukuthi  ilungu  elihloniphekile   uMnu   Raju   usehambile.
[Ubuwelewele.]

AMALUNGU AHLONIPHEKILE: Ukhona. Nangu.

Nk V TAMBO: Sihlalo, bengingambonanga ukuthi ukhona. Ngifuna  ukuthi  yi-ANC
kuqala   phambili   ekwaziyo   ukubhekana   nokukhwabanisa   nokukhohlakala.
Asiyifundiswa leyo nto yinto  esiyaziyo.  Kodwa  lokhu  kuhambisana  nokuthi
kufuneka ukuba umsebenzi uqhubeke ngendlela eyiyo.

Into   eyenzekile   KwaZulu-Natali   yokushintshwashintshwa    koNgqongqoshe
bezifundazwe isilimaze kakhulu ngoba umsebenzi namanje usamile,  akubonakali
okwenzekayo. Mangiqale-ke nangomcimbi. (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[Let me congratulate our mother who is leading  us  in  this  department.  I
would like to say that she is doing very well. However, she says  that  it's
not clear when there are  problems  in  other  provinces  while  in  fact  a
problem really exists in a particular province.

It's a pity that the hon Raju has gone. [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: He is here.

Ms V TAMBO: Chairperson, I was not aware that he is present. I want  to  say
that it's the ANC which is able to lead the fight against  the  embezzlement
of funds and corruption. That is  something  that  we  are  not  taught,  we
simply know it. But this is linked with the fact  that  work  must  be  done
properly.

The reshuffling of MECs in KwaZulu-Natal did us a  big  disservice,  because
work has now come to a standstill, one cannot see what is going on.  Let  me
now focus on the matter at hand.]

The demise of apartheid laws has unleashed a surge,  in  large  numbers,  of
people from rural to urban areas and from smaller  towns  to  large  cities.
That is a reality. This is an impediment  to  the  mission  of  implementing
effectively and efficiently the national and provincial  housing  programmes
in partnership with the relevant role-players, and  of  providing  adequate,
affordable,  quality  and  sustainable  shelter  for  the  citizens  of  our
country.

We  have  some  challenges  facing  the  provincial  departments  concerning
service delivery, which include, inter alia, the fact  that  the  previously
disadvantaged institutions tend to be slow and  lack  monitoring  strategies
for the quick delivery of housing, and for sustained delivery.

Our Government has done remarkably well by allocating such a big budget  for
housing. However, it may not be worth cheering owing to a number of  issues,
such as the rising demand for low-cost houses,  which  makes  the  challenge
rather daunting.

The urban need for  housing  needs  to  be  addressed.  There  needs  to  be
integration  and   co-ordination   in   housing   delivery,   provision   of
infrastructure, and promises should be kept.

The Constitution, Act No 108 of 1996, contains guidelines for the  provision
of and the right of access to adequate housing. This is  entrenched  in  the
Bill of Rights, which, amongst others,  facilitates  appropriate  devolution
of functions and powers to provincial and  local  government.  That  is  the
importance of decentralising the provision of housing.

I would like the department to form strategic plans  towards  the  provision
of capacity, and towards development and promotion of a  relevant  programme
for local authorities to speed up the process of delivery of housing and  to
continue upgrading informal settlements and clearing  slum  areas.  I  would
also like the department to ensure that  slum  areas  are  located  on  land
suitable for human settlement  and  to  prevent  the  proliferation  of  new
informal settlements.
I must also mention here the  challenge  of  provision  of  land  for  human
settlement ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): [Inaudible.]

Ms V TAMBO (KwaZulu-Natal): ... I am sorry, Mr  ChairpersonÃ¿  ...  and  this
can easily be done by ensuring integration  between  our  housing  and  land
reform programmes. We also need to note that the Government must  ...  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, hon MECs, members of the NCOP,  it's  so  late
in  the  afternoon;  I  think  I  am  not  going   to   waste   your   time.
[Interjections.]

 The creation of a nonracial, nonsexist and  democratic  society  was  about
the liberation of Africans in particular and black people  in  general  from
political and economic bondage, and the improvement of the quality  of  life
of all South Africans, the majority of whom are African females.

Let me express a  sense  of  appreciation  to  Government  for  prioritising
poverty alleviation by reorientating the Budget, the fiscal policy  and  the
public sector towards redistribution and meeting  the  basic  needs  of  the
disadvantaged and the poor.  The  Northern  Cape  Province  will  spend  R83
million to build about 4 100 houses.

Again, this province has won three national housing awards, which  indicates
that the ANC-led Government  is  indeed  achieving  the  goal  of  providing
decent houses to our people. Thousands of our people  who  never  dreamt  of
having shelter over their heads now do. It has been and will always  be  our
ANC-led Government that works tirelessly to improve  the  living  conditions
of our people.

In his state of the nation address earlier this  year,  the  President  once
again reconfirmed the Government's determination to push back the  frontiers
of poverty and underdevelopment. This is a clarion call to all  patriots  in
our country to forge partnerships in the battle against  dehumanisation  and
the crushing effects of abject  poverty.  This  was  the  result  of  social
engineering  deliberately  pursued  by  the  past  colonial  and   apartheid
policies.

But we  also  stand  here  today  on  the  verge  of  celebrating  our  10th
democratic social order, an era characterised by  challenges  more  daunting
than those we encountered with the  advent  of  our  democratic  order.  The
Reconstruction and Development Programme continues to  organise,  shape  and
influence our strategies and approaches towards the achievement of a  better
life for all.

Our considered conclusion is that our policies and objectives  are  correct,
and that the attainment of these objectives has  been  outstanding  in  most
individual areas, with weaknesses in a few critical  areas.  The  answer  to
the call of the President  finds  expression  in  a  number  of  programmes.
Amongst other  things,  our  province  is  geared  towards  making  numerous
determined interventions that  will  contribute  to  the  attainment  of  an
equitable society.

Fighting  poverty  and  underdevelopment  is  the  business  of   everybody.
Sustainable economic development is  about  enlarging  choices  and  raising
their standard of living. However, we as the ANC acknowledge that no  sphere
of government can effectively meet its challenges unless all  the  component
parts of Government  operate  or  function  in  a  coherent  and  integrated
manner.

I am glad to announce to this House that the Northern  Cape  has  created  a
structure known as the Northern Cape Intergovernmental Relations Council  to
promote co-ordination, integration and service delivery. This  is  assisting
the province a lot because we avoid the duplication  of  programmes  by  the
various departments.

The challenges that we face, for example  effective  and  efficient  service
delivery to our communities, are not insurmountable and collectively,  using
all the resources that we have in all spheres of  government,  we  can  meet
them.

Our constitutional mandate does not  allow  us  to  tolerate  any  negligent
management whatsoever that results in  run-down  municipal  infrastructures.
And to this effect, we will ensure that the funds we vote to  municipalities
from our department  are  utilised  responsibly  and  effectively  for  that
particular purpose.

Considerable progress has been made in the province with regard to  delivery
of housing. In the past financial year about 2  082  new  houses  have  been
built under the People's Housing Process. This  has  been  achieved  through
the co-ordinated efforts of all the organisations,  developments  and  small
contractors, financial institutions, local authorities,  women's  groups  in
housing and suppliers that have contributed to the provision of  housing  in
our province.

An achievement that needs to be acknowledged is that  for  the  first  time,
our province is in a position to regulate specific  target  groups  such  as
disabled women and children,  who  have  been  incorporated  into  the  core
business of housing.
We have managed to engage successfully private sector participation  in  the
housing development process  and  to  ensure  that  the  housing  market  is
extended to the  middle-income  target  groups.  The  base  for  the  rental
housing market  has  been  increased  through  the  awarding  of  two  pilot
institutional projects. One has  been  awarded  in  Kathu,  securing  public
sector investment form Imperial Bank, Sishen Iron Ore  Mine  and  Lakutshona
Housing Company. For the first phase, 500 subsidies have been  allocated.  A
second project was awarded in Kimberley and is  a  joint  venture  involving
the department, Standard Bank, the Sol Plaatjie Housing Company and Sida.

It is intended that another 3 683 houses will be  delivered  this  financial
year, using the funds that were allocated to our province. I am  pleased  to
say that the introduction of tender procedures,  for  example,  Preferential
Procurement  Guidelines,  in  housing  development  processes  has  received
attention this year.

The  new  housing  allocation  has  been  awarded  to  municipalities,   and
workshops have been held with  them  to  outline  the  new  processes.  This
process is going to fast-track the unfinished projects  that  we  have  been
complaining about and get rid of the fly-by-night  contractors  who  rip  us
off for huge amounts in our provinces.

Furthermore, the national Departments of Land Affairs  and  Housing  took  a
joint position on the utilisation  of  the  housing  subsidy  programmes  by
beneficiaries of land restitution claims and are still engaged in trying  to
perfect the integration of these programmes. This programme  will  certainly
place beneficiaries in a better financial position to build bigger houses.

This budget must realise the functioning  of  the  Rental  Housing  Tribunal
Committee that  has  been  appointed  this  year  to  advise  the  executive
authority on strategic housing  matters.  The  Housing  allocation  in  this
dispensation needs to take another angle.

The policies of the ANC state  categorically  that  the  Housing  allocation
should bring occupants nearer to their workplace, but the  opposite  is  the
case. If one looks at all the RDP houses, one finds that they are  far  away
from the Central Business District.  What  are  the  effects  of  this?  The
reason I am raising this  is  that  we  need  to  relook  our  municipal  ID
programmes and make sure that we have an  integrated  development  programme
at local level.

For example, parents are compelled to leave some of their  houses  as  early
as 4:30 in the  dark  hours  of  the  morning.  They  leave  their  children
unattended and these children become care-givers to  their  young  siblings.
The parents are not there to give guidance to their children. As  a  result,
you will find many drop-outs because these parents are not aware that  their
kids are no longer attending school.

Economically it also becomes burdensome because in some cases  parents  must
take more than two buses to get to their  workplaces  and  spend  perhaps  a
third or half of their wages on transport. We need  an  integrated  approach
when we deliver services to our people.

The ANC's mandate of pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty  is  a  reality
that needs to be maintained, and with that approach our country will  really
alleviate  poverty  for  many  South  Africans.  Women's  participation   is
crucial. Over the next three years we in the province have allocated a  non-
negotiable portion of the budget, that is 10%, for women's empowerment.

It is a fact that when you educate a woman, you educate a nation.  We  would
have not been here now had it not been for women's  contribution.  Hence  in
whatever we are doing, be it  provincially  or  nationally,  women  need  to
benefit and be our priority.

This commitment of improving the lives of our people needs to  be  practised
across the spectrum. Housing subsidies for the disabled is  also  increasing
over the next three years. This is a sign that we  are  alleviating  poverty
because with these projects we are creating jobs at  the  same  time.  Thank
you very much, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, I regret that your  speaking
time had expired. Hon members told me that  you  added  the  last  paragraph
when you saw me in the Chair. [Laughter.]

Ms N E HANGANA (Western Cape): Hon Chairperson,  Minister  of  Housing,  hon
Brigitte Mabandla, members of the House as well as all other  MECs  who  are
present today, it is an honour to be in your presence  again.  A  very  good
afternoon to all of you. I want to say, before I  make  my  contribution  to
this debate, that I am very impressed with the new look of the  Chamber.  It
is absolutely stunning; it is beautiful.

The Western Cape has reached a stage  where  there  is  complete  stability,
after the formation of the coalition between the NNP  and  the  ANC.  We  no
longer have spooks in our offices who spy on people. We are also  busy  with
a people's budget, where moneys given to this province go to where they  are
needed, to the poor of this country. We are very proud to say that  we  walk
with our heads held high now that our people are being  given  attention  in
this province, for the first time.

Since its  inception  in  1994,  the  new  national  housing  programme  has
delivered some shelter and basic services to  some  5  million  people.  The
provincial department of  the  Western  Cape  has  delivered  over  170  000
houses, thereby providing shelter to approximately 350  000  poor  families.
Although   our   achievements   have   been   recognised   nationally    and
internationally, there is still room for improvement.

To ensure a shift from quantity to quality in respect of  housing  delivery,
my department has already embarked on  the  implementation  of  the  Housing
Consumers  Protection  Measures  Act,  which  is  aimed  at  enforcing   the
registration of all home builders involved in subsidised  housing  with  the
National Home Builders Registration  Council.  My  department  has  in  this
regard signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Home  Builders
Registration Council. Mechanisms to streamline  the  process  are  currently
being developed.

I now come to the delays in the handing over of subsidy houses. My  province
is also affected by delays in the handing over of  subsidy  houses.  One  of
the projects that are mainly affected by  this  problem  is  the  Crossroads
Housing Development  Project,  which  is  part  of  the  presidential  urban
renewal project, popularly known as the Integrated Serviced Land Project.

What  is  happening  in  Crossroads  is  basically  political  interference,
generally in development  and  in  housing  in  particular,  which  has  had
adverse  consequences  for  delivery  to  poor  people.  It   is   sad   ...
[Interjections.] ... This resulted from your interference. I am still  going
to get you at the provincial legislature. [Laughter.] It is sad that in  the
end it is the poor people who suffer the most.

In addition, this problem has financial implications  for  Government.  This
relates to unbudgeted security costs,  the  costs  of  repairing  vandalised
houses and the costs incurred by extending the project's contract.

There are a number of projects that were initiated some years ago  that  are
still incomplete, largely as a result  of  escalating  building  costs.  The
approved top structures could no longer  be  provided  from  the  originally
approved subsidy amount. A mechanism has now been put in place whereby  such
blocked projects can be resuscitated. My department will be  contacting  all
municipalities where projects have ground to a  halt  and  will  be  putting
measures in place to ensure that these projects are completed.

With reference to the financial plan for  2003-04,  my  department  has  the
following objectives, contained  within  our  strategic  plan:  to  allocate
funds to 30 municipalities; to process and  approve  10  000  project-linked
subsidies, 1 500 individual credit-linked subsidies, 2 000 People's  Housing
Process subsidies,  3  000  consolidation  subsidies,  1  000  institutional
subsidies, 400 relocation subsidies, 100 rural subsidies and 1 000  savings-
linked subsidies; to  process  payment  in  respect  of  three  hostels  and
emergency assistance.

Let me now address the major challenges  facing  my  department.  The  major
challenges facing my department that account for the  lack  of  delivery  in
general and underexpenditure in particular  include  ...  But,  fortunately,
this financial year I've spent about 92% of my budget. So it's not that  bad
in the Western Cape.

While the requirement that  beneficiaries  should  contribute  R2Â 479  as  a
prerequisite for accessing housing subsidies,  we  contribute  significantly
towards ensuring the development of quality  houses  as  well  as  promoting
self-reliance amongst the beneficiaries. Lack of mechanisms and systems  for
the collection of  the  contribution  has  contributed  to  the  problem  of
underexpenditure.  The  heads  of  housing  are  presently  addressing  this
matter. The implementation of the NHBRC also  contributes  to  underspending
by provinces.

The  challenge  facing  us  is  building  the  capacity  of  provincial  and
municipal  officials  and  of  councillors  in  housing,  and  focusing   on
practical and sustainable capacity-building initiatives  for  beneficiaries.
In this regard, my department is at  present  providing  project  management
skills and monitoring its support to municipalities, especially the  smaller
municipalities.

In the past four months I've also visited a number of municipalities  within
the province to establish their  delivery  constraints  and  challenges.  My
department  is  now  developing  a   comprehensive   strategy   to   support
municipalities struggling with capacity problems.

It is a challenge to obtain affordable, suitable land for housing  close  to
transport nodes and economic opportunities. The high cost of  suitable  land
for housing has always been and still continues to be a challenge.  This  is
being addressed, and I hope I'll  be  able  to  come  back  with  good  news
concerning this matter in the near future.
A number of audits have been conducted in this regard. All we need to do  is
consolidate  these  audits  to  integrate  housing  development  with  other
service providers such as schools,  clinics,  crÃ©ches  and  other  forms  of
infrastructure which cannot be provided from housing funds.

I now come to housing contribution to black  economic  empowerment.  Housing
development has always had a direct impact on economic empowerment  in  that
housing delivery creates jobs for the formal as  well  as  informal  housing
sectors. Most, if not all, housing projects are  subcontracted  to  emerging
contractors. Relying on the big  contractors  for  the  development  of  the
emerging ones is not enough. It takes  emerging  contractors  long,  if  not
forever, to be able to stand on their  own  feet.  This  is  the  reason  my
department will be focusing on  sustainable  capacity-building  of  emerging
contractors and women in construction within  the  next  financial  year  as
part of its strategic objectives.

Having carefully studied  housing,  I  discovered  a  number  of  things.  I
discovered that housing delivery is slow and as such struggles  to  keep  up
with the demand. I've  also  realised  that  the  housing  delivery  process
itself is riddled with quite a number of problems.  But,  most  importantly,
I've realised that I cannot do it on my own. Frankly, one always needs  that
extra help. [Interjections.] From the DA.

In response to my  discovery,  I  have  appointed  consultants  to  help  me
formulate my 2014 vision  document  called  ``Accelerated  Housing  Delivery
Strategy''. The emphasis of this strategy is on partnerships with all  role-
players in housing. At the indaba that my  department  hosted  on  23  April
2003, the Housing Partnership Council was formed and will help  me  identify
and tackle, as a collective, I might add, blockages in housing delivery.  It
is only when we work as a collective that we  stand  a  chance  against  the
forever increasing housing  backlog  in  the  Western  Cape,  which  at  the
present moment stands at 320 000 houses.
Lastly, speaking of wanting assistance from the DA, their  posters  are  all
over the Western Cape, that say: ``Deploy 150 000 police in the  streets  of
Cape Town.'' In fact, it should read: ``Yes, deploy 150 000  police  in  the
streets of Cape Town, but  they  will  be  paid  by  the  DA.''  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Nk  B  THOMPSON:  Ngiyabonga  Sihlalo.   Amalungu   ahloniphekile,   uQabane
uBrigitte, namanxusa. Ngizothatha nje ithuba elincane  ngithi  kuRaju  ngoba
ngiyazi kungenzeka ukuthi akazi ukuthi indaba uma isisezithebeni  zenkantolo
ayibe isaxoxwa kule ndlu. Ngiyazi ukuthi awukwazi  lokho.  Ngikufundisile-ke
namhlanje okuncane. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Ms B THOMSON: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon  members,  Comrade  Brigitte  and
special delegates, I will take this small opportunity to  inform  hon  Raju,
because I know that he might not know that once the issue has been  referred
to court, it is no longer discussed in this House. I know that he  does  not
know that, so I have now given him a small lesson.]

Let me begin by paying tribute to former Minister Comrade  Sankie  and  also
to Comrade Dumisani Makhaya, who is now the MEC for Agriculture in  KwaZulu-
Natal.

Kukhona iculo lesintu elithi: ``Zingaba buhlungu zonke  izinto  kodwa  hhayi
njengokuswela indawo yokulala.''  [There  is  an  African  song  that  goes:
``Things can be bad, but not so bad that one has no place to sleep.'']

Every sphere of government has an important role to play  in  ensuring  that
those in need are housed. The core function of the Department of Housing  is
to provide a framework within which to guide  local  municipalities  in  the
development of housing.

The duty of Parliament  is  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  Government
policy. To date our Government has contributed  R19Â billion  to  just  under
1,5 million  low-cost  housing  opportunities.  In  playing  this  role  the
Government is  guided  by  the  understanding  that  housing  delivery  must
contribute to the improvement the of the social and economic  conditions  of
our people living in slums, rural areas and informal settlements.

Simethulela isigqoko uhulumeni kaKhongolose okwazi ukuqonda ukuthi  empeleni
ukhona umehluko  phakathi  kwezilwane  nabantu.  Siyavumelana  futhi  nalabo
abathi  zincane  lezi  zindlu.  Siyavumelana  futhi  nalabo  abathi  izindlu
ezakhiwa uhulumeni wethu zincane. Kodwa esikushoyo sithi yebo zincane  kodwa
kulabo  abazidingayo  azizincane.  Futhi  sithi  abanikazi   balezi   zindlu
abakhokhi ntela kumuntu.  Futhi  sithi  bona  bayazithokozela  ngoba  akekho
uhulumeni owake wabanika ezinkulu ngaphambilini.   (Translation  of  isiZulu
paragraph follows.)

[We congratulate the ANC-led Government for being able  to  understand  that
there is a difference between a human being and an  animal.  We  agree  with
those people who say that the houses that our Government  is  providing  are
small. We say yes, they are small, but they are not small to those who  need
them. We are also saying that the owners of these houses  pay  no  taxes  on
these houses, and that they enjoy these houses  because  no  government  has
given them any houses before.]

Roll-overs in the Department of Housing are a matter  of  concern,  but  one
does appreciate the decrease across provinces, between 1995-96 and  2000-01,
from R2,2 billion to  R519  million.  The  amount  of  roll-overs  was  R458
million in 2001-02 and it is expected to increase to  R885  million  of  the
total Housing allocation in 2002-03. Out  of  the  total  of  the  roll-over
amount, R240 million is unspent funds from the  Job  Summit  Rental  Housing
Programme involving Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga.

As Government we believe in quality rather than quantity. Hence  all  houses
built under the low-cost schemes  are  registered  with  the  National  Home
Builders Registration Council, whose duty is that of quality  control.  This
council provides beneficiaries with warranty protection against  defects  in
new homes  and  against  any  failure  of  builders  to  comply  with  their
obligations in terms of the Housing Consumers Protection  Measures  Act.  To
this end, the council has the big  responsibility  to  ensure  that  service
providers do not provide low-quality houses to our people.

We also take note of the housing institutions in place, as we do  understand
that sustainable low-cost housing needs a joint  effort  between  Government
and  the  private  sector.  These  housing  institutions  are  some  of  the
strategies used  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  low-cost
housing finance.

These include the Rural  Housing  Loan  Fund,  the  SA  Housing  Trust,  the
Service Housing Solution, Thubelitsha homes, the  National  Housing  Finance
Corporation and the National Urban Reconstruction and  Housing  Agency.  All
these agencies are a means of making sure that our  people  have  access  to
sustainable, low-cost housing.

In conclusion, we wish our Minister Comrade  Brigitte  success  in  her  new
task. We also say to the Director-General, Ms Mpumi Nxumalo  and  the  hard-
working staff of the department:  ``The  sky  is  the  limit.''  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOUSING: Chairperson, let me begin by saying thank you  very
much for the warm welcome as this is my first appearance before  this  House
as Minister of Housing. And also, thank you for supporting the budget.

Let me share with you my thoughts since I got into this post.  It's  one  of
great hope and, in this context, let me say to  the  colleagues,  the  MECs,
that I've had two MinMecs already, and resulting from the  deliberations  at
MinMecs and from the issues we are handling - all the issues that  you  have
raised here - there are in fact work in progress. In  midterm,  through  the
portfolio committee  and  other  relevant  structures,  we  will  report  on
progress in the various areas.

I would also like to thank all the MECs for inviting  me  to  the  provinces
for site visits. I have managed to visit five provinces, and these  are  the
Eastern Cape, Limpopo, Gauteng, Western Cape  and  Mpumalanga.  And  I  must
say, once more, that what I saw there was also very encouraging. I do  think
though that we are indeed challenged in the  area  of  housing  finance.  My
sense is that we would need to work in  a  dedicated  manner,  together,  to
address those particular challenges.

I would then like to turn to  specific  questions  that  were  raised  here.
Firstly, concerning the one that was raised by Mr Raju  on  corruption,  let
me just say that this is the context in  which  the  department  in  January
2002 appointed a task  team  to  investigate  alleged  corruption  cases  in
housing.  The  task  team  submitted  a  report  in  November,   which   was
subsequently  handed  over  to  the  Office  of  the  Director   of   Public
Prosecutions for  further  processing  and  conclusion  of  the  cases.  The
investigations have so far resulted in arrests and, you know,  a  number  of
those arrests have occurred in various provinces throughout the country.

But I also just want to say that the  provincial  MECs  and  the  provincial
departments  are  also  committed  to  the  eradication  of  any   form   of
incompetency,  because  most  of  these  cases  have  largely  to  do   with
incompetency rather than with corruption; but indeed also with corruption.

And I must confirm that it was indeed my department - and, again, credit  to
the previous Minister of Housing - together with the  respective  provincial
departments, the National Prosecuting  Authority  and  other  state  organs,
that   established   a   framework    for    ensuring    that    corruption,
maladministration and theft are eradicated.  And  I  am  sure  that  in  due
course we will pronounce more on this, because this is also  an  area  which
is work in progress.

I now come to the question raised by the hon member  Mr  WindvoÃ«l,  relating
to the Fiscal Review Report. I would like to say in that  regard  that  this
was based on media projections, but  also  that  we  had  the  privilege  of
looking at this matter further in our last MinMec of 16 April.

I can say here that in fact the roll-overs amount to 25%. We are  concerned,
of course, and we would like to improve this figure. But I must say,  again,
that if one looks at the whole issue  of  roll-overs  over  the  past  three
years, there is an improvement annually. And that says that the systems  are
beginning to yield positive results.

With regard to the issue raised  on  sectional  titles,  the  Department  of
Provincial and Local Government is currently drafting a Bill. This issue  is
very important in that context  and  we  think  that  it  will  address  the
particular problem that he raised.

Let me also take this opportunity to thank my department.  Indeed,  comrade,
you are right: These are very committed and hard-working officials. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
   AFFAIRS - NOTICE IN TERMS OF INTERIM RATIONALISATION OF JURISDICTION OF
                            HIGH COURTS ACT, 2001

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the notice, which is the subject  of  the  select
committee's report, is brought before this House in  terms  of  the  Interim
Rationalisation of Jurisdiction of High Courts Act, Act No 41 of  2001.  The
need for this legislation arose out of the  anomalies  and  inequities  that
remain with us from the attempt  to  implement  the  ill-conceived  homeland
policy of the former NP government. There are  a  number  of  anomalies  and
inequities, the most glaring of which require the citizens of Thaba-Nchu  to
travel to Mafikeng to have access to a High  Court  when  there  is  a  High
Court in Bloemfontein, which they could access much more conveniently.

The legislation provides  for  interim  solutions  to  provide  for  greater
equity and efficiencies in access to High Courts. This does  not  mean  that
any of the role-players have lost sight of the need  to  implement  a  long-
term policy. The legislation provides that the hon Minister of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development may publish a notice in  the  Government  Gazette
altering the jurisdiction of  a  High  Court  after  consultation  with  the
Judicial Services Commission.

In the case of the notice before us, the hon Minister went  on  to  approach
the  respective  Judges  President  to  take  the  initiative.  The   Judges
President formed task teams to consider the relevant issues. The task  teams
were guided by the following criteria: Access  to  justice,  utilisation  of
resources,   constitutional   imperatives,   availability   of    resources,
suitability  of  areas   of   jurisdiction,   financial   implications   and
disparities in the old demarcation system.

This process may have taken some time, but was well worthwhile  because  all
the relevant issues have received due and proper consideration  and  a  high
degree of consensus was achieved.  After  the  task  teams  completed  their
investigations they made proposals to the hon Minister. Thereafter  the  hon
Minister  consulted  the  Judicial  Services  Commission  who  accepted  the
proposals with only one minor amendment.

I think it is important that I briefly list the  affected  areas.  The  Free
State Provincial Division will  gain  Thaba-Nchu;  the  Bophuthatswana  High
Court will lose Thaba-Nchu and gain Vryburg, Lichtenburg, Coligny,  Zeerust,
Groot-Marico, Swartruggens, Koster, Rustenburg and  Delareyville;  the  Cape
of  Good  Hope  Provincial  Division  will  lose  Willowmore,   Namaqualand,
Williston, Sutherland, Calvinia and Fraserberg; the  Eastern  Cape  Division
will gain Willowmore and lose Noupoort, Colesberg and Hanover; the  Northern
Cape  Division  will  gain  Namaqualand,  Williston,  Sutherland,  Calvinia,
Fraserberg,  Noupoort,  Colesberg,  Hanover,  and  will  lose  Vryburg;  the
Transvaal Provincial  Division  will  lose  Lichtenberg,  Coligny,  Zeerust,
Groot-Marico, Swartruggens, Koster, Rustenburg and Delareyville.

The select committee supports and agrees with  the  motivation  of  the  hon
Minister and  respectfully  urges  this  House  to  support  the  amendments
proposed by the Minister. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That concludes the debate. I  shall  now
put the question. The question is that the report be adopted.  The  decision
is dealt with in terms of Section  65  of  the  Constitution.  I  note  that
delegation heads are present in the Chamber  to  cast  the  votes  of  their
provinces.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces an opportunity  to
make a declaration of vote, if they wish. Is there any province  wishing  to
make a declaration of vote?

Mr  M  A  MZIZI  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  on  a   point   of   order:
Unfortunately this is probably the first time that some of us have heard  of
this report. We did not have an opportunity to take a good  look  at  it  to
see the shortfalls and  shortcomings  of  it.  I  do  not  know  whether  my
colleagues, the permanent delegates, had such  an  opportunity.  It  is  the
first time that I hear of it.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  Could  the  permanent  delegates  of
KwaZulu-Natal indicate whether they have participated  in  deliberations  on
this matter. The decision is dealt with in terms of Section 65, but  we  are
dealing with a Section 75 functional area, given that it is justice that  we
are deliberating  upon.  Is  there  any  member  of  the  province  who  has
participated?

Prince  N  E  ZULU:  Sihlalo,  bengiyingxenye  yazo  zonke   lezi   zingxoxo
zokwamukela lo mbiko. Siwesekela  ngakho  konke  esinakho.  [Chairperson,  I
have participated in all the discussions leading to  the  adoption  of  this
report. We support it without reservation.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! There you have  the  reply.  Given  that
there are no provinces wishing to make  a  declaration  of  vote,  we  shall
therefore  proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  This  will  be  done  in
aphabetical order per province. Delegation heads should please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour, against or abstain from  voting.  The
Eastern Cape?
Ms B N DLULANE: IMpuma Koloni iyaxhasa. [Eastern Cape supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Free State?

Mr T S SETONA: Free State supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Gauteng?

Mr B MABASO: Gauteng ya seketela. [Gauteng supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: KwaZulu-Natal?

Ms B THOMSON: KwaZulu-Natal ya seketela. [KwaZulu-Natal supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Limpopo? The  Limpopo  province?  I  think  the
member has forgotten the name of his province. [Laughter.]

Mr I MAKOELA: I'm not used  to  having  my  turn  so  early,  Chair.  Re  ae
amogela. [We accept it.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Mpumalanga?

Ms M P THEMBA: IMpumalanga iyawusekela. [Mpumalanga supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Northern Cape?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Northern Cape supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: North West?

Mr Z S KOLWENI: North West ke wa rona. [North West supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Western Cape? Western Cape? The  Western  Cape?
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: The  Western  Cape  therefore  abstains.  Eight
provinces have voted in favour. I  therefore  declare  the  report  adopted.
[Applause.]

Perhaps before we rise I should indicate to the special delegates  from  the
provinces that the Constitution is very clear with respect to  how  we  deal
with Bills, but it is less certain and guiding in terms of how we deal  with
other  pieces  of  work  such  as  the  interim  arrangement  we  have  been
deliberating upon now, which is a procedure that  is  to  be  gazetted.  The
Constitution mandates the National Council to decide in terms of section  65
whenever it is a matter other than matters that fall within  sections  75(1)
and 76(2) procedures. Hence the provincial participation.

That concludes the business of the day. The House is adjourned.

The Council adjourned at 18:04.

     Background


     On 15 May 2003, the Office of  the  Registrar  received  correspondence
     from Minister Lekota in which he tendered an apology to Parliament  for
     his non-disclosure of financial interests. The letter also gave details
     of his interests in BZL Petroleum CC 1169 and BZL Petroleum CC 1209.


     On 16 May 2003, the Mail and Guardian newspaper published an article on
     the non-disclosure of  financial  interests  by  Minister  Lekota.  The
     article refers to non-disclosure of BZL Petroleum as well  as  Minister
     Lekota's directorship in both Landzicht and Griekwaland-Wes  KoÃ¶perasie
     (GWK).


     On the same day Minister Lekota submitted  details  pertaining  to  his
     directorships of Landzicht and GWK. Minister Lekota explained  that  he
     acquired his directorship of GWK in October 2002 and therefore in terms
     of the rules is only required to disclose it in the 2003 disclosure.


     Mr D M Gibson, MP, submitted a complaint on 16 May 2003  regarding  the
     Minister's non-disclosure.


     On 16 May 2003 the Minister was advised of the complaint, and asked  to
     furnish full details of his interests.


     Minister Lekota's disclosure
     The Minister complied with the request to  disclose  and  provided  the
     following additions to his existing disclosures:


     1999
     Residential property - Bloemfontien
     Residential property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investments
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of Trustees
     2000
     Residential Property - Bloemfontein
     Residential Property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investment
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of trustees
     Member of Grey College School Governing Body


     2001
     Residential Property - Bloemfontein
     Residential Property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investment
     Directorship - Landzicht Winery
     Shares - BZL Petroleum 1169 CC
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of trustees
     Member of Grey College School Governing Body


     2002
     Residential Property - Bloemfontein
     Residential Property - Westville
     Directorship - Mokolla Investment
     Directorship - Landzicht Winery
     Shares - BZL Petroleum 1169 CC
     Trustee - Braam Fischer Board of trustees
     Member of Grey College School Governing Body
     The Minister's directorships as forwarded were found to  be  consistent
     with search results of the Department of Trade  and  Industry  -  CIPRO
     Website.


     Breaches of the Code
     Item 16 of the Code of Conduct stipulates that a  member  breaches  the
     Code if the member -


         (a)     Contravenes or fails to comply  with  a  provision  of  the
              Code,
         (b)     When disclosing registrable  interests,  wilfully  provides
              the Registrar with incorrect or misleading details.


     Consideration of the complaint
     Minister Lekota has publicly conceded that he  has  not  disclosed  the
     aforementioned interests. A hearing is not required because  the  facts
     are not in dispute.  However,  the  Committee  must  establish  whether
     Minister Lekota's non-disclosure was due to negligence  or  whether  he
     intended to wilfully mislead the Committee.


     Item 3.3 of the Procedure for the Investigation  of  Complaints  allow,
     "in each case the committee has the discretion regarding the weight  to
     be attached to different forms of evidence..."


     The Committee agreed that it  must  make  a  finding  of  willful  non-
     disclosure if it is found that the Minister or his family,  friends  or
     associates improperly benefitted financially or otherwise from his non-
     disclosure. The Committee must assess whether the non-disclosure  arose
     to conceal a conflict of interest.


     In terms of the criteria outlined above, consideration must be given to
     the Mail and Guardian's  analysis  of  the  conflict  of  interests  in
     respect of this matter. The report states that "Lekota's involvement in
     the businesses raise serious conflict of interests questions as  Lekota
     is in the position to use his influence and has  access  to  privileged
     information that could advance his business interests."  The  newspaper
     continues, " the fact that BZL is a distribution agency of  Caltex  and
     the fact that Lekota is  a  shareholder  of  BZL  arguably  brings  him
     uncomfortably close to the petroleum giant. In this case  the  conflict
     of interest arises from the fact that Lekota sits in  Cabinet  meetings
     that make decisions that affect fuel companies".


     With the information at hand  it  is  the  Committee's  view  that  the
     newspaper does not make a case that  there  is  a  direct  conflict  of
     interest. Further there  is  no  evidence  before  the  Committee  that
     indicate that the Minister had benefitted  financially  from  his  non-
     disclosure. At most it could be said that the Minister's interest could
     create a perception of a potential conflict of interest.


     The Mail and Guardian continues, "Landzicht is a  regular  supplier  of
     wines to the Free State Government." The article also states Trade  and
     Investment South Africa paid 80% of  Landzicht's  exhibitions  held  in
     Thailand, Beijing and Uganda.


     In respect of the  Minister's  interests  in  Landzicht,  details  were
     obtained from Trade and Investment South Africa (TISA) on  the  funding
     of the exhibitions. They (TISA) have indicated that Minister Lekota was
     at no stage directly involved in dealing  with  any  application.  They
     have only a record of the exhibition in Uganda.


     Minister Lekota's Address to the Committee
     The Minister at the outset apologised for his failure to  disclose.  He
     conceded that he erred in not forwarding full details of his disclosure
     and accepts that he failed to abide with the requirements of the Code.


     In respect of  the  Minister's  non-disclosure  of  his  residences  in
     Westville and Bloemfontein, he stated that these are private residences
     and that no business activity was conducted from these premises.


     In respect of shares in BZL 1169 CC, the Minister indicated that he had
     at no time  drawn  any  benefit  and  advised  that  the  business  has
     undergone liquidation. The Minister is credited with a dividend and has
     not drawn it to date.


     In respect of BZL 1209, the Minister has a 5% share at a nominal  value
     of R5. The Minister has indicated that the company value  is  difficult
     to determine, but is not likely  to  be  significant.  He  received  no
     remuneration or benefit to date and has now  tendered  his  resignation
     from BZL Petroleum.


     With regard to Landzicht, the Minister  has  partially  disclosed  this
     interest, including the wine farm in Jacobsdal. He received no  payment
     from Landzicht. The Minister has indicated that there is no contract to
     supply wine to the government of the  Free  State  as  alleged  in  the
     newspaper report.


     Griekwaland-Wes KoÃ¶perasie (GWK)
     The Minister was invited  to  serve  as  a  non-executive  director  in
     October 2002, as such he would only be required to  disclose  in  2003.
     The Minister did not receive any benefits. He tendered his  resignation
     to GWK.


     Mokolla Investments
     The Minister indicated that this is a dormant  company  and  has  never
     traded.


     Braam Fischer Board of Trustees
     This is a trust to assist rural children; he derives  no  benefit  from
     this.


     Grey School Governing Body
     The Minister does not derive any benefits from this body.


     Based on the information at its disposal, the Committee is of the  view
     that the Minister's failure to disclose  was  negligent,  but  did  not
     intend to wilfully mislead the Committee.


     Recommendations
     The Joint Committee makes the finding that:


         -  Minister Lekota failed to comply  with  the  provisions  of  the
              Code of Conduct with regard to financial interests;
         -  Minister Lekota was negligent in making  incomplete  disclosures
              of his interests;
         -  However, that there was no evidence that the  Minister  wilfully
              withheld information with the intention to mislead Parliament;
              and
         -  Therefore, sanctions his negligence.


     In terms of the provisions of the Code the Joint  Committee  on  Ethics
     and  Members'  Interests  recommends  to  the  National  Assembly   the
     following sanctions:


         (i)     a written  reprimand  from  the  Speaker  of  the  National
                  Assembly; and
         (ii)    a fine which is the  equivalent  of  one  week's  (7  days)
                  salary.


     In making these recommendations, the  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics  and
     Members' Interests wishes to emphasise that Members  of  Parliament  as
     elected public representatives have an obligation to be transparent and
     must take the provisions of the Code seriously.


     The  Committee  noted  the  promptness  with  which   Minister   Lekota
     responded, his own admission of a casualness in regard  to  disclosure,
     and his co-operative demeanour.


     The Committee was unanimous in its findings.


     Adopted unanimously by the Committee on 27 May 2003.

2.    Report of the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of
     Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons on  Filling  of
     Vacancies on National Youth Commission, dated 27 May 2003:
     The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of  Life  and
     Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons, having  considered  the
     request from the Minister in The Presidency regarding  the  appointment
     of Commissioners to serve on the National Youth Commission, referred to
     it, reports as follows:


     1.     Advertisements were placed in the printed and  electronic  media
         from 2 to 17 April 2003, and the Committee received 72  nominations
         (15 females, 53 males and four disabled persons).  On  20  May  the
         Committee shortlisted the following nominees for interviews:


         Jabu Mbalula, DaniÃ«l van Vuuren, Nketu Matime,  Petronella  Linders
         (visually  impaired),  Cameron  Tabane,  Lebogang  Maile,   Vuyiswa
         Tulelo-Rathebe, Anele Matoti, Simon Zwane  (paraplegic),  Sthembele
         Peter (epilepsy) and Mpande Cele.


         On 22 May, a day before  the  interviews  were  scheduled  to  take
         place, Mpande Cele  withdrew  his  nomination,  and  the  Committee
         therefore ultimately interviewed 10 candidates.
     2.     On 23 May, the Committee spent five hours interviewing the  said
         10 candidates. The  principle  of  concurrence  with  the  National
         Council of Provinces, and the terms of reference  as  contained  in
         the National Youth Commission Act, 1996, (Act No. 19 of  1996),  as
         well as the appointment of five full-time commissioners, were  duly
         taken into account during the entire process.


     3.     The Committee accordingly recommends, in accordance with section
         4 of the National Youth Commission Act,  1996,  that  the  National
         Assembly and  the  National  Council  of  Provinces  recommend  the
         following five candidates for consideration by the  President  when
         appointing  five  full-time   members   to   the   National   Youth
         Commission:


         Jabu Mbalula
         DaniÃ«l van Vuuren
         Nketu Matime
         Petronella Linders
         Vuyiswa Tulelo-Rathebe.
