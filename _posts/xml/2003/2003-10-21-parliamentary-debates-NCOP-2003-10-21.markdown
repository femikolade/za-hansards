                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I give notice that at the  next  sitting  of  the
Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the  findings  of  leading  research  group,  Proactive
       Surveys, which found that -


       (a)  democracy in South  Africa  since  1994  has  benefited  only  a
           minority of the population;


       (b)  fewer than one in five people believe that the system works  for
           everyone;


       (c)  when asked whether life was changing for  the  better  in  South
           Africa, the majority said that it was not;


       (d)  70% state that the ANC is not living up to expectations;


       (e)  only 5% believe that the Government is  doing  enough  to  fight
           crime; and


       (f)  former President Mandela is believed by 78,7% of the  people  to
           be a better leader than President Thabo Mbeki; and
  (2) therefore resolves that the ANC is showing all the symptoms of ruling-
       party fatigue, which one finds in democracies, and which provides the
       first signs of an eventual change in government.

Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Deputy President  Jacob  Zuma  has  stated  repeatedly  that  he
           regretted that there  would  not  be  a  criminal  case  brought
           against him, which would enable him to  tell  his  side  of  the
           story in court;


       (b)  Deputy President Zuma does not need a court  case  to  tell  his
           story;


       (c)  he could call a press  conference  or  make  use  of  any  other
           occasion to enlighten the public about his defence; and


  (2) therefore resolves to invite Deputy President Zuma  to  this  Council
       for the purpose of participating in a special debate which would give
       him every opportunity of clearing his name and would give the members
       of this Council the opportunity of questioning him and  debating  his
       replies.

                     CONDUCT OF AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the South African ambassador  to  Indonesia,  Ambassador  Norman
           Mashabane, is still in this position nearly two years  since  he
           had been found guilty on 21 charges of sexual harassment;


       (b)  subsequently other similar charges have been  laid  against  the
           ambassador; and


       (c)  the person who claims sexual  harassment  has  been  removed  to
           Korea; and


  (2) whereas Ambassador Mashabane has remained in his position, recommends
       that -


       (a)  the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister Nkosazana Zuma,  deals
           with the appeal proceedings with the utmost urgency;


       (b)  Ambassador Mashabane at least be placed on special  leave  until
           such time as the proceedings are finalised; and


       (c)  the ambassador's reported claim that  he  will  not  be  removed
           because he is a presidential appointment, be investigated.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion will, therefore, become notice of a motion.

                    COMMENDING PRESIDENT FOR INDIAN VISIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move a motion without notice that:


  That the Council -


  (1) commends President Thabo Mbeki  on  the  successful  state  visit  to
       India;


  (2) believes the visit reflects the  deep  historical  link  between  our
       countries,  and  specifically  the  similarities  in  terms  of   the
       developmental challenges that need to be overcome;


  (3) acknowledges that the end of colonialism has not  brought  peace  and
       security to Asia and Africa, nor has there been progress  toward  the
       democratisation of international relations;


  (4) is of the opinion that India and South Africa,  by  virtue  of  their
       struggles  for  freedom,  which  attracted  world-wide  interest  and
       support, are uniquely qualified to promote unity between  Africa  and
       Asia and to rally support of public opinion in the rest of the  world
       for this purpose; and


  (5) therefore welcomes the commitment undertaken by the  two  governments
       to  work   together   in   a   strategic   partnership   to   address
       underdevelopment and to reaffirm their common outlook of a new  world
       order in which democracy, peace and prosperity prevail everywhere.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               READMISSION OF BRAM FISCHER TO BAR ASSOCIATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) commends the South African Bar Association for restoring the  dignity
       of and readmitting the late Abram  (Bram)  Fischer  to  the  roll  of
       jurists in South Africa; and


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  he was struck off the roll  for  his  courageous  opposition  to
           apartheid, racism, sexism and British colonialism;


       (b)  he refused to put on the cadet uniform at Grey  College  because
           of its British roots;


       (c)  he was a son of the soil and a staunch Free Stater who practised
           as an advocate in Johannesburg  and  was  a  King's  Counsel  in
           London;


       (d)  among his many illustrious contributions to the struggle and the
           country,  was  his  assistance  with   the   revision   of   the
           constitution of the ANC in 1943;


       (e)  on 3 November 1965 he was struck off the roll of  advocates  and
           was rejected by his own ethnic community, yet  dearly  loved  by
           all of us;


       (f)  he embraced everyone and was loved by all for his gentleness and
           readiness to help beyond race, colour, religion and gender in  a
           jovial and humorous way; and


       (g)  he will  always  be  remembered  for  his  strong  qualities  of
           leadership and compassion and his very sharp intellect.


       He dared to be a Daniel;
       he dared to stand alone;
       he dared to have his purpose true;
       and dared to make it known.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that recently the following groups, inter alia, have called for
       a moratorium on  the  further  use  and  application  of  genetically
       modified organisms (GMOs):
       (a)  US National Family Farmers Coalition and other farm groups;


       (b)  National Farmers Union (Canada); and


       (c)  British Medical Association;


  (2) also notes that this comes on top of  the  very  recent  official  UK
       government survey, testing 37 000 respondents in the UK, which  found
       that -


       (a)  93% agree that not enough is known about  the  long-term  health
           effects of the GM foods - only 5% disagree;


       (b)  85% agree GM  crops  would  mainly  benefit  producers  and  not
           ordinary people - only 8% disagree;


       (c)  91% agree that there are potential negative effects of GM  crops
           on the environment - only 7% disagree;


       (d)  93% agree that GM technology is driven more by profit  than  the
           public interest - only 6% disagree;


       (e)  only 8% are happy to eat GM foods - 86% disagree; and


       (f)  84% agree that GM is an unacceptable interference with nature  -
           only 10% disagree;


  (3) notes further that only last  week  the  company  that  owns  91%  of
       patents on GM seeds grown worldwide announced that it is pulling  out
       of  the  European  cereals  business  and   putting   its   Cambridge
       headquarters in the UK up for sale, as well as its cereal development
       stations at Cambridge, England and in France, Germany and  the  Czech
       Republic, following the hardening resistance to GM  crops  throughout
       Europe; and


  (4) thus re-affirms its call for an immediate moratorium on the  use  and
       introduction of GMOs into South Africa, at least until  comprehensive
       and credible research has been done on the possible damaging  effects
       to the environment, to public health and to our exports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion will, therefore, become notice of a motion.

       and their candidate for premier, Mr Theuns Botha, has  been  referred

                POSTAL SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL REFERRED BACK
            TO SELECT COMMITTEE ON LABOUR AND PUBLIC ENTERPRISES

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council refers the Postal Services Amendment Bill [B 40 -  2003]
  back to the Select Committee on Labour and Public Enterprises for further
  consideration.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             ARMAMENTS CORPORATION OF SOUTH AFRICA, LIMITED BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Chairperson, members of  the  Council,
one of the responsibilities that  we  carry  is  that  of  carefully  taking
charge of our inheritance from history and to reshape that to  better  serve
the interests of our  people  and  our  country.  One  such  inheritance  is
Armscor, created in 1968 at the  height  of  apartheid.  Armscor  had  major
functions. These were the development and manufacturing  of  armaments,  the
acquisition of armaments on behalf of the then South African Defence  Force,
and control over export and import of armaments into or  from  the  Republic
of South Africa.

With the ushering in of democracy in 1994 and the change in posture  of  the
SA National Defence Force from an offensive to a defensive one, a number  of
measures were taken by Government to restrict and contain the  movement  and
supply of arms into and out  of  South  Africa.  Firstly,  the  development,
manufacturing  and  sales  of  armaments  were  transferred  to   a   wholly
commercial enterprise, Denel. Secondly, control over conventional  armaments
was  transferred  to  the  National  Conventional  Arms  Control  Committee.
Thirdly, the creation of  the  Defence  Secretariat  led  to  greater  civil
control over the acquisition process by the Department of Defence.

These changes led to  a  review  of  the  role,  functions  and  mandate  of
Armscor. The  new  Bill  was  drawn  up  in  consultation  with  four  other
government departments, the South African Aerospace,  Maritime  and  Defence
Industry  Association  and  the  Centre  for  Conflict  Resolution  at   the
University  of  Cape  Town.  The  objectives  were  to  meet  the   material
requirements  of  the  Department  of  Defence  and  to  meet  the   defence
technology   research,   development,   analysis,   test   and    evaluation
requirements of  the  department.  Its  functions  are  to  acquire  defence
material on behalf of the department and to manage technological projects.

The affairs of Armscor  will  be  managed  and  controlled  by  a  board  of
directors. There are rules governing the chief executive officer, the  Chief
Financial  Officer,  nonexecutive  board   members,   board   meetings   and
decisions. The Bill covers conflict of interest and possible punishment  for
failure by board members and employees to disclose. The Bill explains  where
the  corporation's  funds  must  come  from,  the  audit  of  its  financial
statements and a system for evaluating  acquisitions.  Clause  3(2)  of  the
Bill enjoins the corporation to  adhere  to  accepted  corporate  governance
principles,  best  business  practices  and  generally  accepted  accounting
practices. These are intended to  promote  fairness,  equity,  transparency,
economy, efficiency, accountability and lawfulness.

It is with this in mind that we have supported the amendments  made  by  the
Select Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs,  which  deals  with
conflict of interests. By broadening the scope of  declaration  of  conflict
of interest, this Bill strengthens  our  Government's  drive  to  stamp  out
corruption.

The issue of the composition of the board and the role thereon of the  Chief
of the SA National Defence Force need further scrutiny. The  decision  taken
by Cabinet in this regard  was  in  the  interest  of  good  governance  and
accountability, when it was said that the Chief of the SA  National  Defence
Force should not serve on the board, and this was a correct decision.

The  Bill  spells  out  delegations  of  the  board,  the  safeguarding   of
information, records, property  and  premises,  intellectual  property  laws
that have to be repealed and so on. The Bill  further  stipulates  that  the
state remains the sole shareholder of the corporation and that the  Minister
exercises ownership control on behalf of the state.

In this regard, I would like to also mention that  the  Bill  is  strong  on
black economic empowerment and I would like  to  refer  to  clause  4(2)(e),
which says that the tender and contract system required  in  terms  of  this
provision is geared towards promoting Black Economic  Empowerment  companies
and to this end, Armscor has established a Black Economic  Empowerment  unit
to ensure participation of  Black  Economic  Empowerment  companies  in  the
acquisition process of defence material.

The redefining of the role of  Armscor  has  not  been  an  easy  task.  The
balance had to be found between limiting the activities of  the  corporation
while  not  suffocating  the  industry.  There  were  particular  areas   of
difficulty around reporting lines and the role of the Defence Secretary  and
the acquisition division in the Defence Secretariat. This has  finally  been
worked out, helped by the active participation  of  members  of  the  Select
Committee on Security and Constitutional Affairs.

I would  like  to  acknowledge  the  role  in  this  regard  played  by  the
chairperson of the committee, Kgoshi Mokoena, and to formally thank  him  on
behalf of the Department of Defence and of the defence industry as  a  whole
for his positive contribution, assisted naturally  by  the  members  of  the
committee. I thank you.

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, there was  a  time  in  this  country  when
armaments were manufactured for the wrong reasons. The  arms  were  sold  or
given to the wrong people, for that matter.

It is for this reason that Armscor had to be transformed. There  is  no  way
in this day and age that we are  going  to  allow  weapons  to  be  used  to
suppress people, as was the case in the  past.  Arms  were  manufactured  to
suppress the majority of South  Africans,  and,  sporadically,  against  our
brothers and sisters in the frontline states.

As we are all aware, Armscor's vision today is to be a truly  South  African
organisation that is valued, locally and globally, as a centre of  technical
excellence for defence acquisition and support services. We  are  proud  and
satisfied that the state remains the sole shareholder  in  the  corporation,
and especially to note or realise  that  the  Minister  exercises  ownership
control over the corporation on behalf of the state.

This corporation will be managed by a board of  directors,  as  was  rightly
stated by the Deputy Minister. These are people who must make sure that  the
corporation is run efficiently, diligently,  effectively,  and  that  it  is
economically viable.

The committee proposed some amendments to clause 14 of the Bill,  as  stated
by our hon, dynamic and calculated Deputy  Minister.  This  is  the  section
that deals with the conflict of interest. It requires members of  the  board
to disclose to the board any direct or indirect interest  that  such  member
or his or her spouse, partner or family  member  may  have  in  any  matters
relating to the acquisition or procurement activities of the corporation.

We didn't have a problem with the clause as it stands, but our problem  was:
How do you define a family member? If  I  were  to  pose  this  question  to
members of this House, namely ``who are  your  family  members?'',  I  would
definitely get different answers. Even though it  took  us  two  solid  days
debating this clause, among other things, we finally  reached  consensus  to
remove the word "family member". That's my committee, Chairperson.

Our thanks goes to officials in this department who responded accurately  to
all our concerns. It was for that reason that members felt  that  we  should
not field many speakers in this debate, because we are all singing the  same
song. Again, it is also because there is nothing  controversial  about  this
Bill.

The question of regulations and other  issues  will  be  dealt  with  by  my
colleagues. What pleases me is that this House  is  going  to  support  this
Bill. Chairperson, I have spoken. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I  heard  an  hon  member  whisper
that the committee was singing as a family. [Laughter.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon Chairperson, hon  members,  by  its  very  nature  and
strategic importance, one would  expect  Armscor  to  enjoy  free  reign  in
whatever it wants to do. This is  not  the  case,  hon  members,  especially
after this Bill has become law.

At face value, the Bill before us is of a light nature,  running  just  over
12 pages. But I assure you, hon members, that the details in  the  Bill  are
sufficient to transform this parastatal and  tighten  control  by  both  the
department and the Defence Secretariat.
The objectives and functions of this corporation spell out clearly what  the
refocused Armscor sets out to do and how it will conduct its  business.  One
of the crucial matters I wish to highlight, amongst its  functions,  is  the
responsibility to comply with international law with regard to  the  control
of  conventional  arms,  which  strictly  prohibits  the  sale  of  arms  to
illegitimate regimes or bandits in  the  outside  world,  where  these  arms
could be used to maim innocent civilians and support irresponsible  regimes.
In any event, the Ministry, the department and  the  Secretary  for  Defence
are all central to whatever initiative or action Armscor undertakes.

Furthermore, the requirement that the corporation should enter into  service
level agreements with the department ensures  that  the  corporation  always
remains within its mandate.

Financial management is also addressed in this Bill,  with  the  stipulation
of the sources and utilisation of the  corporation's  finances.  Apart  from
its own internal audit, the Department of  Defence's  auditor  has,  at  all
reasonable times, access to all documentation pertaining  to  service  level
agreements between the corporation and the department.  Section  58  of  the
Public Finance Management Act also applies to the  corporation  with  regard
to the auditing of its annual financial statements.

The  issue  of  corporate  governance  within  the   corporation   is   also
strengthened and updated to be  on  par  with  recent  developments  in  the
corporate  world.  The  composition  of  executive  and  nonexecutive  board
members, and the committees, is structured in such a way as  to  effect  the
necessary checks and balances, including peer review,  to  ensure  that  the
corporation will run its business in an honest, transparent,  objective  and
accountable manner.

The cherry on top in respect of this Bill is the issue of  the  conflict  of
interest that it addresses extensively and explicitly.  As  the  chairperson
of the committee has highlighted, we spent hours on this issue debating  how
we could curtail instances of corruption. But, typical  of  this  committee,
we were assisted by our own very objective treatment of legislation. We  had
to refocus on what this Bill seeks to do, and we came to the answer that  it
seeks to address the issue of corruption. So we  retained  that  section  of
the Bill as it stands now.

I am sure hon members will all find their way clear to support this Bill.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, it's always  difficult  when  you  are  a  fourth
speaker in a debate of this nature, but most of what needs to  be  said  has
been said and I'll, therefore, be very brief, summarise and skim over  areas
that have already been dealt with.

This Bill provides for the continued existence of the Armaments  Corporation
of South Africa, Limited, commonly known as Armscor. Despite the  repeal  of
the Armaments Development and Production Act,  the  state  will  remain  the
sole shareholder of Armscor and the Minister of Defence  will  exercise  the
rights of ownership and control over Armscor on behalf of the state.

As a juristic person, Armscor will be entitled to sue and  be  sued  in  its
own name. It will be able to buy, hold or sell both  movable  and  immovable
property. The Bill prevents any  person  from  using  or  abusing  Armscor's
name.

The objectives of Armscor Limited are twofold: firstly, to meet the  defence
material  requirements  of  the  department  efficiently,  effectively   and
economically;  secondly,  to  meet   the   defence   technology,   research,
development, analysis, test and evaluation requirements of  the  department,
also effectively, efficiently and economically.

The  Bill  prescribes  that  Armscor  must  adhere  to  accepted   corporate
governance principles and generally accepted accounting practices, and  that
it must do so in a manner  that  reflects  fairness,  equity,  transparency,
economy, efficiency, accountability and lawfulness.

The Bill sets out how the board of  directors  will  be  made  up.  It  also
states that the board will be the  accounting  authority  in  terms  of  the
Public Finance Management Act. Members of  the  National  Assembly  and  the
NCOP who may be looking for  jobs  in  a  few  months  and  those  from  the
provincial legislatures and municipal councillors may not be members of  the
board. Subject to the exceptions of the Secretary for Defence and the  Chief
of the SANDF, no public servant may serve on the board.

In relation  to  potential  conflicts  of  interest,  the  select  committee
simplified the language and broadened the ambit of  when  a  member  of  the
board or an employee of Armscor must disclose to the  board  any  direct  or
indirect interest in any matter relating to procurement.

Here I wish to emphasise  the  key  word,  and  the  emphasis  on  the  word
"disclosure". There must be disclosure, and the chairperson of the board  or
the procurement committee will have the discretion to decide on whether  the
matter warrants anybody recusing himself further.
In relation to the provision on regulations, the  select  committee  deleted
provisions that fall within the purview of  the  intelligence  community  in
order to avoid duplication of  potential  conflicts.  The  select  committee
also determined that regulations in terms of section  18  (1)(g)  should  be
tabled in Parliament before they are published  to  ensure  that  Parliament
fulfils its obligations in terms of oversight of delegated legislation.

The DA supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Agb Voorsitter, dis 'n voorreg om oor hierdie wetgewing  te
kan praat. Ek gaan dit maar 'n bietjie uit  'n  ander  hoek  benader  as  my
kollegas.

Die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies het hom oor die jare bewys dat hy sy  plek
waardig is, soos wat die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika  dit  vir  hom  uiteensit.
As, onder andere, 'n Huis van hersiening, doen hy uitnemende  werk.  Hierdie
Huis het al by verskeie geleenthede amendemente  gemaak  aan  wetgewing  wat
baie belangrik is. In hierdie wetgewing wat vanoggend onder  bespreking  is,
het agb kollegas na amendemente  verwys  wat  uit  die  aard  van  die  saak
belangrik is en wat deur hierdie komitee gemaak is.

Wat egter hinder, is dat daar nou 'n neiging ontstaan het in  die  Nasionale
Vergadering dat wanneer artikel 75-wetgewing bespreek word,  hulle  'n  tipe
alleenreg  vir  hulself  toe-eien.  Daar  word  selfs  deur  hulle  aan  die
President voorgeskryf op watter datum hy 'n wet  moet  onderteken.  Daardeur
plaas hulle geweldige druk op hierdie Huis om wetgewing goed te keur  sonder
dat ons werklik voldoende aandag daaraan kan gee. En ek wil dit vandag  hier
uitwys dat ons dit ten sterkste moet teenstaan.

Dit is hoekom, toe die komitee oor hierdie wetgewing besluit het,  die  Nuwe
NP besluit het om buite stemming te bly.  Waarom  moes  ons  buite  stemming
bly? Ons is ontevrede oor die feit dat die konsultasieproses nie voltrek  is
nie. Denel is 'n redelik belangrike rolspeler en is  ontevrede  omdat  hulle
nie by die konsultasie voldoende betrek is nie. Selfs die antwoord  wat  ons
van die departement gekry het, dat  hulle  tot  op  'n  sekere  stadium  nie
betrek is nie, is onaanvaarbaar.

Die ander punt waaroor ons buite stemming gebly het, is die  feit  dat  daar
'n openbare verhoor was in die Nasionale Vergadering. Ons het  geen  verslag
gekry oor daardie openbare verhoor nie. Die departement  het  gesit  met  'n
volledige verslag en, toe ons navraag doen, toe  sê  hulle  hulle  het  dit.
Maar waarom het hulle nie mettertyd die goed vir ons aangegee  nie?  In  die
Nasionale Vergadering word die komitee se  openbare  vergaderings  eenvoudig
gereël, selfs al pas dit nie in ons programme nie en ons kan  nie  die  goed
bywoon nie. Daarom teken ek vandag ten sterkte beswaar hierteen aan. Ek  wys
dit uit, want ek dink dis nodig dat ons daaraan sal aandag gee.  En  dit  is
waarom ons in die komitee buite stemming gebly  het,  maar  uiteraard  omdat
hierdie wetgewing belangrik is, sal ons daarvoor stem. Dankie.  (Translation

[Mr C ACKERMANN: Hon Chairperson, it is a privilege to be able to  speak  on
this legislation. I am going to approach it from a different angle  than  my
colleagues.

The National Council of Provinces has proven that it  is  deserving  of  its
place as contained in the Constitution of South Africa. As, among others,  a
House of revision, it is doing excellent work. This  House  has  on  various
occasions  made  very  important  amendments   to   legislation.   In   this
legislation that is under discussiom this morning hon  colleagues  naturally
referred to amendments that  are  important  and  that  were  made  by  this
committee.

However, what is worrying is that a tendency has developed in  the  National
Assembly that whenever section  75  legislation  is  discussed,  they  grant
themselves a type of monopoly. They  even  prescribe  to  the  President  on
which date he must sign an Act. In so doing they place enormous pressure  on
this House to approve legislation without our really being  able  to  afford
it sufficient attention. And I want to point out here  today  that  we  must
vehemently oppose this.

That is why, when the committee decided about this legislation, the  New  NP
decided to abstain  from  voting.  Why  did  we  have  to  abstain?  We  are
dissatisfied with the fact that the consultation  process  was  not  carried
out. Denel is a relatively important role-player and  is  dissatisfied  that
they were not sufficiently involved in  the  consultation.  Even  the  reply
that we received from the department, that up to a certain stage  they  were
not consulted, is unacceptable.

Another reason for abstaining from voting is the fact that a public  hearing
took place in the National Assembly. We have not received any  report  about
that public hearing. The department had a full  report  in  its  possession,
and they confirmed this when we enquired about it.  But  why  did  they  not
pass it on to us in due course? In the National Assembly public meetings  of
the committees are simply arranged,  even  if  they  do  not  fit  into  our
programmes and even if we are unable to  attend  them.  That  is  why  I  am
putting on record my strongest objection to this today. I am  pointing  this
out, because I think that it is necessary for us to give attention to  this.
And that  is  why  we,  in  the  committees,  abstained.  But  because  this
legislation is important, we will naturally vote in  favour  of  it.  [Thank
you.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, hon members, the darkness  that  has  shrouded
our  country  has  now  taken  the  form  of  flames  of  peace.  Democracy,
understanding, reconciliation and unity now engulf  this  beautiful  country
of ours. As we carry out this task and the mandate that we have  been  given
by the majority of people in this country, we know that ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, I note that we have in  the
House a number of future leaders of South Africa. I note that  a  number  of
them cannot see the member who is speaking. So I wonder, hon Lubidla,  if  I
could ask you to approach the microphone in the centre  so  that  those  new
and future leaders of South Africa may see you as they listen to you.

Welcome to the National Council of Provinces and Parliament. [Applause.]

Thank you very much, hon member. I apologise for interrupting you.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Madam Chair, allow me to start all over again.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Continue, hon member.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: The darkness that has shrouded our country  has  now  taken
the form of flames of peace. Democracy,  understanding,  reconciliation  and
unity now engulf this beautiful country of ours. As we carry out  this  task
and the mandate that we have been given by the majority of  people  in  this
country, we know that a mammoth task  awaits  us.  And  we  are  aware  that
governing is never easy.

Our people see  that  the  ANC-led  Government  takes  qualitative  and  new
initiatives that are consonant with our policies in the  reconstruction  and
development of our country.
The scribes of the enemy of our  people  are  today  poised  over  countless
notebooks. They write daily and send out myths by saying  that  the  ANC-led
Government has failed the people and that it is of  no  consequence  to  the
future  of  our  country.  As  everybody  here  today  knows,  there  is  no
organisation that is as committed to  the  upliftment  and  provision  of  a
better life for all the people in our country as the  ANC  is.  This  should
inspire us even more to bring the reality to our  people,  especially  those
in the rural areas.

Many people who were previously disadvantaged in our country today say  that
they are enjoying the fruits of freedom that the ANC has brought. This  does
not mean that we should rest on our laurels, but that this is the time  that
we worked much harder to bring the fruits of freedom to our people.

It is clear that in the past nine years since the ANC came to power a  great
deal of progress has been made towards making the lives  of  ordinary  South
Africans better. Questions are being raised  by  our  detractors  about  the
effectiveness  of  our  policies,  the   possibility   of   their   adoption
universally and their impact on our people. But we can say that the  ANC  is
striving to make a better life for our people. As we  said  when  we  fought
against our oppressors, we will continue to say to  our  people  that  there
are no easy victories.

There  are  pointers,  very  clear  pointers,  that  our  people   are   not
disillusioned, as some would want us to believe. At the same  time,  we  are
fully aware that the new democratic order  has  to  address  burning  issues
such as freedom from hunger, disease, ignorance, homelessness and poverty.

The ANC considers it a  matter  of  some  concern  that  the  falsifications
peddled by some about the nature and purposes of the ANC seem to find  ready
acceptance in some circles in this country. We have never  hidden  anything,
and we are somewhat puzzled that there are people today  who  ascribe  to  a
secret agenda. We, in the ANC, have none  and  we  are  aware  that  we  are
confronted by the issue  of  high  food  prices,  which  further  entrenches
poverty and suffering among the masses of our people.

As committee members, together  with  the  SA  National  Defence  Force  and
Armaments Corporation of South Africa, we  agreed  that  this  House  should
have an  oversight  role  when  it  comes  to  clause  18(g),  dealing  with
regulations and delegation by the Minister of Defence. This will  allow  our
House to  familiarise  themselves  with  the  regulations  before  they  are
implemented.

The ANC also understands that the objectives of  transforming  South  Africa
into a nonracial, nonsexist and  prosperous  democracy  have  not  yet  been
achieved. We are committed to the eradication of poverty and can  never  say
that our work is done while the suffering of our people in rural  areas  and
the blight of squatter camps that surround our towns and cities continue.

Changing the South African society in  a  manner  that  decisively  improves
people's quality of life  requires  boldness  in  thinking  that  shakes  up
convenient comfort zones. This is the reason we should  work  hard  to  make
our masses' hope a reality - as our President, Thabo Mbeki, says, ``The  sun
must rise for the poor too.'' This reality we must make without any  apology
whatsoever. Because the ANC is in government, it is constantly  expected  to
deal with the legacy of the apartheid regime, within nine  years  of  coming
to power.

Finally, the  ANC  agrees  and  endorses  the  amendments  proposed  by  the
committee. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER  OF  DEFENCE:  Chairperson,  I  want  to  start  off  by
thanking  the  members  of  the  select   committee   for   their   positive
contribution to the drafting of this Bill. In terms of the  amendments  that
have been proposed, we have definitely supported them. I wanted  to  mention
that one of the amendments deals with the issue of  the  security  clearance
of employees. We thank the committee  for  addressing  this  matter  and  we
support their amendment as  well  as  the  amendment  that  relates  to  the
drafting of regulations covered under section 18(1). We support this.
I wanted to say something about the process of passing legislation.  In  the
10 years that most of us have been in this House,  we  have  grown  familiar
with the procedure of how a Bill becomes a law. During that  process,  there
are many opportunities for each and every one of us to make  an  input  with
regard to shaping that particular piece of legislation.  I  am  saying  this
with regard to the concerns  raised  by  the  hon  Ackermann  regarding  the
process of consultation.

In the report presented to the select  committee  by  the  department  on  8
October 2003, the process of consultation was outlined. For  the  record,  I
want  to  say  that  present  in  the  committee  that  helped  draft   this
legislation were a number of stakeholders. Among them  were  the  Department
of Defence itself and the Department of Public Enterprises,  represented  by
the Denel legal division. There were also a  number  of  other  departments,
such as Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry, and Treasury, as  well  as  the
National Conventional Arms Control Committee.

I am not very clear on  what  the  member  is  concerned  about,  but  I  am
grateful to him for having supported the Bill. I want to inform him that  he
and  his  party  have  an  opportunity  to   familiarise   themselves   with
legislation at different stages. It is important  that  he  participates  in
this.

Once again, I want to thank the committee  because  it  has  shown  that  it
takes work that has been given to it very seriously.  The  report  that  was
presented here was that  the  committee  took  a  lot  of  time  looking  at
different issues in this Bill and in particular the  issue  of  conflict  of
interest. I maintain that this has strengthened this Bill and  I  thank  the
committee. With those words, I wish to thank the Council. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of Constitution.

                      CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam  Chair
and colleagues, this Bill is a bit technical, so it may make for a bit of  a
dry delivery, but it is a very important piece of legislation.

The purpose of the amendment  is  to  introduce  a  sifting  mechanism  that
prevents the High Courts from being overburdened  by  unmeritorious  appeals
from the lower courts. The Bill attempts to achieve this by introducing  new
criteria for leave to appeal. In so doing, the Bill takes care to avoid  the
constitutional pitfalls  that  invalidated  the  previous  leave  to  appeal
procedure. The Constitutional Court pronounced on this matter  in  the  case
of Steyn v the State.

The 21 November  ruling  by  the  Constitutional  Court  declared  that  the
provisions of sections 309B and 309C of the Criminal Procedure  Act  imposed
an unjustifiable limitation on a person's right to appeal.
Before turning to the provisions of the Bill,  I  would  like  to  emphasise
that the Constitutional Court did  not  exclude  the  possibility  that  the
legislature  could  enact  legislative  measures  that  fall  short  of  the
automatic right of appeal, but still satisfy the constitutional  requirement
of fairness and can be justified in terms of the Constitution.

Following the Constitutional Court judgment,  the  Minister  instructed  the
department to establish a monitoring mechanism to determine  the  impact  of
automatic right of appeal on the administration of  justice.  A  survey  was
instituted to collect data on a number of appeals against decisions  of  the
lower courts received by the Higher Courts for a 12-month period  from  June
2001 to May 2002. It became clear that the High Court would, in the  absence
of a filtering mechanism,  be  faced  with  an  ever-increasing  backlog  of
appeals.

In the Second Reading debate of this Bill  in  the  National  Assembly,  the
Minister pointed out that the interests of justice demand that the right  to
appeal should be  concluded  without  undue  delay  and  referred,  in  this
instance, to the old adage that "Justice delayed  is  justice  denied".  The
main problem lies in the fact that a large number of appeals coming  to  the
High Court are completely without merit, yet it is just as costly  and  just
as time-consuming to deal with such appeals as it is to  deal  with  appeals
that stand a reasonable chance of being upheld.

Turning to the provisions of the Bill, I would like to point  out  that  the
amendments contained in clause 1 deal with  the  special  relationship  that
exists between reviews in the ordinary course of  business,  commonly  known
as automatic reviews, and  appeals  procedures  as  regulated  in  terms  of
section 302 of the Act.

Section 302 provides that the provisions regulating an automatic review  are
suspended if an appeal is launched against  a  conviction  or  sentence  and
ceases to be applicable when judgment is  given  in  the  appeal.  Clause  1
amends section 302 of the Act  so  as  to  highlight  the  newly  introduced
distinction between the appeal  procedures  for  certain  children  and  all
other persons in respect of whom automatic reviews are  applicable.  I  must
emphasise  that  the  relevant  amendment  does  not  affect  the   existing
principle that an automatic review is  suspended  and  eventually  cancelled
once judgment on appeal is given.

Having regard to the provisions  of  clause  2,  it  should  be  noted  that
section 309 of the Act is amended to provide that any  person  convicted  of
any offence in a lower court who wishes to appeal against the conviction  or
sentence may apply for leave to appeal against such conviction or  sentence,
as contemplated in sections 309B and 309C of the Act. I told  you  this  was
very technical; very, very technical.

An important and innovative exception to this requirement is now  introduced
into the Act,  namely  that  a  child  who  is  sentenced  to  any  form  of
imprisonment that is not wholly  suspended  and  who  at  the  time  of  the
commission of the offence was below 14 years, or was between the ages of  14
and 16 years and was unrepresented at the time of conviction in  a  regional
court may note an appeal without having to apply for leave  to  appeal.  The
relevant provision is included in this Bill as a temporary  measure  pending
the enactment of the Child Justice Bill. This will ensure  that  it  becomes
law when the leave to appeal and petition procedures come into effect.

Since it is so closely related to the main objective of  the  Child  Justice
Bill, namely to establish a new criminal justice  system  for  children  who
come into conflict with the law, the provision will eventually form part  of
the Child Justice Bill. Paragraph (b)  of  clause  2  is  the  result  of  a
recommendation that appeals must generally be disposed  of  in  chambers  on
the written arguments of the parties. Section 309 is  therefore  amended  to
provide that appeals  must  be  disposed  of  in  chambers  on  the  written
arguments of parties, unless the relevant court is of the opinion  that  the
interests of justice require the submission of oral argument before court.

Clause 3 introduces a new mechanism for applications for leave to appeal  in
the magistrates' court as provided  for  in  section  309B,  and  introduces
petition procedures in the High Court regulated in terms of section 309C  in
respect of the decisions by the lower courts. As  far  as  leave  to  appeal
procedure is concerned, an application must be made by  an  accused  to  the
lower court in which he or she was convicted. I  have  already  pointed  out
the exception that certain children need not apply for leave to appeal.  The
importance of submitting records of  the  proceedings  in  the  magistrates'
courts whenever petitions for leave to appeal are  addressed  to  the  Judge
President was highlighted in the Steyn judgment.

With regard to the petition procedure contained in section 309C of the  Act,
the new  subsection  4  requires  that  transcribed  case  records  must  be
submitted in respect of all petitions  to  the  High  Courts  for  leave  to
appeal. This subsection further contains a proviso in terms of which a  copy
of the judgment, which includes the reasons  for  conviction  and  sentence,
will be sufficient. This applies only where a  legally  represented  accused
was tried in the regional court, or if  the  accused  and  the  Director  of
Public Prosecutions agree to this, or if the prospective appeal  is  against
sentence only, or if the petition  relates  solely  to  an  application  for
condonation.

Placing information before judges who must consider these  petitions  is  an
important aspect of the procedure as the judicial officers must be  able  to
make informed decisions. The responsibility to determine whether  sufficient
information has been placed before them ultimately rests with  those  judges
who consider petitions. If insufficient information has been  placed  before
them, they may call for additional information.  The  amendment  to  section
309D of the Act aims to further  regulate  the  obligation  to  explain  the
rights  of  an  unrepresented  accused   in   respect   of   appeal,   legal
representation and the correct procedure to give effect to these rights.

The amendment of section 315 is similar to that in respect  of  section  309
and provides that appeals must, as a rule, be disposed  of  in  chambers  on
the written arguments of the parties. Section 316 of the Act  regulates  the
leave to appeal and petition procedures  in  the  High  Courts  and  Supreme
Court of Appeal and is amended by clause 5 so as to align it  with  the  new
procedures contemplated in the lower courts.

I commend the select committee under  the  leadership  of  its  chairperson,
Kgoshi Mokoena, for the efforts they have  put  into  considering  this  new
legislation. The departmental  officials  who  worked  on  this  legislation
should also be acknowledged. I stand in support of this Bill. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, thank you very  much,  and  thanks  to  you
too, Deputy Minister, for really breaking the ice.

In the late eighties, three MK cadres were given life  imprisonment  because
it was believed they had committed some murders. They lodged an appeal  but,
unfortunately, the leave of appeal was refused. They rotted in jail for  not
less than eight years. I'm talking about the Eikenhof Three.

Everybody was convinced  that  they  were  responsible  for  those  murders,
except for us in the ANC, because we  knew  that  they  were  innocent.  The
three consistently maintained their innocence and declared  that  they  were
wrongly accused. However, the powers that held sway then  did  not  want  to
listen.

After some years, we were so relieved when Apla  members  came  forward  and
revealed that they were responsible for those  murders.  It  was  only  then
that the Eikenhof Three were released. Just imagine the trauma of  being  in
prison for something you did not do. This miscarriage of justice took  place
because some judges, then, believed they were a law unto themselves.

Let's assume these proposed amendments were part of  the  Act  then.  It  is
obvious that this mess  wouldn't  have  happened,  and  it  is,  apparently,
categorically and abundantly clear that the Eikenhof Three  would  then  not
have suffered that terrible humiliation.

That is the  reason  why,  amongst  other  reasons,  the  Minister  and  his
department felt that in this new  dispensation,  the  judiciary  had  to  be
consistent with the Constitution, and that a person's right  to  appeal  had
to be respected. Hence this Bill before the  Council  is  dealing  with  the
leave-to-appeal and the petition procedures.

Members will recall that, before 1994, people who wanted to lodge an  appeal
had to have a certificate to appeal. However, in the  interim  Constitution,
it was allowed that any person who was found guilty had an  automatic  right
to  appeal.  After  a  while,  it  was  discovered  or  realised  that  this
arrangement had created some problems for higher courts.

High  Courts  were  flooded  with  numerous  appeals  from   lower   courts.
Statistics show that it will take no less than five years for  some  appeals
to be heard or finalised by the High Courts. It was,  therefore,  imperative
that  something  was  done.  The  Bill  is  now  introducing  some   sifting
mechanisms that will prevent the  High  Court  from  being  overburdened  by
unmeritorious appeals.

The ANC-led Government  will  always  respect  our  courts,  especially  the
Constitutional Court. The Steyn versus the State case, as pronounced by  the
Constitutional Court, is a typical example. Many  of  these  amendments  are
triggered by that particular pronouncement by the Constitutional Court.

I deliberately did not  dwell  much  on  the  leave-to-appeal  process,  the
condonation and the notice. I did not even tell or inform this  House  about
how children are going to benefit from these amendments. Again,  I  did  not
touch on the question  of  prisoners  in  this  Bill.  I  can  promise  you,
colleagues, that the hon Joyce Kgoali will give you "Umrabulo 19",  and  the
hon members Matthee and Lever will do the right thing by telling  you  about
the rules of engagement.

Before concluding, let me just, in passing, deal  with  one  issue  in  this
Bill. In the past, when one lodged an appeal,  the  whole  transcribed  case
record was supposed to be submitted. This amendment now  makes  it  possible
that only the judgment need be submitted to the relevant  High  Court  where
the appeal is to be heard. This arrangement will apply to persons  who  were
legally represented.

Small people monopolise the talking, while  calculated  and  focused  people
monopolise the listening. Since I belong to the latter category, let me  sit
down and listen. Let's support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, hierdie wetsontwerp beoog om gelyke  beskerming
van die reg  aan  alle  persone  te  gee  en  om  toegang  tot  die  reg  te
vergemaklik. Dit is opgestel, soos reeds aangetoon,  as  'n  direkte  gevolg
van die Konstitusionele Hof se uitspraak in die  saak  van  Steyn  teen  die
staat.  In  hierdie  saak  moes  die  Konstitusionele  Hof  beslis  oor  die
konstitusionaliteit van die appèlprosedures vanaf die  laer  howe.  Dit  het
die appèlprosedures in die laer howe oorweeg teenoor die appèlproses in  die
Hoë Hof en tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat die situasie vir 'n  beskuldigde
persoon wat teen  'n  landdros  se  uitspraak  wil  appelleer,  baie  minder
gunstig is as dié van 'n persoon wat teen sy skuldigbevinding of  vonnis  in
'n Hoë Hof appelleer.

Die Konstitusionele Hof het gevolglik besluit dat artikels 309(b) en  309(c)
van die Strafproseswet nie voldoen aan die bepalings van artikel  35(3)  van
die Grondwet, wat aan elke beskuldigde persoon die  reg  tot  'n  regverdige
verhoor waarborg, welke reg die reg van appèl na of hersiening deur  'n  Hoë
Hof insluit. Die Konstitusionele Hof het gevolglik die vermelde artikel  van
die  Strafproseswet  ongeldig  verklaar.  Hierdie   wetsontwerp   maak   nou
voorsiening  vir  toestemming  tot  appèl  en   petisieprosedures   in   die
Strafproseswet. Dit beoog  om  te  verhoed  dat  die  Hoë  Howe  oorlaai  of
toegegooi word met appèlle  vanaf  die  laer  howe,  waar  sodanige  appèlle
sonder meriete is. Dit maak ook  daarvoor  voorsiening  dat  sekere  appèlle
oorweeg en beslis mag word, op grond van die skriftelike argumente of  betoë
van die partye.

Dié  wetsontwerp  voorsien  ook  'n  outomatiese  reg  van  appèl  aan  drie
kategorieë persone, naamlik persone wat ten tye  van  die  pleging  van  die
misdaad onder die ouderdom van 14 was; persone wat ten tyde van die  pleging
van die misdaad tussen die ouderdomme van 14 en 16 jaar oud was en  wat  nie
deur 'n regsverteenwoordiger bygestaan is by die  verhoor  nie  en  derdens,
persone wat gevonnis is tot enige  vorm  van  gevangenisstraf  wat  nie  ten
volle opgeskort is nie. Voorsitter, in ag genome  dat  die  Regterspresident
en die hooflanddroste en die streekhofpresidente  almal  geraadpleeg  is  by
die opstel van hierdie wetsontwerp, glo ons en  vertrou  ons  dat  die  nuwe
bepalings nou die grondwetlikheidstoets sal slaag. Ons glo ook  dat  hierdie
wetsontwerp weer eens die belangrikheid van die reg van elke persoon tot  'n
regverdige verhoor onder alle omstandighede beklemtoon en daarom  ondersteun
ons hierdie wetsontwerp met entoesiasme.

Ter afsluiting wil ek egter net, soos  in  regstaal  gesê  word,  'n  obiter
dictum-opmerking maak en dit is dat ek die departement wil  vra  om,  terwyl
ons aandag  gee  aan  wat  reg  is  in  terme  van  die  Grondwet,  aan  die
belangrikheid van die regverdige verhoor ten  opsigte  van  die  beskuldigde
aandag te skenk. Maar ek dink dit het ook tyd geword dat ons ook aandag  gee
en dink aan 'n regverdige verhoor vanuit die hoek  van  die  slagoffers  van
misdaad.  Ons  onskuldige  vroue  en  kinders,  en  ook   ander   onskuldige
slagoffers van misdaad, dat daar ook uit hulle hoek  'n  regverdige  verhoor
sal wees, wat ook hulle regte regverdiglik benadruk, sodat  daar  behoorlike
vervolgings sal plaasvind op 'n regverdige  basis.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, this  Bill  envisages  providing  all  persons
with equal protection of the law and to facilitate access  to  the  law.  It
was drafted, as already indicated, as a direct result of the  Constitutional
Court's finding in the case  of  Steyn  vs  the  State.  In  this  case  the
Constitutional Court had  to  decide  about  the  constitutionality  of  the
appeal  procedures  from  the  lower  courts.  It  weighed  up  the   appeal
procedures of the lower courts against the appeal process in the High  Court
and arrived at the conclusion that the situation in the case of  an  accused
person wanting to appeal against a  magistrate's  statement,  is  much  less
favourable than that of a person wanting to appeal  against  his  conviction
or sentence in a High Court.

The Constitutional Court therefore decided that sections 309B  and  309C  of
the Criminal Procedure Act do not comply  with  the  provisions  of  section
35(3) of the Constitution, that guarantees every accused  person  the  right
to a fair trial,  which  right  includes  the  right  to  appeal  after,  or
revision by, a High Court. Consequently the  Constitutional  Court  declared
the aforementioned section of the Criminal Procedure Act invalid. This  Bill
now makes provision for consent to appeal and  petition  procedures  in  the
Criminal Procedure Act. It  envisages  preventing  High  Courts  from  being
overloaded with or inundated by appeals from the lower  courts,  where  such
appeals are without merit. It  also  makes  provision  for  certain  appeals
being considered and  settled,  on  the  grounds  of  written  arguments  or
objections by the parties.

This Bill also makes provision for an automatic right  to  appeal  by  three
categories of persons, namely persons who, at the time when  the  crime  was
committed, were under the age of 14; persons who at the time when the  crime
was committed were between the ages of 14 and 16 and who were  not  assisted
by a legal representative during the trial and, thirdly,  persons  who  were
sentenced to  any  form  of  imprisonment  that  was  not  fully  suspended.
Chairperson, taking into account that  the  Judge-President  and  the  chief
magistrates and the regional court presidents  were  all  consulted  in  the
drafting of this Bill, we trust and believe that  the  new  provisions  will
now pass the constitutionality test. We also believe  that  this  Bill  will
once again emphasise the importance of every person's right to a fair  trial
under all circumstances and for  this  reason  we  enthusiastically  support
this Bill.

In conclusion, I would just, as it is said in  legal  terminology,  like  to
make an obiter dictum remark and that is  that  I  would  like  to  ask  the
department, while we are devoting attention to what is  right  in  terms  of
the Constitution, to do so with regard to the importance of the  fair  trial
with regard to the accused. But I think it is time for us to  pay  attention
and think about a fair trial from the perspective of the victims  of  crime.
Our innocent women and children, and other innocent victims of  crime,  that
there should also be a fair trial in their view, that would  also  emphasise
their rights fairly, so that proper prosecutions will take place on  a  just
basis. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I just want to find out if  it  is  parliamentary
for hon Durr to answer his phone in the House, whilst the plenary is on.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think that it  was  not  by  design,
and he has taken care of that.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, again I am speaking  fourth  in  the  debate  and
again the Deputy Minister has given a comprehensive analysis of the Bill.

My agb vriend mnr Matthee het dieselfde gedoen in Afrikaans. Ek is  nie  nog
'n landstaal magtig om dieselfde te doen nie. [My hon friend Mr Matthee  did
the same in Afrikaans. I do not know another official  language  so  that  I
could do the same.]

I will attempt to give just a brief  overview  of  the  whole  Bill  without
giving  details  specifically.  The  Criminal   Procedure   Amendment   Bill
reintroduces a filter or sifting mechanism for  criminal  appeals  from  the
magistrates' courts to the High Courts. The only persons who will  not  have
to apply for leave to appeal in certain  circumstances  are  children  below
the age of 14 years and children between the age of  14  and  16  years  who
were not represented by a legal practitioner  during  the  course  of  their
crime.

Currently, as a result of the Constitutional Court ruling  in  the  case  of
Steyn vs the State, all persons who have been convicted in the  magistrates'
courts have an automatic right  to  appeal  to  the  High  Court.  This  has
resulted in the High Courts being overburdened with  cases  whose  prospects
of succeeding on appeal are bleak.

Consequently, the  provisions  of  sections  309(b)  and  309(c)  have  been
redrafted in a manner that addresses  the  concerns  of  the  Constitutional
Court. The Bill will drastically reduce the  number  of  frivolous  criminal
appeals. It will allow the High Courts to deal with criminal appeals,  where
there  may  have  been  a  serious  miscarriage  of  justice,  speedily  and
efficiently.

It is, therefore, in the interest of justice that  we  should  support  this
Bill. The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Deputy Chairperson, Deputy  Minister  and
hon members of the Council, today  the  Select  Committee  on  Security  and
Constitutional  Affairs  is  proud  to  have  been  able   to   successfully
deliberate on this piece of legislation, though it took much longer  for  it
to be referred to this august House. I am proud to say that members  of  the
select committee considered this Bill with earnest  dedication  and  applied
their minds meticulously.

Allow me to remind hon members of the background to this Bill.  It  will  be
important for all of us to remember  that  before  1994  all  persons  found
guilty of crime in the magistrates' courts had an automatic right to  appeal
to the  High  Court,  whether  they  were  represented  or  not.  After  the
introduction of the interim Constitution, in 1996, the Constitutional  Court
considered the implications and constitutionality of this  appeal  procedure
and found it to be unconstitutional.

The Constitutional Court felt that  the  leave-to-appeal  procedure  in  the
magistrates' courts was flawed, because the Act did not make  it  obligatory
for magistrates who turned down the leave to appeal to  furnish  the  judges
of the High Court with a full record of what transpired in the  magistrates'
court. Thus the Constitutional Court declared the relevant sections of  this
Act unconstitutional. The  court  acknowledged  that  there  might  be  good
reasons to remove the automatic right to appeal, but held that  no  evidence
was presented to it that would justify its removal.

The Constitutional Court then granted  Parliament  a  period  of  12  months
within which to introduce a  mechanism  to  enable  magistrates'  courts  to
process those appeals, but, unfortunately, Parliament was unable  to  do  so
within the stipulated time.  As  a  result,  a  provision  in  the  Criminal
Procedure Act  relating  to  the  exception  lapsed,  and  convicts  had  an
automatic right to appeal. This resulted in many appeals not being  properly
processed and thereby created a problem  for  the  High  Courts,  given  the
volumes of paperwork that they had to deal with.  It  is  therefore  against
this background that the select committee considered these amendments.

In  addressing  these  issues  raised  by  the  Constitutional  Court,   the
committee applied its mind. This we did with a clear understanding that  the
Constitution is the supreme law of the Republic  of  South  Africa.  It  was
therefore necessary that we amended this piece of legislation.

Therefore  this  Bill  introduces  the  leave-to-appeal  procedure  in   the
magistrates' courts and provides access for the judges of  the  High  Courts
to the full records of the proceedings of  all  cases  of  the  magistrates'
courts. What is also important  to  note  is  that  this  Bill  provides  an
automatic right to appeal to certain persons, namely children under the  age
of 14 years and children older than 14  but  less  than  16  years  who  are
without legal representation at the trial and were convicted in  a  regional
court.

It is important to note, which is the last point that I want  to  raise,  in
clause 8 of this Bill, the short title,  "commencement  of  the  Bill".  The
clause stipulates 1 November 2003 or any earlier date, as the President  may
determine, as the date of commencement. That clause is  a  problem  to  this
committee. We therefore thought that it was necessary for the  President  to
be given enough time to  consider  and  determine  the  date  after  he  has
considered the Bill  and  satisfied  himself,  in  order  to  avoid  further
Constitutional Court cases. The date of 1 November should  be  removed  from
the Bill. And,  we  thought  that  the  hon  President  needs  to  be  given
sufficient time to consider the piece of legislation and then sign it to  be
an Act of Parliament.

The ANC supports this Bill with its amendments, and we have  no  doubt  that
our colleagues in the  National  Assembly  will  find  this  amendment  very
necessary and important. Hence, we feel as this small  House  that  we  have
applied our minds and given  thought  to  all  the  issues  that  have  been
raised, whereas they sat with the Bill from 2002 and only gave it to  us  in
2003. But, in two days we were  able  as  this  committee,  because  of  our
commitment, to raise these issues. Thank you very much, Chair. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Members  of
the committee and hon members of this Council, thank you very much for  your
well-considered inputs.

I would like to say to Mr Lever that his being fourth might  be  a  problem,
but my being last and having to provide sum-ups of  sum-ups,  which  becomes
very complicated, is more of a problem. We also do not  want  to  bore  this
honourable Council and the members of the public, so I will be  brief.  I'll
tackle just a couple of issues, perhaps.

Chairperson, thank you for bringing to our attention a practical  case  such
as that of the "Eikenhof Three", which shows how this  new  mechanism  would
work. For those of us who aren't lawyers, which includes  myself,  it  gives
us a real-life situation that makes sense and makes us see the law  live  in
our midst, and I think that is always very helpful. Lawyers have a  tendency
towards legalese and sometimes can mystify very  ordinary  things  with  big
terms and big words, and this was  a  very  practical  illustration  of  how
effective things could be with this new legislation.

On the issue raised by Mr Matthee regarding  a  victim-centred  approach  to
law and our approach to courts, I must just say that given the  human-rights
approach of our legislation, this is the assumed position of our courts  and
of our current legislation.

I also think that as leaders  across  political  parties,  we  have  a  very
important task to do in  eliminating  from  the  minds  of  the  public  the
unjustifiable perception - I know that as a legal  person  you  would  agree
with me on this - that the accused  enjoy  more  rights  than  the  defence.
There is this urban myth going around, and we need to explain to the  people
how the law works so that they are  satisfied  that  the  accused  get  good
representation that protects their interests.

In view of our history, where a justice system was  used  for  unjust  acts,
particularly as they related to  the  accused  in  political  cases  and  on
summary  charges,  we  have  a  special  history  to  honour  in  terms   of
recognising that the accused, and even those found guilty, are  entitled  to
certain human rights. We acknowledge that by committing certain  things  and
being found guilty thereof, they relinquish  certain  rights  too.  But,  we
have  to  inculcate  in  our  national  community  an  empathy  and  a  real
treasuring of our constitutional dispensation, and I would appeal to you  to
take this message out.

On the other hand, to address your concerns around  victims  -  and  we  are
very aware that courts, in a normal course of business, can very often  lead
to a secondary victimisation  process  unless  magistrates  and  prosecutors
have been sensitised to those issues.

The Law Reform Commission has considered this matter and concluded  it  this
past  Saturday.  The  report  will  be  submitted  to   the   Minister   for
consideration and possible implementation, and I'm sure that  that  will  be
in the next Parliament because it is a very, very, very detailed  aspect  of
how our courts operate, how the victim is somehow  brought  into  a  process
and issues such as impact statements for victims which have been  used  very
successfully in other courts in other dispensations.

So I want to put a positive spin on it. Let's just say that you and I  stand
together and say to the community at large: We demand of our  legislation  a
human-rights approach. We affirm that approach and we  automatically  affirm
the rights of victims to a specialist approach  in  their  predicament,  and
then educate people about how the law tries to achieve this.

With reference to my hon colleague Kgoali, I take  note  of  what  she  said
about the effective date. I just need to reassure you that the President  in
this regard is very wily to the facts of what  is  happening  and  where  in
Parliament, and this is precisely  the  reason  that  he  has  parliamentary
councillors who monitor processes and maybe flagged issues that  might  come
up that would require him to apply his mind within  a  given  timeframe.  So
we, as this Parliament and the President, have set in place structures  that
will say, "Gosh! There's some really urgent stuff coming".

This new legislation strikes  a  balance  between  the  aspirations  of  our
Constitution and the appropriate administration of justice, and  that  is  a
high-wire act. And, of course, we always - it's a bit like  in  the  army  -
work on stuff for two years and it is like, "Hurry up and  wait".  You  want
to get it through yesterday.  That  is  the  nature  of  our  process.  It's
consultative;  it's  faultful,  and  then  when  we   realise   we've   been
consultative and thoughtful, the element of urgency always creeps in at  the
end.

I think that, obviously in this year, these issues are  exacerbated  as  the
elections draw to a real final close.  We've  got  no  extension  dates  and
things like that. We've got a lot of work to do before  those  elections.  I
think this is the added pressure.

I will, however, raise the issue that you have raised  with  the  councillor
to the President, the parliamentary councillor, and I'm sure she will  alert
him to the legislation coming his  way  for  approval  and  highlight  those
specific aspects that you have all raised. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
   AFFAIRS ON TREATY BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AND THE PEOPLE'S
      REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN CRIMINAL MATTERS

Mr P A  MATTHEE:  Chairperson,  the  Mutual  Legal  Assistance  in  Criminal
Matters Treaty between  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  the  People's
Republic of China, which was signed by the Minister for Justice at  Pretoria
on 20 January 2003, is a standard treaty of mutual legal  assistance.  South
Africa has similar treaties with many other states.

The People's Republic of  China,  with  its  large  population,  is  a  very
important country for South Africa, and the  Select  Committee  on  Security
and Constitutional Affairs is glad that this agreement has now been  entered
into in  terms  of  section  27(1)  of  the  International  Co-operation  in
Criminal Matters Act, Act 75 of 1996.

Chair, this treaty will, no doubt, improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  law
enforcement  authorities   of   both   countries   in   the   investigation,
prosecution, and prevention of crime through co-operation and  mutual  legal
assistance in criminal matters. It  should,  therefore,  be  supported  with
enthusiasm by all law-abiding South Africans.

In terms  of  article  24(1)  of  the  treaty,  the  treaty  is  subject  to
ratification and the instruments of ratification shall  be  exchanged  at  a
place to be agreed upon.

As it is therefore necessary for us to ratify this treaty, I, on  behalf  of
the committee, call upon this Council to ratify this treaty  unanimously.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. That concludes the  debate.
I shall now put the question, that the report be adopted. This  decision  is
dealt with in terms of  section  65  of  the  Constitution.  I  shall  first
ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the  Chamber  to  cast
their provinces' votes. I think they are all present.

In accordance with Rule 72 I shall first allow provinces the opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. There is  none.  We  shall
now proceed to voting on the question.  I  shall  do  this  in  alphabetical
order, per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to  the  Chair
whether they vote in favour, against, or abstain from voting.

Ms B N DLULANE: In favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

Constitution.

 CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON SECURITY AND CONSTITUTIONAL
  AFFAIRS ON NOTICE IN TERMS OF INTERIM RATIONALISATION OF JURISDICTION OF
                               HIGH COURTS ACT

Mr L G LEVER: Thank you, Chairperson. By way of  background  to  the  notice
issued by the hon Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development,  the
Interim Rationalisation of Jurisdiction of High Courts  Act  seeks  to  give
effect  to  the  requirements  of  Item  16(6)(a)  of  Schedule  6  of   the
Constitution.

Prior to 1994 we had a number of nominally  independent  states,  each  with
its own High Courts and  departments  of  justice.  A  number  of  anomalies
arose: Many people were often forced to travel many miles to have access  to
justice, when there were more convenient options readily available to  them.
The Interim Rationalisation of Jurisdiction of  High  Courts  Act  seeks  to
redress this problem.

The Interim Rationalisation Act seeks to promote access to  justice,  proper
utilisation of resources, and  promotes  the  constitutional  imperative  of
access to justice.

The hon Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development  has  consulted
with the effective role-players, the  Chief  Justice  has  mediated  between
affected parties and consensus has been reached on the changes to  areas  of
jurisdiction proposed in the hon Minister's notice.

The Natal and Durban and Coast local divisions will be given  the  areas  of
Umzimkhulu, Matatiele and Maluti, which will be given  up  by  the  Transkei
division; the  Eastern  Cape  division  will  gain  areas  of  Herschel  and
Sterkspruit, which will be given up by the  Transkei  division;  the  Ciskei
division will gain  Cathcart,  East  London,  King  William's  Town,  Komga,
Queestown and Stutterheim; the Transkei division  will  gain  Barkley  East,
Elliot, Indwe, Maclear and Ugie.

In terms of the Interim Rationalisation Act both Houses of  Parliament  must
approve the notice before it can be published  in  the  Government  Gazette.
The select committee recommends that this House approve this  notice  as  it
makes access  to  justice  easier  for  the  majority  of  ordinary  people.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. That concludes the  debate.
Again I shall put the question, that the report be adopted. As the  decision
is dealt with in terms of section 65 of  the  Constitution,  I  shall  first
ascertain whether delegation heads are present in the Chamber to cast  their
votes. It looks as if they are all present. In accordance  with  Rule  72  I
shall first allow provinces the opportunity to make  declarations  of  vote,
if they so wish. There is none.

We shall  now  proceed  to  voting  on  the  question.  I  shall  do  so  in
alphabetical order. Delegation heads  must  please  indicate  to  the  Chair
whether they vote in favour, against or abstain from voting.

Eastern Cape?

BUSINESS SUSPENDED AT 11:50 AND RESUMED AT 14:10.

                          PETROLEUM PIPELINES BILL

                                 (Statement)

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, I was  not  expecting  this.  Hon  members,  the
significance of this Bill lies in the strategic importance of  the  pipeline
network to the economy of a country, as the economy depends  on  the  stable
supply of fuel  products  which  are  transported  through  the  network  of
pipelines. It is in this context that in the art of  both  conventional  and
guerrilla military warfare, attack and  dislocation  of  petroleum  pipeline
networks have assumed strategic supremacy. I think hon Tolo will agree  with
me as a former guerrilla in this respect.

So let us imagine a  situation  in  which  the  supply  of  liquid  fuel  is
disrupted in our country; it would bring  everything  and  every  aspect  of
life to a virtual standstill. There would be no transport for people  to  go
to work, to shopping centres, schools and other  social  centres,  including
places of worship. Goods would not  be  transported  into  and  out  of  the
country. The country would be isolated from itself and the whole world.

For quite a while, the operation and management of commercial  pipelines  in
South Africa have been in the hands of  the  state.  This  Bill  before  the
House this afternoon represents  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  operation  and
management of petroleum pipelines by opening the  industry  to  the  private
sector. In doing  so,  the  Bill  introduces  a  new  regime  of  regulatory
measures to ensure the efficient  operation  of  the  pipeline  network  and
orderly development of the network in future.

In view of the vision of the ANC, of creating and building  a  developmental
state, it would be unwise to leave total operation of  the  network  to  the
market forces without state intervention.  Therefore  the  main  purpose  of
this Bill is to establish a petroleum pipeline regulator as a custodian  and
enforcer of the national regulatory framework. One of the key  functions  of
the regulator will be the issuing of licences and  setting  of  tariffs  and
national standards for global economic competitiveness and local growth.

Through setting  of  tariffs  and  charges,  the  Bill  promotes  access  to
affordable petroleum products, thus bringing to  an  end  excessive  charges
owing to monopolistic control and ownership of pipeline networks. It  is  in
the nature of monopoly to determine prices unilaterally and usually  charges
higher prices, owing  to  lack  of  competing  service  providers.  In  this
regard, this Bill will bring to an end anticompetitive  practices  that  are
so rampant in the unregulated monopolistic capitalist markets.

Through licensing, entry by companies owned and controlled  by  historically
disadvantaged groups will be promoted and encouraged in  the  mainstream  of
the industry. In the issuing of licenses, the  regulator  will  ensure  that
big companies that apply for licenses have to show their commitment  to  the
empowerment of the historically disadvantaged groups. Entry by  historically
disadvantaged sections of our communities is not limited  to  the  petroleum
pipelines, but also stretches to the whole supply chain of the industry.

Through this, the ANC-led Government is translating into  a  living  reality
the vision of the Freedom Charter, crafted 57 years back by the pioneers  of
our struggle in Kliptown, who charged that, and I quote: "The  people  shall
share in the country's wealth."

The Bill also take cognisance of the  accidents  and  health  hazards  these
pipelines pose to the communities living around them. And  in  this  regard,
it makes it compulsory for applicants to comply with  health,  security  and
environment conditions as one of the conditions to get a  licence.  It  also
compels licencees to submit an emergency plan to the authority on an  annual
basis in the event of system failures, accidents and other emergencies.

Companies  are  compelled  to  train  their  employees  in  terms   of   the
implementation of the emergency plan and let the community know  about  this
place. The Bill places local government, as the sphere of government  closer
to the people, at the centre of decision-making in terms of  the  plans  for
petroleum pipelines.

In conclusion, the Bill regulates the pipeline network in order to create  a
stable and internationally competitive liquid fuel industry in our  country.
For this reason, I challenge this august House to join the  ANC  in  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty by supporting  this  Bill  unconditionally.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                      PETROLEUM PRODUCTS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, hon members,  presented  to  this  august  House
this afternoon, a few months from celebrating the  dawn  of  the  decade  of
freedom, is the Petroleum Products  Amendment  Bill,  which  represents  yet
another  critical  milestone  in  the  growing   task   to   transform   the
socioeconomic relations in our country. The  Bill  seeks  to  modernise  the
Petroleum Products Act of 1977, in line with the current  socioeconomic  and
political realities of the South African  liquid  fuel  industry.  In  doing
this, it will ensure that governance of the liquid fuel sector  is  in  line
with the new Government policy imperatives, by giving effect  to  the  White
Paper on Energy for regulation of the industry.
At the present moment, South Africa's  petroleum  industry  is  beset  by  a
myriad problems and constraints that have the potential to throw the  entire
industry into the throes of disruption if not attended to with  a  sense  of
urgency and purpose. Allow me to cite some of the key problems  facing  this
industry, which this Bill seeks to address.

The agreement between Sasol and other oil companies is  coming  to  an  end,
resulting in uncertainties and new negotiations that pose a  threat  to  the
stable and continued supply of quality products nationwide.

The recent mass closure  of  rural  service  stations  and  the  concomitant
proliferation of service stations in  urban  areas  have  the  potential  to
create a shortage of supply in the  rural  areas,  thus  putting  the  whole
network of supply at risk owing to economically unsound investments  in  the
urban areas. Since the retail margins are small,  it  therefore  means  that
more service stations mean lesser margins, thus impacting on  petrol  prices
for motorists. The situation will  deteriorate  if  Sasol  and  PetroSA  are
allowed to enter into retailing, which will have  a  regrettable  impact  on
the small and medium-sized service stations.

Surely,  no  responsible  Government  would  allow  this  situation  to   go
unattended. Hence, at the core, the objective of this  Bill  is  to  address
such challenges. The Bill seeks to provide for  licensing  of  manufacturing
and selling of petroleum  products  to  ensure  control  in  the  number  of
service stations allowed to operate.  By  limiting  the  number  of  service
stations according to demand and consumption of petroleum products, it  will
ensure efficient and productive retailing service stations.  If  the  number
of service stations is not limited,  the  volume  of  sales  per  site  will
decrease and cause increase in the retail  margin  and  the  overall  petrol
price.

Those wholesalers who want to enter the overtraded retail  market,  such  as
PetroSA and Sasol, could  trade  obligations  to  retailers  to  reduce  the
pressure to increase the number of sites. As  we  move  closer  towards  the
dawn of the decade of freedom, we do so with a  great  sense  of  pride  and
duty  that  our  Government,  through  this  Bill,  also  seeks  to  promote
transformation and black economic empowerment in the liquid fuel industry.

The Bill  promotes  the  advancement  of  historically  disadvantaged  South
Africans through  licensing.  It  also  gives  effect  to  the  liquid  fuel
charter,  through  the  envisaged  regulations  that  will  be   promulgated
subsequent to the passage of this Bill.  Of  critical  significance  to  the
poorest of the poor in this country is the fact that  this  Bill  recognises
the importance of paraffin and the LPG as the main  sources  of  energy  for
the poor, by ensuring that the prices of paraffin and LPG are affordable  to
the poorest of the poor.

Through prohibition of self-services at  petrol  service  stations  in  this
Bill, the ANC-led Government is up to the task  of  promoting  the  creation
and preservation of jobs. The Bill also prohibits the direct  entry  of  all
companies into the fuel retailing  sector,  thus  saving  small  and  medium
companies, which may close in the  face  of  unfair  competitions  from  big
companies. This could just as well lead to serious job losses.

With the passage of this Bill this afternoon, we  are  breaking  ranks  with
the culture of the past in terms of which oil  companies  would  simply  use
products that are harmful, without due regard to the health  of  our  people
and the impact on the environment. This Bill gives the  Minister  the  power
to  put  in  place  regulations  that  will  prescribe  specifications   and
standards, and to prohibit the blending or mixing of petroleum  products  in
pursuit of profit at the expense of our people's health.

With this short presentation, I present this Bill before  you  for  adoption
without amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        ELECTORAL LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Hon Chairperson, hon members of the  NCOP,  on
26 September 2003 I introduced the Electoral  Laws  Amendment  Bill  in  the
National Assembly. After  vigorously  debating  it,  the  National  Assembly
subsequently adopted the Bill.

Today I feel honoured to introduce this very important piece of  legislation
before this House. It is important, because it is the basis upon which  next
year's elections are, in fact, going to be conducted. At  the  moment  there
are no legal mechanisms governing the electoral system to be used for  these
elections.

You will recall that the 1999 elections  were  conducted  in  terms  of  the
transitional arrangements set out in Schedule 6  of  our  Constitution,  the
Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act  108  of  1996.  In  fact,
section 46 of the Constitution requires Parliament to pass an Act  in  terms
of which an electoral system can in fact be determined.

In an attempt  to  find  the  most  appropriate  electoral  system  for  our
country, I appointed the Electoral Task Team, under the chairmanship  of  Dr
Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, in 2002. The Electoral Task Team's brief was  to
investigate an electoral system that is best suited to  our  needs,  and  to
formulate the parameters of new electoral legislation in  order  to  prepare
for the scheduled national and provincial elections in 2004 and beyond.

This team completed its investigation towards the end of 2002 and  submitted
its report in January 2003. The report contained two  different  conclusions
on the appropriate electoral system  for  both  the  National  Assembly  and
provincial legislatures.

I then submitted the report to Cabinet for a decision. Cabinet decided  that
electoral  legislation  should  be  drafted  in  line  with   the   minority
recommendation, and not  in  line  with  the  majority  recommendation.  The
proposed electoral system for 2004 is incorporated  in  the  Electoral  Laws
Amendment Bill, which I now have the pleasure of presenting to this House.

Besides accommodating the electoral system, the Bill  also  seeks  to  amend
certain provisions that have now become obsolete in both the  Electoral  Act
of 1998 and the Electoral Commission Act  of  1996.  The  enactment  of  the
Local Government: Municipal Electoral Act of 2000 provided for an  electoral
system for municipalities, so that the Electoral Act of 1998 now applies  to
municipal elections  only  to  the  extent  as  set  out  in  the  Municipal
Electoral Act.

The Bill also seeks to introduce  a  measure  in  terms  of  which  disabled
voters could be assisted, as well as provisions dealing with  mobile  voting
stations, especially in our rural areas. However, it does  not  provide  for
South Africans to vote abroad.

The schedule containing the  proposed  electoral  system  for  the  National
Assembly and  the  provincial  legislatures  seeks  to  retain  the  current
electoral system.  The  system  provides  for  400  seats  in  the  National
Assembly to be filled in an election where voters  vote  for  a  party.  The
party is allocated a number of seats proportional to the percentage  of  the
total number of votes attracted by  the  particular  party.  The  seats  are
filled from nine regional lists of  candidates,  topped  up,  if  necessary,
from the national list of candidates.

The  proposed  amending  Bill  also  retains  the  current  system  to   the
provincial legislatures and further regulates the modalities  of  conducting
elections and allocating seats  in  the  National  Assembly  and  provincial
legislatures. I regret the fact that there has been this  delay.  I  am  not
responsible for it. In fact, I have got to abide by what  Cabinet  says.  Of
course, we are jointly and severally responsible as Cabinet.  But  in  spite
of that, I would like to say that all of you are aware that I am a  Minister
of a minority party operating in Government.
I urge that this House accept the Electoral Laws  Amendment  Bill.  I  thank
you, Sir. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you,  hon
Minister. Hon members, I have been informed that copies  of  the  report  of
the Select Committee on Social Services have been distributed in the  House.
I think everyone has got a copy. As we deliberate on the Bill, bear in  mind
that you have the report and that it has been agreed to by the committee.

Ms L JACOBUS: Deputy Chair, I thought I was going to be  much  briefer  than
the Minister, but it  seems  he  has  already  gotten  there.  I  think  the
Minister has set the pace for this debate. May I also just indicate,  before
I get to my speech, that with regard to the next debate on the next  Bill  -
a Home Affairs Bill - I have asked my colleague hon member  Kgware  to  lead
the debate on my behalf and to present my input. I wanted to  indicate  that
to the Duty Whip, but unfortunately he is not here  -  if  the  Table  could
just take note of that because I have to leave.
Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and members, it is again my pleasure  to  rise
to participate in the debate on behalf of the  Select  Committee  on  Social
Services on the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill.

As we are aware, this Bill was passed in the  National  Assembly  before  we
adjourned for the constituency period we are currently supposed  to  be  in.
This is the second time we  are  interrupting  the  constituency  period  to
reconvene to pass this and other pieces of legislation.  We  had  a  sitting
this morning as  well  at  which  we  passed  other  pieces  of  legislation
concerning justice.

The point I'm trying to make is that of the  continually  late  and  hurried
introduction of legislation by our executive as a whole. I'm not pointing  a
finger at the Minister in particular.  As  I  said,  this  is  an  executive
problem. This places a tremendous strain and pressure on committees to  pass
legislation and, many a time, to overlook important  detail  that  may  have
unintended negative consequences.

This then casts all sorts of negative aspersions on ourselves as members  of
Parliament. It also brings into question our integrity and  our  ability  to
do what we were elected to do, and that is to represent and speak on  behalf
of all our people and to  debate  their  views  and  concerns.  This  urgent
meeting we have to have in order to rescind an amendment  we  proposed  when
we deliberated and voted on the Bill proves what I have just said.

We have had to withdraw the amendment in the interest of  time,  because  it
would have delayed some of the preparations for the  upcoming  elections  in
2004. The amendment in question is in the long  title  of  the  Bill,  where
reference is made to "handicapped" voters. All  of  us  in  this  House  are
aware that this is a derogatory and  very  politically  incorrect  term  for
persons with disabilities.

We were advised by  the  parliamentary  law  advisers  with  regard  to  our
continuing  with  the  proposed  amendment  that  that  would  constitute  a
substantive amendment and, subsequently, the Bill would have  been  referred
back  to  the  National  Assembly  for  reconsideration  by  the   portfolio
committee, as well as approval by the House.  And,  as  I  have  said,  that
would have delayed preparations for the forthcoming elections.

It's unfortunate that the Chief Whip is  not  here.  I  wanted  to  make  an
appeal to the Chief Whip, and to you as a presiding officer, to  raise  with
the Leader of Government Business and for the Leader of Government  Business
to raise in Cabinet, as I say, generally, the matter  of  late  introduction
of all pieces of legislation. As we are aware, there are various  committees
still sitting here, when we are supposed  to  be  doing  constituency  work,
that are trying to get legislation off their desks before we  rise  for  the
end-of-the-year recess and constituency period.

Coming back to the Bill itself, the Bill makes provision for  the  amendment
of the Electoral Act of 1998 so as  to,  amongst  other  things,  limit  the
application of  the  Act  with  regard  to  municipal  councils  -  this  is
contained in clause 1  of  the  amending  Bill  -  to  make  new  provisions
regarding  voters'  rolls,  the  review  of  voting  districts  and   voting
stations; to insert a new schedule prescribing the system of  representation
in the National Assembly and provincial  legislatures  -  and  the  Minister
alluded to that, that is schedule 1A - and to make new  provisions  for  the
registration of political parties.

We had long debates around all the amendments, but I'm just going  to  touch
on what we thought, as a committee, were some of the significant  amendments
that were effected. The first amendment deals with the  application  of  the
Act, as I said, to include the election of a  municipal  council  or  a  by-
election for such council, but only  to  the  extent  stated  in  the  Local
Government: Municipal Electoral Act, Act 27  of  2000.  Municipal  elections
were excluded from the principal Act, and the Bill  before  us  attempts  to
make the Act more inclusive, rather than exclusive.

Secondly, clause 2 deals with the lowering of the age for registration as  a
voter from 18 to 16 years. This should therefore not be  confused  with  the
voting age. A person who is sixteen now can register on  8  November  and  9
November, but his or her name will only appear on the voters' roll  when  he
or she turns eighteen. So if there are any sixteen-year-olds  listening  and
watching, they are not welcome at the polls in 2004, to vote.

Thirdly, with regard to clause 4, this amendment deals with who is  eligible
to register as a voter and who is not, as  well  as  the  criteria  for  the
latter category - that's also clearly spelt  out.  A  further  amendment  to
section 8 of the  principal  Act,  8(3),  also  provides  for  a  person  to
register only in a voting district where he or she is ordinarily resident.

Clause 5 deals with the voters' roll. It  stipulates  that  only  registered
political parties, of course on payment  of  a  prescribed  fee,  will  have
access to the voters' roll and that they may only use that  information  for
purposes of the election. This is to prevent a situation in  which  all  and
sundry have access to the voters' roll and all the information contained  in
it, and then use it for all manner of purposes besides  that  of  elections.
Punitive measures are also clearly prescribed in this section.

Clause 7 of the Bill before us refers to clause 24(b) of the  principal  Act
and deals with the issue of prisoners who may vote and  those  who  may  not
vote. And, may I say, lots of discussion took place around  this  particular
clause in our committee. I'm not going to elaborate much because one  of  my
other colleagues will speak on this clause in more detail, save to say  that
besides the explanation we got from the IEC, we also  sought  guidance  from
our Constitution.

Clause 35 in the Bill of Rights deals with the  rights  of  those  who  have
found themselves in conflict with the law. To begin with,  nowhere  in  that
clause does it mention the right to vote. What it does mention  in  35(3)(h)
is the right to be presumed innocent, of course until proven  guilty.  In  a
lay person's terms, this means persons awaiting trial.  However,  clause  36
of the Bill of Rights places a limitation on all rights  and  freedoms,  and
the criteria for limiting these are also spelt out in this very clause.

The next clause, which, I think, was of significance was clause  9(1)(b)  of
the amending Bill. This clause deals with, amongst other categories,  people
who are out of the Republic on election day. The Minister  also  alluded  to
that category of people. The only category of people who will be  allowed  a
special vote on that  day  are  people  who  are  out  of  the  Republic  on
Government service or  members  of  their  families.  They  would  have  to,
however, apply for a special vote and indeed  prove  that  they  are  absent
from the Republic owing to  Government  service.  Again,  another  colleague
will elaborate on this clause.

However, amongst the motivations from the IEC was that of, in no  particular
order, infrastructure, human resources and the costs  thereof;  security  of
the ballot papers that have to be transported back to the country;  and  the
issue of restructuring the election timetables.
The last amendment which  I  thought  was  of  particular  significance  was
clause 18 of the amending Bill. This clause deals with the establishment  of
mobile voting stations. In this clause the commission is given the power  to
establish mobile voting stations in  large  and  sparsely  populated  areas.
Provinces such as the Northern Cape, the Eastern Cape, from  which  I  hail,
KwaZulu-Natal and other rural provinces come to mind, where people  have  to
travel for hours to access  facilities  and  Government  services.  This  is
another  example  of  Government's  commitment  to  bringing  services,   in
general, closer to the people. This amendment is therefore welcomed.

In conclusion, I'd like to thank the department, Adv Malatsi, who  is  here,
and his colleagues who were part of our deliberations, Adv Kelner  from  the
Office of the State Law Adviser, who assisted us and responded  to  all  our
questions adequately, members of the committee  who  vigorously  argued  and
debated, and members of the public who made submissions since the  Bill  was
first introduced in Parliament.
I want to say that no legislation is cast in stone, but is  always  open  to
amendment and improvement as time goes  on.  This  Bill,  certainly,  is  no
exception to that. As the saying goes, "the proof of the pudding is  in  the
eating". Let's dig in and identify shortcomings and,  where  there  is  room
for improvement, let's improve on those as and when they are identified.

Not forgetting my opening remarks, I  submit  to  the  House  the  committee
report that the Bill be agreed to without  further  amendments.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, our Minister here,  Dr  M  G  Buthelezi,  hon
members, as  we  move  towards  the  anniversary  of  our  first  decade  of
democracy, who can forget the first democratic election in 1994.  For  days,
people stood in long,  seemingly  unending  queues  to  cast  their  ballot.
Certainly, a measure of how far our democracy has come is to  look  at  what
has been done to improve the voting process and system.

It is in this  regard  that  the  Electoral  Laws  Amendment  Bill  must  be
examined. Critically  important  to  the  electoral  process  has  been  the
development of a process whereby people vote  on  a  voter's  roll.  Further
developments have included the electoral task  team  appointed  by  the  hon
Minister of Home Affairs, and chaired by Dr Van Zyl  Slabbert,  that  looked
into electoral models for the  country.  Although  it  is  unfortunate  that
somehow this has not materialised.

I will not dwell on the delays caused in bringing this Bill  to  Parliament,
except to say that those who raised  their  voices  casting  blame  for  the
delays appear to emanate from the very same quarters that brought about  the
delay in the first place. Despite this,  the  Minister  and  the  department
must be praised for bringing the Bill to Parliament on time for us  to  have
an election next year.

In conclusion, I must, however, add my voice to those  who  have  complained
about the disenfranchisement of voters who will be abroad on  election  day.
While one is aware that arranging voting for such people would be a  complex
undertaking, one is  equally  aware  that  it  has  been  possible  to  make
arrangements for Government employees abroad. Such inequities  run  contrary
to the  spirit  of  our  democracy.  Well,  as  our  chairperson  has  said,
naturally the proof of the pudding  in  this  Bill  will  only  be  seen  on
election day. [Interjections.] In the  eating,  on  election  day,  I  said.
[Laughter.] Perhaps those of you who will return after elections -  this  is
bitter, I know - might find it prudent to review the Bill in  that  context,
accordingly.

On behalf of my party, the IFP, we support the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms E C GOUWS: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon colleagues, this  Bill  has
been debated at length. The merits and demerits have been pointed out.  Some
have threatened with the Constitutional Court, but now I  want  my  bite  at
the cherry, and allow me to state my concerns as a caring,  loyal  supporter
and a proud South African.
Suid-Afrika is 'n land van  sonskyn,  pragtige  natuurskoon  en  vriendelike
mense. Sedert 1994 is ons 'n ware demokrasie. Hoe kan ons ooit die mense  se
entoesiasme vergeet tydens daardie eerste verkiesing. Ons  onthou  die  lang
toue mense wat geduldig ure gewag het om deel te wees van demokrasie om  met
hul kruisie hul besluit oor Suid-Afrika se toekoms te  verewig.  Voorsitter,
die reg om te stem in jou  land  van  geboorte  was  een  van  die  grootste
gebeurtenisse in hierdie land. Ons het gejuig. Baie mense het baie  lank  en
met baie opofferings en soms met baie pyn vir hierdie saak geveg. Tien  jaar
gelede was 2004 se stemgeregtigdes maar net agt jaar oud. In  die  tussentyd
het hierdie kinders van 1994 ons toekoms  geword.  Hulle  moet  help  bepaal
waarheen Suid-Afrika oppad is. Duisende van Suid-Afrika se jong  mense  moes
egter leer dat demokrasie alleen nie kos op jou tafel  bring  nie.  Daarvoor
moet jy werk. En as jou land nie vir jou kan werk bied  nie,  moet  jy  gaan
waar jy 'n inkomste kan verdien.

Ek praat hier van jong  mense  wat  in  die  buiteland  moet  gaan  werk  om
studieskuld te betaal, om geld bymekaar te kry om hier in  Suid-Afrika  waar
hulle eintlik wil wees eiendomme te koop  en  om  geld  te  verdien  om  die
familie in Suid-Afrika te ondersteun, om soos ons in plat Afrikaans  sê  die
pot aan die kook te hou. Voorsitter, dis hierdie mense wat  tydelik  in  die
buiteland is wat steeds Suid-Afrika ekonomies steun. Dis hierdie  mense  wat
my party glo die reg verdien om in  die  verkiesing  te  stem.  Dis  hierdie
mense wat meer toegerus en wyser terugkeer, dis hulle wat  deur  klousule  9
van die wetsontwerp  verhoed  word  en  hul  demokratiese  reg  om  te  stem
verbeur.

Ons moet nie net gedurig kla oor jong mense elders werk soek nie.  Ons  moet
darem van ons kant ook wys ons gee om, en wil graag hulle terugwen vir Suid-
Afrika se ekonomie. Dis onaanvaarbaar om te skuil agter  die  koste  storie.
Ons soek realiteit van beide kante. As die Regering se  amptenare  mag  stem
by ambassades, waarom nie ander Suid-Afrikaanse burgers nie?

Die finansiële probleme en administratiewe logistiek mag nie  swaarder  weeg
as die reg van  ons  burgers  nie.  Is  dit  dan  nie  presies  waaroor  die
ongelukkigheid voor '94 gegaan het nie, op kleiner  of  groter  skaal,  maar
die prinsiep is dieselfde. Mense word verhinder om hul demokratiese  reg  te
gebruik.

Oor die saak van so baie jong mense in die buiteland, nog net dít.  Werklose
mense is die grootste bron van kommer vir die Regering.  Dis  die  werkloses
wat oorgaan tot misdaad  om  te  oorleef.  Ons  tronke  is  oorvol  werklose
misdadigers. Kom ons wys eerder respek teenoor mense wat  groot  opofferings
maak om in die vreemde op 'n eerbare wyse 'n salaris te verdien om skuld  in
Suid-Afrika te kan vereffen. Daar is geen soveel 'n permanente  brein  drein
nie, maar wel moedelose werklose mense, want hierdie slim  kinders  van  ons
sal terugkom. Ons moet erkenning gee vir hul inisiatief.  Hulle  bly  steeds
lojale  Suid-Afrikaanse  burgers.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[South Africa is a country of sunshine, natural beauty and friendly  people.
Since 1994 we have been a  true  democracy.  How  can  we  ever  forget  the
enthusiasm of the people during that first election? We still  remember  the
long queues of people who patiently waited for hours in order to be part  of
democracy and, by way of their vote, to have their decision regarding  South
Africa's future registered for perpetuity. The right to vote in the  country
of one's birth was one of the greater events in this country.  We  rejoiced.
Many people had  fought  for  this  cause  for  many  years  and  with  many
sacrifices, and sometimes with great pain. Ten years  ago  the  enfranchised
for 2004 were only eight years old. In the meantime these children  of  1994
have become our future.  They  should  assist  in  determining  where  South
Africa is headed. Thousands of South Africa's youth, however, had  to  learn
that democracy itself cannot put food on one's table. For that  one  has  to
work. And if one's country cannot provide one with employment,  one  has  to
go where one can earn an income.

I refer here to young people who have to work  abroad  in  order  to  settle
their student loans, to save money in order to  purchase  property  here  in
South Africa where they would rather be, and to earn a living  in  order  to
support their family in South Africa; put in plain  language,  in  order  to
keep the pot on the boil. It is those people who are temporarily abroad  who
are still supporting South Africa economically. They are the  ones  who,  my
party believes, have earned the right to vote in  the  election.  These  are
the people who return better equipped and wiser, they  are  the  ones  being
prevented by clause 9 of the Bill and who  are  forfeiting  their  right  to
vote.

We should not only perpetually complain about  the  youth  who  are  seeking
employment elsewhere. We should at least demonstrate on  our  part  that  we
care, and that we would like to win them back for  South  Africa's  economy.
It is unacceptable to hide behind the story of costs.  We  seek  reality  on
both sides. If the Government's officials may vote  at  embassies,  why  not
other South African citizens?

The financial problems and administrative logistics should  not  weigh  more
heavily than the rights of our citizens.  Was  that  not  exactly  what  the
unhappiness before '94 was all about, on a smaller or larger scale, but  the
principle is the same? People are  being  prevented  from  exercising  their
democratic right.

As regards the issue of so many of our youth abroad,  I  just  want  to  say
this. The unemployed are the greatest source of concern for the  Government.
It is the unemployed who turn to crime in order to survive. Our prisons  are
overpopulated with unemployed criminals. Let us rather  demonstrate  respect
towards those who are making great sacrifices  by  earning  a  salary  in  a
foreign country in an honourable manner in order to settle  their  debts  in
South Africa. It is not so much a question of a  permanent  brain  drain  as
one of disheartened unemployed people,  because  these  clever  children  of
ours will return. We should acknowledge their initiative. They remain  loyal
South African citizens.]

This then is our concern about clause 9, and a  further  concern  is  around
the interest of all disabled people. In the preamble to the Bill,  reference
is made to assistance to "handicapped" voters. It is  ludicrous  to  believe
that in a modern society such as South Africa  Government  is  still  making
use of the word handicapped. The word handicapped refers to hand-in-cap.  It
is a derogatory word to the disabled community. It is unacceptable.

Regarding the substitution of section 39 of Act 73, the  DA  would  like  to
see all voting stations  comply  with  all  the  necessary  legislation  and
regulations pertaining to environmental accessibility by  disabled  persons,
including the code of practice or regulation of the SA Bureau of  Standards.
Everybody should be able to enjoy their constitutional right to vote.

The cost factor should be irrelevant, as in the case of the  overseas  South
Africans. The belief in this House and in  Government  is  that  the  DA  is
always negative and that its members are not loyal South  Africans.  Please,
get that out of your mind. It is because we are loyal that we want the  best
for our country. This Bill is not in  the  best  interest  of  our  country.
[Interjections.] This Bill disenfranchises South Africans working  in  other
countries and it discriminates against people who are  disabled.  We  cannot
support this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr J HORNE: Agb  Voorsitter,  agb  Minister  en  lede  van  die  Huis,  die
gewysigde Kieswet wat ons vandag debatteer in die Huis is en bly  belangrik.
Hierdie wet bepaal  die  gang  van  die  volgende  verkiesing  en  gaan  ook
verseker dat  die  verkiesing  eerlik,  vry  en  regverdig  is  om  sodoende
harmonie te bewerkstellig. Die wysigings wat aangebring is, is  juis  om  te
verseker dat die kiesers paraat gaan wees vir die verkiesing.

In die lig hiervan, sal die aanpassings in die wet  nie  hul  doel  dien  as
daar nie toegesien word dat die kiesers opgelei word rakende die inhoud  van
die wet nie. 'n Mens kan baie leemtes in die  wet  uitwys  soos  byvoorbeeld
dat die wet nie voorsiening maak vir die gewone mense  wat  oorsee  werksaam
is om hul stem uit te bring nie.  Hierdie  aspek  sal  egter  in  die  nabye
toekoms na  gekyk  moet  word  sodat  niemand  sover  as  moontlik  uit  die
verkiesing uitgesluit word nie. Tog is daar ander ligpunte in die wet,  soos
dat kieserslyste van adresse voorsien sal  word  wat  die  aanloop  tot  die
verkiesing sal vergemaklik.

Alhoewel die wysigings wat vandag deur die Raad goedgekeur  moet  word  deur
die NNP ondersteun word, bestaan daar tog 'n groot moontlikheid  dat  sekere
partye wat gegrief voel dat duisende van die land  se  burgers  wat  tydelik
oorsee is en wat ook belastingbetalers is nie  kan  stem  nie,  dit  na  die
Grondwetlike Hof sal neem. Dit sal gebeur, nieteenstaande die feit dat  baie
min van die land se burgers in die buiteland wel sou gestem het  indien  dit
toelaatbaar was. As die Grondwetlike Hof nou besluit dat  die  wysigings  na
die Parlement terug verwys moet word, sal dit die  verkiesing  vir  volgende
jaar in trurat sit. Ons sal dan maar moet wag en sien of dit gaan gebeur.

Ten slotte wil ek die Departement  van  Binnelandse  Sake  en  sy  amptenary
bedank vir die wyse waarop hulle die voorligting aangebied het. Ons  vertrou
dat ons volgende jaar 'n toekomsbepalende verkiesing sal  hê.  Die  Nuwe  NP
ondersteun die wet. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and members of  this  House,  the
amended Electoral Act  debated  in  this  House  today  is  and  remains  an
important Act. This Bill determines the course of  the  next  elections  and
will also ensure that the elections are honest, free and fair  in  order  to
bring about harmony. The amendments were made  to  ensure  that  the  voters
will indeed be ready for the elections.

In the light of this, the  amendments  to  the  Act  will  not  serve  their
purpose if  the  voters  are  not  trained  regarding  the  content  of  the
legislation. One can point out many loopholes  in  the  Bill,  for  example,
that the Bill does not make provision for ordinary people  working  overseas
to cast their vote. This aspect will have to re-examined in the near  future
so that as few people as possible  are  excluded  from  the  elections.  Yet
there are some other highlights in the legislation such  as  the  fact  that
the voters' lists will be provided with addresses, which would make the run-
up to the elections easier.

Although the amendments to be approved by the House today are  supported  by
the NNP, the possibility nevertheless  exists  that  some  parties  will  be
aggrieved by  the  thousands  of  the  country's  citizens  who  are  abroad
temporarily, and who are taxpayers, but who cannot vote and will take it  to
the Constitutional Court. This will happen, notwithstanding  the  fact  that
very few of our citizens abroad would have voted in any  event  if  it  were
allowed. If the Constitutional Court now decides that  the  amendments  must
be referred back to Parliament, it will throw  next  year's  elections  into
reverse. We will have to wait and see whether this is going to happen.

In conclusion, I want to thank  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  and  its
officials for the way in which they presented their  information.  We  trust
that we will have elections that will determine our future  next  year.  The
NNP supports this Bill.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Deputy Chair, hon Minister, colleagues, any Bill which  seeks
to amend the election process needs to be  considered  soberly  and  with  a
great deal of caution.

After all, we in the ANC spent considerable time  with  the  Electoral  Laws
Act to ensure that we have an electoral process that seeks  to  include  the
majority of our population  who  have  been  completely  disenfranchised  by
apartheid. Indeed, the electoral laws of any country are the window  through
which  other  countries  gain  insight  into  the  inner  workings  of  that
democracy. It is the first place where we are either condemned or lauded  as
a professed democratic nation.

We still remember, with a sense of disbelief,  the  disaster  that  followed
the United  States'  electoral  process  which  elected  George  W  Bush  as
president. The United States, I think, never really  overcame  the  election
disaster. Indeed the world took a second look  at  their  electoral  system,
often touted as the best democracy in the world, and began to  question  the
archaic voting processes. South Africa,  in  contrast,  can  be  justifiably
proud of its own system which invented the patented zip-zip  machines  which
easily read the bar codes of the voters and record instantly the details  of
the person voting.

Nonetheless, we are here today because there was a need to  investigate  our
current electoral process to verify if it completely covers all  aspects  of
the electoral process that we envisaged with the passage  of  the  principal
Act.

To this end, an electoral  task  team  was  established  in  March  2002  to
interrogate this matter. All political  parties  represented  in  Parliament
were consulted. The terms of reference of the electoral task team  included:
firstly, to develop specific proposals identifying the preferable  electoral
system  to  be  canvassed  with  the  role-players  and  stakeholders,   and
secondly, to identify constitutional parameters.

All the political parties in Parliament participated. As in any forum  where
all political parties are involved, robust interaction  followed.  The  nett
result of all this interaction is what we have before us  -  a  Bill  which,
whilst it retains the core values and principles of our  fledgling  election
system,  nonetheless  seeks  to  make  certain  adjustments  to  boost   the
Electoral Act of 1998 and the Electoral Commission Act of 1996. Some of  the
changes  were  necessary  in  certain  instances  because  sections  of  the
Electoral Act had been rendered redundant by the passage  of  the  Municipal
Electoral Act of 2000.

One area of amendment that sparked a great deal of debate was the  issue  of
prisoners being allowed to vote while in prison. The  ANC  listened  to  the
discussion very  carefully;  we  weighed  our  options  very  seriously.  In
addition, we looked at what the trends were internationally.  Interestingly,
the subject of allowing prisoners  to  vote  is  a  hotly  contested  debate
worldwide, even in democracies that have been established  for  much  longer
than ours. For the most part, there is a trend  globally  to  disqualify  at
least some categories of prisoners from voting, especially those  serving  a
lengthy sentence.

In France, some categories of  crime  have  an  automatic  disqualification.
Trial courts in Greece can  disqualify  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  Germany
disqualifies those who are convicted of offences against the  state.  Others
use varying lengths of time as  cut-off  periods:  Sri  Lanka,  six  months;
Canada, two years; New Zealand, three years, and Australia  five  years.  In
the United Kingdom and Japan, all prisoners serving sentences are  excluded.
In Denmark, Ireland, Israel,  Sweden  and  Switzerland,  all  prisoners  can
vote. No country takes such a decision lightly.

In Canada, the elections  Act  initially  disqualifies  as  a  voter  "every
person undergoing punishment as an inmate in any penal institution  for  the
commission of any offence". This was successfully challenged by  Sauvé,  who
was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder and ÿ.ÿ.ÿ.  [Inaudible].
What followed this challenge was an  amendment  to  the  Canadian  elections
Act, which prohibits from voting only prisoners serving  sentences  of  more
than two years. Their elections Act, in this  section,  therefore  reads,  I
quote: "The following persons are not  entitled  to  vote  at  an  election:
every person who is imprisoned  at  a  correctional  institution  serving  a
sentence of two years or more".

Incidentally, even the  chief  electoral  officer  and  the  assistant-chief
electoral officer are also not entitled to vote according  to  the  Canadian
electoral Act. However, even this ruling was  challenged  in  their  supreme
court,  and  it  ruled   that   blanket   prohibition   has   violated   the
constitutional rights of prisoners. The only consideration constricting  the
rights of prisoners to vote that was  upheld  was  to  have  a  case-by-case
evaluation, to avoid the arbitrary nature of the violation of the rights  of
prisoners. To the best of my knowledge, it is  still  the  current  position
that Canadian prisoners can vote if they are serving sentences of less  than
two years.

In our country, in 1999, Arnold  August  and  Veronica  Mabatho  raised  the
concern of  the  voting  rights  of  prisoners.  According  to  the  interim
Constitution, disqualification from voting existed for  those  who  were,  I
quote: "detained in a prison after being  convicted  and  sentenced  without
the option  of  a  fine  in  respect  of  any  of  the  following  offences,
irrespective of any other sentence, in  respect  of  any  offence  which  is
served concurrently with the first mentioned sentence: murder, robbery  with
aggravating circumstances and rape, and secondly, any attempt to commit  any
offence that will fit into subparagraph 1".

Even our 1996 Constitution makes no specific mention of  a  disqualification
of prisoners from voting. According to Judge Sachs, I quote: "If  Parliament
seeks to limit the unqualified right of adult  suffrage  entrenched  in  the
Constitution, it will be obliged to do so in  terms  of  a  law  of  general
application   which   meets   the   requirement   of   reasonableness    and
justifiability as set out in section 36." In fact, our  1998  Electoral  Act
was also silent  on  the  issue  of  prisoners.  The  only  disqualification
existed in the case of fraudulent applications by people who were not  South
African citizens and those who have been declared by the High  Court  to  be
of unsound mind or mentally disordered.

Indeed after much soul-searching, we concluded that prisoners, by their  own
actions, showed that they have no respect  for  the  democratic  legislative
process of our country. After a fair legal process, they were  found  to  be
guilty of violation of the law and  the  severity  of  crime  indicated  the
sentence they needed to serve. The differences that  exist  in  the  current
treatment of prisoners exist not  because  of  the  colour  of  their  skin,
religious practices, or any other reason,  but  because  of  the  nature  of
their crime against society. Even so, it has never  been  the  intention  of
the ANC to disenfranchise all prisoners, but  only  those  who  are  serious
criminals, whose actions pose a great threat to society. Therefore  the  ANC
felt that since there were instances where prisoners were serving  sentences
in prison because they have no option economically, they will be allowed  to
vote.
We therefore endorse the  amendment  that  allows  prisoners  who  have  the
option of a fine, the right to vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I must tell you  that  knowing  this  Minister  and
knowing what a fair-minded man he is, I  can't  believe  that  he  actually,
wilfully associates himself with some of the clauses in  this  Bill.  But  I
understand how Cabinet works, and I understand that the Minister is a  loyal
member of the Cabinet and is subjected to  those  constraints.  Within  that
spirit, I want to say that the provisions of the Bill, which allow only  for
Government officials and their households to vote abroad, is unimagined  and
unconstitutional. It certainly is discriminatory. My party is  also  looking
at the question of taking this matter to court.

In a free society with a free economy, where we as a nation have  opted  for
globalisation, the  natural  and  logical  consequence  of  that  policy  of
globalisation  is  that  South  Africans  would  find   themselves   abroad:
studying, serving, working abroad in the interest of our country and in  the
interest of our economy. The reality is that 70% of the GDP of this  country
is generated by imports and exports. The reality is  that  in  a  city  like
London there are 40 000 South  Africans  working  on  business  imports  and
exports to Europe.

They are as legitimate there, working in the interest  of  our  country,  as
any  Government  official  is.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is:  Why  do  we
discriminate  against  these  South  Africans  and  only  allow   Government
officials to vote? [Interjections.] Anybody working abroad ...  why  do  you
call it running away, Mr Raju? That  hon  member  needs  to  have  his  head
examined.

The fact is that our Minister of Tourism goes abroad  and  he  visits  these
South Africans, and appoints  "sunshine  ambassadors",  as  he  calls  them.
These South Africans abroad must encourage people to invest in and to  visit
South Africa, and he gives them standing. So you can work for  South  Africa
abroad, you can be a sunshine ambassador for South Africa  abroad,  but  you
cannot vote for South Africa abroad.

In my view, Minister, it is a sick joke. And  no  one  can  tell  me;  I  am
singularly well-placed, Minister, to tell you that  it  is  administratively
difficult to arrange. I was the ambassador  in  London  in  1994,  when  the
election was conducted. It was my personal responsibility ...

An HON MEMBER: For who?

Mr K D S DURR: For the Government of South Africa. I had the  responsibility
of adjudicating over that election. I  can  tell  you  that  nothing  was  a
happier occasion, and nothing could have been easier.  And  I  want  to  say
nothing brought South  Africans  more  together,  and  nothing  was  a  more
positive advertisement for our country than that.

So in South Africa today you can go to jail  and  vote,  but  you  can't  go
abroad to work for your country and  vote.  The  argument,  therefore,  that
there are administrative difficulties, is nonsense. The whole postal  voting
and special voting is a well-tried mechanism. At the  moment  the  Romanians
are voting in  a  referendum,  including  Romanians  in  South  Africa.  The
Portuguese in South Africa, the British in South Africa  and  the  Swiss  in
South Africa are voting all the time in elections in  their  own  countries.
[Interjections.] [You too ran away. As  the  ambassador  ...  This  Minister
didn't run away. This Minister has always stayed in South Africa and  fought
in the country. He never ran away, anyway. He's not a man who runs away.

I want to tell you that if political parties go abroad and raise money  from
people abroad ... [Time expired.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Chair, hon Minister and the honourable House, when  the
leaders of this country got up in the World Trade  Centre  to  draft  a  new
Constitution for  the  new  South  Africa,  they  were  in  fact  signing  a
promissory note, that all men and women, that is black  men  and  women,  as
well as white men and women, would be guaranteed the right to life,  liberty
and the vote. This was hailed as a splendid  achievement  not  only  by  the
large majority of South Africans who had previously been  denied  the  right
to vote, but it was also hailed as a step in  the  right  direction  by  the
international community. However, today we in the UCDP find it difficult  to
believe that South Africa is not defaulting on this promissory  note  in  as
far as her citizens at large are concerned.

Instead of honouring the sacred obligation, South Africa is now  giving  her
overseas citizens a bad cheque which will be dishonoured  by  the  bank  and
marked as having insufficient funds. We in the UCDP  find  it  difficult  to
believe that the bank account of the IEC is empty. After all, it is the  IEC
that proposed the amendment,  and  we  refuse  to  believe  that  there  are
insufficient funds in the great vaults of this nation.

Can we imagine what the situation would be like if  registered  voters  such
as Mark Shuttleworth, Shaun  Bartlett,  Benny  McCarthy,  Lucas  Radebe  and
others were not allowed to vote whilst being overseas? We  contend  that  as
much as is spent for their goals, why not spend for their votes as well.

The Bill by and large addresses other concerns  relating  to  the  elections
about  which  we  are  in  agreement.  However,  we  remain  hard  put   and
uncompromising  around  the  fact  that  some  South  Africans   are   being
disenfranchised by this piece of legislation.

A country such as Senegal is presently planning what to do for  such  people
during their coming election. South Africa, which is accepted as  the  torch
bearer for democracy in Africa, should surely do better  than  Senegal.  I'm
afraid, the UCDP will not vote in favour of this Bill. [Interjections.]

Ms R P MASHANGOANE: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister and  hon  members  Ntate
Tlhagale, Setswana sa re, setopo re supa nakedi, magogwe  re  mmega  a  sule
... Mr Tlhagale, in Setswana one says seeing is believing.]

We should indeed be proud, as South Africans, that we  are  approaching  our
third national democratic elections with  none  of  the  chaos  and  anarchy
which the prophets of doom predicted. We have all become familiar  with  the
term "chicken run", which refers to South Africa citizens who gave  up  hope
that a new South Africa could  exist,  spearheaded  by  a  black  President.
Needless to say, a new South Africa, which was at the same time  democratic,
prosperous and respectful of the laws of the land, emerged  from  the  ashes
of apartheid.

At present, South Africa has in  the  past  two  national  elections  proven
beyond any doubt that we  are  a  truly  democratic  country.  None  of  the
sinister rumblings of white apartheid generals plotting a white takeover  of
South Africa, or strategists plotting a crime wave  to  demonstrate  to  the
outside world that a black person cannot rule, have materialised.

In the historic first national democratic elections held in South Africa  in
1994, with no voters' rolls in place in order to check  the  eligibility  of
voters, approximately 20 million voters cast their votes, and  approximately
12 million chose to put the ANC-led Government in place, with Madiba at  its
helm.

In 1999, our second democratic elections became a little bit  more  complex.
We now had a voters' roll for which eligible  voters,  who  firstly  had  to
register with a bar-coded, 13-digit identity document, found  themselves  at
their appropriate  voting  stations  across  the  country  where  they  were
expected to cast their ballots. It was quite a learning  process  for  every
single South African, but we proved ourselves equal to the task.

So despite these necessary  restrictions,  approximately  16 million  people
voted, and again the majority of approximately 11 million  people  chose  to
continue  with  an  ANC-led  Government.  Even  with  our  first   municipal
elections held in 2000, where a new ward system  was  formulated  and  South
African citizens were once again expected to learn a new system of  electing
local government councillors, we were ready for  the  task,  thanks  to  the
R46 million voter education campaign launched by the IEC,  with  the  theme:
"Vote; it's your right." Approximately  18  million  people  turned  out  to
vote.

All these statistics show that it was no accident that the ANC  was  put  in
charge of South Africa. We will continue to be in charge for as long as  the
majority of our people  still  have  confidence  in  the  ANC's  ability  to
deliver a service with a bias  towards  the  poor  and  the  vulnerable;  is
committed to transformation and is accountable - even when  the  actions  of
its highest officials are being questioned.

The Electoral Laws Amendment  Bill  before  us  demonstrate  this  continued
commitment to  enfranchise  rather  than  to  disenfranchise.  It  therefore
attempts to improve the principal Act in  a  number  of  ways;  firstly,  by
revising voter registration, the  voters'  roll,  voting  districts,  voting
stations and voting hours; secondly, by allowing certain prisoners to  vote;
thirdly, by providing assistance to disabled persons, especially  those  who
are blind or visually impaired; fourthly, by  releasing  the  IEC  from  the
responsibility of making the decision regarding which categories  of  voters
may apply for special votes.

In the past elections, if you did not find  yourself  on  the  voters'  roll
where you were registered as a voter, you  would  find  yourself  forfeiting
the right to vote. The new amendment, section 24(a),  allows  you  to  bring
proof of your registration  to  the  polling  station  with  all  supporting
documentation, and you would then be allowed to vote.

Out of the above-mentioned  categories,  the  issue  of  special  votes  has
brought about a great  deal  of  friction  during  committee  deliberations.
Among various political parties, the special vote is a mechanism  which  our
Government utilises to allow South African citizens who will be out  of  the
country for an extended period of time, an opportunity to  cast  their  vote
in the country where they currently reside.

There were a number of inputs forwarded to accommodate those  who  would  be
travelling or residing temporarily in a foreign country during the  time  of
the elections. Parties  argued  over  why  this  should  or  should  not  be
allowed.

To a certain extent, this need has already been accommodated in  section  33
of the 1998 Electoral Act, where the  Act  accommodates  those  who  have  a
physical infirmity, disability or  pregnancy,  as  well  as  those  who  are
absent because  they  are  in  Government  service  with  members  of  their
households. This section also accommodates those who  are  in  the  security
services protecting the country.

The ANC has opted, at this point in time, not to make  provision  for  those
who are currently outside of the country for business purposes, for  studies
or on holiday. The reasons are multifaceted.  In  the  first  instance,  the
1998 Electoral Act had taken such a decision, giving powers to the IEC,  but
in the 1999 elections this proved to be too large a burden for  the  IEC  to
deal  with,  and  they  indicated  that   they   no   longer   wanted   this
responsibility to decide who qualifies for a special vote and who does not.

Secondly, after the 1999 elections, an estimated R3  million  was  spent  on
special voters, and only 2 206 votes were  cast:  636  were  from  those  in
Government services, 1 570 were cast by  those  visiting  foreign  countries
and 116 votes were rejected. These 1 570 represented  approximately  0,0098%
of the voters who voted in 1999, and approximately cost R1 900 per person.

Thirdly, we are concerned about the security of the ballot  papers.  In  the
first elections we had to deal with ballot  boxes  that  had  been  tampered
with, how much more so when there is relatively little security  that  would
ensure that votes cast will reach South Africa's shores untouched?

Fourthly, we believe  that  since  we  do  not  have  missions  in  all  the
countries where we have South African citizens, we  will  be  discriminating
against those who find themselves in a foreign country without any  mission.
[Interjections.]

The  Electoral  Laws  Amendment  Bill  also  transforms  the  way  in  which
political parties are allowed to be constituted. All parties must allow  for
freedom of association, and therefore in  their  constitution,  symbols  and
general membership cannot be discriminated against on  the  basis  or  race,
colour, ethnic group, etc.,  and  neither  can  they  allow  any  derogatory
symbol or language to form part of their make-up.

The ANC believes that the amendments indeed offer a vast improvement on  the
principal Act,  and  therefore  the  ANC  supports  this  Bill.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy Chair, I would like to thank  all
the members for the various contributions that have been made concerning  my
Bill. It is quite clear to me that there is a  constant  refrain  concerning
the issue of those who are abroad. I can only say, as the hon Mr Durr  said,
that as a member of Cabinet I am bound, actually, by the  decisions  of  the
Cabinet.

Originally I had made suggestions that this Bill might be  challengeable  in
court, as some here have in fact threatened to challenge it in  court.  But,
I abide by the decision of Cabinet. Also, as far as the delay is  concerned,
I did hint, at the beginning, that in trying to  get  the  most  appropriate
system for our country, I had appointed this task  team  a  long  time  ago.
Even the confirmation of the task team took a very long time.  There  was  a
time when  Dr  Van  Zyl  Slabbert  had  to  write  to  me,  because  he  was
embarrassed, and asked me whether he had been appointed  or  not.  Then  the
President, in his state of the nation address in Parliament, mentioned  that
he had been appointed. But, in fact, the Cabinet  had  not  confirmed  this.
So, ultimately, he was appointed.

I think that as soon as they were appointed,  they  went  about  their  task
with alacrity. Not only that, they also  held  an  international  conference
here, where  all  the  stakeholders  were  present  and  even  international
participants took part in that international conference.

And then, of course, there were two reports: the  majority  report  and  the
minority report. But Cabinet,  in  its  wisdom,  decided  to  abide  by  the
minority report. As far as personal preference is concerned, I even  stated,
when we debated this, that smaller  parties  such  as  the  IFP  would  have
preferred the status quo to remain because it favours them.

However, there is the question of accountability. As far  as  accountability
is concerned, it was clear, as recommended by the majority report,  that  we
needed to have a system that  actually  brought  about  accountability.  But
then, of course, the minority report was accepted as it stands and that  had
nothing to do with me.

And then, of course, another delay was caused  by  the  fact  that  Cabinet,
again in its wisdom, decided that the amendment should actually  be  handled
by the Department for Justice and Constitutional Development  because,  they
said, this warranted a constitutional amendment. Well, the  Bill  was  taken
out of Home Affairs and went to Justice and Constitutional Development,  for
quite a while. But, later it was decided again to  bring  it  back  to  Home
Affairs. And as soon as that was done, I acted very very briskly. There  was
no delay on my part.

Therefore I just wanted to clarify that so that members do  not  really  get
the impression that I am in any way, as a person, as  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi,
responsible for this delay; Cabinet is. Yes, I am a member of  Cabinet.  So,
we are responsible in that  sense,  having  separated  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi
from that.

I would also like to thank the chairperson of the select committee  for  her
remarks specifically, and also, of course, for proposing that there  may  be
a need, along the way, to amend this. Also, I  realise  that  for  technical
reasons it was not possible to change the word "handicap",  because  of  the
fears that it would delay the whole process. My  department  has  noted  all
the concerns that have been expressed by hon members.

Therefore, with those remarks and without further ado, I would like  to  say
thanks very much to each and every member of this  august  House  for  their
observations, their concerns etc. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic  Alliance,  African  Christian  Democratic  Party   and   United
Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

              ALTERATION OF SEX DESCRIPTION AND SEX STATUS BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Thank you, Madam Chairperson.  I'm  sure  that
hon members are more interested in this Bill than in the first one,  because
of  the  wonderful  option  that  the  Bill  offers  them.   [Interjection.]
[Laughter.]

Madam Chair, on 26 September 2003 I introduced this Bill, the Alteration  of
Sex Description and Sex Status Bill, in the National  Assembly  for  debate.
The Bill was passed, albeit with some amendments which  were  introduced  to
accommodate inputs received from affected stakeholders.

My department introduced this Bill in  an  attempt  to  realign  legislation
under its administration with the constitutional  values  contained  in  the
Bill of Rights of our Constitution. I believe  that  this  Bill  will,  once
passed into law, enhance to a great extent the right  to  human  dignity  of
those affected by it. The drafting of this Bill follows the  recommendations
of the SA Law Commission, which were  submitted  to  the  then  Minister  of
Justice, Mr A M Omar, MP.

The main objective of this Bill is to make provision for any person who  has
undergone  a  sex-change  operation,  either  by  surgery  or   by   medical
treatment, to acquire the sex organs of the  opposite  sex  to  his  or  her
biological sex. The Bill entitles such a person to apply  to  the  Director-
General of the Department of Home Affairs for the alteration of his  or  her
sex description in the national population register.

An application for the alteration of the person's sex description  shall  be
accompanied by the birth certificate of  the  applicant,  reports  from  the
medical practitioners who performed any of the processes  resulting  in  the
sex change and a report by an independent medical practitioner who  did  not
take part in any of the processes, but has performed an examination  on  the
sex appearance of the person concerned.

The Bill further provides that the Director-General of Home Affairs  furnish
written  reasons  for  any  refusal  to  register  such  an  applicant.  The
applicant can approach the magistrate's court in the district  in  which  he
or she resides for an order  authorising  the  change  of  his  or  her  sex
description.
The application to the  magistrate's  court  shall  be  accompanied  by  all
documents submitted to the Director-General of Home  Affairs  together  with
the reasons for refusal to alter the sex description. Upon  registration  of
the altered sex description, the person concerned shall be  legally  deemed,
for all  purposes  underlying  that,  to  be  the  person  of  the  new  sex
description.

The Bill also seeks to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act, Act  51
of 1992, as amended, by the insertion of a new  section,  after  section  24
thereof, to provide for the Director-General of Home Affairs to  order  that
the sex description of a person be altered in the birth  register  and  that
an amended birth certificate be issued accordingly.

The Bill introduces the following provisions:  Clause  1  provides  for  the
procedures and requirements which an applicant  who  has  undergone  a  sex-
change operation, treatment and/or evolvement  through  natural  development
resulting in a sex change, must follow in  order  to  enable  the  Director-
General of Home Affairs to alter his or her sex description in the  national
population register. It further provides for the manner  in  which  refusals
by the director-general must be made and the processes  to  be  followed  by
the applicant to appear before the magistrate either in person  or  assisted
by a legal practitioner.

Clause  2  provides  for  the  acknowledgement  of  the  alteration  of  sex
appearance, where the application to alter the sex description in  terms  of
clause 1 has been granted either by the director-general  or  an  order  has
been issued by a magistrate. This clause makes  provision  that  the  person
concerned shall, from the date of the recording in the  national  population
register, be legally deemed for all purposes to be the  person  of  the  sex
description so recorded.

Clause 2(2)  provides  that  the  rights  and  obligations  that  have  been
acquired by or accrued to such a person before the alteration of his or  her
sex description are not adversely  affected  by  the  alteration.  Clause  3
seeks to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act, Act 51  of  1992,  as
amended, by the insertion of a new clause which allows the  Director-General
of Home Affairs to order the alteration of the sex description of  a  person
in the national population register and issue an amended  birth  certificate
accordingly.

Chairperson and hon members, as a result of  the  inputs  that  we  received
from the public during the processing of this Bill, it has now been  decided
to accommodate intersexed individuals, whose sex status is reflected in  the
population register as male, to apply for the changing  thereof  to  female,
and those registered as being  female  to  male,  provided  that  they  meet
certain criteria.

I urge that this House accept the Alteration  of  Sex  Description  and  Sex
Status Bill.

Perhaps the only regret  is  that  the  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  is  not
empowered by this Bill to change the sex description of anyone.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Mr  D  M  KGWARE:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  I'm  standing  in  for   my
Chairperson, Comrade Loretta Jacobus. When this Bill was introduced  in  the
NCOP, I thought that we could disperse with  it  in  a  matter  of  minutes,
until I got a call from Estian.  I  then  realised  the  complexity  of  the
matter at hand.

May I say that  the  sentiments  I  expressed  in  my  introduction  in  the
previous Bill also hold with this one. The Constitution,  by  nature,  tends
to be all-inclusive. It removes and outlaws all forms of  discrimination.  I
refer members to clause 9 in the Bill of Rights, and  I  quote:  "The  state
may not unfairly discriminate, directly or  indirectly,  against  anyone  on
one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex or sexual orientation."

The Bill, as  it  was  introduced  in  the  National  Assembly,  excluded  a
category of persons defined as "intersexed".  It  only  made  provision  for
people who wanted to change their gender surgically  from  male  to  female,
and vice versa. It does not make provision for those who  wanted  to  change
certain sexual characteristics and not necessarily sex organs.

After  listening  to  submissions  from  the  affected  parties,   including
opinions from psychologists and social  workers,  we  were  convinced  as  a
committee that the arguments put forward to broaden the scope  of  the  Bill
were valid and in keeping with our  Constitution.  The  representative  from
the Office of the State Law Adviser was in  concurrence  with  the  proposed
amendments. After consultation with the portfolio committee, it  was  deemed
necessary to effect the proposed amendments as they were  all  pressured  to
effect any amendment, owing to the time constraints.

The proposal from the select committee  is  that  we  include  a  definition
section, with the following definitions: "amendment  to  the  Alteration  of
Sex Description and Sex Status Bill."  Some  changes  of  note  in  the  new
definitions are, I quote: "Gender characteristics" means the ways  in  which
a person expresses his or her social identity as a member  of  a  particular
sex by using style of dressing, the wearing of  processes  or  other  means;
"gender reassignment" means a process which is undertaken  for  the  purpose
of reassigning a person's sex by  changing  physiological  or  other  sexual
characteristics, including any part of such a  process;  "intersexed",  with
reference  to  a  person,   means   a   person   whose   congenital   sexual
differentiation is atypical to whatever degree.

Other amendments include, in subsection 2(c) are: "in every case,  in  which
sexual characteristics have been altered resulting in  gender  reassignment,
be accompanied by a report prepared by a  medical  practitioner  other  than
the one  contemplated  in  paragraph  (b)  who  has  medically  examined  an
applicant in order to establish his or her sexual characteristics."

A new section, section  2(d)  reads:  "In  the  case  of  a  person  who  is
intersexed,  be  accompanied  by,  one,  a  report  prepared  by  a  medical
practitioner corroborating that the applicant is  intersexed;  and,  two,  a
report prepared by a qualified psychologist or social workers  corroborating
that the applicant is living and has lived stably and satisfactorily for  an
unbroken period of at least two years in the gender  role  corresponding  to
the sex description under which he or she seeks to be registered.

In conclusion, this amendment, in my opinion, will go  a  long  way  towards
addressing  some  disparities,  inequalities  and   discrimination   against
certain sections of this  wonderful  rainbow  nation  of  ours.  It  further
emphasises  and  amplifies  one  of  the  most  fundamental  rights  in  our
Constitution, the right to choose. With these few words, I  submit  to  this
House the committee report for the adoption of the Bill  with  the  proposed
amendments. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J HORNE: Agb mev die Voorsitter, agb Minister en lede van  die  Huis,  op
die oog af lyk hierdie wetgewing soos iets wat 'n mens maar kan goedkeur  en
daarom word daar ook nie juis 'n groot bohaai daaroor gemaak nie.

Dit is egter nie hoe Jan Publiek daarbuite voel nie of dit sien nie  -  juis
omdat ons mense in die land 'n morale insinking ondergaan as gevolg van  lae
moreel. Vir 'n klein groepie mense in die land sal hierdie wetgewing  "bread
from heaven" wees. Maar is God werklik in hierdie wetsontwerp? God  is  lief
vir persone wat van die wet gebruik maak, maar is Hy lief vir  die  dade  en
aksies wat hierdie wetgewing teweegbring? Waar 'n persoon nog  getwyfel  het
of hy of sy 'n geslagsverandering sal ondergaan,  moedig  hierdie  wetgewing
vir  iemand  aan  om  dit  wel  te  doen.  Dit  bring  ook  mee   dat   daar
administratiewe  veranderings  in  die   geboorteregister   asook   in   die
bevolkingsregister moet plaasvind.

Daar sal gewaak moet word dat ons  nie  die  Grondwet  en  die  Handves  van
Menseregte as verskansings moet voorhou om wetsontwerpe goed te keur  nie  -
juis as dit die moraal van die mens aantas, want in  hierdie  geval  op  die
langer duur betaal ons die prys daarvoor in ons gemeenskapslewe. Dit is  die
reg van elke mens om keuses te maak, maar in hierdie geval kan daar met  reg
gevra word of dit nodig is - ook  as  die  duur  mediese  koste  wat  so  'n
geslagsverandering inhou ingedagte gehou word. Maar helaas,  die  demokrasie
en so ook die Grondwet spreek in hierdie  geval  die  hardste.  Ek  dank  u.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Madam Chairperson, hon Minister and members of  the  House,
on the face of it, this  legislation  looks  like  something  one  can  just
approve, and that is why there is not really a great to-do about it.

It is, however,  not  how  the  man  in  the  street  feels  or  sees  it  -
particularly because our people  in  the  country  are  undergoing  a  moral
decline as a result of low morale.  To  a  small  group  of  people  in  the
country this legislation will be "bread from heaven". But is God  really  in
this Bill? God loves people who use the law, but does He love the deeds  and
actions this legislation brings about?  Where  a  person  still  had  doubts
whether he or she would undergo a sex change,  this  legislation  encourages
someone to go ahead and do so. It also  entails  administrative  changes  in
the births register, as well as in the population register.

Care would have to be taken that we do not have to use the Constitution  and
the Bill of Human  Rights  as  entrenchments  in  order  to  adopt  Bills  -
particularly when it affects the morale of the person, because in this  case
we will pay a heavy price for it in our community life in the long  run.  It
is everyone's right to make choices, but in this case one may very well  ask
whether it is necessary - also if the high medical costs  of  a  sex  change
are  taken  into  consideration.  But  unfortunately,  democracy   and   the
Constitution speak loudest in this case. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms M P THEMBA: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, there has  been
no doubt in anyone's mind that  the  process  that  our  committee  embarked
upon, to come to terms with all the issues contained in  the  Alteration  of
Sex Description and Sex Status Bill, has been a unique learning  experience.


We have collectively reached high levels of understanding  and  empathy  for
persons who find themselves in the unfortunate position of needing to  apply
to alter their sex status and sex description. We now  know  that  to  alter
one's status  is  a  huge  undertaking  for  any  individual  who  has  been
confronted with such  a  situation.  We  have  come  to  realise  that  even
everyday occurrences become huge obstacles in  the  path  of  trying  to  go
about one's daily business.

With our new understanding, it  appears  as  if  the  main  stumbling  block
currently in existence is the lack of  legal  recognition  afforded  to  the
individuals who have decided to realign their sex status.

South Africa has birth certificates and  identity  documents  are  the  most
commonly used  and  recognised  legal  documentation  which  identifies  the
individual through various interrelated  categories.  For  example,  the  ID
number allocates the date of birth and the gender of the individual  through
a series of numbers. The first six digits  usually  represent  the  date  of
birth, while the second group of digits indicates the gender of the  person.
So with females, the second group of numbers will begin with zero, while  in
the case of males the number will begin with five. Most of us are  aware  of
this demarcation and go about without ever pushing this demarcation of  sex.


However, the issue becomes complex, as is the case with  either  transsexual
people or intersex people,  in  that  demarcation  of  sex  status  in  fact
becomes an obstacle interfering with the  individual's  right  to  lead  the
life he or she chooses to lead. So, if we as legislators  choose  to  ignore
the change in the individual's gender identity, we are in  fact  opening  up
that individual's life to further abuse, discrimination or harrassment.

Transsexual and intersexed individuals have to disclose  intensely  personal
information every time they seek employment, go to the doctor, apply  for  a
driver's licence or take out  insurance  policies,  etc.  We,  as  the  ANC,
cannot allow this kind of discrimination to continue unabated.
The category of intersexed individuals,  I  think,  was  overlooked  by  the
National Assembly's Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs. We  know  that  the
Bill, in its current format,  will  not  do  justice  to  this  category  of
individuals. So we felt that it was important to  consult  further  on  this
matter in order to ensure that this Bill includes their concerns as well.

With this group of people, nature has given these  individuals  either  both
sets of genitals and/or the chromosomal make-up of  both  sexes.  But,  even
within this category, the genitalia of both can appear in  its  totality  or
there can be elements of both sex organs where one could be  more  developed
than the other. Or in extreme cases, neither  sexual  organs  are  developed
enough to categorise as either male or female. In all of  these  cases,  how
does the powers that be classify these individuals?

We were told that in post-1975 South  Africa  doctors  made  a  decision  by
removing those organs which  were  extra  and  then  classified  the  person
accordingly, which often led to more serious consequences later in  life  as
the baby developed. Sometimes  these  types  of  corrective  surgeries  were
performed without the consent of the parent or by informing the parent  that
it was in the best interest of the child to do so. This  kind  of  behaviour
by medical practitioners left the person with this type of chromosomal make-
up with no freedom of choice to evolve and develop in the  way  they  chose.
Clearly, such behaviour cannot be condoned.

What the amendment to this Bill seeks to do is to, firstly,  recognise  that
such a category of  individuals  exists  and,  secondly,  to  protect  these
individuals through the Bill so that they can  choose  to  have  surgery  or
not.

Through the current amendment, the intersexed person  will  be  accommodated
by the Department of Home Affairs should he or she apply for  an  alteration
in his or her sex description when he or she provides  medical  reports  and
reports from a psychiatrist also corroborating that he or she is  indeed  an
intersexed person.

To the best of our knowledge, all categories of persons, be  it  transgender
or  intersexed  persons,  are  now  adequately  covered  by  the  additional
amendment agreed to by the NCOP's Select Committee on  Social  Services.  As
the ANC, we are proud that we were able to learn a great deal and  make  our
democracy work in such a meaningful way in the lives of  these  individuals.
We wish them well in their future endeavours.

The ANC strongly supports this Bill, with amendments. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister of Home  Affairs  and  hon
members, this Bill aligns the law with the Constitution. As a  country  with
a highly developed Bill of Rights, it is necessary that our legal system  be
in accordance with such principles.

Situations do arise where people, through no fault of their  own,  are  born
with characteristics of both genders in  their  bodies.  Such  people  often
have major psychological problems fitting into  society.  For  such  people,
human solutions have to be found in order  for  them  to  be  registered  as
whatever gender they are physically more inclined to be.

The Bill, however, should not be seen as an avenue for those who  just  wish
to change their gender on a whim.  Such  scenarios  could  be  exploited  by
criminals and by those of doubtful morals. I did mention that when  we  were
discussing this and  they  simply  just  laughed  at  me.  As  a  Christian,
naturally, I have concerns about such a Bill. However,  where  psychological
health issues are at stake we cannot but acknowledge the need for action  in
these limited circumstances.

Kunesisho sakwaZulu esithi, "Sazalwa nabanye,  siyofa  nabanye."  Bathe  ake
ngithi qaphu ngesiZulu, bayathanda uma ngikhuluma ngaso khona  bezoke  bezwe
lo mhlola. [Uhleko.] Enye indaba le esikhuluma  ngayo  yokushintsha  ubulili
uMdali asinike bona. Pho-ke siyakuthini?  Umthetho  wezwe  nomThethosisekelo
kufuneka sihambe ngaphansi kwawo.

Egameni  leqembu   lami,   i-IFP,   sithi   siyavumelana   nomthetho   wezwe
osezithebeni. Ngiyabonga.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[There is an isiZulu saying that says: We were born  among  a  certain  type
and we will die among other  types.  They  said  I  must  speak  briefly  in
isiZulu. They like it when  I  use  it  and  so  that  they  can  hear  this
absurdity. [Laughter.] This subject that we are  discussing  about  changing
our God-given sex identity, is such a controversial one. But, what else  can
we do? We have to observe the law of the country and the Constitution.

On behalf of my party, the IFP, we support the Bill being  discussed.  Thank
you. [Applause.]]

Ms E C GOUWS: Hon Chairperson, Minister, colleagues, the SA  Law  Commission
submitted  a  report  during  1996  on  the  investigation  into  the  legal
consequences of sexual realignment and  related  matters.  The  Bill,  [B37-
2003], provides for procedure to be followed in the event of  a  person  who
applies for the alteration of his or her gender status.

We listened to submissions and only then did I realise the difficulties  and
trauma suffered by those people. There is  a  vast  difference  between  sex
change and a person who is  intersexed.  One  of  the  persons  who  made  a
submission before the select committee said that this Bill is  not  intended
for intersexed people, but only for persons who have undergone surgery.  The
Bill is silent on the intersexed. Those people  who  went  on  a  course  of
hormones are really and truly new persons.

People who have undergone gender realignment operations can now  take  their
full place in society. After an application has  been  granted,  an  amended
birth certificate shall be issued. They  will  now  get  identity  documents
which reflect their new gender, and that will enable them to vote or  access
social benefits just like any other South African citizen.

We should look further into the problems  of  the  intersexed  people.  They
also have the right to be accepted  as  normal  people  with  amended  birth
certificates. The DA supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Ms N P KHUNOU: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, the ANC in  the
NCOP has listened very carefully to some of  the  pertinent  information  on
this unfamiliar topic, and we must admit  that  at  times,  the  information
came across as almost bizarre.

For the majority of us in the committee, it was the first time that  we  had
been confronted with this subject  matter.  We  are,  however,  very  clear,
especially after hearing all the input on  the  subject,  that  we  need  to
support this Bill together with its amendments.

From my limited exposure on this topic, it appears that the need  to  change
one's sex description and sex status is a  stark  reality  that  faces  many
people in our society today. Because the  subject  is  so  personal  to  the
individuals involved and general ignorance regarding the matter is so  high,
not many people are familiar with  the  reality  of  the  tremendous  burden
which faces far too many South Africans across the racial divide.

Imagine, for a moment,  what  it  must  feel  like  for  an  individual  who
displays all the outward appearances of a  male,  that  is  muscular  built,
beard etc, and in fact chooses to live life as a male, but has  an  ID  that
proclaims her as a female.

If I may carry this analogy a little further, this individual  tries  to  go
about the business  of  opening  banking  accounts  or  any  other  business
transactions, and receives a suspicious glance  at  the  apparent  disparity
displayed on the ID presented to the official when he tries to complete  the
transaction; and, at worst, is hauled off and  placed  before  the  policing
authority of that company to explain why he is fraudulently using the ID  of
another individual.

The immense public humiliation implied in the analogy is  just  the  tip  of
the iceberg. Over and above the public  humiliation  is  a  severe  personal
trauma that the individual has  to  endure  for  a  very  long  time  before
finding peace with himself or herself and then finally choosing to live  the
life of the opposite gender; not the least of  which  is  the  physical  and
psychological anguish that the individual has to undergo. For many who  have
finally made the decision, there is  a  punishing  regime  of  a  number  of
surgeries: hormone  therapy  and  other  treatments  to  endure  before  the
process  is  completed,  which  place  a  huge  financial  burden   on   the
individual.

With this piece of legislation,  South  Africa  is  sending  an  unambiguous
message to the outside world that we recognise and understand  the  pressure
that these individuals face. And we need to reduce, as  far  as  is  humanly
and legislatively possible, all obstacles in their way.  Indeed,  with  this
Bill  we  have  advanced  even  further  than  the  supposed   international
guidelines for the treatment of transsexual and transgender  people  namely,
the Harry Benjamin International Gender  Dysphoria  Associations'  Standards
of Care for Gender Identity Disorders.

These guidelines are regarded  as  controversial  among  transsexual  people
because of their conservative nature, especially since they  make  reference
to a general concept of transgender persons as persons with gender  identity
disorders. Yet despite this conservatism, this association recognises  that,
and I quote:


  A  clinical  threshold  is  passed  when  concerns,  uncertainties,   and
  questions about gender identity persist during  a  person's  development,
  become so intense as to seem  to  be  the  most  important  aspect  of  a
  person's life, or prevent the establishment of a relatively  unconflicted
  gender identity. The person's struggles are  then  variously,  informally
  referred to as a gender identity  problem,  gender  dysphoria,  a  gender
  problem, a  gender  concern,  a  gender  distress,  gender  conflict,  or
  transsexualism. Such struggles are known  to  occur  from  the  preschool
  years to old age and have many alternate  forms.  These  reflect  various
  degrees of personal dissatisfaction with sexual identity, sex and  gender
  demarcating  body  characteristics,  gender  roles,  identity   and   the
  perceptions of others.

Our Bill recognises that it is not necessarily  a  mental  disorder,  but  a
personal transition process. As a consequence of this process, a person  may
then decide to have his or her gender reassigned through  surgical,  medical
treatment or by evolvement  through  natural  development.  The  element  of
choice is assigned to the individual and not imposed by the state. We  heard
and have read harrowing accounts where freedom of choice was removed,  where
babies had major intrusive surgery imposed upon them  when  there  was  some
doubts as to the sex of the baby, with some dire consequences. A  repeat  of
such occurrences is what we are trying  to  avoid  at  all  costs  with  the
passage of this Bill.

This Bill gives an individual the right to choose a particular  gender  role
that he or she wants to fulfil. It obliges the Department  of  Home  Affairs
which, having recognised that such a  process  was  embarked  upon,  has  to
alter  the  sex  status  reflected  in  that  person's  ID.  This  does  not
necessarily open the floodgates to all and sundry who, upon  waking  up  one
morning, suddenly decide to change their identity.

The Bill outlines a list of requirements that an individual must  adhere  to
when applying for such a drastic  change  in  gender  identity.  Usually,  a
person has lived a life of the gender they prefer for quite  some  time  and
is completely comfortable in that  role  before  they  decide  to  make  the
change. Again, according  to  the  Harry  Benjamin  document,  the  earliest
estimates of prevalence of transsexualism in adults were 1 in 37  000  males
and 1 in 107 000 females. The most recent prevalence  information  from  the
Netherlands regarding transsexual and gender identity disorder  spectrum  is
1 in 11 900 males and 1 in 30 400 females.

At the moment we have no records as to what  the  prevalence  rates  are  in
South Africa. Nonetheless, the  public  hearings  and  personal  appeals  by
representative groups have been sufficiently  convincing  that  we,  as  the
ANC, could be guided in the direction that we have taken. As  a  result,  we
felt compelled to make substantial amendments to what the National  Assembly
had already decided upon. The  ANC  whole-heartedly  supports  the  Bill.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME  AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  I  would  like  to  thank  the
chairperson of the select committee and all members  who  have  participated
in debating this Bill. We are singing a song in  unison.  All  that  we  are
doing here is to realign this piece of legislation,  which  falls  under  my
line function, with the core values that are encapsulated  in  our  Bill  of
Rights.

I would also like to thank the NCOP for the amendments which they, in  their
wisdom, have  proposed.  I  also  wish  to  thank  hon  members  for  having
supported the Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:02.

National Council of Provinces:

Papers:

1.    The Chairperson:


     Ninth Report of the Working Group on the African Union:
     Following its Eighth Report, which was published on 22 September  2003,
     the Working Group would like to report as follows:


     1.     Draft Rules for the Pan African Parliament (PAP)


        During 2002, the Working Group commissioned research on draft rules
         for the PAP with  a  view  to  submitting  recommendations  to  the
         African Union Commission through the PAP  Steering  Committee.  The
         research report was submitted to  the  Working  Group  in  February
         2003. During August 2003, the  Speaker,  in  her  capacity  as  the
         Chairperson of the Steering  Committee,  also  received  a  set  of
         draft rules of procedure for submission to the  Steering  Committee
         from the Deputy Clerk of the Kenyan National Assembly.


        On 9 September 2003, the Working Group established a Task  Team  on
         the Rules of the PAP to consider priority areas on which  rules  of
         procedure for the  Inaugural  Session  of  the  PAP  needed  to  be
         formulated;  to  identify  rules  of  procedure  for  the   general
         functioning of the PAP and to conduct  a  comparative  analysis  of
         the draft rules emanating from  the  commissioned  research,  those
         drafted by the Deputy Clerk of the  Kenyan  National  Assembly  and
         rules of procedure of other regional Parliamentary bodies.


        The Working Group identified the  following  issues  for  immediate
         consideration by the Task  Team:  (i)  Oath  of  office  or  solemn
         declaration; (ii) Election  of  office  Bearers;  (iii)  Rules  for
         decision-making; (iv) Rules of Debate; (v) Regional  caucuses;  and
         (vi) Committees.


        The  Task  Team  met  on  18  September  2003  and  its  views  are
         incorporated in this  report  which,  inter  alia,  contains  broad
         principles around the Rules of Procedure.


         (1)     Oath of office or solemn declaration


             Article 13 of the PAP  Protocol  provides  that  at  its  first
              sitting, after election and before proceeding with  any  other
              matter, the Pan African Parliamentarians shall take an oath or
              make a solemn  declaration  which  shall  be  set  out  as  an
              addendum to this Protocol.


             Various options in respect of who  would  administer  the  oath
              could be considered amongst which would be the Chairperson  of
              the  Assembly  of  the  AU  or  the  Chairperson  of  the   AU
              Commission. The Working Group recommends that the  Chairperson
              of the Assembly administers the initial taking of the oath  or
              making of a solemn declaration, as the inauguration would be a
              continental ceremony. However, a Rule  must  provide  for  the
              administering of  the  oath  or  declaration  thereafter  with
              regard to new members as it would be a continuous process. The
              swearing-in process does not require a Rule.  The  manner  for
              conducting the  swearing-in  would  be  a  logistical  matter.
              Members could be called up in groups of five or ten,  with  an
              acknowledgement of the countries from which they come.


         (2)     Election of Office Bearers
              Article 12(2) of the Protocol provides that the  Pan  African
              Parliament shall elect, at its  first  sitting  following  its
              election, by secret ballot, from  among  its  members  and  in
              accordance with its Rules of Procedure, a President  and  four
              (4) Vice Presidents representing  the  Regions  of  Africa  as
              determined by the OAU. The election shall, in each case, be by
              simple majority of the members present and voting.


              The Working Group expressed the view that the  AU  Commission
              could facilitate the administration of the election of  Office
              Bearers.


              (a) Procedures of Nominating
                  The Working Group recommends that the Steering  Committee
                  should, once sufficient ratifications are  deposited  with
                  the  AU,  request  regions  to  start   the   process   of
                  nominating candidates for both  the  Presidency  and  Vice
                  Presidency of the PAP.


                  The AU Commission would be the suitable central  body  to
                  monitor  nominations  by  regions.   There   was   general
                  consensus  on  the  need   for   time   limits   regarding
                  submission of nominations, as ballot papers would have  to
                  be prepared timeously.  However,  time  limits  should  be
                  flexible to allow for the  smooth  running  of  democratic
                  processes within regions. It would be important to  record
                  on the nomination  form  whether  the  candidate  accepted
                  his/her  nomination.  Consideration  should  be  given  to
                  whether  there  should  be  a  fixed  number  of   persons
                  supporting the nomination of a candidate.


                  The Working Group felt that the Steering Committee should
                  not  be  prescriptive  in  regard  to  regions  concerning
                  procedures for nominations, but it  may  wish  to  provide
                  guidelines as regards the process and timeframes.


                  The Rules should also provide for  a  situation  where  a
                  region was unable to forward  a  nomination.  The  Working
                  Group, however, felt that in the  absence  of  a  regional
                  nomination,  other  regions  should  be   free   to   make
                  nominations from the defaulting region.


                  Parliament would need guidance  from  the  Department  of
                  Foreign Affairs as to what the position was as  regards  a
                  host country wishing to  nominate  a  candidate  or  being
                  nominated by another country.


              (b) Method of Voting
                  Rules would need to be formulated on the following:
                  (i) Ballot for election of President and Vice Presidents;
                  (ii)  Results  of  Voting;  (iii)  Reporting  of  Results;
                  (iv)Procedure if there is  no  successful  candidate;  and
                  (v) Taking of Chair by President.


                  Consideration should be given to a situation  that  could
                  arise should there  be  a  query  regarding  the  election
                  results. The Working Group felt that there might not be  a
                  need for a specific Rule covering this aspect.


         (3)     Rules for decision making
             According to Article 12 (11) of the Protocol, the quorum for  a
              meeting of the Pan African Parliament shall be constituted  by
              a simple majority.  Article  12  (12)  states  that  each  Pan
              African Parliamentarian shall have one vote.  Decisions  shall
              be made by  consensus  or,  failing  which,  by  a  two-thirds
              majority of all  the  Members  present  and  voting.  However,
              procedural matters, including the question of whether a matter
              is one of procedure or not,  shall  be  decided  by  a  simple
              majority  of  those  present  and  voting,  unless   otherwise
              stipulated in the Rules of Procedure. In the event of an equal
              number of votes, the person presiding  shall  have  a  casting
              vote.


              Voting Procedure
              Apart from the election of Office Bearers of  the  Parliament
              for  which  an  election  procedure  was  prescribed  in   the
              Protocol, a situation might arise which would require  certain
              decisions to be taken during the first session  e.g.  adoption
              of rules of procedure.


             In this regard, Rules would need to be formulated on areas such
              as (i) Declaration of Vote;  (ii)  the  Manner  of  Voting  on
              Specific Questions; and (iii) What happens should there not be
              consensus.


         (4)     Rules Of Debate
             Rules should also be formulated on the following:(i) Address of
              Chair by Members; (ii) Calling of Members; (iii)  Time  Limits
              for Speeches; (iv) Reference to Member by name; (v)  Offensive
              Language; (vi)Explanations; (vii) Points of Order/Interruption
              of  Debates  and  Speeches;  (viii)  Rights  of   Members   to
              Speak/Freedom of speech; (ix) Closure of Debate; (x) Scope  of
              Debate; (xi) Conduct of Members during Debate; (xii)  Role  of
              President in Debate; and (xiii) Disciplinary measures.


         (5)     Regional caucuses
             Article  18  of  the  Protocol  states  that  the   Pan-African
              Parliament  shall  work  in  close   co-operation   with   the
              Parliaments of  the  Regional  Economic  Communities  and  the
              National Parliaments or other deliberative  organs  of  Member
              States. To this effect, the Pan  African  Parliament  may,  in
              accordance  with  its  Rules  of  Procedure,  convene   annual
              consultative  meetings  fora  with  the  Parliaments  of   the
              Regional Economic Communities and the National Parliaments  or
              other  deliberative  organs  to  discuss  matters  of   common
              interest.


             Regions would play a vital role in the Pan African  Parliament.
              The Working Group was of the view that it was not necessary to
              formulate  a  Rule  detailing  the  functioning  of   regional
              caucuses within  the  PAP.  However,  there  ought  to  be  an
              arrangement for regional caucuses to meet and discuss  issues,
              inter alia, with a view to formulating regional  positions  on
              specific matters.


         (6)     Committees
              Article 12(13) of the Protocol provides that the Pan  African
              Parliament may establish such committees as it deems  fit  for
              the proper discharge of its functions and in  accordance  with
              its Rules of Procedure.


             The Working Group  felt  that  particular  in-house  committees
              would need to be established during the first session  of  the
              PAP to facilitate the smooth running of the institution. These
              committees could deal with issues such as  (i)  Rules  of  the
              PAP; (ii) the budget; and (iii) programming of  business.  The
              Working Group has requested the Task Team to consider  further
              the specific functions of the proposed committees.


              Rules would therefore be necessary to  provide  for  the  (i)
              types of PAP committees  ("In-house"  and  "Portfolio");  (ii)
              Composition; (iii) Terms of Reference; (iv) Terms  of  Office;
              (v) Quorums;  (vi)  Decision-making;  (vii)  Meetings;  (viii)
              Reporting (ix) Powers and Functions; and  (x)  Publication  or
              Disclosure of Proceedings, Evidence, Reports, etc .


              A political management structure should be in place after the
              election of the Bureau to ensure that  the  necessary  support
              was given to the new institution. It would be  vital  for  the
              Commission to give consideration to this question.


         (7)     Appointment of staff
              The process of appointment of the Clerk and Deputy  Clerk  of
              the PAP would need to be discussed at the  Inaugural  Session.
              It was noted that as per the Protocol, the  staff  of  the  AU
              Commission would support the Bureau until such time as the PAP
              staff were appointed.


         (8)     Languages
              Article 25 of the  Constitutive  Act  of  the  African  Union
              states that the working languages of the  Union  and  all  its
              institutions shall be, if possible, African languages, Arabic,
              English, French and Portuguese.


              Consideration should be given to the use at the PAP  of  Sign
              Language and Braille.


     2.     Fourth Seminar on the African Union
          In its Eighth Report, the Working Group recommended that a seminar
         be held before the end of the 2003 Parliamentary session.  To  this
         end, the Working Group has agreed on the following  key  objectives
         for the Seminar:


         (i)     To enhance the understanding of the Pan African  Parliament
                amongst Members of the South African Parliament;


         (ii)    To foster institutional engagement  on  the  African  Union
                with particular reference to the Pan African Parliament; and


         (iii)   To empower  Members  to  have  ongoing  dialogue  with  the
                people of  South  Africa  and  embark  on  public  awareness
                activities with respect to the Pan African Parliament.


         The Working Group recommends that the Seminar be scheduled  for  20
         October 2003. Further, consideration should be  given  to  inviting
         certain individuals to  participate  in  the  Seminar  as  resource
         people.


     Report to be considered.

     on the Criminal Procedure Amendment  Bill  [B  57B  -  2002]  (National

         The  Select  Committee  on  Security  and  Constitutional  Affairs,
         having considered the subject of the Criminal  Procedure  Amendment
         Bill [B 57B - 2002] (National Assembly - sec 75), referred  to  it,
         reports the Bill with a proposed amendment, as follows:


         CLAUSE 8


         1. On page 11, in line 52, to omit "1 November 2003 or any  earlier
              date as the President may determine" and to substitute "a date
              fixed by the President".


              The Select Committee further reports as follows:
              The amendment being proposed in respect of Clause 8 relates to
              a matter of some concern to the Select Committee. The Bill was
              introduced in the National Assembly during the 2002 session of
              Parliament. The National  Assembly  amended  the  commencement
              clause so as to provide for commencement by not later  than  1
              November 2003. This has surely created  an  expectation  among
              those involved in  the  administration  of  justice  that  the
              provisions of the Bill, which are aimed at addressing a  cause
              of serious and unnecessary  delays  in  the  criminal  justice
              system, will commence by  not  later  than  1  November  2003.
              However, this places the National Council of  Provinces  under
              considerable pressure to deal with this legislation, that  has
              been with the National Assembly for  approximately  one  year,
              within the  space  of  three  to  four  weeks.  Also,  in  the
              respectful opinion of the Select Committee,  it  places  undue
              pressure on the President to  assent  to  and  sign  the  Bill
              before the 1st of November 2003. It should be  borne  in  mind
              that, under section 79(1) of the Constitution,  the  President
              must either assent  to  and  sign  the  Bill  or,  if  he  has
              reservations about the  constitutionality  thereof,  refer  it
              back to the National Assembly for reconsideration. The  Select
              Committee is therefore respectfully of the  opinion  that,  in
              the present circumstances,  Clause  8  should  be  amended  as
              proposed by the Select Committee,  and  that  care  should  in
              future be taken to avoid situations where the Council and  the
              President are perceived to be  unduly  pressurised  to  concur
              with, or assent to, new legislation.


     Report to be considered.
