 DIET PROPOSED BY MINISTER OF HEALTH FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS SAID TO
                           BE RAISING FALSE HOPES

                             (Notice of Motion)

Mr M WATERS: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that the SA Medical Journal has found that the diet proposed by
       the Minister of Health for people living with HIV/Aids is of  no  use
       in altering the course of the disease and, in fact,  might  harm  the
       health of patients; and


  (2) censures  the  Minister  for  raising  false  hopes  by  promoting  a
       concoction of garlic, virgin olive oil and the African  potato  plant
       as a treatment, while dragging her heels on the antiretroviral  roll-
       out which offers real hope  for  retarding  the  progression  of  the
       disease.

Agreed to.

The SPEAKER: Notice will be taken.

                             VOTER REGISTRATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker,  I  hereby  move
without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Independent Electoral  Commission  conducted  a  weekend  of
           national voter registration on 8 and 9 November 2003; and


       (b)  on these days thousands of South Africans registered  as  voters
           and many more checked whether they are correctly  registered  as
           voters;


  (2) commends all those South Africans who made sure that they  are  in  a
       position  to  exercise  their  democratic  right  to  determine   our
       country's future;


  (3) calls upon all South Africans to -


       (a)  continue registering as voters in the voting district where they
           live; and


       (b)  change their registration to a new voting district  should  they
           have moved since the elections of 1999 or 2000;


  (4) commends the management and staff of the IEC for their efficient  and
       dedicated work; and


  (5) urges all sectors of our society  to  continue  contributing  to  the
       national effort to deepen democracy in our country.

Agreed to.

                   RAMADAAN MUBARAK WISHES FOR ALL MUSLIMS

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  during the holy month of Ramadaan, Muslims in South  Africa  are
           abstaining from food and drink from dawn to dusk and are engaged
           in prayers and meditation in mosques throughout our country; and


       (b)  fasting in this holy Muslim  month  creates  awareness  of,  and
           solidarity with, the poor and needy, encouraging charity and the
           sharing of basic needs; and


  (2) wishes all Muslims a Ramadaan Mubarak.

Agreed to.

 ALTERATION OF MOTION ON ORDER PAPER: REFERRAL OF MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY
     STATEMENT, ETC. TO PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE AND JOINT BUDGET
                         COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam  Speaker,  on  behalf  of
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the  draft  resolution  printed
in his name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement  and  related  papers,  upon
  tabling, be referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance and the  Joint
  Budget Committee for consideration in accordance  with  their  respective
  mandates.


Agreed to.

                     ANC-LED GOVERNMENT IMPROVES ECONOMY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S M RASMENI(ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC has managed  not  only  to  hold
the country's economic decline, but also to turn  the  ecomony  around  from
the negative per capita growth rate in the decade before 1994.  The  economy
has grown since then at the average  rate  of  2,8%.  The  people  of  South
Africa have, through working together, turned the economy around.

When the first democratically elected Government  of  South  Africa  assumed
the reigns of power in 1994 the economy was in  a  state  of  near  terminal
decline. Confidence in the economy  has  reached  record  high  levels.  The
Sacob Confidence Index and the Rotas Econometer last month both  measured  a
surge to record highs.

On the side of delivery to our people change is also visible.  Last  Friday,
7 November, the editorial of the daily newspaper This Day had  this  to  say
on Government's delivery methods:


  A large number of our people previously denied  basic  services  are  now
  able to access water, electricity, housing and education.

This is a fact. Those who say  something  to  the  contrary  are  trying  to
mislead people and  the  world.  The  victories  we  have  fought  serve  to
emphasize the need to continue working together as a country and  a  people,
to seek solutions to the challenges that still confront us. [Time expired.]

         VOTING RIGHTS FOR SOUTH AFRICANS WHO ARE TEMPORARILY ABROAD

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I J PRETORIUS (DA) Madam  Speaker,  I  announced  that  I  am  tabling  a
Private Member's Bill to amend the Electoral Act. The purpose is to make  it
possible for South Africans  who  are  temporarily  abroad  on  holiday,  on
business or for study purposes to cast their votes. That  was  the  original
intention of the Minister of Home Affairs  and  the  majority  view  of  the
members of the portfolio committee. What a  pity  that  the  ANC  leadership
interfered and forced  the  committee  to  back  down.  I  warned  that  the
democratic right of the people of South Africa to vote was being removed  by
the ANC and that was a sad day for South Africa.

I understand that the ANC is having second  thoughts  after  representations
by the DA and other political parties.  The  Electoral  Act  should  not  be
controversial. It should ideally be negotiated and  agreed  to  between  all
significant parties. Instead of introducing  an  amending  Bill,  I  suggest
that my Private Member's Bill be taken over by the  Minister  and  then  put
through Parliament urgently.

                             CERTIFICATE OF NEED

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP):  Madam  Speaker,  the  requirement  prescribing  that
doctors must apply to the director-general for a  certificate  of  need  has
already resulted in the Prescribing Doctors' Association  taking  Government
to court. A similar requirement in the National Health Bill for  all  health
practioners to apply  for  a  certificate  of  need  is  causing  widespread
concern among the medical fraternity,  resulting  in  doctors  moving  their
services away from South Africa.

Some practise overseas for part of  the  month  while  they  live  in  South
Africa, while others are  leaving  South  Africa  to  settle  overseas.  The
certificate of need therefore will have  the  opposite  effect  to  the  one
desired of moving  doctors  out  to  underserved  areas.  The  IFP  strongly
opposes the certificates  of  need  and  calls  on  Government,  before  the
regulations for the National Health Bill are promulgated,  to  consider  the
alternative ways we  have  proposed  for  improving  the  number  of  health
practitioners in underserved areas.

The IFP advocates the following measures: Firstly, to  offer  incentives  to
doctors to practise in rural and underserved areas. Secondly, to apply  fair
and  objective  criteria  for   registration   and   licensing   of   health
professionals. Thirdly, to spend increased Government  money  in  rural  and
underserved  areas  with  the  co-ordinated  rural  development   programme.
Fourthly,  to  offer  contracts  to  health  NGOs  and  top  private  health
companies to manage rural clinics and  hospitals.  Fifthly,  to  change  the
narrow approach  to  foreign  qualified  doctors,  which  encourages  mainly
Cubans to  strengthen  our  complement  of  doctors  in  rural  areas.  This
balanced  approach,  which   combines   regulation,   private   and   public
partnerships and freedom of choice, will benefit all concerned and have  the
effect that the certificate of need is supposed to have, but doesn't.

                             VOTER REGISTRATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B M SOLO (ANC) Madam Speaker, the 8 and 9 November  were  set  aside  for
the voter registration.  This  was  done  in  preparation  for  next  year's
general elections. We want to thank all those South Africans  who  went  out
to register in order to vote and  those  who  checked  whether  their  names
still appear on the voter's roll.

As South Africans we want to have free, fair  and  well-organised  elections
next year. If this objective is to be realised, we all need to  go  out  and
check if our names are on  the  voter's  roll  or  re-register  if  we  have
changed our place of residence.

Furthermore, voters need to register and people must register in their  area
of residence. We call on all our  people  to  visit  their  local  municipal
offices to check their names  any  time  during  the  week.  Throughout  the
history of our liberation struggle and the  reconstruction  of  our  country
the youth have played a central role in shaping and determining the  destiny
of our country.  The  youth  of  our  country  cannot  afford  to  miss  the
opportunity to register and finally vote for a Government of  their  choice.
We cannot afford to betray the  rich  legacy  of  our  past.  We  call  upon
everyone to register now and vote for  the  ANC  next  year.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

                             OPPOSITION POLITICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B L GELDENHUYS (Nuwe NP): Agb Speaker, met die  verkiesing  wat  oor  vyf
maande plaasvind, is dit baie belangrik om die rol van opposisiepolitiek  in
Suid-Afrika onder die loep te neem.

Vandat die ANC hom verbind het  tot  'n  hoofsaaklik  markgerigte  ekonomie,
staan geen politieke party wat hom regs van die ANC posisioneer 'n  kans  om
die volgende regering te vorm nie. Met ander woorde, die agb Leier  van  die
Amptelike Opposisie se kans om die volgende President te word, is  net  mooi
nul. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Sonder om deel te wees van die besluitnemingsprosesse kan 'n  opposisieparty
nie 'n enkele huis bou nie,  nie  'n  enkele  werkgeleentheid  skep  nie  en
allermins misdaad beveg - soos wat die DA voorgee hulle gaan doen.

In  'n  land  soos  Suid-Afrika  waar  huidige  politieke  opponente  mekaar
letterlik vanuit die loopgrawe beveg het in 'n  lae-intensiteit  oorlog,  is
die Britse model van opponerende politiek in elk geval nie geskik vir  Suid-
Afrika of vir nasiebou nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

'n Konsensus-soekende model van  samewerkende  regering,  in  terme  waarvan
minderheidspartye  met  behoud  van  identiteit  inspraak  kan  kry  in  die
besluitnemingsprosesse, is  veel  meer  geskik  vir  Suid-Afrika.  Dit  stel
minderheidspartye in staat om effektief iets vir hul ondersteuningsbasis  te
doen. Dís wat die ooreenkoms tussen die  ANC  en  die  Nuwe  NP  behels,  en
daarom kon die Nuwe NP op sy registrasieplakkate skryf, ``Laat jou  NNP-stem
tel''. [Applous.] [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP):  Hon  Speaker,  with  the  elections  that  are
taking place in five months' time it is very important  to  examine  closely
the role of opposition politics in South Africa.

Ever since the ANC committed itself to a primarily market  centred  economy,
no political party that positions itself to the right of the  ANC  stands  a
chance of becoming the next government. In other words, the  chance  of  the
hon Leader of the Official Opposition becoming the next  President  is  just
about zero. [Interjections.]

Without participating in the decision-making processes an  opposition  party
cannot build a single house, create a single job opportunity  and  least  of
all fight crime - such as the DA maintains that they are going to do.

In a country such as South Africa, where current  political  opponents  were
literally fighting one another from the trenches in  a  low  intensity  war,
the British model of opposing politics is in any case  not  appropriate  for
South Africa nor for nation-building.

[Interjections.]

A consensus-seeking model of co-operative  government,  in  terms  of  which
minority parties, retaining their identity,  can  participate  in  decision-
making processes, is far more  appropriate  for  South  Africa.  It  enables
minority parties to do something effectively for their  support  base.  This
is what the agreement between the ANC and the New NP entails, and  for  that
reason the New NP could write on its registration posters, ``Laat  jou  NNP-
stem tel''. [Applause.] [Interjections.]]

The SPEAKER: Order! Elections have not been announced as yet,  hon  members.
Order!

        CORRUPTION IN LIQUIDATION INDUSTRY AND MASTERS BUSINESS UNIT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S N SWART (ACDP): Madam Speaker, the ACDP calls for a full  inquiry  into
allegations  of  nepotism  and  widespread  corruption  in  the  liquidation
industry. Such an inquiry could be based on  the  Jali  Judicial  Commission
into alleged corruption in the Department of Correctional Services.

According to the Chief State Law Adviser, Mr Enver Daniels,  who  is  acting
head of the Masters Business Unit in the Department of  Justice,  corruption
is so widespread that liquidators and civil  servants  ``often  see  nothing
wrong with it''. Mr Daniels says  that  incentives  are  passed  by  corrupt
liquidators to equally corrupt staff in the Masters Business  Unit.  He  was
``shocked and surprised'' at the extent of corruption in the unit -  finding
a sense of almost lawlessness at the Master's office in Pretoria.

The ACDP  also  requests  that  the  allegations  of  corruption  by  deputy
director-general  and  former  Masters  Business  head,  Mr  Tshishonga,  be
investigated, as well  as  whether  any  impropriety  was  involved  in  his
transfer away from the Masters Business Unit, following his  allegations  of
nepotism against the Minister of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development.
These allegations are of a very  serious  nature  and  require  a  full  and
comprehensive investigation.

If the Hefer Commission of Inquiry can be held at great  public  expense  to
investigate spy claims, surely  it  is  in  the  public's  interest  that  a
commission be set  up  to  investigate  this  industry,  worth  R18  billion
annually. Thank you.

                      SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU (ANC): Madam Speaker, earlier this month a  delegation  of
the ANC, led by President  Thabo  Mbeki,  attendend  the  22nd  Congress  of
Socialist International,  the  world's  largest  organisation  of  political
parties.

This organisation consists of some of the most progressive  parties  of  all
countries. The 22nd congress met under the theme: ``The return  of  politics
for just and  responsible  governance;  for  globalistion  governed  by  the
people''.

Under this theme, and in pursuance of Socialist  International's  commitment
to progressive transformation globally in order to address the interests  of
the poor, the congress discussed a wide range  of  subjects,  including  the
multilateralist system of  governance;  the  world  economy,  including  the
struggle against poverty; gender equality and  the  emancipation  of  women;
and the strengthening of democracy.

The ANC supports the call by Socialist International for  united  action  to
promote a new world  order,  based  on  a  new  multilateralism  for  peace,
security, sustainable development, social justice, respect for human  rights
and gender equality.

We do so, because the successful resolution of all  these  problems  relates
directly to the task of the renewal of our country  and  continent  and  the
provision of a better life for all our  people  and  all  the  poor  of  the
world. I thank you.

                           NATIONAL AIDS STRATEGY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G T MADIKIZA (UDM): Madam Speaker, the UDM welcomes the editorial in  the
most recent edition of the  South  African  Medical  Journal,  which  states
clearly and unambigiously that there is a lack of  evidence  supporting  the
benefits of lemon juice, garlic and  olive  oil  salad  dressing,  something
which the Minister of Health continues to peddle as a  solution  for  people
living with HIV/Aids.

The continued absence of a comprehensive  national  strategy  to  deal  with
HIV/Aids is an indictment of the Government, given that hundreds  of  people
die weekly and millions more are infected with the disease.

What this editorial reflects is the growing  frustration  of  South  African
health   care   professionals   with   the   foot-dragging,    delays    and
procrastination by Government when it comes to HIV/Aids.

The UDM anxiously awaits the announcement of the medium-term  budget  policy
statement this week by  the  Minister  of  Finance.  This  will  provide  an
opportunity to evaluate exactly what priority Government really attaches  to
the fight against this pandemic. Thank you.

                             VOTER REGISTRATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I S MFUNDISI  (UCDP):  Madam  Speaker,  there  is  no  doubt  that  South
Africans are gearing themselves for the 2004 elections, but not  all  people
are excited about the matter. We have noticed some  reluctance,  apathy  and
in some cases vocal rejection regarding the  registration  process,  because
of some or other promise that was not fulfilled.

One issue that is being played down by the Government is the one around  the
cross-border municipalities. So far, people living in these  areas  are  not
sure in which, and for which, province they will be voting. On enquiry  into
this matter, people are sent from pillar to post. The  IEC  says  that  they
are sticking to the demarcation as approved and accepted, despite  the  fact
that this was meant for the local government elections in 2000.

Some parties may be aware of what is going  on,  while  others  are  in  the
dark. We call for transparency on the matter, as lack thereof  would  affect
preparations  for  the  elections.  If  the  affected  areas   are   to   be
incorporated into the provinces to which those  municipalities  belong,  the
time has come for all interested parties and the general public to know  the
facts.

Statements by people in high places to the effect that  such  incorporations
would take place have been bandied about without much substance in them.  We
believe  the  time  has  come  for  such  incorporation,  necessitating   an
amendment to the Constitution if the boundaries of provinces  are  going  to
be affected.

People cannot be made to  live  in  doubt  and  remain  uncertain  to  which
province they have to give allegiance. The bad status they have assumed  has
to be ended, so that when they go to the elections they  know  whether  they
belong to this or that province.

The UCDP calls on those keeping the information and the fate of  the  people
living in cross-border municipalities to stand up  and  speak  out  on  this
matter. I thank you.
                PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN AFRICAN PARLIAMENTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  Africa  has  produced  a
world leader in terms of women representation  in  parliament.  Rwanda  tops
the  Inter-Parliamentary  Union  world  ranking   of   women   in   national
parliaments. After the result of the recent elections in Rwanda,  women  now
comprise 48,8% of the National Assembly of this African country.

We would like to express our elation at the manner in which  the  democratic
process is evolving in Rwanda, putting at the top of its agenda the role  of
women and placing them in their  rightful  position  as  decision-makers  in
society. These positive developments take place against a  backdrop  of  the
world average of women's participation in public representative work  having
reached one of its highest ever levels.

As the ANC, having  championed  and  fought  for  gender  equality  and  the
emancipation of women for decades, we believe that  these  developments  are
indeed very good news. We commend the  people  of  Rwanda  for  blazing  the
trail towards  gender  equality  and  proportionate  representation  between
women and men. This positive step must now be solidified by the creation  of
a culture which values, fundamentally, the equality of men and women in  all
sectors of their society. I thank you. [Applause.]

               PUBLIC KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Madam  Speaker,  six  weeks  ago  the  report  of  the
Commissioner of Police was published.  It  contained  crime  statistics  and
trends which were between  18  months  and  six  months  out  of  date.  The
commissioner and the Minister have  up-to-date  statistics;  they  get  them
every week. But MPs, members of the portfolio committee and the  public  are
kept in the dark.

The Minister is a very nice man. What a pity it is that  his  background  is
antidemocratic! He believes that Big Brother knows best.  His  big  brothers
were Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev.

My tradition believes that it is not the state but the people who count.  My
tradition believes that the individual human being knows what  is  good  for
her, far better than any Cabinet Minister. [Interjections.] The  people  are
entitled to know the crime trends, and tomorrow I will  be  serving  on  the
hon Minister  a  new  request  in  terms  of  the  Promotion  of  Access  to
Information Act. The people have the right to  know,  and  the  Minister  is
wrong to treat adults like children.

                           ARRIVAL OF SAS AMATOLA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N S MIDDLETON (IFP): Madam Speaker, ever since the Government decided  to
embark on the strategic arms procurement process, the issue has been at  the
very top of our national agenda. Controversy has dogged the entire  process.
Allegations of corruption have been made and investigated,  and  still  many
questions remain unanswered.

On the other side of the coin, there was some good news  last  week  as  the
first of the SA Navy patrol corvettes, built in Germany, entered our  waters
and docked in Simon's Town. The SAS Amatola was delivered on  time  and  can
now be fitted locally to become operational.

Further good news is that three quarters of the ship's  combat  system  will
be built by South  African  companies,  and  that  an  additional  10  local
companies participated in the  construction  of  the  hull  and  the  ship's
machinery. All that must surely translate into employment  opportunities  in
and the maintenance of hi-tech skills for use  in  the  South  African  arms
industry. Another three of the German-built corvettes will be  delivered  in
years to come, together with German-built submarines.

In the final analysis, these acquisitions will ensure that the SA  Navy  can
yet again execute its mission in our territorial waters, be  in  a  position
to retain the already trained personnel and embark on training a  generation
of sailors known as ``terras''.

                             VOTER REGISTRATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M MAUNYE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC wishes to thank  the  multitudes
of South Africans that registered over the past weekend as  voters  and  the
others that checked their status  in  this  regard.  We  thank  these  South
Africans for taking their future into their own hands.  They  have,  through
this process, ensured that they have placed themselves in a position  to  be
ready to contribute to the process of deepening our hard-won democracy.

The  ANC  believes  that  the  ongoing   process   of   transformation   and
reconstruction needs to be driven by the people. The people need  to  decide
which direction this process should  take  and  which  organisations  should
have the mandate to undertake this process in Government.

We urge all South Africans, particularly  the  youth,  to  register  and  to
participate in the elections in great numbers to  ensure  that  they  direct
the future they will live in. Let us register now.  Our  future  is  in  our
hands. Thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

                                POLICE ACTION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr J SCHIPPERS (Nuwe NP): Speaker, die  heldhaftige  optrede  van  die  26-
jarige polisievrou, konstabel Vanana Makutle,  vereis  eervolle  vermelding,
want nie net het sy haar lewe op die  spel  geplaas  toe  sy  27  gevaarlike
misdadigers voorgekeer en na hulle selle teruggedwing het toe hulle  probeer
ontsnap het nie; sy het dit ook vrou-alleen gedoen.

Té gereeld hoor ons van korrupsie in die SAPD,  asook  van  polisielede  wat
self met kriminele  vervolging  te  kampe  het.  Die  vrot  appels  mag  nie
toegelaat word om die SAPD in 'n slegte lig te stel nie.

Konstabel Makutle is 'n aanwins  vir  die  SAPD  en  haar  optrede  stel  'n
voorbeeld vir ander polisielede. Ons polisiemanne en -vroue werk onder  baie
moeilike,  stresvolle  omstandighede  en  word  daagliks  gekonfronteer  met
lewensgevaarlike situasies.  Die  optrede  van  konstabel  Makutle  wys  dat
getalle alleen nie nodig  is  om  misdadigers  vas  te  vat  nie,  maar  dat
toewyding en die regte gesindheid 'n 26-jarige konstabel in staat  kon  stel
om 27 gevaarlike misdadigers na hulle selle terug te dwing.

Dit is polisielede van konstabel Makutle se kaliber wat  ons  in  staat  sal
stel om die stryd teen misdaad te wen, en ons  glo  dat  haar  optrede  haar
kollegas sal aanspoor om haar voorbeeld te volg. Ek dank u. (Translation  of
Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS (New NP): Speaker, the  brave  conduct  of  the  26-year-old
policewoman, constable Vanana Makutle, demands honourable  mention,  because
she not only endangered her own  life  when  she  apprehended  27  dangerous
criminals and forced them back to their cells when  they  tried  to  escape;
she also did it single-handed.

Too often we hear of corruption in the SAPS, as well as of  members  of  the
police who are facing criminal prosecution  themselves.  The  rotten  apples
must not be allowed to put the SAPS in a bad light.

Constable Makutle is an asset to the SAPS and her conduct  sets  an  example
to other members of the police. Our policemen  and  women  work  under  very
difficult, stressful conditions  and  are  confronted  daily  with  perilous
situations. The conduct of constable Makutle shows that  numbers  alone  are
not needed in order to clamp down on criminals, but that dedication and  the
correct attitude enabled a  26-year-old  constable  to  force  27  dangerous
criminals back to their cells.

It is members of the police of constable Makutle's calibre who  will  enable
us to win the fight against crime, and we  believe  that  her  conduct  will
encourage her colleagues to follow her example. I thank you.]

                     CORRUPTION IN MASTERS BUSINESS UNIT

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Thank  you,
Madam Speaker. Hon colleagues, in response to Mr Swart's statement, I  would
like to assure the House that when Mr Enver Daniels was  appointed,  he  set
in place an exhaustive string of controls within the Masters Business  Unit.
He first assessed the volumes of work, anticipating that the legislation  on
black and African estates would impact negatively on the  Masters'  Offices.
This has in fact not been so.

It was then an audit of work to be done and then  also  to  make  sure  that
controls were set in place to improve the way the work is done there.  Since
then Mr Daniels has set up  a  task  team  to  investigate  the  legislative
framework and also the response of the various role-players to  the  reforms
that  are  necessary.  In  fact,  last  week  he  had  a  meeting   of   150
representatives from the sector who approved  of  his  chosen  way  forward.
They broke themselves down  into  subcommittees  so  that  they  could  each
report on their special aspects of their work.

We remain confident that the measures that Mr Daniels has set in place  will
not  only  modernise  the  Masters  Business  Unit  itself,  but  will  also
contribute to a far more transparent way of working. We will not  anticipate
the decisions and conclusions of the commission that was set up to hear  the
events around the alleged Matola case and we will await  their  conclusions.
Mr Chichonga will be facing disciplinary  procedures,  not  because  of  his
allegations, but because of the way that he has brought the department  into
discredit and because of the way that he has performed in that  unit.  Thank
you.

         VOTING RIGHTS FOR SOUTH AFRICAN WHO ARE TEMPORARILY ABROAD

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Thank you very much, Madam  Speaker.  I
noted the comments which were  made  about  the  coming  amendments  to  the
Electoral Bill. I do want to say that you actually owe this to  the  FF  for
its constructive opposition, and the constructive role which it  is  playing
in the opposition. [Interjections.] Yes, yes, Mr Douglas Gibson. It  is  not
because of the DA that there is now this kind of agreement.  It  is  because
of the constructive intervention that was made by the  FF.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.] And yes, because of the majority party's commitment  to  nation-
building, to national consensus and to  national  reconciliation,  there  is
this amendment that is coming. We are committed to listening to what  people
have to say if they are sensible and if the  demands  they  are  making  are
sensible. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

                PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN AFRICAN PARLIAMENTS

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Thank you, Madam  Speaker.  I  think
that in noting the fact that Rwanda has made such  progress  on  the  gender
issue, it is important for us to understand that this is a country that  has
just recently experienced genocide.

However, the very fact that Rwanda could  have  democratic  elections  is  a
reflection of the role that South Africa has played in bringing about  peace
and stability in the Great Lakes region. It is unfortunate that  while  many
of our  country's  people  -  businesspeople,  politicians,  the  President,
Deputy President, members of other  parties  -  go  abroad  to  project  the
importance of South Africa, the DA consistently goes abroad to  put  forward
negative aspects of South Africa.

It is also significant that it is only the DA  that  tries  to  distort  the
reality of the President and Deputy President's visits abroad on  the  basis
that they are spending too much time out of the country. I hope that the  DA
will rise to the occasion and  begin  to  understand  and  have  a  national
interest and not a very limited interest, in trying  to  project  themselves
as  a  credible  political   opposition,   which   they   will   never   be.
[Interjections.]

                           ARRIVAL OF SAS AMATOLA

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam  Speaker,  I  would  first  of  all  like  to
welcome the observations by the hon Norman Middleton on the arrival  of  the
SAS Amatola. I take this opportunity to say  to  the  House  that  with  the
arrival of the SAS Amatola, in spite of the negative noises that  have  been
made around the country, South Africa's Navy has been  strengthened  and  it
is going to be strengthening as the programme is delivering this.

With a coastline of the size that we have and criminal  activities,  whether
it is the poaching of our marine resources or the entrance  of  drugs  along
our coast and so on, we feel we will now be in a position to deal  with  any
challenge that arises from that side.

I also would like to indicate to  the  House  that  I  will  be  issuing  an
invitation, in the next two days or so, when I will be going  to  visit  the
SAS Amatola. Also of course, it will be to place some of the members of  the
SA Navy who will be  manning  this  new  equipment.  I  would  be  happy  to
accommodate some of the members of the House who may be interested, so  that
they can be shown around and appreciate  what  capabilities  the  nation  is
acquiring. I thank you. [Applause.]

               PUBLIC KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you  very  much,  Madam  Speaker.
Hon Douglas  Gibson,  you  are  correct:  there  are  so  many  things  that
differentiate the two of us. Thank you very much for  saying  that  I  am  a
nice man. Of course I never agreed with the  former  member  of  Parliament,
the hon Jannie Momberg, when he said that "U is 'n suurpruim".  [You  are  a
sourpuss.] I never agreed with him on that. You are also a very nice man.

The other day, Madam Speaker,  I  had  a  lunch  hour  appointment  with  Mr
Gibson. Some members from this side of the House asked me if  I  was  making
any  progress  in  transforming  him   to   have   a   different   political
understanding of our agenda of democratisation.

I told them that, unfortunately,  my  sense  was  that  the  hon  member  is
incorrigible. We have been talking about crime  stats  in  this  House  -  I
don't know how many times - and I will explain what the situation  is  about
them. Of course, I have not given up, I am going to  try  to  use  the  next
decade to engage him on this particular question. The  fact  is,  there  are
many South Africans - I have a letter right now here on my desk  -  who  are
interacting with us on questions that relate to safety  and  security.  They
are within the commercial and financial sector,  organised  agriculture  and
so on.

All of them are discussing with us and making  contributions  in  regard  to
why we should deal with this  particular  matter.  As  we  will  understand,
there are some people in South Africa who are armchair critics, who  do  not
even understand what they  are  doing.  It  is  their  democratic  right  to
continue to do this and to display their  ignorance  to  the  broader  South
African public. The fact is that they do not want to come on board so  that,
as a united nation, we can deal with crime in this country.

Let them continue to do that. We are going to rely, in the  main,  on  those
people who are making a constructive  contribution  to  this  fight  against
crime. [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: The second issue  is  the  matter  that
I've also spoken about. I do want to commend the member of  Parliament  for,
once more, raising this matter. There are  many  policemen  and  policewomen
out there who are ready to lay down their own lives in order to ensure  that
our people, in the first instance themselves and  the  general  public,  are
safe from these criminals.

Last week in Durban two of six police members who were responding to a  tip-
off about a heist that was going to happen were ambushed. The  young  person
who was driving that vehicle ensured that he saved all of them. He kept  his
cool and displayed such heroism, firstly in ensuring  that  he  got  out  of
that situation and then in helping those who  were  involved.  It  was  only
later that he discovered that he himself had bullet wounds.

On a daily basis I find on my desk suggestions or commendations that  relate
to this type of heroism. And there are many police  officials  who  want  to
provide a good service for our people. Matters  that  relate  to  corruption
and other misdemeanors relate to only a few of these police officials,  some
of whom we are now charging. So in the end we are able to get  rid  of  such
elements within the SA Police Service. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

  CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF MEMBERSHIP TO THE
      STATUTES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR GENETIC ENGINEERING AND
                                BIOTECHNOLOGY

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Madam Speaker and hon members, on 7  March  this  year  the
Portfolio Committee on Arts, Culture,  Science  and  Technology  received  a
briefing from the Department of Science and Technology on  the  department's
intention to become  a  member  of  the  International  Centre  for  Genetic
Engineering and Biotechnology, ICGEB in short.

In line with the requirement of section  231(2)  of  the  Constitution,  the
department sought the approval of the committee to  join  the  organisation.
The committee agreed to this proposal that  South  Africa  should  join  the
ICGEB, and minutes of that meeting testify to this.

However, Parliament referred the proposal for consideration  and  report  by
the committee only on 25 September 2003. A meeting scheduled for 21  October
to adopt the report had to be postponed  due  to  the  cancellation  of  the
House sitting at that  time.  The  committee  met  again  this  morning,  11
November 2003, and formally adopted the report. It has  been  circulated  to
the members this afternoon.

The International Centre for Genetic Engineering  and  Biotechnology  is  an
international organisation dedicated to advance  research  and  training  in
molecular biology and biotechnology with special regard to the needs of  the
developing world. It is one  of  the  foremost  international  organisations
which  effectively  harness   science   and   technology   for   sustainable
development. It conducts  innovative  research  in  life  sciences  for  the
benefit of  developing  countries  and  through  training,  fellowships  and
funding programmes, provides advisory services on policy issues.

Further, its laboratories develop research of  importance  to  bioindustries
for its members. It promotes the  application  of  biotechnology  in  fields
such as health, energy, industrial production, nutrition  and  environmental
protection. The centre also offers consultation on programmes in areas  such
as plant biology,  crop  improvement,  human  health,  infectious  diseases,
vaccine production, molecular medicine and so on.

All members are required to participate  in  the  financing  of  the  centre
through a scale of assessment approved by the board. It  is  estimated  that
South Africa's assessed contribution would amount to US$37  000  per  annum.
Compared with the benefits South Africa  would  receive,  this  would  be  a
modest sum to part with.

The organisation was launched in 1983 in  Madrid,  Spain,  with  an  initial
membership of 26 countries, and by 2002  the  membership  had  grown  to  47
countries. South Africa applied for membership in November 2001.  The  ICGEB
board of governors  approved  South  Africa's  request  for  membership  but
indicated that, to become a full member, the Government of the  Republic  of
South Africa would have to declare its acceptance of the ICGEB statutes  and
indicate its commitment to the provisions contained therein.

South Africa was invited in November 2002 to participate as an  observer  in
the 9th session of the board of governors' meeting.  It  has  also  attended
meetings on various genetic engineering  and  biotechnology  issues  in  its
observer status. Such participation has enabled the  departmental  officials
and experts to develop a better  understanding  of  the  activities  of  the
centre and thus convinced the Department  of  Science  and  Technology  more
about the benefits for South Africa in joining the organisation.

Other benefits for South Africa would include opportunities for the  country
to further its national  biotechnology  strategy  through  participation  in
advanced  collaborative  research  programmes  and  comprehensive   training
schemes.  South  Africa  would  be  able  to   participate   in   high-level
intergovernmental forums  where  policy  issues  related  to  biosafety  and
technology transfer are addressed. Science councils dealing with  innovation
programmes in genetic engineering and biotechnology will benefit immensely.

There is also a possibility that South Africa  could  be  appointed  to  the
position of auditor for the ICGEB when it joins the organisation as  a  full
member. This would mean that the South African Auditor-General would  derive
significant benefits, experiencewise, from  securing  such  a  high  profile
international assignment. Also, the government of Italy,  in  a  partnership
through the World Summit on Sustainable Development,  WSSD,  have  committed
approximately R10 million for the establishment of  an  African  centre  for
infectious diseases in  South  Africa.  Such  a  centre  would  be  able  to
participate in the ICGEB activities as  an  affiliated  centre.  This  would
benefit not only South Africa but Africa  as  a  whole  and  thus  put  into
practice the principles of Nepad. But, this funding is conditional on  South
Africa finalising its membership of the  International  Centre  for  Genetic
Engineering and Biotechnology.

Therefore, in conclusion, the committee recommends that the House, in  terms
of section 231(2) of the  Constitution,  approves  the  said  membership.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Membership  to  the  Statutes  of  the  International  Centre  for   Genetic
Engineering and Biotechnology approved.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL
     GOVERNMENT ON TRADITIONAL LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK BILL

Ms E THABETHE: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Chief Whip  of  the  Majority
Party, I move that the report be adopted.

Motion  agreed  to  (Democratic   Alliance   and   Inkatha   Freedom   Party
dissenting).

Report accordingly adopted.

            TRADITIONAL LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK BILL
                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT:  Madam  Speaker,  and  hon
members, the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill  has  been
a long time in gestation. The many statutory bodies and  organisations  that
took part in the process of consultation  made  an  invaluable  contribution
towards bringing us to where  we  are  today.  I  wish  to  convey  my  deep
appreciation to all of them.

The  Bill  before  the  House  addresses  a  variety  of  issues,  including
provision of a national framework as well as norms and standards  that  will
inform and guide more detailed legislation  to  be  developed  by  provinces
dealing with the institution of traditional leadership and its role  in  the
government processes. It will also ensure the establishment and  structuring
of houses of traditional leaders within all  three  spheres  of  Government,
providing for transitional arrangements dealing, amongst other things,  with
the disestablishment of certain bodies.

The Bill also provides for the establishment of a commission on  traditional
leadership disputes and claims. Whilst the issues which are  raised  in  the
Bill may not be new, the manner in which they were  raised  and  dealt  with
confirms that ours is a society which is in a state of flux and change.  The
subject matter of this Bill, therefore, is lodged  within  the  calculus  of
state-society relations. The fact that it has taken us so long  to  come  to
this stage, and that our debates were sometimes acrimonious, speaks  of  the
complex dynamics of a society in transition. It is in this context  that  we
are having to pursue the true interrelated objectives  of  transforming  the
institution of  traditional  leadership  and  to  prompt  it  to  place  the
existential needs of the people at the centre of its concern.

Some who participated in the debate used the opportunity  to  remind  us  of
the bad  old  days  when  our  erstwhile  rulers  sought  to  bolster  their
exclusionary policies by asking South Africans  to  look  at  themselves  as
competing ethnic units. They used the opportunity to remind us that some  in
the institution connived with  the  apartheid  regime  to  deny  our  people
access to such basic rights as the right to organise, freedom of  expression
and liberty.

Of course, participants in the debates used  the  opportunity  to  make  the
point that the rights which our people were denied then  had  a  bearing  on
the  degree  to  which  citizens  could,  or  could  not,  access   critical
resources. They thus accused elements in  the  institution  of  having  been
complicit in spawning conditions of indigence  and  underdevelopment,  whose
legacy we are still battling to overcome.

Our Government has steadfastly  refused  to  allow  the  rancour  over  what
happened in the past to pose an  undue  obstacle  to  a  movement  into  the
future. After all, it was our own struggle for democracy which reshaped  the
boundaries of tribal identity and  brought  new  expressions  of  solidarity
amongst  our  people.  We  transformed  this  country  into  a  crucible  of
progressive relationships and changing identities.
As we all know, our country's Constitution reckons with the reality  of  the
existence of the institution of traditional leadership.  It  enjoins  us  to
construct relationships of  complimentarity  and  co-operation  between  the
institution of traditional leadership and democratically  instituted  organs
of state. We have resisted attempts by some who sought to pose the two in  a
competitive and antagonistic relationship. In this regard, we are guided  by
the abiding perspectives of the ANC, which in 1919  adopted  a  Constitution
creating a framework which allowed traditional  leaders  to  look  at  local
problems from the point of view of the  national  agenda  of  advancing  the
interests of the African majority.

At  the  time,  the  leadership  sought  to  prevent  the   institution   of
traditional leadership from being integrated into colonialism and  apartheid
schemes of the so-called African administration. The leadership also  sought
to assign traditional leaders a progressive role of designing practical  and
normative solutions to intertribal feuds and factions on the battlefields.
All progressive-minded South Africans  will  welcome  the  step  which  this
House is about to take, for they  understand  that  the  many  developmental
challenges that lie ahead can only be met by a  functionally  capable  state
which is supported in its endeavours by  all  social  formations,  including
the institution of traditional leadership. The goal of  uniting  our  people
behind the programme of sustainable  development  is  too  important  to  be
sacrificed on the altar of narrow party-political interests.

National Government departments have already started a  process  of  looking
at functional areas of Government in which co-operative  relationships  will
be forged between the institution of traditional leadership and  Government.
Local houses of traditional leadership will have to be established  so  that
they can join hands with district municipalities to  advance  the  cause  of
enhancing  levels  of  service  delivery   and   creating   conditions   for
sustainable development. We should not allow our focus to be  diverted  from
these goals by politicians who  may  have  estimated  that  their  political
fortunes turn on ethnic entrepreneurship. [Applause.]

With these few words, allow me once more to thank all those who  played  the
role in bringing this Bill to fruition. I lack  the  words  to  express  the
full measure of our Ministry and  department's  appreciation  for  the  role
played by Adv Seth Nthai and other members of the White Paper Task  Team.  I
also wish to extend a word of gratitude to the hon Yunus  Carrim  and  other
members of the portfolio committee for the dilligent manner  in  which  they
conducted the public hearings. I also wish to  thank  Inkosi  Simon  Gumede,
Inkosi Mwelo Nonkonyana, Mr S Phiri, Mayor Amos Masondo, MEC Gugile  Nkwinti
and MEC  Darkey  Africa  for  devoting  themselves  so  conscientiously  and
successfully to steering the National Coalition of Traditional  Leaders  and
the executive towards a working  consensus.  I  commend  this  Bill  to  the
House. [Applause.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Madam Speaker, I have heard Minister Asmal.  It's  Morena  in
my case, to be more realistic and less  provincialistic.  Deputy  President,
comrades and friends, the portfolio committee received a very wide range  of
submissions on the Traditional  Leadership  and  Governance  Framework  Bill
during public hearings. On the one hand,  sections  of  traditional  leaders
said to us that we should first  amend  the  Constitution  and  provide  for
traditional  authorities  to  have  the  same  powers  and  functions   that
municipalities have in the Constitution. That must first be  done  and  then
we should provide for legislation to give practical effect to that.

On  the  other  hand,  we  had  statutory   bodies,   NGOs   and   community
organisations who argued that the Bill  is  a  retreat  from  democracy  and
undermines the rights of women. In between these  organisations  there  were
others who welcomed the basic thrust of the Bill,  even  if  they  had  some
reservations.

The portfolio committee was challenged to find  consensus  among  this  wide
range of stakeholders  within  the  policies  of  our  respective  political
parties on traditional leadership. The ANC, of course, is a  broad  national
movement which includes  all  classes  and  strata  of  people.  Traditional
leaders and those who identify with them are also part of our  constituency.
We sought to address their needs in a way  that  is  reconcilable  with  the
needs of other sections of the ANC's constituency.

The portfolio committee's report on this Bill is carried in the  ATC  of  29
November.  I  will  briefly  offer  an  overview  of  it.  In  response   to
traditional leaders, the portfolio committee argued that  the  major  issues
in the White Paper and the Bill should be proceeded with. If at the  end  of
the process of taking the Bill through both Houses of  Parliament  there  is
significant consensus among traditional leaders,  the  SA  Local  Government
Association  and  other  key  stakeholders  that  there  is   a   need   for
constitutional  amendments,  the  parliamentary  committees  will   consider
proposing this to the executive and state that it also considers this.

In response to statutory  bodies,  NGOs  and  community  organisations,  the
portfolio committee pointed out that the role of traditional leadership,  as
the  Minister  said  a  moment  earlier,  is  reconcilable  with  the  basic
principles and values of our Constitution. After  all,  the  institution  of
traditional leadership is provided for in the  Constitution.  The  Bill,  in
fact, provides for the transformation  of  the  institution  of  traditional
leadership, so that it is consistent with the needs of  our  new  democracy.
But while customs and traditions are not static, they  have  a  momentum  of
their own. It  is  far  more  difficult  to  effect  transformation  through
legislation in the areas of custom and tradition than it is in  other  areas
of  society,  for  example  in  education,  the  economy  or  health   care.
Transformation in the areas of custom and tradition have  to  be  phased  in
appropriately.

Traditional leadership is a concurrent function of provincial  and  national
governments. Therefore, the  Bill  could  not  be  unduly  prescriptive.  It
seeks, as the Minister suggested, to provide a national framework and  norms
and standards, in terms of which  provincial  legislation  will  be  enacted
that will take into account provincial specifics. The Bill  deals  with  the
role and functions of traditional leadership in  governance  generally.  The
specific role and functions of traditional leadership  in  different  areas,
for example in customary justice, land administration and welfare,  will  be
dealt  with  by  the  respective  ministries,  departments   and   portfolio
committees.

The Bill does not specify any particular role for  traditional  leaders  and
land administration. However, shortly before the finalisation of  the  Bill,
the Communal Land Rights Bill was introduced  to  Parliament,  containing  a
new  clause  that  provides  for  traditional  councils  to  serve  as  land
administration committees. Several stakeholders - as I hope the Minister  of
Land Affairs and Agriculture is noting - have  raised  objections  with  the
portfolio committee to this role of traditional councils.

However, we have explained that we did not have  any  prior  knowledge  that
the  traditional  councils  would  serve  this  particular  role   in   this
particular way, as set out in the Communal Land Rights Bill.  We  appreciate
the concerns that stakeholders have raised, but  their  concerns  cannot  be
addressed in the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill.  They
will have to be dealt with in the Communal Land  Rights  Bill.  Accordingly,
we have referred them to the Portfolio Committee  on  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs and have also raised their concerns with  the  chairperson  of  that
committee.

All stakeholders need  to  appreciate  that  the  processing  of  this  Bill
represents  a  phase  in  the  ongoing  process  of  defining  the  role  of
traditional leaders in our new system of democratic governance. The Bill  is
a significant advance on the Bill brought to  Parliament  in  November  2000
and  which  was  not  proceeded  with.  Not  all  the  demands  of  all  the
stakeholders could be met in the  finalisation  of  the  current  Bill.  All
stakeholders had to compromise in this phase. This does not mean  that  they
cannot pursue their outstanding demands in future.

We think that the amendments to the Bill made  by  the  portfolio  committee
constitute  an  intricate  set  of  balances  of  the  demands  of  the  key
stakeholders. Essentially, they revolve around simultaneously enhancing  the
role of traditional leadership institutions and requiring them  to  be  more
transformative. This is reflected,  for  example,  in  providing  for  Bills
pertaining to customary law or customs to be first referred to the  National
House of Traditional Leaders for 30 days for its comments before  Parliament
can process them. But  we  have  also  provided  for  40%,  instead  of  the
original 25%, of  members  of  traditional  councils  to  be  democratically
elected and for a transitional period  for  existing  tribal  and  community
authorities to transform in order to be substantially reduced.

While  the  provisions  for  the  transformation  of  the   institution   of
traditional leadership so that it is consistent with  the  Constitution,  in
particular its democratic and gender  equality  aspects,  are  adequate  for
now, they may not be in future. Therefore, the Bill should be reviewed  over
time to take account of this. In particular, the issue  of  gender  equality
as it  applies  to  the  succession  of  traditional  leaders  needs  to  be
addressed further. This issue could not be  dealt  with  adequately  in  the
current Bill for a variety of reasons,  and  requires  further  consultation
with  traditional  leaders  and  other  key  stakeholders   before   further
regulation is provided for.

Obviously, the Khoisan communities  have  enormously  legitimate  claims  to
rights in terms of custom and tradition. But they have  specific  needs  and
interests  that  are  still  being  dealt  with  by  the  Ministry  and  the
department, and it was not possible  to  address  them  in  this  Bill.  Our
committee has constantly raised with the department  and  the  Ministry  the
concerns of the  Khoisan  communities.  While  there  is  progress  in  this
regard,  we  would  like  to  see  more  progress.  For  now,  the   Khoisan
communities have to be treated separately. Over time, there should  be  more
dialogue between the national House of Traditional Leaders and  the  Khoisan
council, and consideration should be given in the longer term  to  including
all sections of traditional leaders in one national structure.

The committee will continue to monitor progress relating to the concerns  of
the Khoisan communities as they apply to their rights  in  terms  of  custom
and tradition. The Khoisan council itself has come to terms  with  this  and
is appreciative of the inability of ourselves to process their concerns  for
now.

It  is  also  necessary  to  mention  that  the  committee  is  aware   that
traditional leaders and others see the  word  ``chief''  as  derogatory  and
find  it  unacceptable.  The  Ministry   and   department   proposed,   with
reservations, replacing the  word  ``chief''  with  ``principal  traditional
leader''. After  a  month's  discussion  with  the  portfolio  committee  we
finally  opted  for  the  term  ``senior  traditional  leader'',  with   the
understanding that the provincial legislation to be  enacted  will  use  the
applicable traditional terms, such as Inkosi, Kgoshi, Morena, etc.

Finally, it is necessary for me, on behalf of the committee, to express  our
appreciation to the many stakeholders who brought their concerns  before  us
at public hearings, and subsequently to  Mr  Zam  Titus  and  his  team  for
processing the Bill through our committee; to Adv Seth  Nthai,  the  special
adviser to the Ministry; to the director-general also, who  appeared  before
our committee to take this Bill forward; and to many  other  people  whom  I
haven't had the time to mention.

Obviously we appreciate the Minister and the Deputy Minister for  their  co-
operation. We extend our gratitude to Chris Sibanyoni, who  helped  us  with
research, as well as Annika Mokvist and Asanda Macanda. Our thanks  also  to
members of the committee for their expeditious processing of  the  Bill  and
for the assiduous consideration of all the  representations  made  by  civil
societies on this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Madam Speaker, in the general sphere and despite  what  has
already been said, this Second Reading debate on Traditional Leadership  and
Governance Framework Bill should not blind us to the  hard  reality  of  the
subject of traditional leaders and the traditional system of  governance  of
the indigenous peoples,  not  only  of  South  Africa  but  of  the  African
continent itself.

The institutions of traditional leadership and related  systems  stretch  as
far back in history as we can recall. Let me make this quite clear:  On  the
position of  the  DA  regarding  traditional  leadership  and  its  relevant
traditional institutions, we firmly believe  that  there  is  a  distinction
between the traditional system of government and the traditional leaders  as
individuals per se. The system, whilst it depends on the function and  roles
of traditional leaders, cannot and should not be  condemned  solely  on  the
malpractices of a few traditional leaders in the past or in the present.

The  DA  recognises  the  worth,  value  and   importance   of   traditional
institutions and leadership. These we firmly support on  the  basis  of  our
South African Constitution, with reference to Chapter 12. Having given  that
firm recognition, we are also  not  unmindful  of  the  realities  that  our
fledgling democracy has to face and deal with.

The conundrum facing  all  and  sundry  is  this:  How  to  democratise  and
modernise the institution for socioeconomic  development  without  political
imposition or  erosion  of  the  positive  and  essential  elements  of  the
traditional system which has sustained communities  and  helped  keep  their
social fibre intact over the ages? All this - within the  framework  of  the
democratic  Constitution  that  allows  for  our  diversity,  participation,
transparency and good governance to name but a  few  of  the  attributes  or
imperatives of our Constitution.

In crafting any Bill, room has to be  made  for  thorough  and  wide  public
participation, clarity and common understanding of the issues at stake,  and
not forgetting the maximum inclusion of all stakeholders  affected  by  such
processes. On quick perusal of the Bill, one can clearly  see  some  crucial
faults. For example, this Bill is clearly a hasty piece  of  work  aimed  at
beating some nebulous deadline, presumably set by the Government.

This seeming haste precludes some of our  traditional  communities  such  as
the Khoisan people - to use the current politically correct term. The  Bill,
therefore, misses the fact of our diverse indigenous communities. It is  all
quite clear that  not  enough  consultation  and  participation  have  taken
place. Could that  mean  that  the  ANC  Government  sees  the  question  of
traditional leadership and governance as a nuisance factor,  and  this  Bill
is merely an expedient political tool for Stalinist social  engineering  and
regimentation? If this is not the case, why  has  the  ANC  taken  10  years
without  amicably  settling  the  matter  of  traditional   leadership   and
traditional institutions, the very heart and  soul  of  the  large  part  of
South African population? Backtracking on promises  by  your  Government  is
counterproductive, Mister.

Within South  Africa's  nonracial,  nonsexist  and  democratic  Constitution
should lie some of the answers to the challenges facing our society. We,  in
the DA, believe that the Constitution is correct in recognising  traditional
leaders and the concomitant  role  of  traditional  leaders  in  our  modern
democracy. We cannot allow whatever legislative processes  to  pre-empt  the
sliding  away  into  insignificance  of  the  traditional   leadership   and
traditional institutions.

We do strongly believe that the rights of traditional leaders to  administer
customary law should continue  and  be  honoured.  Traditional  leaders  and
communities have to  be  consulted  thoroughly  and  involved  all  the  way
through. There cannot be a meaningful African Renaissance if we devalue  and
marginalise the very fundamental fabric of  the  African  soul  and  African
mosaic.  The  traditional  communities  must  play  a   critical   role   in
determining our common future as South Africans in Africa and the  world  at
large.

Last but not least, this Bill should really be withdrawn to  allow  all  and
sundry to go back to the drawing board to  consult  thoroughly,  debate  and
work towards an amicable outcome of the  final  product  responsive  to  the
realities of the very nature of the people, whilst not ignoring  the  modern
demands of a diverse, nonracial and nonsexist democracy.  Perhaps  I  should
remind you of what Basil Somhlahla cautioned:


  Do not do things for us, Mr Minister; let me  do  them.  Think  not  your
  thoughts for me; let me think them. You bore me with your  thoughts.  Who
  wants to be mothered? Show me the way; do not walk the  way  for  me.  My
  legs are strong and my head is not closed. Oh, please, I know my goal. Do
  not mother me.

Thank you. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order, hon members.

Inkosi M W HLENGWA: Hon Madam  Speaker  and  hon  members  of  the  National
Assembly, it is said that even an irreparably broken clock is right twice  a
day. Therefore, even  in  this  Bill  there  are  good  parts  such  as  the
provision which contemplates payment for junior traditional leaders such  as
headwomen and izinduna. However, with the exception  of  a  few  provisions,
this Bill is nothing short of a disaster for traditional leadership.

This Bill defines  the  powers  of  traditional  leadership.  From  a  legal
viewpoint, traditional leadership will only have the powers contemplated  in
this Bill, and  everything  not  contemplated  in  this  Bill  will  not  be
sanctioned by law and will virtually be illegal. This is  much  more  so  in
light of the fact  that  powers  exercised  since  time  immemorial  by  the
traditional leadership have now been ascribed by law to a variety of  organs
of state the primary of which are municipalities.

The powers given to the traditional leadership by  the  Bill  are  virtually
nonexistent and they almost smack of an insult to our intelligence.  If  one
goes  through  a  list  of  powers,  one  realises  that  what   traditional
leadership is empowered to do in terms of this Bill consists  of  activities
which any NGO could conduct without any enabling statutory  provision.  None
of the powers have  anything  to  do  with  the  governance  of  traditional
communities.  By  implication,  all  the   other   traditional   powers   of
traditional leadership have been excluded and, therefore, obliterated.

Moreover, this Bill  does  not  give  any  statutory  power  to  traditional
leaders but  only  to  traditional  councils.  Leaders  themselves  have  no
statutory power nor function in terms of the Bill. Traditional councils  are
given all the pseudopowers, which are faculties that traditional  leadership
could  exercise  without  any  enabling  legislation.  However,  one  really
wonders how these traditional councils will  ever  come  into  existence  as
they can only be constituted and established in terms of the Bill. In  order
for them to be constituted, 40% of their members will  need  to  be  elected
but there is no provision on how such elections  can  take  place  regarding
the  relevant  electoral  system  and  procedures,  and  who   carries   the
responsibility to organise and conduct such an election.

This shortcoming cannot be fixed because no  one  has  the  power  to  adopt
regulations to implement the Bill.  Therefore  traditional  councils  cannot
come into existence because  they  cannot  be  properly  constituted  as  no
election can be held in a manner which can be recognised  by  law.  This  is
particularly concerning as the same traditional  councils  are  supposed  to
carry responsibilities of land administration in terms of the Communal  Land
Rights  Bill,  which  may  lead  to  traditional  leadership   also   losing
additional powers of land administration.

The Bill is also a formula for disaster  where  it  tries  to  regulate  the
appointment of the traditional leadership  and  kings  by  giving  executive
responsibility for this function  to  royal  families.  A  royal  family  is
defined as all those who are relatives to the ruling  family.  However,  the
fact is that neither the royal family nor a ruling family  are  in  any  way
defined in a manner which can be  comprehensible  to  anyone.  There  is  no
clarity of how such  an  amorphous,  undetermined  and  uncertain  group  of
people who exercise this critically essential function  will  be  seized  by
matters, convene and exercise their decision-making, and  externalise  their
decisions.
The entire procedure is foreign to  our  traditions  and  will  subvert  our
customs, which have always placed great emphasis on  community  dynamics  in
respect of the selection and appointment  of  the  traditional  leader.  The
Bill is likely to give rise  to  great  conflicts  at  community  level  and
possible  bloodshed.  This  Bill  was  meant  to  be  the  response  of  our
Government to 10 years of negotiations  and  promises  made  to  traditional
leaders. In the end, the  pregnant  mountain  gave  birth  to  a  mouse  and
traditional leaders have ended up with nothing.

This Bill also interferes greatly with provincial autonomy and  purports  to
have an effect which may preclude provinces from giving traditional  leaders
more powers. It is  cast  in  the  constitutionally  erroneous  language  of
national legislation which enables provincial  legislation  on  the  matter,
rather than recognising that in terms of the Constitution provinces  have  a
plenary legislative power in the field. This shows the arrogance of  central
Government in trying to prevent that more  could  be  given  to  traditional
leaders by means of provincial legislation, which  also  augurs  poorly  for
the future as it opens the door to greater conflicts between  provinces  and
the national Government.

For these reasons, the IFP opposes this Bill and denounces it as one of  the
many breaches of the many promises made by the new  Government,  which  have
been  blatantly  dishonoured  as  if  honour  and  the  credibility  of  our
institution were never to be part and parcel  of  the  make-up  of  our  new
Republic. This should concern everyone, not only traditional leaders.

For those who attend funerals in dark suits: Get your suits  ready  as  this
Government is about to announce the date of the funeral of  the  institution
of traditional leadership. I thank you.

Mr J M NGUBENI: Madam Deputy Speaker, Deputy President, hon  members,  today
marks a landmark achievement  and  victory  for  our  young  democracy.  The
Constitution  recognises  the  institution  of  traditional  leaders,  their
status and role according to customary law and a traditional community  that
observes the system of customary law.

The Bill before the House today ensures that the institution of  traditional
leadership is transformed to be in harmony with  the  Constitution  and  the
Bill of Rights so that democratic governance and the values of an  open  and
democratic society are promoted.  The  Bill  also  promotes  freedom,  human
dignity and the achievement of equality and nonsexism.

The new system of local government in our country includes and covers  every
village,  town,  township,  rural  or  traditional  area.  This  legislation
equally  provides  partnership  between   municipalities   and   traditional
councils. The partnership is based on the principles of mutual  respect  and
recognition of the status and the role of the respective  institutions,  and
is guided by and based on the principle  of  co-operative  governance.  This
will eliminate contradictions and unnecessary competition because,  for  the
first time in our history, the role and  functions  of  traditional  leaders
and councils are explicitly defined. This is a process that complements  our
democratic values and processes.

This is a major achievement for the ANC. This, as always, is where  the  ANC
provides leadership in a responsible and sensible way for the  country,  the
continent and the world.  This  provides  and  accords  the  institution  of
traditional leadership a meaningful role in the modern times of democracy.

The issues confronting us today are neither new nor unique to the  ANC.  The
ANC, since its formation, has dealt with  these  issues  satisfactorily.  It
made sure that South Africans, both  black  and  white,  were  united  as  a
nation and that this institution was not narrowly used to  promote  politics
of tribalism and ethnicity.

To further illustrate this point, let us pause and look  at  the  amendments
of the constitution of the ANC in 1919, as proposed  in  the  fourth  annual
meeting of the ANC on 3 August 1915  in  Kroonstad.  These  amendments  were
later  adopted  in  Bloemfontein  on  2  January  1918.  Interestingly,  the
amendments specifically dealt with the institution of  traditional  leaders,
the recognition and status of the traditional leaders in the  ANC,  and  the
dispute resolution.

As we have indicated, these issues are neither new nor unique  to  the  ANC.
The  rich  history  of  the  ANC  bears  testimony  to  its   capacity   and
understanding in dealing with these delicate issues. Chief Albert  Luthuli's
statement in 1952, when the apartheid  government  dismissed  him  from  his
position as a chief for refusing to resign from the ANC,  also  demonstrates
the foresight of the ANC leadership. Allow me to quote from  that  statement
of Chief Luthuli:


  ... I would like to suggest that in the interest of  the  institution  of
  chieftainship in these modern times of democracy, the  government  should
  define more precisely and make more widely known  the  status,  functions
  and privileges of chiefs.

Today, this Bill does exactly what Chief Luthuli was pleading for,  some  51
years ago. The dispute resolution  and  commission  on  traditional  leaders
that will be appointed by the President, will precisely and decisively  deal
with the disputes and claims. It will also address the issue of  traditional
leaders  who  were  deposed  as  well  as  the  problem   of   nonhereditary
traditional leaders who were appointed  by  the  apartheid  regime  and  its
puppets in  the  homelands.  This  process  will  once  and  for  all  bring
legitimacy, respect and dignity to the institution that it deserves.

Through this Bill, the ANC has dealt convincingly with the  perception  that
leads to the portrayal of traditional  leaders  as  opposed  to  change  and
democracy and, in  some  instances,  leads  to  their  marginalisation.  For
instance, in Ghana,  the  constitution  recognises  traditional  leadership.
They have a role in issues of development, but  are  forbidden  to  actively
participate  in  politics.  In  Namibia,  the  constitution  provides   that
traditional leaders must pay allegiance to and accept the authority  of  the
modern state. The constitutions of Zimbabwe and Botswana provide for  houses
of traditional leaders respectively, but only at an advisory level.

This demonstrates that this Bill before Parliament  today  is  developmental
in nature. It further promotes nation-building and  is  very  innovative  in
dealing  with  these  complex  and  sensitive  issues.  The   ANC   provides
leadership in a responsible and sensitive way, at all times.

The question raised by the DP is very opportunistic. This process  has  gone
on for many years - from the White Paper and the status  quo  report.  Today
when we are told about consultation, it's very amazing. It means  they  were
sleeping  somewhere.  They  were  not  aware  of  what  was  happening.  The
opportunistic alliance today is prompting  people  to  start  talking  about
this question.  The  ANC  will  always  provide  leadership.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Deputy Speaker, when the process of negotiations  started
in South Africa after the unbanning of the liberation movements, one of  the
issues tabled for discussion was the role and status of traditional  leaders
and traditional leadership  institutions.  The  agreement  reached  in  this
regard was legislated upon in Chapter 11 of the 1993  interim  constitution.
All other outstanding issues were left to the processes  which  led  to  the
adoption of the Constitution of the Republic of South  Africa,  Act  108  of
1996. Section 211 of the Constitution provides that the institution,  status
and  role  of  traditional  leadership,  according  to  customary  law,  are
recognised, subject to the Constitution; and that  a  traditional  authority
that observes the system of  customary  law  may  function  subject  to  any
applicable legislation and customs, including amendments thereto.

This Bill defines the place and role  of  the  institution  within  the  new
system of democratic governance; transforms the  institution  in  accordance
with constitutional imperatives; and restores the integrity  and  legitimacy
of the institution of traditional leadership in  accordance  with  customary
law and practices.

On the one hand, there were traditional leaders who argued  that  this  Bill
should not be proceeded with. They held that the Constitution  should  first
be amended to give traditional leaders the  same  powers  and  functions  of
local government and that thereafter legislation had to be  passed  to  give
practical effect to this. On the other hand, there  were  statutory  bodies,
NGOs and community organisations that had reservations about  the  Bill  and
have argued that it is a retreat from democracy and serves to undermine  the
rights of women, amongst others.

The Bill therefore cannot be unduly prescriptive.  It  seeks,  in  fact,  to
provide a national framework and norms  and  standards  in  terms  of  which
provincial  legislation  will  be  enacted  that  will  take  into   account
provincial specifics.

Obviously, the  Khoisan  communities  have  enormous  legitimate  claims  to
rights in terms of custom and tradition. But, they have specific  needs  and
interests  that  are  still  being  dealt  with  by  the  Ministry  and  the
department as it was  not  possible  to  address  them  in  this  Bill.  Our
committee has constantly raised with the  department  the  concerns  of  the
Khoisan community. While there is progress in this regard, we would like  to
see some more progress.

I want to assess the role of  traditional  leaders  in  this  country.  Some
played a tremendous role in fighting colonial oppression. We  think  of  the
first political prisoner on Robben Island -  Autshumato  -  called  ``Harry,
die Strandloper'' by the Dutch. He was banished to Robben Island because  of
his opposition to Dutch rule and the oppression of the  Khoi  people.  There
were many others who were willing to die for the freedom  of  their  people.
But, there were also some who connived with  the  colonial  regimes  against
their own people and fellow traditional leaders.

Ten years ago a traditional leader  and  former  homeland  president,  Lucas
Mangope, formed a coalition with General Constand Viljoen,  an  ex-apartheid
military  strategist,  to  stop  the  democratic  transformation  that   the
majority of people of this country under the leadership of the ANC  and  the
NP wanted. Fortunately, they failed dismally. But,  in  that  process,  they
brought this country to the brink of civil  war  between  black  and  white.
[Applause.] They visited death, destruction and despair  on  the  people  of
the North West province.

Today, 10 years later, we see another senior traditional leader  and  former
homeland politician - Minister  Buthelezi,  and  former  apartheid  military
propagandist  -  the  hon  Tony  Leon,  once  again  forming  a   coalition.
[Applause.] They call it ``a coalition for change''. What is  it  that  they
want to change? Is it the democratic rule? Is it the building of  more  than
a million houses? Is it the black economic empowerment against which the  DA
voted? Is it the Constitution  that  guarantees  the  rights  of  black  and
white?

What did Carl Werth, the former regional chairperson of the  DA  and  former
High Commissioner to Singapore say about this alliance? It was  built  on  a
platform of treachery;  it  is  the  right-wing  party  that  is  inexorably
becoming more  authoritarian;  it  prescribes  ethics  and  morals  for  the
Government but does not apply the same standards to its own activities;  it,
in fact, meant fighting black with their ``fight back''  campaign  and  that
its   black   public   representatives   were   nothing   more   than    ...
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Are you rising on a point of order, hon member?

Mr R S NTULI: Will the hon member take a question?

Mr J DURAND: I will gladly  take  a  question  at  the  end  of  my  speech.
[Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Proceed, hon member.

Mr J DURAND: It, in fact, meant fighting black  with  their  ``fight  back''
campaign and that their black public representatives were nothing more  than
window-dressing. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Deputy Speaker, I understand that there is a rule  of
this House which relates to relevance.  What  is  under  discussion  at  the
moment is a draft Bill before us, but the hon member is  talking  about  the
last election campaign and the one before that. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Gibson, please take your  seat  and  let  the
hon member finish his speech.

Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Another thing,  by  often  using  the
``k'' word, it has sacrificed liberal  democracy  on  the  altar  of  Leon's
ambition. The DA, as a liberal democratic  party,  is  totally  against  the
creation of the institution of traditional leaders. I wonder  how  they  are
going to vote.

In the run-up to the 1999 election, the DA leader  promised  his  right-wing
electorate that he would take their streets back - Ons sal die strate  terug
vat! Take the streets back from whom? From blacks  who  now  own  houses  in
previously white suburbs? From black children who now walk  the  streets  to
previously white schools? [Time expired.] I thank you. [Applause.]

USEKELA-MPHATHISWA  WOORHULUMENTE  BAMAPHONDO   NABEKHAYA:   Sekela-Somlomo,
baphathiswa noosekela-baphathiswa,  malungu  abekekileyo  ale  Ndlu  yoWiso-
mthetho,  kulo  nyaka  uzayo,  kwinyanga  kaTshazimpuzi,  siza   kubhiyozela
iminyaka  elishumi  sikhululekile  kweli  lizwe.  Sikhululeke  kwimpatho-mbi
nengcinezelo  phantsi  kwenkqubo  yacalucalulo  yorhulumente  wangaphambili.
Simele ukuba sithi halala kwi-ANC ngokuba siyayibona  indlela  eya  eKanana,
ilizwe lobusi nobisi.

Kananjalo iinkosi zethu  zomthonyama  zeli  lizwe  loMzantsi  Afrika  zimele
ukuba namhlanje zithi halala kulo mbutho  wethu  i-ANC  ongenamona,  owaqula
walingangatha esilwa notshaba olwabangela ukuba  kubekho  umsantsa  phakathi
kwabantu beli lizwe neenkosi zabo zomthonyama; utshaba olwalusaziwa  ngokuba
yi-apartheid.

Mna andithethi  ngabaa  bantu  bakhethe  ukuthengisa  isizwe  ngenxa  yokuba
belahlekiswa   ngamanyepha;   abantu   ababekwa    ezikhundleni    zobukhosi
ngurhulumente wocalucalulo kodwa besazi ukuba  ngokomnombo  abazizo  iinkosi
zomthonyama.  Basekho  ke   nanamhlanje   abantu   abanjalo.   Ngabo   ngoku
abatshotsha  phambili  kulo  mbuso  walo  rhulumente  wethu,  phofu  obabeke
endaweni ebanzi. Babesitya phantsi korhulumente wengcinezelo thina  silamba,
kanti nangoku basafuna ukutya bodwa phantsi kolu lawulo lwentando  yesininzi
yabantu beli lizwe. Hayi masibayeke oohlohlesakhe, amalulwane anganenyani.

Kukhe kwaphantsa ukuba kubi phakathi  kukaRhulumente  wethu  neenkosi  zethu
ngenxa yoofunzeweni. Njengoko nisazi, kudala  lo  mcimbi  weenkosi  uphethwe
malunga nokuba iyini na indima yazo kulo  mbuso  wethu  wentando  yabantu  -
idemokhrasi - apho wonke ummi  weli  lizwe  athabatha  inxaxheba  kwiinkqubo
zolawulo lweli lizwe.  Besingathini  thina  ukuzivalela  ngaphandle  iinkosi
zethu kule ndima?

Sanqanda amanzi  engena  endlwini  ngonyaka  ka-2000,  sekucaca  ukuba  kuza
kuqhawuka kuhlangana. Phofu iinkosi  zomthonyama  zona  zazithe  tu,  cwaka,
njengoko  zaziyazi  into  yokuba   le   nkqubo   ilandelwa   yi-ANC   yileyo
yayingumbono   wabazali   nookhokho   bazo,    iinkosi    zethu    zamandulo
ezaziyinxalenye yokusekwa kwalo mbutho wethu iANC. Uvela phi ndiye ke wena?

Ngeli xesha thina sizama  ukusondelelana  neenkosi  zethu  njengoRhulumente,
kukho aba zungul' ichele kuthiwa ziintatheli okanye oonondaba  abathe  gqolo
ukuphemba umlilo weyantlukwano. Akukho nto bekulalwa kutyiwe yona  apho  aba
nondaba babehlangene khona noMongameli Mbeki okanye  noMphathiswa  uMufamadi
ngaphandle  kokubuza  ngomcimbi  wokulawula   kweenkosi   kwizithili   zazo.
Ngamanye amathuba uMongameli  ebedudulelwa  ukuba  avume  ukuguqula  uMgaqo-
siseko weli lizwe  ukuze  alungiselele  iinkosi  zibe  nelungelo  lokulawula
njengoomasipala.

Mandiphinde ndiyigxininise into ethi  imbono  yethu  bantu  asiyiyo  eyokuba
makubekho inqanaba lolawulo lesine ekuthiwa lelobukhosi. Amanqanaba  olawulo
mathathu kuphela; lelikazwelonke, lelamaphondo, ze ibe leloomasipala.

Kwisahluko 12 kuMgaqo-siseko wethu kuthethwa  ngendima  yobukhosi  kwinkqubo
yolawulo lwesizwe. Qwaba!  Hayi  ukuba  ubukhosi  bube  lelinye  lamanqanaba
olawulo.  Kambe  safumanisa  ukuba  ngenxa  yeengxoxo  eziphuhlileyo  esathi
sanazo kunye neenkosi,  sathi  saqondana  sade  savumelana  ngeminye  imiba,
zibuye zingxengwe ngoonondaba kuthiwe lo  Rhulumente  uyawaxutha  amalungelo
eenkosi.

Ngoko   senza   umbulelo   ongazenzisiyo   kwiinkosi    zethu    zomthonyama
ngentsebenziswano ukuza kuthi ga  ngoku.  Ewe,  kubekho  ukungaqondani  apha
naphaya,   kodwa   njengabantu   abanqwenela   inkqubela-phambili,    abantu
abanothando noxolo, siye savumelana ngengxam yalo Mthetho uYilwayo  umalunga
nobukhosi kwanolawulo.

Kwakhona, senza isicelo kwiinkosi zethu  ukuba  zizame  ngalo  lonke  ixesha
ukuyicikida le mimoya igqubayo kwanokuba ngaba  iyasakha  na  isizwe  okanye
iphezu kokuchitha-chitha isizwe sethu ukuze sibuyele  emva  sibe  ziintsalu.
Thina singuRhulumente kunye neenkosi zomthonyama - ndiyayiphinda le ndawo  -
sisebenzela ukumanya uluntu lwaseMzantsi Afrika,  ukuze  sibuyisele  isidima
sesizwe sethu, siphelise tu  ucalucalulo  ngokwebala  nangokwesini;  kubekho
ulawulo lwentando yabantu; sihlalisane ngokuthobelana nangoxolo.  Siyathemba
ukuba namhlanje  le  ndaba  icacile  eluntwini.  Halala  kwiinkokeli  zethu!
Halala!

AMALUNGU ABEKEKILEYO: Halala!

Kwinkomfa ye-ANC  yangonyaka  ka-1997  eMafikeng,  neyalo  nyaka  uphelileyo
eStellenbosch, kwamkelwa izindululo  zokuba,  ewe,  ubukhosi  bunayo  indima
enkulu kwinkqubo yolawulo, yaye iinkosi  zinoxanduva  lokulondoloza  amasiko
nezithethe    zethu    kwanokukhuthaza    umanyano    kwakunye    nophuhliso
olungagungqiyo kwiziphaluka zobukhosi.

Siyakuqaphela ukuba ngalo lonke ixesha i-ANC ithe gqolo  ukukhuthaza  abantu
ukuba  bahlonele  ubukhosi.  Kuyaqala  kulo  mbuso  ukhokelwa  yi-ANC  ukuba
bunikwe  ingqwalasela  ubukhosi,  kuthethwa-thethwane   neenkosi   ngenjongo
yokubuyisela isidima sobukhosi.

Kulo nyaka nje uMongameli uThabo Mbeki udibene neenkosi  kabini  ubuncinane;
ngomhla wokuqala  kwinyanga  kaTshazimpuzi  xa  kwakuvulwa  iNdlu  yeeNkosi,
ziqala unyaka  -  ngolu  hlobo  nathi  sivula  ngalo  iPalamente.  Wayelapho
uMongameli yaye watsho ngodlwabevu lwentetho. Waba nendawo  awayigxininisayo
esithi:


  I am certain that we all agree that we have a common  duty  to  pull  our
  people out of the morass of poverty and disease; that our primary  desire
  is to defeat underdevelopment and ensure that  together  we  move  faster
  towards the achievement of the goal of a better life for all.

Kodwa  ke  intetho  yakhe  ayizange  ixoxwe  ngaloo  mini.  Ngomhla  wama-30
kwinyanga yeKhala, kwakhona  iNdlu  yeeNkosi  yamema  uMongameli  ukuba  aze
kumamela ingxoxo malunga nentetho yakhe ngexesha yayivulwa indlu.  Yancumisa
ingxoxo  ngaloo  mini  kuba  eyona  nto   yayingundoqo   kuninzi   lweenkosi
ezathabatha inxaxheba yayikukuba zithathe  inxaxheba  kwiinkqubo  zophuhliso
zikaRhulumente kwiindawo ezihlala kuzo;  kubekho  iindyebo  zoqoqosho  ukuze
abantu  bafumane  imisebenzi  bakwazi  ukugxotha  ikati  eziko.   UMongameli
waphendula egxininisa kwelokuba  into  ebalulekileyo  emaphandleni  kukulima
nokufuya.

NgeCawa  le  idlulileyo  besihambele   kwikomkhulu   labaThembu   baseRhode,
eQamata, kunye noSekela-Mongameli, uQabane uZuma. Angatsho naye athi  khange
sixoxe chuku phaya. Into  ethethiweyo  phaya  nguKumkani  uZwelenkosi  kunye
neNkosi uNgangomhlaba bakwaMatanzima kukuba bona  bafuna  iiteletele  balime
qha. Nantso ke esiyifunayo thina singuRhulumente.

Malunga nokuguqulwa koMgaqo-siseko, uMongameli wathi - mamelani  ke  kakuhle
torho kweli cala - :

I must say, in that context, that indeed, if it  becomes  clear  from  those
processes that out of our discussion on both the White Paper and  the  draft
legislation, it is necessary to make constitutional amendments to make  sure
that the matters we visualise are actually done. Yes,  indeed,  we  will  do
the constitutional amendments. It has to come out of what it is that we  are
trying to achieve. And I'm saying that if out of the processes in which  we,
all of us, are involved, the necessity becomes clear that we must  do  those
constitutional amendments. Of course, we must do them. But, let us see  what
comes out of that process.

Ikhona  ke  kambe  imicimbi  ekusafuneka  iqwalaselwe   kanobom   bubukhosi,
ngakumbi le  ndima  yoomama  ebukhosini.  Siyawuncoma  lo  Mthetho  uYilwayo
siwuxoxa kule Ndlu namhlanje, kuba  uyazama  ukukhawulelana  noMgaqo-siseko.
Indima yoomama, naxa ingekatsoli nje, ifumana ingqwalasela. Kambe  singafane
nje siqulunqe le mithetho, ukuba imo yobukhosi ayiguquki ukuze  ilungelelane
noMgaqo-siseko weli lizwe,  akukazi  kulunga.  Kufuneka  ubukhosi  buyamkele
into  yokuba  kweli  lizwe  akuvumelekanga  ukucalucalula  ngokwesini.  Side
sawisa umthetho ngoyaka ka-2000 obizwa ngokuba yi-Promotion of Equality  and
Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act. Lo  mthetho  sisiseko  sedemokhrasi
kweli lizwe.
Sinelungu ke apha ePalamente elingumama, uNkskz  uShilubana  ohlala  kweliya
cala, elisamhokamhokana  nodaba  lokuba  libekwe  njengenkosi  yamaShangana-
Tsonga   kugunyaziwe   wakwaBaloyi,   eLimpopo.   Uselungelweni    lokubekwa
njengenkosi ``in  her  own  right'',  kodwa  kuba  engumama  amadoda  athile
ayabubanga obo bukhosi. Phofu ke siseza kugagana!

Imithetho  echaphazela  ukubekwa  koomama  ebukhosini   kwakunye   nelungelo
loomama   lokuba   babe   nemihlaba,   njalonjalo,   kufuneka    iqwalaselwe
ngokukhawuleza.

Xa siphethe le nkqubo yophuhliso emaphandleni, iinkosi  azinakho  ukubashiya
ngasemva oomama. Oomama kufuneka babe nenxaxheba enkulu kolu  phuhliso  kuba
ngumama intsika yekhaya; nguye ojongene nempilo yosapho. Ngaphandle  koomama
abukho ubomi obungcono.

Thina singuRhulumente kwakunye ne-ANC sibuxabisile ubukhosi yaye  sizimisele
ukusebenzisana nobukhosi  ukuze  ilizwe  lethu  libe  nempumelelo,  limomoze
yindyebo, baxhamle bonke abantu kunye nezizukulwana zethu.

Inene iminqweno yeekumkani neenkosi zethu zamandulo iyafezekiswa  namhlanje.
Ookumkani  uShaka,  ooMakhado,  ooSekhukhune,  ooSabatha  Dalindyebo   kunye
noNkosi Albert Luthuli,  njalonjalo,  baxolile  apho  bakhoyo.  Ndiyabulela.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[The DEPUTY MINISTER OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HOME AFFAIRS:  Deputy  Speaker,
Ministers and Deputy Ministers, members of the  constitutional  House,  next
year, in April, we are going to celebrate our ten years of freedom  in  this
country. Free from hatred and oppression under apartheid government. We  are
supposed to congratulate the ANC because we can see the way to  Canaan,  the
land of milk and honey.

That also goes for our traditional leaders in South Africa. Today  they  are
supposed to say congratulations  to  our  ANC  organisation,  which  is  not
jealous,  and  which  fought  strongly  against  its  enemies  that   caused
segregation among the people and traditional leaders of  this  country.  The
enemy was known as apartheid.
I don't talk about those people who chose to  sell  their  land  because  of
being deceived by whites or those people who were appointed  as  leaders  by
the apartheid government but  who  knew  that  historically  they  were  not
traditional leaders. We still have people like that. They are the  ones  who
are now at the forefront in this freedom of our government,  and  they  have
been in a narrow  place.  Their  stomachs  were  full  under  the  apartheid
government whereas ours were empty. Even now they still want to  fill  their
stomachs under this democracy in this country. Let us leave alone those  who
take care of themselves, the bats who do not have the truth.

Things nearly became bad between our Government and our traditional  leaders
because of whites. As you know, the issue of traditional  leaders  has  been
handled too long in the case of  their  role  in  this  people's  democracy,
where all citizens  take  part  in  the  constitutional  programme  of  this
country. How can we exclude our traditional leaders from this role?

It was very bad in the year 2000; it was clear that anything  could  happen.
The traditional leaders said nothing, they were  quiet,  whereas  they  knew
that the programme  followed  by  the  ANC  was  their  parents'  and  their
forefathers' dream. Our late traditional leaders were  together  in  forming
our ANC organisation. Where do you come from so that I can go as well?

Whenever we are trying to be close to  our  traditional  leaders,  like  the
Government, there are people who sniff out the news  called  journalists  or
news-takers who always like to cause segregation.  There  was  nothing  else
but news to them whenever they met President  Mbeki  or  Minister  Mufumadi;
their question was only based on  the  issue  of  the  rule  of  traditional
leaders.  At  times  the  President  was  pushed  to  agree  to  change  the
constitution of this country so that he could  prepare  traditional  leaders
to have rights of ruling as in the case of municipalities.

I must  stress  again  that  our  vision  is  not  to  have  four  types  of
government. We only have three types  of  government,  which  are  national,
provincial and municipal government.

Chapter 12 of our Constitutional talks about the chieftainship role  in  the
programme of governing the nation. Only that!  Not  that  the  chieftainship
role should be one of ruling government. We found out that because  of  some
debate that we had with our  chiefs,  we  realised  and  agreed  with  other
things, but the journalists exaggerate it, claiming that the  government  is
taking away chiefs' rights.

We are thanking our chiefs for their co-operation until now. Yes,  we  agree
that there were some misunderstandings here and there, but like  people  who
wish to proceed, people with peace and love, we agreed because of  this  new
Constitution, which is about chieftainship and governing.

Again we are making a plea to our chiefs that they must try by all means  to
fight this bad spirit that is around and see  whether  it  is  building  our
nation or whether it is out to destroy our nation so that we  move  backward
and are divided. We as Government and traditional leaders - I  am  repeating
this - we are working to unite the people of South Africa, so  that  we  can
bring  back  our  country's  dignity.  We  must  stop  racial   and   gender
discrimination, promoting  only  the  democracy  of  people;  we  must  stay
faithful and peaceful. We are sure today  that  this  is  clear  to  people.
Congratulations to our leaders! Congratulations!

HON MEMBERS: Congratulations!

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT  AND  HOME  AFFAIRS:  At  the  ANC
Conference that was held in Mafikeng in 1997  and  at  last  year's  one  in
Stellenbosch, we welcomed the proposal that  traditional  leadership  had  a
big role  in  the  ruling  programme  and  the  traditional  leaders  had  a
responsibility to look after our customs and norms and  to  encourage  unity
and  also  the  development  that  is  rigid  in  different  directions   of
chieftainship.

We notice that  the  ANC  is  continuing  to  encourage  people  to  respect
traditional leadership. This is the first time in  this  Government  led  by
the ANC that traditional leadership is being given recognition. It is  being
negotiated with the chiefs, the purpose being  to  restore  the  dignity  of
traditional leadership.

This year alone, the President, Thabo Mbeki, has met with the chiefs  twice.
On 1 April, when there was an opening of the House of  Traditional  Leaders,
they began a year like we do here in Parliament.  The  President  was  there
and he made a wonderful speech. His emphasis was on this:


  I am certain that we all agree that we have a common  duty  to  pull  our
  people out of the morass of poverty and disease; that our primary  desire
  is to defeat underdevelopment and ensure that  together  we  move  faster
  towards the achievement of the goal of a better life for all.

But his speech was not debated on  that  day.  On  30  July,  the  House  of
Traditional Leaders again invited the President to  listen  to  the  debates
concerning the speech he made at the opening. The discussions  of  that  day
were  great;  the  main  focus  of  most  of  the  traditional  leaders  who
participated there was to take part  and  be  involved  in  the  development
programmes of the Government in  their  places.  There  should  be  economic
wealth so that people can be employed  so  as  to  chase  away  hunger.  The
President's response emphasised the fact  that  what  is  important  in  the
rural areas is to plough and to look after livestock.

Last Sunday we visited the Kingdom of the Thembus of Rhode  at  Qamata  with
the Deputy President, Comrade Zuma. He will tell you that we never have  any
fuss there. What King Zwelenkosi and King Ngangomhlaba of Matanzima said  is
that they  need  tractors  so  that  they  can  plough.  That  is  what  the
Government wants.

In  terms  of  changing  the  Constitution,  the  President  said  -  listen
carefully to this:


  I must say, in that context, that indeed, if it becomes clear from  those
  processes that out of our discussion on both  the  White  Paper  and  the
  draft legislation, it is necessary to make constitutional  amendments  to
  make sure that the matters we visualise are actually done,  yes,  indeed,
  we will do the constitutional amendments. It has to come out of  what  it
  is that we are trying to achieve. And I am saying  that  if  out  of  the
  processes in which we, all of us, are  involved,  the  necessity  becomes
  clear that we must do those constitutional amendments, of course, we must
  do them. But, let us see what comes out of that process.

There  are  matters  that  need  to  be  noted  by  traditional  leadership,
especially  the  role  of  women   in   traditional   leadership.   We   are
complementing this legislation that is being discussed in this House  today,
because it is trying to meet up with the Constitution. As  to  the  role  of
women, although it is not yet direct, we are looking at it.  We  can  create
these laws if the situation of the traditional leadership  does  not  change
and goes along with the Constitution of this country;  therefore,  there  is
nothing  that  would  be  right  yet.  It  is  necessary  that   traditional
leadership accept the fact  that  in  this  country  discrimination  against
gender is not allowed. We even passed a law in the year 2000  known  as  the
Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act. This  law
is the basis of democracy in this country.

We have a member of Parliament who is a woman, Ms Shilubana  on  that  side,
who is still struggling with the issue of being  crowned  as  the  Chief  of
Shangana-Tsonga authorised by Baloyi in Limpopo. She has  the  right  to  be
crowned as the traditional leader, in her own right, but because  she  is  a
woman, certain men claimed that traditional  leadership.  But  we  will  see
about that!

The laws that involve the crowning of women in  traditional  leadership  and
the right of women to own land, etc, need to be  looked  at  with  immediate
effect.

When  we  handle  this  development  programme  in  the  rural  areas,   the
traditional leaders cannot leave women behind. Women  need  to  play  a  big
role in development because a mother is a pillar of the home, and it is  she
who takes care of the family. There is no better life without a mother.
We  as  the  Government,  together  with  the  ANC,  value  the  traditional
leadership. We intend to work with them in order to  have  progress  in  our
country; a flowery  treasure  which  everybody  will  enjoy,  including  our
generation.

Indeed, the wishes of our late kings  and  chiefs  are  accomplished  today.
King Shaka,  Makhado,  Sekhukhune,  Sabatha,  Dalindyebo  and  Chief  Albert
Luthuli, etc, are happy where they are. I thank you! [Applause.]]

Ms M C LOBE: Madam Speaker, comrades and friends, as  we  move  towards  the
end of the first decade of freedom and democracy, we are  charged  with  the
responsibility of defining the role and function of  traditional  leadership
in governance, thereby giving more  expression  to  the  ideas  set  out  in
Chapter 12 of the Constitution.

One of the great challenges in relation to the  institution  of  traditional
leadership and the customs governing it is, of  course,  the  gender  issue.
The customs  guiding  the  institution  are  often  seen  as  discriminating
against women in terms of decision-making, property ownership,  inheritance,
etc. My point of  departure  is  therefore  that  customs  are  not  static.
Customs constantly evolve with the changes in society and the needs  of  the
people.

These  transformative  forces   should   be   harnessed   in   our   greater
transformation of society. To achieve that, there must be  guidance  as  our
society demands that whatever changes occur must be in line  with  the  Bill
of Rights in the Constitution. Thus the preamble to this Bill states that -


  ... the institution of traditional leadership must be transformed  to  be
  in harmony  with  the  Constitution  and  the  Bill  of  Rights  so  that
  democratic governance and the values of an open  and  democratic  society
  may be promoted ...

and gender equality within the institution of traditional leadership may  be
progressively advanced.

Likewise, the preamble requires the institution of traditional leadership  -



  ... to promote freedom, human dignity and the achievement of equality and
  nonsexism ...

While changing a custom is the most challenging task and not  the  task  for
legislators alone, this Bill contributes towards our overall  transformation
of society. If the institution is to make a meaningful contribution  to  the
lives of our people, to the governance of the people and to the  development
of communities it must allow women to participate fully because ...

... Ka Sesotho re re mmangwana o tshwara thipa ka bohaleng. [... in  Sesotho
we believe that a woman will do whatever it takes to protect her own.]

Thus  the  portfolio  committee  amended  clause  2(3),  which  empowers   a
traditional community to transform  and  adapt  customary  law  and  customs
relevant to the Bill so as to comply with the relevant principles  contained
in the Bill of  Rights  in  the  Constitution  by,  one,  preventing  unfair
discrimination;  and,  two,  seeking   to   progressively   advance   gender
representation in the succession of traditional leadership positions.

With specific regard to women's  participation  in  decision-making  bodies,
the Bill seeks to achieve increased representation of women  on  traditional
councils. While 40% of the members are elected for a period  of  five  years
and 60% selected by the traditional leader in a manner consistent  with  the
custom of the community, the overall requirement is  that  women  constitute
at least one third of members.

Only in exceptional circumstances  can  the  Premier  exempt  a  traditional
council from this provision. The transition period granted  for  traditional
councils to comply with this provision  has  also  been  reduced  from  four
years to one year.

Phephetso e kgolo mabapi le tsamaiso ya boetapele  ba  borena,  ke  ho  etsa
bonnete ba hore e tsamaisana le molao  wa  motheho,  haholo-holo  karolo  ya

ho ke ke ha eba le  tshitiso  ya  letho  ka  lebaka  la  bongata  ba  basadi

basadi boetapeleng ba borena. Ke mona moo mosotho a reng monokotshwai  ha  o
ke o butswe ho latela takatso ya tshwene. (Translation of  Sotho  paragraphs
follows.)

[The biggest challenge in the governing of the  traditional  council  is  to
make sure that it complies with the Constitution, especially the  part  that
deals with human rights. The most important issue here is the  hierarchy  of
leadership in the traditional council. According to the  department  of  the
provincial governments, women only make up six per cent of  the  traditional
councils. Most of these women are those who are just temporarily  acting  on
behalf of their sons who are still too young to hold those positions.

This is the biggest challenge in  implementing  the  requirement  that  says
women should constitute at least one third  in  the  traditional  leadership
positions. In some districts there  won't  be  any  problems  as  there  are
larger numbers of women in the  traditional  councils.  In  other  districts
there will be no women representatives because there are  no  women  in  the
leadership positions. This shows that things  do  not  happen  according  to
one's desires.]

For the time being, we have therefore settled  on  the  formulation  that  a
sufficient  number  of  women  be  elected  to  make  the  local  House   of
Traditional Leaders representative of traditional leaders in the  area.  The
Bill seeks to achieve change  progressively  so  as  to  increasingly  allow
women to become traditional leaders in their  own  right.  In  future  these
provisions may have to be revisited.
The immediate  ambition  of  this  Bill  is  to  see  women  represented  on
traditional councils within a year of the commencement of this Act,  and  to
see traditional communities working to bring  customs  and  traditions  into
line with the Constitution.

Molao ona o nka  mehato  e  hlokolosi  mabapi  le  dikamano  tsa  botona  le

hore ho ya ka rona ... (Translation of Sotho paragraph follows.)

[This  Act  takes  important  steps  in  ensuring  gender  equality  in  the
traditional leadership council. It also demonstrates that wherever  she  is,
a woman can work to the best of her ability. For example, I  would  like  to
remind you of the Rain Queen in the Limpopo province, known by the  name  of
Queen Modjadji, about whom we all know that ...]

... she is more like an icon.

Mme empa ka ntle ho moo, mane provenseng ya Foreistata, ho na le  Mofumahadi
eo ho thweng ke Mofumahadi  Mmathokwana  Mopeli  eo  eleng  hore  ho  latela

hlokahala hore a etswe emong wa bo majoro ba rona ba mabatowa a  Foreistata.
(Translation of Sotho paragraph follows.)

[Again, in the Free  State  province,  we  also  have  a  woman  called  Mrs
Mathokwana Mopeli, whom, because of the wonderful work  she  is  doing,  the
ANC decided to make one of the mayors in the districts of the Free State.]
While the provisions for gender equality are adequate for now, they may  not
be so in the future. Over time we will need to review the Bill, but for  now
the main  challenge  is  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  existing
provisions in the Bill on gender equality. This  is  something  that  should
not be left to the department alone, because as MPs we should  also  play  a
role - and not just us but civil society as a whole because it has  a  major
responsibility in this regard. Let  us  all  work  together  to  ensure  the
transformation of the institution of traditional leadership.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  ACDP  supports  the  traditional
system of Government and the institution.  We  do  so  not  because  we  are
nearing the elections, but because we  share  fundamental  values  with  the
system. Together, we believe and  promote  the  traditional  family  values,
culture, social coherence and national identity.

With regard to governance, we believe  that  the  institution  is  the  best
system of  municipal  government  in  rural  areas.  We  disagree  with  the
institution though in some  respects,  for  example  where  the  institution
denies women the right to succession of property. When  the  institution  is
intact we shall hear little  of  crime  in  rural  areas.  We  believe  that
housebreakings, thefts, murders and rapes that have become so  prevalent  in
rural  areas  will  be  reduced  dramatically  if  traditional  leaders  are
restored. We cannot, as often as we do, talk about promotion  of  indigenous
knowledge, culture, languages and tourism and at the same time suppress  and
ignore this important institution.

The ACDP welcomes  this  Bill,  albeit  coming  in  the  eleventh  hour  and
inadequate,  in  some  respects,   in   terms   of   compliance   with   the
constitutional imperatives and the discharge of  government  responsibility.
The Bill recognises the institution and provides a framework for its  powers
and functions. The ACDP calls upon the Minister, once and for all,  to  free
the institution from Government control, which has marred it since  colonial
and apartheid times.
This democratic Government must  not  follow  the  ugly  path  of  the  past
governments of suppressing and  manipulating  chiefs  and  kings  for  party
politics. The ACDP calls for the restoration of the dignity  of  traditional
leaders. Lastly, we call upon the traditional leaders themselves to  refrain
and desist from participating in party politics as this,  in  our  view,  is
repugnant to the  role  chiefs  and  kings  should  play  in  uniting  their
subjects. Thank you.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Geagte Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker,  al  die  sprekers,  of
die meeste  sprekers,  kom  hierso  en  hulle  sê  dat  hierdie  wetsontwerp
erkenning gee aan tradisionele leiers.

Hierdie wetsontwerp gee erkenning aan die bestaan van  tradisionele  leiers,
maar gee nie erkenning aan die magte en bevoegdhede van tradisionele  leiers
nie. Die wetsontwerp stel die funksies van 'n raad vir  tradisionele  leiers
en hierdie funksies is bloot adviserend van aard. Tradisionele  leiers  word
basies gelyk gestel aan wyksbuurtes, want hulle kan slegs  advies  gee.  Die
probleem  van  hierdie  wetsontwerp   is   dat   tradisionele   leiers   nie
besluitnemingsmagte of bevoegdhede het nie.

As ons gaan kyk na die toestand wat tans in plaaslike  Regering  heers,  dan
wil ons vir die agb Minister sê plaaslike Regering het  op  hierdie  stadium
vennote nodig en nie adviseurs nie.

Die Vryheidsfront is daarvan oortuig dat tradisionele leiers  vir  seker  'n
bydrae kan maak tot plaaslike Regering deur te verseker dat  dienstelewering
en ekonomiese ontwikkeling tot  voordeel  van  gemeenskappe  kan  plaasvind.
Daar is verder ook baie  beloftes  gemaak  met  die  aanloop  van  die  1994
verkiesing en spesifieke beloftes wat gemaak is aan die IVP. Dit is  tyd  en
die tyd het aangebreek dat daardie beloftes nou nagekom moet word.

Ek wil vir die agb lid Mnr Durand, wat hom net-nou hier  kom  uitspreek  het
oor die aanloop van die 1994 verkiesing, sê daar is 'n spreekwoord wat sê:


  Argumenteer nie met 'n idioot nie, want hy het die vermoë om  jou  af  te
  trek na sy vlak toe en dan klop hy jou met ervaring.

Ek kan sien die agb  lid  het  baie  ervaring.  Die  Vryheidsfront  sal  nie
hierdie wetsontwerp steun nie. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, all the speakers, or  most  of
the speakers, come  here  and  say  that  this  Bill  gives  recognition  to
traditional leaders.

This Bill gives recognition to the existence  of  traditional  leaders,  but
does not give recognition to the powers of  traditional  leaders.  The  Bill
prescribes the functions of a council  for  traditional  leaders  and  these
functions  are  merely  of  an  advisory  nature.  Traditional  leaders  are
basically made equally to ward areas, because they  can  only  give  advice.
The problem with this Bill is that traditional  leaders  have  no  decision-
making powers.
If we go and look at the present state of local government, then we want  to
tell the hon Minister that at this stage  local  government  needs  partners
and not advisers.]

The Freedom Front is convinced that traditional leaders can  certainly  make
a contribution to Local Government  to  ensure  that  service  delivery  and
economic development  can  take  place  to  the  advantage  of  communities.
Furthermore many promises were made in the run-up to the 1994  election  and
specific promises were made to the IFP. The time  has  now  come  for  those
promises to be fulfilled.

I want to say to the hon member Mr Durand, who had something  to  say  about
the run-up to the 1994 election, that there is a proverb which says:


  Argumenteer nie met 'n idioot nie, want hy het die vermoë om  jou  af  te
  trek na sy vlak toe en dan klop hy jou met ervaring.

I can see that the hon member does have a lot  of  experience.  The  Freedom
Front will not support this Bill. Thank you.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Motlotlegi Motlatsa Sebui,  [Hon  Deputy  Speaker,]  it  is
regrettable when political upstarts such as the hon  Durand  try  to  endear
themselves to the ANC stable by babbling irrelevantly. My advice to  him  is
to beware  of  the  flea  in  the  blanket  he  is  sharing  with  the  ANC.
[Laughter.]

The ANC-led Government has at last, after nine years  of  nonchalance,  been
able to present a piece of legislation on traditional leadership. This is  a
clear sign of how this Government views traditional leadership:  as  one  of
those aspects that can be considered towards the end  of  the  term  of  the
second Parliament.

Premiers will have to be careful when  recognising  traditional  communities
and not strut like colossuses: experience has shown that they  are  wont  to
err, as was the case in the North  West,  where  the  Premier  recognised  a
traditional  community  by  dividing  the  Amahlubi  tribe   without   prior
consultation with the iNkosi and his council. Premiers will have  to  accept
such responsibility.

The piece of legislation was delayed in order to  phase  in  municipalities,
in the hope that they would render traditional  leadership  redundant.  That
not being  the  case,  the  Bill  is  introduced  to  jack  up  the  failing
municipalities. [Interjections.] Out of the 12 functions of the  traditional
council, six are aimed at municipalities and those that have  a  bearing  on
the life and soul of traditional leaders are secondary.

We know that being in Government hauls reality  to  the  fore.  Contrary  to
what the ANC and other liberation movements said before ascending to  power,
they have now made provisions and procedures  so  that  they  can  remove  a
traditional leader from power.

We welcome, however, the establishment of houses of traditional  leaders  in
district and metropolitan municipalities to enable them to share matters  of
common concern. We  would  not  go  for  a  restriction  of  their  numbers,
however. We say all traditional leaders  within  a  municipality  should  be
members of the house.

Dispute resolution mechanisms regarding the  issues  of  customary  law  and
custom are welcomed, and so  is  the  establishment  of  the  commission  on
traditional leadership disputes and claims. The UCDP will not  support  this
Bill.

Chief M NONKONYANA: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, 11  November  will
go down in our history as the day  on  which  the  ANC-led  Government  took
another concrete step  towards  restoring  the  pride  and  dignity  of  the
institution of traditional leadership in South Africa. [Applause.]

We should not forget that the  institution  of  traditional  leadership  has
been under vicious attack from  the  time  the  colonialists  imposed  their
regime and its system of governance on the African people. The  colonialists
inflicted untold damage on many Africans by inculcating in their minds  that
the only system of governance which  is  democratic  and  people-centred  is
their own, so much so that, unfortunately, even some  African  intellectuals
regarded the institution of traditional leadership as  having  outlived  its
usefulness in society and as such should be consigned to a bottomless pit.

President Thabo Mbeki assured our traditional leaders that  the  institution
of traditional leadership in South Africa is here to stay side by side  with
democratic institutions, ... [Applause.] ...  which  will  deepen  democracy
and better the lives of all South Africans. Our  Constitution  provides  for
three  spheres  of  government  and  for  a  role  for  the  institution  of
traditional leadership in all these spheres.

The Bill now provides that henceforth there shall be a house of  traditional
leaders in all three spheres, that is at district, provincial  and  national
levels. Provincial and national houses of traditional  leaders  provide,  of
course, for the role of traditional leaders at both provincial and  national
spheres of government. The ANC-led Government is committed to  strengthening
the capacity of these houses so as to fulfil their constitutional mandates.

Bills and bylaws pertaining to the institution  of  traditional  leadership,
including culture and customs, will be referred to  these  houses.  The  new
district house of traditional leaders will, of course, replace the  regional
authorities. These are in essence new structures, and these will be more  or
less equal in  status  to  district  municipal  councils.  Their  roles  and
functions are clearly set out in this Bill.  These  structures  must  be  in
place within one year of the promulgation of this Act,  and  in  many  areas
two or more regional authorities will be combined into one.  This  one  year
is, of course, intended for them to wind up their activities.

There shall, therefore, be one district house  of  traditional  leaders  per
one district municipality or metro council.  For  instance,  for  the  first
time in our history, we will now have  the  O  R  Tambo  District  House  of
Traditional Leaders in the  Eastern  Cape;  ...  [Applause.]  ...  the  King
Tshaka district house in  KwaZulu-Natal;  the  Nkangala  district  house  in
Mpumalanga;  the  Sekhukhuni  district  house  in  Limpopo;  the   Kgalagadi
district house in North  West  and  Northern  Cape  and,  named  after  that
gallant fighter of our revolution, the Thabo Mofutsanyana district house  in
the Free State. Who knew that we would have a structure  called  the  Durban
Metro house of traditional leaders? There is also that possibility.

Kuyacaca ke, Mhlalingaphambili namalungu ahloniphekileyo, ukuba  lo  Mthetho
uYilwayo singawo  namhlanje  ubuyisa  isidima  nesihomo  sobukhosi  eMzantsi
Afrika. [Uwelewele]. Yiyo loo nto ke uya kuqaphela  ukuba  ngokwalo  Mthetho
uYilwayo, luza kuba  semagxeni  alaa  komishoni  yabameli  boluntu  uxanduva
lokubonelela ngezibonelelo ezizizo zonke iinkosi  eziza  kube  zikhona  kula
mabhunga olawulo obukhosi. Itheth' ukuthi ke loo  nto  -  njengoko  ndiqonda
ukuba abanye abakwazi oko - ukunikwa kwamabhunga ama-50  eesenti  ngenyanga,
kuthiwe eso sisibonelelo se ``horse allowance'', izinto  ezinjalo  ziyaphela
ngokukhokelwa ngulo Mbutho weSizwe (iANC). (Translation of  Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[It is clear then, Chairperson and  hon  members,  that  this  Bill  we  are
debating today is aimed at bringing back pride and  dignity  of  traditional
leaders in South Africa. [Interjection.] This Bill provides -  as  you  will
notice - for the Human Rights Commission to  be  responsible  for  providing
proper services to traditional  leaders  in  these  structures.  That  means
therefore, that the different houses of traditional leaders would no  longer
be given paltry allowances of 50 cents called horse allowances. The  ANC-led
Government is going to provide well for them.]

The ANC-led  Government  has,  indeed,  also  delivered  a  better  life  to
traditional leaders  as  promised  in  its  manifesto  of  1999.  The  Bill,
therefore, lays a firm  and  concrete  foundation  for  the  institution  of
traditional leadership in this country. Nowhere in the world,  I  dare  say,
and nowhere in Africa will you find any framework of this  nature.  We  must
praise ourselves for having produced another miracle.

Ungaya   kwaSotshangana,   ungaya   kwesikaMzilikazi,   udibane    namakhosi
neekumkani zakhona, ziya kukuxelela okokuba kuseMzantsi Afrika apho  ithemba
labo likhona. [Uwelewele.] [If you go to Zimbabwe or  Mozambique,  you  will
hear chiefs and kings telling you  that  their  hope  is  in  South  Africa.
[Interjections.]

The ANC-led Government is  aware  that  Rome  was  not  built  in  one  day.
AmaXhosa ke  athi:  ``Inene  indlu  yegagu  iyanetha.''  Ukuba  ngaba  indlu
uyibeka  elulwalweni,  asiyondlu  leyo.  [Xhosas  say:  The  house  of   the
talkative person lets in rain. This means that one who talks  too  much  has
very little time to do other things.] As a result, even the very  elementary
and necessary home duties are neglected and when rain falls, the house  will
let in water. Just as the house will let  in  water,  so  will  a  talkative
person crumble under test because his armoury is not  quite  effective.  So,
if you build a house on unsuitable land, it will collapse.
We may not, of course, have provided for  everything  that  our  traditional
leaders wanted. However, I want to assure everyone  that  the  majority,  if
not the overwhelming majority, of traditional leaders agree  that  the  Bill
signals a clear and unequivocal commitment  of  the  ANC-led  Government  to
protecting and promoting the institution of traditional leadership in  South
Africa. We must make it clear though, that our vision of the institution  is
that it has a major role in nation-building.  It  must,  therefore,  advance
our national democratic evolution and our vision of nation-building.

We are opposed to the notion that the institution should be relegated  to  a
level of advancing petty tribal or ethnic interest. Our institution  is  too
important to be degraded to such levels.

Kungoko  ke  sibongoza  into  yokuba  akwaba  abantwana  begazi,  iikumkani,
iinkosi namaphakathi ogaga, angathi  ahlangabezane  nombutho  wesizwe  i-ANC
ukwenza la mabhunga abe ngamabhunga esizwe,  abe  liqhayiya  lesizwe,  ukuze
abantu abaya kuthi bakhonze kula  mabhunga  bazinikezele  nofele  ekulweleni
okokuba abantu  beli  babe  nempilo  engcono  nentle  ngokukhokelwa  yi-ANC.
Bayethe! (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[That is why we plead that if only people from royal houses,  kings,  chiefs
and their subjects, could come closer to the  ANC  so  as  to  create  these
houses to be houses of traditional leadership that are  recognised  and  are
the pride of the nation, so that people that would eventually serve in  them
could commit themselves fully to making life better for the people  of  this
country through the leadership of the ANC. I greet you all!]

HON MEMBERS:  Bayethe! [We greet you!]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  the  short  time  I  have  been
allocated to  participate  in  this  important  debate  on  the  Traditional
Leadership  and  Governance  Framework  Bill,  allow  me  to  summarise   my
contribution as follows.

It is a conundrum of conundrums that after the purported liberation  nothing
much has changed with  regard  to  land  dispossession  and  powers  of  the
descendants of our traditional leaders.

The Constitution and laws of the rainbow nation have made a mockery  of  the
most important institution in our country  which  enabled  Africans  not  to
give in to colonialism without resistance, however  inferior  their  weapons
were.  Today  those  who  are  victims  of  Eurocentricity  and  Afrocentric
disorientation have given rise to homosexuals and abortionists on demand  to
reduce  our  population,  making  our   country   a   dumping   ground   for
overpopulated countries. But what is happening to  the  descendants  of  our
heroic kings and queens  who  were  the  first  to  defend  this  land  from
colonial aggression?

Without proper involvement of traditional leaders  in  the  affairs  of  our
country, rural development will remain a pipe dream. The treatment meted  to
traditional leaders in terms of their residences,  roads  leading  to  their
residences,  their  salaries,  their  transport,  their  facilities  in  the
National  House  of  Traditional   Leaders,   their   deprivation   of   the
administration of customary  law  and  their  protection  of  African  moral
values is tantamount to the abolition  of  the  institution  of  traditional
leaders.

Although this Bill is a slight improvement on the role  and  powers  of  the
traditional leaders, it will not mean much unless sections 211  and  212  of
the Constitution are amended and stated in clear, mandatory language.

It is a shame that a colonial soldier, Harry Smith, who killed King  Hintsa,
has a town named after him in this country while King Hintsa,  who  fell  in
national dignity during a battle for our land, is treated like a  nonentity.
This  is  Eurocentricity  gone  eccentric.  The  PAC  demands  that  genuine
descendants of our kings and queens be given  more  respect  and  meaningful
negotiation.

I, therefore, am saying:  Let  us  remember  the  traditional  leaders  that
protected our land; the likes of Mjongantshiyini. Our land!

   Ngoko ke, mna ndithi: Thina masikhumbuleni ukwamkela  iinkosi  ezakhusela
   ilizwe lethu; iinkosi ezinje ngooMjongantshiyini bath' uqumbile;  inkunz'
   abayikhuz'  ukuhlaba  ingekahlabi.  Izigodlwana  zemaz'endala,  zingalal'
   endlini  yazini  kunyembelekile.  Iinkos'  ezinje'ngophaqa   njengelanga,
   inyathi yaseNtlakantlakeni, unokuzil' ukudla  kwamagwala.  Amagwal'  adl'
   ububende. Izwe lethu!

[Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, with our  first  democratic  election
in 1994 we embarked upon instituting a democracy. With the  introduction  of
our national Constitution in 1996 as supreme law of the land  we  have  done
so - protecting and enhancing individual rights with our Bill of Rights.

In our Constitution we further drafted the structure of our  Government  and
its  functions.  The  same  Constitution  made  provision  for   traditional
leadership, having invoked the recognition and role of traditional leaders.
The MF strongly notes the importance of upholding and respecting  tradition,
stemming from a very cultural  and  traditional  society.  We  hold  a  high
respect for the traditional leaders of South Africa. The MF feels  that  the
traditional  leaders  have  a  role  to  play  in  a  local  and  provincial
government.

The  Bill  at  hand  seeks  to  inaugurate  the  constitutional   provisions
concerning traditional leadership. The MF  is  interested  in  the  National
Council of Traditional Leaders  and  finds  that  provisions  made  in  this
respect will accommodate order in the system.  Further  provisions  made  in
the light of traditional communities and traditional leaders are  supported,
as long as they abide by the Constitution.

Further provisions in terms of  a  house  of  traditional  leaders,  dispute
management and the commissioning of traceable leadership and  dispute  plans
appear to have been devised. The MF respects tradition and  its  inculcation
in South African society within the  boundaries  of  our  Constitution,  the
supreme  law  of  our  country.  The  MF  hereby  supports  the  Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G A J  GROBLER:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  have  listened  to  various
speakers from different  political  parties  regarding  their  views  around
issues in the Traditional Leadership and  Governance  Framework  Bill.  Some
are in favour of the Bill, whereas others have contrary views. No  one,  and
in particular we in the DA, has denied the  fact  that  traditional  leaders
have a major role to play in the South  African  political  arena.  This  is
clearly recognised in Chapter 12 of the Constitution.

I want  to  talk,  firstly,  about  the  recognition  of  the  leaders,  and
secondly, the role of  the  traditional  leaders.  It  is  obvious,  if  one
listens to different viewpoints expressed here  today,  that  not  everybody
interprets this chapter of the Constitution the same way. We in  the  DA  do
not believe that the Constitution, which already recognises the role of  the
traditional leaders, should be easily tampered with.
However, there are a few issues which need to be  looked  at.  These  issues
came out during deliberations and inputs received from  stakeholders  during
public hearings. Some have not  been  adequately  finalised  and  are  again
being put on the back burner, as it has been with this  Bill  for  the  last
couple of years. But, due to a lack of time, I would like to mention only  a
few unclear and unresolved matters.

The nonreference to the Khoisan in this Bill has merit only as far as it  is
acknowledging some of  the  shortcomings  of  this  Bill.  According  to  my
reference, the name Khoisan in itself  is  misleading,  artificial,  totally
illogical and has no real historical content. It will  take  anyone  who  is
serious about historical facts as far back as the desk of  Prof  Schulte  in
1928. The only purpose of the artificial use of names is pure  manipulation.
But the promises in the committee and the report to deal with  the  specific
needs and interests of these people are empty, because there are  no  budget
allocations to realise such promises. It has been postponed to  sometime  in
the future again. I think intervention from Government is necessary to  fund
proper, unbiased research and the funding of  the  publication  of  research
already done. A Bill should not only cater  for  the  Nguni  or  the  Sotho-
speaking traditional leaders and exclude people such as the Khoisan.

Another disturbing viewpoint that was expressed during  discussions  in  the
committee was the fact that the ANC members in the committee wanted to  deny
traditional leaders their democratic right, as citizens of this country,  to
participate  in  party-political  activities.  A   phasing-out   period   is
suggested, which in our view is totally ridiculous and outrageous.

The Bill makes provision for the institution of  traditional  leaders,  such
as kings and queens, senior traditional leaders, headmen and headwomen.  The
DA agrees that the Government must not be too  prescriptive  concerning  the
names that traditional leaders in various positions  are  called.  They  are
the  traditional  names  of  traditional  leaders.  Leave  it  up   to   the
traditional leaders to decide what to call their respective leaders.

Maar 'n kommerwekkende aspek in die  beoogde  wetgewing  is  die  finansiële
impak op die belastingbetaler in Suid-Afrika. Gedurende komiteesittings  het
die DA sy kommer uitgespreek  oor  die  geweldige  kostes  wat  die  beoogde
wetgewing  gaan   meebring.   Die   daarstelling   van   distrikshuise   vir
tradisionele leiers gaan 'n geskatte bedrag van  meer  as  R33  miljoen  per
jaar uit die belastingbetaler se sak jaag.

Byna R9 miljoen word voorsien vir die  daarstelling  van  'n  kommissie  wat
geskille onder tradisionele leiers moet besleg, maar die ergste is die  meer
as R60 miljoen vir die vergoeding van hoofmanne en -vroue. Daar is  aan  die
begin heelwat hoër syfers genoem  as  die  R60  miljoen  wat  tans  aan  ons
voorgehou word.

In baie gevalle kan hierdie salarisse wat die hoofmanne en  vroue  gaan  kry
meer wees as die vergoeding van raadslede. Hierdie ondeurdagte besluit  gaan
lei tot konflik, en die departement erken  dat  die  syfers  bloot  geskatte
syfers  is  en  nie  eers  die   addisionele   kostes   soos   mediese-   en
pensioenfondsbydraes inreken nie. Ons  kan  'n  situasie  bereik  waar  daar
skielik nuwe hoofmanne en -vroue te voorskyn tree. Die DA se siening  is  in
ieder geval  dat  hoofmanne  slegs  vergoed  behoort  te  word  vir  dienste
gelewer, soos byvoorbeeld registrasies van  geboortes  en  sterftes.  So  'n
stelsel van vergoeding moet dan eenvormig wees,  en  landswyd  op  dieselfde
basis toegepas word.

Ons het onlangs gesien wat het in Mpumalanga  gebeur  waar  die  Premier  30
motors aan hoofmanne uitgedeel het, en dit tot algehele misbruik  gelei  het
- tot groot kostes vir die belastingbetaler.

Die DA steun beslis nie die voorgenome wetgewing, soos ons agb lid  van  die
Nuwe NP, mnr Durand, so entoesiasties gedoen  het  nie,  maar  bes  moontlik
sien hy die moontlikheid dat hy dalk so 'n hoofmanpossie kan  kry.  Maar  jy
moet nie vergeet nie, daar is nog agb Boy  wat  dalk  'n  adjunkhoofman  kan
word en jou leier soek ook 'n pos, want  ek  dink  julle  is  almal  in  die
aandskemering van julle politieke lewe. [Gelag.] Ek  wil  net  vir  die  agb
Durand sê: Jou min optrede in die komitee, of glad nie somtyds, was  in  elk
geval so power, dis g'n wonder jy het van  die  punt  afgedwaal  en  'n  lot
nonsens kwytgeraak nie. Jy was byna nooit in die komitee om te weet  wat  in
hierdie voorgenome wet staan nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek wil  vir  agb  Durand
nog 'n ding sê: dit gaan jou nie help om oor te loop na  die  ANC  toe  nie.
[Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But a concerning aspect in  the  envisaged  legislation  is  the  financial
impact on the taxpayer in South Africa. During the committee  sittings,  the
DA  voiced  its  concern  about  the  immense  costs  which  the   envisaged
legislation will bring about. The  implementation  of  district  houses  for
traditional leaders will set the taxpayer back an estimated  amount  of  R33
million per annum.

Almost R9 million is provided for the implementation of a  commission  which
will settle disputes between traditional leaders, but the worst is the  more
than  R60   million   remuneration   of   traditional   leaders.   Initially
considerably higher figures were mentioned than the  R60  million  which  is
currently put to us.

In many cases these salaries,  which  the  chiefs  will  receive,  would  be
higher than the remuneration of councillors.  This  ill-considered  decision
will lead to conflict and the department admits that the figures  were  mere
estimates and it does not include additional costs like medical and  pension
contributions. We can  get  to  the  situation  where  new  chiefs  suddenly
appear. The DA's position, in any case, is that chiefs should only  be  paid
for services rendered, like for instance registration of births and  deaths.
There must be uniformity in such a system of remuneration  and  it  must  be
applied on the same basis countrywide.

We have seen what happened in Mpumalanga where the  Premier  gave  30  motor
cars to chiefs, and it led  to  total  abuse  -  at  great  expense  to  the
taxpayer.

The DA definitely does not support the proposed legislation,  like  our  hon
member of the New NP, Mr Durand, did so enthusiastically did, but  it  might
be that he sees himself getting a position as a chief. But  you  should  not
forget that there is still hon Boy who might become a deputy chief and  your
leader is also looking for a position, because I think you are  all  in  the
twilight of your political life. [Laughter.] I just want  to  tell  the  hon
Durand: Your little action in the committee, and sometimes none at all,  was
in any case so pathetic, it is therefore no wonder that  you  digressed  and
talked a lot of nonsense. You were almost never in the committee to be  able
to know what is written in  the  proposed  legislation.  [Interjections.]  I
want to point out one more thing to the hon Durand: It will not help you  to
defect to the ANC. [Time expired.]]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Deputy Speaker, will the member take a question?

Mr G A J GROBLER: Deputy Speaker, the chance  that  he  will  ask  a  decent
question is very slim, so I am not going to answer it. Thanks.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member. Your time  has  expired.  Hon  member,  take
your seat.

Mr B M KOMPHELA:  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  traditional  leaders  and
everybody here this afternoon, on 8 May 1996 South  Africans  declared  that
South Africa was one sovereign, democratic state founded on the  values  set
out in section 1 of the Constitution. Such  values  include  human  dignity,
the achievement  of  equality  and  the  advancement  of  human  rights  and
nonracism. The supreme law of the country is the  Constitution,  which  says
that there should be  regular  elections  and  a  multi-party  system  of  a
democratic government, which we achieved in 1994.

On 8 May 1996 the Constitutional Assembly, after  a  lengthy  and  elaborate
consultation  process  involving   all   South   Africans,   declared   that
Government, and no one else, must exercise authority over all  other  things
as decided by the people of this country on that day.

Let me put it differently, that the 1996  Constitution  defines  the  nature
and character of the South African  state.  However,  the  people  of  South
Africa also  made  a  provision  in  the  Constitution  to  accommodate  the
question  of  traditional  leadership.  That  was  a  clear  and   conscious
recognition of and respect for  traditional  leadership,  contrary  to  what
other people are saying.

The Constitution, however, left a number of issues to national  legislation.
Such national  legislation  includes  this  piece  of  legislation  that  is
presented to you today, that helps to deal with the nitty gritties  of  what
is said in the national Constitution.

The Bill deals with the role  and  function  of  traditional  leadership  in
governance  generally.  The  specific  role  and  function  of   traditional
leadership  in  different  areas,  for  example  customary   justice,   land
administration and welfare, will be dealt with, as the chairperson  of  this
committee  said,  by  the  different  Ministers  and  portfolio   committees
concerned.

However, traditional leaders and others, during our  public  hearings,  said
that the word ``Chief'' was an incorrect word.  I  think  they  were  saying
that the word ``Chief'' has had its meaning diminished or  has  become  very
derogatory. Therefore the department sat and looked at an  appropriate  term
that could be used. The department then introduced  what  we  call  ``senior
traditional leader''.

Still on the  question  of  senior  traditional  leadership,  the  portfolio
committee supported it. However, the term  is  just  used  in  the  national
framework. Each and every province, in terms of this legislation, will  have
its own terms.

Ha re fihla Foreisetata, re tla  bitsa  marena  a  rona  marena.  Xa  sifika
ekhaya, siza kubiza iinkosi zethu njengeenkosi. Asizi kuzibiza ngale  ndlela
which is prescribed in  this  piece  of  legislation  ichazwe  kulo  Mthetho
uSayilwayo. Siza kuzibiza ngokwendlela ezibizwa  ngayo  kumaphondo  esihlala
kuwo, ngendlela eziyifunayo neziyithandayo. (Translation of Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[When we get to the Free State, we will refer to our chiefs as marena.  When
we get to our homes, we will refer to our traditional leaders as chiefs.  We
will not refer to them according to the way  which  is  prescribed  in  this
piece of legislation. We will call them the  way  they  are  called  in  our
provinces, which is what they want and like.]

I would like to go  further  and  say  that  the  debates  on  the  role  of
traditional leadership will not die today. With the passage  of  this  piece
of legislation, there is one major  question  that  all  of  us  are  almost
sceptical to face, and that is the matter of ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, there is  too  much  talking.  Could
you please give the hon member audience.

Mr B M KOMPHELA: There is a major question to which we must give a  concrete
answer. It is a difficult question that many of  us  are  almost  afraid  to
face, namely whether traditional leaders should be allowed  to  operate  and
function as  politicians.  That  is  one  of  the  biggest,  but  also  more
difficult, questions. But the reality on the  ground  warrants  us  to  face
this challenge and reality, and to dispose of the real question, ie  whether
they should play a role in political activities.

There will come a time when traditional leaders will not be allowed to  play
a dual role. The role and the functions  which  the  Bill  assigns  to  them
should be saying: ``This is how we intend for you to  unify  our  people  in
this country.'' In the political arena, the Bill should be saying:  ``  Your
dignity  as  traditional  leaders  is  at  stake.  Therefore  your   careful
participation in the political arena will enable you to be the  unifiers  of
our people and to keep your dignity intact, as a traditional leadership.''

I think I must just round off with two responses. Hon Grobler said that  the
Bill is wrong and therefore there is no way that he can support  it.  He  is
saying that politicians  or  traditional  leaders  are  just  wasting  time,
because in Mpumalanga, for example, 30  cars  were  given  to  irresponsible
traditional leaders. That is what he said. He also said that these  30  cars
were not used properly.

He said that even the amount of money allocated to  traditional  leadership,
in terms of this Bill, is too much; too much  because  maybe  today  we  are
recognising  traditional  leadership.  But,  if  it  was   a   question   of
recognising a volkstaat, that amount of money was going to be  very  little.
[Interjections.] The input of traditional leaders and  the  amount  of  work
that the traditional leaders are doing presently outweighs the  amount  that
Mr Grobler is talking about.

The FF, at the committees and regarding the  Bills  that  have  been  passed
here,  would  talk  about  cultural  determination  -  a  volkstaat's  self-
determination. Today we are talking about  a  cultural  aspect,  a  cultural
matter. It is not about self-determination  of  a  small  island,  which  is
different - like another independent state within a democratic country.

They are the people who were crying for that. Today he is saying: ``No,  the
status of traditional leadership has been diminished.'' Is  it  because  the
issue  of  traditional  leadership  being  handled  today  deals  with   the
recognition of traditional leaders, which relates to black people?  That  is
why he is having that kind of an objection. But if the issue was  raised  by
a white counterpart, he would have blessed it  and  even  taken  it  to  the
Supreme Court.

Nkosi yam, Nkosi uHlengwa, we-IFP, uphixanisa izinto apha. [My chief,  Chief
Hlengwa of the IFP, you are confusing things.]

You are talking very much, and wisely, about issues of  administration.  Yet
here we are  talking  about  a  broad  policy  framework  which  traditional
leaders should work on. Whether they have a chair or a phone,  or  whatever,
I don't think that this Bill is bound to articulate on  that.  So  when  you
talk about these other things, which are administrative issues, I think  you
are referring them to the wrong place. The Bill will not be  in  a  position
to accommodate those kind of things.

The DA speaks about a lack of consultation around this  Bill.  Hon  members,
this Bill has been under  consultation  for  almost  five  years.  They  are
saying - including the FF - that at the end of the day after a long  decade,
it is only today that this Bill is passed. But we were  careful  to  consult
each and every person. In any event, where Mr Grobler comes  from,  they  do
not know what traditional leadership is.

In this country of ours I still expect the IFP and  the  DA  to  bring  this
white traditional leadership that will articulate  the  African  traditional
leadership perspective. I want them ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon member. [Applause.]
Mr B M KOMPHELA: Thank you,  Speaker.  Hon  Seremane,  ...  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,
allow me to thank all hon members who took part in  this  discussion.  Nkosi
Nonkonyana, who took part in all the consultation  processes  which  led  to
the formulation of this  Bill,  characterised  this  event  as  a  watershed
development. He knows what he is talking about. I agree  with  him,  because
indeed the step which we  are  taking  today  restores  the  institution  of
traditional leadership to its rightful place.

The institution will, once more, occupy pride of place in the bosom  of  our
people. Once more the institution will become  a  reliable  partner  in  the
struggle against poverty and underdevelopment.

The hon Mr Groenewald warned us against  the  dangers  of  arguing  with  an
idiot. I must tell him that I heed his warning; I'm not going to argue  with
him. [Laughter.]

The hon Mr Joe Seremane pointed to a number of what  he  calls  ``problems''
in the Bill. He did say, however, by way of a prephrase, that  he  is  doing
so after a quick perusal. Perhaps the perusal was too quick to allow him  to
make an intelligent assessment.

He went further  to  bemoan  the  fact  -  he  made  an  allegation  -  that
traditional communities  were  not  consulted.  Of  course,  if  traditional
communities were still part of his points of reference, the fact that  these
communities were consulted would not have escaped his attention.

The hon member Mr Hlengwa regards this Bill ... [Interjections.]  ...  Nkosi
Hlengwa, yes ... as a  formula  for  disaster.  But  his  own  input,  right
together with that of the hon  Mr  Seremane,  indicates  that  the  emerging
right-wing coalition is  crying  out  for  the  attention  of  our  disaster
management centre. [Laughter.]

As I said, once more I want to thank all  those  who  participated  in  this
discussion, especially those who made sensible observations that need to  be
taken forward as we implement this Bill, once it has  been  enacted  by  the
House. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.

The House divided.

    SOUTH AFRICAN SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY BILL AND SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  I
want to begin by thanking the  House  for  the  opportunity  to  submit  the
Social Assistance and South African Social Security  Agency  Bills  for  the
Second Reading debate.  The  two  pieces  of  legislation  provide  for  the
implementation of the  national  integrated  and  cohesive  social  security
system that improves the social protection of the most vulnerable people  in
our society.

As indicated  in  Government's  discussion  document  ``Towards  a  Ten-Year
Review'', improving social security is one of the key challenges facing  our
nation in the next decade. We have to  ensure  more  efficient  delivery  of
social grants to  rural  beneficiaries,  reduction  of  corruption  and  the
incorporation of grants into a system of comprehensive  social  security  in
this country.

The  Social  Assistance  Bill  consolidates  the  legal   requirements   and
provisions for social assistance, and creates uniform  norms  and  standards
that apply countrywide.  The  South  African  Social  Security  Agency  Bill
establishes an agency to ensure  the  efficient  and  effective  management,
administration and payment of social security grants. As  indicated  in  the
Ten-Year Review, the provision of social grants  is  the  Government's  most
effective programme to address the income poverty of our people.

The grants currently administered by the Department  of  Social  Development
are targeted  to  oldest  persons,  disabled  persons,  poor  families  with
children, war veterans, and households taking care of  children  and  people
in need. The expenditure on these social  grants  has  increased  3,5  times
between 1994 and the year 2003  from  R10  billion  to  R34,8  billion.  The
number of beneficiaries has increased from 2,6 million to 6,8 million.

Research of the Ten-Year Review also shows  that  grants  are  exceptionally
well targeted. The poorest 20% of our population and of households  receives
the largest amounts from grants not just as  a  proportion  of  income,  but
also in absolute terms. Two thirds of the income for the poorest  people  in
this country is attributable to state's transfers. Simulation  studies  also
show that, in the absence of any grants, 55,9% of the elderly  would  be  in
poverty and 38,2% would be in ultra poverty. This falls to  22,9%  and  2,5%
respectively if all recipients get grants.

Although great progress has been made in registering  recipients,  the  full
impact of the grants will only be realised  when  all  eligible  people  are
registered. In addition,  because  of  certain  gaps  between  national  and
provincial legislation, and inadequacies in the current  administration  and
payment  of  grants,  some  eligible  people  do   not   timeously   receive
assistance.

Furthermore, there is uneven access  to  grants,  unequal  service  delivery
standards, budget uncertainties and significant  persistent  fraud  in  some
provinces.

The Constitution enjoins us to ensure that services are provided for  in  an
equitable and dignified manner. Government has, therefore,  prioritised  the
improvement of service delivery in these areas, and  the  Bills  before  the
House will enhance the ability of the machinery of Government to  fast-track
pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

The Social Assistance and  South  African  Social  Security  Bills  are  the
culmination of a long process of moving South Africa from a  fragmented  and
incoherent social security system to a cohesive  national  security  system.
I,  therefore,  extend  my  sincere  appreciation  to  the  members  of  the
Portfolio Committee on Social Development for  their  various  deliberations
on and contribution to the Bills.

I  also  wish  to  express  my  gratitude  to  the  various  civil   society
organisations  that  made  submissions  and  participated  in   the   public
hearings.  The  social  development  of   our   people   is   a   collective
responsibility  that  should  not  be  held  to  ransom  by  narrow   vested
interests.

A national system of social security  is  an  imperative.  The  recent  High
Court judgment in the  Mashavhna  case,  declaring  the  assignment  of  the
administration of the Social Assistance Act to provinces  invalid,  confirms
the correctness of our view to nationalise the function.

Achieving a national system of social  assistant  provision  is,  therefore,
the main objective of the Bill. We are aware  of  the  policy  gaps  in  the
system  and  these  are  being  dealt  with  in  our  ongoing  work  on  the
development  of  a  comprehensive  social  security  system.  It  would   be
irresponsible of  us  not  to  finalise  these  Bills  while  we  are  still
deliberating on the policy of options for a  comprehensive  social  security
system, as our detractors have asked us to do.

It should be noted that the object of the Social Assistance Bill is  not  to
introduce any new  provision  for  extended  social  assistance  grants.  As
indicated earlier, the objective is to put in place a  national  legislative
framework for existing social assistance grants.

The South African Social Assistance Bill  also  establishes  an  independent
inspectorate for social assistance, whose function it is to ensure that  the
integrity of the social grant system is not compromised.

We cannot accept the levels of fraud that occur in the  current  system.  We
are aware of the criminal syndicates and  their  accomplices,  both  outside
and inside  government,  who  are  fraudulently  accessing  grants.  We  are
ensuring that all fraud  cases  are  vigorously  investigated  and  internal
control measures are being intensified in the social security system.

Government has only one  message  for  the  criminal  syndicates  and  their
accomplices: We are coming after you  and  will  bring  to  a  halt  to  all
criminal activities that deny the poor  and  vulnerable  people  in  society
their rights to social security, irrespective of who they are.

The Social Assistance  Bill  also  addresses  the  issue  of  political  and
administrative  accountability  and  oversight.  Provisions   allowing   the
Minister of Social Development to delegate the management administration  of
social assistance grants are stipulated. The  Bill  also  provides  for  the
publishing of  regulations  on  the  norms  and  standards  for  performance
management and adherence to the Batho Pele principles.

The South  African  Social  Security  Agency  Bill  establishes  a  focused,
specialist institution for  the  management  and  administration  of  social
assistance grants. The establishment of the Social  Security  Agency  is  an
acknowledgement that, in terms of our institutional arrangements, we need  a
unitary but flexible service delivery mechanism.

The agency's function and role is  straightforward,  namely,  to  administer
social assistance and to make sure that we pay the  right  grant  amount  to
the right person, at the right time  and  in  a  dignified  manner  that  is
consistent with the  principle  of  Batho  Pele  and  the  Constitution.  By
establishing the agency, we are improving the  institutional  framework  and
processes for delivering social grants in this country.

Furthermore,  in  keeping  with  modern  approaches  to  public  management,
establishing  the  agency  allows  us  to   clear   separate   policy-making
responsibilities from service delivery. The  Minister  will  be  responsible
for policy and outcomes, while the chief executive  officer  of  the  agency
and an  accounting  officer  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  and
outputs. The Minister  will  continue  to  account  to  the  legislature  in
respect of the policy and delivery of social assistance.

More importantly, the South African  Social  Security  Agency  Bill  clearly
specifies and delineates the functions of the agency. The House will  recall
that the Chikane Commission in  1996  recommended  the  establishment  of  a
nationally  organised  social  security  system.  This  was  followed  by  a
carefully researched, rigorously constructed and widely  consulted  process,
which informed the Bills before you.

Before concluding, I would like to thank the  officials  from  the  national
and provincial departments of social development  for  their  hard  work  in
ensuring that these Bills adhere to the time  frames  set  by  Cabinet.  The
MECs of social development in the provinces have  played  a  vital  role  in
monitoring and ensuring the progress of the work on  both  Bills,  and  they
have my sincere gratitude. I also want to thank  my  colleagues,  Mr  Trevor
Manuel and Mrs Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi and their officials for working  so
closely  with   the   Department   of   Social   Development   and   sharing
responsibility on the transitional committee.

In conclusion, I have to say that  this  Second  Reading  of  the  Bills  is
taking  place  because  the  members  of  the  portfolio  committee   worked
arduously to refine the Bills. Hon members of the portfolio  committee,  you
have done your constituents and our people proud. I have no doubt  that  the
members of the select committee in the NCOP will show the  same  commitment.
Nangamso, kwanga uThixo angaba nani. Siyajabula.  [Thank  you,  may  God  be
with you. We are happy.] [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, the Minister  of  Social
Development, Zola Skweyiya, has been described  as  a  Minister  who  cares.
This was confirmed in a Sunday Times headline on  Sunday:  ``Minister  steps
in to help Aids orphans''. He gave permission for five  orphans  to  receive
antiretroviral treatment despite the fact that  the  Government  is  yet  to
approve a plan to supply the drugs  in  public  hospitals  and  clinics  ...
[Interjections.]

This could not have been an easy decision to  make  while  the  Minister  of
Health drags her feet over the ARV treatment plan. At  least  five  children
are now, thanks to the Minister, being given an opportunity which  thousands
are being denied daily. The report goes on to say:


  Skweyiya said of his swift decision: ``Children need to  be  assisted  as
  fast as possible to get whatever help is available.''

The Mail and Guardian calls the Minister,  ``point  man  against  poverty''.
The Department has a budget of more than R34 billion, as  the  Minister  has
already mentioned, for social grants to help 8 million South Africans  every
month. The DA congratulates  you,  Minister,  on  your  caring  and  on  the
achievements.

However, when it comes to legislation, the Minister seems to have  lost  the
plot. Today we are debating Bills which affect poor people, elderly  people,
children, people with disabilities and children needing foster  care  -  all
vulnerable people. They  are,  therefore,  crucially  important  Bills,  but
these Bills have not been given the time  of  day.  They  are  being  rushed
through Parliament with indecent haste.

Apart from some amendments to existing legislation, this department has  not
dealt with any major legislation in four  and  half  years,  and  all  of  a
sudden we are now in such a hurry. The question has to be asked, why? Is  it
because there is an election looming, and the Minister wants to impress  the
electorate to prove that he has been doing something? [Interjections.]

Because of this pre-election stampede, the public was only  given  one  week
to make submissions. [Interjections.] That is how important the  public  and
the Bills were considered to be.  During  the  public  hearings,  again  and
again, we were asked not to proceed  with  these  Bills.  The  Alliance  for
Children's Entitlement to Social  Security,  Cosatu,  Nehawu,  the  Catholic
Bishops' Conference and the SA Council of Churches all implored us  to  slow
down. They all wanted Parliament to engage with the Taylor Report  in  order
first to formulate a comprehensive  social  security  policy,  and  then  to
draft legislation.

As it stands now, we are allowing legislation to dictate policy. The  Taylor
Report, on which this Government has expended thousands of  rands,  is  just
ignored, brushed aside in the headlong charge to rush any  other  old  thing
through, as long as it's before elections. [Interjections.]

This legislation  continues  to  propagate  the  fragmentation  system,  the
problems of which were highlighted by the Pretoria High Court ruling in  the
Mashavhna case yesterday.

We do have a big problem out there with service delivery, but  this  is  not
the way to fix it. There is no guarantee  that  this  proposed  agency  will
improve service delivery to the beneficiaries. We  need  only  look  at  the
shambles in the National  Development  Agency,  which  was  set  up  with  a
mandate to eradicate poverty and its causes. At present, of  course,  as  we
know, it is being probed for allegations of  fraud  and  mismanagement.  The
losers are the beneficiaries.

The Social Assistance Bill fails to deal with  the  heart  of  the  problem:
child-headed households, refugees, street children, extending  the  age  for
children to receive the Child Support Grant, means  testing  and  the  Basic
Income Grant. These are dealt with in the Taylor Report, which the Bill  has
chosen to ignore.

There is another issue which is  of  great  concern  to  me.  The  portfolio
committee was still deliberating on the Bill - in  fact,  we  had  not  even
held the public hearings - when the department placed  an  advertisement  in
the Sunday Times advertising vacancies for  positions  in  the  agency.  The
department claimed they were merely research positions. In fact,  they  were
nothing of the sort. Here is the advertisement, or a copy  of  some  of  the
advertised posts. They are for a project manager, deputy  directors  and  an
assistant director. All we are doing here  today  is  just  rubber  stamping
what the Minister and the department have already decided. [Interjections.]

On Friday there was a robbery of pensioners' money  at  the  Meyerton  Civic
Centre payout point. Seven people, some with AK-47s, charged in  and  robbed
the paypoint. Fortunately the moneys were  reimbursed  within  three  hours,
but obviously the pensioners were  very  traumatised.  A  few  weeks  ago  a
runaway truck in KwaZulu-Natal ploughed into people at the side of the  road
- many of them pensioners collecting their pensions - killing 18 people.

It is high time we started looking at  the  Taylor  Report.  Then  we  might
transform the present and protect the future with such  things  as  improved
transfer of payments that will assist and improve the delivery to  the  most
vulnerable people in our society: children, the elderly, and the disabled.

Because these Bills are being shoved through Parliament with  such  alarming
speed, because they disregard the submissions and because  they  bypass  the
recommendations of the Taylor Report, the DA  unfortunately  cannot  support
them. [Applause.]

Mr E SALOOJEE: Chairperson, I think I should deviate from the speech that  I
was going to deliver, the reason being that hon Borman is trying to  suggest
that we did not respect the integrity of  the  process.  We  advertised  the
public  hearings  extensively.  Large  numbers  and   a   whole   range   of
organisations came to these hearings. We interacted  with  them  and  had  a
research team there. We carefully captured the proposals that were made.

Now, what I am saying is that the suggestion here is that we did  not  apply
our minds.

Mr M J ELLIS: It is no suggestion ...

Mr E SALOOJEE: The suggestion, irrespective of what you would say,  is  that
we upheld the integrity of that process. If your members  had  informed  you
properly, you would have realised that we did not subvert that  process  and
we did what we had to do.
So, finally, this  Bill  is  the  legitimate  outcome  of  what  we  wanted,
irrespective of what you say. [Applause.] Now, there is an  impression  that
we have seen the elections come and now the ANC  wants  to  introduce  this.
The whole notion of a new social security for our country goes  years  back,
right from the first days and you were reminded  that  there  was  a  Public
Service Commission and the Chikane Report that  looked  at  the  new  social
security system. One of the reasons we said we must try and complete this  -
it was not only said recently - was because we  felt  we  must  now  have  a
national social security system.

Now, it is within that context that I want to continue with  my  speech.  It
is well known to us that during the  apartheid  days  social  services  were
provided on a racial basis, which privileged some and discriminated  against
the majority of people in this country. When the ANC came to power  in  1994
we inherited a very disparate system. The disparities  included  inequitable
service provision, the  fragmentation  of  services  and  the  provision  of
services which failed to meet the needs of the people. We began  to  address
the situation as soon as possible but we encountered many  challenges,  some
of which must be highlighted.

Firstly, we were faced with 14 different systems which had to be  integrated
into one coherent and efficient system. The then Department  of  Health  and
Welfare had to confront the situation head-on and identify  as  one  of  its
most important priorities the phasing out of the inherited  inequalities  in
the social  welfare  programmes.  To  this  end  the  Department  of  Social
Development, as it is now known, released a White Paper for  Social  Welfare
in 1997 in order to set in place a system of developmental social welfare.

One of the other aims of the  White  Paper  was  to  reduce  the  fraud  and
corruption which was present in the social welfare system.  The  realignment
and amalgamation of Government departments also created  its  own  problems.
In many cases some provincial departments of  social  development  inherited
fully equipped offices and personnel who had a lack of capacity.
To this end, and to generally improve the  payment  of  social  grants,  the
Department  of  Social  Welfare  allowed  provinces   to   appoint   private
contractors to pay grants to recipients. These  contractors  performed  many
of their obligations satisfactorily, but it is an unfortunate  reality  that
there were very many instances in which some of these  contractors  did  not
perform to the standards expected by the department.

There was at least one  incident  in  which  a  contractor,  Cash  Paymaster
Services in the Eastern Cape, had to have its  contract  terminated  due  to
extremely poor service delivery. Despite these and  other  difficulties  our
Government managed to improve the lives of the poor in South Africa.

As our President correctly stated in one of his recent letters  on  the  ANC
website, the ANC-led Government has managed to make significant  inroads  in
the fight  against  poverty  through  improving  the  social  wages  of  the
country's poorest and an  increase  in  social  spending,  including  social
grants and access to social services like  education,  health  care,  water,
sanitation and housing.

The ANC-led Government has managed to  put  in  place  a  system  of  social
grants which is widely seen as one of  the  most  important  poverty  relief
measures in the country. In real terms this means that  our  Government  has
spent R34,8 billion on grants during 2003. Never  in  the  history  of  this
country has something like that been done.

Social grants are paid to close to 6 million  citizens  and  the  number  of
beneficiaries is likely to increase to approximately 9 million in  the  next
three years, taking into account the extension of this Child  Support  Grant
to gradually include children up to the age of 14 years.

The poor have been the greatest beneficiaries of  the  extension  of  social
grants. The poorest 20% of all households now  receive  the  largest  amount
from grants. The difference the grants make to the lives of these people  is
profound. It  is  estimated  that  without  the  social  grants  significant
numbers, that is about 55,9% of the elderly, would be living in poverty  and
an unacceptably high number of our elderly, that is about  38,2%,  would  be
living in conditions of extreme poverty.

One must also remember that the old  age  pension  is  often  also  used  to
support  entire  families.  The  Government's  ten-year  review,  which  was
released  recently,  states  that  social  grants  have  the  potential   to
substantially reduce the number of individuals living in  poverty  from  42%
to 24%. Although great progress has been  made  in  registering  recipients,
the full impact of these grants will only  be  realised  when  all  eligible
recipients are registered.

This seeming inability in the Department of Home Affairs to devise  a  fully
effective method of working with the Department of Social Development so  as
to provide identification documents to all those eligible to receive  grants
remains one of the most important factors inhibiting the payment  of  grants
to all our people in need.

Furthermore, the existing weaknesses in the  management  and  administration
of social grants often result in the failure on the part  of  Government  to
ensure that those entitled to benefits are provided with the  best  possible
services.  The  ANC-led  Government  recognises  that  we  would   have   to
substantially overhaul the system as millions of people who  are  unable  to
support themselves due to, for example,  unemployment,  disability  and  old
age, are relying on Government grants  as  the  only  form  of  income.  The
present system continues to be affected by a number of these problems.

In 2000 the President appointed a commission of inquiry to  investigate  the
social security system and to generate the final proposals with  respect  to
an improved  and  better  structured  social  security  system.  The  Taylor
Commission recommended, amongst others,  that  the  responsibility  for  the
delivery of social security should be removed from  the  provincial  to  the
national sphere of  government  and  that  the  eventual  administration  of
social security must be done by a national agency.
These  recommendations  were  seen  as  integral  parts  of  establishing  a
comprehensive social security system. The Taylor Report also  represented  a
further step in an ongoing process of intensive  research  into  the  policy
reforms necessary in the area  of  social  reform.  The  intentions  of  the
Social Assistance Bill and the South African  Social  Security  Agency  Bill
were neither to introduce  a  new  policy  nor  to  revamp  the  package  of
available social benefits.

These Bills are intended to overhaul the delivery system within  the  stated
existing policy. To suggest that the Bills were passed in a  policy  vacuum,
as is being done by some members of the opposition,  is  thus  opportunistic
and factually incorrect. I want to remind Mrs Borman that there is  a  whole
history behind it. It has nothing to  do  with  the  forthcoming  elections.
These things were planned and there has been ongoing work on developing  the
system.

The first step in our attempt to improve social delivery is the  new  Social
Assistance Bill, which aims to give effect to the  constitutional  right  to
have access to social security services, including  social  assistance.  The
most important consequences of this Bill will be the  eventual  transfer  of
the responsibility for  social  service  administration  and  delivery  from
provincial to national Government.

This will be done  to  ensure  that  the  same  minimum  standards  for  the
delivery of social  assistance  will  apply  across  the  country  and  will
hopefully ensure better service delivery to all the  people,  especially  in
the  remote  rural  areas.  The  Social  Assistance  Bill  aims  further  to
establish an  inspectorate  for  social  security,  which  will  investigate
fraud, corruption and other forms of financial and service mismanagement  as
part of its function so as to ensure the maintenance and  integrity  of  the
social security  systems.  This  inspectorate  will  be  very  important  in
improving service delivery  in  this  area,  as  it  will  help  combat  the
mismanagement, fraud and corruption which has been found in certain  sectors
of social service delivery.
The  other  important  aspect  is  that  our  Government  is  proud  of  the
improvement in service delivery in the area of social grants  and  payments,
and has therefore decided to  establish  a  faultless  specialised  delivery
mechanism to achieve this goal. The National  Social  Security  Agency  Bill
aims to establish such a mechanism to improve service delivery.

The main objective of the agency  would  be  to  ensure  the  efficient  and
effective  management,  administration  and  payment  of  social  assistance
grants in the country. This will  ensure  that  there  is  equal  access  to
social assistance for all citizens through  the  implementation  of  similar
standards and norms across the country. The removal of the payment  function
to the national agency will allow the Department of  Social  Development  to
place more emphasis on the developmental aspect of social security; that  is
to get involved in projects which go beyond the mere handing out of grants.

The Department of Social Development has stated  that  an  effective  social
security system would require it to move away from the traditional  approach
to designing and providing services that will lead to  self-sufficiency  and
sustainability. Such services would  include  programmes  such  as  poverty-
relief programmes aimed at providing wage-earning jobs to vulnerable  groups
such as women, children, the aged and the disabled.

The agency also aims to act as an agent for the payment of  other  forms  of
social  security.  The  Bill  also  makes  provision  for  negotiations  and
agreements to be entered into in this regard.  This  is  in  line  with  the
Government's mission to put in place a comprehensive system where all  forms
of social security,  both  social  insurance  and  assistance  payment,  are
managed by one body.

Allow me to dwell briefly on  the  potential  practical  implications  these
Bills may have. Foremost, proper implementation  will  give  effect  to  the
Batho Pele principles and allow recipients to be treated  with  the  dignity
and respect to which they are entitled.

Secondly, these Bills will place the  delivery  of  social  services  firmly
within the ambit of our President's statement on 8  January,  in  that  they
allow for conditions which will ensure the proper  functioning  of  our  ...
[Time expired.][Applause.]

Mrs I MARS: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues, the  two  Bills
before us  today  are  a  result  of  a  process  of  reassigning  important
competences from the provinces to the national sphere. And  it  is  on  this
basis that it is claimed they were wrongly assigned to  Proclamation  R7  of
1996.

One would have expected that the  MinMec  consultative  process  would  have
dealt with this matter in great detail and that agreement would  be  reached
at that level. At the portfolio committee we  did  question  the  department
and we were assured that this process had been concluded.

However, when we enquired about the Mashavhna case and looked at  the  court
document, we discovered that several provinces were actually respondents  in
the case originally. Now we understand clearly that the  judgment  had  been
given and that the reassignment was considered to be  correct.  We  have  to
accept this at this time and, therefore, we cannot find great  criticism  in
what the hon Minister said - and, certainly, not  in  what  our  chairperson
said - in terms of our desire and willingness to  improve  the  services  of
the social grant system to all our citizens who form a  vulnerable  part  of
our population. They deserve our consideration  and  I  don't  think  anyone
would disagree with that. I know a lot has been done and we  are  the  first
to acknowledge all that is positive that has happened.

Now at the same time we  are  also  aware,  of  course,  that  the  proposed
reversal of the 1996 proclamation has been a process that has been going  on
for a considerable time. And what I am actually going to highlight  is  only
the concerns we have regarding these changes. I must tell you honestly  that
we acknowledge that there were  many  teething  problems  and  many  serious
abuses due to the multiplicity of  systems.  There  is  justifiable  concern
about corruption, but we are not convinced  yet  that  the  Social  Security
Agency Bill constitutes a remedy to the problem unless  we  address  several
issues. We are told and assured that the process of implementation is  going
to be a very gradual one.

However, just looking at one item, namely the secondment  or  transfer  from
the Public Service to  the  agency,  we  find  that  it  raises  a  host  of
questions. And we have to remember that these officials  currently  employed
by the provincial governments have obviously  expressed  some  concern.  Now
the question that occurred to me of course was: Why the new  agency?  If  it
is to be more efficient, is it to be so much better  that  we  are  actually
seconding those employees or those civil servants, who are at the  moment  -
we  are  supposed  to  think  -  administering   matters   efficiently   and
competently? Because otherwise we would not second  and  transfer  them.  So
there are these many questions that are to be raised on the subject  of  the
Public  Service  employees  and  conditions  of  service,  the  differential
conditions of human resource policies and others.
From the Public Service employees'  point  of  view  we  would  need  to  be
informed of all the details such as, will they be able  to  refuse  transfer
or secondment to the agency and are conditions of employment the same?  Many
of these things were addressed, but from the Public Service  point  of  view
they have not been clearly answered. Are the benefits transferred? So  these
questions will arise and they will have to be considered in due  course.  We
are, however, even more concerned about the  transitional  arrangements  and
their consequences. What guarantees are there  to  ensure  that  the  social
service delivery is not adversely affected during the transitional period?

Then there's the question of the impact on existing provincial services  and
programmes, and the concerns about the transfers of assets  and  liabilities
from the provincial department to the agency, which  may  have  consequences
for social services not directly linked  to  the  administration  of  social
grants. The human resource function is to be located within the Ministry  of
Public Service and this, of course, brings out  concerns  for  many  of  the
Public Service employees who may be affected if this  process  is  going  to
lead to a loss of posts. We were assured,  during  the  portfolio  committee
discussion with the department,  that  this  Bill  will  merely  create  the
legislative framework for the agency, but we  are  not  quite  convinced  of
this.

On  the  Social  Assistance  Bill,  the  IFP  agrees  with   many   of   the
presentations made by organs of civil society and it is very interesting  to
see the diversity of this agency. There is the SA Council of  Churches,  the
Catholic Bishop's Conference, the Black Sash,  Cosatu,  Nehawu  and  several
others who expressed great concern over these  matters.  Cosatu  and  Nehawu
actually specifically  noted  that  there  was  not  enough  time  for  more
extended hearings.

We  also  agreed  with  the  presentation  that  stated  clearly  that   the
commission's report must be at the centre of  any  deliberation  to  achieve
the comprehensive social security policy. We believe that the policy  should
have emanated from  this  report  and  all  aspects  of  the  implementation
process should be deferred,  to  be  discussed  and  debated  widely  before
engaging in any legislative process. We're told that there  was  interaction
between the department and organs of civil society,  but  that  many  issues
raised were only partially accommodated or not at all.

The success of the Social Assistance Bill would depend to a large extent  on
civil society ... [Time expired.]

The IFP does not support the Bill. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, may I just  call  you  to
attention, please.  I  think  many  of  you  are  having  prolonged  private
conversations. If you could now attend to the main business of the House.

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Agb Adjunkvoorsitter, in die Beeld van  Maandag  10
November het die volgende berig verskyn:

Derduisende Suid-Afrikaners wat van maatskaplike toelaes afhanklik  is,  kan
nou hoop die administrasie sal meer toegeeflik wees.

Dit  kom  nadat  regter  Jerry  Shongwe  in  die  Pretoriase   hooggeregshof
uitspraak gegee het  in  die  aansoek  van  Muzamani  Samuel  Mashavhna,  'n
gestremde  van  Limpopo,  teen  die  president,  minister  van  maatskaplike
ontwikkeling en drie provinsiale LURs.

Albei Mashavhna se hande is in 'n motorongeluk in 1992 vergruis. Hy  het  in
2000 aansoek gedoen om 'n ongeskiktheidstoelae, maar moes soos meer  as  164
000 ander in Limpopo jare wag.

Mashavhna het in sy aansoek aangevoer die verskille  in  die  provinsies  se
hantering van maatskaplike toelaes is  ongrondwetlik  omdat  almal  nie  oor
dieselfde kam geskeer word nie.

Luidens hofstukke het die  president  in  1996  die  administrasie  van  die
maatskaplike toelaes aan die  provinsies  gegee  ingevolge  die  tussentydse
Grondwet.
Shongwe het hom gelyk gegee en gemaak of die proklamasie van  1996  ongeldig
is, maar dat dié bevel op 1  April  volgende  jaar  opgeskort  word  om  die
regering kans te gee om dit reg te stel.

Die hof het vroeër  gehoor  twee  wetsontwerpe  is  reeds  vroeër  deur  die
portefeuljekomitee vir maatskaplike ontwikkeling goedgekeur om die  probleem
op te los.

Dr Zola Skweyiya, as Minister van Maatskaplike  Ontwikkeling,  het  nie  die
aansoek   teengestaan   nie,   hoewel   die   LUR   vir   maatskaplike    en
bevolkingsontwikkeling  in  KwaZulu-Natal  die  aansoek  verbete  betwis  en
probeer het  om  dinge  te  hou  soos  dit  is.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Hon Chairperson, the following article was  run  in
the Beeld of Monday 10 November:


  Derduisende Suid-Afrikaners wat van maatskaplike  toelaes  afhanklik  is,
  kan nou hoop die administrasie sal meer toegeeflik wees.


  Dit kom nadat  regter  Jerry  Shongwe  in  die  Pretoriase  hooggeregshof
  uitspraak gegee het in die aansoek  van  Muzamami  Samual  Mashavhna,  `n
  gestremde van Limpopo, teen die president, die minister van  maatskaplike
  ontwikkeling en die provinsiale LURs.

Both of Mashavhna's hands were crushed in  a  motor  accident  in  1992.  He
applied for a disability grant in 2000 but, along  with  164 000  others  in
Limpopo, had to wait many years.

In his application Mashavnha  stated  that  differences  in  the  provinces'
handling of social grants were unconstitutional as everyone was not  treated
the same.

According to court documents the President gave the  administration  of  the
social grants to the provinces in accordance with the interim  Constitution.


Shongwe admitted that he was correct and pretended that the proclamation  of
1996 was invalid, but that this order would be  suspended  on  1  April  the
following year in order to give the Government the  opportunity  to  correct
it.

The court earlier heard that two Bills had  already  been  approved  by  the
Portfolio Committee for Social Development to solve the problem.

Dr Zola Skweyiya,  Minister  of  Social  Development,  did  not  oppose  the
application, although the  MEC  of  Social  and  Population  Development  in
KwaZulu-Natal fiercely contested the application and tried  to  keep  things
the way they were.]

This is one example where an individual in a specific province had to go  to
court in order to access a grant which would have been allocated to him  had
he lived in another province. I'm sure every  member  of  this  House  could
quote off-hand the name of at least  one  person  in  his  or  her  area  of
responsibility that has had the same kind of problem. The sad story in  this
case and in other cases like it is not due to a lack of willpower or a  lack
of commitment by the Minister to ensure that every person  in  this  country
who is  entitled  to  social  assistance  receives  such  support  from  the
Government.

The two Bills that we have in front of us today represent a further step  to
streamline the process, to ensure that every  person  in  South  Africa  has
access to social security, including the right to social assistance,  should
they be unable to support themselves and their dependants.

The weakness in the present administration and payment of social grants  has
provided those who are always  on  the  prowl  for  cheap  political  point-
scoring with an opportunity to criticise and  accuse  rather  than  to  find
solutions that would be sustainable, in order  to  improve  the  quality  of
life of the poorest of the poor, the elderly and the disabled. They  opt  to
wave newspaper ads here  in  Parliament,  rather  than  really  seeking  for
solutions to the problems. [Interjections.] For far too long  the  suffering
of those who were affected by a lack of uniformity in norms  and  standards,
which could be applied countrywide in the absence  of  constitutional  legal
requirements and reasons for social assistance, has provided  an  excuse  to
use the plight of such people  as  a  political  football.  Shame  on  those
people. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Carry on.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: The New  NP  believes  that  the  two  Bills  before
Parliament today will enable the Government and  the  department  to  render
such services as required to  take  care  of  those  whose  livelihoods  are
dependent on the monthly care given by the  state.  We  are  satisfied  that
both these Bills have as their  aim  the  improvement  of  services  to  the
needy. One of the objectives is to address the critical issues, such  as  to
provide for the financing of social assistance and  to  provide  for  proper
administration  and  payment   of   social   grants.   It   determines   the
qualification required for social  assistance,  as  well  as  ensuring  that
minimum norms and standards are set for the delivery of social assistance.

We believe that this legislation once again is  an  attempt  to  make  South
Africa a better place to live in by being  honest  when  we  find  that  the
processes that we are dealing with at  present  are  not  working  and  bold
enough to say that we need to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  rectify  and
improve such processes.

The New NP would support this. But  then,  in  the  final  analysis,  it  is
interesting to see that the unholy alliance that we have on the  left  here,
on two different debates today ... [Time expired.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Chairperson and the House at large, before  I  proceed  with
my speech, allow me to also add my  voice  in  responding  to  some  of  the
disparaging - or should I say desperate  -  remarks  from  the  hon  Borman,
which is characteristic of the DA during these  times  of  elections.  Those
remarks are desperate, since they know that  they  are  going  to  lose  the
elections and are therefore making remarks which are characteristic  of  the
DA. [Interjections.]

Contrary to what the hon Borman is saying, this is not  going  to  fail  the
poor, the elderly and children: it is only the DA that stands to  lose  from
the passing of this  legislation.  This  legislation  is  going  to  achieve
nothing other than to improve the quality of life of our people.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: What is going to change?

[Mr M T MASUTHA: Chairperson and members of this honourable House, the  Bill
before us today  is  important  as  we  are  approaching  10  years  of  our
democratic Government.

It is time for us to reflect on where we come from to see if  the  lives  of
the  people  have  indeed  been  changed  since  1994,  when  apartheid  was
eradicated. You may recall that  when  the  ANC  came  into  power  in  1994
pension administration was divided in line with apartheid policies.

Black people were staying in homelands like Gazankulu, Lebowa, etc, and  did
not receive the same pension as their white counterparts residing in the so-
called ``real'' South Africa. This  was  specifically  done  so  that  black
people would never develop to the extent that they were the same  as  people
of other race groups.

Since  the  ANC-led  Government  has  taken  over  there  have   been   some
significant changes in the lives of our people, more especially the  quality
of life of black people has improved. This  fact  is  supported  by  figures
that one gets from Statistics South Africa, which indicate that  the  number
of people who received pension grants in 1994 when the  ANC  took  over  was
2,6 million, but now the number has increased to 6,8 million. These  figures
also show that in 1994 money allocated for social grants  was  R10  billion,
which has increased to R34,8 billion in this year.

The main aim of these Bills presented to us  today  is  to  improve  on  the
administration of social grants so that the needs of all our people  can  be
met, whether they are from urban or rural areas.]

Turning to some of the specific issues relating  to  the  Bills  before  us,
allow me to start by  saying  that  these  Bills  seek  to  consolidate  and
centralise the  administration  of  social  assistance,  so  as  to  promote
equitable access in line with both the equality  clause  and  the  right  to
social security provisions in our Bill of Rights.

May I at this juncture also bring to the attention of  the  House  the  High
Court judgment which was already alluded to in the Mashavhna case  recently,
delivered on 28 October 2003. In this  case  the  constitutionality  of  the
assignment of the social assistance function to  the  provincial  sphere  of
government was successfully challenged.

Concern was expressed by civil society regarding the  introduction  of  this
legislation when this matter was still before the courts. The  view  of  the
committee was that the location of the  function  was  a  policy  matter  in
respect of which Government, in its wisdom, deemed appropriate to deal  with
in the Bill before us, namely,  by  providing  for  its  relocation  to  the
national sphere of government.

At the same time provision is made for  a  single  nationally  based  social
security agency to become, once it is fully fledged,  the  sole  agency  for
the payment  of  grants  throughout  the  country.  This  will  obviate  the
prevailing situation in which the payment of grants is performed by  various
subcontractors engaged by the different  provinces.  This  has  resulted  in
uneven standards of service delivery, as the Minister  has  already  alluded
to, and therefore inconsistencies in the administration of payments  between
provinces.

Let me also clarify that, contrary to what Ms  Borman  alluded  to  earlier,
the agency has not been created and therefore no posts have been  advertised
by the agency. The posts that were advertised were  within  the  department.
So,  stop  misleading  the  public  about   facts   that   do   not   exist.
[Interjections.]

Transitional  arrangements  were  carefully  crafted  in   line   with   the
principles of co-operative governance  contained  in  our  Constitution,  to
ensure a smooth transition from the current arrangements  wherein  provinces
are responsible for the provision of grants to the  new  arrangements  under
the proposed legislation in terms of  which  the  national  sphere  will  be
responsible.

I also wish  to  clarify  that  the  executive  functions  of  the  Minister
regarding the overall provision of social grants is clearly  spelt  out  and
is distinct from  the  administrative  functions  to  be  performed  by  the
agency, which are also clearly spelt out in the proposed legislation.

Several issues were raised relating to  the  character  of  the  new  agency
during the committee's deliberations on the South  African  Social  Security
Agency Bill, which I now wish to address. Firstly, the question  of  whether
the agency should have original statutory powers or  should  rather  perform
such  functions  in  a  delegated  capacity  was  raised.  Having  carefully
considered the matter, the committee was of the view  that  the  delineation
of the executive and the administrative functions I have already alluded  to
was necessary to enhance  accountability  under  the  overall  institutional
arrangements.

Secondly, the committee was of the view that  the  administrative  functions
which, under the current legislation, are performed by the  director-general
or the head of the department of social development at provincial level,  as
the case may be,  should  be  conferred  directly  on  the  agency  and  not
indirectly through delegation from the director-general to the agency.

The latter  approach,  the  committee  felt,  would  create  an  undesirable
dualism in accountability between the director-general of the department  on
the one hand and the CEO of the agency on the other. This  could  result  in
the  director-general  being  finally  accountable  as  accounting  officer,
whilst he or she does not  at  the  same  time  exercise  control  over  the
affairs of the agency.

The issue of a board to be established as a governing body for  the  agency,
through which the agency would account to the  Minister,  was  also  mooted.
The  prevailing  view,  however,  was  that  the  CEO  should  be   directly
accountable to and under the control of the Minister, so as to  shorten  the
chain of accountability.

Another issue which was  the  subject  of  extensive  deliberation  was  the
policy question whether the agency  should  be  located  within  the  Public
Service Regulatory Framework or whether it should fall  within  the  broader
public sector institutional arrangements.  Various  models,  such  as  Sars,
were used to determine the  appropriate  location  of  the  agency  in  this
regard and in the final analysis  the  agency  was  placed  outside  of  the
Public Service but within the public sector.

As a result, it was the decision of the  committee  to  insert  subclause  3
under clause 7 of the Bill to provide for the Minister,  after  consultation
with the CEO of the agency, to determine a code of conduct  for  the  agency
to ensure, amongst other things, effective and  efficient  service  delivery
based on  professional  ethics;  prevention  of  a  conflict  of  interests;
confidentiality; honest, impartial, fair  and  equitable  service;  and  the
promotion and protection of the human dignity  of  the  applicants  and  the
beneficiaries of social security.

In addition and in consultation with the Minister for  the  Public  Service,
the Minister would determine an appropriate human resource  policy  for  the
agency. This would obviously be benchmarked  within  the  framework  of  the
broader Public Service Regulatory Framework. This is aimed at ensuring  that
a new ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs  R  M  SOUTHGATE:  Chairperson,  South   Africa   faces   insurmountable
challenges in the fight to  alleviate  poverty.  The  Constitution  provides
everyone, adults and children, with the  right  to  have  access  to  social
security and social assistance.  However,  the  number  of  people  becoming
dependent on the state is growing at an alarming rate.

Section 28(1)(b) of the Constitution implies that parents have  the  primary
responsibility to provide economic and social  rights  for  their  children,
and the state must only intervene when parents are  unable  to  provide  for
them.

The SA Social Security Agency  Bill  provides  an  institution  designed  to
improve and enhance delivery of service  to  6  million  beneficiaries.  The
lack of fiscal management and political leadership  by  provinces  does  not
warrant the shift by centralising this competency, but it  does  reveal  the
present Government's ideology by slowly eroding the powers of provinces.

Insecurity and uncertainty amongst current personnel could result in  losing
experienced and qualified employees.  The  challenge  remains  whether  this
agency would have the human capacity and skills  to  administer  and  manage
the transitional phase without prejudicing existing and new beneficiaries.

The Social Assistance  Bill  attempts  to  produce  a  comprehensive  social
package, with particular  attention  to  children,  disability,  health  and
retirement. Given the  fact  that  the  department  loses  approximately  R2
billion a year, the swift establishment of the inspectorate must be seen  as
a vital component to prevent fraud and corruption,  financial  mismanagement
and criminal activity within the social grant system.

The amount of R34 billion disbursed at a rate of R2,9 billion a month,  with
a yearly increase of 8% in the medium  term,  is  unsustainable.  Government
must ensure that it creates an enabling environment that will stimulate  the
economy for sustainable job creation, and by so  doing  decrease  dependency
and incorporate the workforce back into the economic stream.

Furthermore, Government must  guard  against  allowing  social  services  to
become a tool to build itself a power base  at  the  expense  of  the  poor.
[Time expired.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Deputy Chair, hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the  South
African Social Security Agency Bill and the Social Assistance Bill  seek  to
usher  in  a  new  management  dispensation  for  the  provision  of  social
assistance by Government.

The establishment of the Social Security Agency  and  the  Inspectorate  for
Social  Assistance  will  hopefully   address   the   urgent   problems   of
mismanagement and abuse within  the  current  social  security  institution.
Within these dozens of pages of legislation and their implementation,  there
is a harsh reality for the intended beneficiaries.  It  is  ridiculous  that
elderly people die in queues, beneficiaries  wait  months  for  payment  and
that they are deprived of their grants unilaterally.

On top of these unacceptable and, sadly so, prevalent  incidents,  there  is
the  continuous  spectre  of  corruption  and  fraud  that  seeks  to  steal
taxpayers' money intended for the poor and needy. It  is  a  crime  of  such
despicable proportions that the  maximum  jail  sentence  of  15  years,  as
prescribed in the Bill, seems almost inadequate.
It is our sincere  hope  that  the  inspectorate  envisaged  in  the  Social
Assistance Bill  will  be  equipped  and  staffed  to  such  a  degree  that
corruption and greed can be eradicated from social  security  once  and  for
all.

In conclusion, the existence of legislation in and of itself  means  nothing
to the millions of poor and needy people if political  will  and  unwavering
dedication to the task is lacking in Government and the Public Service.  The
real test for this legislation is  whether  it  can  translate  quickly  and
efficiently into a proper  service  delivery  vehicle  that  alleviates  the
suffering that we see across the country.

The UDM supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI:  Sihlalo,  Mphathiswa  wezoPhuhliso  loLuntu  noogxa  bakho,
iNdlu ngokubanzi, lo ngumhla omkhulu  kubantu  abasivotelayo,  silapha  nje;
umhla oya kuhlala uyimbali, mhla kwathiwa thaca  kwinkundla  yowiso-mithetho
iMithetho eYilwayo engamawele ngaxeshanye. Ubuwele bobu,  omnye  akanakwenza
ngaphandle komnye. Xa usithi ``Social Security Agency  Bill''  unyanzelekile
ukuba uthi  ``Social  Assistance  Bill''.  Ngamawele,  ayakhaphana.  [Uwele-
wele.]

Iingxaki ezathi  zagubungela  uluntu  malunga  nokunatyiselwa  kwezibonelelo
eluntwini, zenza  uRhulumente  okhokelwa  nguKhongolose  wangalali  buhlayo,
ngakumbi uKrec'  izulu,  uLeta,  ezama-zamana  neendlela  zokukhupha  abantu
kwintlungu yendlala, intlupheko nentswelo-misebenzi.

Phaya emaphandleni kuxhalatywa ngakumbi xa kusiza imini  yepeyi.  Izolo  oku
izikrelemnqa zihluthe i-1,2 yezigidi zeerandi  kufuphi  naseNgqeleni,  i-1,6
yezigidi zeerandi eMtata, isigidi  seerandi  ngaseFlagstaff,  kanti  ama-300
000 eerandi  ahluthwe  ngaseDebe  Nek.  Iyonke  le  mali  sisi-4,1  sezigidi
zeerandi, mali leyo ebiyabelwe ukususa ikati eziko.

Ukubethwa ngemf' iphindiwe yimibutho emibini, u-Cash Paymaster Services  no-
All Pay, eyabelwa  ukusondeza  izibonelelo  zikaRhulumente  eluntwini  itsho
uluntu lwabambelela esidleleni,  lwaphelelwa  lithemba.  Le  mibutho  mibini
ilukhwankqisile uluntu.  Yaleke  iingxaki  phezu  kweengxaki  ezifana  nezi:
ukufika ukutshona kwelanga kwiindawo ekwamkeliswa  kuzo,  imingcelele  emide
abantu  belambile,  ukugqatswa   lilanga   empengempengeni   bengenamithunzi
nendawo yokusithela xa limathumb'  antaka.  UKufela  komntu  emgceni  kwenza
urhulumente wephondo leMpuma Koloni wathabathela u-CPS amanye amanyathelo.

Ewe, masivane ukuba ukuziswa kwezibonelelo  eluntwini  kuyahluka  kumaphondo
olithoba.  Kwamanye  amaphondo  siyancoma,  kwamanye  sigxeka  sincoma.   Xa
kusaziwa  ukuba  siyeza  siyiKomiti  yoPhuhliso   loLuntu   siyalungiselelwa
siboniswe iindawo ezicwangciselwe thina. Siye ke xa  kunje  siphume  ecaleni
sicele ukusiwa kwiindawo ezikhethwe sithi. Hayi ke,  uya  kuzandisela  esiye
sifike sikubone - intlungu  nentlupheko  ebhalwe  ebusweni  babantu.  Uncumo
oluye lusihlangabeze bakuva abantu  ukuba  siphuma  kundlunkulu  eKapa.  Olu
ncumo luqulethe ithemba lokuba size kubakhulula emakhamandeleni  entlupheko.
Le Mithetho iYilwayo mibini ke izalisekisa ikwafezekisa elo themba.
Ngale  ntsasa  sivuka  nezinye   ezikwambethe   ezi   ntsizana   zixhomekeke
kwizibonelelo zikaRhulumente. Phaya eBhizana, kumntla-mpuma  Koloni,  abantu
baphucwe  ama-45  000  eerandi  kwaze  kwathatyathwa  nezazisi  zabo.   Siva
kwangabo  ukuba  ukuze  bayifumane  inkamnkam  okanye  isibonelelo  kufuneka
barhume ama-280 eerandi.

Izinto  ezikumila  kunje  zenze  ukuba  undlunkulu,  iNdlu   yoWiso-mthetho,
athabathele  kuye  uxanduva  lokusa  ngqo  ebantwini  iinkonzo   ezingundoqo
nempilo  eluntwini,  ukuze  luxhamle  ubomi  obububo.  Isimbonono  esivakala
nasebuthongweni  sisuka  kumazantsi  esisu  kwabo  bachatshazelwa  ziinkonzo
ezihesheheshe zibangela ukuba uKrec' izulu avakalelwe, anyanzelise ukuba  le
Mithetho iYilwayo ize ngaphambili ukuze kuphele isijwili.

Ezi  Bhili  zimbini  ziphambi  kwethu  zizalisekisa   amalungelo   angundoqo
akuMqulu waMalungelo oLuntu. Kudalwa iarhente, i-SA Social Security  Agency,
eya kuqwalasela ukulawulwa nokuhlawulwa kwezibonelelo  eluntwini  kwanezinye
iinkonzo ezayamene noko.

Ngale ndlela uMphathiswa weSebe loPhuhliso loLuntu uthabathele kuye  ulawulo
nentlawulo. Owona msebenzi ungundoqo wale arhente kukulawula  nokuqinisekisa
ngokufaneleka nokungafaneleki kwezibonelelo zomceli  ngamnye,  ukuze  ngaloo
ndlela kuliwe  ukuhliswa  ngemilenze  kweemali  zikaRhulumente.  Le  arhente
inokwenza  isivumelwano  nezinye  iinkampani   ezifuna   ukuncedisa,   kodwa
kufuneka iqiniseke ukuba loo nkampani iya  kuwenza  lo  msebenzi  ngenyameko
nokuzimisela.

UMphathiswa  uya  kuncediswa  kulo  msebenzi  ngokuthi   azichongele   igosa
elifanelekileyo eliya kuthi lilawule le  arhente,  i-CEO  ngokwasemlungwini.
Eli gosa liphantsi koMphathiswa  ngqo,  nelenza  intando  yakhe,  nalo  liya
kuqesha abancedisi abazinikeleyo kumsebenzi  wabo.  Iinjongo  zale  nquleqhu
kukuzama ukuphucula iinkonzo ezayamene nezibonelelo eluntwini.

Umbono kaRhulumente kukuba le arhente  ibe  sisikhululo  sokugqibela,  kodwa
ukuze eli phulo libe yimpumelelo, kufuneka intsebenziswano phakathi  kweSebe
loPhuhliso  loLuntu  neSebe  leMicimbi  yezeKhaya.  Aba  Baphathiswa  babini
kufuneka   belele   ngangubonye.   Akukho   mntu   unokufumana   isibonelelo
sikaRhulumente ngaphandle kwesazisi.

Ukungasebenzisani kakuhle kwala masebe kuko okudala iingxaki ebantwini.  Aba
Baphathiswa bobabini  basePitoli  kundlunkulu,  izigqibo  maziphakwe  zifike
ebantwini ziseshushu. UMthetho oYilwayo onxulumene  nezibonelelo  eluntwini,
i-Social Assistance Bill, uzisiphula neengcambu  izenzo  ezigwenxa  zokuzama
ukuhlisa ngemilenze izibonelelo zabantu.

Lo Mthetho  uYilwayo  ukwabonelela  iimbedlenge  ezithi  zishiywe  enyanyeni
ngulowo ebezamkelela. Iarhente inalo igunya  lokutyumba  omnye  umntu  ukuba
amkelele loo mbedlenge.  Akukho  mntu  omakagoduke  engaphethanga  nto  kuba
kungekho mntu wakumnceda.
Ingxaki yokuba  umntu  ebefuna  isibonelelo,  suka  axelelwe  emgceni  ukuba
isibonelelo  sakhe  siphelile,  kwanento  yokurhuma  amagosa   kaRhulumente,
incothulwe neengcambu.  Urhwaphilizo  lofa  namthanyana.  Iimali  ziya  kuya
kubantu ababelwe zona. Liya kunina. Masiguqukele  kubavoti  ngelithi:  Ingwe
idla  ngamabala.  Niyayibona  imisebenzi  kaKhongolose  kule   minyaka   nje
ilishumi. Kucace okwekati emhlophe ehlungwini ukuba lo Rhulumente  ukhokelwa
yi-ANC usaya kude neli lizwe.

Uphuhliso loluntu  yeyona  nto  ingundoqo  kuRhulumente.  Ukugxotha  indlala
nokudala amathuba emisebenzi  zezona  zithembiso  kubantu  abasemaphandleni.
Mgwebe  umntu  ngakuthembise  kona  waza  akakwenza.  Ncoma  akufezekisileyo

(Translation of Xhosa speech follows.)

[Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, hon Minister of Social  Development  and  your
colleagues, the House at large, this is an important day to the  people  who
voted us in here; a  historic  day  on  which  twin  Bills  were  introduced
simultaneously in the National Assembly. They are twins in  the  sense  that
the one cannot work without the  other.  When  you  say:  ``Social  Security
Agency Bill'', you have to say: ``Social Assistance Bill''. They are  twins,
and they go together. [Interjections.]
The problems encountered in the process of extending grants  to  the  people
gave the leaders in  the  ANC-led  Government  sleepless  nights,  with  the
Minister trying his level best to deliver people from  hunger,  poverty  and
unemployment.

People in the rural areas are anxious on the  eve  of  the  pension  payout.
Just yesterday robbers got  away  with  R1,2  million  near  Ngqeleni,  R1,6
million in Umtata, R1 million near Flagstaff, and R300 000  near  Debe  Nek.
All this money, which comes to a total of R4,1 million,  was  allocated  for
poverty eradication.

The deception of the two companies, Cash Paymaster  Services  and  All  Pay,
which were entrusted with distributing Government grants among  the  people,
has left the people dumbfounded and despondent.  These  two  companies  have
disappointed the people. They have brought with  them  additional  problems,
such as: arriving late at the paypoint,  people  standing  in  long  queues,
hungry and exposed to elements such as heat and rain, without  any  shelter.
The death of a pensioner in a queue prompted the government of  the  Eastern
Cape to take action against CPS.

Yes, let us agree that the distribution of Government grants to  the  people
varies from province to province. In some provinces it is  commendable,  and
in others not so bad. When we pay  visits  as  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Social Development, we are often taken to places specially prepared for  us.
In such cases we usually ask to be taken to places chosen  by  us.  Well,  I
leave the rest to your imagination - the  pain  and  suffering  written  all
over people's faces. The people suddenly smile when they hear  that  we  are
from the national Parliament. These smiles signify the  people's  hope  that
we are going to deliver them from the shackles of poverty. These  two  Bills
represent the fulfilment of that hope.

This morning we woke up  to  some  disturbing  news  concerning  these  poor
people who depend on Government grants. We got the news that at Bhizana,  in
the north-eastern part of the Eastern Cape, people were robbed  of  R45  000
and of their IDs. They also told us that in order to get their  grants  they
had to pay R280,00.

These events have prompted the national department to take upon  itself  the
responsibility of distributing essential services direct to  the  people  so
that they can enjoy a better life. The poignant  cries  of  helplessness  by
those affected by this ineffective service touched the  Minister  of  Social
Development,  so  much  so  that  he  demanded  that  these  two  Bills   be
introduced.

The two Bills before us are a fulfilment of the basic rights in the Bill  of
Rights. An agency is being created, the SA  Social  Security  Agency,  which
will handle the administration and payment of grants to the people  as  well
as dealing with related services.

In this way the Minister of Social Development has taken  upon  himself  the
responsibility for the administration and payment of grants. The  main  task
of this agency is to administer and consider  applications  for  grants,  in
order to prevent the embezzlement of  Government  moneys.  This  agency  can
come into agreement with other companies, but it has to make sure  that  the
company it comes into agreement with will carry out its mandate  efficiently
and diligently.

The Minister will appoint an official  he  deems  suitable  to  manage  this
agency, in other words a CEO. This official, who  reports  directly  to  the
Minister and does his bidding, will also appoint dedicated  people  to  help
him. All  this  is  done  in  an  effort  to  improve  services  related  to
Government grants.

Government's view is that this agency should be the last port of  call,  but
in order for this to  happen  there  has  to  be  co-operation  between  the
Departments of Social Development and of  Home  Affairs.  The  Ministers  of
these two departments have to work closely. Nobody can receive a  Government
grant without an ID.

Lack of co-operation between these two departments causes problems  for  the
people. Both Ministers are based in  Pretoria,  therefore  decisions  should
filter down to the people without  delay.  The  Social  Assistance  Bill  is
meant to uproot any attempts to embezzle Government grants.

This Bill also provides for the invalids who are left in the lurch by  those
who were getting grants on their behalf. The agency  has  the  authority  to
appoint a person to get a grant on their  behalf.  No  one  should  go  home
empty-handed because there was no one to help.

The fact that somebody who has been getting a grant is  told  in  the  queue
that his or her grant has been withdrawn,  and  the  bribing  of  Government
officials, are things of the past. The days of corruption are numbered.  The
moneys will go to those for whom they were intended.  Let  us  turn  to  the
voters and say: Be the judge. You have seen  the  achievements  of  the  ANC
over the past 10 years. It is crystal  clear  that  the  ANC-led  Government
will take this country further.

People development is priority number one for  the  Government.  We  promise
poverty alleviation and the creation of job opportunities for people in  the
rural areas. Judge a person by what he or she has promised  you  and  failed
to deliver. Praise him or her for what he or  she  promised  and  delivered.
Let plenteousness and richness prevail over  poverty,  so  that  people  can
stop going to sleep on empty stomachs. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, the Bill seeks to  give
effect to what the President of the Republic said on  the  occasion  of  his
state of the nation address. He stated that a social security  agency  would
be established this year. At the time we in the UCDP, though not  averse  to
the agency, cautioned that the Public Service should be lean and  mean,  and
not compounded with more bureaucrats.

The rampant looting of money from vulnerable  people  by  some  unscrupulous
officers has  seen  us  meeting  our  Damascus  and  supporting  the  urgent
establishment of the agency. Corruption and mismanagement of  social  grants
in the provinces calls for a more hands-on  and  hawk-like  agency  to  deal
with all grants. Only last night we saw on national  television  how  people
in Bizana and Lusikisiki continue to  abuse  the  trust  given  to  them  by
Government. This cannot be allowed to go  any  further.  A  national  social
security agency has to be  put  in  place  to  obviate  disparities  in  the
payment of grants in the provinces.

We have noted the ruling by Justice Shongwe to  the  effect  that  provinces
should not have been allowed to handle social grants in the first place.  We
hope the Constitutional Court will uphold the  ruling.  The  hope  is  that,
once established  and  operating,  the  agency  will  serve  the  needy  and
deserving people honestly. There should be no room  for  the  current  stock
borrowers in the envisaged agency.

The  establishment  of  the  inspectorate  for  social  assistance  is  most
welcome, as they would be able to nip some of the indiscretions in the  bud.
We hope the agency will work closely with other state  organs  such  as  the
Department of Home Affairs in requesting the fast-tracking  of  the  issuing
of identity documents to people who qualify for grants.

We in the UCDP appreciate all the Minister is doing in  fighting  corruption
and fraud in all their facets. He has proved to be hands-on  and  procedural
in dealing with deviant officers, like he  did  with  CEO  of  the  National
Development Agency.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member!

Mr I S MFUNDISI: The UCDP will support the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: And order  to  the  members  again.  I
think   you   are   once   again   indulging   in   private   conversations.
[Interjections.] Order, hon members!

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chairperson, the MF is pleased with the  undertaking
in this Bill, that is, making  the  underprivileged  and  those  in  need  a
priority. Often these people are made to feel like nobody cares and  the  MF
is proud of our Government for making an effort to represent  the  needs  of
all its people with no reservation.  Our  aim  of  eradicating  poverty  and
stimulating social development is strengthened by Bills such as these.

Social security services for the less fortunate provide a glimmer  of  hope.
However, as noted, the system does have its loopholes, which  provisions  to
this Bill aim to fix. The MF feels that the introduction of  the  SA  Social
Security Agency shall be of great benefit to the enhancement and  management
of social delivery.  Our  people  do  not  deserve  and  cannot  afford  the
disappointment of failed service delivery as  it  was  under  the  apartheid
government, when social grants were paid in different  scales  to  different
races.

It is our duty to ensure that social  services  are  delivered  effectively,
efficiently and evenly. The MF feels that  every  effort  must  be  made  to
ensure this. The MF has no objections to provisions made  in  terms  of  the
Minister in the Social Assistance Bill. It is felt that a system  should  be
rendered to the Minister at the best of the  department's  ability.  Further
support is given to the similar provision made for the  director-general  in
respect of social assistance.

The MF notes the cumbersome task and supports the assistance  to  be  given.
No  objection  is  given  to  provisions  made  for  persons  who  in  these
circumstances have been delegated powers.  Further  clarity  and  provisions
provided in terms of regulation and repeal of  legislation  have  been  well
compiled for efficient management. The MF supports the South African  Social
Security Bill and Social Assistance Bill. Thank you, Deputy Chairperson.

Mr M L DA CAMARA: Chairperson,  millions  of  people  in  South  Africa  are
totally dependent on a social grant,  making  these  pieces  of  legislation
some of the most important which this House will pass this year.  Reform  of
the way services are rendered to beneficiaries and improvement of the  types
of grants they receive are long overdue and, therefore, welcome.

But we are looking at the final products before us today. It must  be  noted
that these two Bills achieve neither. Instead  of  bringing  in  appropriate
reform,  including  the  improvement  of  information  management  and   the
extension of options to beneficiaries, the  South  African  Social  Security
Agency Bill at best only brings uncertainty and  the  perpetuation  of  poor
services that people experience or, at worst,  jeopardises  the  receipt  of
grants by the most vulnerable people in our society.

The department was unable to assure the committee that the  introduction  of
the agency would bring real changes on the ground. Important questions  such
as, ``Will the same people who provide poor services at present continue  in
their posts?'' and ``Will the  same  cumbersome  information  in  management
systems  remain?''  were  not  answered.  Should  this  be  the  case,  then
beneficiaries can expect no changes at all.

Poor conception of the envisaged changes runs the risk of letting  down  the
very people the system set out to serve. Let us be  reminded,  hon  members,
of the last time  the  department  undertook  an  overhaul  of  the  system.
Hundreds of  thousands  of  beneficiaries  went  without  their  grants  for
months, and in some instances for over a year. This led to  untold  hardship
and misery. It should not be  allowed  to  happen  again.  An  ill-conceived
change which takes place without challenging those problems  on  the  ground
that create inefficiencies runs the risk of preventing people  from  getting
their desperately needed grants.

Many questions go unanswered when it comes  to  how  this  will  affect  the
provinces. It has been well documented  that  the  welfare  and  development
services in  provinces  are  not  what  they  should  be.  Due  to  resource
constraints,  it  is   understandable   that   provinces   use   the   grant
administration system to support the little that they can provide  in  terms
of welfare services. What will happen to the  infrastructure,  capacity  and
resources needed by social workers to administer the foster care  system  so
as to attend to children at risk and assess children in  conflict  with  the
law, should this go through?

Show me an MP in this House who does not know about the problems  of  child-
headed households and street children, then I will show you an MP who  lives
on a different planet; perhaps the same planet  that  the  Government  lives
on. [Interjections.]

The HIV/Aids pandemic has left our country with the  tragedy  of  large  and
growing numbers of children affected by the disease. This  has  forced  many
children to become adults in their own families or move  onto  the  streets.
In these Bills, Government has chosen to turn a blind eye to  this  terrible
reality, completely ignoring what the facts on  the  ground,  civil  society
and common sense tell us - that the number of vulnerable children will  grow
into millions in the near future because of  the  pandemic.  Yet  Government
refuses to acknowledge this. Instead, the Social Assistance  Bill  makes  it
impossible  for  children  living  in   child-headed   households   in   the
communities most affected by Aids to access the grants  -  the  same  grants
that this Bill entitles them to.

Street children and the  NGOs  that  attempt  to  help  them  are  similarly
disregarded and abandoned by the state. To say that the Children's Bill  now
before Parliament will deal with these issues is to be, at the  very  least,
disingenuous. The original  Bill,  painstakingly  crafted  over  five  years
through thorough consultation,  has  been  totally  emasculated,  abandoning
children to a terrible fate. By choosing not to  make  provision  for  these
children, despite the state having  the  capacity  to  contribute  to  those
children's brighter future, Government has condemned  these  children  to  a
dim future without hope and our country to potential instability brought  on
by growing numbers of neglected children. What a terrible shame!

It is with immense sadness that the DA cannot  support  these  Bills.  Thank
you.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Deputy Chairperson, hon Ministers and hon members,  humility
and confidence are two sides of the same coin. In the ANC we  are  not  only
confident about our mandate, which was given to  us  by  the  electorate  in
1999, we are  also  prepared  to  carry  out  this  mandate  with  humility.
[Applause.]

These two Bills are once again proof that we are still on  course  regarding
our mandate to create a better life for all and to push back  the  frontiers
of poverty. The same Bills are also evidence of our humility,  which  allows
us, the ANC, to take stock of  our  performance  at  regular  intervals.  We
regularly do that. It shows our preparedness  to  acknowledge  shortcomings,
as well as our efforts to improve on such shortcomings. That is the ANC.

The Bills we are debating today are part  of  the  efforts  by  the  ANC-led
Government to improve on some of  the  shortcomings  identified  in  service
delivery. All the members who have been coming here have  alluded  to  these
challenges. However, it is necessary to point out that, prepared as  we  are
to engage in self-improvement and self-criticism, we  are  equally  vigilant
concerning destructive, or rather detracting criticism. We  are  aware  that
some of the criticisms towards these Bills are not genuine.

If we had put a comprehensive, new Child Care Act here addressing all  these
issues that the hon members are raising, we would still  be  criticised.  If
we had not tabled any Bills, yes, the hon members would have a  tool  to  go
to the electorate and say, ``There was never any Bill.''  We  are  aware  of
such detracting moves. We are very aware of them. Do not think  that  we  do
not see them. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: There is a Bill now, but it is very bad.
Ms N M TSHEOLE: Hon members, much as the hon members on  my  left-hand  side
can say whatever they want to say, we are aware  that  they  are  trying  to
detract us. We are not going to allow them to detract us  from  our  course.
[Interjections.]

People who have never lived in poverty will not understand  why  a  homeless
person, when he or she is about to build a house, erects  a  shack  next  to
that. People who have never lived in poverty, when they build  houses,  rent
a flat whilst the house is being constructed. [Applause.] A poor person  can
rather go and buy prefabs, use the money  to  live  in  a  sheltered  place,
which is a shack, whilst constructing his home.

This is what we are doing. Do we have  to  leave  people  in  the  open,  in
exposure and say that as long as we  do  not  have  a  comprehensive  social
security system, as long as we do not have a comprehensive Child  Care  Act,
we are not going to have any other Bill to do certain things? We  are  aware
of the problems. We are aware of the child-headed  households.  Some  of  us
grew up alone in our homes when our mothers and fathers were  domestics.  We
had child-headed households. [Applause.]

It is unfortunate that the hon  members  are  only  now  becoming  aware  of
children heading households.  We  have  been  heading  households  when  our
mothers were domestics in the urban areas.  [Applause.]  It  is  not  a  new
concept. Here we are, we are now representatives. I am  going  to  speak  to
our electorate and, unfortunately, I have not arranged for interpretation.

Bagaetsho, ga re le latlhelele matsogo. Re a itse gore  bana  e  sala  e  le

follows.)

[Ladies and gentlemen, we are not abandoning you. We know that children  are
left as orphans, and we know that this is not for the  first  time  for  the
children to be left as orphans. We appeal to the people who live with  these
children by saying that they should not leave them; the Government is  there
to support them. As for those who come to you and say that we should pass  a
law that looks after our orphans, we do not care about such people and  they
are not telling the truth. You know that they were also  against  the  child
support grant when we started it.]

I remember in 1998, when we introduced the child support  grant,  there  was
lots of talk. This is not new. Do not be distracted. This is not new.  There
were times when they said to our people:


  During the apartheid era we were getting R135, now the ANC says that  the
  children will  get  R100.  Are  they  implying  that  children  who  were
  privileged are better than children who were disadvantaged?

This is a known fact, you  used  to  say  that.  We  are  not  going  to  be
distracted. We are going ahead with these  two  Bills,  because  we  want  a
better life for all. In our policy we say, Batho Pele. We put people  first,
so there is no way we can be distracted.

The two Bills, as it has already been indicated here,  are  a  step  towards
the implementation of the Taylor Committee's report.  I  am  surprised  that
here they avoided mentioning the basic income grant, because they have  been
pushing  for  the  comprehensive  implementation  of  the  Taylor  Committee
Report; they wanted to hang onto the big basic income grant. It is  not  the
case. We are aware of the motives. We can read between the lines.

The other thing, with regard to the monitoring, is  that  we  know  that  we
have had all the  grants.  The  Social  Assistance  Bill,  as  it  has  been
mentioned,  introduces  the  inspectorate  that  is  going  to  monitor  the
delivery of the grants - all  the  grants  that  we  have.  Now  people  are
saying, ``It is going to fail.''

Why do you already pre-empt what is going to happen?  Do  you  perhaps  have
certain people posted in the departments whom you are going to  support,  to
make sure that the system fails? Why do you pre-empt it?  Have  you  planted
some third force within the department that is going to ensure  that  things
fail? Do not do that, because you make us think a lot. [Interjections.]

Do not talk about that, because you moved out of the ANC. We do not want  to
talk about those things. Do not distract me. They  are  not  aware  that  as
they  talk  against  these  Bills,  they  are  in  fact  highlighting  their
significance and the significance of all the social services, the grants.

The hon Borman indicated that 9 million people  are  benefiting  from  these
grants. That is a good effort. I am  glad  that  you  mentioned  it.  Whilst
figures differ - some will say 9 million people whilst  others  will  say  8
million people, whatever the number -  the  fact  is,  as  the  hon  Masutha
indicated, it is a big improvement, and we are claiming  this  progress,  we
are claiming the success.

As the ANC, we know that the fact that we  are  passing  these  Bills  shows
that we have identified weaknesses and are trying to rectify  them.  We  are
not going to run away from the shortcomings. We know that, as human  beings,
we are going to have  shortcomings  and  we  are  addressing  them.  Do  not
distract us. Please do not do that.

Let us now look at the  issue  of  the  advertisements.  She  indicated  ...
[Interjections.] The hon Masutha has responded to that, I am  not  going  to
touch that issue. It is a sad story, as the hon Da Camara indicated,  to  be
against these Bills. But thank you, you have given  us  a  tool  to  go  and
slash you in front of the electorate. We are going to  say,  ``They  do  not
want an improvement''.

We are also going to remind you that you have been opposing each  and  every
Bill that is transforming anything that is not good. Every Bill, whether  it
is in health, education or social development, you  oppose.  Thank  you  for
giving us that, we are  going  to  tell  the  electorate  that.  Thank  you.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on.
Ms N M TSHEOLE: Thank you. My mike was off. No, I meant to say that  it  was
low. You have also ... [Laughter.] They make me laugh, hon members,  because
they are just like that. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: You make us laugh!

Ms N M TSHEOLE: They make me laugh, they want to distract me,  but  I  still
have time. [Interjections.] I am just pausing to give  you  a  chance.  When
people howl at you like they are doing, it is because you are  telling  them
the truth. [Applause.] Definitely. It is because I  am  telling  the  truth.
[Laughter.] I usually do  not  get  distracted,  but  this  hon  member  ...
[Interjections.]  Chairperson,  will  you  protect  me  from  these  people?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think  we  have  had  enough.
Let the hon member now complete her speech.

An HON MEMBER: The best thing you can do is to sit down.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members! Continue.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: The hon Southgate indicated that the system, as it is,  does
not warrant the transfer of the delivery of the  grants  from  provinces  to
the national Government. I do not know where she  comes  from.  Doesn't  she
realise or didn't she hear that even the court yesterday  ruled  that  these
grants have to be paid centrally?

They keep on talking about the  Taylor  Commission  Report,  but  when  that
report recommends the main thing, ie  comprehensive  social  security,  they
say no, why transfer? You find that you will never  know  what  they  really
want. Which part of the report have they  read?  What  have  you  read,  hon
member?

Hon Inka Mars refers to a number of  issues,  for  example  assets  and  the
other things she mentioned.  We  said  that  this  is  a  step  towards  the
comprehensive system. Those are other things that  are  going  to  be  dealt
with when the  whole  social  security  system  is  made  comprehensive  and
implemented.

I do  not  see  why  we  should  raise  certain  things  when  we  are  just
introducing the system. Are they saying that we must just wait? Like I  said
earlier on, people who have never lived in a shack  will  be  surprised  why
poor people live in shacks. We are used to such conditions, although  we  do
not enjoy them, but we are determined and nothing is going to stop  us  from
improving them through the adoption of these Bills.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Thank you, hon  members.  I  am  sorry  for  having  allowed
myself to be distracted. The ANC supports these Bills.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Chair, I  am  not  going  to  take  much
time. But I just want to say, from the beginning, that I think that some  of
the remarks that have been made,  specifically  by  the  DA,  are  below  my
dignity to answer and I will not stoop so low.

However, I would really advise the hon Tony Leon and  the  hon  Seremane  to
talk to their members to understand, basically, what  is  at  stake  and  to
also look at the history of this House and this Parliament, where all  these
policies come from. These policies do not come from the sky: they come  from
the discussions and debates that have taken place in this House and in  this
country over the past six, seven years. Quite obviously,  they  are  unaware
of that or they don't want to know that. [Interjections.]

They don't want to know the fact that these  policies  basically  come  from
the Chikane  Commission  and  the  recommendations  of  the  Public  Service
Commission on the issues of social  services  and  social  welfare  in  this
country. I think they need to be  ignored  by  any  normal  person  in  this
House. Their remarks are not worthwhile.

I was a little bit puzzled, actually saddened,  by  the  remarks  that  were
made by some of the members. However,  I  would  try  to  respond  with  all
humility to the remarks made by the hon member Mars, for instance, from  the
IFP. You are aware, first of all  hon  member,  that  the  issue  of  social
security and, basically, the issue of the Department of  Social  Development
and, to a large extent, its policies were very much a  compromise  with  the
IFP. That was very much so and you know that very well.

With your background in the field, you  would  definitely  know,  basically,
that this is a national function. You would definitely  know  that  it  was,
basically, after talks - I was still Minister for  the  Public  Service  and
Administration at that time - between the Minister at that time and  Cabinet
that the ANC agreed, reluctantly, to this  function  being  brought  to  the
level of provinces. You remember that very, very well. So,  naturally,  this
was never a provincial function. It was  a  national  function.  But  simply
because we wanted to work with the IFP, in particular, we agreed to that.

Unfortunately, a lot of problems occurred at the  time,  and  in  the  final
analysis we did see, even then, that there were problems which,  to  a  very
large extent, led to the problems that surrounded  the  former  Minister  Mr
Abe Williams, and you know that very well. You know that  on  the  basis  of
these problems we set up the  Chikane  Commission  and  the  Public  Service
Commission, which made all the necessary recommendations, and it  took  more
than two or three years of discussions within the welfare  sector  and  with
NGOs to try to resolve these issues and to come to the present decision.  So
it is not something new that we are talking about at the present moment.

However, at the same time, another point is  that  the  setting  up  of  the
agency will give the department and the Government more time to  concentrate
on welfare services,  which  at  the  present  moment  do  not  receive  the
necessary attention they deserve. I think that this is one thing  we  should
also look into, which is part and  parcel  of  the  decisions  that  we  are
talking about at the present moment.

I am a little bit saddened actually that some of the issues that  have  been
raised here are more ideological than factual, because sometimes  they  show
very little understanding of the issues and research that has  taken  place,
which is part and parcel of the broader consultation process  that  we  have
had with our community.

With that, I think I want to take this opportunity to  thank  the  portfolio
committee for the amount of work that they produced.

Ndithi ningadinwa  nangomso.  Kuse  kude  phambili.  Masisebenzisane  kunye.
Abantu bakuthi baziinkosi zethu. Nangamso. [I say thank you  very  much.  We
still have a long way to  go.  Let's  work  together.  Our  people  are  our
masters.] [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon  members.  There  seems  to  be  a

a few more minutes? [Interjections.]

Order! Order, hon members. The voting system is still  giving  us  problems,
so we will have to postpone the decision on the question. We  will  ask  the

the question of when this vote will be held again.

                           NATIONAL GAMBLING BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

THE MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chairperson. Let me just  say
that I deny completely that the failure in the voting  system  had  anything
to do with gambling.

Chairperson and members, the National Gambling Bill  that  has  been  tabled
today replaces the National Gambling Act of 1996.

CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, can you give  me  a  minute?
Order! Hon Members, Order! Order! Please continue, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chair. The National  Gambling
Bill replaces the National Gambling Act of 1996 which has served us for  the
past seven years. In this time, we have learned  much  and  this  experience
has caused us to revise the legislation. The new Bill seeks to  improve  our
ability to effectively regulate this  very  large  cash-based  industry,  to
enhance co-operative governance as outlined in the  Constitution,  and  also
seeks  to  introduce  new  measures  to  address  the  potentially  negative
socioeconomic consequences of  gambling  on  our  communities.  As  you  may
recall,  gambling  was  legalised  in  1996   as   an   activity   regulated
concurrently by national and provincial government.

Gambling is a matter on  which  there  are  strong  views  in  our  society.
However, the  Government's  view  has  been  a  pragmatic  one  in  that  it
acknowledges the human penchant for  gambling  and  believes  it  better  to
regulate the  industry  than  to  seek  to  outlaw  it,  whereby  inevitably
creating a whole new group of criminal acts. By regulating the industry,  we
can both curb excess and the  adverse  social  impact  and  achieve  certain
socioeconomic  policy  objectives.  Four  public  policy   objectives   were
identified which were to be met by the industry. These  objectives  included
the promotion of black economic empowerment,  the  creation  of  employment,
the creation of new fixed investment and infrastructure and  the  generation
of revenue.

The gambling industry today is an industry that generates  about  R7 billion
in turnover and is a significant  employer,  accounting  for  about  50  000
direct and indirect jobs.

THE CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon members, there is  far  too
much noise!

THE MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: The industry contributed ...

THE CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Will members please take their seats.  Order!
Please continue, hon Minister.

THE  MINISTER  OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  The  industry  contributes   about
R490 billion in gambling tax and has directly generated almost  R12  billion
in new fixed investments and  infrastructure.  In  addition,  advances  have
been made in  respect  to  black  economic  empowerment,  although  recently
concerns have been raised in this regard. We now better understand the  need
for  uniformity  of  regulation  and  how  to  seek  to   address   negative
socioeconomic  consequences  of  gambling  as  well  as   some   undesirable
marketing practices.

The National Gambling Act of 1996 was enacted at a time when the  principles
of the Constitution and the need for co-operative  governance  were  as  yet
untested. In 1996, our focus was on eradicating  a  large  illegal  gambling
industry  that  had  developed  under  the  apartheid  regime.  The  illegal
gambling industry has been brought under control to a significant extent  in
many regions. As we have tightened  our  control  over  cash  movements  and
potential money laundering or illicit financing operations, we now  have  to
ensure proper and effective oversight over an  industry  that  is  primarily
cash-based.

In tabling the  new  National  Gambling  Bill,  we  seek  to  address  these
challenges:  clarifying  the   roles   between   national   and   provincial
regulators; creating common norms and  standards  for  provincial  licensing
activities;   establishing   mechanisms   for    co-operative    governance;
implementing enhanced measures of oversight  and  control;  and  addressing,
pro-actively, some of the negative socioeconomic consequences of gambling.

The Bill introduces a number  of  measures  to  minimise  the  socioeconomic
costs of gambling. In particular, it provides  for  enhanced  protection  of
minors;  prohibiting  access  to  gambling  areas  and  access  to  gambling
activities by minors; restriction on  granting  of  credit  to  gamblers;  a
scheme of exclusion whereby addicted gamblers can exclude  themselves  or  a
court can order a person, upon request from  a  dependant,  to  be  excluded
from access to gambling activities; restriction on advertising or  promotion
of gambling activities in order to prevent persons being induced to  gamble;
and the setting of standards for gambling premises including,  for  example,
how the gambling floor should be separated from other  activities  and  what
notices must be posted.

These new measures are aimed primarily at prevention but also at  cure.  For
this reason, the  Bill  imposes  an  explicit  obligation  on  the  National
Gambling Board and  the  provincial  gambling  boards  to  monitor  negative
socioeconomic impact and to  conduct  broad-based  education  programmes  to
educate the public about the risks of gambling and  potential  risks.  Other
measures to limit potential socioeconomic costs  also  include  requirements
for licensing decisions, such as the impact of proposed gambling  activities
on the community.

Furthermore, in recognition of the potentially detrimental impact  that  the
introduction of LPMs may have on  society,  the  Bill  requires  the  phased
implementation of these  machines,  with  each  phase  being  punctuated  by
socioeconomic impact assessments.

The Bill further  requires  provincial  licensing  authorities  to  evaluate
commitments by industry to black economic empowerment and, when  considering
a licence or a licence renewal, it  enables  the  provincial  regulators  to
impose additional conditions when various commitments  have  not  been  met.
The Bill introduces measures to enhance control over the gambling  industry.
These measures include the establishment of a national register of  gambling
machines which will track every gambling machine throughout  the  course  of
its  useful  life.  It  is  expected  that  this   mechanism   will   assist
significantly  with  the  monitoring  and  control  over  illegal   gambling
machines and with the work of the SA Police Services. In addition,  the  re-
enactment of the requirement that all limited payout machines are linked  to
a national central electronic monitoring system will ensure that we will  be
able to detect any tampering  with  the  machines  and  their  payouts,  and
ensure accurate statement of revenues and allow for the detection of  money-
laundering activities.

Another key objective of the Bill is to clarify the roles  of  national  and
provincial  regulators  and  to  eliminate,   where   possible   and   where
constitutionally feasible, any duplication or overlap. In this  regard  this
Bill introduces a scheme of national  licences  for  manufacturers,  testing
agents of gambling equipment and employees of  the  gambling  industry.  The
board sets the criteria at the national level, but  the  Bill  provides  for
provincial licensing authorities to issue all licences, whether national  or
provincial. The role of the  National  Gambling  Board  is  to  monitor  and
oversee the industry, its socioeconomic  impact  and  the  effectiveness  of
provincial  regulators  to  advise  the  National  Gambling  Policy  Council
accordingly on matters of concern and policy.

Finally, the Bill seeks to harmonise provincial  activities  by  introducing
norms and standards for provincial licensing activities. In  Chapter  4,  we
are establishing the National Gambling Policy  Council,  consisting  of  the
Minister and the executive council members, to develop  national  norms  and
standards, to develop  national  policy  in  respect  of  gambling,  and  to
promote inter-governmental relations in respect of the gambling industry.

The National Gambling Bill 2003 thus  gives  expression  to  the  objectives
that I have  outlined  at  the  beginning  of  my  speech,  namely  enhanced
oversight and control over  the  gambling  industry,  improved  co-operative
governance,   and   the   minimisation   of   the   negative   socioeconomic
consequences.

Yet again, let me express my thanks to  the  portfolio  committee  who  have
helped us to steer the legislation  to  this  point  and  for  the  valuable
contributions  they  have  made  in  doing  so.  Thanks  to  my   provincial
colleagues and their officials for their assistance  and  input.  Thanks  to
the DTI and the National Gambling Board for their hard  work.  I  must  also
say a special word of thanks to many people in the industry and  in  various
social groups who went out of their way to ensure that we  address  economic
need and reality, whilst ensuring social responsibility. I commend the  Bill
to the House.

Dr R H DAVIES:  Chairperson,  the  Minister  has  just  outlined  the  basic
strategic approach to regulation that the Government has been  following  in
respect of gambling since 1994. My understanding of this  is  that  it  sets
out from a recognition that gambling is a potentially harmful activity,  not
just because there is potential for a relatively small number of players  of
gambling games to become addicted or compulsive gamblers, but  also  because
there is potential for  gambling  to  be  promoted  among  poor  people  and
communities in ways that result in significant transfers of  resources  from
lower income people to  the  only  consistent  winners  of  gambling  games,
namely the owners and operators of gambling activities.

However, this approach is  also  based  on  the  need  to  take  account  of
existing and historical  realities.  Under  apartheid,  legal  gambling  was
limited to betting on horses in most of the country with  casinos  permitted
only in the so-called rural homelands. These were,  however,  not  the  only
forms of gambling that emerged in  South  Africa  before  1994.  A  sizeable
illegal casino industry grew up in major towns and cities, frequented  by  a
significant number of punters. Under such  circumstances,  the  approach  to
regulation is premised on the view that outright prohibition would  be  both
unenforceable in that it would tend to drive the  industry  underground  and
undesirable in that it would  criminalise  activities  engaged  in  by  many
ordinary people.

Instead, the approach  to  regulation  seeks  to  create  a  controlled  and
limited legal gambling industry based on certain basic norms  and  standards
while acting vigorously against illegal gambling. Accepting,  as  I  believe
most of us do, that this broad paradigm does not resolve all debates.  There
remain a number of very real policy  choices  and  decisions  including  how
much of what kind of activity should be  permitted  and  what  controls  and
regulations should be placed on the different forms.

All of this  has  to  take  into  account  the  relevant  schedules  of  the
Constitution which provide that casinos, racing, gambling  and  wagering  is
an area of concurrent national and provincial legislative competence.

The Bill before the House today provides a coherent framework  for  national
and provincial government to work  together  in  a  spirit  of  co-operative
governance in the regulation of this industry. In particular,  it  clarifies
a number of issues of jurisdiction  that  were  unclear  in  the  1996  Act,
essentially by allowing national legislation and structures set up in  terms
of this Bill to determine  the  basic  norms  and  standards  for  both  the
conduct and the roll-out of gambling activity.

One of the most intense debates that took place in the  portfolio  committee
was over the approach to limited pay-out machines. These are more  popularly
known as one-armed bandits for the simple reason that when one sticks  one's
money in them, one is robbed. Some  have  asked  why  we  in  the  portfolio
committee focused so much on this particular form of  gambling.  The  answer
of course is that legal limited pay-out machines have not  yet  been  rolled
out on an extensive scale. Only some of the provinces  have  authorised  the
roll-out of a relatively small number. Several provinces are  in  the  midst
of sharp debates about whether or not to do so,  and  many  communities  and
civil society groups have expressed themselves against this.

Members of the committee were also well aware of  the  results  of  research
commissioned by the National Gambling Board which would indicate that  South
Africa is ranked 14th among 50 leading gambling countries of  the  world  in
terms of gross gambling turnover. This is a very high ranking,  particularly
compared to the ranking of this country at 29th in terms of  gross  domestic
product and 91st in terms of per capita income.

The clear majority of us in the committee were convinced  that,  under  such
circumstances, any mass roll-outs  of  limited  pay-out  machines  would  be
extremely problematic, more particularly so if these were targeted at  areas
and facilities frequented by low-income people. We were told in  the  public
hearings that operators had calculated that each  machine  could  deliver  a
gross revenue, after paying winnings, of between twelve hundred and  fifteen
hundred rands a week. If the existing maximum proposed roll-out  of  50  000
machines countrywide, itself a reduction  from  some  of  the  ambitions  of
certain interests, were to be proceeded with, this would  mean  a  diversion
of resources of between R3,1  and  R3,8  billion  from  consumption  to  the
operators of limited payout machines.

In the course of our deliberations, the Limited Payout Machines  Association
and Fabcos both implicitly acknowledged the concern in this  regard.  During
our proceedings, they wrote to us offering to accept a lower maximum  of  30
000. This is a move  in  the  right  direction  but,  in  the  view  of  the
portfolio committee, this  is  not  enough.  After  a  long  and  passionate
debate, we eventually opted for continuing with the approach  of  regulation
and  control,  rather  than  embarking  on   an   alternative,   potentially
litigation-prone course of outright prohibition.

The Bill  provides  for  the  Minister  to  strictly  regulate  a  phased-in
introduction of limited payout machines and  also  regulate  their  location
and the conduct of their operations. Any decision to move from one phase  to
the next must be based on  an  ongoing  assessment  of  their  socioeconomic
impact.

It is the strong view of the majority in the portfolio  committee  that  the
first phase should involve only a small number of limited  payout  machines.
During the hearings, the  LPMA  told  us  that  they  had  no  intention  of
targeting the roll-out at  poor  people  and  that  their  preferred  target
market was more affluent people for whom  playing  limited  payout  machines
would be a minor form of entertainment.

It is my earnest hope that any limited payout machines that do find a  place
in our leisure industry occupy precisely such a niche. Anyone who  envisages
a future for one-armed bandits in our  society  had  better  take  steps  to
ensure that we do not again see scenes on our television such  as  those  we
saw a few weeks ago of pensioners putting their money into LPMs in the  vain
hope of solving their financial problems. Public opinion  simply  would  not
stand for this.

While the  LPM  issue  commanded  a  good  deal  of  our  attention  in  the
committee, there were also a number of other amendments  introduced  by  us.
The Bill before the House provides for, among other things,  regulations  to
be  issued,  restricting  the  granting  of  credit  to  gamblers,   for   a
prohibition on false and misleading  advertising  as  well  as,  subject  to
regulation, on the provision of free discounted services  as  an  inducement
to gamble.

During the course of our proceedings, the committee received  correspondence
from  the  Casino  Association  acknowledging  the  legitimacy  of  concerns
expressed by members about the practice of  bussing  pensioners  to  casinos
and also  acknowledging  that  separate  entrances  should  be  provided  at
existing operations for access to  family  entertainment  activities.  These
are matters which the Bill provides to be dealt with by way  of  regulation,
but I would urge the Casino Association not  to  wait  for  the  regulations
before implementing reforms  that  they  themselves  have  acknowledged  are
warranted.

A provision I would finally briefly like to  mention  is  section  53.  This
places an obligation  on  provincial  licensing  authorities,  who  will  be
responsible  for  issuing  gambling  licenses,  to  consider  the  potential
socioeconomic impact on communities of any proposed license. Licensees  will
also be required to demonstrate their commitment to combating addictive  and
compulsive gambling and to promoting black economic empowerment.

The Bill before us offers an improved legal  and  regulatory  framework  for
regulation of the gambling industry. The gambling industry in  this  country
must, in my view, find its place as a relatively minor part of  the  broader
leisure and entertainment complex. We must  not  be  seduced  into  thinking
that gambling is some magical fast track to enrichment. It is certainly  not
that for punters. One of the provisions  of  this  Bill  is  for  regulatory
authorities to  provide  public  education,  which  hopefully  will  include
promoting a better understanding of odds which will enable  people  to  know
that the only consistent winner is the operator  of  gambling  machines  and
not the punters who, as a  whole,  have  to  be  consistent  losers  if  the
industry is to be profitable.

Gambling is equally neither a golden fast  track  to  enrichment  either  by
currently   or   still-to-be   empowered   entrepreneurs.   Black   economic
empowerment must be promoted in this industry as in all other  and,  as  the
Broad-Based Black  Economic  Empowerment  Bill  passed  by  this  Parliament
provides, regulated industries, of which this is one, must be of  particular
focus in efforts to promote black economic empowerment.

We must be wary of  claims  that  by  loosening  regulatory  reigns  on  the
gambling industry we can create a fast track to black economic  empowerment.
This is a self-serving and also a false and misleading claim.  The  research
I have already referred to indicates that South Africa already  has  a  high
incidence of gambling. There are serious doubts about the sustainability  of
some of the existing operations. There is certainly  not  some  new  bonanza
around the corner and definitely not one that can be  found  by  preying  on
the poor and vulnerable.

The  gambling  industry  must  be  socially  responsible  if  it  is  to  be
sustainable. This Bill will provide an  improved  regulatory  framework  for
the gambling  industry  in  South  Africa.  I  therefore  have  pleasure  in
commending it to the House. [Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairman, the view over Durban from  high  up  in  Berea  is
spectacular: a sweeping panorama stretching from Umhlanga  in  the  distance
north to the airport and the refineries in the south. Before  you  lies  the
Greyville Racecourse, the city centre, harbour and the beach front, all  set
against the green  vegetation  of  the  majestic  Bluff  with  its  recently
completed futuristic tower. By day the view can literally take  your  breath
away.

At night it changes dramatically with neon and  spotlights  vying  to  outdo
each other; with streams of light and vivid colours against the  black  sky.
And no lights are brighter, more  spectacular,  more  garish  perhaps,  than
those that pulse from a new addition to the new  Durban  skyline:  a  pseudo
art deco palace of promise; a place where fortunes can be  made  and  dreams
realised by the throw of a dice, the turn of a wheel, the pull of a lever.

The Sun Coast Casino and entertainment world is, by its own  admission,  the
hottest spot in town, with 30 other similar casino  complexes  across  South
Africa. It is a beacon to hopeful fun-seekers who flock to its  doors,  just
as it is a magnet to the hopeless who come in for a desperate last  shot  at
redemption. It is a place of bright lights and dark shadows.

Legislating the gambling industry has always been fraught with  controversy.
Is it a social evil that we cannot afford  or  just  a  relatively  harmless
form  of  entertainment?  How  do  we  measure  opportunities  for  economic
empowerment, the jobs created and the tax revenues against the hardship  and
misery it can also bring about? It  is  neither  possible  nor  feasible  to
prohibit and criminalise gambling. To do so only begs an illegal response.

If anything, apartheid taught us all that the  more  you  legislate  against
things, and the more you restrict freedom of choice, the more what  you  are
trying to suppress  will  go  underground  and  manifest  itself  elsewhere.
Gambling should be  clearly  and  specifically  regulated  to  minimise  its
potentially harmful effect on  society.  Where  sensibly  and  pragmatically
regulated, it provides new jobs, legitimate incomes and substantial  revenue
streams for the fiscus, all of which allow Government to improve  the  lives
of those communities who need it most.

This Bill strikes  that  balance.  It  targets  many  of  the  socioeconomic
consequences of gambling by restricting casinos in the granting  of  credit,
access to cash and advertising endorsements. It creates a  scheme  of  self-
exclusion and court-ordered self-exclusion for prohibited gamblers and  sets
black economic empowerment and socioeconomic criteria in most areas  of  the
industry. It  does  so  sensibly,  for  instance  by  amending  section  13,
recognising the potential impact that  credit  extension  for  gambling  may
have on the poor, but correctly directing this to  a  consumer  credit  law;
and retaining section 15, which restricts the advertising of  free  services
and free gambling.

A key issue is  in  section  26,  namely  the  roll-out  of  limited  payout
machines. Despite vehement arguments from some of his  ANC  colleagues,  the
Minister has bravely and correctly  stuck  to  his  regulative  rather  than
prohibitive approach. Reducing the maximum number of machines, phasing  them
in over a trial period with a full socioeconomic assessment at  the  end  of
each phase, with local community involvement, and strictly  proscribing  the
locations of  all  site  operators  is  both  in  the  public  interest  and
sensible.

What is not are the calls for the wholesale ban on LPMs and the claims  that
they will only create more gambling debt and greater misery. No  matter  how
deeply these members care about  their  constituents  -  and  they  do  care
deeply - that stance is hypocritical and unfair to a  small  sector  of  the
industry. With 31 casinos booming,  a  thriving  horse-racing  industry  and
lotto queues stretched on every street corner twice a  week,  that  argument
is way too late. The horse has long since left the stable.

Again it is to the Minister's credit that he has  rejected  these  pressures
in favour of a more pragmatic approach. A strong  case  has  been  made  for
multiple provincial monitoring systems linked to a national network,  rather
than a single centralised system as provided for in section 27 of the  Bill,
not least of all because of valid criticism of the current operator,  Zankey
monitoring systems. There is merit in provinces running their  own  systems,
but while the Bill does  insist  on  a  national  system,  nothing  prevents
provinces running their own concurrent systems if they wish so.
In conclusion, fighting a corner for the gambling  industry  is  never  easy
and in a country like South Africa it is  sometimes  impossible.  The  moral
high ground lies elsewhere, but outlawing it is  foolish  and  being  overly
prescriptive will simply drive it underground.  This  Bill  is  a  pragmatic
attempt to limit the  potentially  negative  socioeconomic  consequences  of
gambling, while allowing the broad mass of South Africans, those of  us  who
are not disposed towards gambling ourselves into  debt  or  taking  on  more
credit that we can handle, to go out and have some legitimate fun, if we  so
wish. It still  allows  for  practical,  concurrent  jurisdiction  with  the
provinces and, most of all, it  keeps  the  bright  lights  shining;  bright
enough to keep  the  dark  shadows  at  bay.  The  DA  supports  this  Bill.
[Applause.]

Dr  U  ROOPNARAIN:  Chairperson,  members  of  this  House,  gambling  is  a
widespread human pursuit. Many fortunes of families and principalities  have
depended on the turn of a card and the roll of a dice.  This  gambling  Bill
replaces the Gambling Act.  The  IFP  opposes  the  National  Gambling  Bill
because it is a blatant subversion of the  balance  between  provincial  and
national powers, as expressed in the Constitution.

In terms of the Constitution, gambling, with the exception of  the  national
lottery and sports  pool,  is  a  provincial  competence.  Attempts  by  the
Government to yield  total  uniformity  is  contrary  to  the  Constitution.
Clauses 21, 26 and 30 clearly  annotates  the  function  of  the  provinces.
Also, clause 17 bans ATMs from premises where  gambling  takes  place.  This
means that there would be  no  ATMs  throughout  a  resort  like  Sun  City.
Rather, the IFP would agree that ATMs should not be on the  casino  gambling
floor.

The Bill ignores the fact that in terms of the  Constitution  provinces  and
the  national  Government  have  exactly  the  same  measures  or  scope  of
legislative powers on these matters. Moreover, the national  Government  can
only  legislate  where  provinces  have  not  legislated  or   where   their
legislation falls under one of the overrides, as set out in section  146  of
the Constitution.
This Bill ignores the existence of provincial legislation in the  field  and
purports to override such legislation, even beyond what it is allowed to  do
in  terms  of  section  146.  For  example,  KwaZulu-Natal  has  provided  a
framework for a credible, profitable and legal gambling industry. This  Bill
pretends  to  be  a  national  override  in  its  entirety  and  effectively
dispossesses the provinces of their powers. One cannot negate the work  done
by the provinces. The proof of this statement is in the fact that  the  Bill
itself purports to provide what provinces can or cannot  do  and  what  they
can and cannot legislate in gambling matters, which makes the  entire  grant
of legislative powers made and expressed  in  the  Constitution  superfluous
and semantic. The structure of this Bill would be  appropriate  if  national
legislation were to grant legislative powers to provinces in  matters  which
they have none.

This Bill makes a mockery of the Constitution, especially in  matters  where
the provinces have a plenary legislative power. Also the Bill,  once  it  is
enacted, will have serious impact on the rights of existing licences,  where
these rights constitute property. While the attempt in this Bill is to  deal
with the moral corrosiveness of gambling, gambling is  undeniably  important
to the provinces, especially for revenue, growth, job creation  and  tourism
promotion.  Yet,  with  such  outlandish  clauses,  this  Bill  will  remain
unimplementable. The IFP does not believe  in  the  usurping  of  provincial
powers, hence we cannot support this Bill. I thank you.

Dr R  T  RHODA:  Chairman,  notions  of  good  and  evil  have  never  shown
themselves to be unalterable.


  They change with place, they shift with race ... Each  Vice  has  worn  a
  Virtue's crown; all Good was banned as Sin or Crime.

Gambling has existed in every known society, from the most primitive to  the
most complex. Psychologists believe that the  real  attraction  of  gambling
lies in the thrills and the tensions of uncertainty, the daring involved  in
taking chances, the chance of testing one's skill or luck, the  satisfaction
of beating an opponent and the  dreams  of  sudden  good  fortune.  Gambling
remains popular even though most societies have disapproved of it  and  have
made laws to forbid or restrict it.

Gambling and legislation to regulate it will  always  be  controversial.  To
some,  a  social  evil;  to  others,  a  harmless  form  of   entertainment.
Proponents and opponents of legalised gambling each  have  their  points  of
view. It is simply not possible or feasible to prohibit or  criminalise  it,
but like liquor, it is potentially dangerous  and  can  destroy  the  social
fabric of a country if not properly controlled.

Under the old South  African  government  gambling  was  prohibited  on  the
grounds that it was immoral and that government had the right to impose  the
moral values of its supporters and all  others.  However,  this  prohibition
was  eroded  in  part  by  the  development  of  casinos  in  the  so-called
homelands. But far more drastically, it was eroded by the  proliferation  of
illegal casinos all over South Africa. The illegal casinos were  unlicensed,
uncontrolled and easily accessible as they sprung up wherever  there  was  a
market, especially for machine gambling.

The New NP's main concern  and  the  responsibility  of  the  Government  is
focused around the introduction  of  safeguarding  measures  to  combat  the
incidence of problem gambling and to use everything in our  power  to  limit
the potentially negative socioeconomic effects of  this  industry.  To  this
end several measures, limitations and restrictions  have  been  included  in
the Bill.

I would like to  conclude  by  complimenting  the  Minister,  the  director-
general, his deputy, the  members  of  the  portfolio  committee  and  other
stakeholders for the final product.

The New NP supports the Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairman, hon Minister, the horse certainly has bolted and  now
we want to close the  stable  door.  As  Mr  Skweyiya's  budget  for  social
development tragically evaporates in the aftermath of gambling policies  and
legislation in South Africa, we have the ANC, the DA, the New NP and  others
in this House to thank.

Their irresponsible behaviour in voting for the National  Gambling  Bill  in
1996 can be likened to knowingly lighting a devastating fire and fanning  it
with consequent legislation. Now we see these same people trying  to  manage
the fire and shamelessly looking for credit for doing so.

The ACDP does not support legislation that condones  and  promotes  gambling
and strongly objected to the  National  Gambling  Act  in  1996,  which  was
supported by the ANC, the DA and the New NP.

Exploitation of the poor is unacceptable under any name and the lottery  and
casinos are no exception. Gambling is unprofitable for all  but  a  few  and
cannot be defended in terms of benefiting the economy.  The  revenue-raising
ability for provinces and black economic empowerment were  used  as  carrots
to con the public, but the reality is: Poverty has increased;  organisations
working  to  alleviate  suffering  receive  little  or  no  assistance;  the
promised tax take is relatively poor; social  costs  are  astronomical;  and
regulatory costs are  exorbitant.  For  example,  the  direct  cost  of  the
administration of the industry is over R200 million per annum.

Limited payout machines are  another  disgrace,  being  conveniently  placed
where alcohol is consumed, ensuring a target  market  with  alcohol-induced,
reduced responsibility. The gambling industry exploits  people's  weaknesses
and undermines efforts toward moral regeneration. This new culture  promotes
greed and instant gratification and undermines the  need  to  study,  family
life, delayed consumption and frugality. Gambling is a direct attack on  the
family and fosters prostitution, money-laundering,  gangsterism,  drugs  and
liquor - all industries which impact negatively on the  spread  of  HIV/Aids
and on law and order.

The  detrimental  social  and  economic  effects  of  gambling   were   well
documented and pointed out by the ACDP in 1996 and on many other  occasions.
Surely this sort of irresponsible behaviour should  not  be  condoned.  Will
the ANC, DA and New NP pay for their folly or will this too be only  at  the
expense of the poor and the taxpaying South Africans?

The repealing of the 1996 Gambling Act is long overdue. This Bill  does  not
go  far  enough  and  will  not  remove  the  blight  of  gambling  and  its
devastating effects on our nation. One cannot help but wonder what  gambling
industry insiders will be paying into political party election coffers.  The
ACDP is voting against this smokescreen referred to as a Bill. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson.

An HON MEMBER: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of the women!]

Compulsive and addictive gambling has become a major  social  issue  in  our
society. The MF strongly supports the provision introduced in this  Bill  to
nationally  and  provincially  regulate  casinos,   racing,   gambling   and
wagering.

The MF  is  especially  supportive  of  the  introduction  of  prohibitions,
requirements and standards to reduce  the  harmful  social  consequences  of
compulsive and  addictive  gambling.  We  have  seen  many  who  gamble  for
entertainment, desperation and luck being drawn into the  web  of  gambling.
No objection to the act of gambling is expressed, as the MF knows that  this
has  the  benefit  of  drawing  in  foreign  capital.  However,  concern  is
expressed.

Further support is given to the control of payout gambling machines that  is
provided for. It is felt that the interim  relationship  between  provincial
regulatory agencies and the National Gambling  Board  would  greatly  assist
regulations and effective management.

The MF supports the provisions  in  this  Bill  and  the  National  Gambling
Board. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you, Chairperson.  Hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members,
compulsive gambling and the devastating effects of such an addiction on  the
poorer sector of society have necessitated this new Bill.

Sensible opinion will contend that, had we not legalised gambling, we  would
not belatedly have to remedy the mess  we're  in  now.  Since  gambling  was
legalised, South Africa has become  one  of  the  world's  leading  gambling
nations, as referred to earlier - not something to be proud of.  A  national
gambling survey has found that of all South  Africans  gambling  in  casinos
22% are unemployed, and that of all Lotto players 27% are unemployed  -  all
people with no disposable income to waste.

A gambling authority from Salford University in the UK and secretary to  the
Executive Directorate of the SA National Gambling  Programme  has  cautioned
that the Government's proposed  measures  ``may  not  be  the  best  way  to
address the problem of excessive gambling''. Taking  into  account  all  the
problems, any alleviating measures are a step in the right direction.

Nevertheless the AIM opposes the Bill on principle. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs B M NTULI: Chairperson, as we celebrate the  first  decade  of  freedom,
the struggle to eradicate poverty and underdevelopment  remains  fundamental
to achieving a better life for all.

We have introduced a number of  new  pieces  of  legislation,  policies  and
other methods that have systematically broken down the legacy of  apartheid.
We have engaged in a vigorous process of  transformation  that  has  created
opportunities for our people to participate meaningfully in the  economy  of
this  country.  We  have  moved  away  from  policy  formulation  to  policy
implementation. Considerable progress has  been  made  in  transforming  the
state machinery by putting more accountable  mechanisms  in  place  to  help
remove all forms of inequality, racism and sexism and to address  the  other
social and economic effects of apartheid.

During the past 10 years, we as Government have played a pioneering role  in
striving towards sustainable development and  overall  poverty  alleviation.
We have left no stone unturned in helping to contribute to  economic  growth
that can fight poverty and unemployment  and  create  job  opportunities  in
order  to  improve  the  lives  of  our  people.  We  have  encouraged   the
development of small, medium and  microenterprises,  especially  black-owned
companies, to give effect to the clause in the  Freedom  Charter  that  says
that the people shall share in the country's wealth.

However, gambling is not one of them. The social cost of  this  industry  is
too much to bear. People's lives can be destroyed, and I doubt  whether  our
country can afford this. It is for this reason that the objectives  of  this
Bill are to clarify and facilitate the exercise of  concurrent  jurisdiction
and  to  limit  the  potentially  negative  socioeconomic  consequences   of
gambling.

As a member of this Parliament, I am concerned about the impact of  gambling
on the social welfare of our families.  A  domestic  worker,  for  instance,
earning R600 per month could gamble  away  most  of  that  money  while  the
children or elderly in her care suffer.

Our socioecononomic impact assessment study on gambling found,  for  example
in the Northern Cape, that  problems  experienced  included  pensioners  who
gamble with what little  money  they  have,  illegal  casinos  and  numerous
complaints from welfare organisations.

The socioeconomic  consequences  are  worsened  by  the  fact  that  illegal
gambling has become very sophisticated. Gamblers no  longer  use  cash,  but
instead are using cards on which cash is  loaded,  making  illegal  gambling
difficult to prove.

With our country's high unemployment rate of 29%, many people  believe  that
gambling is their salvation. The average  gambler  in  South  Africa  is  30
years to 50 years old, earns less  than  R2 500  per  month  and  spends  on
average 10% of his or her income  to  win  just  R50.  One  in  every  seven
borrows money to gamble,  whilst  one  in  every  four  gambles  with  money
normally used for household purposes.

The  impact  on  the  poor  and  marginalised  communities  is  devastating.
Desperate gamblers believe that they can change their  lives  through  luck,
rather than trying to find a solution to their problems.  This  tendency  is
not confined to poor people alone.  Even  people  with  higher  incomes  and
substantial  disposable  incomes  are  seriously  being  challenged  by  the
negative consequences of their bad financial management.

Our churches believe that gambling is  morally  and  ethically  problematic,
and they are concerned about the burgeoning gambling  industry.  It  is  our
duty to constantly investigate and ensure that proper  means  are  found  to
restrict, monitor and control gambling, especially limited payout  machines,
in order to ensure that  the  poor  do  not  become  the  target  market  of
unscrupulous behaviour.

As one of my colleagues said, it is clear  that  the  aim  of  LPMs  is  not
recreational but to suck the last drop of  blood  out  of  our  communities,
especially out of the breadwinners. It is a pity we could not  convince  our
hon Minister to withdraw the provision for LPMs. We,  however,  respect  his
view that prohibition is not the best path and  that  a  renewed  effort  is
under way to  provide  for  more  effective  legislation  to  regulate  this
industry. We therefore welcome  the  assurance  by  the  department  not  to
increase the number of casinos above  the  current  maximum  of  40  or  the
number of LPMs above an envisaged maximum of 50 000.

I understand that there are specific difficulties relating  to  gambling  on
the Internet, but I am confident that the new  provision  in  the  Bill  can
assist in confiscating the material gains of  illegal  gambling  operations.
In addition, it can also assist us  with  new  envisaged  Internet  gambling
legislation that will be developed in the near future.

There is no doubt in my mind that we, as Government, have  made  a  positive
impact on the lives of our people over the past decade. The  broader  social
and environmental conditions and participation have changed for the  better.
However, we must look seriously at the impact of gambling on the poorest  of
the poor. We should rather aim to promote the spirit of Batho Pele and  help
to mend and reinforce  the  social  fabric  of  our  society  by  constantly
improving service delivery.

A recent study, the Economic Impact of Legalised Gambling in  South  Africa,
revealed that our country is currently portrayed as having  a  very  vibrant
gambling sector, which makes it one of the leading gambling nations  in  the
world. South Africa is rated 14th in  gross  gambling  turnover,  23rd  with
regard to gross gambling yields, and 8th in terms of gross casino yields.

The study also shows  that  the  highest  growth  is  taking  place  in  the
provinces that were previously excluded from such activities. This has  been
achieved in the short space of not more than five years. The high  level  of
acceptability of  gambling  among  the  South  African  population  and  the
relatively high propensity for gambling is three times as much  as  that  of
the USA and twice as much as that of New Zealand.

On the positive side, the study shows that  this  sector's  contribution  to
the GDP was more than R3 billion in 2000, and its contribution in  terms  of
employment is an additional  215 jobs  for  every  100  jobs  created.  This
sector  can,  if  properly  regulated,  contribute  towards  realising   the
national development objectives.

In order to find a solution to the regulations of  the  gamblig  sector,  we
consulted with different role-players in the industry and engaged in  public
hearings during July this year.  I  must  add  that  the  biggest  bunch  of
interested people ever  attended  the  public  hearings  in  the  Trade  and
Industry portfolio committee, bigger than I have seen in my term  of  office
here in Parliament.

The Bill tabled before us today addresses three  main  issues.  It  provides
for measures to combat addictive and  problem  gambling,  for  the  need  to
limit gambling opportunities and LPMs in particular, and for the  management
of the horse-racing industry.

Regarding the first  issue,  we  welcome  the  helpline  for  addictive  and
problem gamblers through  professional  institutions,  counselling  sessions
for people addicted to gambling and  for  problem  gamblers.  We  hope  that
these counsellors will be able to assist Government and help  diminish  both
the social and economic impact of gambling on our  people  in  a  quick  and
comprehensive manner, as the existence of a large illegal industry  and  the
broader social and economic impact of the industry are, as yet,  unclear  in
South Africa.

In the absence of a national central monitoring mechanism that could  create
synergy in regulating the roll-out of slot machines  in  the  provinces,  we
welcome the commitment given by  our  hon  Minister  and  members  from  our
provincial legislatures to promoting mechanisms that would  give  effect  to
co-operative governance.

We acknowledge that  horse-racing  is  an  industry  that  is  dependent  on
gambling for its continued existence. It is not an  ordinary  sport,  but  a
form of sport that used to be the only legal form of gambling. Therefore  it
had to be provided for separately,  since  policy  formulation  remains  the
domain of Government.

As the portfolio committee, we need to deal with  strong  moral  issues.  We
have dealt with the loan sharks, liquor and now  gambling.  This  sector  is
traumatic and some members have had personal experiences in this regard.

In my view there is a definite need  for  social  responsibility  programmes
that go beyond the narrow focus on compulsive gamblers. We propose that  the
National Gambling Policy Council be  mandated  to  monitor  the  effects  of
gambling on different socioeconomic groups.  We  also  want  to  assess  the
impact of social responsibility in  the  industry  and  encourage  community
consultation.

There is much evidence of distress in communities, and our main  concern  is
to fight for the public's interests. We fear the  danger  of  encouraging  a
culture of gambling overstimulation. As parliamentarians, we  must  regulate
undesirable conduct through regulations  that  alter  social  behaviour.  We
must not be swayed by  powerful  economic  interests,  or  by  opportunistic
businessmen making special pleadings. We  need  education  that  supplements
good law. By that, we mean that we either put strong  curbs  on  casinos  or
totally ban LPMs. Since this is not  possible,  we  need  to  regulate  this
industry through the implementation of an effective monitoring mechanism.

I want to conclude by saying that our Government should continue  to  ensure
that gambling does not adversely affect the lives of the citizens  of  South
Africa. We, as parliamentarians, should remain steadfast  in  our  quest  to
create a better life  for  all.  We  must,  through  the  implementation  of
effective legislation, ensure  that  the  gambling  industry  does  not,  in
striving for profit, bring with it suffering and false hope for our people.

The ANC supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER  OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Thank  you,  Chairperson.  As  I've
indicated, there are strong views on gambling. But I think that  what  we've
found is that there's a broad middle ground which chooses to deal with  this
matter in a pragmatic manner, and I'm pleased that the major  parties,  with
some exceptions that I'll come to, have adopted this approach. I  think  the
only feasible and viable  approach  is  that  of  trying  to  regulate  this
industry and strike the necessary balance between the  contending  views  on
it.

If I could briefly touch on some  of  the  views  raised  by  those  parties
dissenting and also those supporting. I've been, for  some  time,  perplexed
at the IFP's position on this matter. There's been no attempt whatsoever  to
override provincial powers, and no matter how much polemic you want  to  put
across, this is clearly not the intention of the Bill. What puzzles  me  is,
while we are moving to make sure quite  clearly  that  we  have  a  national
ability to regulate, without taking away any power from the  provinces,  why
should that be opposed?

If you look closely at the Bill, the areas that we're  choosing  to  tighten
up on are precisely where  no  single  province  can  keep  control  of  the
industry. So, in terms of co-operative governance, the  nine  provinces  are
working with the national Ministry to  ensure  that,  overall,  we  regulate
this industry. I can't for the life of me see why this  should  be  opposed.
Certain factual errors were also made about LPMs, etc, etc.

I would appeal to the IFP that there's no sense in doing  this.  We've  gone
out of our way - and this is why  it's  taken  us  so  long  and  why  we're
running to the wire even now - to make sure that the provinces are  involved
and have had a chance to look at this, and we are not by any stretch of  the
imagination taking away powers from the provinces. But I can't believe  that
the IFP would be supportive of the idea that the gambling  industry  is  not
regulated, that  we  don't  have  common  norms  and  standards  across  all
provinces. I really am quite surprised at this and very disappointed that  a
major party can take a position of this type.

I've always known that for the ACDP and the hon Dudley this was  an  act  of
faith. Now as Government we can't operate  just  on  acts  of  faith.  We've
consistently said that if you don't regulate this industry and you  try  and
suppress it, you are  creating  criminality  where  it's  not  necessary  to
create criminality. One must then do what we've  done,  which  is  to  bring
this into the ambit of reasonable people, protect people against  abuse  and
protect those who can't protect  themselves.  This  is  the  approach  we've
taken and we must continue with this approach.

It's also been contended by  the  hon  Millin  that  we've  suddenly  had  a
massive explosion of gambling. Well,  the  truth  is,  we  don't  know  what
happened before. At least under the regulated formulation that we have  now,
we've got a better idea of what's happening,  and  we've  got  a  much  more
public and a much more open and a much  more  transparent  attempt  to  deal
with problem gambling. But where you had illegal gambling, you  couldn't  do
that, and you can't do it. Therefore, it's not clear to  me  what  principle
we're upholding when we vote against something such as this.

Let me just say to the industry - and it's a point  I've  made  to  them  on
many occasions - their future depends on their conduct.  The  industry  will
have to conduct itself in an extremely responsible manner,  because  anybody
who's sat through these hearings will realise  -  many  speakers  have  made
this point, inter alia, the hon Lowe - that  there  are  many,  many  people
across all parties who don't believe gambling should be allowed.  Therefore,
if we're going to  follow  a  pragmatic  approach,  which  is  in  the  best
interests of the people who are affected by this, the industry will have  to
conduct itself at the highest standard of ethics.
And again, this can only be done if we set  exactly  the  same  standard  of
ethics  in  every  province  of  this  country.  We  can't   possibly   have
differential standards of ethics or differential control, and  that  doesn't
take away provincial power; it  just  enhances  South  Africa's  ability  to
regulate this industry. Thank you very  much  for  those  who  supported.  I
believe they were wise. [Applause.]

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter dated 30 September 2003 from the  Minister  of  Finance  to  the
     Speaker, tabled in terms of section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public  Finance
     Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the  delay  in  the
     tabling of the Annual Report and  Financial  Statements  of  the  South
     African Revenue Services for 2002-2003:


         Dear Madam Speaker


         TABLING OF SARS' ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


         In terms of section 65(1) of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
         1999, I as the  Executive  Authority  responsible  for  SARS,  must
         table SARS' annual report and financial statements in the  National
         Assembly within six months after the end  of  the  SARS'  financial
         year, which ended on 31 March 2003. The last date  for  tabling  in
         the National Assembly was, therefore, 30 September 2003.


         The management of SARS and the office of  the  Auditor-General  are
         still involved in intensive discussion on various complex  matters.
         It was not possible to conclude these discussions and  interactions
         within the required time limit.


         In view of the above discussions it was not possible  for  SARS  to
         finalise its annual report and  accompanying  financial  statements
         timeously to enable me to table the relevant documents  within  the
         required six month period in the National Assembly.
         The purpose of this letter is, therefore,  to  inform  you  that  I
         will not be able to table the annual report and  statements  within
         the required six month period and to table  a  written  explanation
         in terms of section 65(2) of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
         1999, setting out the reasons for  the  delay.  In  this  regard  I
         submit the aforementioned written explanation.


         I  will  happily  discuss  some  of   these   concerns   with   you
         telephonically.


         I leave this matter in your capable hands.


         Yours sincerely

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:
     Letter dated 23 September  2003,  from  the  Minister  of  Justice  and
     Constitutional Development tabled in terms of section 65(2)(a)  of  the
     Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining  the
     delay in the tabling of the Annual Report and Financial  Statements  of
     the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development for 2002-2003:


         Dear Madam Speaker,


         DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT: LATE  TABLING
         OF ANNUAL REPORT 2002/03


         The  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development   is
         required in terms of section 65 of the  Public  Finance  Management
         Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), to table  in  the  National  Assembly
         its annual report and financial statements and the audit report  on
         those statements within six months after the  financial  year  end.
         The Department is not in a position to table its annual  report  in
         Parliament before the end of this week, but will be in  a  position
         to do so during October 2003. The following has brought about  this
         unfortunate state of affairs:


         1. It must be accepted that the preparation  of  an  annual  report
              for a department of the size  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
              Development is a complex and time-consuming  process.  Various
              entities and institutions such as the Legal Aid Board and  the
              South  African  Human  Rights  Commission  form  part  of  the
              Department's   portfolio.   Most   of   these   entities   and
              institutions prepare and table their own annual reports.  Even
              the National Prosecuting Authority  (NPA),  one  of  the  core
              programmes of the Department, reports separately.  This  makes
              the co-ordination and compilation  of  a  consolidated  annual
              report difficult.


         2. The Department experienced difficulty in  adapting  to  the  new
              format for annual  reporting.  As  you  know,  the  Department
              received a very negative report on our last annual  report  by
              the DPSA. The concerns of the DPSA are being addressed in  the
              current preparation process.


         3. The Auditor-General has not signed off on all  financials.  This
              delay was caused partly by  ongoing  discussions  between  the
              Auditor-General's office and the Office  of  the  CFO  on  the
              audit qualification and a request to write-off monies  in  the
              suspense account.


         4. In addition, network failures caused  by  a  virus  resulted  in
              loss  of  critical  information  and  data.   Some   of   this
              information was available only in electronic format and had to
              be reconstructed. This frustrated  attempts  to  finalise  the
              annual report on time.
         Steps are being taken to prevent a recurrence of this  problem  and
         I have instructed the Director-General to take all necessary  steps
         to ensure that the Department's annual report is ready for  tabling
         in Parliament during October 2003.


         Best regards,

     Dear Madam Speaker


     TABLING OF ANNUAL REPORT 2002/03 OF THE DEPARTMENT OF  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS

     In terms of section 65(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, I
     as the Executive Authority for Department of  Foreign  Affairs,  should
     have tabled the Department's annual report and financial statements  in
     the National Assembly within six months after the end of the  financial
     year, 30 September 2003.
     The reason for the delay in the tabling is that the Department  had  to

     the Department and government in general.


     This written explanation is submitted in terms of section 65(2) of  the

         relation to the investigation into the disclosures  of  the  Deputy

         I have accepted the findings  and  recommendations  of  the  Public
         Protector and will ask the Secretary to Cabinet to  attend  to  the
         procedural shortcomings highlighted by the Public Protector.


         Yours sincerely,

     Letter from the Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry to  the  Speaker
     of the National Assembly, in terms of section 65(2)(a)  of  the  Public
     Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining  the  delay
     in the tabling of annual reports:


     Madam Speaker


     TABLING OF ANNUAL REPORTS FOR 2001/2002
     Your letter dated 19 November 2001 refers.


     In terms of section 65(1)(a) of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,
     1999, Annual Reports and Financial Statements of public entities (which
     include Water Boards) must be tabled within six months of  the  end  of
     the financial year. In terms  of  Section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Act,  the
     Minister must, upon failure to table the Annual Reports  and  Financial
     Statements within six months of the end of the financial year, table  a
     written explanation in Parliament to give reasons  why  they  were  not
     tabled.


     To date, the Annual Reports of the following  Water  Boards  have  been
     received and tabled in Parliament:


         Albany Coast Water Board Amatola Water Board
         Bloem Water   Botshelo (former North West Water Supply Authority)
         Ikangala Water      Lepelle Northern Water
         Magalies Water      Mhlathuze Water
         Namakwa Water Overberg Water; and
         Pelladrift Water    Rand Water
         Sedibeng (former Goudveld Water)    Umgeni Water


     The Bushbuckridge Water Board was the remaining Water Board, which  did
     not submit its Annual Report as yet. The reason was that the Board  was
     facing financial constraints during that period hence  the  report  was
     produced at a later stage.

     MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS AND FORESTRY

     (Act No 12 of 2003).

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter dated 29 September  2003,  from  the  Minister  for  the  Public
     Service and Administration to the Speaker of the National Assembly,  in
     terms of section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance  Management  Act,  1999
     (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the delay in the tabling  of  the  South
     African Management Development Institute's (SAMDI) annual report:


     Dear Madam Speaker


     SAMDI's annual report


     In terms of Section 65(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, I
     must table in the National Assembly the  annual  report  and  financial
     statements and the audit report on those statements, within  one  month
     after the accounting officer for  the  department  received  the  audit
     report.


     In terms of Section 40(1)(c) of the PFMA the accounting officer  for  a
     department must submit annual financial statements  within  two  months
     after the end of the financial year to the Auditor-General for auditing
     (i.e. 31 May of each year). SAMDI was only able to submit the mentioned
     statements for 2002/03 on 12 August 2003 due  to  capacity  and  system
     challenges.


     A preliminary detailed audit commenced in April 2003, which enabled the
     Office of the Auditor-General  to  complete  a  major  portion  of  the
     2002/03 audit. The Auditor-General  was  only  awaiting  the  financial
     statements to submit the final audit report  by  31  August  2003.  The
     current CFO started on 1 June 2003 and  was  able  to  fast  track  the
     process to prepare annual financial statements for both  the  Vote  and
     the Training Trading Account for 2002/03. This enabled SAMDI to  submit
     the signed financial statements to the Office of the Auditor-General on
     12 August 2003, thus allowing sufficient time for  the  Auditor-General
     to complete the audit within the prescribed time limit being 31  August
     2003.


     The Office of the Auditor-General outsourced the  audits  of  both  the
     Vote and the Trading Account  to  an  external  service  provider.  The
     external service provider disagreed with the treatment of  a  provision
     made in the financial  statements,  and  this  resulted  in  a  dispute
     between external service provider and National Treasury  regarding  the
     treatment of abovementioned provision amounting to R 1.1 million.  This
     process and dispute caused a delay in the finalisation of the Audit. It
     can be mentioned  that  the  external  service  provider  and  National
     Treasury agreed, in the end, that the  financial  statements  of  SAMDI
     were correct.


     Due to the abovementioned delays, the external  service  provider  will
     only be able to submit the final audit reports during mid-October  2003
     to the Auditor-General. This will result in a delayed  Audit  Committee
     meeting to approve the Annual Financial Statements, audit  reports  and
     to  finalise  the  Audit  Committee  report  on  the  Annual  Financial
     Statements and the Auditor-General's report. It is envisaged that  this
     meeting of the Audit Committee can only take place  during  mid-October
     2003. Therefore, the final Annual  Report  can  only  be  submitted  to
     myself by 31/10/2003, after which it can be printed.


     It is therefore envisaged that the  Annual  Report  of  SAMDI  will  be
     tabled by the end of November 2003.


     Kind regards,




     Signed
     G J Fraser-Moleketi
     MINISTER

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Social Development on the  Social
     Assistance Bill [B 57 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec  76),  dated  15
     October 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Social  Development,  having  considered
         the subject of the Social Assistance Bill [B 57 -  2003]  (National
         Assembly - sec 76), referred to it  and  classified  by  the  Joint
         Tagging Mechanism as a section  76  Bill,  reports  the  Bill  with
         amendments [B 57A - 2003].

2.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Provincial and  Local  Government
     on the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework  Bill  [B  58  -
     2003] (National Assembly - sec 76), dated 28 October 2003:


     The Portfolio Committee on  Provincial  and  Local  Government,  having
     considered the subject of the  Traditional  Leadership  and  Governance
     Framework Bill [B 58 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76), referred  to
     it and classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section 76  Bill,
     reports the Bill with amendments [B 58A - 2003].


     The Committee reports further, as follows:


     1.     The Committee received a very wide range of submissions  on  the
         Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill during  public
         hearings. On the one  hand,  there  were  traditional  leaders  who
         argued that the Bill should not be proceeded with. They  held  that
         the Constitution  should  first  be  amended  to  give  traditional
         authorities the same powers and functions as local government,  and
         thereafter legislation should be passed to  give  practical  effect
         to this. On the other hand, there were statutory bodies,  NGOs  and
         community organisations that had reservations about  the  Bill  and
         argued that it is a retreat from democracy and serves to  undermine
         the rights of women. In  between  these  organisations  there  were
         others that welcomed the basic thrust of the  Bill,  even  if  they
         had reservations about some of its clauses.


     2.     The Committee was challenged to find consensus among  this  wide
         range of stakeholders and to seek to locate this  consensus  within
         the policies of our respective  political  parties  on  traditional
         leadership.


     3.     In response to the traditional leaders,  the  Committee  pointed
         out that while constitutional  amendments  are  not  made  lightly,
         they cannot be  ruled  out  altogether  either  in  addressing  the
         issues they raised. But the major issues  in  the  White  Paper  on
         Traditional Leadership  and  Governance  and  the  Bill  should  be
         proceeded with. As it is a section 76  Bill,  there  will  also  be
         considerable input from the  provinces.  If,  at  the  end  of  the
         process of taking the  Bill  through  both  Houses  of  Parliament,
         there is significant consensus  between  the  traditional  leaders,
         SALGA  and  other  key  stakeholders  that  there  is  a  need  for
         constitutional  amendments,  the  parliamentary   committees   will
         consider proposing to the executive that it considers this.


     4.      In  response  to   statutory   bodies,   NGOs   and   community
         organisations, the Committee pointed  out  that  the  role  of  the
         traditional leadership in our  society  is  certainly  reconcilable
         with  the  basic  principles  and  values  of   our   Constitution,
         including  democracy  and   gender   equality.   After   all,   the
         institution of  traditional  leadership  is  provided  for  in  the
         Constitution. The Bill in fact provides for the  transformation  of
         the institution of traditional leadership so that it is  consistent
         with the needs of our new democracy. But it has to  be  appreciated
         that, while customs and traditions are  not  static,  they  have  a
         momentum  of  their  own.  It  is  far  more  difficult  to  effect
         transformation through legislation  in  the  areas  of  custom  and
         tradition than it is in other  aspects  of  society,  for  example,
         education, the economy or health care. Transformation in the  areas
         of custom and tradition have to be phased in appropriately.


     5.      It  was  pointed  out  to  all  stakeholders  that  traditional
         leadership is a concurrent  function  of  national  and  provincial
         government. The Bill therefore could not  be  unduly  prescriptive.
         It seeks, in fact, to provide a national framework  and  norms  and
         standards in terms of which provincial legislation will be  enacted
         that will take into account provincial specifics.


     6.     It was further communicated that this Bill deals with  the  role
         and functions of traditional leadership  in  governance  generally.
         The specific  role  and  functions  of  traditional  leadership  in
         different   areas,   for   example,   customary    justice,    land
         administration and welfare, will be dealt with  by  the  respective
         Ministries, Departments and Portfolio Committees.  In  response  to
         several questions raised  by  stakeholders  during  and  after  the
         public hearings, the Committee made it clear  that  the  Bill  does
         not specify any particular role for  traditional  leaders  in  land
         administration. However, shortly before  the  finalisation  of  the
         Bill, the Communal Land Rights Bill was introduced  in  Parliament,
         containing a new clause that provides for traditional  councils  to
         serve as land administration committees. Several stakeholders  have
         raised objections with the Committee to this role  for  traditional
         councils. We have explained, however, that  we  did  not  have  any
         prior knowledge that the  traditional  councils  would  serve  this
         particular role in the particular way set out in the Communal  Land
         Rights Bill. We  appreciate  the  concerns  the  stakeholders  have
         raised, but feel that their concerns cannot  be  addressed  in  the
         Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill but will  have
         to be dealt with in the Communal Land Rights Bill. Accordingly,  we
         have referred them to the Portfolio Committee  on  Agriculture  and
         Land  Affairs,  and  have  also  raised  their  concerns  with  the
         Chairperson of that Committee directly.


     7.     The Committee urged all  stakeholders  to  appreciate  that  the
         processing of this Bill represents a phase in the  ongoing  process
         of defining the role of traditional leaders in our  new  system  of
         democratic governance. The Bill is a  significant  advance  on  the
         Bill brought to Parliament in November 2000 that was not  proceeded
         with for a variety of reasons. Not  all  the  demands  of  all  the
         stakeholders could be met in the finalisation of the current  Bill.
         All stakeholders should be prepared to compromise  in  this  phase.
         This does not  mean  that  they  cannot  pursue  their  outstanding
         demands in future.


     8.     The amendments to the Bill made by the Committee constitute,  we
         think, an intricate set of balances  of  the  demands  of  the  key
         stakeholders.  Essentially,  they  revolve  around   simultaneously
         enhancing the  role  of  traditional  leadership  institutions  and
         requiring them to be more transformative. This  is  reflected,  for
         example, in providing for Bills  pertaining  to  customary  law  or
         customs to be first referred to the National House  of  Traditional
         Leaders for 30 days for its comments before Parliament can  process
         them. But we have also provided for 40%, instead  of  the  original
         25%, of the members of traditional councils  to  be  democratically
         elected, and for the transitional period for  existing  tribal  and
         community authorities to transform to be substantially reduced.


     9.      Traditional  leaders  and  others  see  the  word  "chief"   as
         derogatory and find it unacceptable. The  Ministry  and  Department
         proposed, with  reservations,  replacing  "chief"  with  "principal
         traditional leader". After much discussion  the  Committee  finally
         opted for "senior traditional leader", with the understanding  that
         the provincial legislation to be enacted will  use  the  applicable
         traditional term, such as inkosi, kgoshi, morena, etc.


     10.    Traditional leaders stressed that the Bill refers only to  their
         "functions",  not  "powers".  They  wanted  their  "powers"  to  be
         restored. The Committee pointed out that  the  Constitution  refers
         only to the "role" of  traditional  leadership.  The  Ministry  and
         Department of Provincial and Local Government  explained  that  the
         Bill  does  not  take  away  any  of  the  "customary  powers"   of
         traditional leaders and  actually  provides  additional  "statutory
         functions". Moreover, the Bill provides for a role for  traditional
         leadership, not just in the local government  sphere,  but  in  all
         three spheres of government.


     11.    The primary focus of the local houses of traditional leaders  is
         to engage with district municipalities  around  issues  of  service
         delivery and development in traditional authority areas. To  ensure
         an effective role in this, local houses of traditional leaders  are
         not required, in terms of the Bill, to be unduly  involved  in  the
         recognition of traditional  leaders,  traditional  communities  and
         traditional councils and  other  related  issues.  In  this  sense,
         their role is not the exact equivalent of the  role  of  provincial
         houses  of  traditional  leaders  and   the   National   House   of
         Traditional Leaders.


     12.    Ideally, the majority  in  the  Committee  believe,  traditional
         leaders should not be involved in political  parties.  They  should
         be non-partisan if they are to  effectively  play  their  roles  as
         traditional leaders. Their vital roles  in  creating  unity,  peace
         and harmony within and between communities is undermined  by  being
         active in political parties. However, the Committee recognises  the
         particular history of this country and acknowledges that  for  some
         time to come  traditional  leaders  will  be  active  in  political
         parties. Over time, however, traditional  leaders  should  consider
         increasingly withdrawing  from  party  politics  if  they  want  to
         effectively   fulfil   their   roles   as   traditional    leaders.
         Consideration might have to be given to  mechanisms  to  facilitate
         this over time.


     13.    The  Committee  is  uneasy  about  the  provision  for  "deputy"
         traditional leaders in the Bill, as there is already provision  for
         "acting" traditional leaders. However, in  view  of  the  intricate
         negotiations between the Ministry and  Department  and  traditional
         leaders  on  the  issue  of  "deputy"  traditional   leaders,   the
         Committee decided to retain the provision for "deputy"  traditional
         leaders.


     14.    While the provisions for the transformation of  the  institution
         of traditional  leadership  so  that  it  is  consistent  with  the
         Constitution, in particular  its  democratic  and  gender  equality
         aspects, are adequate for now, they may not be in future. The  Bill
         should therefore be reviewed over time to take account of this.  In
         particular,  the  issue  of  gender  equality  as  it  applies   to
         succession of traditional leaders needs to  be  addressed  further.
         This issue could not be dealt with adequately in the  current  Bill
         for a variety of reasons, and requires  further  consultation  with
         traditional leaders  and  other  key  stakeholders  before  further
         regulation is provided for.


     15.    In view of the role of traditional councils in  development  and
         service delivery, it would be useful if some of the people  elected
         to the councils are chosen  because  of  the  developmental  skills
         they have.


     16.    Since the pre-1994 legislation refers to "tribes", the  drafters
         of the Bill  were  forced  in  a  few  sections  to  use  the  word
         "tribes". As the majority in the Committee believe that it  is  not
         an appropriate  term,  it  has  been  used  only  where  completely
         unavoidable and in a transitional context.  The  term  is  used  in
         quotation marks to convey this.
     17.    Several submissions made at the public hearings  and  thereafter
         dealt  with  disputes  around   who   constitutes   a   traditional
         community, the geographical boundaries of a traditional  community,
         the succession of traditional leaders  and  other  related  issues.
         These  submissions  will  be  referred   to   the   Commission   on
         Traditional  Leadership  Disputes  and  Claims  as   soon   as   it
         established. There have  been  several  provincial  commissions  of
         inquiry  established  since   1994   to   investigate   traditional
         leadership disputes and claims. Some of the matters they have  been
         investigating, have not yet been finalised. The  Commission  to  be
         established in terms of this Bill should consider addressing  these
         outstanding matters as soon as possible.  The  Committee  is  clear
         that while the Commission will focus mainly on disputes and  claims
         arising since the enactment of  the  Black  Administration  Act  of
         1927, there are disputes and claims  that  predate  this  Act  that
         will also require the Commission's attention.


     18.    A legislative programme is necessary to  attend  to  outstanding
         issues from the White Paper and as a consequence of the passing  of
         this Bill. This would include the following:


         *    Provincial   legislation   on   traditional   leadership   and
           governance.


         *  The amendment of  the  legislation  on  the  National  House  of
           Traditional  Leaders  and  the  various  Provincial  Houses   of
           Traditional Leaders.


         *  Regulations required to be passed in terms of this Bill.


         *  Amendments to section 81 of the Municipal Structures Act.


         *  Amendments to legislation dealing with the pension, medical  aid
           and other benefits of traditional leaders.


         *   Legislation  assigning  additional  functions  to   traditional
           leadership as envisaged  in  the  White  Paper,  where  this  is
           necessary.


     19.    There will also have to be a repeal of or amendments to pre-1994
         legislation dealing with traditional leadership.


     20.    In allocating functions to traditional leadership  institutions,
         the capacity of the institutions has to be taken into account.


     21.    The State Liability Act does not cover traditional institutions.
         The relevant provincial legislation does not address the  liability
         of traditional leadership comprehensively either. This needs to  be
         addressed by the Ministry and Department. Consideration  should  be
         given to doing so in the provincial legislation to  be  enacted  in
         terms of this Bill.


     22.    The Committee has observed that some royal families are divided,
         and this  may  impact  on  the  implementation  of  the  Bill.  The
         Committee does not  believe  at  this  stage  it  is  necessary  to
         legislate on this  matter,  but  in  future,  if  necessary,  after
         consultation with traditional leaders and other  key  stakeholders,
         consideration might have to be given to this.


     23.    The Ministry and Department  need  to  consider  what  practical
         steps can be taken to co-ordinate the activities of  the  National,
         Provincial and Local Houses  of  Traditional  leaders.  There  also
         needs to be a level of co-ordination between  traditional  councils
         and the Houses.


     24.    Obviously, the Khoisan communities  have  enormously  legitimate
         claims to rights in terms of customs and tradition. But  they  have
         specific needs and interests that are still  being  dealt  with  by
         the Ministry and Department, and it was  not  possible  to  address
         them in this Bill. Our Committee has  constantly  raised  with  the
         Department the concerns of the Khoisan communities. While there  is
         progress in this regard, we would like to see  more  progress.  For
         now, the Khoisan communities have to be  treated  separately.  Over
         time, there should be more dialogue between the National  House  of
         Traditional Leaders and  the  Khoisan  Council,  and  consideration
         should be given in the longer term to  including  all  sections  of
         traditional leaders in one national structure. The  Committee  will
         continue to monitor  progress  relating  to  the  concerns  of  the
         Khoisan communities as they apply to rights  in  terms  of  customs
         and tradition.


     25.     In  the  memorandum  to  the  Bill,  the  cost  per  annum   of
         establishing  Local  Houses  of  Traditional  Leaders  is  put   at
         R33 303 074 and the Commission on Traditional  Leadership  Disputes
         and Claims at R8 528 895. A further R60 476 548 has been  allocated
         for the remuneration of headmen and  headwomen  who  are  currently
         not being paid. The Committee feels that  there  are  other  costs,
         including  those  for  traditional  councils  and  the  Houses   of
         Traditional Leaders, that have not been catered for. There is  also
         concern that more people will  claim  to  be  traditional  leaders,
         particularly as headmen and headwomen, and demand the  remuneration
         that goes with it, than has been provided for in the  estimates  of
         expenditure tabled by the Department. The Committee feels that  the
         Department  should  consider  phasing  in  aspects   of   the   new
         traditional leadership dispensation taking into  account  budgetary
         constraints.


     26.    The Committee is also concerned that  there  may  be  situations
         where councillors in a municipality  earn  less  than  headmen  and
         headwomen and senior traditional leaders, and that  this  may  lead
         to  conflict.  The  Committee   reiterates   its   concerns   about
         councillors' salaries expressed in its "Report  on  Study  Tour  of
         Municipalities" which appeared in the  ATC  of  13  May  2003,  and
         feels that this is yet another reason why some  of  those  concerns
         should be addressed expeditiously. The Ministry and Department  are
         requested to take this into account.


     27.    In view of the State's commitment to providing greater resources
         to, and enhancing the capacity-building programmes of,  traditional
         leaders, there is a  need  for  the  Executive  and  Parliament  to
         monitor  the  activities  of  traditional  leadership  institutions
         appropriately. Over  time,  consideration  needs  to  be  given  to
         bringing the traditional leadership institutions within  the  ambit
         of the Public Finance Management Act.

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter dated 27 October 2003, from the Minister  of  Transport  to  the
     Speaker of the National Assembly, in terms of section 65(2)(a)  of  the
     Public Finance Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining  the
     delay in the tabling of the following annual reports:


         Madam Speaker,


         Cross Border Road Transport Agency


         The provisional financial statements of the Agency  were  finalised
         and submitted for audit  within  two  months  of  the  end  of  the
         financial year.


         During  the  audit  review,  the  Office  of  the   Auditor-General
         identified  several  errors  and   omissions   in   the   financial
         statements. The  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  the  Agency  worked
         closely with the Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to  rectify  and
         finalise the financial  statements.  The  process  that  ensued  to
         rectify the  errors  and  omissions  on  the  financial  statements
         caused a delay in the finalisation of the audit and  annual  report
         within the prescribed timeframes.


         Urban Transport Fund


         The audit for 2003 was delayed due to the late finalisation of  the
         audit of the previous two years.  The  combined  audit  report  for
         2002 and 2001 was only finalised and delivered on 1  October  2003.
         By the end of September 2003 the audit  report  for  the  financial
         year ended 31 March 2003 was not yet received.  The  annual  report
         could therefore not be finalised within the prescribed timeframes.


         South African National Roads Agency Ltd.


         The financial statements were finalised  and  submitted  for  audit
         within two months of the end of the financial year.


         The Board of the  Agency  approved  the  financial  statements,  as
         adjusted during the completion of the audit, on 5 August  2003.  By
         the end of September 2003 the audit report was  not  yet  received.
         The annual report could  therefore  not  be  finalised  within  the
         prescribed timeframes.


         South African Maritime Safety Authority


         The audit for the previous year  was  delayed  due  to  a  forensic
         audit that was  instituted  within  the  Authority.  The  Authority
         requested the Office of the Auditor-General to finalise  the  audit
         for the previous year even though the forensic audit  has  not  yet
         been finalised.


         Because of the delay in the finalisation  of  the  previous  year's
         audit, the audit for the year ended 31 March  2003  only  commenced
         on 4 August 2003. By the end of September  2003  the  audit  report
         was not yet received. The annual  report  could  therefore  not  be
         finalised within the prescribed timeframes.


         Road Accident Fund


         The provision for outstanding claims has a material impact  on  the
         financial statements of  the  Road  Accident  Fund.  The  actuarial
         valuation of outstanding claims is a  time-consuming  process  done
         by  external  actuaries,  and  was  not  finalised  on   time   for
         finalising the financial statements within two months  of  the  end
         of the financial year.


         The delay  in  the  finalisation  of  the  actuarial  valuation  of
         outstanding claims caused  a  delay  in  the  finalisation  of  the
         audit. By the end of September 2003 the audit report  was  not  yet
         received. The  annual  report  could  therefore  not  be  finalised
         within the prescribed timeframes.


         Road Traffic Management Corporation


         The Road Traffic Management Corporation  was  listed  as  a  Public
         Entity and commenced activities during the financial year ended  31
         March 2003. Because the functions that should be  taken  over  from
         the Provincial Authorities by the Corporation were not  yet  agreed
         to, no financial support staff was appointed during the year.


         The  Department  of  Transport  arranged  for   the   creation   of
         accounting records and the  processing  of  financial  transactions
         and compiled the first financial statements of the  Corporation  in
         order to assist  the  Corporation  to  comply  with  the  reporting
         requirements of the Public Finance Management Act.


         The financial statements of  the  Corporation  were  submitted  for
         audit on 20 June 2003. By the  end  of  September  2003  the  audit
         report was not yet received. The annual report could therefore  not
         be finalised within the prescribed timeframes.


         Signed


         A M Omar, MP
         MINISTER OF TRANSPORT

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill  [B  57B  -  2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 5 November 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill  [B  57B  -
         2002] (National Assembly - sec 75) and a proposed amendment of  the
         National  Council  of  Provinces   (Announcements,   Tablings   and
         Committee Reports,  8  October  2003,  p  1279),  referred  to  the
         Committee, reports the Bill with an amendment [B 57C - 2002].


     Report to be considered.

2.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Judicial Matters Second Amendment Bill [B 41 - 2003]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 5 November 2003:


     The Portfolio Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,
     having considered the subject of the Judicial Matters Second  Amendment
     Bill [B 41 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 75),  referred  to  it  and
     classified by the  Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  as  a  section  75  Bill,
     endorses the classification of the  Bill  and  reports  the  Bill  with
     amendments [B 41A - 2003].


     The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


     1.     The amendments proposed to  section  10  of  the  Administration
         Amendment  Act,  1929  (Act  No.  9  of  1929),  have  alerted  the
         Committee  to  the  need  to   rationalise   the   Divorce   Courts
         established in terms  of  that  Act,  by  ensuring  that  they  are
         integrated into the existing lower  court  structures  as  soon  as
         possible. The Committee consequently  requests  the  Department  to
         speed up the rationalisation of the lower  courts,  one  aspect  of
         which  will  be  to  incorporate  these  Divorce  Courts  into  the
         magistrates' courts system. The Department is  to  report  back  to
         the Committee on progress in this regard within four  months  after
         the adoption of this report.


     2.     Clause 3 of the Bill, as introduced, amends section  60  of  the
         Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 (Act No.  51  of  1977),  by  obliging
         presiding  officers  to  take  a  pre-trial  services  report  into
         account during bail proceedings if such a report is available.  The
         purpose of a pre-trial services report is to assist  the  court  in
         making a decision regarding the release of a person on  bail.  This
         amendment emanates from a request of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
         Justice and Constitutional Development after its  oversight  visits
         to the courts, which included a visit to  some  courts  which  have
         pre-trial services available. The Committee, while agreeing to  the
         principle contained in  the  amendment,  expressed  the  view  that
         these pre-trial services and reports can be  of  immense  value  to
         the courts, especially in bail proceedings. If used to  their  full
         potential, they can contribute to the elimination of delays in  the
         courts and can also facilitate the release of  many  awaiting-trial
         prisoners who are granted bail but who  are  not  released  because
         they cannot afford to pay  the  amount  of  money  set  as  a  bail
         condition. This could go some way  in  addressing  the  problem  of
         prison  overcrowding.  The  Committee  consequently  requests   the
         Department -
         (a)     to  undertake  a  feasibility  study  of  rolling  out  the
              existing four  pilot  projects  sites  relating  to  pre-trial
              services with the view to eventually having comprehensive pre-
              trial services available at all courts in the  country,  where
              such services are justified; and


         (b)     possibly, in conjunction with the South African Law  Reform
              Commission, to -


              (i) investigate what statutory authority will be necessary  to
                    implement these services on a nation-wide basis; and


              (ii)     submit appropriate legislation to Parliament.


         The Department must report back  to  the  Committee  regarding  the
         progress made as soon as  possible,  but  not  later  than  at  the
         beginning of the 2004 session of Parliament.
     3.     At present section 79 of the Criminal Procedure Act,  1977  (Act
         No. 51 of 1977), in the case of serious offences, requires a  panel
         of psychiatrists to be appointed for  purposes  of  inquiring  into
         the  capacity  of  an  accused  person   to   understand   criminal
         proceedings pending  against  him  or  her  or  into  the  criminal
         capacity of an  accused  person,  where  mental  incapacity  is  an
         issue. This panel must consist of  at  least  three  psychiatrists,
         one from a  psychiatric  hospital  designated  by  the  court,  one
         appointed by the court who is not in the full-time service  of  the
         State and one appointed by the court for the accused. This  section
         also requires the Department of Health to compile and keep  a  list
         of psychiatrists who are  prepared  to  conduct  the  inquiries  in
         question, which list must be made available to  the  registrars  of
         all High Courts and clerks of all magistrates' courts.  During  its
         deliberations  on  the  Bill,  as  introduced  in  Parliament,  the
         Committee was requested to consider the insertion of  a  clause  in
         the Bill which is intended to address very real practical  problems
         being  experienced  with  the  application  of  this  section.  The
         Committee was informed that there are very  few  psychiatrists  who
         are willing to  make  themselves  available  for  purposes  of  the
         section, notwithstanding a recent increase in the tariffs  paid  to
         them for their services. The list kept by the Department of  Health
         also seems to be a source of  concern,  the  information  contained
         therein sometimes being outdated. The amendment tabled  before  the
         Committee for consideration was intended to introduce a measure  of
         flexibility in respect of the panel, giving the court a  discretion
         to deviate from having three psychiatrists in  all  serious  cases.
         The Committee, while understanding the urgency of  the  matter,  is
         of the opinion that the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional
         Development, in conjunction with the relevant role-players,  should
         be requested  to  table  a  report  before  the  Committee  at  the
         earliest opportunity but not later than three months from the  date
         of adoption of this Report, in which the following is included:


         (a)     Information on how often the list referred  to  in  section
              79(9) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977, is updated;


         (b)      information  on  the  difficulties  experienced   by   the
              Department of Health in keeping the list;


         (c)     the manner in which  the  difficulties  could  possibly  be
              addressed;


         (d)     the nature of the difficulties experienced by the  National
              Prosecuting Authority in  applying  the  said  section  79  in
              practice;


         (e)     information on section 79 prior to its  amendment  in  1998
              and why the amendments were brought about in that year; and


         (f)     appropriate amending legislation, if necessary,  which  has
              been the subject of proper consultation.


         The Committee is of the view that if amendments do  in  fact  prove
         to be necessary after the above issues have been attended to,  such
         amendments should be promoted as soon as possible, possibly at  the
         beginning of 2004.


     Report to be considered.

         the delay in the tabling of the Annual Report of the Presidency:


         Dear Madam Speaker


         LATE SUBMISSION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PRESIDENCY


         Due to various technical problems during the printing process,  the
         submission of the Annual Report of the Presidency  for  tabling  in
         Parliament has been delayed for more than a month.  The  main  (but
         not the only) problem was that  the  printers  initially  delivered
         the report with serious errors in the  design  and  colour  of  the
         cover of the report. The cover then had to be  reprinted,  and  the
         defective covers replaced.


         Kindly accept our apology for the delay.


         Yours sincerely
         Signed


         Essop Pahad
         Minister in the Presidency


     (c)    Letter dated 3  November  2003,  from  the  Minister  of  Social
         Development to the Speaker of the National Assembly,  in  terms  of
         section 65(2)(a) of the Public Finance Management  Act,  1999  (Act
         No 1 of 1999), explaining the delay in the tabling  of  the  Annual
         Report of the National Development Agency for 2002-2003:


         Dear Madam


         EXPLANATION ON THE  LATE  SUBMISSION  AND  TABLING  OF  THE  ANNUAL
         REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT  AGENCY
         (NDA) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2003


         The National Development Agency (NDA) is a Public  Entity  that  is
         listed as a Schedule 3A of the Public Finance Management Act,  1999
         (Act No 1 of  1999)  [PFMA]  and  reports  directly  to  me  in  my
         capacity as its Executive Authority.


         In terms of section 65(1)(a) of the PFMA, I am compelled  to  table
         in  the  National  Assembly  the  Annual   Report   and   Financial
         Statements of my department and public entities  reporting  to  me.
         Sub-section  (2)(a)  further  requires  me  to  table   a   written
         explanation in Parliament in circumstances where  I  am  unable  to
         table such reports within six months of the end  of  the  financial
         year (i.e. 30 September 2003), setting out  the  reasons  why  they
         were not tabled.


         In this regard I would like to report that I  am  unable  to  table
         the annual report and audited financial statements of the  NDA  for
         the year ended 31 March 2003 for the following reasons:


         1. The NDA failed to furnish the Auditor-General  with  its  annual
              financial statements by 31 May 2003  as  required  by  section
              55(1)(c) of the PFMA. The financial statements were  initially
              submitted on 30 May 2003 and were found to contain a number of
              errors and were referred back to the management of the NDA for
              correction. The revised statements were submitted on  31  July
              2003  and  still  contained  some  errors.  Consequently,  the
              Auditor-General could not be able to finalise  the  audit  and
              issue  his  Audit  Report.  The  reason  given  by  the  NDA's
              accounting officer was that the Financial Director of the  NDA
              was put on suspension  during  this  critical  period  of  the
              audit.


         2. Following the suspension of the Financial Director, the Head  of
              Internal Audit who was  then  appointed  as  Acting  Financial
              Director also tendered his resignation from the  organisation.
              This was  immediately  followed  by  the  resignation  of  the
              Financial  Manager  who  reports  directly  to  the  Financial
              Director.


         3.  Towards  the  end  of  August  2003,  serious  allegations   of
              financial mismanagement, conflict  of  interests,  impropriety
              and nepotism were leveled against the Chief Executive  Officer
              (CEO) of the NDA. On  account  of  the  seriousness  of  these
              allegations,   I   commissioned   a    preliminary    forensic
              investigation into these allegations under the auspices of the
              Auditor-General's Office.  Preliminary  findings  collaborated
              most of these allegations and I then took the decision to  put
              the CEO  on  precautionary  suspension  with  effect  from  27
              October 2003 to  allow  the  forensic  investigating  team  to
              conduct a detailed forensic audit into these matters.


         I am setting up a  management  team  consisting  of  mainly  senior
         officials  from  my  department,  under  the  supervision  of   the
         Director-General, to go and assist the management  of  the  NDA  in
         bringing back sound management practices in  that  organisation.  I
         expect that the annual report of the NDA  and  its  audited  annual
         financial statements will then be ready for tabling  in  Parliament
         by February 2004.


         King regards,




         Signed


         Dr Z S T Skweyiya, MP
         MINISTER

2.    The Speaker:


     Report of Delegation to 6th Session  of  African,  Caribbean,  Pacific-
     European Union Joint Parliamentary Assembly,  Rome,  Italy,  11  to  15
     October 2003.


     The 6th Session of the African, Caribbean, Pacific-European Union Joint
     Parliamentary Assembly (ACP-EU JPA) met in Rome, Italy from  11  to  15
     October 2003. As usual, the joint plenary was preceded by a meeting  of
     the ACP and also of the three Standing Committees  established  at  the
     5th session - on Political Affairs, on  Economic  Development,  Finance
     and Trade and on Social Affairs and  the  Environment.  The  delegation
     consisted of Dr. Rob Davies and Ms Ntshadi Tsheole (ANC) and  Mr  Colin
     Eglin (DA). We were accompanied by Ambassadors Jerry Matjila and  Lenin
     Shope, accredited to the EU and Italy respectively, Mr  Saul  Pelle  of
     the South African Embassy to the EU in Brussels, Ms  Clara  Kiesewetter
     of the  Embassy  in  Rome  and  Mr  Grant  Fredericks  of  Parliament's
     International Relations division.


     The 6th Session was the first to operate according to the new rules  of
     procedure adopted at the fifth session. These provide  for  resolutions
     to be tabled via the Standing Committees with the possibility  of  only
     two "urgent resolutions" per  session  being  tabled  independently  on
     topics agreed  by  the  Joint  Bureau.  The  motivation  for  this  new
     procedure is to encourage the JPA to focus its attention on the  common
     issues of ACP-EU relations, rather than the bilateral issues that  have
     in the past, in practice, dominated JPA proceedings.  The  6th  Session
     was also the first held in Europe to be at the seat of the rotating  EU
     presidency rather than at one of the seats of the  European  Parliament
     (Brussels, Strasbourg or Luxemburg). A proposal to  shift  sessions  to
     the seat of the EU presidency has been on the table for some time,  but
     was given an added impetus following the impasse on the  issue  of  the
     refusal last November by  the  European  Parliament  to  allow  on  its
     premises members of the Zimbabwean delegation on the travel  ban  list,
     who were nevertheless admitted into Belgium on  the  grounds  that  the
     travel  ban  rules  exempt  participants  in  bona  fide  international
     meetings. This issue led to the failure to convene the JPA in  Brussels
     last year, and if it had not been resolved, threatened all  future  JPA
     meetings in Europe. An ACP delegation to Zimbabwe  also  reported  that
     the  Zimbabwe  Speaker  had  agreed  to  appoint  delegations  to  JPAs
     consisting of persons not on the travel ban list (see below).  Minister
     Paul Mangwana (who is on the travel  ban  list)  was  present,  but  as
     "technical advisor" to the delegation comprised of parliamentarians not
     on the list.


     The ACP plenary, apart from  the  routine  business  of  reviewing  the
     agenda of the JPA, dealt with two other matters of substance. The first
     was the tabling of the  report  of  an  ACP  delegation  which  visited
     Zimbabwe in September. This was led by the ACP co-President, Mr  Adrien
     Houngbedji, and included Ms Ntshadi Tsheole. The report indicated  that
     the main aims of the mission were to examine "alongside the authorities
     in Zimbabwe, the situation created following the  cancellation  of  the
     5th JPA session" and  "explore  a  common  strategy  for  ensuring  the
     effective participation of Zimbabwean parliamentarians in the 6th JPA".
     The  mission  was  also  to  "afford  the  delegation  the  opportunity
     [of]_assessing the political and economic situation" in  Zimbabwe.  The
     report concluded, inter alia, that "The present  political  and  social
     problems being experienced by Zimbabwe are,  to  a  large  extent,  the
     result of the agrarian reforms being undertaken  in  the  country_[and]
     sanctions imposed by the EU and other  donors  are  having  an  adverse
     effect on the country's development". The report  also  indicated  that
     "The Speaker of Parliament undertook to adopt the necessary measures to
     ensure that Zimbabwe was henceforth represented by parliamentarians who
     are not blacklisted by the EU, in spite of the sovereign right of  each
     country to determine who should  represent  it  at  JPA  meetings".  It
     furthermore spoke of the ACP mission "paving the way for  a  joint  JPA
     fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe". After some debate, in which somewhat
     different views were expressed, the report was accepted by the  ACP  on
     the understanding that its formal tabling was to  the  ACP  alone.  The
     Joint Bureau, however, agreed that there would be a debate on  Zimbabwe
     in the joint session, although no resolutions would be tabled. The  ACP
     will table an "urgent resolution" on Zimbabwe at the 7th JPA.  Although
     the report was formally tabled only  to  the  ACP,  its  contents  were
     communicated by the co-President to the joint bureau and  it  was  much
     discussed in the debate in the joint session. Most MEPs disagreed  with
     the assertion  that  Zimbabwe's  problems  with  the  EU  fundamentally
     originated in a bilateral disagreement with the former colonial  power,
     Britain, over the latter's reneging on commitments  made  at  Lancaster
     House to support land reform. They argued that the crisis had gone much
     further and was fundamentally a matter of human rights  and  democracy.
     They generally, however, welcomed the idea of a joint mission  provided
     that its terms of reference were acceptable to them. Ms Ntshadi Tsheole
     took the floor for our delegation, arguing that all  major  players  in
     Zimbabwe had committed themselves to a process of dialogue and that the
     role of outsiders was to facilitate and encourage Zimbabweans  to  find
     solutions to the acute problems facing them. Several ACP speakers spoke
     of the challenge being for the EU to find ways to assist  this  process
     and arguing that sanctions and embargoes were the wrong way to go.


     The second substantive issue in the ACP  meeting  was  the  hosting  by
     Ethiopia of the 7th JPA. Eritrea  objected  saying  that  Ethiopia  had
     rejected some of the findings of the boundary commission set  up  after
     the border war between the two countries, despite the provisions of the
     peace agreement that the  commission's  findings  would  be  final  and
     binding. We, along with most other ACP delegations, took the  floor  to
     argue that a meeting of the JPA in Addis Ababa would not mean endorsing
     any position on the boundary commission and that there were no  grounds
     for us to impose an embargo on Ethiopia. The 7th JPA  will  convene  in
     Ethiopia, but the joint bureau agreed to send a mission to  Eritrea  at
     around that time.


     The Standing Committees tabled three reports and resolutions  based  on
     these. The report and resolution of the Political Affairs Committee was
     on the issue of child soldiers, and a feature of the plenary debate  on
     this issue was the participation of Mr Olara Otunnu, the United Nations
     Secretary General's Special Representative.  The  Committee  on  Social
     Affairs  and  the  Environment  tabled  a  report  and  resolution   on
     "Sustainable development and conservation of natural resources  in  ACP
     countries in the framework of the ninth European Development Fund".


     We are full members of the Standing Committee on Economic  Development,
     Finance and Trade  and  participated  in  the  Committee's  meeting  on
     October 11th. The Committee tabled  a  report  and  resolution  on  the
     proposed "budgetisation" of European Development Funds and the  use  of
     funds from  previous  EDFs  that  remain  unspent.  "Budgetisation"  is
     strongly supported by many MEPs on the grounds that  it  would  enhance
     oversight  and  decision-making  by  the   European   Parliament   (and
     potentially lay the ground for oversight by and input from the JPA) and
     also because they believe it  would  offer  a  more  secure  basis  for
     funding  than  the  present  approach   that   depends   on   voluntary
     contributions by individual member states. A minority of MEPs, however,
     are concerned that "budgetisation"  would  subject  EDF  funds  to  the
     "annuality" principle, which means if the  money  is  not  spent  in  a
     particular budget year it is lost, and could also be "raided" for other
     purposes as several budgeted funds  have  been  in  the  past  e.g.  to
     provide funds for Kossovo. The resolution did not take  any  stance  on
     this issue, but rather called for the pros and cons to be laid out  for
     debate at future JPAs. All of this takes place against a background  of
     a debate on unspent EDF funds. Various  estimates  put  the  amount  at
     between 2 and 10 billion Euros. This is not all  allocated  money,  and
     certainly no pot that can be dipped into, but is  reportedly  dampening
     the enthusiasm of EU countries to contribute voluntarily to a 10th EDF.


     In addition, the Economic Development, Finance and Trade Committee  has
     as "work in progress" a report  on  the  Cotonou  Economic  Partnership
     Agreement negotiations.  These  have  now  entered  into  phase  two  -
     negotiations for EPAs with individual regions,  with  opening  sessions
     with West and Central Africa held early in October. The absence of  any
     all ACP-EU agreement at the end of the first phase (September 2003) was
     a cause of some disagreement and tension. A joint  Ministerial  meeting
     held on October 2nd, however, adopted a joint declaration and agreed on
     an all ACP-EU technical monitoring committee to  oversee  regional  EPA
     negotiations and work towards an all ACP-EU agreement at the end of the
     negotiating process - in 2007. We were told that  in  Southern  Africa,
     the negotiating group will  be  SADC  minus  MMZZ  (Mauritius,  Malawi,
     Zambia and Zimbabwe) with the DRC still to decide.  South  Africa  will
     participate fully in the process even though we have  a  separate  TDCA
     with the EU. MMZZ will join the Eastern African (Comesa-led) group. The
     draft Committee report spoke with concern of attempts to suggest that a
     WTO-compatible Free Trade Agreement must cover 90%  of  both  partners'
     trade (We pointed out that the TDCA only covers 85% of our imports). It
     also spoke  of  attempts  by  the  EU  to  "smuggle"  Singapore  issues
     (competition,   government   procurement,    investment    and    trade
     facilitation) into EPA negotiations.


     The Committee also had an opportunity to  exchange  views  on  the  WTO
     Cancun Ministerial meeting. The joint bureau identified Cancun and  its
     implications  for  EPAs  as  one  of  the  two   topics   for   "urgent
     resolutions". The plenary debate on this topic was, however,  not  very
     satisfactory. There were many speakers - too many from the  platform  -
     meaning that parliamentarians  from  the  floor  were  limited  to  two
     minutes. A feature of debates both in the Committee and  on  the  floor
     was an attempt by some EU officials to try to create  distance  between
     the G20 plus and other ACP  countries.  Mr  Adolfo  Urso,  the  Italian
     deputy minister who headed the European Council's delegation to Cancun,
     spoke of the G20  plus  as  an  "anti-thrust"  that  had  adopted  "too
     radical" positions and  "embittered  negotiations"  at  Cancun.  Others
     spoke in more measured tones of  the  G20  plus  not  representing  the
     poorest and it  being  their  concerns  that  should  command  priority
     attention. Several ACP delegations argued  that  the  priority  was  to
     defend preferences. Others,  however,  including  the  EU  co-President
     Glenys Kinnock spoke more positively of the G20 plus as having  changed
     the balance of forces more in favour of developing countries.  We  took
     the floor in the Committee to defend the positive role of the G20  plus
     and to argue that there  could  be  no  return  to  the  old  order  of
     preferences,  that  even  existing  EU   CAP   reforms   would   weaken
     preferences, and that the challenge was  to  defend  the  interests  of
     poorer countries that historically depended on  preferences  on  a  new
     terrain that would also deal with the negative impact  of  subsidies  -
     which, inter alia, were impacting negatively  on  West  African  cotton
     producers. We also took the floor for 2 minutes in the plenary  debate.
     A compromise resolution was drawn up, with ACP input  coming  from  the
     secretariat. As usual a number of amendments were proposed  by  several
     groups. We proposed several that were adopted by the ACP. In the voting
     process, the ACP supported a number of amendments  from  EU  groups  in
     addition to its own and opposed several  from  the  conservative  (EPP)
     group, including on the Singapore issues. This led the EPP to call  for
     a vote by separate houses on the amended resolution after calling in  a
     number of their members who had  not  previously  participated  in  the
     proceedings. The ACP voted unanimously in favour, but  the  motion  was
     lost in the EU house meaning that the JPA failed to pass  a  resolution
     on Cancun and EPAs. Whether this could have been  avoided  by  the  ACP
     engaging more closely with the EPP, and  understanding  more  precisely
     their bottom line, is debatable. However, it is perhaps  an  indication
     of the distance between the ACP and the largest group in  the  European
     Parliament on, inter alia, the Singapore issues,  despite  attempts  to
     suggest that  the  EU  and  ACP  have  common  interests  in  rejecting
     pressures that would weaken preferences.


     The other "urgent topic" was  West  Africa,  where  the  focus  was  on
     Liberia, Ivory Coast and  Guinea-Bissau.  After  some  amendments,  the
     resolution on this matter was adopted by a large majority.


     In addition to the topics on the agenda, the bureau also  agreed  to  a
     debate on the International Criminal  Court,  particularly  to  express
     concern at attempts by the US to threaten to withdraw aid funds  unless
     recipients agree to exempt US citizens from the ICC. We took the  floor
     to speak in favour of the ICC and against US pressure in this regard.


     We also tabled two written questions - one to the ACP Council  and  the
     other to the Commission. The co-President, however, allowed  follow  up
     questions on the  Commissioner's  statement  to  take  precedence  over
     follow ups to written questions.


     There are a number of changes in the ACP leadership  of  the  JPA.  The
     term of office of the co-President ended at the conclusion of  the  6th
     JPA. On the principle of rotation, the co-Presidency for the  next  two
     years will be held by the Caribbean region. That region agreed that  Mr
     Sardjoe from Surinam will serve for one year, and Ms  Hay-Webster  from
     Jamaica for the second  year.  The  Southern  African  region's  bureau
     representatives were also rotated. On the  basis  of  the  alphabetical
     rotation, South Africa will replace Mozambique and serve for two years.


     The Bureau and the Committees are due  to  meet  in  Brussels  in  mid-
     January, and the 7th JPA in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,  provisionally  from
     16-19 February 2004. The reason for the earlier than usual convening of
     the 7th JPA is that there  will  be  elections  for  the  new  enlarged
     European Parliament shortly thereafter.
