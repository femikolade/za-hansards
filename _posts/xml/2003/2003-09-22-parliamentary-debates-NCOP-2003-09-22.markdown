 PLANS BY EXTREMIST GROUPS TO DISRUPT ELECTION CAMPAIGNS FOR 2004 ELECTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern that in terms of media reports -
       (a)  an elite group of former SADF and AWB members  are  planning  to
           disrupt the election campaigns in  the  run-up  to  next  year's
           elections;


       (b)  that the disruptions are intended to include gangsterism  and  a
           resurgence of the taxi violence; and


       (c)  that the group is recruiting new members with emphasis on people
           with military capabilities; and


  (2) calls on the Government to monitor the activists from  the  rightwing
       extremist groups country-wide in order to determine  their  potential
       threat to the country.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE EFFECTS OF REGULATION 15 ON SAPS MEMBERS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice as follows:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Regulation 15 of the SAPS Discipline Regulations, 1996, provides
           that -


           (i)   when there is an allegation of serious misconduct  against
                  a member of the SAPS and the circumstances are  such  that
                  he or she cannot be allowed to exercise his or her  powers
                  and to perform  his  or  her  duties  and  functions,  the
                  temporary transfer or suspension of  the  member  must  be
                  considered; and


           (ii)  when the temporary transfer is not a  viable  option,  the
                  suspension  of  the  member  is  considered  and  in  that
                  instance the suspension is without salary;


       (b)  the percentage of members suspended without pay whose employment
           was not permanently  terminated  upon  finalisation  of  charges
           against them during the period 1 April 2002 to 30 April 2003  is
           56,08%; and


       (c)  members on suspension without pay, even for lengthy periods - in
           some instances up to 48 months - are not financially assisted in
           respect of their own maintenance and that of their families; and


  (2) whereas members of the SAPS who  are  temporarily  suspended  without
       salary,  and  their  families,  suffer  extremely  severe   financial
       hardship (in many instances irreparably so), even in instances  where
       they are eventually found not  guilty  of  misconduct,  requests  the
       Minister for Safety and Security to have the effects of the operation
       of regulation  15  investigated  having  due  regard  to  the  severe
       financial  hardship  of  members  and  their   families   under   the
       circumstances mentioned.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             RAVAGING EFFECTS OF WINTER DROUGHT IN WESTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice as follows:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the ravaging effect the winter drought has had thus far upon the
           Western Cape;


       (b)  that professional  estimates  put  the  estimated  cost  of  the
           drought in the South Western Cape at R1,6 billion;


       (c)  that thus far there has  been  no  assistance  forthcoming  from
           either the central Government or the government of  the  Western
           Cape to any of  the  rural  communities  of  the  Swartland  and
           beyond; and


       (d)  that the situation in the Namaqualand  region  of  the  Northern
           Cape is equally critical; and


  (2) calls upon the Government  to  take  effective  action  in  order  to
       stabilise the situation in agriculture so that the negative impact of
       the drought upon the rural communities in the area in question can be
       reduced.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   SAD PASSING AWAY OF MEMBER, AND CONDOLENCES EXTENDED TO BEREAVED FAMILY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chair, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes the sad passing away of one of our members from  the  province,
       and that there are others in hospital; and


  (2) wishes them a speedy recovery and sends condolences to  the  bereaved
       family of the deceased.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon member, I will  deal  with  the  procedure,
then I shall ask if you could indicate who the deceased member is. Is  there
any objection to the motion?

Perhaps we should ask whether we can refer to the member in the motion.  Who
is the member who is deceased?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: The name has not yet been made public. It  is  still  being
withheld. They came from a festival and met with a gruesome accident.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any  objection  to  the  motion?  Yes,
there is an objection. Therefore the motion will become a notice of  motion.
It will not be proceeded with at this time.

 THE CONTRIBUTION OF NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO GOOD
  GOVERNANCE, THE IMPROVEMENT OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND THE MANAGEMENT
                              OF GLOBALISATION

                          (Subject for Discussion)

THE DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  thank
you very much for giving me an opportunity to participate in this  important
subject for discussion this afternoon. May I start  by  saying  that  around
the world new information  and  communication  technologies  -  ICTs  -  are
creating  or  supporting  innovative   systems   and   networks   that   are
increasingly affecting governments, societies, communities and individuals.

The importance of ICTs, the speed and volatility of change and the  lack  of
consensus on their impact lead to many debates,  such  as  the  one  we  are
engaged in today. It is vital that we recognise these new  technologies  and
the opportunities they create, as well  as  take  cognisance  of  the  exact
nature of the impact of ICTs on existing societies and governments.

The South African Government has acknowledged the potential contribution  of
ICTs to good  governance  and  has  embarked  on  promoting  an  information
society.  It  is  important  to  mention  that  the  main  purposes  of  the
Government  communicating  with  its  public  include  keeping  the   public
informed  about  Government  policies,  gleaning  citizens'  feedback  about
Government and complying with citizens' requests.

The new democratic Government has  initiated  processes  and  mechanisms  to
enhance public participation in Government processes.  It  has  focused  the
ability  of  new  information   technology   to   enhance   direct   citizen
participation in political processes. Since  pressure  and  interest  groups
require more information from Government to meet  their  strategic  planning
needs, our public sector has evolved with these changes  and  has  developed
an  adequate  information  system   that   communicates   sufficiently   and
timeously, and with reliable information.

The communication sector, therefore, has  shifted  its  position  to  become
more inclusive by focusing on improving the quality of  life  of  all  South
Africans and assisting in creating an information  society.  The  Government
therefore has used information technology to  re-engineer  and  support  all
Government  processes  in  order  to  meet  all  strategic  and  operational
requirements of the Public Service.

One of its prime goals was an e-schools  initiative,  with  the  purpose  of
ensuring that every African child  is  technologically  literate  within  10
years. In 1998 the Minister of Posts,  Telecommunications  and  Broadcasting
adopted  the  following  African   telecommunications   priority   projects:
telemedicine; telehealth; telecentres; tele-education;  African  centres  of
excellence; terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure  development;  the
development of and access to the Internet in Africa; and tele-agriculture.

Since 1994 the Government has focused on getting out technologies  to  areas
that have been denied service and development  opportunities  in  the  past.
Time  and  funding  have  also  been  allocated  to  provide  technology  to
telecentres  and  multipurpose  community  centres.  The  effect   is   that
information technology in itself is available to  communities  and  provides
opportunities to people.

Specific emphasis has thus been placed  on  enhancing  the  development  and
implementation of management information systems for Government. Our  public
institutions have  moved  away  from  a  perceived  disorganised  and  unco-
ordinated approach to information to a highly  co-ordinated  data-processing
approach. Due to the ever-changing nature of technology, ICTs have become  a
standing item on the agenda of Government in  order  to  keep  abreast  with
these evolving changes.

However,  the  fact  that  technology  is  evolving  rapidly  brings  unique
challenges and limitations to information systems. We  have  to  acknowledge
that South Africa is in a period of transition  in  which  new  technologies
are running  parallel  to  paper-based  policy-making  and  governance.  Our
Government,  therefore,  further  recognised  that  this   new   information
technology could be utilised to keep citizens and officials  in  touch  with
the ebb and flow of public values and judgments.

However, it also has the potential to advance some of  the  other  important
elements of democracy, namely accountability,  political  equality,  freedom
of speech and freedom of association. It is abundantly clear - and  we  just
have to look around us - that ICTs have proved  to  be  essential  tools  of
Government in the 21st century - a  modernised  electronic  Government  that
allows citizens broader and more timely access to information  and  services
through an  efficient  customer-  responsive  process,  thereby  creating  a
fundamental revision of the relationship  between  the  Government  and  the
public.

The debate on  modern  technologies  in  governance  is  incomplete  without
reference to the role of Government communications and  information  systems
in communications. It should be mentioned that GCIS's  key  objectives  are,
amongst other things, the following:  to  provide  media  and  communication
services to Government; to assist in developing Government media; to  ensure
efficient service to the media; and  to  produce  information  products  for
dissemination to the citizens.
Certainly, these objectives are central to the role of modern technology  in
good governance. Our Government will continue to be  an  intensive  user  of
ICTs, pursuing their  use  in  the  delivery  of  public  services  for  the
provision of  information  to  service  consumers,  for  acquiring  consumer
feedback about levels of satisfaction with services, and for  efficient  and
effective  production  of  public  services.  We  will  continue  with   the
aforementioned initiatives because they are aimed  at  improving  Government
communications and, in so doing, deepening good governance in South Africa.

When looking at  the  role  ICTs  have  played  in  improving  parliamentary
democracy, it is worth noting that  new  technologies  provide  a  means  of
enriching  democracy,  simplifying  voting  in   elections,   and   bringing
parliamentarians closer to their electorates. Traditionally, the sharing  of
information  relied  on  postal  and  faxing  facilities  which  were  time-
consuming and costly.

While members of the two Houses of Parliament  perform,  basically,  similar
functions in terms of the Constitution, the value of ICTs comes  into  sharp
focus in the NCOP as a uniquely  South  African  institution  that  involves
communications between South Africa's  nine  provinces,  delegates  and  the
electorate. This places an important obligation on the NCOP to  use  IT  and
ICTs as effectively as possible.

I am not too sure how  many  of  us  can  access  this  information  on  our
computers. We do have laptops and desktops, and we have a  cybercafe.  I  do
not know how much we use those, but they are very important  because  it  is
easy for us to communicate with our constituencies and with our  electorates
through sharing this IT information.

ICTs enable the NCOP to receive mandates from the  provinces  timeously.  In
the event of public hearings, direct communication between  the  legislative
powers and other role-players  is  established  instead  of  using  outdated
forms of communication.

The information age changed interaction  between  our  Parliament  generally
and the electorate. As a natural consequence, it  changed  the  organisation
of  Parliament  as  well  as  its  relationship  with  the  electorate   and
parliamentarians.

One of the key preconditions for any  successful  and  effective  democratic
system is participation by  the  citizens  in  the  process  of  legislation
through the debates in Parliament here. That  form  of  exchanging  messages
with the electorate is very important,  as  we  believe  that  our  citizens
should participate in whatever we are doing in our Parliament.

In South Africa, these challenges regarding the increasing use  of  ICTs  by
Parliament are particularly acute, because,  firstly,  under  apartheid  the
majority  of  South   African   citizens   were   actively   excluded   from
participation in the democratic process, and secondly,  the  current  levels
of ICT skills amongst South African  citizens  tend  to  be  both  weak  and
proportional to the levels of income and education.

Consequently, the use of ICTs in South Africa can be viewed  as  a  critical
agent for change  in  overcoming  the  information  gap  between  the  South
African  Parliament  and  the  majority  of  its  citizens.   However,   the
harnessing of ICTs to play such a role is dependent on  the  presence  of  a
highly literate and technologically informed population.

Thirdly, access to ICTs is virtually nonexistent for the majority  of  South
Africa's citizens. The  increased  use  of  ICTs  by  parliamentarians  thus
raises the question as to whether their use  will  facilitate  participatory
democracy.

I think these are the important issues that we should note  and  realise  as
members of Parliament, but the question regarding the  effective  management
and use of ICTs by the South African  Parliament  is  at  its  keenest  with
regard to utilising Internet facilities. From  an  economic,  administrative
and executive point of view, there is a clear rationale  for  Parliament  to
optimise its use of Internet  facilities.  This  will  facilitate  increased
access to, and  more  efficient  communication  with,  Government  agencies,
civic organisations and the public, both nationally and internationally.  It
brings the South African Parliament in line with current global trends  with
regard to information technology.

This indicates that the increased use of  ICTs  in  Parliament  may  further
Parliament's capacity to fulfil its functions. Parliamentary  dependence  on
the Internet thus has significant advantages for the  effective  running  of
the business of Parliament. The challenge for Parliament can be said to  lie
in how it  utilises  and  manages  these  technologies  in  support  of  its
democratic values and principles.

The issues I have just mentioned are not just peculiar and pertinent to  our
Parliament alone, but pertinent to parliaments across the globe. If  all  of
us as members of different parliaments  in  different  countries  could  use
this technology very efficiently, we could be in a position  to  communicate
with each other without running into problems.

In conclusion, I just  want  to  point  out  that  in  managing  ICTs  in  a
globalised world, it should be noted  that  modern  technologies  extend  to
virtually all fields of human endeavour, ranging from  agriculture,  energy,
fishing,   manufacturing   and   transport   to   education,   health    and
infrastructure provision. The application of such technologies is,  in  many
ways, perfectly in line with Nepad. I  wish  that  all  other  people  could
realise the importance of technology today. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chair, new information  and  communication  technologies
or ICTs can make a significant  contribution  to  the  achievement  of  good
governance goals.  E-governance  can  make  governance  more  efficient  and
effective, and bring many other benefits too, like  bringing  about  radical
economic and  social  changes  that  have  generated  new  geographics,  new
cultures and new markets. It also has the potential to play an  increasingly
important role in sociocultural, economic and political  development  in  an
era of globalisation.

The traditional means of communication, transparency and accountability,  no
matter how indispensable, are by nature insufficient and, as a  result,  the
ICTs are essential in achieving good governance. ICTs  can  be  very  useful
tools for deepening and renewing parliamentary democracy by allowing  better
participation by citizens and facilitating the sharing  of  knowledge  among
peoples.

Developing  countries'  governments  have  been  using  the  old  model   of
information technology or IT for 40 years. This only automated the  internal
workings of  government  by  processing  data.  The  new  model  is  one  of
information and communication technologies supporting and  transforming  the
external working of Government by processing and communicating data.

The old models held information technology isolated from the  mainstream  of
reform. The new model brings information systems to the heart of reform  and
can be seen as a key lever to change, as it is becoming  an  essential  part
of more and more governance initiatives. A  good  example  of  how  the  new
model of ICTs can support and improve the external working of governance  is
undoubtedly the initiative taken by the Department of  Health  in  the  Free
State to open up a hi-tech satellite training  centre  in  the  province  in
February 2002. Since then 30  sites  selected  for  a  pilot  phase  of  the
project have been equipped for broadcasting by the  national  Department  of
Health. The pilot sites consist of rural hospitals and  clinics  distributed
in seven of the provinces.

The pilot phase was started  in  July  2002  under  the  name  ``The  Health
Channel''.  The  pilot  was  a  huge  success  according  to  the   national
Department of Health, and the level  of  interest  raised  showed  that  the
project has great potential to cover  the  whole  of  South  Africa  and  be
amongst the Nepad initiatives for health.

In April 2003 the Department of Health and Sentech reached an agreement  for
outsourcing the management of the channel on  a  public-private  partnership
basis  to  a  consortium  with  the  necessary  expertise  in   broadcasting
management. According to the Department  of  Health,  the  channel  will  be
ready to broadcast to 1 800 public health  facilities  by  the  end  of  the
year.

This kind of information  and  communication  technology  is  an  innovative
approach for, and can be an effective way of, addressing the  immediate  and
future health education needs of the general public, and for developing  the
skills and knowledge  of  health  professionals  even  in  the  most  remote
hospitals and clinics in the country. This project also includes the  wonder
of telemedicine that can improve the health of thousands of our people.

As a permanent delegate of the Free  State  I  am  proud  to  say  that  the
Interactive  Learning  Communication  and  Management  project,   the   ICAM
project, was originally developed in the Free State. Another  success  story
is the free and fair election of 1999.  Through  large-scale  implementation
of unique information and communication technologies, the IEC  was  able  to
ensure that all South African citizens could have their voices heard.

Many other success stories all over  the  world  are  listed  in  a  working
document compiled by Richard Heeks of the University of  Manchester  in  the
UK. Heeks, however,  also  indicated  in  the  same  document  that  success
stories in developing countries are  the  exception  rather  than  the  rule
mainly because of a lack of e-readiness, and also owing  to  the  fact  that
surveys of e- governance  initiatives  are  incredibly  rare.  According  to
Heeks, these are shortcomings that need to be addressed.

Since 1994 the South African Parliament has introduced a number of  measures
to improve the application of ICTs in the activities of Parliament  and  the
legislatures. These measures include, as we have  heard,  the  provision  of
laptop computers to all MPs and continual computer training for which we  as
MPs are very grateful.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the crux of modern technology  -  IT
and ICTs - is that it enables governments to know what they know, to  manage
their knowledge and to apply technology in order to increase efficiency  and
accuracy in the performance of their daily  tasks.  IT  and  ICTs,  however,
only serve as a tool to achieve all this. Good governance still requires  an
ethic for the management of the state and its resources based on  principles
and   certain   norms,   including   the   requirements   of   transparency,
accountability, respect for the rule of law and  an  independent  judiciary,
and a democratic state that protects public liberties. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the rapid growth in trade and capital  flows,
the end of the Cold War and the expansion of information  have  changed  the
world as dramatically as the Industrial Revolution  once  did.  Connectivity
has increased, both economically and intellectually. This has given  us  new
opportunities, but it has also increased our responsibilities.

A shared social space is emerging. Some call it  a  global  village,  but  I
prefer to use the image of a global neighbourhood as an  expression  for  an
increased  interdependence  and  an  emerging  common  ground   of   values.
Decisions and developments in one region may today have immediate  and  far-
reaching consequences for the lives of individuals,  communities  and  whole
countries in other parts of the world. Globalisation makes information  more
accessible  everywhere.  Information  and  communication  technologies   are
connecting people in a way that we could only dream of a  decade  ago.  Even
very poor parts of the world can access information via  the  Internet,  for
example in Internet cafés.

The exposure to  other  lifestyles  and  values  will  influence  and  shape
demands for change. Authoritarian regimes that used to  control  information
as one means of securing power can no longer do so, even  if  some  of  them
still make futile efforts to do so.

Access to and knowledge about democracy and human  rights  are  enhanced  by
the new information technology, and so  with  the  demand  for  change.  The
clash between growing prosperity and increasing injustices is becoming  ever
clearer, and more and more people  are  reacting  to  realities  which  they
perceive to be deeply unfair and unjust. We see many signs of  an  increased
engagement for justice. We must protect democratic values. We must  be  able
to guarantee citizens' influence.

We are gathered at a time when  there  is  a  political  commitment  at  the
highest level to reduce poverty. The Millennium Summit demonstrated  further
political will and commitment. The  central  challenge  is  to  ensure  that
globalisation becomes a positive force  for  all  the  world's  people.  The
concrete commitment is to reduce by half the population  living  in  extreme
poverty by 2015.

Globalisation is a powerful force,  born  out  of  the  interaction  between
people. It can be shaped and managed to respond to  the  world's  developing
needs.  If  we  have  the  political  will,  we  can  make  globalisation  a
constructive tool in building a better world for all. Today we  possess  the
knowledge and resources to  eradicate  poverty.  Globalisation  has  brought
development prospects of unprecedented magnitude. In the  past  decades,  we
have seen amazing progress, both in the fields  of  science  and  technology
and in the social and economic  spheres.  Living  conditions  have  improved
considerably for many people in the world.

We also see a stable trend towards democracy and  economic  growth  in  many
developing  countries.  This  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  reach   the
international development goals. We  can  also  help  make  it  possible  by
supporting poor countries in their efforts. The contribution thus  far  made
by new information  and  communication  technologies  has  facilitated  work
processes tremendously.
The IFP admires the new information  and  communication  technologies  as  a
means of improving parliamentary democracy and management of  globalisation.


Mrs B N SONO: Madam Chair, we live in a new world order  of  the  globalised
world  with  its  own  defining  technologies:  computers,   the   Internet,
satellite communications, fibre optics, etc.  The  defining  measurement  of
the globalised system is speed - speed of commerce, speed of  communication,
speed of travel and speed of  innovation.  It  is  worth  noting  that  this
Government has adapted well, and its commitment to ICT is highly rewarding.

One of the undeniable consequences of the new information and  communication
technologies is that they have changed forever the relationship between  the
individual and the state. Because  globalisation  has  simultaneously  wired
the world into LANs and WANs and other networks, it has given more power  to
individuals to influence markets and nation states than at  any  other  time
in history.

Applied with equity, globalisation can be  a  force  for  good,  opening  up
avenues for economic growth. For example,  with  the  outbreak  of  Sars  in
Asia, it was rapid worldwide  communication  of  the  dangers  that  allowed
measures such as  travel  warnings,  medical  screening  and  quarantine  to
contribute to effective control of the disease.

Bringing the importance of  communication  closer  to  home,  we  have  just
received a communication from the  Secretary  to  Parliament  regarding  the
annual  price  increase  of  food  -  not  that  it  is  very  welcome,  but
computerisation makes good governance in the sense that, at least, there  is
control and there are control measures against wastage, although  the  price
of food has gone up considerably.

In the area of bandwidth, with the new telecommunications  offerings,  there
has been, after an arduous process, the  appointment  of  a  second  network
operator alongside Telkom, which is due to be ratified by the Department  of
Communications, albeit 18 months late. This process has  fallen  far  behind
schedule and invariably it is the consumer who bears  the  brunt.  The  good
outcomes are the estimated benefits to the economy of  between  R75  billion
and R90 billion over 10 years. This will be achieved  by  reducing  tariffs,
driving down the cost of communications to stimulate  the  economy,  leading
to the creation of new industries and ultimately forcing  Telkom  to  follow
suit - another plus for good governance, albeit achieved at a price  to  the
consumer.

We need to give  credit  where  credit  is  due.  Initiatives  for  improved
parliamentary communication with  the  average  South  African  citizen  are
indeed good and welcome.  This  Government  has  ensured  that  people  from
Khayelitsha in Cape Town and from Soweto in Gauteng have a glimpse  of  what
their public representatives are doing, whether on radio  or  on  television
through the Parliamentary Channel.

The  contribution  of  new  communications   technologies   can   never   be
overemphasised. According to a recent  survey  by  BMI  TechKnowledge  2002,
fewer than 5% of South Africans have access to the Internet. Another  survey
found  that  approximately  35%  of  all  South  Africans  have  access   to
telephones, whether through cellular networks  or  landlines.  Therefore  if
South Africa is to reap major benefits from  information  and  communication
technologies, an aggressive  strategy  to  achieve  Internet  and  telephony
penetration has to be stepped up. Targets towards  this  achievement  should
be set at a premium.

Admittedly the  phenomenal  growth  of  mobile  communications  and  of  the
Internet and  the  convergence  of  the  telecommunications,  computing  and
broadcasting sectors have brought a sea change in the regulatory  frameworks
of this Government. Issues of governance play themselves out in public,  for
example the exposure of corruption scandals and  inefficiencies  where  they
exist.

We are all starting to realise how globalisation has a strong  influence  on
the internal development of South Africa, regions and  communities  as  well
as on the institutions governing  them.  This  powerful  transformation  has
increasingly visible effects on the population and, as a  result,  on  their
political representation.

The new economic reality that is taking  shape  sets  major  challenges  for
parliamentarians,  particularly  concerning  the  effectiveness   of   their
legislative actions and their ability to adapt to change.  Indeed,  to  what
extent can a parliament, as the  central  institution  of  democratic  life,
maintain its influence  in  a  society  that  is  increasingly  affected  by
economic agents, international trends and intergovernmental plans of  action
when its laws are in force only in a limited territory?
Globalisation can be beneficial, as it  provides  a  way  to  break  out  of
isolation. However, it also  generates  inequalities.  One  of  the  serious
impacts that this may cause is the complete disappearance of  certain  local
economies that are of major importance to  subregions,  such  as  small  and
medium businesses - especially, for example, in the  agricultural  sector  -
which cannot compete with multinationals once markets are opened.

Since economics affects all aspects of life in  any  country,  co-ordination
among parliaments, government departments, civil  society  and  business  is
crucial in obtaining a sustainable and balanced modernisation programme  for
the country. Bringing this closer to home, this Council has  taken  note  of
the collapse of the WTO trade round and the  major  concerns  of  developing
countries, including ours, around the agricultural subsidies  which  deprive
developing countries of their competitive advantage.  Parliamentarians  have
a crucial role to  play  in  order  to  minimise  the  negative  impacts  of
economic integration processes.

Initiatives supporting the improvement of parliamentary democracy to  manage
globalisation by ensuring that the interests of the  population  are  served
would be the following: the establishment of some form of  participation  by
all concerned  parties  in  the  negotiation  process;  the  setting  up  of
mechanisms to make the necessary expertise and information available to  the
different sectors interested in this process - for example, considering  the
conflicting media reports regarding the collapse of the WTO trade  talks  at
Cancun, I am sure that this Council would want to  be  briefed  as  to  what
exactly happened in  Mexico;  the  dissemination  of  information  regarding
choices made and  progress  achieved;  and  the  conducting  of  studies  to
analyse the numerous aspects arising  out  of  the  hemispheric  integration
processes.

Parliamentarians, as  representatives  of  populations,  must  take  up  the
challenge of contributing to the establishment of fair and  more  democratic
trade agreements. Parliamentary groups can  play  a  pivotal  role  in  this
regard,  especially  when  it  relates  to  contributions  in  research  and
development. As we have seen again with the ACP-EU  parliamentary  meetings,
at the end of the day, it is always the African countries  -  including  our
country, because it is one of the developing states - that lose out.

My contribution in particular would be that as  a  parliament,  much  as  we
recognise the efforts that the Government has made and the distance  it  has
travelled in connecting the country ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Madam Chairperson, we have, in recent  years,  picked  up  a
whole new language in South Africa, namely a new computer language, which  I
am sure is the same elsewhere in the world as  well.  There  are  now  terms
such as ``global village'', the ``Internet super  highway'',  ``surfing  the
net'', ``e-mail'',  ``chat  rooms'',  ``home  pages'',  ``websites'',  ``web
addresses'', ``search engines'' and the like. Whether  we  fully  comprehend
what is happening around us or not,  the  reality  is  that  there  are  new
dynamic,  emerging  communication  tools  increasingly  available  to  South
Africans across the racial divide.

Increasingly our homes, schools and even churches are becoming aware of  the
new information technology available to them. How many  South  Africans  are
walking around with cellphones?

Ungakhe uve phaya eMpuma Koloni, phaya  koomaPort  St  Johns  umntu  esithi,
`Molo mhlobo wam!'[You can hear people even in areas such as Port  St  Johns
in the Eastern Cape saying: `Hello, my friend!']

If we began to tabulate these new technological innovations, then  we  would
no doubt come up with impressive numbers of ordinary  people  having  access
to highly sophisticated  communication  tools.  With  this  awareness  comes
increasing demands for computer hardware, telephone lines, electrical  power
sources,  cellphone  towers  and  other  start-up  infrastructure  which  is
essential to set up communication networks of this nature.

Kambe kunjalo iingxaki zikhona kuba  ungafumanisa  ukuba  kwezinye  zeendawo
zithi zikhona ufumanise ukuba azikwazi ukusebenza ngenxa  yeendawo  ezibekwe
kuzo. [But there are problems still being  encountered  in  other  areas  as
they cannot function because of non-availability  of  infrastructure  and/or
their location.]

What we have attempted to do, since we  came  into  power  in  1994,  is  to
utilise  whatever  resources  we  have  at  our  disposal  to  ensure   good
governance and the efficient delivery of services. We believe  that  central
to good governance  are  accountability,  effective  and  efficient  service
delivery and exceptional communication strategies, especially for those  who
have been disadvantaged.

Abantu bafuna ukusoloko befumana  ingxelo  kwabo  babanyulileyo.  Bafuna  lo
Rhulumente wabo aphucule  ngakumbi  iinkonzo  eziza  kubo  ngoqhagamshelwano
nonxibelelwano  olululo  noluphucukileyo.  Ngolo   hlobo   abameli   babantu
banganakho ukuba nonxibelelwano  oluthe  ngqo  nangokulindelekileyo  nabantu
babo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[People want to constantly hear reports about what is happening  from  their
representatives. They want this Government to improve services by  providing
efficient communication strategies. This would provide direct  communication
between people and their representatives.]

Given  this  new  era  of  globalisation,  with  the  use  of  sophisticated
information systems and other  technological  innovations,  governments  can
also  promote  good  governance  by  bringing  government  to  the   people,
government to  business  and  government  departments  to  other  government
departments.  Essentially  what  this  means  is  that   Government   should
creatively take advantage of new technologies for service delivery.

In the e-Government Policy of the  Department  of  the  Public  Service  and
Administration, the second  draft,  version  3.2,  there  are  a  number  of
groundbreaking strategies already under discussion. As part of their  vision
they quote from  the  Gartner  Group,  which  defines  e-government  as  the
``continuous  optimisation  of  government  service  delivery,  constituency
participation  and  governance  by  transforming   internal   and   external
relationships through technology, the Internet and new media''.

Some of the methods governments can utilise in  the  efficient  delivery  of
services, which are also contained  in  the  e-governance  policy  document,
are: walk-in centres, where a wide range of integrated public  services  can
be offered by one agent; Internet facilities which offer practicable  public
services privately, confidentially and instantly;  and  call  centres  which
allow for the provision of integrated public services remotely,  by  way  of
the telephone.

Eneneni   zikhona   iingxaki   nemingeni   ekusetyenzisweni   kobuxhakaxhaka
boqhagamshelwano  nokuxhamla  iinkonzo  zoluntu.  Eyona  ingundoqo   ekubeni
yingxaki ngumbane. Ngelishwa yonke imizamo emitsha ingakumbi  ukusetyenziswa
kweekhompyutha  ifuna  umbane  ukuze   isebenze.   Ikhona   injalo   imizamo
esiyiqhwabela  izandla  iindawo   kuRhulumente   wethu   ziseninzi   iindawo
ezingenawo lo  mbane  usisitshixo  okanye  iindleko  zokuwufumana  ziphezulu
kakhulu. Nditsho  ke  phaya  ezilalini  phaqa.  Kananjalo  obu  buchwepheshe
boqhagamshelwano, lungagadwanga, lungenza umsantsa  omkhulu  phakathi  kwabo
banezinto  nabo  bahluphekileyo.  Ibalulekile  ke   into   yokuba   lugadwe.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[There are problems and challenges in the use of conventional  communication
strategies and access to public services. One of the most pressing  problems
is electricity. Unfortunately all innovations, such  as  computers,  require
it. Our Government has made considerable efforts to provide electricity  but
there are areas where it is still unavailable or the  cost  of  installation
is very high. I am talking  about  the  very  remote  areas.  We  should  be
cautious of the fact  that  these  new  information  technology  initiatives
could create a wide divide between the  haves  and  the  have-nots,  if  not
carefully monitored. It is therefore important that they are monitored.]

Alternative power sources - installations such as solar power and  batteries
- are possible, but the equipment used  for  information  and  communication
technology is not necessarily compatible. Clearly we need to  do  more  work
in the development of information technology equipment that can be  utilised
in any  of  our  vast  geographical  areas  before  we  can  implement  such
initiatives.

Then there is the question of affordability. Those who may  wish  to  access
government services such as social grants will be automatically excluded  by
virtue of their poverty. Access to Government through the Internet  costs  a
great deal of money. Even  if  Government  were  to  purchase  some  of  the
equipment, because we do not manufacture all the IT and other  communication
equipment in South Africa, we would have  to  pay  exorbitant  international
prices.

We in South Africa are extremely aware that three quarters  of  the  world's
telephones are installed in only eight industrialised countries,  while  80%
of the world's people, mostly in developing countries,  have  no  access  to
telephone services. Here on our own continent we have  12%  of  the  world's
people, yet only 1,8% of the world's lines.

With these inequities happening on a global scale, we already have the  odds
stacked against us in our task  of  levelling  the  playing  fields  in  our
country. However, we have never backed away from a challenge. It is  not  in
our nature. We therefore have no hesitation  whatsoever  in  supporting  all
calls,  whether  national  or  international,  which  encourage  a   climate
conducive to the advent of a truly information-driven society.

Ndiyabonga, Mhlalingaphambili. [Kwaqhwatywa.]  [I  thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

National Council of Provinces:

Papers:

1.    The Chairperson:


     (1)    Eighth Report of the Working Group on the African Union:


         1. Introduction


              In its seventh report to the House, adopted on 19 June  2003,
              the Working  Group  recommended  that  the  National  Assembly
              consider  convening  a  meeting  of  African  Parliaments   to
              exchange views on the Pan African Parliament (PAP) with a view
              to building a common vision.


              The Speaker had consulted the  Chairperson  of  the  National
              Council of Provinces (NCOP) and been  advised  that  the  NCOP
              Working Group on the African Union would be  meeting  and  the
              Deputy Chairperson would be participating in  the  discussions
              of the National Assembly  Working  Group.  The  Working  Group
              agreed that it would continue to invite  all  members  of  the
              NCOP Working Group to its meetings.


         2. Meeting of African Parliaments


              The meeting of African Parliaments was held from 30 June to 1
              July 2003 in the National Assembly Chamber and was  opened  by
              Deputy President, H.E. Mr J G Zuma.


              The meeting was attended  by  138  Parliamentarians  from  38
              Member States of the African Union. Twenty six (68%) of the 38
              delegations included women Parliamentarians,  with  the  total
              number of women Parliamentarians  being  41  (30%).  Delegates
              included 34 Presiding Officers of which 17  were  Speakers  of
              Parliaments.


              The meeting adopted a Declaration which was presented to  the
              Assembly of the African Union at the 2nd Summit of the AU held
              from 4 to 12 July 2003 in Maputo, Mozambique. The Declaration,
              among other things, urged  Member  States  that  had  not  yet
              deposited the instrument of ratification (of the PAP Protocol)
              to do so by 31 December 2003. The full report of  the  meeting
              as  well  as  the  Declaration  can   be   accessed   on   the
              Parliamentary website: www.parliament.gov.za.


         3. Establishment of the Pan African Parliament


              In terms  of  Article  22  of  the  Protocol  to  the  Treaty
              Establishing the African Economic Community  relating  to  the
              Pan African Parliament (PAP Protocol), the Protocol will enter
              into  force  thirty  (30)  days  after  the  deposit  of   the
              instruments of ratification by a simple majority of the Member
              States. Article 5(2) provides that the Assembly will determine
              the beginning of the first term of office of the  PAP  at  its
              session immediately following the entry  into  force  of  this
              Protocol.


              At the time of the 2nd Summit of the African  union  only  16
              countries  had  ratified  the  Protocol.  The   Summit   could
              therefore not decide a date for the first meeting of the  PAP.
              It mandated the Chairperson of the Union, in consultation with
              the Commission, to determine the beginning of the  first  term
              of office of the Parliament in terms of Article 5(2)  as  soon
              as it comes into force.


              The Summit did not discuss or decide on the Seat of the  PAP.
              However, if sufficient ratifications are deposited before  the
              next Summit, it will be possible for the  Chairperson  of  the
              African Union to determine that the PAP meet  in  any  country
              offering to host that meeting.


              The Assembly endorsed  the  Declaration  emanating  from  the
              meeting of African Parliaments and also  urged  all  countries
              which had not already deposited instruments of ratification to
              speed up the process of signing and ratifying the Protocol  by
              31 December 2003, to enable the Protocol to enter  into  force
              and the Parliament to meet before 31 January 2004.


              The full text of the Assembly resolution is attached  to  the
              report as annexure A.


         (2)     Ratifications and preparations for PAP


              As  at  8  September  2003,  22   countries   had   deposited
              instruments  of  ratification  with  the  AU   Commission.   A
              mechanism has been  established  at  an  administrative  level
              between the South African Parliament and the AU Commission  to
              track progress on ratification.


              The Speaker informed the  Working  Group,  that  the  African
              Union Steering Committee on PAP, would be convened soon  after
              the new Commission  elected  in  Maputo  took  office  in  mid
              September.  The  Committee  would  consider  the  progress  of
              ratification, and assess the possibility of the PAP having its
              inaugural  session  before  31  January  2004,  as   per   the
              resolution of the Summit.


              The Steering Committee will also  consider  the  preparations
              that would need to be made, in order  to  enable  the  PAP  to
              meet.


         (3)     Deliberations of the Working Group


              In view of the possibility of a meeting of the PAP  early  in
              2004, the Working Group agreed to focus on preparing the South
              African Parliament to participate. Among the issues identified
              are:  composition  of  delegation  to  the  PAP;  election  of
              delegates; mandates, accountability and reporting  mechanisms;
              Oath of Office; a  seminar  on  the  Protocol  and  the  South
              African Constitution as well as the popularization of the  PAP
              and the AU. A programme of work has  been  agreed  to  address
              these issues.
                  (a)   Composition  of  delegation  to  the   Pan   African
                       Parliament


                  In terms of Article  4(2)  of  the  Protocol,  each  State
                  shall be represented in the PAP by five (5)  members,  at
                  least one of whom must be a woman. The representation  of
                  each Member State is, in terms of Article 4(3),  required
                  to reflect the diversity of political  opinions  in  each
                  National Parliament or other deliberative organ.


                  (i)  Gender
                         The Working Group recommends: That at least  three
                         (3) of the delegates should be women.


                  (ii) Political representation
                         Parties  need  to  discuss  and   agree   on   the
                         composition of the delegation in  terms  of  party
                         representation.   The   following   options   were
                         discussed by the Working Group and parties need to
                         reflect on them, prior to a decision.
                         Option A
                         If the largest party is  to  have  a  majority:  3
                         members from the largest party and 2 members  from
                         among other parties.


                         Option B
                         If  no  majority  representation   is   considered
                         necessary:  the  five  parties  with  the  biggest
                         numbers could have 1 member each or a variation.


                  (iii)      Representation from each House
                         The above matter is still under discussion and the
                         Working Group will report on it in due course.


                  (iv) Executive representation
                         Article 7 of the Protocol states  that  membership
                         of  the  PAP  will  not  be  compatible  with  the
                         exercise of executive or judicial functions  in  a
                         Member State. It is an established practice within
                         Parliament that members of the Executive  are  not
                         included  in  the  composition  of   Parliamentary
                         delegations.  Members  of   the   Executive   will
                         therefore not be included in the delegation to the
                         PAP.


                  (b)  Election of delegates
                       According  to   Article   5(1),   the   Pan   African
                       Parliamentarians shall be elected  or  designated  by
                       the respective  National  Parliaments  or  any  other
                       deliberative organs of the Member States, from  among
                       their members. Article 5(3) provides that the term of
                       a member of the PAP shall run concurrently  with  his
                       or her term  in  the  National  Parliament  or  other
                       deliberative organ.


                       This means that this Parliament will  need  to  elect
                       members to serve on the PAP, if  the  Chairperson  of
                       the AU acts in terms of  the  Summit  resolution  and
                       determines the beginning of the first term of the PAP
                       to be before South African  elections  in  2004.  The
                       post-elections Parliament will need to elect five (5)
                       members of the PAP to serve until the 2009 elections.




                       The  Working  Group  is  currently   discussing   the
                       procedure to be followed in the election of delegates
                       to the PAP. Recommendations in this  regard  will  be
                       tabled in due course.


                  (c)  Mandates, accountability and reporting mechanisms
                       The  Working  Group  notes  that  Article  6  of  the
                       Protocol states that the Pan African Parliamentarians
                       shall  vote  in  their   personal   and   independent
                       capacity. However, it was also noted  that  delegates
                       to the PAP represent their respective Parliaments and
                       for this reason they should be  accountable  for  the
                       positions they take at the PAP.


                       (i)   Establishment of a Committee
                            The Working Group recommends:  That  Parliament
                            considers establishing a Committee  to  process
                            and deal with issues emanating from the African
                            Union  and  the  Southern  African  Development
                            Community Parliamentary  forum  (SADC-PF).  The
                            Committee would discuss  mandates  and  receive
                            reports emanating from the  PAP  and  the  SADC
                            Parliament (when it is established)  and  table
                            reports in the South African  Parliament.  This
                            Committee could also be a forum for  discussion
                            with the Executive in its engagement with  both
                            the AU and SADC.


                            It  will  be  necessary   to   establish   this
                            Committee before the first meeting of the  PAP,
                            which  may  be  as  early  as   January   2004.
                            Comparative research will be conducted  on  how
                            other national Parliaments interact with  their
                            delegates   to   regional    and    continental
                            Parliamentary bodies.


                       (ii)  Recall of delegates
                            Article 5(4)(f) of the Protocol  provides  that
                            the seat of a member of the  PAP  shall  become
                            vacant if he or she is recalled by the National
                            Parliament or other deliberative organ.


                            The Working Group recommends: That the Assembly
                            considers the  inclusion  in  the  Rules  of  a
                            procedure for recall.


                  (d)  Oath of Office
                       In terms of Article 13 of the Protocol, at its  first
                       sitting after the election and before proceeding with
                       any other matter, Pan African Parliamentarians  shall
                       take an Oath or make a solemn declaration.


                       The  Working  Group  has  considered  whether   South
                       African delegates to the PAP should  be  required  to
                       take an additional oath in  Parliament.  The  general
                       view was that this would not be  necessary,  however,
                       the possibility  of  amending  the  current  oath  to
                       provide for affirmation of loyalty to the concept  of
                       African Unity could be explored. The  Assembly  could
                       consider  this  matter  with  a  view  to  the   2004
                       elections.


                  (e)  Seminar on the PAP Protocol  and  the  South  African
                       Constitution
                       This will be the first occasion that Parliament  will
                       participate in a forum such as  the  PAP  and  it  is
                       necessary that all members are informed and  prepared
                       for the additional responsibilities we are  assuming.
                       The Working Group has agreed that it is necessary  to
                       make members aware of the detail contained in the PAP
                       Protocol and the implications of participation  in  a
                       multilateral Parliament and the  possible  impact  on
                       the functioning of our Parliament. In this regard, it
                       is also necessary to  include  a  discussion  on  the
                       South  African   Constitution   vis-à-vis   the   PAP
                       Protocol.


                       The Working Group recommends: That a seminar  on  the
                       above issues be held  before  the  end  of  the  2003
                       Parliamentary session. This exercise will  create  an
                       opportunity for members to meaningfully engage on PAP
                       issues.


              Report to be considered.




         ANNEXURE A to Eighth Report of the Working  Group  on  the  African
         Union:


         DECISION ON THE PROTOCOL TO THE  TREATY  ESTABLISHING  THE  AFRICAN
         ECONOMIC COMMUNITY RELATING TO THE PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

(1)   The Assembly:


      1.    NOTES WITH  APPRECIATION  the  conclusions  of  the  meeting  of
          African Parliaments held in Cape Town, South Africa from  30  June
          to 1 July 2003 and ENCOURAGES the Steering  Committee  set  up  in
          pursuance of the Decision taken by the Assembly in  Durban,  South
          Africa in July 2002, to pursue its endeavours aimed at speeding up
          the process of ratification of the Protocol by Member States;


      2.    UNDERSCORES the urgency of the entry into force of the  Protocol
          to the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community relating
          to the Pan-African Parliament and the  importance  of  setting  up
          this organ which will ensure the effective and full  participation
          of African peoples in  the  development  and  integration  of  the
          Continent;


      3.     COMMENDS  Member  States  which  have  already  deposited   the
          instruments of ratification of the Protocol;


      4.    URGES all countries which have not already done so, to speed  up
          the process of signing and ratifying the Protocol by  31  December
          2003 if possible to enable the Protocol to enter into  force,  and
          the Parliament to meet before January 31st 2004;


      5.    REQUESTS the Commission to pursue the efforts already  initiated
          to obtain very rapidly the requisite number of  ratifications  for
          the  entry  into  force  of  the  Protocol,  thereby  making  this
          instrument operational;


      6.    NOTES that the Protocol will come into force 30 days  after  the
          deposit of the instruments of ratification by a simple majority of
          the Member States;


      7.    MANDATES the Chairperson of the Union, in consultation with  the
          Commission, to determine the beginning of the first term of office
          of the Pan-African Parliament in terms  of  Article  5(2)  of  the
          Protocol as soon as the Protocol comes into force.


(2)   Executive Summary of Issues  raised  at  the  Workshop  on  the  Draft
      Powers,  Privileges  and  Immunities  of  Parliament  and   Provincial
      Legislatures Bill


      (1)   General:


           The workshop recommended that consideration be given to  whether
           the Provinces should not consider a  separate  Bill  within  the
           same broad-based guidelines or whether there should be one  bill
           with a separate chapter specifically dealing with the Provinces.


           Following discussion it was agreed that  given  sections  58(2),
           71(2) and 117(2) of the  Constitution,  the  recommendation  was
           that there  should  be  a  single  piece  of  legislation  which
           included  a  separate  chapter  specifically  dealing  with  the
           Provinces.


      (2)   Definitions:


           The definitions in the Bill  need  to  be  consistent  with  the
           provisions of the Constitution and be aligned with the Rules  of
           the Houses and other relevant legislation.


      (3)   Chapter 2:


           (3.1)  Clarification  would  be  needed  (even  in  the   Rules)
                    regarding the process of the exercise  of  control  over
                    the  security  forces  in  Parliament  for  purposes  of
                    safeguarding the precincts and  enforcing  parliamentary
                    law.


      (4)   Chapter 3:


           (4.1) A clear definition  is  needed  of  the  terms  which  are
                    material to the content of the Chapter, e.g. "punishable
                    conduct" contempt.


           (4.2) Fines which are to be imposed need to be  reconciled  with
                    other  analogous  legislation  and  with  the  penalties
                    provided for in the Code of Ethics.


      (5)   Chapter 4:


           (5.1) It is recommended  that  the  clauses  providing  for  the
                    immunities for Members of the Pan-African Parliament and
                    the SADC Parliament should be deleted and dealt with  in
                    the relevant protocols or treaties.  Care  needs  to  be
                    taken to ensure that the immunities which are granted do
                    not conflict with  the  any  of  the  rights  which  are
                    entrenched in the Constitution.


           (5.2)  The  Bill  should  protect   non-members.   Parliamentary
                    privilege  is  a  powerful  tool  and  should  be   used
                    responsibly by those who are granted it.  The  Rules  of
                    the House should make provision for specific  guidelines
                    to empower the Presiding Officer to act on any abuse  of
                    privilege or defamation  of  another  Member.  Should  a
                    person feel aggrieved they should be  able  to  petition
                    the Presiding Officer to  protect  their  reputation.  A
                    mechanism for considering these petitions would need  to
                    be set up.


      (6)   Chapter 5:


           The clause in the Bill which seeks to force a witness to provide
           information that may incriminate him/her in a legal suit  should
           take account of the constitutional right to silence,  so  as  to
           ensure that the Bill does not breach any constitutional rights.


      (7)   Chapter 6:


           This Chapter is concerned with the publication and  broadcasting
           of proceedings. The broadcasting policy which is currently being
           drafted and the relevant provisions of this  Chapter  should  be
           read together and balanced  against  the  voters'  right  to  be
           informed   regarding   the   performance   of    their    public
           representatives. The provisions should also  be  scrutinised  in
           terms of the practicality of implementation.


      (8)   Chapter 7:


           Clause 29 provides for the repeal of section 31  of  the  Powers
           and Privileges of Parliament  Act,  91  of  1963.  This  section
           defined who the Accounting Officer of Parliament  is,  but  this
           provision has not been imported into the  current  Bill.  It  is
           recommended that section 31 of the 1963 Act be  incorporated  in
           the Bill.


      (9)   Tagging of the Bill:


           The Bill has been provisionally classified as a section 75 Bill.
           However, given that  the  Bill  will  also  regulate  provincial
           Legislatures, the question arises as to whether the Bill  should
           be tagged as a section 75 Bill or a section 76 Bill.
