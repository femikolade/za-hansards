                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr N M RAJU: Madam Chair, at the next sitting of the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  as a  result  of  the  Constitution  of  South  Africa's  fourth
           amending Act, ie the floor-crossing legislation, there has  been
           a flurry of activity on the floors of the National Assembly  and
           in provincial legislatures;


       (b)  one of the main  victims  of  the  "coalition  forces",  to  use
           current military parlance, is the almost total decimation of the
           New NP, which lies comatose in the ICU ward  of  politics  as  a
           prelude to its demise;


  (2) wishes to record this historic occasion in South African politics  so
       that we can finally lay to rest the unlamented legacy of apartheid as
       fashioned and championed by the former National Party, parent of  the
       New NP; and


  (3) notes that the DA wishes to welcome the former members of the New  NP
       who have finally jettisoned the baggage of the  past  and  joined  an
       inclusive, progressive and modern DA.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting
of this House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with concern the crippling effect the arms  purchasing  deal  is
           having upon the capability of the SA National Defence  Force  as
           half of its budget is being consumed by funding arms  purchases,
           leaving it incapable of being able to  effectively  sustain  its
           operational requirements, including  our  peacekeeping  role  in
           Africa;


       (b)  that according to the Mail & Guardian of 20 March  2003  -  with
           reference to a quote from the  Director  of  the  Institute  for
           Security Studies - "There is a  structural  crisis  building  up
           which at some point is going to blow up in our faces"; and


       (c)  that what this means, in essence, is that  training  of  Defence
           Force personnel will  suffer,  there  is  a  shortage  of  basic
           equipment such as clothing and  troop  carriers,  there  are  no
           financial resources to retrench or replace personnel, and  there
           is no money to pay for operations; and


  (2) calls on the Government to -


       (a)  institute an urgent investigation into the  direct  implications
           of the arms deal on the capabilities  and  strength  of  the  SA
           National Defence Force;


       (b)  scrap or downsize the arms deal with immediate effect; and


       (c)  invest in our Defence Force as a vital element that is  required
           to protect our country and our democratic society in Africa  and
           in a dangerous world.

                       FATAL ROAD ACCIDENT STATISTICS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that, according to a written reply from  the  Minister  of
       Transport to a question by Mr P A Matthee -


       (a)  the comprehensive statistics in respect of fatal road  accidents
           for 2002 will only be available towards the middle of 2003;


       (b)  due to the high number of accidents in  other  accident  groups,
           information  is  collected  only  for  fatal  accidents  and  no
           information is currently available  on  the  number  of  serious
           injury accidents and the  number  of  persons  injured  in  such
           accidents;


       (c)  the Arrive Alive  National  Fatal  Accident  Information  Centre
           (NFAIC) at the  Department  of  Transport  continuously  obtains
           information  on  fatal  accidents  only  directly  from   police
           stations country-wide, which information is provided daily on  a
           voluntary basis - not all information is submitted  as  required
           and additional information on fatal accidents is  obtained  from
           the  CAS  system  of  the  SAPS,  which   information   is   not
           comprehensive  in  that  no  information  is  provided  on,  for
           example,  the  number  of  fatalities,  vehicles   involved   or
           contributory factors;


       (d)  the total number of fatal accidents for 2002 is 9818;


       (e)  the total number of fatalities in  respect  of  the  6329  fatal
           accidents reported to the NFAIC is 7897, but that the number  of
           fatalities in respect of the 3489 fatal accidents obtained  from
           the CAS system of the SAPS is not known; and

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon member, your time for  tabling  this
motion has expired. Given that it is a motion that you wish to move  without
notice, I will allow you to come to the nub of the motion  so  that  we  may
deal with voting on it.

Mr P A MATTHEE:


       (f)  the estimated all-inclusive cost of only fatal accidents to  the
           South African economy, is R4Â 318 billion; and


  (2) urges the Minister of Transport and the Government to  take  whatever
       steps may be necessary to reduce the number of serious road accidents
       in South Africa maximally.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            STINGING JOINT OPERATION BY ANTI-CORRUPTION TASK TEAM

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and commends once more another stinging joint operation by  the
       Anti-Corruption  Task  Team  made  up  of  representatives   of   the
       Scorpions, the SAPS, the  National  Prosecuting  Authority's  Special
       Investigative Unit and other law-enforcement agencies in the  Eastern
       Cape in which at least 25 people were arrested because of  corruption
       by government employees;


  (2) further notes that this joint operation returned to the Eastern  Cape
       Government approximately R3 million  which  had  illegitimately  been
       paid by government employees to suppliers;


  (3) further notes  that  this  operation  brings  the  number  of  people
       arrested to 75 in total; and


  (4) believes that this is in line with the ANC Government's commitment to
       root out corruption wherever it occurs.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             CONDEMNATION OF AMERICAN AND BRITISH ATTACK ON IRAQ

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T B TAABE: Chair, I move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the fact that the American and British forces have attacked Iraq
           in a war that has no international legal sanction;


       (b)  that the earliest victims of the military campaign are  innocent
           Iraqi children and women from  the  resulting  humanitarian  and
           environmental disasters;


       (c)  that the invasion of Afghanistan by the same military powers has
           not, as yet, produced tangible commitments to the reconstruction
           and development of Afghanistan, as promised in  the  preinvasion
           period;  and


       (d)  the regime change in Afghanistan has not  produced  peace  since
           internecine fighting and human rights abuses  continue  in  that
           country;


  (2) therefore condemns  the  American  and  British  attack  on  innocent
       civilians;


  (3) calls for more drastic measures to ensure  that  the  promised  peace
       settlement in postwar Iraq is not a remote vision;


  (4)  appreciates  the  efforts  of  peace-loving  people   worldwide   in
       expressing solidarity with the Iraqi people; and


  (5) thanks members of Parliament  and  the  provincial  legislatures  for
       demonstrating their antiwar position by picketing this afternoon,  27
       March 2003, on the corner of Wale and Adderley Streets; and


  (6) appeals to the United Nations and the Security Council to -
       (a)  resume its humanitarian aid programme;


       (b)  call on America and Britain to immediately stop the war;


       (c)  institute measures to ensure that the invading parties also bear
           the cost of constructing postwar Iraq; and


       (d)  call on these forces to disarm Iraq peacefully for the  sake  of
           peace in the world.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  Is  there  any  objection  to  that  motion?
[Interjections.] Yes, there is  an  objection.  The  motion  will  therefore
become a notice of motion.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, mine wasn't an objection, it is ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: There was an objection from Mr Lever.

Mr L G LEVER: No, Chairperson, I want to propose an amendment.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Oh, you wish to propose  an  amendment.  You're
not objecting. All right. What is the  amendment  you  wish  to  propose?  I
noted Mr Lever first, and then I'll come to you, Mr Van Niekerk.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, that this Council  also  condemn  Saddam  Hussein
for defying the UN Security Council's resolutions to disarm for a period  of
12 years. [Interjections.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, this is a motion  with  wide  consequences.
We have not had insight into it at all. My request is merely that we  get  a
copy of it and take a decision later so that we  can  see  what  it  is  all
about, because there are some details that will have consequential effects.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon  member,  that  is  not  an  amendment.  Mr
Taabe, you have a proposed amendment from Mr Lever.
Mr T B TAABE: Chair, I honestly would not accede to that very cheap  request
to amend this meticulously crafted motion. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I then put the motion. Is there  any  objection
to the motion? There is an objection. The motion therefore becomes a  notice
of motion.

      SO-CALLED POLITICAL FIREBRAND DEPRIVES PAC OF PARLIAMENTARY SEAT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Madam Chairperson,  hon  Minister  in  the  House,  I  move
without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with amazement that the so-called political  firebrand  of  the
       PAC which  had  described  the  defection  legislation  as  political
       prostitution, and had vehemently opposed the legislation all the  way
       up to the Constitutional Court, has now found it  convenient  to  use
       the very legislation to deprive the  PAC  of  one  of  its  seats  in
       Parliament; and


  (2) further notes that this goes to corroborate an African  truism  that,
       "motshega-kgaretswana ke ena monyadi wa yona", literally meaning that
       a person who laughs at a young  girl,  very  often  is  the  one  who
       ultimately marries her.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            LACK OF CIVILITY DISPLAYED BY SOME MEMBERS OF THE TAC

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes with concern the lack of civility displayed by some leaders  of
       the Treatment Action Campaign towards  the  Minister  of  Health,  Dr
       Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, during an official engagement;


  (2) believes that while rigorous debate and the right to peaceful protest
       is an  essential  requirement  for  democracy,  this  should  not  be
       confused with disrespect towards others;


  (3) is of the opinion that the level  of  disrespect  shown  towards  the
       Minister by the TAC leadership exceeded all bounds of civility; and


  (4) therefore calls upon them to unreservedly apologise to  the  Minister
       so as to dispel any suspicion that their tactics  are  calculated  to
       encourage ordinary TAC members to show the same level  of  disrespect
       towards Ministers and other elected public representatives.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              APPRECIATION FOR DETAILED RESPONSE TO RESOLUTION
                    ON SA EXPRESS FLIGHT 1607 BY MINISTER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) further to a motion moved by Ms J N Vilakazi on 16 May 2002 regarding
       SA Express Flight 1607 on the Johannesburg-Richards Bay Route,  notes
       with appreciation the  detailed  response  to  the  above  resolution
       received from Mr J Radebe, the Minister of Public Enterprises;


  (2) acknowledges the input from SA Express in this regard,  supports  the
       suggestion of the testing of market response to the introduction of a
       new flight on the said route, in terms of  advance  reservation,  and
       accepts that should market response not  be  favourable,  the  flight
       would not be introduced; and


  (3) expresses the hope that in testing the  market  response,  sufficient
       energy is put into advertising the  said  flight,  as  otherwise  the
       results yielded on the advance booking may not truly  reflect  actual
       demand.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       HOSPITALISATION OF MS NTLABATI

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern -


       (a)  the  hospitalisation  of  Ms  Ntlabati  in  the  Southern  Cross
           Hospital since last Thursday;


       (b)  that Ms Ntlabati has been in the Intensive Care Unit since then;


       (c)  that whilst her condition is critical, it remains stable; and


  (2) therefore -


       (a)  wishes her a speedy recovery;


       (b)  urges members to visit her when they are able to; and


       (c)  expresses its sympathy to the family.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

     APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONERS TO YOUTH COMMISSION TO BE REFERRED TO
                         COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson,  I  move  that  subject  to  the
concurrence of the National Assembly, the request from the Minister  in  the
Presidency regarding the  appointment  of  commissioners  to  serve  on  the
National Youth Commission, the term of office of the  current  commissioners
coming to an end on 30 June  2003,  be  referred  to  the  Joint  Monitoring
Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and Status  of  Children,  Youth
and Disabled Persons  for  consideration  in  terms  of  section  4  of  the
National Youth Commission Act, Act 19 of 1996, the committee  to  report  to
this House by no later than 28 May 2003.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL

 (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Social Services
                                  thereon)
Ms N C KONDLO: Madam Chairperson, the National Development Agency  Amendment
Bill  is  merely  a  technical  Bill  which  seeks  to  amend  the  National
Development Agency Act of 1998 in the following ways.

The Bill amends the definition of "Minister" from the "Minister of  Finance"
to the "Minister of Social  Development".  With  the  promulgation  of  this
Bill, the responsibility of the NDA will rest entirely with the Minister  of
Social Development.

Secondly, the number of members of the board representing civil society  has
been reduced from nine members to six members, and those  of  Government  to
five. According to the department, this reduction  was  based  on  financial
considerations, and the committee could find no fault with that rationale.

The term "civil society organisations"  has  been  changed  to  read  "civil
society". This takes on board the fact that any member of  the  public  will
have the right in his or her personal capacity as well as  a  representative
of an organisation to serve on the board. This consideration brings  welcome
relief to communities, especially those from the rural areas  that  are  not
organised into recognised formal  structures.  Individuals  from  these  and
similar communities will now be afforded an equal opportunity  to  serve  on
the board.

The Minister will, on the recommendation  of  the  board,  appoint  a  chief
executive officer. In addition, through the  amendment  to  section  9,  the
Minister will be able to retain the link between  the  National  Development
Agency and the Department of Social Development so that the two can  operate
in tandem, rather than in isolation from each other.

The Select Committee on Social Services, therefore,  having  considered  the
Bill, is in full  agreement  with  the  Bill  as  amended  by  the  National
Assembly's Portfolio Committee on Social Development. I thank you, Chair.

Debate concluded.
Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon  members,  please  note  that  there  is  a
typographical error on the Order Paper. The Bill is Bill  9D  of  2003,  not
Bill 9D of 2002.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Chairperson, hon  members,  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill is the embodiment of co-operative governance, which is  at  the
heart of our Constitution. The  division  of  resources  amongst  the  three
spheres of government is one of  the  most  critical  steps  in  the  Budget
process, as it provides the basis for the preparation of the national,  nine
provincial and 284 municipal budgets for the next financial year.

The Division of Revenue Bill, 2003, gives effect to section  214(1)  of  the
Constitution and to the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act, 1997,  which
require an annual Act of Parliament to provide for  the  equitable  division
of revenue anticipated to be raised nationally amongst the three spheres  of
government.

The Bill this year is much thicker, larger and, I  dare  say,  better.  It's
thicker because each local government grant is allocated  over  three  years
to  284  municipalities,  hence  the  large  number  of  schedules  in   the
explanatory  memorandum.  The  Bill  is  better  because  it  achieved  this
objective of publishing local government grants per municipality,  for  both
the national and municipal financial year.

The  explanatory  attachments  also  contain  detailed  information  on  the
formula for the provincial and local  equitable  share  allocations,  and  a
detailed framework on each conditional grant to a province or  municipality.
The Bill therefore provides critical  information  for  every  province  and
municipality, and for every national and provincial department, in order  to
prepare their budgets.

I want to emphasise that the Bill deals  with  aggregate  allocations  only,
and not how these funds are to be spent. The national  Government  allocates
its equitable share allocation through the Appropriation Bill. Each  of  the
nine provinces and  284  municipalities  will  follow  the  tabling  of  the
national  Budget  by  tabling  their  own  budgets,  indicating  how   these
allocations are to be spent. In fact, all of the provinces have  now  tabled
their  respective  budgets  already.  This  is  in   accordance   with   our
Constitution,  which  creates  three  spheres  of   government   which   are
distinctive,  interdependent  and  interrelated,  each  with  the  power  to
determine its own budget.

This Bill therefore does not appropriate for the budgets of  departments  or
sectors, and does not indicate what outputs the  allocations  will  buy  and
what outcomes will be accomplished. In making these  allocations,  the  Bill
indirectly challenges  Parliament,  provincial  legislatures  and  municipal
councils to put  in  place  adequate  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the  294
budgets, collectively, give effect to Government priorities, and  to  ensure
that monitoring and accountability mechanisms  for  the  spending  of  these
funds allocated are in place and, indeed, are continually strengthened.

In  order  to  provide   information   and   spending   by   provinces   and
municipalities, we will be tabling the 2003 Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review
in this House on 8 April. This document  covers  both  the  2003  provincial
budgets and the 2002 local government  budgets.  Such  spending  information
will also be complemented in provinces by the tabling of strategic plans  of
departments.

These documents are all meant to deepen  the  budget  oversight  process  in
Parliament and the  nine  provincial  legislatures.  They  will  assist  the
portfolio  and  select  committees  in   Parliament   and   the   provincial
legislatures to benchmark and compare departmental  budgets  with  those  in
other provinces. They should provide  nonfinancial  performance  information
linked to the budget.
By providing all this information we are shaping  the  role  of  Parliament,
provincial legislatures  and  municipal  councils  in  the  budget  approval
process, by putting at their disposal information that can be used to  begin
to evaluate whether the budgets we request them to approve are true  to  our
commitment of a better life for all.

We are also laying the basis for accountability for  performance,  both  in-
year through quarterly reports, and after the  end  of  the  financial  year
through annual reports. This oversight is even more difficult for a  complex
intergovernmental system such as  ours.  The  challenge  facing  Parliament,
provincial legislatures and municipal councils is to be  able  to  use  this
information to influence performance and the quality  of  service  delivery.
It is only with strong  oversight  that  we  can  deliver  more  and  better
services to our people. Such oversight is the right thing to do.

In this respect, the two parliamentary portfolio and select  committees  for
a provincial function may want to convene workshops  with  their  colleagues
in provincial portfolio committees to share and discuss the  information  in
the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, the Estimates of  National  Expenditure
and provincial strategic plans before adopting the budget of the  department
in their own legislatures.

The process of making budget decisions  is  at  the  heart  of  co-operative
governance, as envisaged by  the  Constitution.  The  Budget  is  driven  by
policy priorities determined through a consultative  process  involving  the
three  spheres  of  government.  The  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  and   its
underlying allocations are the culmination  of  this  consultation  process,
which began soon after the 2002 Budget. This consultation  process  involved
the Budget Council which includes all provincial MECs of  Finance,  and  the
Budget Forum which  includes  Salga  and  its  provincial  local  government
associations.

A joint MinMec with local government MECs  and  organised  local  government
was also held, and premiers and the chairperson of Salga were invited to  an
extended Cabinet meeting, which decided on the  divisions  set  out  in  the
Bill before this House today. We follow  this  process  because  it  is  the
right thing to do. At least somebody is  awake  in  the  House.  [Laughter.]
Thank you, Chief Whip.

In making the decisions regarding the allocation of revenue  anticipated  to
be raised nationally amongst the three spheres, Government  has  also  taken
into account the recommendations of the FFC. The explanatory  memorandum  to
the Bill, or Part 2 of Annexure E, provides the formal response of  national
Government to the 2003 proposals of the Financial and Fiscal Commission.

The Budget builds on and takes further the policy priorities  laid  down  in
the previous two years. It signals Government's recognition that  provincial
and local governments are at the coalface of delivery of  services  intended
to ensure progressive realisation of the basic social and economic needs  of
our people. The Bill  enables  provincial  and  local  governments  to  give
effect to the Government priority of  reducing  poverty  and  vulnerability.
What  we  now  need  is  targeted  resource  allocations  to  address  these
challenges.

The heart of the Division of Revenue Bill is  Schedule  1,  which  allocates
funds to the three spheres of government. Of the R334Â billion in the  Budget
for  the  new  fiscal   year,   the   national   Government   is   allocated
R185,2Â billion. This  allocation  includes  R54Â billion  for  debt-servicing
costs and the contingency reserve,  leaving  the  national  Government  with
R138Â billion to allocate to national departments and for conditional  grants
to provincial and local governments.

Schedule 1 also  allocates  the  provincial  equitable  share  amounting  to
R142Â billion,  and  the  local  government  equitable  share  amounting   to
R6,3Â billion. Schedule 2 allocates provincial equitable share, and  Schedule
3  reflects  allocations   of   local   government   equitable   share   per
municipality.

The total allocation for provinces - including  both  conditional  grants  -
increases from R137Â billion in the present fiscal year  to  R159Â billion  in
the new year, rising to R192Â billion in the fiscal year  which  ends  on  31
March 2006. This reflects  strong  real  growth  in  national  transfers  to
provinces of 6,1% a year over the next three years, and has, in  fact,  even
calmed down the very effusive MEC, Mr Godongwana.

The  total  local  government  share,  inclusive  of   conditional   grants,
increases from  R8,8Â billion  this  year  to  R12Â billion  in  2003-04,  and
R14,6Â billion two years later. The local share increases  rapidly  at  12,2%
in real terms per annum.

Schedules 4 to 7 allocate conditional and  other  grants  to  provinces  and
local  government.  Provinces  receive  conditional  grants   amounting   to
R16,6Â billion in 2003-04,  increasing  the  provincial  share  of  allocated
funds available after debt servicing to 56,8%. Local government  receives  a
further R6,3Â billion in conditional grants, bringing its share  to  4,3%  of
allocated expenditure.

The 2003 Budget maintains strong  growth  in  the  allocation  targeted  for
provincial  infrastructure  development   and   maintenance,   rising   from
R1,6Â billion in the present  year  to  R3Â billion  two  years  later.  As  a
result, provinces will receive  R8Â billion  from  the  infrastructure  grant
over the three-year period, an increase of 25% a  year.  It  is  anticipated
that provinces will use this grant effectively to deal  with  infrastructure
backlogs in schools, health facilities and provincial roads.

The infrastructure programme in  the  health  sector  is  further  supported
through increased allocations for  the  hospital  revitalisation  programme,
from R649Â million in the current year to R1Â billion in  the  third  year  of
the MTEF, with 18 additional hospitals earmarked for major rehabilitation.

The allocation to provinces further reinforces spending  to  reduce  poverty
and vulnerability  through  increased  allocation  for  social  security  to
provide for increases in values of grants  and  further  extensions  of  the
social security net, with particular focus on children.
A new conditional grant, which provides for  the  phased  extension  of  the
child support grant to children until  they  turn  14,  is  introduced.  The
phasing in will take place over the next three  years.  The  allocation  for
the child support extension grant  amounts  to  R10,9Â billion  in  the  2003
MTEF. Support targeted at poor children is further enhanced by increases  of
about 21% a year in the allocation of the integrated nutrition programme.

The Budget strengthens Government's efforts to deal with  pressures  arising
from HIV/Aids on provincial  budgets.  Earmarked  allocations  for  HIV/Aids
amount to R2,1Â billion over the three-year period.  In  addition,  provinces
are also expected to allocate at least R1Â billion more in this  year's  MTEF
from their budgets towards HIV/Aids programmes for  prevention  and  support
to those infected and affected.

I'd like to draw the attention of the distinguished members of this  Council
to the fact that in the Budget this year we were able to  take  forward  the
relationship between  the  national  Government  and  provincial  government
significantly. We were able to find  additional  resources,  which  some  in
national Government would have wanted as new conditional grants.

The provinces were able to demonstrate that they could allocate  that  money
to specific areas without a conditional grant. Those areas include  what  we
now call in Education, for  instance,  noncapital/nonpersonnel  expenditure.
These are things like school books, maths  kits,  laboratories  in  schools,
starting with the provision of libraries in the poorest of our schools,  and
so on. Those kinds of things will make a difference to the outcomes.

That we can take this forward in the true spirit of co-operative  governance
is,  I  think,  a  tribute  to   the   endeavour   of   provinces   in   the
interrelationship and the way in which the Budget  Council  has  matured  in
its dealings. So I would like to express a special word of  appreciation  to
all the provinces for that fact, which  we  have  now  demonstrated  in  the
change.

In respect of local government, the substantial increase  in  its  share  is
mainly targeted towards the provision of free basic services, the  extension
of services to  areas  not  currently  serviced  and  job  creation  through
investment   in   labour-based   infrastructure   programmes.   In    total,
R4,1Â billion over the 2003 MTEF is made available  for  water,  electricity,
refuse  removal  and  sanitation  as  part  of  Government's  commitment  to
providing free basic services.

In  addition  to  the  tax  incentives  announced  in  the  Budget   Speech,
infrastructure grants to municipalities remain a  key  instrument  in  urban
renewal and rural development. An  additional  R1,8Â billion  over  the  next
three  years  is   allocated   for   infrastructure   delivery,   increasing
infrastructure grants to local government to about R14Â billion.

Capacity-building continues to be an important programme in order to  enable
effective service delivery by municipalities. The  allocation  is  increased
by R300Â million over the three years, to a total of  R2,4Â billion  over  the
Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework.  Spending  will  focus   on   financial
management and reform, and on improving  strategic  management  and  service
delivery skills. We need to emphasise the need to build in-house  skills  in
municipalities, in  order  to  deliver  services  effectively,  by  offering
internship programmes to our recent graduates to  achieve  equitable  skills
development.

The Bill also respects accountability for municipal  services  by  requiring
nonmunicipal public entities that provide municipal services to respect  the
service authority role of the relevant municipality and adhere to the  Local
Government: Municipal Systems Act as an external service provider.  Clearly,
there's a big issue in respect of the distribution of energy. In some  cases
Eskom is doing it itself; in other cases local authorities are doing it.  So
getting into that interface, especially in respect of the provision of  free
basic services, becomes an enormous challenge  for  local  government.  This
will  enable  municipalities,   we   believe,   to   take   full   political
responsibility for providing basic services to former  townships  and  rural
areas.

The Bill  also  makes  provision  for  municipalities  to  adhere  to  basic
financial  reporting  norms  and  standards,   and   hence   improve   their
accountability on the use of the equitable share allocations prior  even  to
the enactment of the Municipal Finance Management Bill.

I  want  to  conclude  by  noting  that  it  is  now  six  years  since  the
introduction of the  current  fiscal  framework  for  provincial  and  local
government. Much has happened since the creation of our nine  provinces  and
municipalities, including the passage of the  foundation-laying  legislation
for the establishment of co-operative  governance  institutions  like  those
I've mentioned - the Budget Council and the Budget Forum, and MinMecs.

We are now better aware of the spending responsibilities  of  provinces  and
local governments, and need to review  our  formulae  for  allocating  these
grants. The impending publication of Census 2001's results later  this  year
provides us with a golden opportunity to do this.

For provinces, the National Treasury intends to lead  a  process  to  review
all grants to provincial governments, and the  formulae  for  the  equitable
share and all conditional grants.

On local government, the review will be even more comprehensive, given  that
many  more  significant  changes  have  occurred  or  are  still  occurring.
National Government is therefore proposing that the comprehensive review  of
the local government fiscal system include an assessment of whether  current
revenue-raising powers match the functions of various categories  and  types
of municipalities, the tax-raising powers  of  local  government  and  their
assignment within the local sphere,  the  future  of  the  RSC  levies,  the
feasibility of municipal levies on key municipal services  like  electricity
and water, and the division of  fiscal  powers  between  category  B  and  C
municipalities.

The review will also  include  the  formula  for  the  equitable  share  and
conditional grants. It must include the phasing in of other grants, such  as
water service  operating  subsidies,  into  the  equitable  share.  National
Treasury will convene key stakeholders for the  review,  including  national
departments  -  this  includes  the  Department  of  Provincial  and   Local
Government, the Department of Minerals and Energy,  and  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry -  Salga  and  the  FFC.  The  Budget  Forum  and
Cabinet will consider the proposals for implementation in the 2004 Budget.

The  information  that  accompanies  this  Bill  goes   beyond   the   legal
requirements set out in the Constitution and other  relevant  statutes.  The
additional  information  provided  with  the  Bill  represents,  I  believe,
another milestone in enhancing political  oversight  and  transparency,  and
ensuring accountability. More  importantly,  the  allocation  of  all  local
government grants per municipality further deepens  co-operative  governance
in the budget allocation process.

In commending the Bill to the Council here, I do so with  the  fervent  hope
that the Bill, together with the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review,  will  be
taken forward by members of this Council to ensure that not only members  of
provincial legislatures but also our people have an  insight  into  what  is
allocated, and ensure that we can remain accountable and  committed  to  the
principles of Batho Pele. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson of the NCOP, hon  Minister,  special  delegates
and hon members, I think the report we adopted just before this debate  will
give details of the committee's discussion achievements, as a result of  the
recommendations we have been making to departments over the  years  and  the
further recommendations on issues we would like to see improved  on  by  the
government departments.

Therefore, I will not elaborate on that because the report is  in  the  ATC.
Also, I will not elaborate on the details of the Bill, because I  think  the
Minister has dealt adequately with that. However, I will touch  on  some  of
the key issues that in  my  view  and  the  opinion  of  the  committee  are
critical. Other members of the committee will also deal with that.

March is the human rights months, because many heroes and  heroines  of  our
struggle died on 21 March 1961 at the hands of the apartheid  regime,  while
peacefully  protesting  against  the  regime.  Our  Constitution,  which  is
informed by our history  and  the  circumstances  that  surround  us  today,
should give us the vision of where we are going and, also,  that  we  should
not repeat the mistakes of the past.

Sections 25(5), 26(1) and 26(2) of the Bill of Rights -  Chapter  2  of  the
Constitution - give the right to housing; sections 27(1),  27(2)  and  27(3)
refer to health care, food, water  and  social  security;  section  28(1)(c)
refers to every child having the right to basic  nutrition,  shelter,  basic
health care services and  social  services;  whilst  section  29  refers  to
everyone having the right to education, including children.

It is therefore important to properly place the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill
discussion in the context I outlined above, which is that all the  resources
allocated to the  three  spheres  of  government  respond  directly  to  the
supreme law of our land, which  is  the  Constitution  and,  in  particular,
refer  directly  to  the  Bill  of  Rights,  issues  contained  therein  and
specifically to the sections I have referred to.

We have seen significant improvement in the Division of Revenue  legislation
over the years. In 2003-04 the Bill that we are  talking  about,  currently,
has clearly given municipalities their allocation for the  first  time,  and
those allocations are published. This, amongst  other  reasons,  is  because
the powers and functions of  category  B  and  C  municipalities  have  been
finalised. Hence, it was easy to determine who gets what from the  equitable
share, the nationally raised revenue.
All municipalities by now know and can plan their  budgets  with  certainty.
This is also because their allocation covers the MTEF  period  or  the  MTEF
cycle,  which  is  over  three  years.  In  the  past,  we  have  made   the
recommendation that conditional grants be rationalised and, where  possible,
incorporated  into  the  equitable   share,   particularly   because   small
conditional grants in certain provinces tended not to be spent  because  the
provinces said it was too much of a tedious process for them  to  apply  for
those grants. Therefore these recommendations were in line with that.

We are therefore happy to report to the House that some of the grants  have,
indeed, been incorporated into the equitable share, and that others  are  in
the process of being incorporated. But with other grants, there  is  also  a
clear case, a reason, for them to continue as conditional grants.

A case in point is the early childhood  development  grant  that  in  coming
years  will  no  longer  be  regarded  as  a  grant,  but  instead  will  be
incorporated  into  the  equitable  share.  More  information,  particularly
around the census, will further assist the provinces  in  making  sure  that
all children who belong to Grade R  directly  benefit  from  this  grant  or
these resources.

We have also reported to this House that there  has  been  underspending  in
some of the grants, but that has since improved with a  few  exceptions.  We
are  convinced  that  the  Department  of  Health  in  particular  and   the
Department of Housing will  address  the  situation,  and  that  the  select
committee concerned and  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  will  use  the
quarterly reports that are published in the national Government  Gazette  to
monitor whether spending is happening according to the framework  stipulated
in the Division of Revenue Bill.

We are also happy to report that the school nutrition  programme,  in  which
underspending has been reported in the past, is,  from  next  year  onwards,
going to be incorporated into the Education department Budget Vote,  because
we believe that the Education department has  a  better  infrastructure  and
systems to be able  to  deliver.  However,  there  has  been  a  significant
increase in this grant. Therefore we think  that  members,  in  doing  their
constituency work, and the relevant select  committees  should  be  able  to
take up these matters with the respective departments.

In the report we have cited and that  I  talk  about  in  the  ATC  are  new
recommendations, which are informed by the discussion which  took  place  in
the committee during the public hearings. We noted in  some  provinces  that
there was difficulty in the co-ordination between two departments and  among
the spheres of government.

To cite a case in point: in Gauteng, for instance, housing is not  delivered
because  the  environmental  policies  which  are  stringent   inhibit   the
construction of houses. So we do believe, in terms of the co-ordination  and
integration we have been talking about, that we should strive for  this  and
that all select committees, including provinces and special  delegates  that
are here, should go back to their provinces and ensure that we do away  with
these things in our system.

The committee believes that it is  the  responsibility  of  all  members  of
Parliament and provincial legislatures to keep departments on their toes  by
checking whether budgets are  talking  directly  and  responding  to  policy
priorities, because the PFMA requires them to do so by  clearly  stipulating
that budgets should also result in measurable outputs. Therefore this is  in
the interests of the country and in the interests of what you get  from  the
money you spend.

In the Bill before the House we have a new provision in terms of the  duties
of  the  Auditor-General,  in  that  the  Auditor-General  may   audit   the
conditional grants, and the report should be tabled in Parliament. We  think
this is a step in the right direction as it will allow  us  to  engage  with
the  report,  and  to  evaluate  whether  accounting  officers  are   indeed
complying with the spirit  and  letter  of  the  law.  In  the  past  people
complied with the PFMA, but without those things  necessarily  resulting  in
adequate measures.

However, the Auditor-General has raised serious matters with  the  committee
that we think we should  raise  before  the  House.  Some  departments  -  I
repeat, some departments - both at national and  provincial  level,  do  not
pay their audit fees on time - beyond periods of 30 days,  60  days  and  90
days. Therefore that results in cash flow project problems in the Office  of
the Auditor General. We do  think  that  the  departments  concerned  should
raise these issues sharply and that all  members  who  belong  to  different
committees, in their engagement with departments, should raise these  issues
sharply.

We also think that the Auditor-General must put in place  adequate  measures
to collect these debts and come to Parliament and raise  these  issues  when
the   situation   has   reached   disproportionate   levels.   Also,    some
municipalities do not pay their fees on time, primarily because they do  not
necessarily have the necessary revenue to do so. I think that  there  should
be some mechanism of differentiating in those cases.

In our discussion it became clear that  some  municipalities  needed  to  be
supported,  and  this  is  also  provided  for  by  section   154   of   the
Constitution. In terms of this section, national Government  and  provincial
governments,   by   legislative   and   other   measures,    must    support
municipalities. Therefore we think that  the  conditional  grants  that  are
aimed at doing so must be  directed  at  municipalities  which  have  little
capacity. This is because, when we had a discussion with the  Department  of
Minerals and Energy, we were informed that certain  municipalities  returned
their moneys because they could not spend them. Therefore those monies  have
to be allocated to other municipalities with capacity.

Lastly, we  noted  with  interest  that  the  relevant  national  Government
departments have not made funds  available  to  nodal  points  in  different
provinces and in relevant municipalities. We would like to make  the  appeal
that nodal points be funded by all stakeholders concerned, who are  supposed
to be continuing funding until those projects have  been  completed  and  we
see the difference. Failure to do so would  undermine,  or  has  undermined,
the very noble objective that the President talked about when  he  announced
these nodal points.

Therefore we think that it is important that national departments, who  have
not come to the party and pledged their resources  to  this  effect,  do  so
without fail. I make the appeal that members of the  committee,  who  belong
to the Department of Provincial and Local Government  and  other  committees
which are supposed to be forwarding funds to this effect, also  engage  with
them. However, we will continue our engagement with this department.

I do believe that all conditional grants, as reflected in the  Bill  and  in
the different budgets of provinces, directly respond to  the  constitutional
provision I talked  about.  I  also  hope  that  all  of  us  will  actively
participate in ensuring that the noble goals enshrined in  our  Constitution
are, indeed, realised, and that our country becomes a beacon of hope in  the
future for all who live in it, black and white.

We would like to call upon the House to  support  the  Bill  before  it,  as
amended by the select committee. We chose deliberately  not  to  talk  about
the  technicalities  of  the  Bill,  but  rather  to  concentrate   on   the
conditional grants. The equitable  share  of  this  portion  is  dealt  with
extensively by provincial legislatures. I do  thank  you,  Chairperson,  and
the hon members for listening. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I now call the hon Godongwana,  the  MEC
for finance, economic affairs and  environmental  affairs  and  tourism  ...
[Laughter.] ... of the Eastern Cape!

Mr E GODONGWANA (Eastern Cape): Madam Chairperson,  hon  members,  the  test
for any intergovernmental fiscal relations system is its ability to  achieve
both vertical and horizontal equity. This budget is  attempting  to  grapple
with that delicate balance.
As the Minister would attest, our critique from the Eastern Cape has  always
been that the provincial share of the nationally  raised  revenue  has  been
declining - from 58% in 1998 to about 56%. That, in our view,  is  happening
in the context of too much pressure on provincial budgets  in  the  form  of
social services, such as social security. In our view that  would  therefore
create, what we would call, vertical  imbalances.  We  are  pleased  at  the
moment that that matter is being addressed.

In terms of the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  the  provincial  share
begins to rise -  up  to  57%  of  nationally  raised  revenue.  An  equally
important point is the increase in the local government sphere.

We are also pleased that the Eastern Cape tops  the  rest  by  getting  R1,5
billion in this current financial year, rising  to  R1,7  billion  and  R1,9
billion over the MTEF period. That, in itself, is  an  important  milestone.
The fact, also, that  local  governments  now  have  certainty  about  their
budgets - four months into their financial year, they know  the  figures  up
front - we hope will assist in the planning process.  Equally  important  is
the format in which budgets are presented.  It  enhances  accountability  of
executives and assists in the oversight process by the legislatures.

This budget is also an attack on poverty in that it is pro-poor. It  focuses
on the vulnerable of our society - the  old,  the  disabled,  children  from
poor backgrounds. In the context of our province, the  Eastern  Cape,  where
the majority of our population - more that 60% -  is  rural,  we  have  been
able, with the growth in our budgets, to focus on what we  call  "the  rapid
impact programme", a key element of which is agriculture. I  am  pleased  to
announce that our budget for agriculture has been increased  by  almost  41%
in the coming financial year.

Also, a fundamental part of our rapid impact  programme  is  infrastructure.
Because infrastructure is critical in crowding in investment, it creates  an
environment conducive for growth in the economy. The focus  in  this  budget
has been on this infrastructure. We have about  R6  billion  over  the  MTEF
which, in itself, is an important development.

In the light of the above, we support the Bill with the amendments  attached
to it. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Agb Voorsitter, agbare Minister van  Finansies  en  kollegas,
daar is vanjaar weer, soos in vorige jare, wyd  gekonsulteer  en  onderhoude
en gesprek gevoer oor hierdie belangrike onderwerp wat 'n wye  spektrum  van
belanghebbendes raak, naamlik die wetsontwerp op die verdeling van  inkomste
van 2003.

Hierdie     wetsontwerp      gee,      met      inagneming      van      die
bestedingsverantwoordelikhede  van   staatsdepartemente,   van   provinsiale
regerings en van munisipaliteite, beslag  aan  die  verdeling  van  inkomste
tussen die drie vlakke van regering.

Aspekte van vanjaar se voorleggings aan die  Gekose  Komitee  oor  Finansies
wat aandag getrek en kommer gewek het, was, onder andere, die bewering  deur
die Buffalo City Metro dat daar heelwat staatsdepartemente is wat belasting-
 en dienstegelde  aan  hom  verskuldig  is,  asook  die  stelling  deur  die
Ouditeur-generaal dat vele munisipaliteite nie hul  fooie  vir  oudits,  wat
deur die Grondwet vereis word, aan hom betaal nie.

Aangesien die Ouditeur-generaal nie 'n begrotingstoekenning ontvang  nie  en
finansieel van sy ouditfooie afhanklik is, is dit dwingend  noodsaaklik  dat
daar spoedig aandag hieraan gegee word.  'n  Moontlikheid  wat  oorweeg  kan
word, is die weerhouding of vertraging van 'n gedeelte van die  oorbetalings
aan 'n  munisipaliteit  of  munisipaliteite  weens  hul  erge  en  volgehoue
materiÃ«le verbreking van tesourienorme en standaarde. Een van diÃ©  norme  en
standaarde is die vereiste dat  statutÃªre  finansiÃ«le  verpligtings  nagekom
word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of Finance and colleagues,  as
was the case in previous  years,  extensive  consultations,  interviews  and
discussions were once again held this year regarding this important  subject
affecting a wide spectrum of interested  parties,  namely  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill, 2003.

This  Bill  gives  effect,  with   due   allowance   for   the   expenditure
responsibilities of Government departments, of  provincial  governments  and
of municipalities, to the division of revenue between  the  three  tiers  of
government.

Aspects of this year's submissions to the Select Committee on Finance  which
attracted attention and caused concern were, inter alia, the  allegation  by
the Buffalo City  Metro  that  there  were  quite  a  number  of  Government
departments that owed income  and  service  fees  to  it,  as  well  as  the
statement by the Auditor-General that many municipalities  do  not  pay  him
their fees for audits, as required by the Constitution.

Since the Auditor-General does  not  receive  a  budget  allocation  and  is
financially dependent on his audit fees, it is  of  the  greatest  necessity
that attention be given to this as soon as possible. A possibility that  may
be considered is that of  withholding  or  delaying  part  of  the  transfer
payments to a municipality or municipalities as a result  of  their  serious
and sustained material violation of treasury norms  and  standards.  One  of
these norms and  standards  is  the  requirement  that  statutory  financial
obligations should be met.]

Section 214(2)  of  the  Constitution  requires  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission  to  make  recommendations  on  the  division  of  revenue   and,
obviously, on matters related thereto.

The FFC duly made a variety of  recommendations  which  were  considered.  I
will only refer to the FFC's proposals as far as  provincial  government  is
concerned, namely those on provincial own revenue.

Allow me to refer to the national Government's response to these  proposals,
with which I fully agree, namely  that  it  recognises  the  need  for  more
improvements   in   existing   provincial   revenue   collection   capacity,
particularly  in  the  area  of  motor  licence  fees   and   road   traffic
enforcement. A further improvement, which has been initiated, is  a  revenue
classification project which ensures that all revenue collected is  properly
classified and reconciled with the financial management system.

I mentioned that I agree with these responses, the reason being  that  I  am
still not convinced that provinces  fully  exploit  their  existing  revenue
collection possibilities.  The  New  NP  supports  this  principle  and  the
details of the Division of Revenue Bill, 2003.

Let me conclude by saying that the New NP has thrown off  some  dead  weight
which might have, and most probably would have, become a serious  liability,
nay an embarrassment, and which would undoubtedly have tried to sabotage  us
in the implementation of our stated policy of co-operative and  constructive
engagement with the Government. [Interjections.]

We, in the New NP, remain convinced that we have chosen the right course  to
make South Africa work for all  its  people.  We  will  not  falter  in  our
resolve to follow that course and to fulfil our promise to our  voters  that
we will steer them away from isolation, away from marginalisation  and  away
from polarisation, because, in the words of the  hon  Minister  of  Finance,
"It is the right thing to do."

Ons staan by die mense wat aan die nuwe Suid-Afrika bou. Ons  staan  by  die
mense wat aan die nuwe Suid-Afrikaanse nasie bou, want,  geagte  Voorsitter,
dit is die regte ding om te doen. Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[We stand by the people who are building the new South Africa. We  stand  by
the people who are building the  new  South  African  nation,  because,  hon
Chairperson, it is the right thing to do. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr  G  A  LUCAS:  Hon  Chairperson  ...  [Interjections.]  Hon  Krumbock  is
disturbing me here. He is fighting his battles with  the  New  NP.  I'm  not
sure how I come into that.

Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon MEC from the  Eastern  Cape  and  special
delegates, hon permanent  delegates,  the  tide  has  turned.  The  people's
contract for a better tomorrow is  taking  shape.  These  were  the  closing
remarks by the President during the State of the Nation address.

Clearly, this Division of Revenue Bill expresses explicitly the  letter  and
spirit of our  President  and  Government's  assertion  that  the  tide  has
turned. Not only has  it  increased  revenue  allocation  to  provinces  and
municipalities, but for the first time it has  created  budgetary  certainty
for our local municipalities.

Our provincial budget has increased substantially by  13,5%.  This  increase
is both as a result  of  the  Division  of  Revenue's  allocations  and  the
province's own revenue collection. This expanded provincial  budget  clearly
creates the space and scope to intensify our struggle  against  poverty  and
underdevelopment.

Overall, in monetary terms, we have R469 million to spend and invest in  the
improvement of our people's lives, unlike in the  previous  financial  year.
It is a real increase for a small province like the Northern Cape.

Accordingly, the provincial budget prioritisation is based  on  the  desired
need to a make real impact on pushing back the frontiers of  poverty.  Thus,
the social development department has received  the  largest  share  of  the
provincial budget, and has to carry both the  mandate  of  increased  social
grant payments and targeted poverty alleviation projects.

With respect to social grant payments, our  old  age  pensioners  and  other
grant recipients no longer have to suffer the  humiliation  of  long  queues
and  unfriendly  service.  Our  provincial  payment  system   has   improved
drastically, to such an extent that at all paypoints, by 12 o'clock  midday,
every pensioner or any other social grant recipient has received his or  her
payment.

This, indeed, clearly reflects our  provincial  government's  commitment  to
maintaining the dignity and respect  of  our  people,  especially  the  most
vulnerable,  in  particular  the  elderly,  people  with  disabilities   and
children.

Beyond this, our province has already put systems in place  to  ensure  that
our people benefit  from  the  food  security  programme  announced  by  our
national Government. On 21 March, the premier of the province launched  this
programme and this was fitting as the right  to  food  constitutes  a  basic
human right. Already 5Â 000 people are  benefiting  in  Galeshewe,  which  is
part of the urban renewal nodes identified by the President. This  programme
has been allocated R9Â million for this financial year.

Owing to the increased revenue base, the province established an  innovation
fund two years ago to stimulate economic growth and  development.  Thus  far
two major export-orientated projects have been launched, namely the  Paprika
Project in Namaqualand and the Goat Project in  the  Kgalagadi  rural  nodal
point. These projects have already employed more  that  1Â 000  people,  with
further employment earmarked for this year.

A further R20Â million will be allocated  to  this  fund  in  this  financial
year, with a total of R102 million over the next five  years,  in  order  to
invest in strategic economic sectors in the province. Indeed, the  tide  has
turned. The Northern Cape has  responded  to  our  President's  call  for  a
people's contract, that we unite in action to push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty.

In responding to this call our province has  made  two  major  announcements
with regard to water and sanitation. In the  Karoo  region,  where  the  hon
Sulliman comes from, some of our communities still do  not  have  access  to
water on a  daily  basis.  There  are  also  30Â 000  households  that  still
continue to use the bucket system, and this is the most  derogatory  way  of
using the bucket system.

We have therefore  committed  R30Â million  over  the  next  three  years  to
building the necessary infrastructure  for  water  provision  to  the  Karoo
region. Together with the private sector, we  will  be  able  to  raise  the
R100Â million required to construct the  water  canal  from  the  Vanderkloof
Dam. After three years, hon Sulliman,  there  will  no  longer  be  a  water
shortage in the Karoo; it will be a thing of the past. So you must smile.

The bucket system eradication programme has been allocated R90Â million  over
the next three years. By 2005, 75% of  the  bucket  system  will  have  been
wiped away from the lives of our people. That is why we  are  proud  to  say
that it is the right thing to do to support this Division of  Revenue  Bill.
There is no way that the province cannot support it. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon Chair, Minister, special delegates and  hon  members  of
this House, I feel honoured to address this House on behalf of  my  province
on such an important debate as the division of revenue  which,  in  essence,
constitutes the foundation of this House.

With regard to the Division of Revenue Bill of 2003 and developments in  our
province, I am pleased to announce the following. The  Division  of  Revenue
Bill has indeed walked the extra mile, especially with regard  to  transfers
to  local  municipalities,  a   practical   point   of   service   delivery,
particularly the rural villages, a sector that was ignored for ages  by  the
previous governments of this country.

By 31 January  this  year,  the  province  had  already  spent  79%  of  its
allocated budget for the 2002-03 financial  year,  more  than  the  national
average of 71%. My counterpart  in  the  provincial  standing  committee  on
finance in the North West hosted  a  public  hearing  across  the  province.
Municipal councillors, statutory bodies and other organs  of  civil  society
who attended these hearings articulated their views on the  distribution  of
provincial and local government equitable share  of  the  nationally  raised
revenue.

During these hearings some very insightful recommendations  were  made.  The
formula in terms of local government  equitable  shares  relating  to  rural
municipalities should be urgently reviewed and a special formula  should  be
designed to cater for their peculiarities. Rural villages  do  not  have  an
income base and offer a modest volume of basic services. The  Financial  and
Fiscal Commission is encouraged to collect and develop a  database  in  this
regard.

In addition,  clause  34(2)  of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management  Bill,  currently  under  review  in  the  national   Parliament,
requires that the Minister or the MEC responsible for finance in a  province
must, to whatever extent possible, when tabling the national  annual  Budget
in the National Assembly or the provincial annual budget in  the  provincial
legislature,  make  public  particulars  of  any  allocations  due  to  each
municipality in terms of that budget. The  annual  national  and  provincial
budgets must include the amounts to be transferred to municipalities  during
each of the next three years.

I am pleased therefore to announce that this step has  already  been  taken.
For the first time this year, a breakdown of  national  transfers  to  local
government by municipality is published in the Division of Revenue  Bill  on
Budget day  four  months  ahead  of  the  municipal  financial  year.  Early
publication  of  municipal  allocations  from  national  Government  enables
municipalities to incorporate  these  allocations  into  their  budgets,  to
improve planning and budgeting, and thus facilitate the timely execution  of
projects.  This  early   release   also   enhances   transparency   in   the
intergovernmental fiscal system.

Whereas clause 5(3)  of  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  of  2003  clearly
stipulates that each  municipality  must  receive  its  equitable  share  in
quarterly instalments, I must draw attention  to  clauseÂ 5(6)  which  allows
National Treasury, for local government, to delay or withhold  the  transfer
of an instalment on the grounds of a municipality's  serious  or  persistent
material breach of uniform Treasury norms and standards. This is similar  to
the liability of provinces.

I must also quickly give a synopsis of  other  aspects  that  are  required:
regular and prompt  submission  of  financial  statements  to  the  Auditor-
General; submission of budgets for the forthcoming  financial  year  to  the
National  Treasury,  provincial  treasury  and  the  provincial   department
responsible for local government, and  that  must  be  done  no  later  than
within 30 days; and, submission  to  the  National  Treasury,  the  national
accounting officer responsible  for  local  government  and  the  provincial
department responsible for local government no later than 10 days after  the
end of each quarter.

The North  West  provincial  budget  process  is  integrated  with  national
Government's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework to ensure  the  co-ordination
and complementary nature of programmes. The  budget  process  is  marked  by
intense planning  sessions  at  the  political  level  to  determine  policy
priorities and discussions between the provincial  treasury  and  provincial
departments.

In the North West province a  solid  foundation  for  qualitative  financial
management  has  been  established  through  improvements   in   the   asset
management system  in  that  we  will  find  better  cash  flow  management,
internal audits, and the upgrading of  the  information  technology  system.
This has prompted the  SA  Institute  of  Government  Auditors  to  say  the
following about this province:


  A high fraud awareness factor normally results in relatively lower  fraud
  occurrences. This supposition is supported by data relating to the  North
  West province. The North West province has the  highest  fraud  awareness
  factor and also the lowest incidence factor.

This is the outcome of our aggregate fiscal  prudence,  a  drive  to  ensure
more efficient service delivery, supported by  the  reforms  of  the  budget
process and management of public finances.

Some of the key achievements of the  financial  year  ending  this  weekend,
March, are the following.  Regarding  procurement  reform,  a  decentralised
procurement system will replace a centralised  one.  The  Provincial  Tender
Board Act will be repealed on  1  April,  which  will  have  the  effect  of
abolishing the current tender board and substituting it with a  departmental
tender committee.

Currently, each department  has  appointed  a  procurement  committee  whose
members were trained by the Institute of Purchasing of  SA.  The  provincial
treasury will maintain an oversight function within a  delegated  regulatory
framework. A compliance unit has already been established for this  purpose.
Of  course,  black  economic  empowerment  will  be  our  objective  through
affirmative procurement. Our province is  currently  developing  a  supplier
database with possible accreditation to ensure supplier development.

In restructuring the Public Service, the cost of personnel is a  significant
component of a budget, as you know. Our aim is to train and redeploy  skills
within the Public Service, with an exit strategy being the last resort.  The
deadline for the finalisation of this process is  30  June  this  year.  The
Government  and  organised  labour  have  agreed  on  a  framework  for  the
restructuring of the Public Service. In terms of the current  wage  Bill,  I
am pleased to announce that personnel expenditure as a percentage  has  been
reduced to 52% in the forthcoming financial year. This  is  a  reduction  of
5%.

In terms of own revenue in our province, for the first time  in  nine  years
the North West province has exceeded its revenue  collection  by  10%.  This
higher than normal collection  can,  in  the  main,  be  attributed  to  the
enhancement of internal controls and computerisation of revenue receipts.

The North West supports this Bill. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, Minister, I can't help wondering if the  Minister's
desire to do the right thing isn't a problem for his left wing.

Almal is bekend met die feit dat hulle  nÃ¡  begrotingsdag  waarskynlik  meer
gaan betaal vir hul sigarette en drankies, maar nie met die volle impak  van
die nasionale Begroting nie. Dit vervat die belangrikste besluite wat  enige
parlement neem en raak bykans alle aspekte van ons  lewens.  Dis  hier  waar
die onderskeid tussen politieke partye dikwels die duidelikste  sigbaar  is,
aangesien beleidsverskille uitdrukking vind in begrotingsprioriteite.

In baie opsigte is dit nie veel anders as 'n  huishoudelike  begroting  nie.
As jou uitgawes jou inkomste oorskry, beland jy in  die  skuld  en  moet  jy
leen om jou lewenstyl te handhaaf, wat beteken dat jy rente  betaal.  Keuses
word uitgeoefen tussen 'n nuwe motor of 'n nuwe kombuis. Hierdie  eenvoudige
beginsels geld ook vir  die  Regering.  Uiteindelik  moet  iemand  opdok  en
betaal. In die geval van die staat  is  dit  die  belastingbetaler  wat  die
rekening kry.

Die wetsontwerp op die verdeling van inkomste, wat vandag  onder  bespreking
is, bevat besonderhede oor hoe die belastingbetaler  se  geld  verdeel  word
tussen die  nasionale  Regering,  die  provinsies  en  die  munisipaliteite.
Terwyl  die  Grondwet  'n  belangrike  outonomie  verskaf   aan   diÃ©   drie
regeringsfere, is hulle tog onlosmaaklik verbind deur die  begrotingsproses,
maar uiteindelik onderworpe aan die Minister van Finansies, wat  die  finale
sÃª het. Die gewone burgers se seggenskap oor  die  begroting  verdwyn  sodra
hulle in 'n algemene verkiesing gestem het. Selfs verkose  verteenwoordigers
het nie die vermoÃ« om te verander aan die begroting wat voorgelÃª word nie.

Dinsdag,  egter,   het   die   Parlement   se   gesamentlike   beleidmakende
ReÃ«lskomitee 'n besluit geneem wat hierdie posisie  kan  verander.  'n  Nuwe
rol vir die Parlement is in  die  begrotingsproses  voorgestel.  Terwyl  die
Parlement nie die uitvoerende  gesag  se  rol  kan  oorneem  nie,  stel  die
komitee voor dat die Parlement invloed moet hÃª gedurende  die  tyd  wat  die
begroting ontwikkel word. Dit vul die Parlement  se  verpligte  oorsigtelike
rol  aan,  wat  in  elk  geval  behels  dat  daarop  gelet  word   dat   die
belastingbetalers waarde vir geld moet kry.  Hierdie  aanbevelings  sal  nog
die debatsprosedure van beide Huise moet deurstaan.

Ons kan ook verstaan dat die Tesourie maniere soek om seker te maak dat  die
geld wat aan departemente, provinsies  en  plaaslike  regering  gegee  word,
gespandeer word op dÃ­t waarvoor dit geoormerk is.  Dit  sal  nie  gebeur  as
slegs 149 uit die 284 munisipaliteite, soos in  Maart  verlede  jaar,  beide
finansiÃ«le kontrole en rekenkundige beleid in plek gehad het nie.

Die  Ouditeur-generaal  het  in  sy  oorsig  ook  pertinent  verwys  na  die
betalingsgebreke van munisipaliteite en  staatsdepartemente.  Die  feit  dat
munisipaliteite ook nie daarin slaag om hulle eie inkomstes te versamel  nie
en  reeds  R24  miljard  aan  agterstallige  skulde  op  hulle  boeke   het,
onderstreep die noodsaaklikheid van beter finansiÃ«le kontrole.

In hierdie wetsontwerp sowel as in die  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill
sien ons tekens van hierdie kontrole, soos die weerhouding van  fondse  deur
die    Tesourie    indien    munisipaliteite    nie    voldoen    aan    die
uitbreidingsvoorwaardes nie.

Terwyl die DA glo dat optrede nodig is, is ons bekommerd oor  die  feit  dat
die Regering die Grondwet verander om 'n mate van beheer  oor  die  uitgawes
van munisipaliteite te bekom. Dit verander die magsbalans  tussen  die  drie
sfere.  Die  Grondwet  het  'n   spesifieke   keuse   uitgeoefen   met   die
onafhanklikheid van die drie sfere. Ons glo nie dat die antwoord op  interne
politieke probleme verkry moet word deur verandering  aan  die  Grondwet  of
groter sentralisering nie.

Die probleem moet by sy wortels aangespreek word en die probleem lÃª  nie  by
derdevlakregering per se nie: dit lÃª  dikwels  by  ANC-aanstellings.  Hierna
word pertinent verwys in die wetsontwerp: die  feit  dat  beduidende  bedrae
spandeer is om kapasiteit te bou op plaaslike regeringsvlak,  maar  dat  dit
weinig - dit is die wetsontwerp se woorde - indien enige sukses behaal  het.
Kapasiteitsbou-  en  herstruktureringstoelaes  word  verdubbel,   van   R498
miljoen in 2002-2003 tot R995 miljoen in  2005-06.  Dit  is  'n  aansienlike
bedrag.

Kaderherontplooiing is 'n groot deel van hierdie  probleem.  Ek  het  gesien
hoe uiters bekwame mense in die Noord Vrystaat vervang word  deur  politieke
aanstellings  van  mense  wat  doodeenvoudig  nie  gehaltewerk   doen   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ja, terwyl daar  ander  beskikbaar  was.  Ek  het  dit  so
gesien en sal dit vir jou so wys, mnr  Sulliman.  Gevolglik  het  munisipale
dienslewering gely, terwyl onbenutte personeel nietemin met  volle  betaling
in diens van die munisipaliteite gebly het.

Dit bring ons weer by die kwessie van prioriteite. Die DA  is  bly  oor  die
addisionele bedrae wat bewillig is om die sosiale nood te  verlig  en  steun
wel die wetsontwerp, maar ons wil nou sien dat dit  die  behoeftiges  bereik
... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Everyone is familiar with the fact that they  are  probably  going  to  pay
more for their cigarettes and drinks after budget  day,  but  not  with  the
full  impact  of  the  national  Budget.  It  contains  the  most  important
decisions that any parliament makes and affects almost every aspect  of  our
lives. It is here that the difference between political  parties  are  often
most visible, as policy differences find expression in budget priorities.

In many respects it does not differ much from a household  budget.  If  your
expenditure exceeds your income, you land in debt and  you  have  to  borrow
money to maintain  your  lifestyle,  which  means  that  you  pay  interest.
Choices are made between a new  vehicle  or  a  new  kitchen.  These  simple
principles also apply to the Government. Ultimately someone has to cough  up
and pay. In the case of the state, it  is  the  taxpayer  who  receives  the
bill.

The Division of Revenue Bill that is being discussed today contains  details
of  how  the  taxpayer's  money  is  being  divided  between  the   national
Government, the provinces and the  municipalities.  While  the  Constitution
provides an important autonomy to these three spheres  of  government,  they
are, however, inextricably linked to  the  budget  process,  but  ultimately
subject to the Minister of Finance, who has  the  final  say.  The  ordinary
citizen's say regarding the budget disappears as soon as they have voted  in
a general election. Even elected representatives do not have  the  power  to
change the budget that is submitted.

On Tuesday, however, Parliament's joint policy-making Rules  Committee  made
a decision that may change this position. A  new  role  for  Parliament  was
proposed in the budget process. While Parliament cannot take over  the  role
of the executive authority, the committee proposes  that  Parliament  should
have an influence during the time the budget is  developed.  It  complements
Parliament's compulsory oversight role, which in any event entails  that  it
should be seen to that taxpayers get value for money. These  recommendations
will still have to withstand the debating procedure of both Houses.

We can also understand that the Treasury is looking for ways to ensure  that
the money that is given to departments, provinces and  local  government  is
being spent on what it has been earmarked for. This will not happen if  only
149 out of the 284 municipalities - as  in  March  last  year  -  have  both
financial controls and an accounting policy in place.

In  his  oversight  the  Auditor-General  also   referred   pertinently   to
shortcomings  with  regard  to   payment   by   municipalities   and   state
departments. The fact that municipalities also fail  to  collect  their  own
income and already have R24 billion in  debts  in  arrears  on  their  books
underlines the necessity for better financial control.

In this Bill as well as in the Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill  we  see
signs of this  control,  like  the  withholding  of  funds  by  Treasury  if
municipalities do not comply with the conditions for expansion.

While the DA believes that action is necessary, we are concerned  about  the
fact that the Government is changing the Constitution to gain  a  degree  of
control over the expenditure of municipalities. This changes the balance  of
power between the three  spheres.  The  Constitution  exercised  a  specific
choice with regard to the independence of  the  three  spheres.  We  do  not
believe that the answer to internal political problems  should  be  achieved
by  means  of  changes  to  the  Constitution  or  a   greater   degree   of
centralisation.

The problem should be addressed at its roots  and  the  problem  is  not  at
third-level government as such; it often lies with  ANC  appointments.  This
is pertinently referred to in the Bill: the fact  that  significant  amounts
were spent to build capacity at the local government level, but that it  has
achieved little - these are the words used in the Bill -  if  any,  success.
Capacity-building and restructuring grants  are  being  doubled,  from  R498
million in 2002-2003 to R995 million in  2005-2006.  It  is  a  considerable
amount.

Redeployment of cadres is a major part of this  problem.  I  have  seen  how
extremely competent people in the  Northern  Free  State  were  replaced  by
political appointments  of  people  who  simply  do  not  do  quality  work.
[Interjections.] Yes, while others were available. I have seen  it  as  such
and I will show it to you like that,  Mr  Sulliman.  Consequently  municipal
service delivery suffered, while unutilised staff  nonetheless  remained  in
the service of municipalities with full pay.

This once again brings us to the matter of priorities. The DA is glad  about
the additional amounts that were appropriated to relieve the  social  plight
and in fact supports the Bill, but we now want to see that  it  reaches  the
indigent ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Sorry, hon member. Yes,  hon  Lubidla,
are you rising on a point of order?

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, will the hon Botha take a question?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Will you take a question, hon Botha?

Ms C BOTHA: No, Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Okay. Will you  please  continue,  hon
Botha.
Ms C BOTHA: Dit bring ons weer by die kwessie van  prioriteite.  Die  DA  is
bly oor die addisionele bedrae wat  bewillig  is  om  die  sosiale  nood  te
verlig en steun dus ook hierdie wetsontwerp, maar ons wil nou sien  dat  dit
die behoeftiges bereik. Om dit te verseker,  moet  effektiewe  dienslewering
nie  onderhewig  wees  aan  die  bou  van  politieke   "empires"   nie.   As
transformasie of "preferential procurement" dienslewering in die  wiele  ry,
moet dit op 'n ander manier aangepak word.

Daar  is   geen   regverdiging   daarvoor   om   mense   sonder   kapasiteit
verantwoordelik te maak vir die besteding  van  fondse  -  soos  byvoorbeeld
skoolvoeding, wat vir werklik behoeftiges bedoel is nie - wat  dan  nie,  as
gevolg van hierdie aanstellings  nie  by  hulle  uitkom  nie.  Baie  dankie.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: This once again brings us to the matter of priorities.  The  DA
is very glad about the additional amounts that were appropriated to  relieve
the social plight, and therefore also supports this Bill, but  we  now  want
to see that it reaches the  indigent.  To  ensure  this,  effective  service
delivery should not be subject to the  building  of  political  empires.  If
transformation or preferential procurement  prevents  service  delivery,  it
has to be done in another manner.

There is no justification for making  people  without  capacity  responsible
for the expenditure of funds - like for  example  school  feeding,  that  is
meant for the truly indigent - which do not, because of these  appointments,
reach them. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I now call hon Fubbs,  chairperson  of
the standing committee on finance in Gauteng.

Ms J M L FUBBS (Gauteng): Thank you, hon Deputy  Chair  of  Committees,  for
the opportunity to address the House on the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  on
behalf of the Gauteng provincial government.

Hon Deputy Chairperson of Committees, hon members and colleagues, for us  in
Gauteng the division of revenue is the  celebration  of  our  constitutional
principles. It is the  celebration  of  co-operative  governance  and  human
rights, and is reflected in principles of equity,  human  dignity,  housing,
health care, food, water, social security and education.

The division of  revenue  is  also  the  celebration  of  the  principle  of
accountability and transparency,  introduced  during  the  new  dispensation
that  came  about  with  democracy  in  1994.  The  equitable   shares   and
allocations of revenue in the Constitution, section 214(1) - later  detailed
in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act - provides  for,  among  other
issues, the sharing of revenue in a manner that takes  care  or  account  of
regional disparities. This is enhanced within the framework of  co-operative
governance and, most importantly, recognises  the  unitary  state  of  South
Africa while acknowledging the  fiscal  decentralisation  of  responsibility
and effective delivery.

The increase in the provincial share of revenue releases further  funds  for
social development and does not, as my hon colleague from the DA  indicated,
provide funds only for emergencies in this area.  Rather,  these  funds  are
released for  a  sustainable  approach  to  developmental  social  services.
[Interjections.]

With regard to education, may I say that in Gauteng  we  have  a  burgeoning
population of learners. Currently, we are looking at  300Â 000  learners  per
year. Certainly, the  NPNC  will  help  Gauteng  meet  its  target  in  this
direction. This target is an 81% matric pass rate in 2003 - the end of  this
year.

The release of  extra  funds  to  provinces  has  also  enabled  Gauteng  to
prioritise  expenditure  towards  infrastructure  development,  which   will
enhance service delivery. It has enabled  us  to  increase  allocations  for
health and education. Currently, we are looking at 32% within  the  province
for education, 30% for health, 17% for social services.

Other factors which, perhaps, are important, and  which  my  hon  colleagues
and members may not be too aware of, is that in Gauteng we have  moved  from
101Â 000 beneficiaries to 256Â 000 beneficiaries this year.  We  project  this
upwards in 2004 to 320Â 000. Only the  broader  increases  in  social  grants
have facilitated this, and hardly the emergency relief.

With respect to the increase in the provincial share of revenue, we  believe
that the division  of  revenue  harnesses  our  revenue  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty and that it harmonises the division in such a way  that
it enables provinces to more effectively deliver services this year. It  has
extended the social net to support the  most  vulnerable,  including  women,
children and the youth. This has also more effectively tackled the issue  of
basic service delivery through local government. It continues to  prioritise
infrastructure,  accelerates  the  acquisition  of  skills  development  and
strengthens higher education. Indeed,  Gauteng  welcomes  this  last  point,
given the significant  shift  in  our  province  from  primary  to  tertiary
industries.
On a broader  level,  the  support  for  peace  and  development  operations
through Nepad  is  also  welcomed  as  Gauteng's  economic  development  and
stability, as other provinces recognise, are also linked to regional  peace,
economic development and stability. We, also, indeed recognise,  unlike  the
United States, that we are not silos of  sufficiency,  but  rather  that  we
need our neighbours if we are all going to develop  economically  much  more
and faster than we did in the previous century.

Furthermore, the division of revenue recognises the importance of  capacity.
We see this in the increase to provincial  and  local  government  from  the
National Treasury, and this will enable us to accelerate delivery.  However,
one thing is clear: There needs to be a great complementarity of  programmes
among the three spheres of government and  a  focus  on  implementation  and
execution of policy through delivery.

Gauteng  is  currently  using  capital  expenditure   more   and   more   to
strategically grow the  economy  and,  in  this  way,  reduce  poverty.  The
identification of revenue  gaps  and  the  continued  robust  collection  of
taxes, as well as savings on the debt costs, have contributed  significantly
to increased revenue available from the  national  fiscus  or  the  national
pool. I think that we ought to commend Sars in  this  respect  and,  indeed,
the National Treasury for the management of our debt.

Gauteng supports the approach to use  the  equitable  share  for  the  major
revenue resource to fund measures to address the scourge of HIV/Aids,  while
at the same time we welcome the decision to fund the treatment  for  mother-
to-child transmission of Aids,  home-based  care  and  awareness  programmes
through conditional grants.

This is informed by our understanding  that  HIV/Aids  cuts  across  health,
education, social services,  housing,  finance  and  economic  affairs,  and
labour, among other things. Thus, to  isolate  the  funding  would  minimise
rather than optimise the use  of  financial  resources.  In  this  way,  all
departments, we  believe,  in  Gauteng  are  responsible  for  factoring  in
measures to address Aids and to do so during microprioritisation.

Once again, it is this principle of  complementarity  and  harmonisation  of
efforts,  which  Gauteng  believes  will  underpin   integrated   allocative
efficiency  and  effective  expenditure  of   financial   resources   in   a
sustainable manner.

We  believe  that  allocative  efficiency  has   two   preconditions.   Most
importantly, the first one is to choose the right goods  and  services.  The
second one is that resources should be allocated to the activities that  are
most efficient at achieving the goals we have set.

Gauteng has also learnt the hard way that  earmarked  grants  can  sometimes
lead to underexpenditure. For example, in housing the grants  could  not  be
used due to a number of challenges, including capacity  at  a  local  level,
delays in environmental assessment and rezoning.

Gauteng also recognises the fundamental  difference  between  equitable  and
conditional grants, with the former  recognising  the  relative  demands  of
provinces and contextualising provincial circumstances, whereas  conditional
grants, as welcome as they  may  be  in  certain  circumstances,  are  ring-
fenced, though an equitable share of such funds could have been  effectively
utilised in other programmes by employing disciplined  shifts  within  Votes
or between Votes.

In respect of the proposed national grants  agency,  Gauteng  believes  that
sound institutional arrangements should  be  established,  and  that  robust
mechanisms  should  be  developed  to  underpin  efficient   and   effective
implementation.  The  increase  in  the  housing  subsidy  will  effectively
address Gauteng's focus  on  quality  housing  and  will  also  address  the
increasing costs of building houses.

Gauteng shares the concerns raised during the hearings on the provisions  to
align programmatic expenditure and conditional grant planning and  budgeting
across the three spheres of government. This is particularly  relevant  with
regard to the goal to maximise quality service delivery  through  integrated
delivery.

The timing of the publication of the IGFR addresses the concerns  raised  by
several legislatures who wish to use the  information  captured  therein  to
assist in the oversight of the respective current budgets.

This, I can tell you, hon Minister, is going  to  provide  Gauteng  with  an
invaluable  resource  instrument  for  its  portfolio  committees  and  will
effectively encourage improved oversight. This, in turn, will contribute  to
more effective quality service delivery.

Hon Chairperson, in respect of the grants we are getting,  may  I  tell  you
that Gauteng is not only building classrooms  and  clinics  -  though  these
are, indeed, important - but what we are also doing is saying that it is  of
no value to build a  classroom  unless  the  quality  of  education  can  be
improved, which we are now focused on.  Gauteng  rises  in  support  of  the
Division of Revenue Bill of 2003. Thank you, hon Chair. [Applause.]

Mr J F AULSEBROOK (KwaZulu-Natal): Mr Chairman, in  the  past  KwaZulu-Natal
delegates engaged rather vigorously in the Select Committee on  Finance  and
in the debates of this House on the Division of Revenue Bill. This year  the
tenor of our participation may come across as far more subdued, but  I  must
say that we have approached the Division  of  Revenue  Bill  with  far  more
focus on the text of the Bill than the numbers in the schedules.

The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government  is  satisfied  that  its  equitable
share allocation, as reflected in the  2003-04  Division  of  Revenue  Bill,
reached the agreed target of 20,6% in the equitable share  formula.  It  was
initially agreed that the province's equitable  share  would  grow  by  0,2%
points each year in the period from 1999-2000 to 2003-04  -  that  is,  from
19,8% in 1999-2000 to 20,6% in 2003-04.  Therefore,  the  province  strongly
believes that equity has eventually been achieved.
However, the province is mindful of  the  fact  that  the  2001  census  may
disrupt this long-awaited equity.  For  example,  the  province's  equitable
share could be negatively affected if the census shows a  population  figure
that proves to be less than is currently  applied  in  the  equitable  share
formula, yet the socioeconomic challenges facing  the  province  remain  the
same and are even worsening.

In  KwaZulu-Natal  we  accept  that  the  division  of  revenue  process  is
maturing, with  most  issues  on  the  equitable  share  being  dealt  with,
certainly in the Minmec's budget council  and  other  technical  committees,
and in terms of the  horizontal  and  vertical  divisions  being  acceptably
equitable at  the  moment.  This  relative  contentment  shown  by  us,  and
certainly by most provinces here today, is partly due to  the  increases  in
the equitable share we  have  all  received,  and  has  been  made  possible
through increased tax collection by the SA Revenue  Service.  For  that,  we
compliment the commissioner and his team.

Having said that, I doubt if there is a single province, more  so  provinces
with  large  rural  populations,  that  is  not  feeling  the  pressures  of
increased social demands. What we must  acknowledge  is  that  the  national
fiscus will never be in a position to satisfy these growing demands. I  take
this opportunity to suggest to the Minister, and certainly this House,  that
we approach this challenge in a very different manner than we  have  in  the
past and that we be far more proactive.

Firstly, we need to  accept  that  creeping  poverty  is  a  reality.  As  a
compassionate Government, we can merely provide a degree of poverty  relief.
This is where we need to be proactive in finding solutions,  and  I  venture
to suggest that there is only one solution and  that  is  ensuring  economic
growth. The cycle of poverty can only be broken by economic expansion.  This
is a task that cannot be placed at the door of a single national Minister.

The national and provincial budgets must  reflect  this  focus  with  buy-in
from all sectors - public, private and labour - and with  the  understanding
of the population  as  a  whole.  The  latter  may  prove  to  be  the  most
difficult, considering the plight  they  find  themselves  in.  Furthermore,
this would have to be a long-term plan - five years or  more.  There  is  no
quick fix to this and we all accept that.

Whilst Sars has done us proud in recent years, there is a limit to how  much
can be raised from the economically active portion of our population  before
a level of taxation is reached that becomes  an  inhibiting  factor  in  the
economic growth of this country. The considered introduction  of  a  poverty
grant, which will no doubt alleviate extreme poverty, is  something  we  all
welcome, but in itself is not a solution  but  a  mere  alleviation  of  the
problem.

If we do not take drastic measures soon it  won't  be  long  before  members
come before this House to consider the Division of Revenue  Bill  not  being
as content as they appear to  be  today.  They  will,  in  fact,  bring  the
pressures from their constituencies with them to this House.

I now turn to another issue, which is of concern and  which  is  highlighted
in this Bill, and that is the lack of financial accountability displayed  by
municipalities, considering that they  now  have  a  considerably  increased
equitable share and also bearing in mind that this is only a  small  portion
of most of their revenue. Indicative of this  are  the  outstanding  amounts
owed in audit fees to the Office of the Auditor-General.

This Bill is  not  the  vehicle  for  addressing  the  financial  management
shortcomings of municipalities, and the sooner we,  as  a  House,  pass  the
Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill,  the  sooner  this
problem will begin to abate.  Certainly,  we  agree  that  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill must  continue  to  reflect  grants  to  local  government  for
capacity-building as part of the solution.

In  conclusion,  we  in  KwaZulu-Natal  are  of   the   opinion   that   the
intergovernmental fiscal system has  matured.  In  addition,  there  are  no
policy differences between national and  provincial  governments.  In  fact,
national and provincial policy priorities, which underpin the allocation  of
resources, are closely aligned.  As  a  result,  the  provincial  government
believes that the time is now right for the national Government  to  release
control and give provinces greater accountability. This can be  achieved  by
phasing out conditional grants and making them part of the  equitable  share
allocation.

It is my pleasure on behalf of the province  to  support  this  Bill.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Deputy Chair of Committees, Minister of Finance, MEC  from  the
Eastern Cape and special delegates, if the Chair would allow  me,  I'd  like
to be out of order for about two  seconds.  You  know  how  disciplined  and
quiet I am in the House. [Interjections.] I  am  very  disciplined.  I  just
want to raise a small point.

In 2000, whilst I was in the provincial legislature of  the  Free  State,  I
chaired an ad hoc committee investigating  the  conditions  with  regard  to
farmworkers. We dealt with a whole range of things,  wages  and  so  on,  as
part and parcel of our terms of reference. We  also  went  to  the  northern
Free State, which my colleague referred to here. This colleague  here  is  a
farmer in that area. One of the submissions  made  was  that  the  party  on
whose behalf she was speaking was  using  coercive  measures  in  recruiting
farmworkers. [Interjections.]

Many issues were raised by some of the workers from that area that came  out
in this regard. I don't want to share with the House  the  outcomes  of  the
investigations for now, but I do want to raise the fact that, I think,  from
time to time, the member here does  create  the  impression  that  they  are
spokepersons for the poor. That is where my  problem  lies.  I  do  want  to
share further  with  the  House  the  kind  of  findings  we  made  as  that
committee. I just wanted to raise this part for now.

I do want to focus on the issues of the Free State as far as the  Budget  is
concerned. Since its inception, the child support grant has  had  about  115
000 beneficiaricies. The 2003-04 social development budget  of  R2,4Â billion
stands in stark contrast to the 1995-96 allocation of R827,8 million,  which
reflected the remnants of the previous system based on the legacy  of  years
of inequality.

In February 1995 social pensions, in total,  reached  148Â 000  beneficiaries
in the Free State. This total included the aged, war  veterans,  the  blind,
the disabled and those qualifying for family allowances. In February 2003  a
total of 281Â 820 people received Government  grants,  and  115Â 986  children
received child support grants.

Dear members of this august House, we, therefore, cannot apologise  for  our
bias in our spending pattern. In this light, social  development  will  take
up 21,1% of the Free State's provincial budget. This will increase to  24,7%
at the end of the medium-term expenditure period.

Social development is thus now a larger Vote than health  in  terms  of  the
relative size of its budget, and now becomes the second  largest  department
in this province after education. This allocation  serves  as  testimony  to
this Government's seriousness in alleviating the plight  of  the  poor,  the
disabled, the vulnerable and the elderly.

Clearly, any suggestion, from whichever quarter,  that  this  Government  is
not bent on serving the needs of the poor is nothing but  cheap  propaganda,
and can only come from those who have no desire or intention  whatsoever  to
respect  the  truth  or  meaningfully  engage  with  empirical  facts.  Such
political dinosaurs, driven by their own narrow interests to discredit  this
Government, even at the cost of totally disregarding the facts  and  denying
that progress is greatest when the lives of  ordinary  people  are  changed,
should best  be  handed  over  with  a  shudder  to  specialists  in  mental
diseases.

With regard  to  health,  the  provincial  budget  will  take  up  22,4%  of
provincial resources in the new financial year, and education will  take  up
15,8% of the provincial budget.

I wish to remind my  colleagues  and  friends  in  this  House  and  in  our
legislatures that in the  previous  political  regime  provinces  were  mere
spending agencies for national government, distributing funds  according  to
the policies and priorities determined  at  national  level.  In  the  past,
provinces were  no  different  from  national  departments  with  regard  to
budgets.

However, my colleagues and friends do know that currently provinces  are  in
a position to determine their own provincial budgets according to their  own
regional, social and economic priorities within the national  framework.  Of
course, this flexibility is limited to the  provincial  equitable  share  of
nationally raised revenue  and  provincial  own  revenue  collections.  This
flexibility does not extend to conditional grants.

In this light, I appeal to my  colleagues  and  friends  in  the  provincial
legislatures and in the National Council of Provinces to play a more  active
and vital role in  monitoring  spending  by  provincial  departments.  If  a
discrepancy exists in provincial financial reporting, it is likely  that  it
will be revealed on delivery  as  well.  Moreover,  MPLs  and  NCOP  members
should exercise extraordinary vigilance in order  to  monitor  the  spending
patterns of conditional grants to provincial departments.

We should raise the following questions? To what extend does the budget  and
the resources allocation it describes reflect policy decisions taken by  the
province, department or country as a whole? To what  extent  does  financial
input produce the desired output and outcomes?

We should also raise the question of whether provinces received an  increase
or decrease  in  total  allocation.  Did  they  incur  roll-overs  from  the
previous year? What is the position  in  this  regard?  What  percentage  of
provincial allocations are conditional  grants?  What  proportion  of  total
revenue  comprises  own  revenue?  Are  provinces  collecting  and  spending
revenue effectively and efficiently? Are  provinces  instituting  provincial
taxes?  Have  provinces  allocated  an  additional  amount  for  contingency
reserves, and how will they be utilised in the  new  financial  year?  These
are some of the questions members could raise.

With these few remarks, the Free  State  votes  in  favour  of  the  amended
Division of Revenue Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Thank  you.  I  now  call  upon  Cllr
Mvoko, the mayor of Cacadu District Municipality.

Cllr M MVOKO (Salga): Chair, it's pronounced "Cacadu". Mr Minister, the  MEC
from the  Eastern  Cape,  equitable  share  provides  a  good  indicator  of
Government support to municipalities in delivering basic  services  to  poor
households.

In 2003 such transfers constitute 17% of total Government revenue, with  the
remainder coming from  own  municipal  revenue.  This  should  be  put  into
context to indicate that urban  municipalities  raise  a  large  portion  of
their revenue - estimated at round 98% in 2002 - and there  are  signs  that
this trend is continuing. This extends to the fact that  income  in  smaller
and rural or poorer municipalities is derived mainly from transfers.

The variation noted above should be viewed  not  only  in  terms  of  fiscal
capacity  and  disparities  in  municipalities,  but  also  in  terms  of  a
reflection  of   limited   institutional   capacity   that   emanates   from
insufficient planning and implementation of IDPs and budgets. There  has  to
be some correlation between allocations or  transfers  and  output.  Current
municipal budget roll-overs  and  increases  in  municipal  debt  cannot  be
reconciled with this notion.

Estimates of infrastructure backlogs in local government remain  a  concern,
at approximately R52 billion. This calls for a greater  need  to  strengthen
transfers in line with revised powers and functions, and for a departure  by
the provincial sphere from practices which may hamper  better  planning  and
implementation at municipal level. The 2003 Budget  has  built  upon  these,
but there is a need for more improvement so that this status  is  maintained
and reinforced in the MTEF to achieve  the  object  of  promoting  long-term
planning and predictability.

National transfers to local government  increased  at  an  average  rate  of
18,4% from R8,8 billion in the previous financial  year's  budget  to  R14,6
billion in  2005-06.  Against  the  background  that  approximately  90%  of
municipalities finance their budgets from own revenue, this figure thus  has
a limited yield.

The provision of free  basic  services  remains  a  key  priority  of  local
government. As an unconditional transfer to municipalities, equitable  share
is directed at improving basic service delivery such as water,  electricity,
sanitation and refuse. It appropriately favours  poorer  municipalities.  It
is anticipated that the review of the equitable share will rationalise  data
that inform this process.

Approximately 38% of the equitable share is distributed to  the  30  largest
municipalities  according  to   the   size   of   their   budgets,   serving
approximately 49% of the poor. We, however, need to  begin  looking  at  how
targeted the equitable share is in reaching the  intended  group,  which  is
the poor households. Furthermore, we believe that a better understanding  of
municipal fiscal environment conditions would promote even better focus  and
targeting of transfers by municipalities.

The equitable share will rise from 45% in 2002-03 to 53% in 2005-06,  giving
an increase of R3,9 billion  to  R6,3  billion.  The  allocation  is  to  be
supplemented with a R1,4 billion allocation for free electricity and a  R2,7
billion allocation for free basic water, sanitation and refuse, but we  need
to strengthen the sanitation and refuse provision.

Infrastructure transfers are  geared  especially  towards  addressing  basic
infrastructure services  to  poor  households  and  towards  being  directed
towards providing job creation  through  labour-intensive  mechanisms.  Once
more, an assessment  of  how  funds  eventually  drive  employment  creation
should be done to establish whether the object  of  the  grant  is  actually
achieved.
Capacity-building grants are predominantly focused on larger  municipalities
or on supporting municipalities experiencing severe  financial  problems  as
well as other parameters. Given this and  the  aforementioned  institutional
limitations,  there  needs  to  be  a  parallel   process   that   addresses
institutional capacity to develop plans and implement IDPs and budgets.

The 2003 Budget initiated the review of the equitable share to some  extent.
The formula for the division of revenue between municipalities is  based  on
the principle of equity and predictability. It is therefore critical that  a
review of the equitable share formula is premised on this principle.

For instance,  the  hyphotheses  that  are  in  the  current  formula  under
"Institutional Grant I" could be tested. For example, is there  evidence  to
support the assumption that a rise in population has been accompanied  by  a
drop in "Institutional Grant I"  per  capita?  Clearly,  a  revisit  of  the
formula should not be limited only to data on household  poverty  variables,
but should  also  cover  broader  aspects  which  impact  on  the  principle
advanced in the argument for equitable share.

Section 5(2) of the  Division  of  Revenue  Act  of  2002  on  criteria  for
determining the division clearly outlined the  need  for  consultation  with
Salga, taking into account the fiscal capacity of each municipality  with  a
view to prioritising funding for service  delivery.  The  omission  of  this
provision in the current Bill is noted, and we believe that it is  unfounded
at this point.

Section 5(5) of the 2002 Act dealt with transfers to  municipalities,  being
determined  by  the  national  accounting  officer  responsible  for   local
government after consultation with the National Treasury. This has not  been
included in the 2003 Bill, and it is proposed  that  it  be  considered  and
added to limit any misunderstanding of levels of accountability in terms  of
the disbursement of funds.

In terms of section 5(6) of the current  Bill,  the  National  Treasury  may
delay or withhold the transfer of  an  instalment  on  the  grounds  that  a
municipality  experiences  serious  or  persistent  breach  of  the  uniform
Treasury norms and standards determined to ensure  that  the  municipality's
budget  complies  with  the  measures  to  ensure  both   transparency   and
expenditure control.

This aspect raises concerns as it is not in accordance with  section  216(2)
of  the  Constitution.  Moreover,  not  only  has  a  generally   recognised
accounting practice not been introduced by  national  legislation,  but  the
provisions of section 216 have also been ignored. There is obviously a  need
to consult and, where appropriate,  reach  consensus.  What  this  provision
entails is outside co-operative governance principles, and  it  impedes  the
constitutional obligations of municipalities.

It is therefore proposed that  the  recently  amended  section  139  of  the
Constitution be applied in this regard, and that the current  provisions  be
deleted or brought into line with the substance as contained in the  amended
section 139.

The new provisions which compel municipalities to  report  to  the  National
Treasury by no later that 30 June  2003  and  to  certify  to  the  National
Treasury that an entity complies as an external mechanism,  as  contemplated
in chapter 8 of the Local Government:  Municipal  Systems  Act,  is  not  in
accordance with section 151 of the Constitution. This  section  states  that
the executive and legislative authority is vested in the municipal council.

If some form of certifying compliance in this regard is  necessary,  let  it
be done through the Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  until
there is clear legislation that  directs  municipal  entities,  because  the
legislation that deals with this provision sits with that  department.  What
is proposed in the Bill could limit the municipality's  ability  to  deliver
services through external mechanisms.

There is concern with regards to the  conditionality  of  these  conditional
grants. Essentially, these conditions are not only varied  but,  in  certain
areas, request municipalities to furnish information  that  is  not  readily
available or which demands that certain infrastructure  requirements  be  in
place. There is therefore a need to bring these conditions into  line  in  a
manner that does not limit municipalities from obtaining these grants,  but,
rather, that they have systems that address qualifying requirements so  that
some of the grants are accessible, especially those that impact directly  on
service delivery to poor municipalities.

Considerations of financial viability, revenue collection,  budget  roll-out
and funding to support the extension  of  services  to  underserviced  areas
should constitute the overall basis for  developing  formulae  and  ensuring
that all targeted  municipalities  do,  in  fact,  benefit  from  transfers.
Equitable share should  facilitate  the  shift  in  resources  towards  poor
municipalities. The next budget cycle therefore needs to indicate that  this
shift is not just achieved, but that  it  is  spread  across  municipalities
which do not have revenue-raising capacity.
There is further concern with regard to  the  constitutional  definition  of
basic services. The current studies will guide  us  in  determining  whether
certain provincial functions need to be assigned to municipalities.

Grants directed towards capital  projects  should  be  interfaced  with  the
overall system of intergovernmental transfers to municipalities. This  would
ensure greater discretion in the use of funds to enhance the  sustainability
of assets and encourage buy-in and better implementation.

Given the limited institutional capacity in some municipalities to plan  and
implement IDPs and budgets, there should be  a  conscious  effort  to  build
capacity to achieve better service  delivery  to  our  communities.  Equally
important is the capacity drive that will impact on the ability  to  monitor
service delivery agreements and ensuring that service  providers  carry  out
their obligations.

There is an urgent need to develop policy guidelines that deal with  matters
relating  to  the  indigent.  Until  there  is  a  framework   that   guides
municipalities  on  this  issue,  there  will  remain   differentiation   in
allocations, which do  not  particularly  ensure  a  transparent  system  of
allocation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms S SITHOLE (Northern Province): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of  Finance,
thank you for the opportunity to address  this  House.  The  purpose  of  my
coming here is to do exactly what my province sent me to do, namely  address
three things.

The first is to support the amended  version  of  the  Division  of  Revenue
Bill. The second is to ask the Minister of Finance to act very quickly  with
regard to the Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill.  The
third thing is to ask the Minister of Finance to have a second look  at  the
allocation to Limpopo as far as welfare is concerned  as  the  province  has
spent more than 100% of its allocation. This gives us  the  impression  that
something is quite abnormal. We believe that this  is  because  many  people
spend their active years  in  other  places  and  come  home  to  retire  in
Limpopo, and the fact that we have the  neighbouring  states  of  Mozambique
and Zimbabwe. Those are the three things that I have come here to address.

Perhaps it is important for me to make this Council understand the  dynamics
of the province from which I come. I come from a province  where  about  95%
of the population was black and where it is not by accident  that  there  is
underdevelopment as it was the design of the previous  regime.  So,  I  come
from that type of province. I also come  from  a  province  where  there  is
poverty and where more than 50% of the population are  rural  women,  and  I
represent that constituency.

I  say  this  so  that  you  can  understand  that  we  do  not   have   the
sophistication that other provinces may have. We are not so literate  as  to
be able to read newspapers, and perhaps we cannot even  afford  televisions.
Our only bible in life is the Freedom Charter. We are guided by "The  people
shall govern", and "Power to the people".

I come from a province where, in order for people at grass roots  to  listen
to you, you have to tell them where you found your information  and  whether
you're quoting former  President  Mandela,  President  Thabo  Mbeki  or  the
Minister of Finance, Trevor Manuel. Otherwise,  you  will  be  wasting  your
time; people won't listen to you.

In order that I don't risk not being listened to, I'll do  exactly  that:  I
will quote from what the president of the ANC said in an address on  January
8:


  We must use the state Budget to improve the quality of life of especially
  the poor, while contributing to the expansion of the economy. Among other
  things, we must ensure the  proper  functioning  of  our  social  welfare
  system and effective use of poverty alleviation funds.

He went further to say that:


  Relying on the improved system of accountability for our members deployed
  in Government, we must also  ensure  that  our  members  discharge  their
  responsibilities  with  regard  to  the  functioning  of  the  system  of
  governance. Through this, we must ensure that members of the ANC deployed
  in Government treat this issue as a priority matter.

I would also like to quote my favourite Minister, Trevor Manuel,  who  said:
"Those who do not embrace the spirit of  Batho  Pele  should  do  the  right
thing and leave the  Public  Service."  We  in  this  House,  in  provincial
legislatures,  are  charged  with  ensuring  that  the  funds  we  vote   to
departmental  programmes  and  Government  agencies  are   responsibly   and
effectively employed. There can be no delivery  without  accountability  and
no accountability without oversight.

By this, I am trying to say that if Government does  not  deliver,  it  will
not be the administration, the executive councils or the Cabinet that is  to
blame. The buck stops with us. It will mean that as hon members we  did  not
play our oversight role. We must understand that it  is  the  responsibility
of the legislatures, the NCOP and Parliament to keep Government  accountable
to the people of South Africa.

The main role of a plenary is to provide  a  forum  for  public  debate  and
decision-making. The  most  important  role  of  committees  is  to  develop
expertise to gather information and  to  do  the  detailed  work  that  must
underpin properly informed decisions about public policy.

The role of the finance committee is to scrutinise physical  aggregates  and
not sectoral budgets. Therefore, there also need to be formal  co-ordination
mechanisms between finance and other sectoral  committees.  To  quote  Tania
Ajam:


  The introduction of the Public Finance Management Act,  together  with  a
  host of other financial and budget reforms  in  the  public  sector,  has
  necessitated that  members  of  Parliament  and  provincial  legislatures
  acquire a broad  range  of  oversight  skills.  In  order  to  scrutinise
  budgetary allocations thoroughly, committee members need  information  on
  which to base their analysis and recommendations. The problem of lack  of
  information, in essence, is not one of nondisclosure, but rather a system
  problem of the information not being generated - unless  committees  have
  access to reliable and timely flow of information  throughout  the  year.
  Therefore,  without  ongoing  information  it  is  difficult  to  achieve
  effective oversight.

Finally, I would like to say that improving legislative oversight is  likely
to  be  a  slow  and  arduous  process.  Yet,  its  importance   cannot   be
overemphasised in ensuring that public expenditure generates  maximum  value
for money for all South African citizens. To do less in a society with  such
high levels of legitimate needs and  aspirations  and  such  tight  resource
constraints would be morally culpable.

Therefore, as the finance  committee  of  Limpopo,  we  have  put  in  place
strategies and mechanisms to make sure that every  department  accounts  for
the funds that have been allocated to it. That is why we  have  the  courage
to  actually  support  this  Bill.  We  have  put  in  place   systems   and
arrangements to ensure that,  on  an  ongoing  basis,  all  chief  financial
officers appear before the committee to give us reports - reports  that  are
informative and which are placed before the committee, written according  to
the Public Finance Management Act. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. I  call  the  hon  Ozinsky,
deputy chairperson  of  the  standing  committee  on  finance  and  economic
development, Western Cape.

Mr M OZINSKY (Western Cape): Hon Chair of Committees, hon Minister  and  hon
members, I want to thank my province and the ANC for giving  me  the  honour
of speaking in this House for the first time. [Applause.]

The last five days have seen terrible floods in  many  parts  of  the  rural
areas of the Western Cape, especially in the Boland, Overberg  and  Southern
Cape. We want to send our condolences  to  those  who  are  suffering  as  a
result of these floods,  and  especially  to  the  family  of  Vusi  Mxolisi
Njokeni from Dam-se-Bos in Knysna who died during the flooding.

Once again, these floods have shown that  those  who  suffer  the  most  are
black and poor, those who  suffered  under  apartheid  and  those  who  this
Budget must assist.

On behalf of the Western Cape, I want to say that we  are  pleased  that  in
this Bill the provincial share of the Budget  increases  by  0,8%  over  the
MTEF period, which in real terms is an increase  of  6,1%.  We  are  pleased
with this, not because we feel that  provinces  should  be  strengthened  in
relation  to  the  national  sphere,  but  because  we  believe   that   the
responsibilities  of  the  province  are  increasing  in  terms  of  service
delivery to the people.

Let me also say that the ruling co-operation in  the  Western  Cape  between
the ANC and the New NP, in contrast to the previous  DA  government,  agrees
with the  equitable  share  formula  used  to  divide  revenue  between  the
provinces.
I say this even though the equitable  share  of  my  province,  the  Western
Cape, has been declining and will probably decline further  in  the  current
MTEF period. In 1999 our share was 9,8% and in  2003-04  it  will  be  8,9%,
which amounts to a shift away of about R1,3 billion in 2003 rands.

We say this because our province does  not  exist  as  an  island  in  South
Africa. We  are  part  of  the  broader  South  Africa,  and  we  have  been
relatively privileged in  terms  of  resources  and  infrastructure  by  the
apartheid and colonial governments.

The poverty and lack of resources of our neighbouring provinces  put  strain
on our government delivery and  the  infrastructure  of  our  province.  For
instance, many people move backwards and forwards between the Western  Cape,
the Eastern Cape and the Northern Cape in search of  job  opportunities  and
services such as health care and education and, obviously,  to  visit  their
families. In some cases this puts an increased  burden  and  occasionally  a
strain on the resources of our province.  I  believe  this  has  often  been
overstated by those who want to claim a lack of progress in  overcoming  the
injustices of the past.

As our neighbouring provinces increase their infrastructure and  ability  to
deliver services to their  people  by  making  good  use  of  the  increased
allocation from the  equitable  share,  so  the  pressure  on  services  and
infrastructure in our province will be reduced. In  particular,  we  believe
that the new framework for the provision of  tertiary  care  in  the  health
sector, while initially causing some problems in our province, will, in  the
long term, take considerable pressure  off  the  health  facilities  of  our
province.

We are also thankful for the increase in  the  health  revitalisation  fund,
which will be used to improve the state of our hospitals  and  allow  us  to
accelerate the redistribution of  services  in  our  province  to  the  poor
areas, something which was long delayed under DA rule.

The reduced equitable share also has a positive effect on  service  delivery
in our province. It is forcing  every  department  and  every  programme  to
become more efficient and thrifty about how money is spent and  on  what  it
is spent.

Increasing fiscal discipline, effectiveness and efficiency in  spending  and
service delivery, and increasing capital expenditure are  now  part  of  the
policy priorities in the province.  I  am  also  pleased  to  say  that  our
province  is  now  aligning  its  policy  guidelines   with   the   national
Government's guidelines.

We also welcome the actual increase in the share of our province  of  12,38%
this year and 9,08%  next  year,  which  will  bring  the  increase  in  our
provincial expenditure closer to the CPIX. This will allow our  province  to
deal with many of the pressures on our budget, especially in  the  areas  of
social security growth, acceleration of social and  economic  infrastructure
and development, investment, service delivery, economic development and  job
creation. In particular, we want to thank the hon Minister for the  increase
in child support grants, pensions and  other  grants  which  will  help  the
poorest of the poor.

Lastly, let me say that there has been some concern raised in  our  province
around the timeframes in  which  local  governments  need  to  submit  their
accounts and statements to the Treasury.  Unfortunately,  there  remain  two
municipalities in our province which have still not submitted their  account
statements for 2001-02. They are Kannaland and  Witzenberg,  both  of  which
were controlled by the DA in the  years  in  question.  [Interjections.]  We
hope this Bill will increase the pressure on local governments to get  their
house in order.

On behalf of the Western Cape, we  give  our  support  to  this  Bill  as  a
mandate. [Applause.]

Mr T B TAABE: Hon  Deputy  Chair  of  Chairs,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,
special delegates and representatives from  Salga,  this  afternoon  we  are
debating the Division of Revenue  Bill,  2003-04,  which  provides,  in  the
main, for the  equitable  division  of  revenue  anticipated  to  be  raised
nationally and by the three spheres of government for the 2003-04  financial
year.

Whilst we consider the Division  of  Revenue  Bill  this  afternoon,  it  is
instructive that hon members in this august House are reminded of the  words
of one of the foremost thinkers in economic discipline, Adam Smith, who  had
this to say: "No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of  which  the
far greater part of the members are poor and miserable."

Like this giant, we, as members of this Council, must  also  echo  the  same
view that our society cannot be flourishing and happy, when the far  greater
part of the  members  are  poor  and  miserable.  Therefore,  the  challenge
confronting this our nation, which is before all of  us  without  exception,
is  not  only  poverty,  but  also  the  realisation  of  the  objective  of
eradicating it.

My province, Mpumalanga, receives R11,1Â billion  in  terms  of  the  2003-04
Division  of  Revenue  Bill.  The  amount  of  R911Â million,  which  is  our
provincial  share,  constitutes  conditional  grants,  with   the   balance,
therefore, attributed to the equitable share. In essence, we  receive  about
5,48% of the total conditional allocations to provinces. Conditional  grants
in Mpumalanga grew from R13,5 billion  in  the  2002-03  financial  year  to
R16,6 billion in the new financial year.

This growth is linked largely to the extension of the child support  grants,
as hon members would know. These grants constitute an important part of  the
intergovernmental transfer system as they provide  for  national  priorities
in provincial budgets; for  compensation  to  provinces  for  cross-boundary
flows and specialised services; and for support for transition and capacity-
building.

Our spending in Mpumalanga on social services has been gradually  increasing
as a share of total Government spending. In  the  previous  financial  year,
our spending stood at 70%  of  total  provincial  revenue.  Accordingly,  as
Mpumalanga, we intend to spend about 80% of our budget on  social  security.
It is our well-considered view that spending on education, health  care  and
social security will not only enhance capital formation,  but  also  promote
equity and effectively reduce poverty.

Strides have indeed been made  in  the  area  of  financial  management  and
control in Mpumalanga. Our resources are being efficiently managed, and  the
situation  in  this  regard,  which   existed   previously,   has   improved
remarkably. Departments and other statutory bodies have come to  the  party,
at least for the first time, precisely because the letter and spirit of  the
PMFA are being followed  and  implemented  fully.  We  argue  that  we  must
ourselves continue to deepen the budgetary  process  in  our  province.  The
critical  and  most  pressing  challenges  remain  the  enhancement  of  the
financial management capacity of  our  social  service  departments,  namely
health, social services and education.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, as  hon  members  in  this  House  this
afternoon would recall, will  be  released  in  April,  which  will  greatly
assist departments in our province  to  plan  properly.  This  must  ensure,
further, that the capacity of our province to direct its  limited  resources
to areas of priority is  enhanced.  This  must  also  ensure  that  our  own
elected  representatives,  gathered  here  this  afternoon,  are   able   to
effectively exercise their oversight role  and  function  in  a  responsible
way.

As hon members would know, our equitable share as a province for  the  2003-
04 financial year stands at R10,219 billion.  We  are  of  the  view,  as  a
province,  that  the  fact  that  we  have  this  money  should  deepen  our
commitment to changing the lives of all our people. Our  view,  in  relation
to this commitment, remains  one  that  is  firm,  unshakable  and,  indeed,
unquestionable, because we believe that with the limited  resources  at  our
disposal we have, indeed, made a difference to the most  vulnerable  in  our
communities, provided that we spend  the  funds  allocated  responsibly  and
effectively and ensure that they benefit those for whom they were intended.

A substantial chunk of our allocation as  Mpumalanga  will  fund  programmes
aimed at, inter alia, accelerating the provision  of  infrastructure,  which
was reinforced through the school building programme. As a province  we  are
also  stepping  up  the  provision  for   scholar   transport   and   school
infrastructure. Although  spending  on  infrastructure  has  improved,  much
remains to be done given the existing backlogs  in  infrastructure,  thereby
allowing us to continue our noble  and  sustained  fight  against  the  twin
evils of unemployment and poverty.

In conclusion, I think all of us must continue to  foster  an  understanding
amongst South Africans of all persuasions, indeed all patriots,  to  form  a
broad-based front for reconstruction and development. The long road we  have
travelled since 1994, we must admit, has not been  easy.  Sometimes  it  has
been very bumpy and, indeed, very rocky.

The words, again of Adam Smith, are as  instructive  and  relevant  to  this
very day as they truly were then: "No society can surely be flourishing  and
happy,  of  which  the  far  greater  part  of  the  members  are  poor  and
miserable." This continues to be the challenge.  I  thank  you,  hon  Deputy
Chair. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chair, may I express appreciation,  firstly,
to the select committee and then to all the contributors to this  debate.  I
think that both the report, as published in the ATC today, and the  bulk  of
contributions to the discussion here this afternoon indeed demonstrate  that
the  intergovernmental   fiscal   relations   system   has   matured   quite
considerably.

The evidence of the change, not only in the allocations,  but  also  in  the
management of the resource is there for  all  to  see.  Because  we've  been
consistent in the application of norms and  standards  in  intergovernmental
fiscal relations because the Budget Council has matured in the way  that  it
has, we have over the past few years been able to nuance the approaches.

The reference I made earlier  to  the  noncapital,  nonpersonnel  issues,  I
think, is part of the demonstration of that; but also,  whereas  we  had  to
ring-fence certain moneys for capital expenditures in health, education  and
transport a few years ago, now that the capacity is there we  have  to  roll
that out and continue rolling it  out.  And,  I  think,  that  distinguished
members of the NCOP who are mandated by  provinces,  as  virtually  all  the
contributors here have demonstrated today, would in fact  be  in  reflection
of that growing maturity. I'd  like  to  express  sincere  appreciation  for
that.

The point I'd like to make in response to the hon Sithole is  that  what  we
can't do in the Division of Revenue Bill is to  do  what  the  Bill  is  not
intended to do. We  said  earlier  that  every  sphere  of  government  must
allocate from its share to its needs. We cannot sit at  the  national  level
and increase the welfare grant to the Limpopo province, because  that  would
in fact undermine the fundamental responsibility of the  Limpopo  government
to undertake that. What we are doing, and what the Bill  does  provide  for,
is to ensure that there's a conditional grant to help us roll out the  child
support grant until we reach 14.

So that bit is ring-fenced. It doesn't need to be ring-fenced, but  we  need
to monitor it to ensure that providing for the  increasing  age  limits,  in
terms of the child support grant, doesn't flow over into the  rest.  Because
these kinds of social grants are statutory  commitments,  we  have  to  meet
them, and the provinces in meeting them sometimes have  to  shave  off  from
other responsibilities and that has created a contradiction in the past.

So the introduction of this element as a conditional grant is  one  that  we
must actually understand. Having said that, the detail of what we will  have
available from Census 2001 must help us understand these issues.

I think, in a not dissimilar way, because we aren't dealing with  a  perfect
position, the points raised by the hon Sithole about people who spend  their
working lives in one province and then retire to another province is  not  a
uniquely Limpopo issue. They go to provinces like Limpopo, the Eastern  Cape
and KwaZulu-Natal for retirement and  also  may  work  elsewhere  and  leave
children with gogo [grandmother] in those provinces, and that  creates  this
kind of contradiction. So we aren't dealing  with  perfection.  We  need  to
understand that, and I think the kind of discussion we're having  here  this
afternoon and the hearings in the committee over the  past  few  weeks  have
helped us understand that a bit better.

Similarly, I want to  make  the  appeal  again  that  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review, when it is available after 8 April, must be  used.  I'd  like
to believe that the fact that we're  publishing  so  close  to  recess  must
place us in a position in which the document is taken  for  discussion  into
every province. It must become a very important part of our political  work.


With regard to the comparisons between provinces, colleagues would  remember
that in previous years we  were  able  to  demonstrate  how,  in  fact,  the
distribution   of   medical   personnel   demonstrates   some    interesting
contradictions. The North West has the poorest distribution of  doctors  and
specialists out of all provinces. Why does that happen? How  do  we  address
those kinds of issues? How  does  that  impact  on  the  quality  of  health
services  rendered?  Can  we  meet  our  Batho  Pele  commitments  if  those
contradictions obtain?

That becomes the political message out of this  document  and  I  think,  as
with the child support grant and so on, these issues must be taken  forward.
I certainly heard that resonating through the contributions of a  number  of
contributors to the debate this afternoon.

Another view I heard is some concern about payments to the  Auditor-General.
Now, I should perhaps say that I take a less charitable line on this  issue.
If you run a spaza shop and  you  give  people  bread  and  you  don't  say:
``Please pay me for it'', you're not going to remain in business  for  long.
If you have a statutory power of undertaking an audit  and  you  don't  say:
``Pay me for this'' and use your statutory  power,  but  then  come  to  the
legislature and say, ``We don't know  how  to  run  a  business'',  I  think
you've got a problem.

So, rather than feel sympathy, I think all of us must hold hands and say  to
the Auditor-General: ``Run your  business  properly.  Please,  it's  in  the
interests of democracy that you do so.'' As we say that, we  must  also  say
to  local  authorities:  ``You,  individually  and  collectively,  have   an
obligation  to  settle,  because  you  can't  run  the  business  of   local
government and be accountable if you're not prepared to be audited  so  that
those who vote for you can see what you're doing right and wrong.''

I'd like to campaign for this position. I've said  to  the  Auditor-General,
and I've said to the Audit Commission, that I will not take a  dime  out  of
other people's money to give to the  Auditor-General  for  circumstances  in
which he has failed to collect what genuinely he should  collect.  I'd  like
to believe that we can in fact have consensus about that issue.

Let me turn to some of the contributions by the Mayor of Cacadu,  on  behalf
of Salga. Now, clearly we would want to provide a  more  detailed  response,
but I hope that the situation in respect of financial  management  in  local
government can  mature  to  the  same  extent  that  the  situation  in  the
provinces has matured. I think that anybody from the provinces would  concur
that the Public Finance Management Act has helped us  considerably.  And  so
the battle for the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill  will
help us to ensure that there is, firstly, a consistent  form  of  budgeting,
including a medium-term expenditure framework; and, secondly,  a  consistent
form of reporting. That, I think, would bring a lot of the local  government
financial management issues out  of  the  shadows  into  the  limelight  and
compel improvements.

Now, some issues have been raised about section  5(6)  of  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill. I need to remind the  distinguished  representative  of  Salga
that we've recently amended the Constitution to  ensure  that  for  material
and persistent breach - material and persistent breach - we  can,  in  fact,
take away the municipal functions. Now  it  has  to  be  a  big  step.  That
constitutional amendment, I think, would only be used  in  the  severest  of
circumstances. However, it is a big step and one that  has  been  introduced
as part of the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill  to
ensure that there can be no  doubt  about  the  accountability,  nor  should
there be any limitation on the ability of local government  to  be  able  to
borrow against its own revenue stream.

So it's an empowering feature of that legislation. The mayor did talk  about
section 216 and the powers that we have there, but I think  that  we  should
invite Salga to look again at  their  concern,  because  I'd  like  to  read
section 5(6). It says:


  Despite subsection (3) ...

Which deals with quarterly instalments and so on -


  ... the National Treasury  may,  after  consultation  with  the  national
  accounting officer responsible for local government...

In  other  words,  the  DG  for  the  Department  of  Provincial  and  Local
Government -


  ... delay or withhold the transfer of an instalment on the grounds  of  a
  municipality's serious or persistent material breach of uniform  treasury
  norms and standards.

That is, a serious or persistent material breach of uniform  Treasury  norms
and standards. Now, my pleading  to  the  distinguished  representatives  of
Salga is that we are able to draw a distinction  between  a  little  mistake
which, on the one hand, in the course of the maturing sphere of  Government,
we will encounter and must be able to deal with, support  and  mentor,  and,
on the other hand, what the section says:  serious  or  material  breach  of
uniform norms and standards. I don't think anybody who is a democrat  should
say that we will support those who don't give a damn and  don't  mind  being
in serious or material breach.

So I'd like to ask that those matters be considered by Salga again. I  will,
in the course of  the  next  period,  be  in  conversation  and  in  written
communication with the distinguished reverend,  His  Worship  the  Mayor  of
Tshwane, about this matter. But I think that we  must  use  these  kinds  of
instances to start building those platforms for maturity.

We are not in competition. We are  not  about  undermining  that  sphere  of
government which is, in many instances, the  coalface  of  what  our  people
experience every day. This is because when the provinces  aren't  there  and
when we in national Government aren't there, people  wake  up  and  see  the
filth around them, they see the streetlights that aren't working, they  turn
on their taps and there's no water - like  the  local  authority  in  Acacia
Park doesn't provide water and so on - then,  of  course,  people  are  very
angry with government and the government that they're angry  with  is  local
government. So I believe that we have a collective responsibility to  ensure
that local government can meet these objectives.

As we deal with those issues, the definitions of  what  basic  services  are
become clear, but let me also be blunt about the fact that I think  we  need
consistency. We need consistency about the  fact  that  the  Auditor-General
ought to collect what's due to the Auditor-General. We need  consistency  to
ensure that local authority collects what's due to local authority,  because
there are many instances in which  they  aren't  collecting.  So,  you  have
people melded together whose circumstances are desperate because they're  so
desperately poor, with businesses which  don't  bother  to  pay,  because  a
local authority doesn't get its  act  together  to  ensure  that  it  has  a
reasonable billing and collection system.

Now, the distinguished mayor did make reference to the point about a  policy
on indigence, and I want to echo that. I want to  ask  that  Salga  actually
don't wait for some directive, but that Salga demonstrate  some  leadership.
Optimally, I think the system would work in such a way  that  an  individual
goes to a local authority and registers the family as poor or indigent.  The
local authority must have the ability to investigate  the  circumstances  to
ensure that nobody who happens to be a member of Parliament  and  earning  a
salary like  we  do  registers.  This  is  so  that  people  who  are  truly
unemployed, who are really indigent, will be treated quite separately.

We will then have a national roster. Some  of  the  circumstances  would  be
temporary,  some  are  permanent,  but  unless  there's  action  from  local
authority, a number of other initiatives, I think, are  going  to  run  into
difficulty. This is because that same register should then be the basis  for
demonstrating a policy that we really care.

I think I've run out of time.

Whether it be through the distribution of food parcels or the  provision  of
services to people who aren't paying  because  they  can't  afford  to  pay,
that's what a caring democracy does. The frontline of that has to  be  local
authorities.  So  my  pleading  in  support  of  the  contributions  of  the
distinguished mayor of Cacadu is that Salga in fact  demonstrate  a  bit  of
leadership and bring the rest of Government  into  line  with  a  policy  on
indigence, which we must make work. I think that  that,  in  many  respects,
would be the acid test of our democracy.
For all of the contributions, once  again,  and  for  the  support  for  the
Division of Revenue Bill 2003, I thank all contributors. [Applause.]

                 FOOD RELIEF ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Deputy Chair,  the  Food  Relief  Adjustments  Appropriation
Bill is a money Bill. The objective of the Bill is  to  appropriate  amounts
of money for the requirements of the Department of  Social  Development  and
the Department of Foreign Affairs, in respect of the financial  year  ending
31 March 2003.

The following amounts are appropriated from the National  Revenue  Fund  for
the following national  departments:  an  amount  of  R230Â million  for  the
Department of Social Development, in respect of the  financial  year  ending
March this year,  to  fund  the  implementatiton  of  domestic  food  relief
interventions; and an amount of R170Â million for the Department  of  Foreign
Affairs, in respect of the financial year ending March this  year,  to  give
effect to South Africa's commitment to assisting in the  provision  of  food
relief to those countries in the SADC region more seriously affected by  the
food crisis.

The 2002 adjustments estimate set  aside  R400Â million  for  emergency  food
relief for vulnerable groups, including a contribution to the regional  food
relief programme as part of the revised expenditure  proposal.  This  amount
was not allocated to a particular department at the time of the  adjustments
budget,  because  the  relevant   departments   were   still   investigating
appropriate interventions through an interdepartmental technical committee.

The committee comprised officials of the National Treasury,  Statistics  SA,
and the Departments of Agriculture,  Health  and  Social  Development.  This
committee discussed several options to address the domestic food  situation.
The  main  component  of  the  committee's   proposals   is   the   targeted
distribution of  food  parcels  through  nongovernmental  organisations  and
community-based organisations.

Functions related to providing direct assistance to vulnerable  groups  fall
within the ambit of the Department of Social  Development.  In  addition  to
the measures to be taken on the domestic front,  South  Africa  has  made  a
commitment to donate 100Â 000 metric tons of maize to countries in  the  SADC
region.

The contribution to regional food relief will be transferred  to  the  World
Food  Programme  through  the  Foreign  Affairs  budget.  Funds   were   not
appropriated in the relevant departmental  budgets  during  the  adjustments
budget for 2002-03. A special adjustments appropriation  Bill  is  therefore
required to put the departments in a position to incur this expenditure.

Members of the Select Committee on Finance should encourage members of  this
Council to endorse the Food Relief Adjustments Appropriation Bill as  placed
before the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

     GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTINGENCY RESERVE ACCOUNT DEFRAYAL BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon)

Mr K D S DURR:  Chairperson,  what  this  Bill  seeks  is  the  approval  of
Parliament for the defrayal of a  loss  accrued  on  the  Gold  and  Foreign
Exchange Contingency Reserve Account.

Sections 25 and 27 of the South African Reserve Bank Act, Act  90  of  1989,
provide for  the  management  by  the  SA  Reserve  Bank  of  a  gold  price
adjustment account, a foreign exchange  adjustment  account  and  a  forward
exchange contracts adjustment account. Any profits  or  losses  arising  are
recorded on these accounts and accrue to the Government.

Section 28 of the South African Reserve Bank Act provides that the  balances
in these accounts shall be transferred at the close of each  financial  year
to the Gold and Foreign  Exchange  Contingency  Reserve  Account,  which  is
managed by the bank on behalf of  the  Treasury.  On  the  other  hand,  any
losses or any debit  balances  result  in  a  charge  against  the  National
Revenue Fund.

On 31 March 2002 the deficit  balance  on  the  Gold  and  Foreign  Exchange
Contingency Reserve Account was R28,024 million. This amount is  subject  to
an audit investigation currently being undertaken. The  losses  are  largely
the result of losses incurred in  the  bank's  forward  exchange  operations
between 1995 and 1996 when the account was last settled.

During the periods of rand depreciation, losses arose. At times  the  bank's
provision of forward exchange cover has exceeded its  foreign  assets  by  a
wide margin. Over recent years, by agreement, the bank has steadily  reduced
this exposure. The net open  forward  position  has  declined  from  a  high
US$23,2 billion in 1998 to US$1,5 billion in January 2003 -  major  progress
indeed. As a consequence, the Treasury has agreed to settle the  outstanding
balance on the reserve account, subject  to  the  findings  of  the  current
audit investigation, over a four-year period.

An amount of R7 billion will be charged to the National Revenue Fund in  the
2002-03 financial year, and R21,024 billion will be charged  over  the  next
three financial years.

Nil coupon Treasury bonds worth R7 billion were issued  to  the  SA  Reserve
Bank in September 2002-03 and, of this amount, R3Â billion  has  subsequently
been converted into fixed  income  bonds.  Parliamentary  approval  is  thus
sought to regard the defrayal of these losses on the reserve  account  as  a
direct charge against the National Revenue Fund.

The Bill reflects major progress in the  macroeconomic  financial  state  of
our nation and, as such, should be welcomed as a high achievement  both  for
the SA Reserve Bank and for the Treasury. Our congratulations  thus  go  out
to  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  the  Governor  of  the   Reserve   Bank
respectively.

The Select Committee on Finance of the NCOP has  deliberated  carefully  and
considered the legislation, and we recommend  the  Bill  to  the  House  for
approval. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:57.

1.    Report of the Select Committee on Finance on Hearings on  Division  of
     Revenue Bill , dated 26 March 2003:


     The Select Committee on Finance, having held hearings on  the  Division
     of Revenue Bill, referred to it, reports as follows:


     A.     Introduction


         On 6 March 2003,  the  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  [B  9  -  2003]
         (National Assembly - sec 76), after introduction  in  the  National
         Assembly, and amendment [B 9B - 2003] by  the  Portfolio  Committee
         on Finance, was referred to the Select Committee on Finance of  the
         National Council of Provinces. The Committee proceeded to  work  on
         the Bill by hosting  public  hearings  from  Monday,  10  March  to
         Thursday, 14 March 2003.


         The Committee wishes to express its  sincere  appreciation  to  all
         the participants for their  submissions  and  contributions  during
         the hearings. The Committee  would  further  like  to  express  its
         appreciation to National Treasury, the chairperson of  the  Finance
         and Fiscal Commission and his  staff,  SALGA,  the  Office  of  the
         Auditor-General, Directors-General,  Deputy  Directors-General  and
         Chief Financial Officers from the Departments of  Housing,  Health,
         Water Affairs and  Forestry,  Social  Development,  Provincial  and
         Local Government, Education  and  Minerals  and  Energy  for  their
         participation via submissions.


     B.     Objectives of hearings on the Bill


         The Constitution, in section 214, Chapter 13, provides that an  Act
         of Parliament should provide  for  the  equitable  distribution  of
         revenue raised nationally among the national, provincial and  local
         spheres  of  government  to   ensure   that   the   provinces   and
         municipalities are able to provide basic services and  perform  the
         functions allocated to them. Hence, the Division of  Revenue  Bill.
         Section 214(2)  details  criteria  to  be  taken  into  account  in
         determining the division of revenue and indicates the  consultation
         process necessary before  enactment  of  the  Division  of  Revenue
         Bill.


         Over  the  past  three  years,  a  number  of  reforms  have   been
         introduced  in  relation  to  the  administration  of   conditional
         grants, with the view of enhancing their effectiveness as  a  means
         of facilitating improved delivery at sub-national  level.  Notably,
         provinces and local government now receive  three-year  allocations
         for conditional grants and a  framework  for  each  grant,  setting
         out, amongst other things, the purpose  of  the  grant,  measurable
         objectives, conditions, allocation criteria and past performance.


         The  objective  of  the  hearings   on   the   conditional   grants
         administered by departments/municipalities via oral submission  was
         based on the following requirements:


         1. To gather a detailed exposition  on  the  formula  and  criteria
              used for  allocating  each  grant  for  2002/03,  2004/05  and
              2005/06, and the extent to which these comply with section 214
              of  the  Constitution.  In  particular,  how  the   allocation
              mechanism takes into account each of the factors  set  out  in
              section 214(2) (a) to (j); to  also  furnish  all  statistical
              data used for the formula, and indicate the source of all such
              statistical data; to note that this  information  is  critical
              for the  Committee  to  assess  whether  a  department  is  in
              compliance with the criteria outlined in sections 214(2)(a) to
              (j) of the Constitution, stating which  criteria  may  not  be
              applicable, and in respect of those that are  applicable,  how
              the grant gives effect to them.


         2.  To  record  trends  in  allocations,   transfers   and   actual
              expenditure of all departments'  conditional  grants.  Analyse
              the actual allocations by province and municipality, including
              the per head allocation for that grant (using  the  population
              numbers per municipality, published in Appendix E7 of the 2003
              Division of Revenue Bill, or  for  provinces,  the  population
              data in Annexure E, used for the  provincial  equitable  share
              formula).


         3. To briefly assess  the  Departments'/municipalities'  monitoring
              capacity and past performance, for both the  current  and  the
              past years, how Departments monitor compliance every month  by
              provincial and/or local governments as required  by  the  2002
              Division of Revenue Act, including the  conditions  pertaining
              to the grant, as set out in the framework for  the  grant.  To
              indicate whether departments ensure that they do  receive  the
              monthly reports required from receiving provincial departments
              or municipalities, and if not, what is being  done  to  ensure
              compliance.  Where   non-compliance   occurred   in   2001/02,
              explaining the steps taken to ensure full  compliance  in  the
              current financial year (2002/03), and indicate  whether  there
              is evidence of  improvement.  Where  the  Auditor-General  has
              qualified an audit due to a conditional grant, explaining  the
              steps Departments are taking to address the  Auditor-General's
              concerns.


         4. To assess quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators/information
              on  performance  of  conditional  grants  administered  by   a
              department for the 2001/02 financial year, using the ones  set
              out in the framework for the grant as a point of departure. In
              particular,  a  focus   on   the   non-financial   performance
              indicators used by departments.


         5. To motivate why this grant should continue to be  a  conditional
              grant, and not part of the equitable share or an unconditional
              grant.


         The Division of  Revenue  for  2003/2004  is  consistent  with  the
         previous  years  -  2001/2002  and  2002/2003.  The  previous   two
         financial years showed  a  slow  increase  in  real  terms  of  the
         equitable share for Provinces and  municipalities.  Schedule  1  of
         the Division of Revenue:

         National *    185 235 905      200 954 497      220 351 687


         Provincial    142 386 031      155 313 096      167 556 442
         Local     6 343 478   7 077 546       7 698 179


         Total   333 965 414 363 345 139     395 606 308


         The above table illustrates the point that because of improved  tax
         collection  we  are  able  spend  more   money   on   social   non-
         infrastructure- and social infrastructure-related issues.


         This table also shows that  municipalities  are  getting  a  bigger
         share of the nationally-raised revenue. Again, for the first  time,
         share of the  equitable  share  for  all  municipalities  has  been
         published in the Division of  Revenue  Bill,  2003/2004,  which  is
         before the Council. This will assist municipalities  to  know  what
         they are getting from the nationally-raised revenue, but also  this
         development will assist them to plan and to  put  adequate  revenue
         collection policies in place in order that they should be  able  to
         deliver basic services to people.
     C.     Presentations by Departments and Municipalities


         In conducting the public hearings we needed to bring  to  the  fore
         the importance of the Public Finance Management Act, Act No.  1  of
         1999. Management of these grants  is  very  important  in  ensuring
         service delivery. Departments must ensure that  these  grants  flow
         smoothly  between  the  transferring  officer  and  the   receiving
         officer as per the requirement in the framework of the  conditional
         grants.


         The importance  of  conditional  grants  cannot  be  overemphasised
         because they fund  important  functions  such  as  Early  Childhood
         Development, HIV/Aids, the Integrated  Nutrition  Programme  (which
         includes the Primary School Nutrition Programme), extension of  the
         Child Support Grant up to the age of 13, provision  of  bulk  water
         supply by water and forestry, home-based care, poverty relief,  the
         Consolidated Municipal  Infrastructure  Programme  (CMIP)  and  the
         Integrated National Electrification Programme (INEP).


         Performance of Grants, its Successes and Difficulties


         1. Early Childhood Development


              In the next cycle of the MTEF, this  will be incorporated into
              the equitable share so that provinces can decide on their  own
              how best to utilise the resources without deviating  from  the
              principles of providing classrooms for grade  Rs  in  all  the
              schools.


         2. Primary School Nutrition


              This programme will in the next MTEF cycle be included in  the
              Department of Education's budget vote but it will continue  as
              a conditional grant. We welcome this decision since this grant
              was not being utilised fully under the Health  Department.  We
              have been assured that the two departments  are  finalising  a
              transitional plan. In 2004/05 and over the MTEF  from  2005/06
              going forward this function will fall under Education. Notably
              there has  been  a  huge  increase  in  the  school  nutrition
              programme, because of the high number of learners  who  go  to
              school without meals and who  will  probably  come  back  from
              school  to  the  same  circumstances.  These  meals  are  very
              important for such learners, who dearly need them most.


         Grants managed by Department of Water Affairs and Forestry


         3. Water supply systems built by Department of  Water  Affairs  and
              Forestry


              These  supply  systems  will  later  to  be  handed  over   to
              municipalities and are welcomed. However, we would like to see
              a clear plan of hand-over to  those  municipalities  who  have
              capacity and that it be ensured that the maintenance of  these
              do appear in their budgets before they take over the  function
              of maintenance. The water schemes that have  been  built,  are
              indeed important for poor people to get clean and  safe  water
              from their taps.


         Grants managed by Department of Health


         4. Health Professions Training and Development Grant


              This grant is very important, because  it  will  assist  rural
              provinces to attract professionals to go and work in the under-
              served provinces. It will also  enable  shifting  of  teaching
              activities from central hospitals  to  regional  and  district
              facilities. Therefore, it is very crucial that we monitor  how
              this grant is going to perform throughout the financial  year.
              This is a direct  response  from  the  issues  raised  in  the
              Intergovernmental Fiscal Review of 2001, where it  was  stated
              that professionals are concentrated in Gauteng and the Western
              Cape in the main.


         5. HIV/Aids grant


              This grant has not performed well because the amounts involved
              are too small. At this point we have indicated over the  years
              that some of these grants must be consolidated  into  one  big
              grant so that the impact can be  felt  and  we  can  be  in  a
              position  to  measure  the  stated  measurable  objectives  or
              outputs.


         6. Hospital Management and Quality Improvement Grant


              The purpose of this  grant  is  to  strengthen  management  in
              hospitals, development  of  management  and  structures.  This
              grant is very important because many public hospitals  do  not
              have good and strong management. Systems are not effective and
              efficient for proper utilisation of the limited resources that
              government is providing to these public  health  institutions.
              It is the view of the Committee that these  improvements  will
              lead to many people using public hospitals.


         Grants managed by Social Development


         7. HIV/Aids Home-Based Care


              The purpose is to render services to  orphans  and  vulnerable
              children who are infected and affected by  HIV/Aids.  Some  of
              these grants are clearly meant to intervene in the scourge  of
              HIV/Aids,  but  it  is,  however,  disappointing   that   some
              provinces  have  not  spent  the  whole  allocation  given  by
              national departments.


         8. Extension of Child Support Grant (CSG)


              We have seen a major increase over the years - in the  current
              financial year the CSG was supposed to be  extended  to  three
              million children in the country. In the 2003/04 financial year
              we have seen the grant being extended up to the age of 13, and
              it will continue over the METF. This will be done  in  phases:
              2003/04 - seven- and eight-year old children; 2004/05 -  nine-
              and 10-year old children; and 2005/2006 - 11-, 12- and 13-year
              old children. The phased approach will assist  to  absorb  the
              shocks that might impact on the budget process because  if  it
              is introduced all at once, for all the above  age  groups,  it
              will indeed have a negative impact.


         9. Food Relief Grant


              This grant is aimed at assisting poor households who have been
              severely affected by the increase in food prices. The criteria
              used were the household expenditure per province, which  gives
              an indication of poverty levels per  province,  in  particular
              targeting women and children in the rural areas.


         Grants managed by Department of Provincial and local Government


         10.     Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Programme grants


              Transfer of  funds  from  the  transferring  department  to  a
              particular municipality should  not  be  transferred  via  the
              province,  but  must  be  sent  directly   to   the   relevant
              municipality because the flow of funds is very slow.
              The allocation to the 21 nodal points remains a key concern to
              the Committee in particular, because National Departments have
              not contributed their portion in the financing of these  nodal
              points. We would like to raise  a  serious  concern  that  the
              failure of these departments to contribute, will undermine the
              stated objective of the nodal  points.  We  will  continue  to
              raise the matter with the Department of Provincial  and  Local
              Government and other affected departments.


     D.     Auditor-General


         The Auditor- General (A-G) has  engaged  with  National  Government
         Departments on their failure to monitor conditional  grants,  which
         were given to provinces and different municipalities. We also  have
         a new provision in the Bill, Clause 20, which refers to the  duties
         of the A-G. This Clause allows the  A-G  to  audit  the  grant  and
         submit the report to  Parliament.  This  is  as  a  result  of  our
         engagement with the A-G.


         The A-G has given the Committee  shocking  figures,  in  that  some
         national  departments,  some  provincial   departments   and   some
         municipalities do not regularly pay audit fees. This seems to be  a
         matter of concern to the Committee.


         Municipalities need to ensure that their budgets  reflect  what  is
         contained  in  the  Integrated  Development  Plan.  This  is   very
         important in order for us as a country and a nation to be  able  to
         measure outputs. The conditional grants  for  financial  management
         is aimed at assisting municipalities with capacity building.


         Municipalities which appeared before the Committee, indicated  that
         some provincial and national departments do not regularly  pay  for
         their rates and taxes.
     E.     Achievements


         *  The report of the Select Committee, dated March 2001,  based  on
           the Division of Revenue Bill [B 11B - 2001], indicated that some
           grants were introduced rather late  during  the  financial  year
           (gazetted 28 August 2000), which posed a spending problem.  With
           the division of revenue being tabled earlier and  the  budgetary
           system in constant refinement, this problem seems to  have  been
           addressed. At this stage, this issue is being addressed  and  we
           welcome the efforts made by Treasury.


         *  The publication of municipal  conditional  grants  is  surely  a
           step in the right direction and would give municipalities a more
           predictable  and  stable  fiscal  environment.  That  will  make
           municipalities more attractive to private lenders and investors.
           Another achievement well noted.
         *  The recommendations made by the Committee in the  2002  Division
           of Revenue hearings report have also been adhered  too,  in  the
           context  of  the   need   to   strengthen   accountability   and
           transparency and increased efforts to improve reporting. A clear
           indication of this is the Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
           Management Bill currently before Parliament, to be enacted soon.


         *  Introduction of tight measures to  deal  with  departments  that
           have not implemented the PMFA, is a challenge that was noted  in
           the report on Division of Revenue, 2002.  This  has  been  dealt
           with in section 55 of  the  PMFA  and  also  Clause  20  of  the
           Division of Revenue Bill, 2003, and will further be strengthened
           in the regulation catered for in Clause 33 of the Bill.


     F.     Recommendations


         *  Strategic plans  need  to  speak  to  budgets  and  vice  versa,
           especially  at  national  and  provincial   level,   to   ensure
           consistency and performance.


         *  Provinces need  to  table  a  summary  of  their  allocation  to
           municipalities timeously to allow municipalities to plan.


         *  Office of the Auditor-General: The Audit Committee and  internal
           auditing should be strengthened. This  should  be  done  in  the
           broader context when the intergovernmental  system  is  reviewed
           after the first 10 years of our democracy.


         *    Encourage   discussions   between   service   providers    and
           municipalities  to  negotiate  service  delivery  agreements  to
           strengthen    accountability    (political     authority)     to
           people/clients (basic service rendering).


         *  Municipal budgets should be aligned with Integrated  Development
           Plans (IDPs).


         *   Division  of  Revenue  allocations  to  spheres  -   challenges
           municipalities and provinces to take allocation  of  grants  and
           own revenue and align it with own revenue and budget  consistent
           with IDPs.


         *  IDPs are in the process of change, the growing  development  due
           to statutory requirements of IDPs, municipalities must  use  the
           conditional grant for capacity  building  in  order  to  produce
           credible and proper IDPs and avoid usage of consultants.


         *   Cash-flow  plans  should  be  monitored/reported  quarterly  to
           prevent fiscal flow dumping - early warning systems in the  form
           of quarterly reports should be used  effectively  as  tools  for
           monitoring.


         *  Devolution of further  functions  is  supported.  However,  such
           functions must be followed by funds.


         *  Where possible, we would like to call upon National  Departments
           to give funds direct to municipalities who have capacity.


         *  There  are  difficulties  with  the  published  figures  by  the
           Treasury vis-Ã -vis the departmental figures, and  we  will  urge
           all departments to work toward systems that talk to  each  other
           or one another.


         *  Policy differences, which result in delays in  the  delivery  of
           services, must be avoided at all costs. We want to appeal to all
           government departments at  all  levels  and  to  departments  in
           between to improve in this area.


         *  The A-G's response indicates that  alternative  measures  should
           be employed to resolve differences between spheres of government
           other than the extreme measure of litigation.


     G.     Conclusion


         We  would  have  appreciated  more  time  to  allow  provinces  and
         municipalities to engage more on the bill. In future we would  like
         to see the NCOP Programme Committee take into account the  Division
         of  Revenue  Bill  and   allow   more   time   to   provinces   and
         municipalities to engage the bill.


         Sincere thanks go to the Ministers who took time to  appear  before
         the Committee, including those who sent written apologies  or  made
         phone calls to the chairperson of the  Committee.  Many  thanks  to
         those colleagues from provinces. Thank you also  to  the  permanent
         delegates,  as  your  contribution   and   interaction   with   the
         departments were very informative. Our sincere thanks go  to  Henry
         Eksteen for his hard work and dedication to assist the Committee.


         Lastly, we would like to thank the NCOP Presiding Officers and  the
         Chief Whip, who gave permission for us to remain in Parliament  and
         conduct the public hearings.
