                          UNPARLIAMENTARY LANGUAGE

                                  (Ruling)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! On  2  September,  during  the  Second
Reading debate on the Liquor Bill, the Minister of Trade and  Industry,  the
hon Mr A Erwin, expressed concern about a statement made by the hon Mr  Lowe
earlier in the debate.

The statement being contested appears  in  the  following  extract  from  Mr
Lowe's speech: "Some commentators have seriously wondered  if  the  Minister
hasn't been bought by an industry still buried in apartheid."

When the hon Mr Lowe said that he could not withdraw the  statement  on  the
basis that he did not make it himself but was merely quoting  someone  else,
I undertook to examine the Hansard before  making  a  final  ruling.  Having
examined the Hansard, I wish to rule as follows. Order! Members,  could  you
be seated, please.

I wish to rule as follows: To suggest that the Minister has been  bought  is
clearly accusing the Minister, a member of this House, of  being  guilty  of
corrupt practices. The fact that the member was  quoting  commentators  does
not alter the effect of the statement. A remark is no less offensive  if  it
is  quoted  as  having  been  made  by  someone  else.  It  would  still  be
unacceptable to quote an unparliamentary assertion, even if this  were  done
in the context of a question. By quoting  such  a  remark  made  by  someone
else, a member is still casting a reflection on  the  integrity  of  another
member in the House, and that is unacceptable. The  statement  is  therefore
unparliamentary, and I must request the hon Mr Lowe to withdraw it.

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairman,  I  would  like  to  withdraw  the  statement  and
apologise to the House. I am sorry  that  the  Minister  is  not  here  this
morning, but I have written to him personally to apologise as well.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank your for that, hon Lowe. [Applause.]

Furthermore, during  the  same  debate  on  the  Liquor  Bill,  the  hon  Mr
Pretorius raised a point of order in regard to  an  expression  by  the  hon
Minister of Trade and Industry  addressed  to  the  hon  Mr  Lowe.  The  hon
Minister, in referring to Mr Lowe, said: "He is a little twerp who has  done
nothing in his past." The  Minister  said  that  if  the  word  "twerp"  was
unparliamentary,  he  would  withdraw  it.  "Twerp"  is  an  insulting   and
derogatory word and,  as  such,  unparliamentary.  Since  the  Minister  has
already indicated that he would withdraw the word,  I  accept  that  it  has
indeed been withdrawn.

On a further point of order, the hon Mr Ramgobin asked whether  the  hon  Mr
Lowe should not have been asked to leave the Chamber, as he  had  failed  to
withdraw the remarks when asked to do so by the Chair.

It is my view that as I had agreed to check Hansard before  giving  a  final
ruling, the member's  withdrawal  from  the  House  was  not  necessary.  In
addition to that, the hon Prof Turok indicated that in  his  response  to  a
ruling by the Chair, the hon Mr Lowe had said:  "Mr  Chairman,  if  you  had
been listening to my speech, you would have heard that I had said  ..."  The
hon Prof Turok suggested that this amounted to  disrespect  for  the  Chair.
Although this could indeed be perceived as disrespect for the  Chair,  I  am
of the view that in the context in which the statement was made it  was  not
meant to show disrespect for the  Chair.  Therefore,  I  do  not  intend  to
pursue this matter any further and I would ever caution  members  always  to
show the respect that is due to the Chair. I thank you.

We now come to notices of motion. Does any member wish to give a  notice  of
a motion? None. Are there any motions without notice?

            CALLS TO PREVENT THE DEATH SENTENCE ON MS AMINA LAWAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, before I  actually  raise
the motion without notice, could I take this opportunity to thank  yourself,
the House, as well as members of staff for installing  a  microphone  on  my
desk. That makes my work much easier. Thank you. [Laughter.]


  I hereby move without notice:


  That the House -


     (1)    is concerned about -


         (a)     the death sentence  imposed  upon  Ms  Amina  Lawal  by  an
              ecclesiastical court in Nigeria; and


         (b)     the violation of the  letter  and  spirit  of  the  African
              Charter of Human Rights that this sentence represents;


     (2)    calls upon His Excellency  President  Mbeki,  President  of  the
         Republic of South Africa, and His  Excellency  President  Chissano,
         President of Mozambique and Chairman of the African Union,  to  use
         their influence with His Excellency President Obasanjo  of  Nigeria
         to -


         (a)     use  his  powers  to  prevent  the  carrying  out  of  this
              barbaric sentence; and


         (b)     ensure the physical security of the  persons  of  Ms  Amina
              Lawal and her child, who have already suffered very deeply.

Agreed to.

        BEST WISHES FOR SA CRICKET TEAM IN LAST TEST AGAINST ENGLAND

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr J DURAND: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) die  Suid-Afrikaanse  krieketspan,  wat  tans  met  Engeland  ``kolwe
       kruis'', alle voorspoed toewens met die laaste toets in die reeks;


  (2) kennis neem dat indien Graeme Smith en sy span dié toets wen, dit die
       eerste keer sal wees dat 'n Suid-Afrikaanse span 'n toets op die Oval
       en drie toetse in 'n toetsreeks in Engeland wen;


     3) duimvashou dat  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  span  krieketgeskiedenis  gaan
        maak.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)


[Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) wishes the South African cricket team, "crossing bats"  with  England
       at the moment, everything of the best  with  the  last  test  in  the
       series;


  (2) notes that if Graeme Smith and his team win it will be the first time
       that a South African team wins a test at the Oval and three tests  in
       a series in England; and


     3) holds thumbs that the South African team makes cricket history.]


Agreed to.

                     CELEBRATION OF NATIONAL ARBOR WEEK

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  this week, from 1  to  7  September,  South  Africans  celebrate
           National Arbor Week - Iviki Lezihlahla;


       (b)   the  week-long  celebrations  were  officially  launched  at  a
           ceremony in Evaton, Johannesburg, on 28 August  2003,  with  the
           theme ``Trees are our Heritage'';


       (c)  September, being Heritage Month, is the time to reflect  on  how
           trees and forests contribute to all people having a better life;
           and


       (d)  this year's celebrations focus, among others, on -


              (i) how forests and trees are being utilised  by  communities,
                       in conjunction with the state, for the eradication of
                       poverty and promoting economic development; and


              (ii)      the  promotion   of   behavioural   change   through
                       highlighting the destruction  that  veld  and  forest
                       fires cause each year;


  (2) believes that, since 1994, the  Government's  approach  has  been  to
       recognise trees and forests as  a  national  resource  that  must  be
       protected; and


  (3) calls on all South Africans not only to  participate  in  this  Arbor
       Week, but to commit themselves  to  the  theme  of  ``Trees  are  our
       Heritage''.


  Agreed to.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, can you take your  seats,
please. Thank you. Please proceed, hon member.

                       DEPUTY PRESIDENT AND ANC IMAGE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr O BAPELA (ANC): Chairperson, recently the UDM and  the  DA  continued  in
their efforts to ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, we cannot hear you. You  are  not
audible. Could you start again.

Mr O BAPELA: Thank you, Chairperson. Recently the UDM and the  DA  continued
in their efforts to gain cheap political mileage by  attempting  to  destroy
the reputation of  Deputy  President  Jacob  Zuma  and  the  ANC.  The  real
casualties of these attacks are the  rule  of  law,  and  our  Constitution,
courts and institutions supporting democracy. These institutions  have  been
subjected to a  pattern  of  consistent  and  calculated  attacks  on  their
integrity.

Our society, led by the ANC, has advanced significantly towards  accountable
and transparent governance and is rooting out corruption wherever  it  might
exist. Reputable studies domestically and internationally  confirm  that  in
South Africa most cases of corruption are exposed  by  the  institutions  of
the democratic state through mechanisms put in place after 1994.

We must intensify the fight  against  corruption  on  the  basis  of  tested
facts. No one is above the law. The law must take its  course.  All  persons
must be presumed innocent until proven guilty. We must not fall prey to  the
appetite for lynching and  trials  by  media  which  has  seized  opposition
parties and much of the media in recent weeks. Until such time that a  court
of law or competent institution of justice  passes  a  guilty  verdict,  the
Deputy President should not be subjected to any disciplinary process  or  be
asked to relinquish his position.

We will not be deterred from  strengthening  our  criminal  justice  system,
fighting corruption, pushing back the frontiers of poverty  and  building  a
united and democratic nation. [Applause.]

    CALL FOR BROAD-BASED EMPOWERMENT TO START AT THE BOTTOM, NOT THE TOP

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C M LOWE (DA): Mr  Chairman,  the  need  to  transform  our  economy  and
empower millions of South Africans excluded by apartheid  is  more  pressing
than ever. But the DA believes that broad-based empowerment  must  start  at
the bottom, not the top; that we must empower many, not just a few.

True empowerment tackles poverty, unemployment and inadequate education,  is
measured by job-creation  entrepreneurship  and  comes  from  giving  people
skills, resources and opportunities to realise their full potential.

Yesterday the DA launched its empowerment  policy,  "Opportunity  for  All",
from a fabric-painting factory run out of a tiny two-roomed shack in a  back
alley of Crossroads. We did so because we know that  genuine  and  effective
broad-based empowerment starts at grass-roots level,  reaching  real  people
who epitomise the kind of entrepreneurship that the Government's BEE  policy
should target for assistance and advancement, but sadly has not. The  people
who need and deserve empowerment are not the ANC cronies, the fat  cats  and
Wabenzi, but ordinary people in  Crossroads  and  millions  more  like  them
across South Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]

  GREATER COMMITMENT REQUIRED FROM ROLE-PLAYERS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S A SEATON (IFP): Chairperson, after presiding over a disappointing two-
day criminal court session  at  Izingolweni  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  a  regional
magistrate, Mr Johan  Bester,  said  that  unless  the  role-players  showed
greater commitment,  the  criminal  justice  system  in  our  country  would
collapse.

His remarks came after four serious matters on the court roll could  not  be
finalised as a result of incompetence by police and justice  officials.  One
of the matters  not  finalised,  an  attempted  murder  charge,  had  to  be
withdrawn as a  result  of  the  investigating  officer  arriving  at  court
without his docket.

Mr Bester has urged these officials to engage in some introspection  instead
of blaming everyone else for their shortcomings, and that if  they  are  not
dedicated to the creation of a society based on the notions of  justice  and
democracy they should make room for people who are. Instances such as  those
that happened at Izingolweni should not happen at all. They cause people  to
lose confidence in the officials and the  system  that  is  supposed  to  be
there for their protection.

We therefore urge all relevant role-players in the criminal  justice  system
throughout the country to take note of what Mr Bester has said, so  that  we
can work towards  creating  an  efficient  and  effective  criminal  justice
system that will inspire confidence in our people.

 DA OPPOSITION TO BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT BILL NOT REFLECTED
                                  IN MEDIA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M M MASALA (ANC): Chairperson, on  2  September,  that  is  Tuesday  this
week,  this  House  debated  and  passed  the  Broad-Based  Black   Economic
Empowerment Bill. The Bill seeks to improve participation by the  previously
disadvantaged in the productive resources of this  country  and  contributes
towards the attainment of the constitutional right to equality.

The media reported that the  Broad-Based  Black  Economic  Empowerment  Bill
received overwhelming support from parties in this House. Given that the  DA
voted against the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Bill, we call  upon
the DA to correct those media reports as they cannot expect to  be  credited
with  the  economic   empowerment   of   blacks   and   equitable   economic
redistribution when they opposed the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

      BEST WISHES EXTENDED TO MARIA RAMOS IN HER NEW TRANSNET POSITION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mev ANNA VAN WYK (Nuwe NP): Speaker, die Nuwe NP het genoë om die Direkteur-
Generaal van die Tesourie, me Maria Ramos, van harte geluk te wens met  haar
aanstelling in haar nuwe amp as hoof uitvoerende beampte van  Transnet.  Ons
wens haar sterkte toe met die nuwe uitdagings wat vir  haar  voor  die  deur
lê.

Suid-Afrika was bevoorreg om oor die dienste van iemand van haar kaliber  in
beheer van die dissipline van Suid-Afrika se staatsfinansies te kon  beskik.
Die wye aansien wat sy in finansiële kringe geniet,  volg  op  die  vertroue
wat  ondernemers,  sowel  as  beleggers,  in  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  ekonomie
ontwikkel het. Die feit  dat  finansiële  markte  nie  tot  dusver  negatief
gereageer het op die aankondiging dat sy haar  pos  gaan  ontruim  nie,  dui
daarop dat die verwagting  bestaan  dat  streng  finansiële  dissipline  oor
staatsuitgawes gehandhaaf gaan word.

Die Nuwe NP het genoeg vertroue in die Minister van  Finansies,  mnr  Trevor
Manuel, om te glo dat hy 'n betroubare beheerstruktuur in plek sal plaas  om
die leemte te vul wat die bedanking van me Ramos agterlaat.  Suid-Afrika  is
trots op me Ramos, en die vroue van die  Nuwe  NP  baie  spesifiek.  Dankie.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mrs ANNA  VAN  WYK  (New  NP):  Speaker,  the  New  NP  takes  pleasure  in
expressing its hearty congratulations to the Director-General  of  Treasury,
Ms Maria Ramos, on her appointment in her new position  as  chief  executive
officer of Transnet. We wish her all the best with the new challenges  ahead
of her.

South Africa was privileged to have had  the  services  of  someone  of  her
calibre in control of the discipline of South Africa's  state  finance.  The
great respect she commanded  in  financial  circles  was  a  result  of  the
confidence which entrepreneurs, as well  investors,  had  developed  in  the
South African economy. The fact that up to now financial  markets  have  not
reacted negatively to the announcement that she is going to vacate her  post
indicates that the expectation exists that strict financial discipline  over
state expenditure will be maintained.

The New NP has enough confidence in  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Mr  Trevor
Manuel, to believe that he will introduce a reliable  control  structure  to
fill the gap left by the resignation of Ms Ramos. South Africa is  proud  of
Ms  Ramos,  and  the  women  of  the  New  NP  in  particular.  Thank   you.
[Applause.]]

     CALLS FOR MPUMALANGA HEALTH MEC AND HEAD OF DEPARTMENT TO STEP DOWN

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C DUDLEY (ACDP): Chair, disgraced Mpumalanga health MEC Sibongile  Manana
and head of department Rina Charles should step down  immediately  and  face
criminal   charges   after   shocking   revelations   of   corruption    and
maladministration in the department.

After forensic audit reports revealed evidence  of  corruption,  Manana  was
reshuffled to the Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts  and  Culture  while
Charles will trade jobs with the deputy director-general  in  the  premier's
office.

What these officials have done is criminal and it is unacceptable that  they
remain in positions of responsibility within the  Government.  Taking  money
from dying people and squandering it on all kinds of scams and frivolity  is
disgraceful.

Both Manana and Charles  have  betrayed  the  people's  trust.  The  premier
should follow through with disciplinary action against all  those  involved,
and not merely redeploy them. The Department of Sport, Recreation, Arts  and
Culture is key to development within  Mpumalanga,  and  Manana  and  Charles
will carry the scandal with them.

Evidence of mismanagement and financial waste were  already  evident  during
the Portfolio Committee on Health's visit to  Mpumalanga  last  year,  where
huge pieces of hi-tech equipment stood idle in empty rooms with no staff  to
use them. The fact that the department ordered this equipment merely to  use
up their budget is despicable.
All those involved in this corruption  must  be  held  accountable,  and  we
welcome the handing of the forensic audit report to the Scorpions  in  order
to prosecute those involved. Thank you.

                       BY-ELECTIONS IN GREATER GIYANI

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C J MALULEKE-HLANEKI (ANC): Chairperson and  hon  House,  through  action
the people of South Africa are conveying the message consistently  that  the
tide has turned. On 27 August 2003 a by-election took place  in  ward  1  of
the Greater Giyani municipality in Limpopo.  The  ANC  participated  in  the
elections and emerged with a landslide victory  of  966  votes  to  the  145
votes for the opposition.

These achievements come a short while after the ANC won elections in ward  1
of Greater Letaba, unopposed.

Eka siku ra namuntlha hi rhandza ku  hoyozela  vaaka-tiko  va  ka  Ximawusa,
Blinkwater na Noblehoek va le ward 1 YA  Giyani  ku  va  va  swi  kotile  ku
hlawula ntlawa wun'we ntsena lowu nga wona wa ntikelo na vundzuku bya  vona,
ku nga ANC.

Hi hoyozela na yena murhumiwa lontshwa wa ANC khanselara  James  Ndlovu.  Hi
ri khoma swi tiya wena gaceni,  wena  wa  wa  zindlopfu  azilubani  zilubana
ngomsindo.  Ugaceni,  udla  imithi,  ndlopfu.  Khanimambo.  (Translation  of
Xitsonga paragraphs follows.)

[Today we wish to congratulate ward 1 communities  of  Ximawusa,  Blinkwater
and Noblehoek for electing a  political  party,  the  ANC,  that  has  their
future at heart.

We congratulate the new representative of the ANC, councillor James  Ndlovu.
We wish you the best in your new challenge.]

                    COLLAPSE OF SERVICES AT ONDERSTEPOORT

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr A E VAN NIEKERK (FA): Chairperson, the hon Minister of Agriculture  Thoko
Didiza  remains  silent  on  the  serious  erosion  of   services   at   the
Agricultural Research Council. Dr Freek Potgieter,  a  research  leader  and
manager of undisputed merit at Onderstepoort, was  suspended.  In  addition,
key services at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute have collapsed.

While the Limpopo province experiences more and more outbreaks of  foot-and-
mouth, the Onderstepoort centre is increasingly unable to respond to  crises
of an epidemic nature. This threatens the livestock assets of rural  people,
human health and access for our exports to world markets.

I have asked Minister Didiza whether she believes  that  Onderstepoort,  the
ARC and the national Department of Agriculture are still able to play  their
former role as the effective provider of remedies for veterinary crises  and
other Southern African countries, that is, for  stalling  the  spreading  of
diseases to South Africa.

Neither the Minister and the national Department of Agriculture nor the  ARC
appears able to answer these questions.

                 THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDENTS OBTAINING SKILLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S E M PHEKO (PAC): Chairperson, education is  the  key  to  a  successful
life. It is a tool for mental liberation. It  enables  the  people  to  take
charge of their cultural and psychological direction. Our education must  be
tailored to the needs of our people so that every  educated  person  with  a
profession of skill can contribute to the welfare of our people.

The PAC wants our education to be diversified. It must be a good mixture  of
academic and vocational subjects. No student must  reach  matric  without  a
skill of some kind, which he or she can use to earn a  living.  The  massive
unemployment that we  see  today  dictates  that  our  system  of  education
promotes  self-reliance  through  vocational  courses  without  compromising
academic education for those  who  would  like  to  go  to  universities  or
technikons.

Because education is so important, the PAC is advocating free education  for
students from poor homes. Africans, in particular, have been  denied  proper
education for many years under colonialism and apartheid. Too many  students
cannot complete their studies today because their parents are poor  and  are
unable to pay the fees.

The PAC is disturbed that recent statistics show  that  60%  of  our  matric
students countrywide have dropped out of schools  and  that  only  40%  will
write matric exams this year. Many university students are  owing  fees  and
cannot complete their degrees. [Time expired.]

                           WITHDRAWAL OF STATEMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr F BHENGU  (ANC):  Chairperson,  in  a  statement  made  in  the  National
Assembly on 2 September 2003 by Anthony James Leon, the leader  of  the  DA,
he  abused  parliamentary  privilege  by   launching   an   unwarranted   an
unsubstantiated   attack   on   the   ANC   and   Minister   Essop    Pahad.
[Interjections.]

The ANC rejects the allegations completely and insinuations contained in  Mr
Leon's statement to the effect that the ANC or  Mr  Pahad  had  in  any  way
undermined the investigation of alleged wrongdoing in the  arms  procurement
process.

The ANC has written to the Speaker of the National Assembly submitting  that
Mr Anthony James Leon contravened both the letter, as well  as  the  spirit,
of a resolution of the Assembly which states that a  member  who  wishes  to
bring any improper conduct on the part of another member  to  the  attention
of the House should do so  by  way  of  a  separate,  substantiative  motion
comprising a clearly formulated and properly  substantiated  charge.  Except
for by way of such  a  substantiative  motion,  the  member  should  not  be
allowed to impute  improper  motives  to  other  members  or  cast  personal
reflections on their integrity as members or  verbally  abuse  them  in  any
other way. [Interjections.

The ANC has asked that the statement be ruled out of order and  Mr  Leon  be
requested to withdraw his statement  unconditionally  and  apologise  to  Mr
Pahad and the House. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr G B D McINTOSH: You are such babies!

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time  had  expired  but  you
ignored my call, and we let you complete that.

                    THE REDEPLOYMENT OF SIBONGILE MANANA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B G BELL (DA): Mr Chairperson, the reshuffling of the  former  Mpumalanga
Health MEC, Sibongile Manana, to the Department of Sport,  Recreation,  Arts
and  Culture  by  Premier  Mahlangu  indicates  the  lingering  malaise   in
Mpumalanga. Premier Mahlangu is known to have said that  politicians  caught
lying to the public should  be  not  be  axed  or  disciplined  because  the
practice is widespread and accepted political technique.

Also redeploying Manana's former  DG,  Rina  Charles,  to  the  position  of
deputy director-general in his office, and yet in her  former  capacity  the
department lost two court cases and was ordered to  pay  legal  costs  after
failing  to  evict  Gripp  from  the  province's  hospitals  for   supplying
antiretrovirals to rape survivors.

Why did  the  ANC's  redeployment  committee,  allegedly  headed  by  Deputy
President  Zuma,  with  the  knowledge  and  approval  of  President  Mbeki,
approved  these  redeployments?  These  two  individuals  should  have  been
redeployed to the unemployment line and not put in another  job  where  they
can waste taxpayers' money.

This move highlights the lack of a sound, moral  and  ethical  basis  within
the ANC when it comes to fighting corruption and mismanagement.  [Applause.]

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr U ROOPNARAIN  (IFP):  Mr  Chairperson,  last  weekend  police  in  Durban
uncovered a pornographic syndicate involving a Russian couple.  This  couple
performed sordid sexual acts with their own  children,  aged  between  three
and four, and thereafter produced pornographic  videos  and  magazines  from
these ghastly and disgusting acts.

Furthermore, these children  were  totally  unaware  that  they  were  being
abused and used by their own parents. This is a crime against  children  and
their innocence. This Parliament needs to  say:  Enough  is  enough  and  no
more.

The IFP welcomes the efforts by the SAPS in cracking the case and  calls  on
the Minister of Justice to ensure that this couple  and  other  perpetrators
of crimes against children are brought  to  book.  Let  us  not  stagger  or
waiver but ensure that our children are safe.
                 A SOUTH AFRICAN STUDENT SCOOPS WATER AWARD

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R A NDZANGA (ANC): A 17-year old Claire Reid,  a  grade  11  student  at
Saint Teresa's Mercy in Rosebank, Johannesburg,  was  recently  awarded  the
prestigious 2003 Stockholm Junior Water Prize  for  her  water  conservation
project called `` reel gardening.'' Claire's project involved  developing  a
water-wise reel gardening system,  a  simple  and  effective  seed  planting
system that cuts down water usage by as much as 80%.

The Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry, earlier this year, launched  the
first South African Youth Water Prize, known in Northern Sotho as  Bafsa  le
Meetse. The award, which is to be held annually, recognises  the  role  that
South African youth  plays  in  promoting  water,  sanitation,  hygiene  and
hygiene-related issues in the country.

The ANC congratulates  Claire  for  her  achievement  of  winning  both  the
national  and  international  awards.   We   also   want   to   extend   our
congratulations to the winners of the second and third prizes of  the  Bafsa
le Meetse award. Thank you. [Applause.]

                         BRAIN DRAIN IN HEALTH CARE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S J GOUS (New NP): Mr Chair, a recent World  Health  Organisation  report
which stated that 38% of health workers in South Africa plan  to  leave  the
country due to the deterioration of the health system is alarming.

What is even more alarming is the proposal for a certificate of need in  the
National Health Bill which is, today, before Parliament  because  this  will
certainly increase the above-mentioned brain drain. The certificate of  need
will be a prerequisite  before  any  health  practice  might  operate  in  a
certain area. This means that health professionals will not  be  allowed  to
practice in areas of their choice. The New NP as well  as  the  majority  of
inputs presented at the  hearings  on  the  National  Health  Bill  strongly
opposed this measure.

According to  the  SA  Registrars'  Association,  which  consists  of  young
doctors who are currently specialising, the intention of the certificate  of
need will exponentially intensify the insecurity and demoralisation  of  the
junior doctors. They also stated that a career in the public  health  sector
is not popular any more due to  the  general  deterioration  in  the  public
health system. Though private  practice  is  another  possible  career,  the
spectre of the certificate of need has cast huge doubts  over  this  sector.
Therefore, the only option that remains for them is to  leave  the  country.
Thank you. [Applause.]

                               FREE EDUCATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF  EDUCATION:  Mr  Chairperson,  in  fact,  three  areas  were
touched on regarding the education social sector but I will not take up  the
time of the House, although I'm fit and willing to do so.

I would like to remind the hon Mr Lowe that you can't, on a Friday  morning,
forsake an understanding  of  the  topic  through  a  kind  of  professional
earnestness. It may be due to a Friday morning  that  there  is  a  kind  of
mental geriatrics stirring up emotions here.

However, I want to reply particularly to the hon Dr Pheko. We are  embarking
on this reform of the matriculation examination  in  order  to  allow  young
people not only to do the academic courses in the whole matric but also  the
occupational and technical courses through  Setas.  So,  young  people  will
have an equal opportunity and equal status to do this for the first time.  I
met with a German delegation - in fact, we are  working  very  closely  with
the German approach. The Germans have the best system in Europe, which  also
takes into account the needs for middle-level technology.  I  hope  that  we
shall be able to debate this because Cabinet has  passed  the  new  national
curriculum statement.
Another point is that it is not true that 60% of matric students  drop  out;
it is the figure of how many people who enter school drop out. We  have  the
highest participation rate in primary school. We meet  the  ``education  for
all'' conditions which were laid down by the United Nations.  We  have  100%
participation rate in primary schools. All of that  has  been  done  in  the
last four years!  We  have  the  highest  participation  rate  in  secondary
schools: Fifty-three per cent of the kids of  that  group  go  to  secondary
schools. And I'm pleased to announce to  the  House  that  the  majority  of
secondary school children are in fact women. This puts us in the same  level
with many economically advanced countries  of  the  OECD.  We  have  a  high
participation rate, like those countries.

As for free education, let me tell the House: There ain't no such  thing  as
free education. The taxpayer pays for that.  Regarding  the  countries  that
you quoted who have free  education,  their  educational  system  is  in  an
appalling state. What we are trying to do is to provide for the  per  capita
grant for the poorest 20%, 40% and 60% of the children. So, it  must  be  an
anti-poverty drive rather than providing a  larger  subsidy  to  the  middle
class, if you have so-called free education, because we  will  have  to  pay
grants to the schools that, in fact, maintain  larger  numbers  of  teachers
and have more subjects that are taught. In fact, we don't want  to  transfer
more money to those who are privileged already in the educational system.

However, I think it is important to recognise that  we  have  to  embark  on
lifelong learning in such a way that our children acquire skills in  schools
which they are able to use - whether in technikons, universities, for  Setas
or at the revamped and reorganised technical  colleges.  I  think  that's  a
much more sensible way of looking at it than referring to the fat  cats  who
are always there, historically, and all the cronies that you have  had  from
the society that has nurtured  you.  And,  finally,  you  are  the  original
upholders of the Wabenzi policies.

                         BRAIN DRAIN IN HEALTH CARE

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, I just  want  to  rise  to  say  it  is
unfortunate that Dr Gous, in the first instance, did not attend the  meeting
of the WHO in Johannesburg. In fact, the party was visibly absent.

However, I think it is wrong to then take a report  and  analyse  it  glibly
and not come and give all the facts here. I think what he should  have  told
this House is that most South Africans said, in the survey  that  was  done,
that they wanted external experience. This is  the  core  reason  why  South
Africans are leaving. Therefore, this gives us an  opportunity  to  actually
plan how we can recruit and make them return around that  issue  of  wanting
to gain external experience.

To pre-empt a debate that  is  still  going  to  take  place  regarding  the
certificate of need, I think, is also wrong. I think he should  have  waited
until we debate the National Health Bill so that we can give Parliament  the
real truth of what we mean about the certificate of need, not  what  he  has
just said. Thank you very much. And, I shall do that in a while.

      APPOINTMENT OF MARIA RAMOS AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF TRANSNET

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR PUBLIC ENTERPRISES: Chair, as  a  shareholder  Minister  in
Transnet, I'm very happy about the appointment of Maria Ramos  to  the  helm
of Transnet as chief executive officer.  Because  Transnet  is  one  of  the
premier logistics and  transportation  companies  in  Africa,  and,  as  the
President has indicated recently, because transport  is  increasingly  going
to play a critical role in  the  economic  transformation  of  our  country,
having a person of the calibre of Maria at the helm of Transnet will  propel
Transnet into a higher level than the predecessors have done  thus  far.  We
are going to see a lot of action in Transnet, with  a  lot  of  funds  being
spent for infrastructure development in the rail, air and ports sectors.
So, I was just responding to that comment by the hon member. We  think  it's
a very good choice that we have  done,  as  Government,  to  appoint  Maria.
[Applause.]

                            NATIONAL HEALTH BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, hon members, it is my  pleasure  to  be
presenting to you one of the most important pieces  of  legislation  in  the
health sector. I am sure you will agree that, given  the  divisions  of  the
past, the values of equity, justice and human dignity are essential  to  the
establishment of a fair, just and credible  health  system  that  cares  for
all.

The Bill deals with matters that require uniformity across  the  nation  and
provides norms, standards and framework for health service delivery and  the
implementation of a national health policy. A key feature  of  the  Bill  is
that it is embedded in the Constitution. The Bill sets the  patient  at  the
centre of the national health system. It creates a  national  health  system
that sets out governance structures across all  spheres  of  Government.  It
reinforces the primary health-care approach to health service  delivery.  It
creates a framework for both public  and  private  health  sectors  to  work
closely together to achieve a common vision  of  a  national  health  system
and, most importantly, it lays the  foundation  for  equity  in  the  health
sector.

One of the primary concerns and a theme that runs  throughout  the  Bill  is
the issue of quality. In the context of  health  services,  quality  is  not
just something that is nice to have - it must  be  an  integral  part  of  a
system. A health-care system that does not meet  certain  minimum  standards
of quality in service is simply not health care. Since  the  Bill  is  quite
long, I am  not  going  to  discuss  each  chapter  in  detail  because  the
portfolio committee did this work. Rather, I will point out to you  the  key
principles within the chapters.

Firstly, let me say that each of the  chapters  cover  a  critical  area  of
successful health service delivery -  notably,  the  rights  and  duties  of
users  and  providers  of  health  services;  the  national  provincial  and
municipal structures that  must  ensure  the  provision  of  such  services;
health establishments; human resources;  the  control  and  use  of  various
types of human tissue;  health  research,  evaluation  and  monitoring;  and
mechanisms to ensure compliance with its provisions.

The first chapter acknowledges and elaborates upon the broad objects of  the
Bill and the  constitutional  obligations  of  the  Government  to  protect,
respect, promote and fulfil the constitutional rights  that  involve  access
to health services. It sets out the roles and responsibilities of the  three
different spheres of Government to ensure the provision of  health  services
and allows for the Minister of Health to prescribe  conditions  under  which
categories of persons are eligible for certain free health services.

The second chapter deals with the rights  of  users  and  providers.  Users'
rights to have full knowledge of their health status and  treatment  and  to
consent to or refuse treatment are acknowledged and emphasised in the  Bill,
including the right not to be refused emergency medical  treatment.  Chapter
2 seeks to protect users concerning health information  and  health  records
and to ensure that no  one  has  unauthorised  access  to  sensitive  health
information. Health  information  is  personal  to  all  of  us  and  it  is
important that there are safeguards in  place  to  prevent  its  abuse.  The
chapter further seeks to empower users so that they themselves  promote  the
quality and standard of health services, by making provision  for  a  system
for the laying of complaints.

We have also frequently heard of our health-care professionals, who work  so
hard and sacrifice so much, who have been abused and mistreated by  patients
and families. The chapter entrenches the rights of providers to  be  treated
with dignity and respect. Chapters 3 and 4 set  out  the  functions  of  the
national  and  provincial  departments  of  health  respectively   and   the
structures that must be in place to ensure  the  delivery  of  health  care.
Both  chapters  balance  the  Constitutional  requirements  of  co-operative
government on the one hand and the distinct  separate  identities  of  three
different spheres of Government on the other.

For this reason, the national and provincial health councils established  by
the Bill are advisory bodies only. It is the responsibility of the  Minister
at national level and the MECs at provincial level to  make  health  policy.
Provision is also made in these two  chapters  for  consultative  forums  to
meet at both national and provincial level at least once a  year  so  as  to
ensure that there is significant interaction ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, there is a problem.  You
are not being heard. I just want to check the system quickly.  Can  we  also
ask members to pay attention to the Minister's speech? We are just  checking
the system quickly. Please proceed, hon Minister.

The Minister of Health: Provision is also made in  these  two  chapters  for
consultative forums to meet at both national and provincial levels at  least
once a year so as to ensure  that  there  is  significant  interaction  with
relevant stakeholders on issues that affect them.

The preparation of national and provincial health plans covering  strategic,
medium-term and human resources matters is mandated.  Our  health  plan  has
been based on the PHC approach that has been endorsed by  the  World  Health
Organisation  and  adopted  by  many  countries.  We  recently  had  a  very
successful conference celebrating 25 years of the Alma  Ata  Declaration  on
Primary Health Care. It is therefore fitting at this time in the history  of
the health sector that chapter 5 establishes a  district  health  system  as
the foundation for primary health care.

Although many municipalities are still  finding  their  feet  and  there  is
still work to be done with regard to the building of  capacity  and  funding
of the different roles  of  different  types  of  municipalities,  the  Bill
envisages an end point where most municipalities will be  providing  primary
health-care services in accordance with the national health policy.

Let me now turn to the process of planning and  development  in  the  health
sector. Prior to 1994, the process of planning  in  the  health  sector  was
virtually nonexistent or, at least, it was geared  towards  planning  first-
class health services for  a  privileged  few  only,  thus  maintaining  the
apartheid  policy  of  the  previous  government.  This  resulted   in   the
fragmentation and  unnecessary  duplication  of  services.  This  irrational
planning process has not only had an impact on the users but  the  providers
as well.

Chapter 6, therefore, is a very important chapter as it seeks to ensure  and
promote  improved  access  to  health  services.  It  does  this  through  a
certificate-of-need process, which is  a  rational  planning  tool  that  is
designed to promote good organisation, efficiency,  and  effectiveness,  and
prevent unnecessary duplication  of  health-care  facilities  and  services,
unlike what Mr  Gous  said.  It  will  guide  the  establishment  of  health
facilities and health services that best serve public needs.

Our objective is to  provide  health  services  of  the  same  standard  and
quality to all. I need to stress that the  certificate-of-need  process  not
only protects the users,  but  it  also  protects  the  providers  as  well.
Multiple providers cannot survive in a saturated market,  hence  a  rational
planning tool such as the certificate of need will ensure that services  are
delivered according to need. Similar systems  operate  successfully  in  the
United States and Italy, to name but  two  countries.  The  very  great  and
disparate health needs in South Africa dictate  that  we  cannot  afford  to
permit an oversupply of resources in some areas at the expense of others.

There  is  great  agreement  that  human  resources  are  one  of  the  most
critically important areas in the health  sector.  This  is  an  issue  that
countries throughout the world are grappling with. This was  highlighted  at
the World Health Organisation Conference  of  the  African  region  that  we
recently hosted. Chapter 7 covers the critically important  areas  of  human
resources for the health sector.

Provision is made in this chapter for many different  kinds  of  regulations
that can be written to address the many and varying aspects of health  human
resources that we encounter every  day.  These  aspects  include  retention,
education and training of health-care personnel, strategies of  recruitment,
and identification of shortages of key skills,  expertise  and  competencies
within the national health system, so that we can  work  together  with  the
educational sector to address these.

The chapter also allows the Minister of Health,  in  consultation  with  the
Minister of  Education,  to  establish  academic  health  complexes  at  the
various levels of the health system for training and research  purposes.  An
important policy principle addressed in this chapter  is  the  establishment
of the Forum of Statutory Health Council as a statutory body. There  already
is such a forum, but it was important to give it formal recognition in  this
Bill in order for it to play a more meaningful role. It has been  beefed  up
with community, departmental and educational representatives.

The forum has been given statutory powers so that it can be a  force  to  be
reckoned with in calling the statutory health councils to account for  their
performance as public authorities. Its  work  includes  the  monitoring  and
setting of performance improvement targets, protecting the interests of  the
public and users, acting as an ombudsperson for complaints about  particular
councils and advising me on matters that cut  across  two  or  more  of  the
statutory health professions.

Chapter 8 deals with the  replacement  of  Human  Tissue  Act  of  1985.  It
regulates who may acquire, use, supply and  store  human  tissue,  including
blood,  organs  and  gametes  and  for  what  purposes.  The  World   Health
Organisation has stated that it is very  important  that  countries  have  a
single  national  blood  transfusion  service  for  a  number  of  different
reasons. In these days of lethal blood-borne diseases such as  HIV/Aids  and
the haemorrhagic fevers, it is critical that we  ensure  the  integrity  and
safety of the nation's blood  supply.  A  single  supplier  is  more  easily
monitored and regulated especially concerning quality  and  the  observation
of prescribed standards and procedures.

A fragmented service increases the possibility of service gaps where  people
in outlying areas can be underserved because  it  is  uneconomical,  from  a
business perspective, to operate there.  It  is  important  to  ensure  that
there is no competition between blood suppliers as  this  compromises  blood
safety and that economies of scale in this area are optimised. This  chapter
also  covers  the  very  controversial   aspect   of   human   cloning.   It
distinguishes between  cloning  for  two  different  purposes.  Cloning  for
reproductive purposes is  prohibited  for  a  number  of  reasons  that  are
internationally recognised.

The right to human dignity  is  inextricably  bound  up  with  who  we  are,
including our physical make-up. Reproductive cloning strikes  at  the  heart
of our physical identity and our value as individual human  beings.  Cloning
for therapeutic purposes can be permitted in terms of the chapter, but  only
in restricted circumstances. We do not want to create  a  market  for  human
tissue in this country. It has always been reprehensible to us as a  society
that people should be made to trade in human tissue as though  it  was  just
another scarce commodity. It is a  matter  of  recognising  the  fundamental
value of  a  human  being  and  human  life.  There  is  the  potential  for
exploitation of the poor, for unethical and morally unacceptable  practices,
involving human embryos and there is a significant  proliferation  in  human
tissue  markets.  Therapeutic  cloning  must  therefore,  of  necessity,  be
carefully regulated.

Chapter 9 deals with national health research,  monitoring  and  evaluation.
As Government, we cannot make meaningful policy decisions concerning  health
services if we do  not  have  sound  information  upon  which  to  base  our
decisions. It is important, in order to effectively and efficiently  address
the  needs  of  our  people,  that  we  identify  national  health  research
priorities so that the scarce funds are spent  in  areas  where  people  can
derive the greatest benefit. It is important to protect people who are  used
as subjects in health research, given the potential for  their  exploitation
and the  importance  of  human  dignity  within  our  legal  system.  It  is
especially important to protect our children in this area. It is  a  serious
indictment of South African society that they are one  of  the  most  abused
and exploited sectors of our population and we cannot allow them  to  become
just another commodity in the health research setting.

This chapter establishes  a  national  ethics  committee  whose  job  is  to
identify and prioritise areas of  public  health  research  and  ensure  the
focus on priority health  problems.  The  National  Health  Research  Ethics
Council is established to ensure that all health conduct in South Africa  is
of an acceptable ethical standard and to act against those who do  not  have
sufficient respect for established ethical norms, standards  and  guidelines
in health research. Provision is made in this chapter for a national  health
information system which is based on information coming from provincial  and
district health levels.

Let me now turn  to  the  important  issue  of  compliance,  monitoring  and
evaluation. Too often, we see good  pieces  of  legislation  being  rendered
ineffectual because of lack of capacity to enforce  compliance.  Chapter  10
of the Bill  gives  it  teeth.  It  creates  structures  at  provincial  and
national level to ensure compliance with the provisions  of  the  Bill.  The
director-general must establish the office of  standards  compliance  within
the national Department of Health. It plays an important role  not  only  in
ensuring compliance with the certificate of need provisions and  conditions,
but also in monitoring and evaluating and promoting the  quality  of  health
services throughout the country. Every province must  have  an  inspectorate
for health establishments that  must  monitor  and  evaluate  compliance  by
health establishments and agencies within the province. It is the  intention
that these inspectorates will work in co-operation with the national  office
of standards compliance on areas of common interest  to  ensure  a  national
health system that is safe, effective and accessible to all.

Chapter 11 provides for regulations to  be  made  in  many  important  areas
involving health services. The regulation of the health sector is a  complex
and intricate business because the health sector itself  is  a  dynamic  and
developing environment.  For  this  reason,  it  is  neither  advisable  nor
appropriate to make provision for every matter in the  Bill  itself.  Hence,
the Minister may, in terms of chapter 11, make regulations  on  communicable
diseases, health research, health technology,  emergency  medical  services,
rehabilitation, human resource development and other matters.

Chapter 12 is the final chapter of the  Bill.  It  allows  the  Minister  to
appoint advisory and technical committees that are necessary to achieve  the
objectives of the Bill. It also allows for the assignment of the duties  and
delegation of powers by the director-general and myself  to  other  persons.
The legislation that  will  be  repealed  by  the  Bill  is  listed  in  the
schedule. The main laws that will be repealed are the Health  Act  of  1977,
the Health Tissue Act of 1983, the National Policy for Health  Act  of  1990
and the Academic Health Centres Act of 1993.

We have taken a long time to present this Bill before you today. As you  can
see, the Bill is complex. I believe that there are benefits in  taking  time
to do a thing properly. I can assure you that, in the  true  spirit  of  the
ANC, consultation on this Bill has  been  extensive.  We  did  our  best  to
accommodate the concerns  of  many  stakeholders,  even  though  there  were
sometimes conflicting interests.

In conclusion, I would like to  thank  the  portfolio  committee  for  their
active participation in strengthening the Bill. In particular, I would  like
to thank Comrade James Ngculu, the  Chairperson,  for  his  able  leadership
during the deliberations, and of course, the ANC for its progressive  health
policies whose aim is to provide better health for  all  South  Africans.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, the objective of the National Health  Bill,  to
provide a framework for  a  structured  uniform  health  system  which  will
redress the socioeconomic  injustices,  imbalances  and  inequities  of  the
past, is indeed a noble one.

The reality, however, is that the Bill in its present  form  fails  to  meet
the intended objectives as it lacks tangible, coherent  and  concrete  plans
to address past and existing inequities in the system.

Structures, standards and mechanisms to regulate  the  health-care  industry
dominate the Bill in a manner that is quite punitive to the private  sector.
The Department of Health lacks the capacity to sustain  all  that  the  Bill
envisages.

The Bill gives the Minister too much power, so much so that she  is  both  a
referee and a player in the same game.

It  would  appear  that,  in  her  haste  for  some  glory  before  she   is
unceremoniously dumped in the next  election,  the  Minister  of  Health  is
presenting us with legislation that is fatally flawed.

The South African Government has a history  of  taking  failed  policies  of
other countries and implementing it. The certificate of need is  a  case  in
point. In the early seventies, 38 states  in  the  United  States  used  the
certificate of need. It failed, because it was anti-competitive  and  unduly
regulatory in nature.

There appears to be a specific need and express purpose on the part  of  the
Minister to regulate the private industry, yet private sector  participation
in the process has been inadequate. While the  principle  of  levelling  the
playing fields  is  understood,  the  manner  in  which  it  is  being  done
restricts freedom of economic activity, stifles free competition and  smacks
very much of the old Group Areas  Act,  which  controlled  where  groups  of
people could stay and trade. Why can positive  incentives  not  be  used  to
achieve an even distribution of services in rural areas?

The state is both  the  allocator  and  competitor  when  it  comes  to  the
certificate of need. It grants itself  the  certificate  when  it  comes  to
public health establishments. Now, how equitable is that?

The reality is that most patients go  to  a  practitioner  of  choice.  Many
travel to do so. Many of you sitting here also do that. It is the  right  of
the consumer to choose a service  provider,  and  the  certificate  of  need
erodes that choice. Furthermore, how can continuity of care  be  ensured  if
the Director-General of Health does not re-issue a certificate of need?

The director-general will be awarding the certificate of need.  This  person
will surely have to  be  blessed  with  superhuman  powers  to  be  able  to
determine geographical reach and the size of  a  supporting  base  from  his
office in Pretoria. Furthermore, has the impact  of  the  lack  of  services
where the certificate of need is not granted been considered?  The  Bill  is
also quite silent on what happens during the appeal process.

The criteria for granting a certificate of need  is  not  specified  in  the
Bill. We are told it will  be  in  the  regulations.  Now,  that  is  highly
problematic because too much has been deferred  to  the  regulations,  which
have yet to be published. The result of this is a lack of  clear  guidelines
on the legislation. Furthermore, the legislation is dependent on  regulation
in order to be effectively implemented.

It is highly regrettable  that  the  Minister  is  so  insistent  about  the
certificate of need. It is a most inappropriate regulatory measure,  and  it
is certainly going to accelerate the exit of highly competent and  qualified
health-care professionals from South Africa.  A  World  Health  Organisation
report released on Wednesday claimed that 58% of health  workers  wanted  to
leave South Africa mostly because of the deterioration  of  the  health-care
system. It is also going to act as a disincentive  to  the  private  health-
care sector to invest in health care in South  Africa  and,  therefore,  the
objects of the Bill cannot and will not be realised. Co-existence is  surely
the answer and the certificate of need antagonises the private sector.

There are sure to  be  two  major  consequences  of  this  legislation  five
minutes after the  ink  dries.  Firstly,  there  will  be  a  constitutional
challenge. I doubt, however, that this bothers  the  Minister,  as  she  has
already proved to be so incompetent in her portfolio, and the  precedent  of
the health of South Africa being decided  by  litigation  has  already  been
set. Furthermore, she openly defies court orders  and  no  action  is  taken
against her. So she will clap hands childishly and go on her  merry  way  in
blissful ignorance.

Secondly, amendments will be proposed and this Bill will be back here  again
very soon. Quite frankly, I cannot wait to say ``I told  you  so''  because,
indeed, caution has been thrown to the wind.

The National Health Bill in its current format will not meet the  main  goal
to transform health in  South  Africa.  It  is  vague  and  unclear  on  how
implementation  will  actually  improve  access  to  quality  health   care.
Furthermore, it does not provide an enabling framework or system to  address
management of the huge crisis that  faces  South  Africa,  namely  HIV/Aids.
While I do  acknowledge  that  general  legislation  does  not  address  the
management of a specific disease, the truth is that the Aids  pandemic  will
and is already having a devastating impact  on  the  health-care  system  in
South Africa. Instead of catering for this, the Bill  hides  behind  cop-out
phrases like health services will be provided "within available  resources".
What that really translates into is that treatment for HIV/Aids will not  be
provided because the budget is inadequate.

What the Minister should actually do is look  at  tried-and-tested  ways  of
improving health care in South Africa instead  of  advocating  potato  salad
solutions.

The DA cannot, in the best interest of good health in South Africa,  support
this Bill. [Interjections.]

In conclusion, I wish to place on record sincere thanks to  the  chairperson
and the committee for the manner and the spirit in which we engaged on  this
Bill and, also, the DA would  like  to  extend  good  wishes  to  Dr  Ayanda
Ntsaluba, the former DG of Health. We wish you well in your new position.

Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L V J NGCULU: Thank you very much, Chairperson. As the ANC we want,  from
the outset, to declare our unqualified support for this Bill.

This Bill marks a fundamental break with the past. The National Health  Bill
radically moves away from the backward and parochial  1977  Health  Act.  As
did Moses, this Bill will also take the health system of our country to  the
promised  land  of  equity  and  equality,  efficiency  and   quality,   and
accelerate the long road to a better life for all.

The 1977 Health Act completely ignored the issues of access and equity,  but
focused more on milk sheds and the animal feeding system.  The  Bill  before
us, therefore, seeks to transform the entire health system in South Africa.

The Bill is embedded in the Constitution. It responds to the  injunction  of
the Constitution to address the injustices,  imbalances  and  inequities  of
the past that require that the state take reasonable legislative  and  other
measures,  within  available   resources,   to   achieve   the   progressive
realisation of the right of the people of South Africa  to  have  access  to
health-care services.

In this regard, the Bill states in no uncertain terms that  no  one  may  be
refused emergency medical treatment. This is reflected in the  Constitution.
This provision indeed responds in particular to a situation in which  people
who do not have medical aid or financial standing  are  simply  turned  away
and  not  attended  to  during  an  emergency,  on  the   basis   of   their
socioeconomic status.

Some people have argued that we should,  therefore,  define  `emergency'  in
the Bill, but our view as the portfolio committee is  that  it  is  not  our
duty to interpret the Constitution. Our duty is to protect  the  people  and
allow them access to health in conditions of emergency.

The DA strenuously opposed this position on the basis that this  will  be  a
disincentive to private-sector  investment.  They  further  stated  that  we
should  specify  categories.  We   stated   in   the   portfolio   committee
deliberations, and we do so here again, that our responsibility  is  to  the
people of South Africa, particularly the poor and the vulnerable.

We  are  saying  that  in  emergencies  people  must   get   attention   and
stabilisation without regard to monetary gain, because  the  health  of  the
people should come before anything  else.  We  requested  the  DA  to  state
whether, as it stands, it has no regard for the poor  and  marginalised  and
is more interested in the interests of the rich and the private sector.  The
answer was as confused as their intervention again shows in this debate.

Another important element in this Bill is that it entrenches the  rights  of
patients and facilitates service delivery. In  this  regard,  it  guarantees
that the user must have full knowledge of his or her  health  status  except
in circumstances where there is substantial  evidence  that  the  disclosure
would be contrary to the best interest of the user. The  user  must  consent
to  the  health  services  provided  and  his  or  her  confidentiality   is
guaranteed  in  terms  of  this  legislation.  It  specifies  instances   of
departure from this provision.

Even more critical is the provision and  procedure  to  lay  complaints.  We
have proposed again here  that  such  procedures  and  information  must  be
clearly stipulated in the health  establishments.  Here  we  would  like  to
stress that we have seen too many instances where people have  been  treated
in the most objectionable way and thus  their  confidence  in  the  services
Government provides them is simply eroded.

Throughout this Bill our  particular  emphasis  on  the  user's  rights  and
duties is unambiguous. We once more want to ask the people who stand in  the
way of the poor and the vulnerable in relation to health, as to  where  they
stand in relation to the issue of the poor  and  vulnerable,  such  as  when
Thozama Ngongo, on 14 August 2003, went to a hospital in  the  Western  Cape
and waited 17 hours before she could be attended. Even  when  attended,  the
procedure was performed without anaesthetic, causing her extreme pain.  When
the hospital staff were asked about this, they stated in  the  most  callous
manner that she did not complain.

We have referred this matter to the Minister of Health. However,  the  point
we're emphasising here is that this legislation is aimed at putting  a  stop
to all practices of this nature.

The National Health Bill shall ensure that  people  like  Thozama  and  many
others like her shall never again become victims of the  most  uncaring  and
cruel system at the hands of the people who are supposed to be providers  of
quality health care.
The other important provision of  this  Bill  is  that  it  establishes  the
district health system and district health councils. In this  way  the  Bill
strives to achieve  equity,  overcome  fragmentation  and  duplication,  and
introduces better integration. It states that the  district  health  council
must promote co-operative governance and ensure co-ordination  of  planning,
budgeting, provisioning and monitoring of all health  services  that  affect
residents of the district for which the council was established; that  every
metropolitan  and  district  municipality  must  ensure   that   appropriate
municipal health services are effectively and equitably  provided  in  their
respective areas.

Again,  this  is  a  significant  departure  from  the   fragmentation   and
duplication that were promoted by  the  1977  Health  Act,  which  permitted
national, provincial and local government to duplicate services.  This  does
away with such duplication and fragmentation and streamlines everything.

The Bill allocates environmental health services to municipalities with  the
exception  of  port  health,  malaria  and  hazardous  substances.  It  also
envisages a situation where  primary  health  care  shall  be  delegated  to
certain categories of municipalities, such as metropolitans and districts.

Mindful of varying capacities at local level, this Bill shall allocate  such
resources on the basis of service-level agreements.  This  is  a  huge  step
forward for the organisation of primary health  care,  which  is  the  basic
`plank' of our health system.

Another significant proposition in the Bill is the issue of the  certificate
of need. It  prohibits  the  establishment,  construction,  modification  or
acquiring of a health  establishment,  or  increasing  the  number  of  beds
without the possession of the certification of need.

Some among us have strenuously opposed this section in the Bill. Before  one
deals with the contents of this opposition, one would like to first  explain
the aims and objectives of the certificate of need.

The  certificate  of  need  is  designed  to  address  the  trend   of   the
inappropriate  establishment  of  health  establishments,  particularly  the
unbridled proliferation in the private  sector,  which  in  turn  duplicates
services. Such  a  duplication  and  unbridled  proliferation  inadvertently
leads to pushing up the cost of medical care.

The certificate of need seeks, therefore, to promote  cost  containment.  It
is always important to remember that any health  system  must  look  at  the
question of cost, quality and access, and the state has a responsibility  to
progressively meet the health needs of the population. In other  words,  the
certificate of need should be seen as part of Government policy  to  achieve
efficiency in the public health.

The certificate of need, therefore, is another  intervention  of  redressing
the imbalances of the past  and  seeks  to  achieve  a  fair  and  equitable
distribution of services to where they are needed.

Some, in their opposition to this provision, even called the certificate  of
need another form of pass laws or Group Areas Act. People who never  carried
a passbook and who were the beneficiaries of Group Areas Act say this.  They
deliberately forget to remember that the skewed distribution  of  resources,
including health provisioning,  is  but  a  consequence  of  the  iniquitous
system of apartheid.

When we try to correct this imbalance, which favours a particular class  and
race, in order to arrive at a  rational  and  fair  distribution  of  health
services, some people have the gall to protest.

The hon Ruth Rabinowitz of the IFP even called on us not to regulate on  the
basis of the certificate of need and should rather leave this to the  market
forces. I am not sure what the IFP members would say, those who live in far-
flung areas where they have to walk distances in order to get their  health-
care services. Would they agree with hon Rabinowitz's call to leave  health-
care service to chance, in other words, "tata ma chance, tata ma health?"  I
strongly doubt that she speaks on their behalf. [Laughter.].

We, however, would like to once more stress to all those who are opposed  to
this provision that as the ANC we cannot govern on the basis of  chance.  We
are a caring Government that always puts people first. We entertained  about
twenty oral submissions and many written submissions. People who made  their
submissions supported the broad principles of  the  Bill.  We  have  in  our
deliberations accommodated many of  the  views  and  suggestions  that  were
made. We wish, therefore, to thank all those who made the effort to join  in
the making of history in South Africa.

I would also like to thank the Portfolio Committee on Health for the  manner
in which we dealt with the Bill. Even though at some point we  differed,  we
never lost sight of the singular importance of  this  Bill.  We  also  would
like to thank the research staff for the way in which they  provided  backup
support to the committee.

Our thanks also go to the Department of  Health,  to  the  former  director-
general in particular, and to the Ministry for steering  this  Bill  to  its
logical conclusion.

We are indeed very happy that by the time we go to the 10th  anniversary  of
freedom, the 1977 Health Act will have been  consigned  to  the  dustbin  of
history. Throughout the history of the ANC, we've never  hesitated  to  take
bold decisions, especially  when  those  decisions  were  designed  for  the
betterment of the lives of the people. The National Health Bill  is  another
illustration of our resolve to transform and change our society.

When the next generations look at this Bill, a Bill  we  are  certain  shall
endure posterity, they will cherish those of us who  had  the  foresight  to
champion this legislation.

Once more, the ANC supports this Bill. We have indeed come  full  circle.  I
am certain that the doctors who served the  ANC  in  the  camps  in  Angola,
doctors like Dr Nomava Ntshangase, Peter Mfelang and  medical  officers  who
served with them and are no more, would be proud that we remained  steadfast
on our road to a better South Africa. We have not failed  their  ideals.  We
support this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Chairperson, the hon chairperson of  health  is  absolutely
wrong. Neither the IFP nor have I ever advocated a free market in health  or
persons taking their chances in health care. We advocate minimum  standards,
accountable  and  efficient  services  and  decentralisation,  rather   than
control.

However, democracy is alive and well in  the  health  committee.  Under  the
able chairmanship of Mr Ngculu the committee paid heed to  every  submission
brought before it. Many concerns were addressed.

The admin staff were superb, the advisers competent and helpful. So  why  is
the IFP so disappointed in the National Health Bill? Because  it  is  a  law
reviewed by a great team in the service of a  facile  dream,  which  may  in
reality become a perfect nightmare. The IFP would have  preferred  to  usher
in a health Bill that would lead us to greener pastures.

The viewpoints I am representing are not those of the private sector or  the
large health conglomerates that dominate the health industry, nor  are  they
the views expressed by health practitioners in the leafy  suburbs  of  South
Africa. I am representing the views of people in rural and  outlying  areas,
who are tired of the poor health services  they  receive.  I  represent  the
views of hard-working doctors in outlying rural areas,  who  give  excellent
services to their patients, some prescribing  and  treating  for  remarkably
low prices.

The wealthy institutions made no representation on this Bill.  The  hospital
association made a muted one. They can pay their way through  this  maze.  I
represent millions who believe  in  accountable,  reasonably  priced  health
services, and people  who  believe  that  democracy  means  the  freedom  to
choose.

We all know what the National Health Bill needs to do. It needs  to  reverse
the overspending of health on the  world's  rich  and  the  neglect  of  the
world's poor. We need the same restructuring in South Africa.

There are two opposite responses to such unbalanced  services.  One  is  the
tried and failed method of control and bureaucracy: Control  every  drop  of
health spend and then try and force it into channels where we want  it.  The
other is the more flexible, realistic and effective approach, which the  IFP
favours.

Firstly, accept the money offered to us by the rich  nations  of  the  world
and  use  it  accountably;  secondly,  minimise  the  bureaucracy;  thirdly,
actually spend a high percentage of public money  on  the  rural  and  urban
poor. Government can contract top-quality care to serve rural  and  deprived
areas, with competitive contracts to NGOs and private  consortia;  fourthly,
implement functional rural development plans; fifth, draw  health  personnel
through incentives to the areas where they are needed  and  encourage  well-
motivated medics from all over the world, not  just  Cuba,  to  visit  South
Africa and work for  the  poor;  sixth,  decentralise  authority  and  allow
flexibility, and seventh, appoint objective health ombudspersons  to  ensure
that minimum standards are maintained  in  all  private  and  public  health
establishments.

This Bill applies the certificate of need. Aptly, the acronym is  a  con  to
all health services  in  South  Africa.  We've  seen  it  before,  affecting
dispensing doctors and people who want to buy medicine, but this applies  it
across the board.

Through the certificate of  need,  the  director-general  will  attempt  to,
amongst other things, correct inequities based  on  race,  gender,  economic
and  geographic  factors;  promote  the  correct   mix   of   private/public
partnerships;  measure  the  potential  advantages  and  disadvantages   for
existing   establishments;   attempt   to    establish    demographic    and
epidemiological  characteristics  of  the  population  to  be  served,   the
potential benefits to research and the probable financial sustainability  of
the health establishment.

Our new director-general will need to be a fortune teller, in addition to  a
diviner of all possible health truths.  The  cost  of  setting  up  such  an
operation will be astronomical, and this will be money  directed  away  from
the very services that are needed. It would, in any case,  be  a  long  time
before  our  country  could  boast  of  such  a  system,  and   until   then
subjectivity  and  fairness,  legal  challenges,  mistakes  and  a  host  of
unintended consequences will be the order of the day.

Even after a practitioner has passed the  qualifying  exam  and  obtained  a
licence to practice from the respective council, and paid  the  registration
fee, the certificate may or may not  be  granted  by  the  director-general.
This key need certificate would be as much  an  invitation  to  bribery  and
corruption as honey to a bee. The appeal mechanism  for  this  process  need
not exist, as the appeal against the director-general goes to the  Minister.


Not only does this apply to the  private  sector,  but  also  to  provincial
MECs. Talk of decentralisation, yet introduce this form  of  centralisation.
We support the decentralisation of district  health  services  in  practice,
not only in word.

The  Bill  also  provides  for  numerous  new  bodies  and  committees  with
duplication of responsibility and the creation of yet more  bureaucracy.  On
none of these is  there  explicit  reference  to  traditional  healer,  NGO,
academic, or private representation. The Minister can override their  advice
with her unfair discretionary powers, and she has virtual carte  blanche  to
appoint members to committees or to terminate their services.

Another major feature of the Health Bill is  the  regulation  of  stem  cell
research. This new field of biogenics challenges our  understanding  of  the
soul, the meaning of life and the difference  between  humans  and  animals.
When one can carry a container filled with hundreds of frozen  zygotes  that
are potential human beings, from one  continent  to  another,  or  when  one
considers the setting  up  of  factories  to  farm  human  embryos  for  the
development of body parts and ideal babies,  the  matter  becomes  food  for
serious ethical consideration.

The Bill makes the  Minister  the  soul  judge  of  what  research  will  be
licensed, and no  minister,  whether  she  be  Manto  Tshabalala  or  Mother
Theresa, should be given such power.

Ethical considerations are a critical factor in the future of  health  care.
But, unfortunately, the history  of  ethics  in  the  South  African  health
policy has left much to  be  desired.  This  Bill  encourages,  rather  than
curbs,  questionable  practices  in  future.  Even  donor  funding  for  the
provinces goes through the filter of  the  Ministers  or  MECs  for  health,
nationally and provincially.

If the debacle of the global fund did not warn us of  the  dangers  of  such
controls, then we are naive dreamers who believe that politicians  only  use
power for the public  good.  Reality  teaches  us  otherwise.  The  National
Health Bill legislates undemocratic practices that expose the  public  to  a
health system open to corruption, mismanagement and  further  deterioration.
It is with regret that the IFP cannot support it.

Dr S J GOUS: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  National  Health  Bill  has  been
eagerly awaited and is long overdue. It is a very necessary and  commendable
piece of legislation that seeks to establish a  legislative  and  regulatory
framework for the delivery of health services throughout South  Africa.  The
NNP accepts most of the  measures  and  structures  as  proposed  to  effect
implementation and delivery of  uniform  health  services,  except  the  so-
called certificate of need, the big CON.

Unfortunately, this is such a  fundamental  concept  that  the  NNP  had  to
consider its support  for  this  legislation  as  a  whole,  based  on  this
certificate of need. Now the question is: What is this certificate of  need?
Clause 36 states that a person may not: (a) establish, construct, modify  or
acquire a health establishment or a health agency; (b) increase  the  number
of  beds  in,  or  acquire  prescribed  health  technology   at   a   health
establishment or health agency; (c) provide prescribed  health  services  or
continue to operate a  health  establishment  or  health  agency  after  the
expiration of 24 months from the date this Act took  effect,  without  being
in possession of the certificate of need.

When you consider the definition  of  a  health  establishment,  it  becomes
clear that this certificate of need will affect everyone  from  the  biggest
corporate business, public and  private,  to  the  individual  practitioner,
which will, by the way, include the nurse who wishes to do  voluntary  home-
based care.  Let's  also  not  forget  that  this  certificate  of  need  is
renewable and this has to be implemented within 24 months  of  the  date  of
this piece of legislation taking effect. Indeed, there is a big task ahead.

The NNP accepts the principle that health services may be regulated  by  way
of licensing or accreditation. But we cannot  support  the  principle  of  a
certificate of need. The certificate of need  is  based  on  poorly  defined
criteria and could eventually lead  to  subjective  or  political  decisions
that do not adequately respect the rights of an individual.

The  motivation  for  the  certificate   of   need   is   to   address   the
maldistribution of health workers and facilities, especially  in  the  rural
areas. We believe that it will not have the desired  outcome  and  we  would
rather support a system of incentives.

There is a possibility that such a measure would also  encourage  the  brain
drain and have  an  overall  negative  effect  on  the  health  system.  The
constitutionality of this certificate of need also needs to be confirmed.

The NNP's opposition to this measure  is  shared  by  the  majority  of  the
inputs at the hearing on the National Health Bill. It  is  clear  that  this
certificate   of   need   is   arbitrary,   subjective,   destructive    and
anticompetitive.

The NNP predicts that it will have the opposite of the intended  effect  and
will be the grease on the slide of the brain drain. This is confirmed in  no
uncertain terms by the young doctors as represented  by  the  SA  Registrars
Association.  A  possible  positive  effect  could  have   been   that   the
certificate of need could have given  value  to  a  practice.  However,  the
certificate of need is granted to a person, which means that it lapses  when
the individual dies or leaves the practice for whatever reason.

Some  of  the  submissions  likened  the  certificate   of   need   to   the
reinstitution of the Group Areas Act, to influx control and the  pass  laws.
It could easily become the health workers' "dompas", as he or she  will  not
be allowed to practise his or her profession in a certain  area  of  his  or
her choice, whether that be based on personal, family, health or  any  other
considerations. The NNP finds this immoral and unacceptable.

Sections 21 and 22 of the Bill of Rights guarantee freedom of  movement  and
profession. This may be limited by section  36(1).  The  NNP  believes  that
section  36(1)(e)  would  be  applicable  as  there  are  surely  many  less
restrictive means to achieve this purpose.

Other clauses that the NNP is objecting to are those that  place  an  unfair
burden  on  an  individual,  for  which  he  is  not  primarily  trained  or
qualified.

The clause on record keeping is also contentious because  it  is  not  clear
for how long records should be kept. Regarding public  liability  insurance,
I need to know whether there is any legislation that prescribes  to  lawyers
how they must insure themselves. Why should health workers be  subjected  to
this?

Entry and search without a warrant  is  totally  unacceptable  to  the  NNP.
Another  worry  is  the   possible   duplication   of   complaints   against
professionals for whatever reason.

Lastly, regarding the issue of sunset or grandfather clauses, the NNP  finds
it morally unacceptable to jeopardise  the  youth's  future  for  short-term
gain. We must accept  that  this  is  groundbreaking  legislation,  and  new
legislation, and we are, therefore, bound to make  mistakes.  The  NNP  asks
that we admit to these mistakes sooner rather  than  later.  This  piece  of
legislation should be amended before it creates  havoc  and  destruction  in
sectors of the national health system.

In closing, I would like to thank our Chair, Mr James Ngculu,  for  the  way
he handled this very complex and difficult piece  of  legislation,  and  the
rest of the committee. I  also  wish  our  leaving  or  departing  Director-
General of the Department of Health, Dr Ntsaluba, all of  the  best  in  his
new career. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms N M  TWALA:  Madam  Speaker,  this  National  Health  Bill  represents  a
milestone in the ANC's endeavours to transform the health-care  system  into
one where the health system  will  benefit  everyone  equally,  but  with  a
special focus on the poor and the most vulnerable.

Our Freedom Charter is clear when  it  provides  us  with  a  benchmark  for
health. And,  as  ANC  members,  we  feel  we  are  mandated  to  develop  a
preventive health system which is run by the state; and, where free  medical
care and hospitalisation  are  provided  for  all,  with  special  care  for
mothers and young children. We believe we are still on  track  in  achieving
this goal.

Chapter 2 of this Bill, which deals with the rights of users and  duties  of
health-care providers, marks a fundamental step in restoring the dignity  of
the patient and providing fair treatment to all citizens  of  this  country,
irrespective of whether they come from urban or rural areas.

Another  far-reaching  measure  that  this   chapter   introduces   is   the
enforcement of emergency treatment  for  all,  in  the  delivery  of  health
services. What  this  means  is  that  no  health-care  provider  or  health
establishment  shall  ever  again  be  able  to  refuse   anyone   emergency
treatment. We shall remember the incident in 1996, in Khayelitsha,  where  a
patient was brought  for  treatment  on  a  wheelbarrow.  The  patient  died
without being attended to because they were sent from  pillar  to  post  and
health-care providers were more interested in rushing to get off duty.  This
will never happen again.

We heard, time after time, stakeholders asking, ``Who is going  to  pay  for
this emergency treatment and what exactly is an emergency treatment?''  But,
throughout the discussion, money was  the  main  concern,  with  hardly  any
discussion on saving the life of the individual who  is  unfortunate  enough
to need emergency treatment to save her life. The  ANC  was  clear  on  this
subject. Whichever health-service provider is at the scene of the  emergency
must take care of the patient who needs that treatment - whether  it  be  an
ambulance, local doctor, private hospital  or  a  clerk  at  the  admissions
office who wants to check the medical-aid number first.

Many of those who made laws in the past era never saw to  it  that  patients
were informed of the  benefits,  risks,  costs  and  consequences  generally
associated with each option. This was very  common  with  black  people,  in
general, and the uneducated, in  particular.  Our  people  never  knew  that
they, as patients, had the right to refuse health services or had the  right
to information about their treatment.

Umntu omnyama ubengakhathalelwa, engenalo  ilungelo  lokwazi  nokuzithethela
ngempilo  yakhe.  Bangaphi  oomama  abazibhaqa  sele  bekhutshwe   izibeleko
bengazange bacaciselwa ngaphambi kokuba kwenziwe oko nezizathu  ezenze  into
yokuba kufikelelwe kweso sigqibo? Isininzi sabo  yayingabantu  abamnyama  in
the  homelands. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The black people did not have rights and could  not  speak  for  themselves
and about their health. How many women have  had  hysterectomy,  removal  of
the uterus, without it being explained to them first?  A  majority  of  them
were women from the former homelands.]

I remember, when I was training as a nurse in King Edward VIII Hospital,  an
incident of a patient from KwaNongoma who had a  hysterectomy  done  without
her knowledge. She wondered why she could not conceive. It  was  only  after
attending an infertility clinic that she discovered that her womb  had  been
removed. Neither she nor her husband had given any consent.

With  this  Bill,  it  is  going  to  be  compulsory  that  the  user  fully
participates in any decision-making that affects his or her personal  health
treatment and it has to be done in a language that she  or  he  understands.
This Bill protects the patient, once they are discharged, by  ensuring  that
health-care providers or  nurses  and  doctors  issue  the  patient  with  a
discharge report. The health establishment would therefore be  compelled  to
give information such as the  follow-up  treatment,  recommended  medicines,
date of next visit and so on.

This initiative is taken because  we  have  seen  instances  where,  when  a
patient goes for his or her follow-up treatment, there  are  no  reports  on
their previous condition, what  treatment  was  given  and  what  subsequent
steps were to be taken. This is usually problematic when the patient  visits
another place and she or he has to begin the investigation all  over  again.
This could be costly and also detrimental to the patient's  life.  Moreover,
it contributes towards wasting the taxpayer's money.

In Frere Hospital, in East London, a patient was treated  for  serious  dog-
bite wounds. Her legal representative  could  not  proceed  with  the  court
action against the accused because the user's records  were  nowhere  to  be
found at the department where the  records  were  kept.  This  court  action
dragged  on  for  almost  two  years.  After  the  victim  had  come  to  my
constituency office for assistance, I contacted her lawyer who told me  that
that was not  the  only  case,  but  that  there  were  many  motor  vehicle
assurance cases, submitted as claims to the Road Accident  Fund,  that  were
backed up because  of  missing  records  from  the  same  hospital.  I  then
contacted the head of the hospital and the MEC. After four days the  records
were traced and the attorney was able to proceed with the case.

This legislation will make sure that hospitals and clinics  set  up  control
measures to prevent unauthorised access to those  records.  Any  person  who
changes or destroys a record without authority commits  an  offence  and  is
liable for conviction, a fine or imprisonment for  a  period  not  exceeding
one year, or both a fine and imprisonment.

This Bill will also enable any person, who wishes to lay a  complaint  about
the manner in which she or he was treated at a hospital or clinic,  to  have
the complaint investigated. These  measures  ensure  greater  accountability
towards the patient, but the patient, too, must adhere to the rules  of  the
health establishment when receiving treatment or using health  services.  We
hope that these complaint mechanisms will  be  introduced  as  a  matter  of
urgency.

Cosatu, during public  hearings,  alluded  to  the  fact  that  dignity  and
respect shall be restored with the implementation of this  Bill.  This  Bill
moves away from the narrow biomedical model, where a doctor is perceived  as
God, into a participatory health-care  model,  where  the  patient  has  the
right to be treated in a humane and dignified manner.

The ANC, once again, delivers to the people. As the ANC,  we  say,  ``Health
for all, dignity for all and quality services for all''.

Today, those in this House who oppose this Bill are doing that because  they
are opposed to the provision of a better life for  our  people.  It  clearly
shows that they have no interest in ensuring that our people  get  a  better
life in this country. Only the  ANC  stands  for  a  better  life  for  all.

Ms C DUDLEY: Deputy Speaker, since 1998 - when the ACDP submitted a  Private
Member's Bill with regard to the  prohibition  of  human  cloning  in  South
Africa, the ACDP has been calling on Government  to  urgently  reassess  the
need for a separate Bill prohibiting human cloning and the  use  of  embryos
for stem-cell research in South Africa.

We, therefore, welcome the inclusion of these issues in the National  Health
Bill which is, at last, before Parliament. However, while the Bill  includes
a prohibition on reproductive cloning of human beings, it allows for 14-day-
old foetuses to be used for research - which the ACDP  strenuously  opposes.
We are also concerned that the Bill offers insufficient  protection  against
therapeutic cloning, which involves the intentional creation  and  nurturing
of an embryo which is then sacrificed and cells are  harvested.  The  health
department officials, defending research done on  developing  human  beings,
said that it was justified because of the importance of its results but  did
not respond to whether or not they were  implying  that  the  importance  of
research then  justifies  the  use  of  human  beings  as  guinea  pigs  for
experimentation.

Of course, the department does not consider a developing human foetus  as  a
human being, especially before 14 days. And, provided that the  donor  gives
consent and research is documented, it is legal. Apart from  the  fact  that
nothing changes within 14 days from conception to make the foetus  any  more
or less a developing human being, this creates a market  for  foetuses,  and
cash-strapped people could consider this a new method of making money.
Since it is legal in South Africa for a developing  life  to  be  terminated
merely for convenience or economic reasons, or no particular reason at  all,
this approach is not surprising. In fact, once people  have  been  convinced
that 14 days is OK, why not 24 days or even  54  days;  and  then,  come  to
think of it, why not children under 2 years as, at least  one  academic  has
suggested that not even they are viable and should be expendable.

This Bill, unfortunately, does  not  give  the  much-needed  protection  and
further exposes women and unborn children to exploitation and abuse  in  the
name of science. At the same time, the issue of a certificate of need  is  a
concern because these clauses lack  clarity  and  create  uncertainty.  They
undermine constitutional rights currently enjoyed by licensed or  registered
members of  the  private  sector  and,  potentially,  undermine  health-care
services in general.

While the certificate of  need  applies  to  both  the  private  and  public
sectors, the Department of Health, as the responsible  regulator,  would  be
receiving and granting  applications  from  and  to  itself  while  actively
competing with the private sector. The director-general will decide  whether
or not a service can be provided  in  an  area  that  is  dependent  on  the
department's perception of the need. Gatesville, in Mitchells  Plain,  is  a
black-owned hospital and a case in point. The department has refused them  a
cath lab on the grounds that a city hospital has a cardiac  department  and,
therefore, they see no need for it. This is a blow to black empowerment  and
to the people of Mitchells Plain.

New restrictions on hospitals will allow for contracts of between 10 and  20
years. While this may inconvenience large hospitals, it will  not  adversely
affect  their  business.  Smaller  hospitals,  however,  will  have  shorter
periods over which to off-set costs and this, coupled with their  restricted
bargaining power, will cause prices to go up. That, in turn,  will  make  it
easier for them to be swallowed up by bigger hospitals.

The ACDP also queried clause 41(6)(d), which could be  used  against  health
establishments that refuse to perform medical functions that  they  consider
immoral, such as abortion. The department, however, insisted that  that  was
not the intention because providers still have the constitutional  right  to
refuse to do an abortion, but cautioned that, in terms  of  regulations,  it
is already a criminal offence to refuse to refer  a  person  to  a  facility
where they will get an abortion.

Clause 45 states that any person who performs any of the  acts  contemplated
in clause 41 without a certificate of need could commit an  offence  and  be
liable to a fine or imprisonment of five years. Churches,  NGOs  and  anyone
caring for people independently would need to qualify for a  certificate  of
need. And this could negatively affect thousands of people  who  give  vital
home-based care in a country so seriously affected by HIV/Aids.

While the ACDP has welcomed the National Health  Bill  in  principle,  as  a
vital piece of legislation that could potentially  improve  the  quality  of
life of people in South  Africa  and  increase  life  expectancy,  we  must,
regrettably, vote against the Bill primarily on these grounds. Thank you.

Ms N C NKABINDE: Deputy Speaker, hon Minister and hon members, the  core  of
this Bill is, perhaps,  best  captured  by  the  following  section  in  the
preamble, which sets the legislation out to:


  ...  establish  a  health  system  based  on  decentralised   management,
  principles  of  equity,  efficiency,  sound  governance,  internationally
  recognised standards of research and a spirit  of  enquiry  and  advocacy
  which encourages participation.

If this Bill can be implemented in  a  fashion  that  can  actually  achieve
these objectives, then surely we will  be  providing  the  people  of  South
Africa  with  the  health  care  that  they  deserve  under   a   democratic
dispensation. In fact,  I  dare  say  that  if  these  principles  had  been
consistently applied in the past five years, we  would  not  have  witnessed
the  continuous  and  damaging  uproar  over  the  management  of   HIV/Aids
treatment.

The Constitution demands not only extensive health-care provision, but  also
the progressive realisation of these rights. It is, therefore, correct  that
Chapters 1 and 2 set a clear benchmark of what  these  rights  are  and  the
duties of the administration, health-care professionals and  users  in  this
regard.

We express the hope that the provisions of Chapter 3  will  create  the  co-
operative and consultative  atmosphere  that  is  required  for  the  policy
environment to respond adequately and effectively to the  health-care  needs
and challenges of this  country.  The  role  of  the  National  Consultative
Health Forum requires further expansion, and it  is  hoped  that  this  body
will play a central role in shaping a policy.

The decentralised management of health-care described in Chapters  4  and  5
is, in our view, the correct approach. We are  hopeful  that  this,  indeed,
will lead to the resources and services reaching the people  at  grass-roots
level. It is absolutely vital  that  the  billions  of  rands  budgeted  for
health care every year are  actually  deployed  at  the  level  where  these
services are required. Only by doing  this  can  we  bring  an  end  to  the
deplorable situation where health-care facilities are constantly lacking  in
terms of medicines, basic supplies, equipment and adequate personnel.

The UDM supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  HEALTH:  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  Minister  and  hon
members, I'm very glad to be  able  to  participate  in  the  debate  today,
because an unusual situation has arisen in respect of the  consideration  of
the National Health Bill, in that I'm obliged to contextualise  my  position
on this important legislation  by  referring  upfront  to  the  co-operative
governance agreement between the ANC and the New NP, in  terms  of  which  I
serve in the national executive as the Deputy Minister of Health.

That agreement provides for the two parties concerned to seek  agreement  on
any matters of policy on which they  differ,  and  if  they  fail  to  reach
agreement, to respect the principle of the majority view, in this  case  the
ANC, prevailing whilst the New NP has the right to  hold  a  differing  view
and to express and promote that view publicly. The clear  intention  of  the
agreement is also, of course, that should such a difference arise,  it  must
be dealt with in a responsible and  positive  spirit.  The  National  Health
Bill is an example of such a difference of opinion,  which  now  has  to  be
dealt with.

Against this backdrop, I wish to say that the New NP is  supportive  of  the
broad objectives as outlined in the Bill, and fully recognises not only  the
socioeconomic injustices, imbalances and inequities of  health  services  of
the past, but the need  to  deal  with  them  with  vigour  and  commitment,
underpinned by a number of obligations which flow from the Constitution  and
from the Bill of Rights. We are  also  in  agreement  with  the  four  broad
objectives set out in the preamble of the Bill. However, it is  actually  on
the basis of the fourth objective set out, which I wish to  quote,  that  we
have identified problem areas,  the  most  important  being  clause  36  and
following articles relating to the so-called certificate of need.

The objective that I refer to says:


  To promote a spirit  of  co-operation  and  shared  responsibility  among
  public and private health professionals and providers and other  relevant
  sectors within the context of national, provincial  and  district  health
  plans.

In line with this objective, we contend that South Africa needs  a  thriving
private health-care sector that can address the needs of  as  many  citizens
as possible and, in so doing, take some of the pressure off an  overburdened
public health-care system. However, the  problems  we  have  identified  are
mainly those provisions which could easily discourage rather than  encourage
private-sector providers which, in our view,  would  be  highly  regrettable
and must be avoided. The New NP's position in respect of the certificate  of
need is a matter  of  public  record  that  was  put  forward  directly  for
consideration to those taking  the  final  political  decisions  immediately
after  the  public  hearings,  and  our  position   was   also   extensively
articulated by the New  NP  spokesperson,  Dr  Gous,  during  the  portfolio
hearings and again today.

There are other aspects of the Bill that are problematic, which Dr Gous  has
also dealt with, but I would like to say that  there  are  two  particularly
positive aspects of the Bill, which I would like to  emphasise  our  support
for, even though the certificate of  need  provisions  are  obliging  us  to
oppose it. They  are  clause  4,  which  actually  relates  to  free  health
services in public health establishments,  and  the  clauses  in  Chapter  2
relating to rights and  duties  of  users  and  health-care  providers,  and
specifically provisions for the lodging of complaints, an area which, in  my
view, must enjoy ongoing attention and high priority  in  the  interests  of
perceptions about and credibility of the whole public health system.
I also wish to quote from the  vision  and  mission  of  the  Department  of
Health, as set out  in  the  1999-2004  Health  Sector  Strategic  Framework
which, I must emphasise, my party and I fully support. It says, and  I  wish
to quote:


  Our vision is a caring and humane society in  which  all  South  Africans
  have access to affordable, good-quality health care. Our  mission  is  to
  consolidate ...

it says,


  ... and build on the achievements of the past  five  years  in  improving
  access to health care for all and reducing  inequity,  and  to  focus  on
  working in partnership with other stakeholders to improve the quality  of
  care at all levels  in  the  health  system,  especially  preventive  and
  promotive health, and to improve the overall efficiency  of  the  health-
  care delivery system.

I would just also want to say that our submission is that,  irrespective  of
differences we might have now as to how to achieve this vision,  all  of  us
should agree that it must, indeed, be achieved. I  also  know  that  in  the
course of the discussions in the committee, mention was made a few times  of
the need for greater private-sector representation in certain of the  bodies
which are envisaged, and I would like again,  today,  to  reiterate  support
for that view.
In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of myself and  also  my  party  as  a
whole, to very sincerely  thank  Dr  Ayanda  Ntsaluba  for  his  outstanding
contribution and service to health care in South Africa  over  a  period  of
many years, and to wish him  every  success  in  his  very  challenging  new
position. The gain of Foreign Affairs is certainly our loss.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr I M CACHALIA: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister,  hon  members  and  the
Department of Health, we start with the premise that health care is a  right
as enshrined in the Constitution and  that  the  state  is  responsible  for
ensuring that all South Africans have access to good-quality health care.

The massive inequalities associated with access to quality care  is  one  of
the key challenges that faces the health-care system. This lends  itself  to
weak health-care outcomes, despite the fact that considerable  progress  has
been made since 1994.

It is almost a truism that human resources determine the success or  failure
of  the  health-sector  transformation.  Human   resource   development   is
increasingly  being  recognised  as  the  key  to  improved  health  service
delivery. Health-sector transformation policies  have  to  acknowledge  that
health is a human system  and  has  to  address  itself  to  the  issues  of
personnel  staffing  the   service,   improving   planning,   capacity   and
management.

The section on human rights in the draft National Health Bill has  undergone
numerous changes over the years. In the August 2002 version,  the  whole  of
Chapter 7 is devoted to human resource planning and academic health  service
complexes. By the Department of Health's own admission, the Bill is  by  far
the most important Bill in the health sector.
By implication, it is also one of the key pieces of  legislation  to  ensure
the progressive realisation of human rights enshrined  in  the  Constitution
of the country. The Bill provides for a  structured  uniform  health  system
taking into account the obligations  imposed  by  the  Constitution  on  the
legislation on the national, provincial and local governments  with  respect
to health services.  The  Bill  provides  a  regulatory  framework  for  the
provision of health care in the private and public sectors and sets out  the
rights  and  duties  of  health-care  providers,  health   workers,   health
establishments, as well as users of health services.

Let us have a brief  look  at  the  human  resource  challenges  facing  the
Department of Health and  the  strategies  that  have  been  implemented  to
address them.

Firstly, there is the issue of capacity and skills. There  are  many  skills
lacking amongst frontline health workers encompassing a  broad  spectrum  of
services. Secondly, there is the issue of workload. There is much  variation
in terms of the  number  of  patients  seen.  Workloads  are  determined  by
structural  differences,  such   as   location,   size,   staffing   levels,
infrastructure and resourcing. Thirdly,  effective  management  and  support
are central to the performance of health personnel. Notably good  management
and support will improve work satisfaction and staff's ability to  function,
whereas lack of same  contributes  substantially  to  low  productivity  and
demotivation.

Fourthly, The SA Health Review 2002 states, and I quote:


  It can be said that HIV and Aids arguably pose the greatest challenge  to
  the human resource development in the health sector.

The health department is faced with the double  burden  of  having  to  cope
with not only increased morbidity and mortality in its own ranks,  but  also
has to carry the impact of an  increasing  disease  burden  in  the  general
population. Fifthly, there is the issue of migration. The SA  Health  Review
2002 cites lack of management, work overload, poor  working  conditions  and
emotional burnout as factors which contribute  to  low  productivity,  staff
morale and quality of care. This in turn contributes to the brain  drain  or
migration of health workers.

Clause 56 states  that  the  Minister  may  consult  with  the  Minister  of
Education to establish academic  health  complexes.  The  hon  Minister  has
already alluded to this clause in this debate.

Clause  57  permits  the  Minister  to  make  regulations  regarding   human
resources within the national health system. In Clause 53,  the  policy  and
guidelines contemplated must, amongst other things, facilitate and  advance:
the  adequate  distribution   of   human   resources;   the   provision   of
appropriately advanced skills at all levels of the  national  health  system
to meet the population's health-care  needs;  the  effective  and  efficient
utilisation, functioning, management and support of human  resources  within
the national health system.

The health department has been allocated R500 million  for  the  first  time
this year to retain  those  professionals  who  are  in  particularly  short
supply  and  to  attract  more  to  the  health  sector.   The   Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework provides for some expansion over the next few years  -
to R750 million next year and to R1 billion in 2005-06.
The importance of remuneration, improved housing conditions,  more  generous
bursaries,  including  the  creation  of  better  management  and  a  better
resourced work environment, is also being recognised.

Whilst the Bill makes important provisions that will to some extent  address
the human resource challenges faced in the health sector, much more  can  be
done to strengthen and give more effect to the provisions made.

In addition, the necessary budgetary resources would need  to  be  allocated
in the next financial year, to give effect to the  provisions  made  in  the
Bill. I am greatly encouraged by the emphasis and  policies  being  paid  to
human resource development by  the  Ministry  of  Health.  We,  in  the  ANC
support this Bill. I thank you.

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, die Vryheidsfront sal  nie
hierdie  wetsontwerp  steun  nie,  en  die  hoofrede  gaan  basies  oor  die
sertifikaat vir nodigheid.

Die taak van die agb Minister is om gesondheidsdienste  uit  te  brei,  maar
die agb Minister kom met hierdie wetsontwerp en plaas 'n  beperking  op  die
uitbreiding van  gesondheidsdienste.  As  die  agb  Minister  die  hospitale
besoek, behoort sy te kan besef dat die huidige aantal  hospitale  wat  daar
is nie eens na behore die aantal pasiënte kan hanteer nie.  As  'n  mens  by
hospitale kom en as 'n mens in die media kyk, is daar  hoeveel  gevalle  van
mense wat selfs ure in toue moet staan net om gehelp  te  word.  Daarom  kan
die Vryheidsfront nie verstaan dat die agb Minister kom en 'n beperking  wil
plaas in terme van die ontwikkeling van privaathospitale en dienste nie.

Behalwe dat dit tog seer sekerlik deel van die ekonomiese kragte is dat,  as
daar mense is wat sulke fasiliteite  beskikbaar  wil  stel,  hulle  dit  kan
doen, beperk die agb Minister ook die groei van die  ekonomie.  Ek  wil  vir
die agb Minister sê, die groot probleem van die agb Minister is dat  sy  nie
meer antwoorde en oplossings het wat sy kan aanbied nie en omdat sy dít  nie
kan doen nie, kom sy en gryp terug na die verlede  en  beskuldig  apartheid.
En as hulle nie apartheid kan beskuldig nie, dan kom gryp hulle die  kwessie
aan van die verskil tussen ryk en arm; en dan is dit nou die rykes se  skuld
dat daar nie dienste gelewer kan word nie.

Die agb Minister moet na vore tree en begin dienste lewer en, as daar  mense
is wat gesondheidsdienste wil bevorder en  verder  wil  uitbrei,  vir  hulle
eintlik aanmoedig om dit te kan doen; nie 'n beperking  plaas  soos  hierdie
huidige wetsontwerp nie. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, the Freedom Front will not  be
supporting  this  Bill,  and  the  main  reason   basically   concerns   the
certificate of need.

The task of the hon the Minister is to extend health services, but  the  hon
the Minister introduces a  Bill  that  restricts  the  extension  of  health
services. If the hon the Minister visited the hospitals, she  would  realise
that the present number of hospitals cannot  even  cope  properly  with  the
number of patients. If one visits hospitals and  looks  at  reports  in  the
media, one sees that there are many instances  where  people  even  have  to
queue for hours simply to receive assistance. This is why the Freedom  Front
cannot understand why the hon the Minister comes here wanting  to  impose  a
restriction  with  regard  to  the  development  of  private  hospitals  and
services.

Apart from the fact that surely it is part of economic forces that if  there
are people who want to make facilities such as these available, they can  do
so, the hon the Minister is also restricting the growth of  the  economy.  I
want to say to the hon the Minister that her main problem  is  that  she  no
longer has answers and solutions to offer, and because she cannot  do  this,
she comes and harks back to the past  and  blames  apartheid.  And  if  they
cannot blame apartheid, they seize  upon  the  question  of  the  difference
between the rich and the poor, and  now  the  rich  are  to  blame  for  the
inability to deliver services.

The hon the Minister must step forward and start  delivering  services  and,
if there are people who want to promote health services and expand them,  in
fact encourage them to do so; not impose a limitation such as  this  present
Bill. Thank you.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC supports the  National  Health  Bill.
We  observe  that,  particularly  in  its  preamble,   it   recognises   the
socioeconomic injustices, imbalances and inequities of  health  services  of
the past, the need to heal  the  divisions  of  the  past  and  establish  a
society based on social justice and fundamental human rights, and  the  need
to improve the quality of life of all citizens of our country.

It is painfully observed by all  justice-loving  people  that,  at  present,
there are hospitals for the poor and there are those for  the  rich.  It  is
known that those who do not have money do  not  get  proper  treatment  and,
therefore, their life expectancy is short.

In many institutions of health, especially in the rural  areas  and  in  the
townships where the majority of the poor live, the standard of hospitals  is
atrocious. In many of them, there are  no  medicines,  ambulances,  and  the
medical staff working there  is  demoralised.  Hence,  we  have  seen  large
numbers of nurses leaving the country to go and work in  countries  such  as
Britain and Saudi Arabia.

Chapter 1 of the Bill is, to a large extent, in accordance with  section  27
of the Constitution, which inter alia reads that everyone has the  right  to
have access  to  health-care  services  and  that  no  one  may  be  refused
emergency medical treatment.

Many times this is happening  because  many  government  hospitals  are  not
capacitated  to  give  the  appropriate  medical  treatment  and  privatised
hospitals are too expensive. There is a need for private  hospital  fees  to
be regulated. Many private hospitals are butcheries;  to  them  money  comes
first, then the care of human life. They are too profit-motivated.

Chapter 2, however, must provide also for the protection of  the  rights  of
providers. The PAC welcomes clause 49. This referral from one public  health
establishment to another is helpful, but it  must  be  extended  to  private
hospitals if more lives, especially those of the poor, are to be saved.

The  PAC  admits  that  there  should  be  no  interference   with   private
institutions, but in order for the vast majority of this country to  advance
there needs to be a certain degree  of  state  intervention  in  matters  of
national importance, especially those that deal with the  basic  necessities
of life.

The poor, through privatisation of essential services, are denied the  basic
necessities of life. However, the PAC supports this Bill in  the  hope  that
it will, when it has become law, be amended with a view to improving  it  so
that it can benefit the poor who cannot afford high medical fees. Rights  to
access without capacity to afford are no rights.

Dr A N LUTHULI: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, at the very  outset  I
want to state that my party, the ANC - the party  of  the  majority  of  the
people of South Africa - supports this Bill, Minister.

The Department  of  Health's  strategic  framework  for  2000-04  identifies
improvements in the quality of care  as  one  of  the  four  key  challenges
facing the health sector in South Africa.

Provisions relating to the health  officers  and  compliance  procedures  in
Chapter 10 of the  National  Health  Bill  are  essentially  concerned  with
ensuring good service delivery within health facilities.

Quality of care relates to the interface between provider and  patient,  and
between health services and the community.  A  quality  perspective  changes
the focus from establishing structures to addressing what happens  in  these
structures. Improving the quality of health services should,  therefore,  be
seen within the context of the broader transformation of health services  in
South Africa.

My focus for the debate on this important Bill  will  be  on  the  areas  of
national health research and information;  health  officers  and  compliance
procedures; the importance of co-ordinating the health research  agenda  and
national health information system, and  procedures  to  ensure  compliance,
safety and efficacy. These are covered in Chapters 9 and 10 of this Bill.

Let me, briefly, mention some of the research agencies in  the  country:  We
have  the  Medical  Research  Council,  the  Council  for   Scientific   and
Industrial Research, the Agricultural Research Council, the  Human  Sciences
Research Council, and many others which exist in the academic  institutions.
They will be subject to the provisions of this Bill.

The Bill recognises the setting  up  and  the  importance  of  the  National
Health Research Committee of 15 persons by  the  Minister  of  Health  after
consultation with the National Health Council. The National Health  Research
Committee acts as a  co-ordinating  body  whose  function  is  to  help  the
country determine its research agenda according to the country's needs,  our
needs.

The aim is to use our limited resources in the best interest of  our  health
needs. It is important in countries such as ours,  with  limited  resources,
that research should be sensitive to this  issue  and  thus  its  relevancy.
Determining the research agenda informs  the  required  health  budget.  The
National Health Research Committee advises the Minister.

At the moment, for instance, if we look at what is happening, the  developed
world is focusing increasingly on disease research relevant to  them  rather
than on research to develop drugs that are cheaper and effective to  address
diseases such as HIV/Aids, TB and malaria that are a serious scourge in  the
developing world and in countries such as South Africa. Therefore,  research
must be relevant and dictated by the disease needs of the country.

It must look at cost  and  human  resource  implications  of  interventions.
Again, looking at HIV/Aids,  cost  implications  are  closely  coupled  with
human resource considerations. This has been said again  and  again  by  the
Ministry of Health in this country. When we  consider  implementation,  both
are crucial and especially relevant now that we have moved to  the  district
health system. We need to constantly audit our human resource component.  It
is all about planning.

Historically, there has been extensive exploitation of humans  for  research
purposes in our country. Clause 76 addresses this. For  instance,  the  Mail
and Guardian exposed a professor at Wits University who did cervical  cancer
research on women without their consent. There are many instances  from  the
past where  people  were  exploited  in  this  manner  simply  because  they
belonged  to  population  groups  that  were  devalued   by   segregationist
governments, including apartheid.

This ANC Government needs to correct this  situation.  We  say  we  need  to
inform the persons involved of the objectives of the research, the  possible
positive and negative consequences on their health and lives, and get  their
written consent. More vigilance is required in the case  of  the  vulnerable
in society.

Clause 77 sets up the National Health Research Ethics  Council.  Because  of
our history and the developed countries coming to  underdeveloped  countries
to do research, we need this council to  set  up  norms  and  standards  for
conducting research. For the first time, because researchers  will  have  to
register their research with this  council,  it  becomes  possible  for  the
Department of Health to monitor and know what is going on.

If  these  researchers  are  not  adhering  to  the  norms  and   standards,
interventions can be made to  effect  more  protection  of  people  on  whom
research is being done.

Clause 79 provides for the creation of a comprehensive national  information
system.  The  national  department  must  facilitate  and  co-ordinate   the
establishment, implementation and maintenance of this information system  by
provinces, districts, municipalities and the private sector.

Clause 82 sets up the inspectorate  for  health  establishments  to  monitor
compliance with the Bill. It will be set up by the relevant MECs in all  the
provinces to ensure accountability, transparency, safety  and  efficacy.  It
reports quarterly to the MEC and the MEC must submit  an  annual  report  to
the Minister.

This Bill establishes an Office  of  Standards  Compliance  set  up  by  the
director-general to keep the Minister of Health informed of the  quality  of
services throughout the country, and advises  on  norms  and  standards  for
quality in health services. The visits of the Portfolio Committee on  Health
to various provinces indicated the need for such a provision.

The Office of Standards Compliance will also advise on norms  and  standards
for the certificate of need processes. Its agents must inspect every  health
establishment and health agent, at least once every three  years  to  ensure
compliance  with  this  Act,  but  may  conduct  announced  or   unannounced
inspections of such a facility at any time.  Transgressions  can  result  in
the withdrawal or suspension of the certificate  of  need,  which  has  been
talked about a lot.  This  is  to  ensure  that  malpractice,  exploitation,
maldistribution and health establishments offering low-quality  services  do
not survive.

The IFP and the DA were set against this body, but this is a very  important
step towards ensuring quality health services and  protecting  patients  who
come from the underprivileged of our society that the IFP and the  DA  claim
so much to represent. They lead the forces who are  against  transformation.
Also, the IFP opposes any powers being given to  the  Minister  to  make  it
possible for her to effect transformation.

This Bill has aroused a lot of interest from the public, including  academic
institutions such as UCT, UWC and  others,  as  was  evident  during  public
hearings.

The existing National Health Bill dates back to 1977. It is  essentially  an
apartheid health Bill designed to cater for the interests of a  minority  of
South Africans, excluding the majority. The Bill before us  caters  for  all
South Africans and it's progressive.

There may be opposition to the Bill from some opposition parties, but we  in
the ANC want equity, quality,  safety  and  efficacy  in  the  provision  of
health services. All this Bill does is to take us a step closer to our  goal
of a better health and life for all, as envisaged  in  the  Freedom  Charter
and the Bill of Rights. I thank you. [Applause.]
Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.  The  importance  of  this
Bill has to be taken seriously, since it seeks to  establish  a  legislative
and regulatory framework for the delivery of health services for  all  South
Africans, and throughout South Africa.

It also seeks to create uniformity across the  nation  in  the  delivery  of
health services. The objects of  the  Bill  are  taking  responsibility  for
health and the eligibility for free  health  services,  and  to  fulfil  the
constitutional obligations of the Government, with  regards  to  the  rights
relating to health-care services, and  to  provide  the  population  of  the
Republic with the best possible health service with the available  resources
it can afford.

It also seeks to empower the  Minister  to  make  regulations  in  order  to
provide free health services to certain categories  of  persons.  This  Bill
also makes provisions regarding the rights of users of health services,  and
health-care providers, to information on health services.
The provisions relating to the national Department of  Health  in  providing
for the establishment of the National Health Council are most welcome.

But the Bill does not make provisions for  the  number  of  times  that  the
National Health Council should meet in a year. Therefore the Minority  Front
kindly requests the department to relook certain sections of  the  Bill  for
clarification.

The appointment of certain hospital boards by the  Minister  and  MECs,  and
the delivery of health services at non-health  establishments  like  schools
and other public places is most welcome.

In supporting the Bill, the Minority Front applauds the  department  on  the
introduction of  this  comprehensive  Bill  and  hopes  that  it  meets  its
obligations successfully and speedily.

In respect of the demarcation  of  health  districts,  with  due  regard  to
municipal boundaries relating to municipal health care in this  regard,  the
Minority Front feels that a proper structure should be put in place  in  the
provinces so as to have proper  consultations  with  communities  on  health
matters. Thank you, Madam. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Deputy Speaker, when I studied this Bill I had  to  pinch
myself to make sure that I am in South Africa, and not in Cuba - indeed,  it
is the most totalitarian piece of legislation I have ever seen.

The Bill states as one of its objects to establish a health system based  on
decentralised management. The national Minister, however,  got  a  de  facto
open mandate to regulate every  single  matter  concerning  health  care  in
South Africa, and every decision of the Minister,  after  consultation  with
one of the many councils created by this Bill.

The National Action regards this Bill as promoting  a  top-heavy  structure,
by creating structures and more structures, regulating the field  of  health
care in South Africa instead of improving it.

The most draconic chapter in this Bill is Chapter 6, which  deals  with  the
certificate of need.

Kortliks kom dit daarop  neer  dat  die  Minister  deur  hierdie  instrument
effektief kan besluit waar elke enkele dokter,  spesialis  of  professionele
gesondheidswerker mag werk en waar nie. Die Minister kry effektief  die  reg
om deur manipulering van hierdie sertifikaat  geneeshere  te  verplaas  asof
hulle lewenslange staatsamptenare is. Hierdie hoofstuk is  onkonstitusioneel
en  die  Minister  kan  haar  gereed  maak  vir  nog   'n   draai   in   die
Konstitusionele Hof.

Ek kan u verseker, agb Minister, markbeginsels van  aanbod  en  aanvraag  is
reeds 'n bevestiging van "need"  al  dan  nie.  Hierdie  wet  gaan  nie  die
standaard van mediese dienste verhoog nie. Dit gaan kompetisie  uitsluit  en
onderpresteerders in 'n veilige  hawe  verskans.  Dit  maak  van  die  staat
speler en skeidsregter en ontneem die keusevryheid van  die  verbruiker,  en
oorreguleer die privaatsektor.

Dit  gaan  lei  tot  'n  reuse  uittog  van  voornemende  en   praktiserende
geneeshere na die buiteland, net  om  plek  te  maak  vir  meer  Kubane  wat
daaraan gewoond is. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Briefly it means that the  Minister  may,  by  means  of  this  instrument,
effectively decide where every single  doctor,  specialist  or  professional
health worker is allowed to work and where  not.  The  Minister  effectively
gets the right to transfer doctors, by means of  manipulation  in  terms  of
this certificate, as if they were life-long public  servants.  This  chapter
is unconstitutional  and  the  Minister  can  prepare  herself  for  another
session in the Constitutional Court.

I can assure you, hon Minister, that market principles of supply and  demand
are already a confirmation of need or no need. This  Act  is  not  going  to
enhance  the  standard  of  medical  services.  It  is  going   to   exclude
competition and entrench underachievers in a  safe  haven.  This  makes  the
state a player and an umpire and takes away the choice of  freedom  for  the
consumer, and overregulates the private sector.]

In prescribing this Bill for a sick patient called South Africa, the  doctor
has made the wrong diagnosis again. The slogan should have  been  `Service!'
and not `Regulation!'

This is illustrated by a black person who said: In the old days  blacks  and
whites had to use separate entrances to hospitals, but at least we  received
treatment. Today we pass through the same door, but nobody  gets  treatment.
The National Action will vote against this Bill. I thank you.

Ms T E MILLIN: Madam Deputy Speaker, because of time  limits  the  IAM  will
get straight to the point in stating  absolute  agreement  with  the  cogent
arguments against this Bill, articulated with such authority by the  hon  Dr
Rabinowitz, as well as those members of the DA and others.

The progressively arbitrary use or misuse of power that certain  ministries,
namely  land  affairs,  education  and  health,   are   appropriating   unto
themselves should be of deep  and  growing  concern  to  all  South  African
citizens.

Never were such omnibus powers more evident than in the  infamous  so-called
CON with the ostensibly commendable aim of spreading, far and wide,  doctors
and private health-care institutions where the Government nanny  deems  such
should be.

If ever there was stronger  incentive  for  doctors  and  potential  medical
entrepreneurs  to  pack  up  and  leave,   thus   escaping   the   excessive
infringements on freedom of choice and movement, then this is  it.  And  for
this section alone, the hon Minister and her department can look forward  to
constitutional challenges once this Bill is enacted.

It is significant that the official opposition, together with  the  IFP  and
others, will not be supporting this Bill.

As a former IFP member in  the  KwaZulu-Natal  Legislature,  who  vigorously
opposed the Provincial  Health  Bill,  namely  the  CON,  and  unfortunately
vilified by my caucus under the chairmanship of the Premier  for  doing  so,
as well as for my suggestion at the time that the IFP should align with  the
DA in opposing the Bill, the decision then was to vote  with  its  coalition
ANC partner in support of the Bill.

However, it is good that common sense and sound democratic  principles  will
prevail when this vote is taken and those opposing its overriding  abuse  of
power are counted.

Crazy or not, thank goodness I'm sufficiently sane to discern a  dangerously
crazy piece of legislation. I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Deputy Speaker,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,
colleagues and friends, at the outset, may  I  remind  hon  Aucamp  -  I  am
certain he does not know where he is - that he is not in Cuba but he  is  in
a new and free  South  Africa.  The  National  Health  Bill  constitutes  an
important milestone on the road to the  achievement  of  a  sustainable  and
uniform health  system  within  the  Republic  -  one  which  is,  moreover,
cognisant of the requirements and principles of our new Constitution.

Historically, we have, in this  country,  two  blood  transfusion  services.
Firstly,  there  is  the  SA  Blood  Transfusion  Service,  which  currently
provides blood transfusion services, under a licence issued in terms of  the
Human Tissue Act 65 of 1983, exclusively to all provinces  of  the  Republic
except for the Western Cape and part of the Northern Cape. The  SA  National
Blood  Service,  or  SANBS,  provides  approximately  83%   of   all   blood
transfusions in South Africa.

The second is the Western Cape Blood  Transfusion  Service,  which  provides
blood transfusion services to the Western Cape and part  of  Northern  Cape.
In addition, we have the Natal Bioproducts Institute, which is  the  largest
fractionation centre in our country. It  is  also  an  association  not  for
gain. It is incorporated under section 21 of  the  Companies  Act  and  also
registered  as  a  nonprofit  organisation.  Its  board  of  directors   are
appointed by the SANBS board of directors and, hence  the  ultimate  control
of the Natal Bioproducts Institute rests with SANBS.

The national policy on blood transfusion in  South  Africa  determines  that
all blood supplies must be regarded as national resources  and  be  obtained
and utilised in the  national  interest.  This  policy  was  formulated  and
adopted by the Health Minmec on 25 and 26 September 1997.

The main motivation behind  a  well-organised  and  nationally  co-ordinated
blood transfusion service is to improve and ensure the safety of  blood  and
blood products. Blood can and does save lives when used  correctly.  On  the
other hand, it can also cause great harm if it is used incorrectly or if  it
is not safe.

The amalgamation of the  blood  transfusion  services  is  an  international
initiative and, endorsement has been received  from  various  organisations,
at various times, since 1973. In that year, the International Conference  of
the Red Cross recommended that each national society and  government  should
undertake a strong combined effort to attain humanitarian  objectives  of  a
total national blood service based on broad voluntary participation  of  the
people  of  the  land.  The  World  Health  Assembly  of  the  World  Health
Organisation supported this approach and urged member states to promote  the
development  of  a  national  blood  service,   based   on   voluntary   and
nonremunerated donation of blood.

Further  endorsement  was  received  from  the  General  Assembly   of   the
International Society of Blood Transfusion,  in  1980,  when  they  resolved
that the development of a national transfusion programme  regulated  by  the
appropriate  national  authority  was  essential  if  a  nation's  need   in
therapeutic blood products were to be met in full.

Confirmation for the need of a national service also  came  from  scientists
who  worked  in  the  blood  transfusion  systems  of   the   World   Health
Organisation's Global Programme on Aids who stated, in 1994, that  in  order
to  ensure  that  an  effective  and  efficient  blood  banking  system  was
established, it was recommended that a national blood transfusion  programme
be instituted.

In Africa, South Africa is one of only two countries with a  regional  blood
transfusion service. The World Health Organisation also seeks  to  establish
a global database of blood safety in all its regions in  order  to  identify
where action is needed. South Africa, being a member  country,  is  required
to participate in the global database initiative ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! hon members, please lower your voices.

Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Deputy Speaker, South Africa, being a  member  country,
is required to participate in the global database initiative and the  policy
framework to which it should adhere.

The policy framework that we have to adhere to  is  governmental  commitment
to blood safety; sound organisational structures; safe blood donors  -  that
means low-risk  blood;  quality  management  on  blood  screening,  storage,
transportation, distribution  and  donor  care;  appropriate  use  of  blood
products; equal accessibility; and a cost-effective and  efficient  service.
South Africa  will  comply  with  all  of  these  after  amalgamation.  This
framework should be supported by legislation and the Bill does that.

Over and above the main aim of an amalgamated blood transfusion  service  of
ensuring blood products and blood safety, many other  benefits  are  obvious
and tangible. For example: No duplication or fragmentation of services  will
take place; there will be optimisation of scarce resources;  there  will  be
no overlapping supply, research and  volunteer  donors;  there  will  be  no
competition   between   institutions   and   organisations;   the   national
preparedness for disaster will be efficient and  effective;  there  will  be
one pool of resources for research - for example  funding  can  be  used  on
research that will benefit the  whole  country;  blood  products  and  blood
safety will be recognised as a major public  health  issue;  continuity  and
standardisation  in  training,  and  development  of  human  resources   and
education will take place; quality assurance  can  be  improved  because  it
will be standardised and centralised; risk-sharing, especially of  high-risk
donors, will be undertaken; equitable distribution  of  blood  products  and
blood, especially in rural and underserved areas, will  be  undertaken;  the
services will be more  cost-effective,  economically  viable  and  efficient
because of economics of scale and economics of scope;  and,  it  will  allow
maximum health gain per unit  of  expenditure  within  acceptable  clinical,
ethical and moral standards.

Now, blood fractionation is an issue that is not covered under the  national
blood transfusion service  because  the  Medicines  and  Related  Substances
Control Act 101 of 1965 and the Pharmacy Act 53  of  1974  regulate  it.  An
organisation or facility is licensed  under  Act  101  section  22(6)  as  a
pharmaceutical  manufacturing  company  and  carries  out  business   as   a
pharmacy. There is, thus, no requirement for it to be licensed in  terms  of
this Act.

Coming to tissues and organs, all issues around the removal of  tissue  from
living and deceased persons need very  strict  control,  mostly  to  prevent
trafficking,  profit-making,  and,  unsafe  and  unethical  practices.   The
removal and, also, the acquiring  of  tissues  or  organs  and  the  consent
thereof will  be  further  regulated  by  the  Minister.  Any  organisation,
institution or person that will acquire, screen,  test,  store,  and  handle
human  tissue  or  tissue  products   for   transplantation   will   require
registration from the Department of Health.

The main aim for  the  registration  and  regulation  of  tissue  banks  and
donations is to prevent organ tissue trafficking and remuneration to  donors
or professionals other than as stipulated in  the  Bill.  The  Bill  further
enforces respect, dignity and consent for any action  on  a  deceased  body.
The right of donors and recipients of  donated  organs  or  tissue  will  be
protected in regulations as well.
The donation of organs and tissue is an act of generosity and love; it is  a
gift and should be protected as such.  The  noncommercialisation  of  organs
and tissues is soundly established in this National Health Bill. We, in  the
ANC, support this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT: Madam Deputy Speaker, I may shock all speakers  who  opposed
this legislation by stating at the outset that I felt  there  was  something
positive in the Bill, and that is  the  prohibition  on  human  cloning.  At
least South Africa will be spared the possibility of  a  clone  of  the  hon
Minister of Health being let loose on the country.

In the chapter that sets out our Bill of Rights, we find  the  following  in
section 22 on freedom of trade, occupation and profession:  ``Every  citizen
has the right to choose their trade, occupation or profession  freely.''  It
goes on to say: ``The practice of a trade, occupation or profession  may  be
regulated by law.''

But it is trite law and the provision that the practice of, inter alia,  the
profession  may  be  regulated  by  law  does  not  give  carte  blanche  to
Parliament. The regulation may not be such as to destroy the right  that  is
protected and may not even be such  that  it  seriously  impinges  upon  the
right. It may not strike at the heart of the protected right.

It is my submission that section 36 of this Bill strikes  at  the  heart  of
the right of the medical practitioners and organisations  offering  services
in the medical  field  to  choose  their  profession  freely.  This  section
prohibits a person, inter alia, from  establishing  a  health  establishment
such as hospitals,  surgeries  or  to  provide  prescribed  health  services
without a certificate of need, which is to be obtained  from  the  director-
general in terms of regulations.

This section does not set minimum standards nor does it deal  with  required
qualifications or any other matter  that  really  regulates  a  professional
occupation. It simply says that a medical practitioner will only be  allowed
to practice his or her profession if the director-general  judges  there  to
be a need. What nonsense! It destroys the basic right of a person  to  offer
his or her services  wherever  he  or  she  chooses.  It  is  an  outrageous
infringement on the basic freedom to work enshrined in our Constitution.

When I was a child, my mother taught me one good thing. She said that  there
was always room at the top. This is how one enshrines excellence.  The  only
need is the need to be excellent, better than the next person  and  to  make
one's living where one chooses.

Today, we appeal to the President, and  we  shall  follow  this  up  with  a
presentation to him, not to assent to this legislation  but  to  follow  the
route  set  out  in  section  79   of   the   Constitution   to   test   the
constitutionality of this section. However,  should  the  President  assent,
the DA shall have to pursue the other constitutional  avenues  to  test  its
constitutionality. We shall go to the absolute limit to do so.
In conclusion, there is a dire need to extend proper  medical  care  to  all
our people throughout South Africa; not, hon Minister,  aspirins  only.  The
certificate of need is not the route to go. [Interjections.] Go  and  see  a
doctor. The only certificate of need that should be issued is a  certificate
that South Africa needs a new Minister of Health. [Applause.]

Mrs S F BALOYI: Deputy Chairperson, the Minister and  Deputy  Minister,  hon
members and colleagues, I rise in support of the National Health Bill.

It is a great privilege to participate in this debate because this  Bill  is
the most important piece of health legislation to be passed by  this  House.
It is the overarching legislation that  covers  all  major  aspects  of  our
national health system. Today marks the culmination of  a  long  process  of
broad consultation with relevant stakeholders as well  as  a  very  thorough
process of public hearings, discussions  and  interaction  even  during  the
committee stage to ensure that the final result of the Bill  is  the  result
of a collective and inclusive process, which  the  opposition  parties  have
acknowledged.

I want to thank Comrade James for a very thorough  and  democratic  process.
This is the way within the ANC. We appreciate the  assistance  of  Drs  Kamy
Chetty, Thabo Sibeko, Eddie Mhlanga, Ms Debbie Pearman and Mr Horn, the  law
adviser, who guided us through this Bill, which was not  an  easy  task.  It
was a very difficult Bill to deal with.

I also want to pay tribute to Dr Ayanda Ntsaluba for his  impeccable  record
as director-general for the department. His contribution will  be  difficult
to match. The department's loss is Foreign Affairs' gain. We wish  him  well
in his new post.

I shall not waste my time by responding to some  of  the  issues  that  were
raised by opposition parties. They raised these issues because this Bill  is
the most transformatory of all the  Bills  that  have  passed  through  this
House. They are concerned with  making  profits  because  this  touches  the
private sector. We are bringing the private sector, which has exploited  our
people for many years, on  board.  [Interjections.]  Whether  these  members
like or not, we are going to proceed with this Bill. [Applause.]
They talk of basic rights, but this is transformation.  Our  mandate  is  to
transform the health system of this country and we shall do so. We  are  not
going to ask for anyone's permission. [Applause.] The  ANC's  transformation
agenda  continues   to   fulfil   the   constitutional   rights,   including
reproductive rights, of the people of South Africa to progressively  realise
access to quality health-care services. The  ANC  has  been  entrusted  with
representing the interests of the majority of  our  people.  Our  assessment
must always be based on whether the poor and vulnerable benefit.

The private/public mix will ensure a fair  distribution  of  facilities  and
equipment.   A   new   private   health   establishment   where   there   is
underutilisation will not be in the interest or meet the need of  the  local
community as is happening now. We are putting a stop to this. What  will  be
best is for the private sector to enter into an  agreement  to  utilise  the
facilities in the public sector that are  underutilised  and  transfer  that
equipment and other processes that are being used in the private  sector  to
the public sector. This will result in a fairer distribution.

The DA and IFP are just jestering for political  expediency.  They  want  to
deprive our people of access to equal health  care  by  claiming  that  this
certificate  should  have  no  time  limit  as  this  will  restrict  health
providers from  practising.  They  have  it  all  wrong.  They  need  to  be
educated. They have also claimed that the certificate will restrict  doctors
from participating in the free market. I find this  argument  quite  amusing
considering that the USA and Canada, both  proponents  of  the  free  market
system  and  capitalism,  have   introduced   the   certificate   of   need.
[Interjections.] Where do you come from? [Interjections.]

If we are to ensure equity and quality of services,  we  need  to  hold  the
health establishment accountable. We do so by granting  them  a  certificate
of need to operate for up to 20 years. I repeat ``for up to 20 years''.  I'm
repeating this so that you can get it  into  your  heads.  Thereafter,  they
must  apply  for  renewal,  which  will  be  subject  to   compliance   with
requirements as set out in the Bill. The requirements are  set  out  in  the
Bill to meet the needs of our disadvantaged people, and  not  to  meet  your
needs. [Interjections.]

Many stakeholders such as the Health Professions Council and others  support
the certificate of need, which they said was  long  overdue.  We  must  take
into consideration the number of health establishments that have  mushroomed
mainly in urban areas, which has resulted in overservicing  and  competition
for clients,  overcharging  of  clients  and  unethical  and  unprofessional
behaviour and practices, and has been to the detriment of the  patients  and
communities they serve.

We cannot and dare not turn back from  passing  this  legislation.  We  also
have a duty to ensure that we are fully aware of the implications for  those
who deliver services for profit or not for profit.  In  the  health  sector,
the  interest  of  the  communities  supersede  those  of  the   individual,
especially if those individuals are already privileged  within  the  broader
class structure.

When the ANC came into power more  than  nine  years  ago,  we  promised  to
change all aspects of South African society to the betterment of  all.  This
was done to address the legacy of inequities and disparities  of  the  past.
This is what we are doing. The ANC  is  delivering,  and  will  continue  to
deliver accessible quality health-care services as envisaged and  laid  down
in this Bill.  This  is  to  fulfil  the  mandate  of  our  voters  and  the
communities at large, even your communities.

Clauses 40 and 41 deal with the classification  of  a  health  establishment
and the certificate of need. These clauses are  key  transformatory  clauses
to  the  establishment  and  provision  of  a  national  health  system.   A
certificate of need is introduced as a critical intervention in  the  health
sector. This certificate is designed to address the duplication of  services
resulting from an ever-increasing number  of  health  establishments,  which
are usually private and for profit, and which, for  all  these  years,  have
been insufficiently regulated.

The ANC feels strongly that it is not correct that  the  only  consideration
one thinks of in establishing a health facility must be how much profit  one
is going to make. This approach is totally wrong and will not be accepted.

At the hearings we became aware that stakeholders did  not  have  a  problem
with the certificate but had perceived problems with its  implementation.  I
believe that this concern will be addressed as consultations  will  be  held
during the development of the regulations of this Bill.  Therefore,  I  must
clarify that the certificate is a way of ensuring that the licensing  of  an
establishment is linked with appropriate delivery of services  and  not  the
capability for financial gain.

Other misconceptions around this Bill  will  be  implemented  regardless  of
specific conditions in the area. Section 40  of  the  Bill  stipulates  that
health  establishments  will  be  classified.  Different  considerations  or
criteria will be applied in each category.

Obviously, there will be a dispensation for existing  health  establishments
which will hopefully encourage gradual  change  and  positioning  of  health
service delivery to be more appropriate and responsive to the needs  of  the
poor and the vulnerable.

It has been a long road to travel since 1994 to bring  about  transformation
to our country's national health system. It is therefore proper  that  today
we should rejoice at the  processing  of  this  very  important  Bill  which
provides uniformity in the health-care services.

The certificate of need is essential to address the  inequities,  access  to
and uniformity of the national health system and to  address  the  anomalies
of  the  past.  The  Bill  promotes  a  need  for  an  appropriate  mix   of
public/private health services to address disparities.
The ANC Government shall therefore not waiver nor be distracted  by  the  DA
or the IFP in addressing the issue of inherent  disparities  in  the  health
sector. It will advance the programme of  transformation  by  ensuring  that
our health system complies with the norms  and  standards  of  our  national
health system. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Chairperson, I would like to thank  everybody
who participated in this debate. I have said it before in this House that  I
do not and will never take MP Kalyan seriously. I  therefore  will  continue
to ignore her in both my discussions and responses, both in this  House  and
also in the portfolio committee, for as long as she  discusses  persons  and
not issues that are also not related to the Bill.  [Interjections.]  Despite
our prohibition on cloning, we have experienced it in this Parliament -  the
cloning of the old apartheid NP into the present-day DA and I think we  have
let you loose for too long. It is about time we clipped your wings.

I now address myself to this House in response to the issues that have  been
raised. I think we must accept that even  though  the  state  is  a  service
provider, it must also put in place legislative framework. This  is  at  the
core of the stewardship role of  Government.  It  is  unfortunate  that  the
opposition parties have reduced this  debate  only  to  the  issues  of  the
certificate of need and actually they have misrepresented issues as well.  I
would like to  emphasise  what  Comrade  James  said  -  that  in  fact  the
certificate  of  need  is  intended  to  break  down  the  consequences   of
apartheid.

In addition, the director-general will not be doing all  the  work  himself.
He will delegate most of the work to be done at the provincial level. So  it
is not true that it is concentrated around  the  director-general.  We  must
accept that to undo the ravages of the past we require special  measures  to
ensure that all our people have equal access to health care.  We  will  take
all steps to ensure that health services  are  spread  equitably  throughout
the country and in doing so we will not antagonise service providers. As  my
fellow comrades and as Comrade James stated, health is  a  public  good.  It
cannot be left to market forces. We must take  every  step  to  protect  the
poor and make sure that there is universal access to basic health  care  for
every South African.

Rabinowitz, I am really disappointed that you stand here  and  declare  that
you are speaking on behalf of the poor and yet you refuse  to  support  this
Bill on the basis of clauses that limit the powers  and  privileges  of  big
business. I am really disappointed. You are not speaking on  behalf  of  the
poor.

I am also disappointed by your reference  to  the  fact  that  there  is  no
mention of traditional healers. You have a very short memory. You know  that
we are processing a Bill on traditional practitioners. I  do  not  know  why
you wanted us to add it here when we have a  specific  Bill  on  traditional
practitioners. You forget also ... [Interjections.] ... just on something  -
we  launched  the  national  reference  sector  for  traditional   remedies.
However, you forget this very easily.

To Dudley, I am sure that the many Christians that voted for you across  the
whole country expect that you do engage the ruling party on  broader  policy
issues and not just on the right to life. It has become a singsong  for  you
- abortion, abortion, abortion. [Laughter.] Mama Nkabinde,  thank  you  very
much for supporting the Bill. You are, of course, aware that the  Bill  will
improve the quality of life of the people who elected us  into  this  House,
particularly the poor.

To Mr Groenewald, whether we like it or not, the legacy of our past and  the
disparity between the rich and the poor is a reality. This is not the  ANC's
fault, in fact the ANC has liberated the freedom party too from the  secular
apartheid regime. Therefore, Mr Groenewald, let  us  embrace  our  past  and
work together to a brighter future. That is what the ANC stands for  and  we
will carry you with us to freedom.

Hon Pheko, thank you very much for supporting the  Bill  and  your  pro-poor
exposé. Hon Aucamp, I am flattered that you could mistake our health  system
for Cuba, considering the fact that  every  dollar  invested  in  the  Cuban
health system is one invested  in  one  of  the  most  efficient  and  cost-
effective health systems in the world in terms of the  health  outcomes  and
returns on investment. Hon Rajbally, I know I can  always  rely  on  you  to
provide  constructive  criticism  but  also  to  support  a  piece  of  good
legislation when you see it.

Chairperson, I think this is as far as I can comment because I think I  have
covered everything else by declaring that this Bill  actually  is  meant  to
redress the legacy of the past and I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

   CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN
  DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PROTOCOL ON FORESTRY, IN TERMS OF SECTION 231(2) OF
                                CONSTITUTION

Mr J F VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, the members of the Portfolio  Committee  on
Water Affairs and Forestry were unanimous in adopting the report  in  favour
of the ratification of the SADC Protocol on Forestry. In doing so,  we  join
our colleagues in the NCOP who have already ratified the  protocol  in  line
with the requirements of our Constitution.

After we in the National Assembly have ratified this  protocol,  it  becomes
binding, as an international agreement, according to section 231(2)  of  the
Constitution. In doing so this week, we contribute to an  awareness  of  the
importance of forestry in our country, in our environment and in our  social
development - which are the goals  of  arbour  -  which  we  also  celebrate
throughout our country during this week.

In ratifying the SADC Protocol  on  Forestry  exactly  a  year  after  South
Africa successfully hosted the World Summit on Sustainable  Development,  we
express our commitment to leading the nations  of  our  region  and  of  our
continent towards a better future.

Why should we ratify the SADC Protocol on Forestry? Will it really  help  to
achieve growth, eradicate poverty, protect the environment and  bring  about
sustainable use of natural resources as it aims to do? The point  is,  these
goals are attainable, provided we take steps, as a region, to work  together
on the implementation  of  policies,  programmes  and  projects  within  the
framework of economic integration. We must continue, as  a  region,  to  win
the support and co-operation  of  international  agencies  in  pursuing  our
goals.

We must live up to the ideals expressed in the founding document  for  SADC,
the  Declaration  Treaty  and  the  Protocol  for   the   Southern   African
Development Community, signed by the heads of state in 1992 and  acceded  to
by us in 1994.

The ideals of  meaningful  co-operation  and  good-neighbourliness  will  be
taken forward with ratification of this  protocol,  which  comes  under  the
treaty. Our time does not allow us to go into detail  of  how  the  protocol
will accelerate co-operation within  SADC  on  a  wide  range  of  forestry-
related programmes. I can simply highlight some areas that will be  covered:
Food security,  regarding  agriculture  and  generally;  our  management  of
natural resources and  the  environment;  social  welfare;  information  and
culture.
As a leader in the African Union and Nepad initiatives, South Africa  should
always be at the forefront in ratifying original agreements.  The  Portfolio
Committee on Water Affairs  and  Forestry,  having  considered  the  report,
unanimously recommended the ratification of  this  protocol.  I  thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

There was no debate.

SADC Protocol on Forestry approved.

 CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF LEASE OF SEA
 SPACE TO MARIBUS INDUSTRIES (PTY) LTD SEAWEED CULTIVATION PROJECT, IN TERMS
                     OF SECTION 6 OF SEA-SHORE ACT, 1935

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE:  Deputy  Chairperson,  after  consulting  all  the
parties in the portfolio committee, we decided that there  is  no  need  for
any speeches on this. We all agreed that the lease of sea  space  should  be
granted. Thank you.

There was no debate.
Lease of sea space to  Maribus  Industries  (Pty)  Ltd  Seaweed  Cultivation
Project approved.

     CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON PRIVATE MEMBERS'
  LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND SPECIAL PETITIONS ON MEDICAL SCHEMES AMENDMENT
                     BILL AND ON PATENTS AMENDMENT BILL

Mr P A C  HENDRICKSE:  Chairperson,  the  purpose  of  the  Medical  Schemes
Amendment Bill is to allow medical schemes to offer members  a  discount  on
their contribution rates when they retire or go on pension, and for this  to
be extended to the spouse upon death of a member.

The committee shared in the intention, that is,  to  assist  pensioners  who
become liable for the whole subscription, both their own  as  well  as  that
which the employer previously contributed. However, it  is  the  opinion  of
the committee that this is  not  the  correct  vehicle  to  do  so,  as  the
proposal shifts postretirement liability for medical  expenditure  from  the
employer to medical schemes.  Secondly,  the  medical  schemes  are  in  the
business of receiving contributions and paying claims, which are  short-term
liabilities,  and  are  not   designed   as   a   vehicle   for   prefunding
postretirement liabilities.

We share the  opinion  of  the  Department  of  Health  that  postretirement
provision for medical expenditure is  an  employee  benefit,  and  that  the
appropriate avenue to correct declining provision being  made  for  this  by
the employers is through labour-relation  legislation.  There  is  also  the
concern  that  such  a  proposal,  whilst  not  intending  to  do  so,   may
inadvertently open doors for discrimination against people  with  poor  risk
profiles, by not offering them these intended discounts.

The committee has recommended  that  the  proposer  take  this  concern  for
pensioners up with  the  Ministry  of  Labour  and,  if  possible,  have  it
channelled to Nedlac for discussion.

In  conclusion,  allow  me  to  thank  the  Department  of  Health  for  its
interactive relationship with the committee. I also want to thank the  other
stakeholders who appeared before it.

Lastly, may I congratulate the proposer, Mr Bell, for bringing  before  this
committee what is a very good example of a private member's  proposal.  This
proposal  received  multi-party  empathy,  pointing  intentions  to  a  real
concern, rather than what is so  often  the  case,  parties  bringing  Bills
there  purely  to  make  party-political  propaganda,  or  to  override  the
policies of a democratically elected government. Thank you very much to  all
the members for their contributions to discussions in the committee.

We support the report. [Applause.]

Mrs S V KALYAN: Deputy Chair, the DA proposed an amendment  to  the  Patents
Amendment Bill some two years ago. The rationale behind  the  amendment  was
that by declaring HIV/Aids a national health emergency, South  Africa  could
produce or import generic equivalents of antiretroviral medication,  thereby
making it affordable to persons who are HIV-positive. We based the  proposed
amendment on the success story of Brazil and Thailand. It is not stale  news
that people are dying of HIV/Aids.

After much humming and hawing, the Committee on Private Members  Legislative
Proposals turned down the proposed amendment without much substance,  saying
that trade agreements between South Africa  and  other  countries  would  be
affected. The reality is that South Africa is  still  in  denial  about  the
HIV/Aids pandemic. Well, guess what? On Friday last week,  the  World  Trade
Organisation acceded to an impassioned  appeal  from  Africa,  allowing  the
importation of generic equivalents. Their claim was based  on  compassionate
grounds, because nearly 2,2 million Africans have already died from Aids.

Now, suddenly, South Africa is on  board,  and  has  also  bought  into  the
agreement. Had we acted two years ago on the recommendation of the DA,  many
lives would have been saved. [Interjections.] You can howl!  As  it  stands,
one in nine South Africans are HIV-positive.  Regrettably,  the  committee's
vision was blinkered by party politics. The DA regrets  that  the  committee
could not see the larger picture and rejects its report. [Applause.]

Prince N E  ZULU:  Deputy  Chair,  I  must  also  start  by  commending  the
proposers of these  two  pieces  of  legislation  before  us.  The  proposed
Medical Schemes Amendment Bill purports to take cognisance of  those  fellow
citizens who, for reasons beyond their control, become victims  of  old  age
and/or ill health, thus disqualifying them from  being  members  of  medical
aid schemes.

The main income after  retirement  does  not  allow  a  member  to  continue
contributing  to  a  medical  scheme,  except  in  exceptional  cases.  This
amendment seeks to provide a discounted rate for  those  members  and  their
spouses. However, to work out such  a  scheme  would  be  very  complex  and
almost   impracticable,   given   prevailing   circumstances   of   crafting
legislation that becomes difficult to implement.  There  is  no  appropriate
suggestion  that  identifies  potential  solutions   to   that   complexity.
Therefore,  the  report  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Private  Members'
Legislative Proposals that the Bill not be proceeded with, is supported.

Further, the existing Patents Act provides various mechanisms by  which  the
state can acquire the right to produce goods, of whatever  description,  for
public need  and  purposes  without  necessarily  legislating  a  compulsory
licensing measure. The many sections of the Act  make  it  abundantly  clear
that the state has much broader and more general  access  to  patent  rights
than one would imagine, and those legal provisions render the said  proposal
more of a duplication of what is contained in the Act than a real,  new  and
innovative proposal. Therefore, the status quo remains. Thank you.

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairperson, private members' Bills are not  treated  with  the
respect that they deserve. Personally I have not laid eyes  on  either  Bill
before yesterday, and even the relevant ATC was missing. A private  member's
Bill  should  be  adequately  debated,  especially  in  relevant   portfolio
committees, which does not happen.

The Medical Schemes Amendment Bill is a positive development which the  ACDP
would support. Issues around patents and international trade agreements  are
of critical importance, but are usually drowned in the sea of  politics  and
confusion, and obviously drowned in a sea of  something  else  here  in  the
House. The ACDP would welcome the possibility of these issues  coming  under
the spotlight. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Deputy Chair, members of Parliament, thank  you  for  affording
me this opportunity  to  explain  my  suggested  amendment  to  the  Medical
Schemes Act. This Act attempted to  protect  the  public  from  unscrupulous
medical schemes by ensuring that a single rate be imposed on their  members.
The contribution to belong to the scheme could only be varied  according  to
income or number of dependants, not according to age.

The aim of this clause aims to  stop  schemes  from  exploiting  persons  of
advanced age or poor health. Unfortunately, this clause has  had  unintended
consequences by restricting  some  restricted  medical  schemes  which  had,
within their approved rules, given a discount to their pensioners  with  the
required number of years as members, on taking retirement.

This has resulted in pensioners who, until retirement, have  had  a  portion
of their contributions paid for by their employer now having  to  pay  their
entire rates. This could mean hard times ahead for  those  pensioners  on  a
fixed  income.  The  private  members'  committee  was  sympathetic  to   my
proposal. The labour portfolio, who discussed  it  after  it  was  rejected,
thought it was an excellent idea.

Medical schemes that operate this discount have done so from  the  start  of
the scheme. It is a pity that this factor was not taken into account at  the
time when the Act was passed. I'm sure that the result would have been  very
different if the Act had stated that one of the  objectives  is  to  protect
the interests of all members.  But,  this  Act  has  not  done  so  for  the
pensioners of these schemes.

I thank you for listening to my plea. If this could  lead  to  a  change  of
heart, a large number of pensioners will be able to sleep better  at  night.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A R AINSLIE: Deputy Chair, Mrs Kalyan's constant attempts  to  politicise
the HIV/Aids question is to be  condemned.  To  introduce  the  question  of
HIV/Aids into the debate today is just a red herring to  obscure  the  flaws
in her proposal.

It is clear that Mrs Kalyan has not even read the Patents Act. If  she  had,
the hon member would know that the state already has access to articles  and
technologies under patent. The very amendments proposed in this  regard  are
catered for in the Act.  The  amendments,  therefore,  do  not  represent  a
departure from current policy but are merely duplication of policy  that  is
already contained in the Act.

The  Bill  recommends  the  introduction   of   compulsory   licensing   for
noncommercial  use  of  patented  articles,  but  the  Patents  Act  already
provides state access to patented articles. It does so  in  three  sections:
section 4,  section  56  and  section  78.  There  are,  therefore,  various
procedures by which the state  may  acquire  rights  to  produce  goods  for
public purposes.

The amendment that Mrs  Kalyan  proposes,  therefore,  in  this  regard,  is
superfluous. In fact, the provisions in the  Act  give  the  state  broader,
more general access to patented rights than the limited  access  Mrs  Kalyan
proposes. What the hon  member  proposes,  therefore,  is  nothing  new  but
merely a poor duplication of what already exists in the Patents Act.

In addition, it has been a puzzle to most of us on the committee as  to  why
Mrs Kalyan would choose the  Board  of  Trade  and  Tariffs  to  fulfil  the
function of administering these matters. The BTT is the body that  evaluates
antidumping claims and regulates tariffs. In addition,  the  BTT  is  to  be
replaced  by  the  International  Trade  Administration  Commission.  It  is
envisaged that the ITAC will have a wider role in  Southern  Africa.  It  is
very  odd,  indeed,  that  a  body  with  transnational  responsibility  for
antidumping actions should be called upon to adjudicate in these matters.

Submitting patents to the ITAC  would  be  tantamount  to  giving  the  BLNS
countries, that is the Southern African Customs Union countries,  a  say  in
an issue that is  currently  an  exclusive  national  competence.  This  is,
perhaps, the weakest link in the entire Bill and it is a pity that  the  hon
member, when she spoke earlier, did not use her time  today  to  throw  some
light on this matter.

Another shortcoming is the proposal for compulsory licensing in the case  of
a national emergency. The Bill  does  not  define  national  emergency.  One
would, therefore, have  to  revert  to  a  formal  declaration  of  national
emergency in terms of the Constitution. Now, Mrs Kalyan is  clearly  unaware
that one of the key achievements of the developing  countries'  negotiations
at the WTO in Doha was to ensure that the use  of  compulsory  licences  was
not made dependent on the formal declaration of national emergency.
In terms of the Doha Declaration, each member has  the  right  to  determine
what constitutes a national emergency  or  other  circumstances  of  extreme
urgency. The formulation in the Bill would amount to a reversion to the pre-
Doha position. As a result of these and other flaws that I  have  indicated,
the committee quite correctly rejected the proposal.

The committee had far  more  sympathy  for  Mr  Bell's  proposal.  There  is
clearly  a  need  to  address  the  financial  difficulties  experienced  by
pensioners in maintaining medical scheme coverage after retirement. But,  as
our chairperson has indicated, the best avenue to do this is through  labour
legislation.

I would like to thank Mr Bell, however, for the responsible manner in  which
he approached this matter. Thank you. We support the report. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Chairperson, I  move  that  the
reports be adopted.

Motion agreed to (Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Reports accordingly adopted.
