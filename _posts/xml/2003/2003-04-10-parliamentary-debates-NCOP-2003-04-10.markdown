                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I give  notice  that  I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) noting that South Africa is a member of the UN  Commission  on  Human
       Rights, and is committed to multi-lateralism,  democracy,  peace  and
       justice in Africa -


       (a)  calls upon the Government  to  instruct  our  representative  in
           Geneva to support the  vote  to  continue  the  mandate  of  the
           Special Rapporteur on Human  Rights  for  the  Sudan,  which  is
           expected to take place in April;


       (b)  acknowledges that this is vital, because armed groups, supported
           by the Khartoum regime, continue to violate the lives,  property
           and safety of villagers in the oil rich areas in particular;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)   the  Sudan  government  and  the  Sudan   Peoples'   Liberation
           Movement/Army SPLM signed a memorandum of understanding  on  the
           cessation of hostilities on 15 October 2002, and  reaffirmed  it
           on 5 February 2003;
       (b)  the UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur reported on  12  November
           2002 that torture and harassment remained government  policy  in
           the Sudan; and


       (c)  because the peace process (Machakos Accord)  is  moving  towards
           resolving the conflict, it is  important  that  the  UN  Special
           Rapporteur remain in place.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter,  hiermee  gee  ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad die optrede van die militante beweging vir  grondlose  mense
  (LPM), wat met 'n uitdagende strategie begin het om boere  regstreeks  te
  pak oor die beweerde misbruik van werkers, verdoem, soos hy  ook  optrede
  van die regse ekstremiste verdoem wat vuisreg gebruik.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  at
the next sitting of the Council:


  That the House condemns the actions of  the  militant  Landless  People's
  Movement (LPM), which has initiated a defiant strategy to tackle  farmers
  directly about alleged abuse of workers, as it also condemns the  actions
  of the right-wing extremists who take the law into their own hands.]

              TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ASSASSINATION OF CHRIS HANI

                              (Draf Resolution)

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) acknowledges that today we  remember  the  10th  anniversary  of  the
       brutal assassination of our comrade Martin Thembisile Hani, known  as
       Chris Hani;
  (2) gives  due  recognition  to  the  courageous  efforts  of  a  comrade
       committed to the liberation of our country, to such an extent that he
       had to pay the ultimate price;


  (3) mourns the fact that he was ripped out of our lives on the eve of the
       country's first  democratic  elections,  through  the  actions  of  a
       coward;


  (4) realises that he will be fondly remembered  by  those  who  knew  and
       worked with him as an ordinary, humble man who always treated all  as
       a good friend; and


  (5) acknowledges that his death accelerated the advent  of  a  democratic
       order and thus fulfilled  our  dreams  of  a  non-sexist,  non-racial
       democracy.


       We still miss him and always will. Sleep well comrade Chris.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    CONDEMNATION OF ALL FORMS OF VIOLENCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns outright all forms of violence  against  all  people,  their
       properties and their future;


  (2) while condeming the continued violent invasion of Iraq, also condemns
       the cruel massacre of hundreds of people in Drodro in the  DRC,  east
       of Uganda;


  (3) is also  shocked  by  the  assault  of  farmers  and  farmworkers  in
       Zimbabwe;


  (4) calls upon the Government to continue to seek practical ways to  show
       solidarity with all victims, as it strives and helps to turn  enemies
       into friends; and


  (5) acknowledges that we all equally belong to one family - that  is  the
       human family - with a conscience.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                             (Review of policy)

Vote No 26 - Agriculture, and

Vote No 30 - Land Affairs:

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Chairperson and hon  members,
exactly ten years ago today, Comrade Chris Hani was  assasinated  -  a  year
before we attained our liberation. In his memory, we have worked  tirelessly
to change the lives of the rural masses and the workers in South Africa.

Our programme of land reform and agriculture is an example of  how  we  have
impacted on the rural community,  a  community  which  gave  birth  to  this
giant. We will continue  to  ensure  that  his  memory  and  those  of  whom
struggled with him, will be kept alive by what  we  do  to  transform  South
Africa for the better.

Today we had a memorial service for Comrade Senorita Ntlabati who  was  also
a member of this House. In her memory, we want to say:  The  work  you  have
done during your lifetime remains as a memory of what all  of  us  as  South
Africans need to do to change our country for the better.

Once a member of the Young Women  Christian  Association,  you  touched  and
changed the lives of so many young  women  in  the  Free  State  region  and
elsewhere in the country. We will remember you by ensuring that  your  hopes
and dreams are kept alive by what we will do.
A decade later, we stand proudly on the shoulders  of  giants  like  Comrade
Chris Hani and many of the  heroes  and  heroines  of  our  struggle  as  we
account for the mandate bestowed upon us by the people of  South  Africa  in
this sector of agriculture and land.

Only a year ago around this time, we stood here before this very  House  and
declared  our  resolute  and  relentless  determination   to   redress   the
imbalances of the past. Today we once  again  stand  here,  more  determined
than ever, to push back the frontiers of poverty  and  landlessness  in  our
country.

In 1994 we inherited an agricultural sector that was not inclusive  at  all,
and did not reflect the demography  of  our  society.  It  was  also  highly
regulated with subsidies and financial concessions available  to  commercial
farmers, often at a high cost  to  government.  Protectionist  policies  and
barriers to entry helped to distort the potential of this sector.  Thus,  at
the outset, we were faced with the enormous challenge of  transformation  of
this sector at  all  levels  by  ensuring  that  it  becomes  inclusive  and
competitive, and that  its  vision  is  that  of  ensuring  that  all  South
Africans have access to food at all times.

We needed to ensure that the rural communities, whose livelihood is  derived
from the land, are supported in such a way that they can make an  impact  on
their own development. These are the objectives that have led Government  to
come up with the Rural Development Strategy, amongst other programmes.

Poverty continues to be a challenge that we must address,  mindful  that  it
will take a bit of time, given the legacy of our past. In part, within  this
Ministry, it will require that we accelerate land reform in  order  to  give
people assets that they can put to use for economic  livelihood  and  social
stability.

Land reform, on the other hand,  will  ensure  that  we  change  the  skewed
participation of black  people  in  agriculture,  in  particular  women  and
youth. The Land and Agricultural Development Programme, known  as  LRAD,  is
one such mechanism that we have used to attain this objective.

To this end, we have been able to create a class of new farmers, both  young
and old, that are a success in our country. The  Nkomazi  Sugar  Project  in
Mpumalanga, where we launched our LRAD  programme  in  2001,  has,  for  the
first time, had its harvest and realised  an  income  of  R100  000,  beyond
their own expectations.

These are women, young people and men who nobody would  have  thought  could
become serious participants in the agricultural sector before. Some  of  the
beneficiaries of restitution have also shown positive results  where  people
who got their land back have been able to produce in such a way that it  has
impacted positively on their lives and their communities.

The work done so far in restitution has yielded good results. A total of  36
000 claims have been settled. Our validation campaign is almost complete  at
95%. We would like to thank the Belgian  government  for  their  support  in
this process. Our validation campaign has enabled us to know  exactly  which
claims are valid and which ones are not, out of those that are remaining.

Out of the total number that have been  validated,  400  have  not  met  our
criteria and, therefore, have been rejected. The balance that  is  remaining
is the challenge that we'll have to deal with within the timeframe that  our
President announced last year.

Restitution is not the only programme of Government.  The  other  programmes
are redistribution and tenure reform. It is within  these  programmes  where
there is a need for an interface between agriculture and  land  as  well  as
land and housing. The work we have done so far as these two  departments  at
national level has been  to  ensure  that  there  is  an  alignment  in  our
planning as well as the implementation of our projects at local level.

We have also had interactions with  provincial  departments  of  agriculture
and provincial offices of land affairs to ensure that  the  members  of  the
executive councils entrusted with agriculture are part  and  parcel  of  the
approval  of  projects  that  have  to  be  implemented   for   agricultural
development arising  out  of  land  reform  in  particular.  This  has  been
essential to ensure that there is  an  alignment  at  all  levels,  both  in
planning and implementation, because it is our view that unless we do so  we
can never succeed.

We are currently working with Salga at local level  to  ensure  that  indeed
the majority of these projects  form  part  of  the  Integrated  Development
Plans so that all of us, as  the  three  spheres  of  government,  can  work
towards a common objective so that, indeed, our impact on the work  that  we
do can be realised at local level.

This alignment, however, cannot only be done  or  expected  to  be  done  by
Government alone. It would need partnerships at  various  levels.  It  would
need partnerships from the private sector as well as civil  society.  It  is
this knowledge that has  necessitated  a  partnership  between  farmers  and
Government, which has been reflected through the agriculture sector plan.

I'm happy to report to this House that my colleagues the provincial MECs  of
agriculture  seated  here  today  have  taken  this  sector  plan  to  their
provincial executive councils, and they have been able to debate with  their
colleagues to solicit support which can make this plan a  success.  However,
they have also been  able  to  ensure  that  the  provincial  structures  of
farmers' organisations, some  of  which  are  not  represented  by  national
organisations, also buy into this plan, because indeed,  unless  all  of  us
can work towards a common objective, we can never succeed.

Important has been the resourcing  of  agriculture  at  all  levels.  We  at
national level undertook a discussion with Treasury  last  year  for  us  to
ensure that we do  a  proper  analysis  of  the  expenditure  trend  in  the
agricultural  sector,  and  of  how  our  provincial  and  national  budgets
contribute to agriculture.

This analysis has just been published as Chapter 7 of the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Review. We undertook this exercise in order to  give  effect  to  the
principle of alignment of programmes across all  spheres  of  government  in
order to increase our gains in moving the sector to unity and prosperity.

The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review reveals that the  emergent  agricultural
sector is constrained by issues of land, access to water and quality  farmer
support services for them to become productive and viable.  The  review  has
also indicated that the expenditure trend in  agriculture  continues  to  be
skewed towards the financing of  personnel  costs  rather  than  development
priorities in the sector, particularly in the poorer provinces.

This continues to be a matter of concern for us which we  must  continue  to
work towards reversing.

I can assure you, hon members and Chairperson, that my  MECs  and  heads  of
department will indeed look at this report of the  intergovernmental  review
and together find a way in which  we  can  make  sure  that  the  spread  of
agricultural expenditure goes where it is needed most, particularly  amongst
the poorest of our provinces.

It is important to note that the analysis provides us with a  positive  view
with respect to expenditure on extension,  which  stands  at  41,2%  of  the
total Agricultural budget. I must say that this  is  an  important  element,
because it is where we interface with our farmers  in  being  able  to  give
them goods, service and advice so that they know what they ought to do,  but
we are also mindful that this sector is an area in  which  we  need  to  put
more of our efforts in terms of training and  ensuring  that  we  build  the
capacity of those extension officers so that they  can  make  an  impact  in
this competitive environment.

Veterinary services, on the other hand, which we all  know  are  a  critical
element of our work and serve to provide healthy and safe  food,  both  from
animal and plant products, and which are one  of  the  areas  of  regulatory
services that enable us to access our international  market,  are  indicated
in this review as one of those areas that still remain underfunded. I  think
our provincial MECs, together with the executive councils and with the  help
of the members in this House, would be able to relook at this area,  because
unless we are able to give enough resources  and  capacity,  we  would  have
serious challenges in  ensuring  that  we  have  a  prosperous  agricultural
sector in our country.

In addition, research and education and training are  also  important  areas
which will enable our sector to achieve competitiveness. It is also  another
area in terms of the  fiscal  review  that  indicates  underfunding  from  a
number of  provinces.  It  will  require  that  all  of  us,  together  with
yourselves as legislators, can influence the manner in which we are able  to
prepare our budgets in such a way  that  resources  are  directed  to  those
areas that are of more concern. These would include extension  services  and
veterinary services, as I've indicated, and training and research.

I would like to indicate to you, hon members, that  at  national  Government
level we have earmarked about R5,3 million that  was  put  aside  towards  a
bursary scheme which will start in the coming year. This will enable  us  to
target scarce skills that we are short of in our  economy,  particularly  in
the agricultural sector. That would be your veterinary sciences, as well  as
agricultural engineering and economics.

I indicated earlier the importance of the  sector  plan.  We  have  to  this
extent  put  away  an  amount  of  about  R3,7 million  that  we   will   be
transferring to almost all the provinces, which  will  help  as  a  training
component to ensure that indeed our comprehensive farmer support package  is
improved.

We know that provinces on their own have earmarked some resources, but  also
it is our view that national Government needs to contribute to  this  level.
For the 2003-04 budget we have also allocated about R10 million towards  the
support of provinces as they do their farmer support work.

The issues of poverty in our society are always reflected by the  levels  of
hunger and malnutrition. At Government level we have agreed that there is  a
need for an integrated food security and  nutrition  programme.  As  I  have
indicated in the National Assembly, an amount was put  aside  by  Government
which will go  towards  assisting  those  who  are  vulnerable  amongst  our
communities to be able to get food parcels as a form of emergency  aid,  but
at the same time they will be followed  by  the  agricultural  sector  packs
that would ensure sustainability.

In our meeting of the 28th of March 2003 when  we  had  a  joint  Minmec  of
Health, Agriculture and Social Development,  it  was  clear  that  provinces
themselves have identified food security as one of the  challenges  that  we
need to deal with. A majority of provinces, in all three these  departments,
have put aside resources to ensure that we can meet this challenge.
However, what we have all agreed upon is the importance of co-ordination  at
provincial level and also between provincial and national as well  as  local
government, so that when we deliver this programme, we do so in such  a  way
that we impact positively on those communities.

I am also happy to announce that we  are  undertaking  a  pilot  project  on
training our extension officers  on  weather  and  climate  usage.  We  have
started in Mpumalanga province and we  will  continue  in  other  provinces,
because it is our view that the understanding of the  area  of  weather  and
climate is important to  support  our  farmers  to  make  choices  that  are
appropriate so that, indeed, they will not find themselves  in  a  difficult
situation with regard to risks in the agricultural sector.

We have always indicated that as we are  working  in  the  agricultural  and
land affairs sector, sustainable resource management  remains  critical.  We
started a programme which has now become a household name  in  a  number  of
areas, which we  know  as  LandCare,  in  partnership  with  the  Australian
government. This is about managing our land as well as  managing  our  water
resources so that we can preserve them for today's generation  and  for  the
future.

In the Limpopo province, through our watercare programme, we have been  able
to rehabilitate about 171 irrigation schemes, and out of the 171  there  are
about 28 schemes that have been completed and are working, which  have  made
it possible for 4 000 ha  of  land  covering  a  community  of  about  3 500
farmers in Dinglydale, New Forest - in the  Bushbuckridge  area  -  in  Metz
Madlera, Mopani; in Cape  Thorn,  Veribe,  and  in  Tabina,  Tzaneen  to  be
supported.

Whilst the national department has made a contribution of R4 million,  I  am
pleased to  announce  that  the  provincial  department  of  agriculture  in
Limpopo  in  particular  has  put  aside  about  R25 million   towards   the
rehabilitation of the schemes that are remaining. [Interjections.]

Through our collaboration with Public Works, an  additional  R7 million  was
made available over the past  two  years  to  support  community  production
centres, some in Lambase in the Eastern  Cape  and  others  in  Limpopo  and
other provinces. This collaboration has enabled us as Government to  find  a
better way of working in an integrated way  so  that  the  little  resources
that we have can help to improve our situation at local level.

We do have agricultural agencies such as the Agricultural Research  Council,
the Land Bank and Onderstepoort Biological Products Ltd, together  with  the
National Agricultural Marketing Council and the Perishable  Products  Export
Control Board, or PPECB, which  are  important  elements  to  assist  us  to
improve the level of our capacity.

I wish to indicate, hon members, that OBP Ltd, which you  once  knew  as  an
ailing institution, has been able to turn itself around and today is one  of
those agencies that  are  making  a  profit  and  are  able  to  fund  their
operations. But also, it is this important  institute  that  enables  us  to
produce vaccines that can deal with animal diseases that exist not  only  in
our country, but also on the rest of the continent.

We have also been able to access international markets such as  Italy,  from
where specific vaccines have been ordered from OBP Ltd, our own company.  It
is our view that the expansion that OBP Ltd envisages will go a long way  in
making South Africa an important player in biotechnology in the region.

I also want to indicate that we have done some work with the Land  Bank.  As
you know, we have passed the Land and Agricultural Development Bank Act.  It
has assisted us to ensure that we put some focus on the development  of  new
farmers. I'm happy to indicate to this House that we have been able  to  put
aside resources and have been  able  to  give  about  four  farms  to  youth
programmes, one of which we launched in the Northern Cape and the others  in
the Free State area. It is our view that if we  start  impacting  positively
on young people in the agricultural sector, we  would  be  able  to  have  a
future for food security in our country.
Without boring you, I want to indicate that from the  little  of  what  I've
said which indicates progress, it is clear that we are on the  path  towards
transformation of our society. It is our view that  we  have  been  able  to
keep the promise to our people and that indeed we have  delivered  the  land
back to its rightful owners. With regard to areas  where  we  may  not  have
come, it is our view that we will be able to do so in the near future.

I wish to thank members of  this  House,  my  colleagues  the  MECs  present
today, members of the select  committee  and  chairperson  Moatshe  for  the
leadership you have always given and for the encouragement  and  support  to
make sure that we always amaze ourselves and do better each year. I wish  to
thank the Deputy Minister who has been a pillar of strength  as  my  support
to ensure that indeed, particularly in the areas of the  law  -  I'm  not  a
legal fundi - he's able to give  us  good  advice  that  can  enable  us  to
deliver better services to all of  you.  I  would  also  want  to  thank  my
director-general, the deputy directors-general and all the staff - both  the
staff who work in our offices and departments, and in the parastatals -  for
the commitment that they've shown to make us become such a winning  team.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

[Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, the Minister for Agriculture and Land  Affairs,
the  Chief  Whip  of  the  NCOP,  members  of   the   NCOP,   premiers   and
representatives from provinces, I welcome you all  to  the  introduction  of
the budget for the department.]

Chairperson, allow me to quote from the Book of Books.


  Then God said, ``I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face  of  the
  whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They  will  be
  yours for food. And to all the beasts of the earth and all the  birds  of
  the air and all the creatures that move on the ground -  everything  that
  has the breath of life in it - I give every green plant for  food.''  And
  it was so. God saw all that he had made, and it was very good.

Further on the Book states and I quote:


  Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat of
  it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you
  and you will eat the plants of the field. By the sweat of your  brow  you
  will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you  were
  taken; for dust you are and to dust you will return.

This is the authenticity of  where  agriculture  and  land  issues  emanated
from.

(Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, indeed the frontiers of poverty  have  been  here  since  time
immemorial. Greediness  of  a  creature  called  a  human  being  aggravates
poverty and suffering and leads to people failing  to  have  food  on  their
tables. Unity is the power. Let us work hard and push back the frontiers  of
poverty in South Africa.]

As a  result  of  decades  of  dispossession  and  racist  land  laws,  land
distribution in South Africa is among the most highly skewed in  the  world,
with large capital intensive farms dominating much of the rural  areas.  The
Government has  introduced  a  market-based  land  redistribution  programme
which provides grants and technical assitance to the landless poor.  Several
mechanisms have been used  to  date  to  enable  prospective  purchasers  to
acquire land, from direct purchase to  a  variety  of  equity  schemes.  The
Government has also introduced a programme of tenure reform  which  aims  to
bring all people occupying land under a  validated  system  of  landholding.
The Government has also initiated a programme of restitution of  land  which
involves returning or otherwise compensating  victims  of  land  lost  since
June 1913 because of racially discriminatory laws.

The Land Affairs White Paper of 1995 sets out the vision and  implementation
strategy for South  Africa's  land  policy.  The  policy  intends  to  build
reconciliation and stability, contribute  to  economic  growth  and  enhance
household welfare. Thus the Government's land reform programme, as  depicted
in the White Paper, aims to address these past injustices.

When we deal with agriculture in the economy, the challenge is to  establish
policies  which  will  ensure  that  agriculture  constitutes  the  national
economic policy objectives articulated in the RDP and  now  encapsulated  in
the Gear strategy. These objectives are firstly, economic  growth,  reducing
income inequalities, especially along racial lines and eliminating  poverty.
The purpose of agricultural policy reforms articulated in  the  foreword  is
to ensure that agriculture contributes to these national objectives  through
the following: An increase in agricultural  productivity  and  output  which
will enhance the sector's contribution to the national economic  growth,  an
increase in the incomes  of  the  poorest  groups  in  society  through  the
creation of opportunities for small and medium scale farmers to raise  their
production for own consumption and the market, the  creation  of  additional
employment opportunities in agriculture  and  an  improvement  in  household
food security through expanded production and a more equitable  distribution
of resources.

The challenges foreseen by the agricultural sector are  part  of  a  broader
process of rural development, which  includes  land  reform,  investment  in
water supply and transport infrastructure and an  improved  social  services
delivery. These are intended to contribute to  achieving  the  aims  of  the
RDP.

The four major goals for policy  reform  are:  To  build  an  efficient  and
internationally competitive agricultural sector, to  support  the  emergence
of a more a diverse structure of production with a  large  increase  in  the
numbers  of   successful   smallhold   farming   enterprise,   to   conserve
agricultural  natural  resources  and  to  put   in   place   policies   and
institutions for sustainable resource use.

The Cabinet identified agriculture as a key  sector  that  requires  special
attention because of its  potential  to  contribute  to  the  objectives  of
higher economic growth. Within this framework, the specific  challenges  for
the agricultural sector are  to  implement  a  farmer  settlement  programme
including  joint  ventures  in  high  value  and  exploitable   agricultural
products, to design a comprehensive support  package  for  new  entrants  to
ensure  improved  agricultural  productivity  and,  through  investment   in
research, to facilitate the development of new products, to  facilitate  and
co-ordinate infrastructure  support  to  agriculture,  and  to  enhance  the
national regulatory systems.

This is agriculture and land  without  which  nobody  can  survive.  Working
together with provincial departments of agriculture and other  stakeholders,
the  Department  of  Agriculture  developed  a  integrated   food   security
framework. This calls for a multi-disciplinary  approach  acknowledging  the
problems of food security which go beyond production concerns.

Linked to the issue of food security at national  level,  is  an  initiative
that practically addresses food insecurity problems, both  in  South  Africa
and the rest of Africa. The  Food  and  Agricultural  Organisations  of  the
United Nations launched the Telefood Campaign  in  1997.  It  is  an  annual
campaign of broadcasts, concerts and other events. The money raised  through
the Telefood campaigns pays for small sustainable projects that help  small-
scale farmers produce more food for  their  families  and  communities.  The
campaign incorporates fund-raising and awareness  of  food  security.  Funds
raised at these campaigns will be donated to FAO projects in  Africa,  South
Africa included.

At the moment there are  many  programmes  and  projects  running  in  South
Africa in which poor and hungry people in urban and  rural  communities  are
taught the simplest,  grass-roots,  virtually-no-cost  method  of  restoring
life and fertility to  poor  soil  for  producing  food.  Another  important
component of the food gardens project is the encouragement of micro  farmers
who are most often unemployed persons  who  have  turned  to  organic  micro
farming  as  a  way  of  supporting  their  families.  Micro  farmers   grow
vegetables on very small areas of land from as little as  10  square  meters
to 500 square meters in backyards, under power lines, on school grounds  and
in the bush.

The  initial  phase  of  the  project  comprises  survival   gardens   where
vegetables are planted for people's basic needs. Thereafter, with  technical
support and skills, substistence gardens emerge that produce excess food  to
sell. It would be wise if the Deputy Minister could  advise  people  in  his
response on how to access seeds on the ground as a way of encouraging  these
gardens that will sustain our nation.

The extent to which aquaculture can  help  to  reduce  poverty  is  a  major
policy question. Aquaculture can contribute to the livelihood  of  the  poor
through improved  food  supply,  employment  and  income.  Many  small-scale
farmers have small land holdings in areas  of  complex,  diverse  and  risk-
prone agriculture in mainly rain-fed and undulating land on the  fringes  of
lowlands  or  in  uplands.  Construction  of  a  pond  on  these  frequently
environmentally  degraded  farms  may  also  provide  a  focal   point   for
agricultural diversification and increased  sustainability  by  providing  a
resource of water.

The poor in well-endowed lowlands are often  landless  or  nearly  landless.
Here fish farming in common water bodies may reduce poverty,  provided  that
the poor can access them. Inland and coastal fishers  are  usually  landless
and amongst the most  impoverished.  Their  opportunities  lie  mainly  with
water-based culture systems.

Therefore aquaculture may simply  be  defined  as  farming  fish  and  other
aquatic organisms.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  member,
your speaking time has expired.

Rev P MOATSHE: Thank you, Chairperson. I wish to  thank  the  Minister,  the
department for co-operating, the MECs' we interact with  in  the  provinces,
my committee and everyone in this House. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members,
when the Rev Moatshe started speaking, he quoted from the Book of Life.  But
he deliberately did not mention the chapter or verse he was quoting. He  has
sent me a note asking me to check whether members knew  from  which  chapter
he had quoted. My reply is that I know that we all go to church  very  often
and we do read the Bible. Therefore, I am not going to ask this question.

Mr  P  NKAYI  (Eastern  Cape):  Thank  you,  hon  Chairperson,  Chairperson,
Minister and Deputy Minister, the MECs, my colleagues, members of the  House
and guests, I greet  you  this  afternoon.  It  is  a  pleasure  for  me  to
contribute to this important debate on behalf of my province.

The dynamic economic and food security approach to  agrarian  transformation
must be led and informed by an aggressive campaign to prevent  environmental
degradation which is leading  to  massive  depletion  of  essential  natural
resources and the destruction of natural processes that  ultimately  sustain
life on earth. If this is allowed to continue,  it  will  have  catastrophic
consequences for future generations. It  is  therefore  imperative  for  our
province to take both land and soil erosion seriously.

The Department of Agriculture in the Eastern  Cape  has  invested  over  R50
million in resource-management and  wide-ranging  activities  to  make  sure
that this programme becomes  a  community-based  natural-resource-management
project. In the area of  Lady  Frere  we  have  effectively  controlled  the
Nasela  shrubs.  Major  soil  erosion  work  is  being  implemented  in  the
Cofimvaba,  Tsolo  and  Tsomo  districts.   In   the   Lusikisiki   district
sustainable minimum tillage practices have been demonstrated,  resulting  in
an improved crop-management system.

A major land reclamation system is  being  implemented  in  the  Middledrift
district  and  the  acclaimed  integrated  livestock  and  crop  development
programme, managed in conjunction with National Wool  Growers'  Association,
continue to demonstrate the benefit of  sustainable  management  of  grazing
and the improvement of wool quality and value in due  course.  Our  communal
farmers are going to be the leaders, not only in our province, but  also  in
the country, in the production of wool to support food security.

Very  expensive  projects  were  implemented  at  a  cost  of   R35 million,
including the erection of over 2 300 km  of  fencing.  More  than  50  local
contractors and subcontractors were engaged  in  these  projects,  employing
over 5 000 unskilled  workers.  These  projects  facilitate  both  crop  and
lifestock, and companies are owned predominantly by women.

In the revitalisation of agricultural schemes in Qamata, over  500  hectares
of maize were planted, using modern  commercial  methods  and  centre  pivot
irrigation systems. The province has a capacity of producing  600  000  tons
of maize, but at the moment we are producing less.

Now I come to livestock improvement. The department has embarked on a  drive
to improve the genetic  herds.  Genetically  improved  rams  and  bulls  are
selectively  being  introduced  in  communal  areas,  under  controlled  and
improved management. The partnership  between  the  National  Wool  Growers'
Association  and  the  Agricultural  Research  Council,  together  with  the
department, has been injected with R4,2 million for the same  project.  From
January this year, 3 200 rams are being distributed in the communities.
Farmers are  now  getting  R45,69  per  kilogram  for  wool  that  has  been
transformed from a poor quality to a  far  better  quality.  Therefore,  the
increase in the price of wool has helped the farmers a great  deal  and  has
created an environment where a better life for  farmers  can  be  sustained.
The whole industry is likely  to  be  rejuvenated  because  of  this,  at  a
glance, seemingly insignificant step.

In the case of primary animal health, sheep scab in our  province  is  under
control. A total of 3,2 million sheep were innoculated  in  2002.  The  wool
clip has gone up, the lamb crop has  improved  by  20%  and  there  is  more
mutton per carcass.

Our total budget for 2003-04 is R735 million, of which R444 million will  be
spent on personnel-related costs. A total of R190 million is still  required
to  support  additional  staff  to  the   department's   requirements.   Our
nonpersonnel expenditure amounts to R291 million of the total  budget,  with
the major focus on service delivery in this financial year.  Sevent  million
rand  is  allocated  to  massive  food  production,  including  a   once-off
allocation to turn around the Magwa Tea Estate. This massive project has  as
its primary objectives an increase in food production particularly in  maize
and other staple food; the  establishment  of  rural  entrepreneurs  through
mechanisation and tractor schemes; ensuring food security for  approximately
2 000 rural agricultural centres and the planting of suitable crops in  both
the maize triangle in the province and other high value crops elsewhere.  An
estimate of 1,2 million people, through the food security programme, over  a
period of five years, will be engaged.

Livestock improvement and animal health is the  foundation  of  agricultural
business development in this province. A budget  of  R28  million  has  been
allocated to this area. This includes dip and vaccines, and the  improvement
of genetic herds.

In order to fast-track the success achieved by the  National  Wool  Growers'
Association and its alliance, we have ensured that the  Eastern  Cape  makes
its mark in the wool market. A further R4,5 million has  been  allocated  to
this programme in this financial year.

Protection of the environment is the cornerstone of  the  development  of  a
vibrant agriculture in our province.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  R22,5
million has been allocated to land care, production  and  soil  conservation
this year.

In the financial years 2001-02  and  2002-03  we  have  taken  the  national
Female Farmer of the Year award. [Interjections.]  We  are  now  challenging
the provinces of our country to prepare much better than they  have  in  the
past two years, because we are on the course to  take  this  award  for  the
third time.

HON MEMBERS: No ways! No ways!

Mr P NKAYI (Eastern Cape): In the agricultural sector the tide  has  turned.
We are not only ambitious of our projects, but we are  also  confident  that
we will continue to yield.

In conclusion, in this financial year there are areas of significant  focus,
namely development of land  administration,  designated  agricultural  areas
and natural resource conservation.

It is my pleasure to support not only this budget, but also  the  endeavours
of the national Minister in the creation of a  better  life  for  all  South
Africans. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mev A M VERSFELD: Voorsitter en Minister,  dit  is  vir  my  'n  voorreg  om
vandag aan hierdie begrotingsposbespreking deel te neem,  en  ek  wil  graag
konsentreer op landbounavorsing.

So twee jaar gelede het ek ook in dié Raad gepraat oor landbounavorsing,  en
spesifiek verwys na die Direktoraat: Veeartsenykunde, en  ook  na  die  feit
dat die meeste van ons veeartse deesdae verkies om in  Kenia  te  gaan  werk
omdat die werkomstandighede daar vir hulle beter is. Die  situasie  het  die
afgelope paar jaar dramaties verswak, en alhoewel daar in dié  begroting  'n
toename in finansiering is, is dit maar slegs 60%  van  wat  dit  sewe  jaar
gelede was.

President  Mbeki  het   baie   duidelik   gestel   dat   ondersteuning   aan
landbounavorsing  verhoog  moet  word  tot  3%  van  die   bruto   nasionale
landbouproduk, pleks van die huidige onderbesteding van  slegs  1%  van  die
bruto nasionale  landbouproduk.  As  die  staat  landbounavorsing  met  300%
verhoog, sal die Regering die huidige navorsers kan  behou,  sal  hulle  kan
uitbrei, én sal daar nog nuwe  navorsing  en  navorsingtelers  kan  bykom  -
byvoorbeeld  om  genoeg  geld  beskikbaar   te   stel   vir   navorsing   by
universiteite   om   vir   ons   navorsers   op   te   lei,   spesifiek   in
voedselproduksie. Dit sou goed wees indien dit kon  geskied  in  samewerking
en in wisselwerking met die Landbounavorsingsraad, en nie ten koste van  die
Landbounavorsingsraad nie. Voedselsekerheid moet geleidelik begin plek  maak
vir voedselselfvoorsiening, veral in die Afrikakonteks.

Terwyl ons byna die helfte minder  navorsers  het  as  sewe  tot  nege  jaar
gelede  -  daar  was  in  daardie  stadium  omtrent  400  doktore   in   die
Landbounavorsingsraad, waar daar nou slegs 100 oor is - is  die  hoofkantoor
en die hoofstrukture besig  om  in  getalle  te  groei.  Die  finansies  vir
navorsing daal, terwyl dié vir administrasie en  personeel  styg.  Dit  laat
vir my nogal ernstige vrae hieroor ontstaan, byvoorbeeld,  hoekom  daar  nog
nie 'n nuwe Landbounavorsingsraad aangestel is wat in die nuwe  boekjaar  op
dreef gaan wees nie? By 'n vorige geleentheid het die Minister verwys na  'n
tussentydse raad, en 'n tussentydse voorsitter.

Ek verstaan ook dat die navorsers van die  Landbounavorsingsraad  twee  jaar
gelede laas 'n verhoging gehad het. Dit is nie net dít nie: hulle  word  ook
'n skaal laer betaal as elke ander navorsingsraad  in  Suid-Afrika.  As  dit
waar is en as dit so is, sou ek graag van die Minister wil weet waarom.

Dit is ontstellend om te dink dat navorsing,  wat  onontbeerlik  is  in  die
proses van voedselsekuriteit en selfvoorsiening,  hierdie  behandeling  kry.
Is dit dalk  omdat  die  persepsie  bestaan  dat  die  Landbounavorsingsraad
hoofsaaklik betrokke is by kommersiële boere?  Sou  dit  so  wees,  sou  die
Landbounavorsingsraad  nie  vandag  kon  spog  met   die   twee   Mpumelelo-
toekennings  vir   landbouontwikkeling,   sowel   as   die   opleiding   van
kleinskaalse boere én die toekenning vir Vroulike Boer  van  die  Jaar  nie.
Minister,  al  die  sektore  in  die   Suid-Afrikaanse   landbou   het   die
Landbounavorsingsraad nodig.

Wintergraan, en dit is die  streek  waar  ek  hoofsaaklik  vandaan  kom,  se
navorsing is in dié stadium betreklik op dreef,  in  teenstelling  met  baie
van die ander navorsingsbene. Die rede hiervoor is dat  die  bron  van  geld
die statutêre heffing is wat direk  na  die  Wintergraannavorsingstrust  toe
gaan. Dit is 'n uitstekende struktuur wat bestaan uit  12  lede,  waarvan  u
ses aangewys het, en ses deur die bedryf aangewys is. Hierdie bedryf is  ook
baie dankbaar teenoor die Minister dat die heffing op koring goedgekeur  is,
en dat dit nou gestyg het van R4,50 tot R7,50 per ton, en  dit  sal  nou  so
wees vir die volgende vier jaar.

Voorsitter, die Wintergraannavorsingstrust  het  'n  onafhanklike  ondersoek
laat doen deur ene mnr Ian Edwards. Hy is 'n Australiër, wat 'n  kundige  is
in graannavorsing en ook in Australië se navorsingsraad  dien.  Mnr  Edwards
het bevind dat ons in Suid-Afrika genoodsaak sal wees om ons eie  koringsaad
te teel, en om saad te teel, is nie sommer iets wat elke ou  kan  doen  nie,
en telers word nie sommer agter elke bos uitgeskop nie. U sien, daar is  nie
geld te maak uit  koringsaad  in  die  vrye  handel  nie,  omdat  koring  'n
selfbestuiwende gewas  is.  Daarom  moet  daar  dus  'n  goed  gefinansierde
navorsingteelprogram bestaan, want die opkomende sektor vind  baie  baat  by
die totale aanwending van die finansies in  die  wintergraanopset,  juis  as
gevolg van die samestelling van die trust. Daar is ook  spesifieke  projekte
wat  wel  finansiering  ontvang  vir  navorsing  en  tegnologie-oordrag  aan
bestaansboere.

Die  Suid-Afrikaanse  landbou,  beide  in  die  geval  van  kommersiële   en
bestaansboere, se voortbestaan hang af van  goeie  navorsing.  Die  DA  doen
vandag 'n beroep op die Minister, en vra dat die Minister dit asseblief  nie
moet verwaarloos of vervang  nie.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mrs A M VERSFELD: Chairperson and Minister, it is a  privilege  for  me  to
participate in the discussion of this  Vote  today,  and  I  would  like  to
concentrate on agricultural research.

About two years  ago  I  also  addressed  this  Council  about  agricultural
research, and specifically referred to the Directorate:  Veterinary  Science
and also to the fact that these days most of the veterinary surgeons  prefer
to go and work in Kenya  because  over  there  the  working  conditions  are
better for them. Over the past few  years  the  situation  has  deteriorated
dramatically, and although in this budget there is an increase  in  funding,
it is merely 60% of what it was seven years ago.

President Mbeki made it clear that support for agricultural research  should
be increased to 3% of the agricultural gross  national  product  instead  of
the current underspending of just 1% of the gross national product.  If  the
state increased agricultural research by 300%, the Government will  be  able
to maintain the current researchers,  expand,  and  include  even  more  new
research and research  cultivators  -  for  example  to  make  enough  money
available  for  research  at  universities   to   train   our   researchers,
particularly in food production. It would be good if this could happen  with
the  co-operation  of,  and  interaction,  with  the  Agricultural  Research
Council, and not at  the  expense  of  the  Agricultural  Research  Council.
Gradually food security should start making way for  food  self-sufficiency,
especially in the African context.

While we have almost less than half of the researchers than  seven  to  nine
years ago - at that stage there were about 400 doctors in  the  Agricultural
Research Council, of which only 100 are now left - the head office and  main
structures are still  growing  in  numbers.  The  funding  for  research  is
decreasing while the funding for administration and  staff  are  increasing.
In my view this raises rather serious concerns. For example, why has  a  new
Agricultural Research  Council  not  been  appointed  as  yet  for  the  new
financial year? On a previous occassion the Minister referred to an  interim
council, and an interim chairperson.

I also understand that the researchers of the Agricultural Research  Council
have not received an increase in the last two years. It is  not  only  this,
they are also paid on a scale lower  than  any  other  research  council  in
South Africa. If this is true, and if it is the case, I would like  to  know
from the Minister why.

It is alarming to think that such research, which is  indispensable  to  the
process of  food  security  and  self-sufficiency,  receives  this  kind  of
treatment.  Is  it  perhaps  because  the   perception   exists   that   the
Agricultural Research Council is mainly involved  with  commercial  farmers?
If that were the case the Agricultural  Research  Council  would  not  today
have been able to  show  off  its  two  Mpumelelo  awards  for  agricultural
development, as well as the training of small farmers, and the female  award
for the Farmer of the Year. Minister, all  the  sectors  in  agriculture  in
South Africa need the Agricultural Research Council.

Research on winter wheat, and this is mainly the region where I  come  from,
is at this stage reasonably in place, in  contrast  to  many  of  the  other
areas of research. The reason for this is that the source of income  is  the
statutory levy which is going directly to the Winter Wheat  Research  Trust.
This is an excellent structure comprising of 12 members, of which  six  were
appointed by you, and six were appointed by the industry. This  industry  is
also very grateful to the Minister for approving  the  levy  on  wheat,  and
that it has now increased from R4,50 to R7,50 per tonne, and this is how  it
is now going to be for the next four years.

Chairperson,  the  Winter  Wheat  Research   Trust   has   commissioned   an
independent investigation by a certain Mr Ian Edwards. He is  an  Australian
who is a specialist  in  wheat  research  and  also  serves  on  Australia's
research council. Mr Edwards has found that here in South Africa we will  be
compelled to cultivate our own wheat seeds, and to  cultivate  seed  is  not
something  that  anyone  can  do,  and  cultivators  cannot  be  found  just
everywhere. You see, on the free market money cannot  be  generated  through
wheat  seed,  because  wheat  is  a  self-pollinating  crop.  There   should
therefore be a well-financed research  cultivating  programme,  because  the
emerging sector benefits a great deal from the  overall  employment  of  the
funds in the winter wheat set-up precisely as a result  of  the  composition
of the trust. There are also specific projects which  indeed  receive  funds
for transferring research and technology to subsistence farmers.

The survival of agriculture in South Africa, in the case of both  commercial
and subsistence farmers, depends on good research. The  DA  appeals  to  the
Minister today, and requests that the Minister should please not neglect  or
replace it. I thank you.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Hon  Minister,  I  stand  here  before  this
House, not as Chief Whip of the National Council  of  Provinces,  but  as  a
duly mandated delegate from the North West province, and  I  convey  to  you
the apologies  of  our  very  energetic  MEC,  Edna  Molewa,  who  is  today
delivering the budget  speech  in  the  North  West  legislature.  So  I  am
conveying apologies to both you and the  Deputy  Minister  for  her  absence
here.

I've heard the MEC from the Eastern Cape  boast  about  the  Farmer  of  the
Year, but I think in the North West we  have  produced  a  most  significant
farmer, the best  Female  Farmer  of  the  Year  in  the  category  National
Markets, and that is none other  than  Nancy  Rakotoa.  We  challenge  other
provinces to ensure that they develop the appropriate strategies to  empower
women within strategic schemes within the provinces.

Chairperson, I'm glad the hon Minister  quoted  from  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal  Review.  It's  a  very  important  document,  and  Chapter   7,   in
particular, would have relevance to the work of the  Select  Committee  that
is dealing with this matter, and to this Council as a whole. We  would  like
to convey to both  the  Minister  and  the  Deputy  Minister  that  we  have
dedicated the next provincial week to  land  and  agriculture.  Amongst  the
issues that we are going to deal with when we visit the nine provinces  will
be land restitution and redistribution, and  agricultural  development  from
the perspective of black economic empowerment, in  terms  of  food  security
and other issues such as capacity development. We will be  informed  by  the
strategic plans of  the  national  Department,  and  enquire  and  ascertain
whether, in fact, the provinces and local goverment's plan are in  alignment
with that of National Government, and I think we have  a  responsibility  in
this regard. So, the relevant document will form  part  and  parcel  of  the
briefing documents which we will take to the various provinces  for  further
consideration.

From the North West, we are also concerned about the fact that a  large  sum
of money, or a large percentage of the budget that  has  been  allocated  to
the provinces, is utilised for personnel expenditure. The  North  West,  for
example, spends about 68,6% of its budget  on  personnel.  This  is  largely
owing to the bloated public  service  that  it  inherited  from  the  former
homeland Bophuthatswana, and corrective measures are being  taken  in  order
to reduce the personnel budget and ensure that more funds are  allocated  to
the appropriate strategic requirements.  Quite  interestingly,  80%  of  the
budget is allocated to the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, the North  West  and
Limpopo. All these provinces have  a  history  of  bloated  public  services
which they had inherited from the homeland system, and it is important  that
we give urgent attention to this matter. As we go to the provinces  we  will
have  to  enquire  what  positive  steps  are  being  initiated  within  the
provinces to rationalise or correct the situation in relation  to  personnel
costs.

As a spokesperson for the North West, it is important for me  to  understand
the profile of our province. We all know that  it  is  predominantly  rural,
but 58% of our land is being used for grazing, as we speak  right  now,  and
the mainstay of our crops is in fact maize  28%  is  for  cropping,  6%  for
nature  conservation  and  8%  is  used  for  other   purposes.   Obviously,
agriculture becomes a very, very important sector  in  economic  development
that affects the lives of our people. Therefore a particular focus has  been
given to this very important area, and it would appear as if  the  MEC  that
we now have for agriculture is imbued with the same energy and  spirit  that
we have in our hon Minister.

In relation to enhancing equitable access  and  participation  we  recognise
that  there  has  been  a  skewed  distribution  of  produce  in  terms   of
agricultural resources, and that the provincial government has had  to  take
corrective  steps  in  order  to  rectify  that.  To  this  end,  they  have
established land reform offices and of the 15 farms that are  in  possession
of Government, 11 have been  leased  with  the  necessary  capacity-building
initiatives being provided to emerging farmers to ensure that  we  not  only
provide them with land, but  that  we  provide  emerging  farmers  with  the
appropriate skills and capacity to ensure  that  the  arable  land  that  is
provided to them, or leased to them, is utilised meaningfully. This ties  up
with integrated sustainable rural development which was launched,  in  fact,
in this House by the Minister some two years ago, and forms the  cornerstone
of the structure of the rural development nodes announced by  the  President
last year.

Co-operatives, have also been established, and this has  been  raised,  also
in terms of what the Minister had spoken about on more than one occasion  in
this House. In fact, Taung, which is a very  rural  and  poor  area  in  the
North West province, had an irrigation scheme  that  had  really  collapsed,
but as a result of these initiatives 85% of it is now  back  in  production,
and in fact, in effective production. Members will recollect  that  when  we
visited the North West province, this was conveyed to  us  by  the  MEC  for
agriculture.

In terms of black economic empowerment, members of  the  delegation  of  the
North West  will  recall  that  when  we  visited  Galagadi  we  were  quite
impressed by the enormous strides that have been taken in terms  of  farming
with goats. We learnt about the Afrikaner goat  there.  But  what  was  more
interesting was ... [Interjections.]
An HON MEMBER: Die boerbok! [The Boer goat!]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE  COUNCIL:  Die  boerbok,  nie  die  Afrikaner?  Ek  is
jammer. Adjunkminister, ek is baie jammer,  die  ou  Afrikaner  was  tog  'n
boer, né? [The Boer goat, not the Afrikaner? I am sorry. Deputy Minister,  I
am sorry, but the old Afrikaner was a farmer, not so?]

In any event, what  was  very  impressive  about  this,  was  that  all  the
farmers, in terms of farming with goats, were  women.  Not  only  were  they
successful in what they were undertaking, but  they  were  very  excited  by
this enterprise.  Whilst  there  were  rumours  and  allegations  that  this
process  has  not  taken  off,  we  have,  in  fact,  seen  the   successful
implementation of this progress.

There's also been particular  attention  paid  to  ensuring  that  there  is
sustainable development. We have discovered in the province  that  there  is
degradation of land, and the Minister has referred to  land  care  projects,
and we can say that 31 land cases have been identified and  there  has  been
an enhancement  of  beet  production  within  the  province,  which  largely
contributes to the economic  growth  and  the  agricultural  growth  of  the
province. These initiatives have resulted in 2300 jobs.

In terms of the integrated sustainable  rural  development  initiatives,  we
can announce with a great deal of pride that there are now  38  participants
in the Kudumane and Ganyesa areas in the North West province.

The hon Minister has also alluded to a very important aspect, because as  we
are engaged in pushing back  the  frontiers  of  poverty,  we  have  to  pay
particular attention to food and food security and the nutritional needs  of
our people.  The  province  has  embarked  on  a  provincial  food  mountain
project. Pardon my Setswana:  Letsema  la  mantshatlala.  [Through  communal
effort we fight hunger.] That is the project that has been initiated in  the
province. Fifty three villages have been targeted in 11 municipalities,  and
it will convert into food relief for hundreds of  our  people;  hundreds  of
households, in fact.
The province has also recognised that one cannot determine a strategy  in  a
vacuum.  One  has  to  be  mindful  of  the  initiatives  of  the   national
Government, and also of the particular responsibility of  local  government.
To  this  end,  we  have  liaised  with  the  North  West  Local  Government
Association and the municipalities to ensure that when we develop plans  for
food  security  and  initiatives  for  capacity-building,  we   do   so   in
consultation with local government, because that is where the  people  live,
that is where initiatives should be undertaken in  developing  emerging  and
micro farmers and developing the appropriate skills, and ensuring that  food
security is achieved.

The province also believes that the youth, disabled people, and  women  have
to receive special attention.  To  this  end,  various  projects  have  been
developed and are going to be initiated to ensure that they  form  part  and
parcel of the initiatives undertaken by the  North  West  province.  Another
concern that has arisen in the context of the North  West  province  is  the
fact that we have a fast-growing city  like  Rustenburg  -  because  of  its
mining resources - which impacts negatively on farming  and  food  security.
Particular initiatives have been taken in this regard.

As I round up, Chairperson, because of the limited time that I have,  may  I
commend  the  hon  Minister  and  the  Land  Claims  Commissioner,  and  the
commissioners that assist them, by saying, firstly, that the appointment  of
commissioners in the  various  provinces,  excluding  mine  -  and  I  don't
begrudge you for that - has been very successful. There isn't one  in  North
West, because we're sharing one with Gauteng. But I could  share  with  you,
hon Minister, an experience: Through  the  hon  chairperson  of  the  select
committee, we were able to facilitate a meeting  with  Mr  Blessing  Mphela,
whom I would like to commend - he was a blessing to the Mojanala district  -
to enquire about the progress of land. I can say quite proudly  as  I  stand
here, that the process of prioritisation has  taken  place;  the  validation
and verification is now taking place. There is a great  deal  of  excitement
and jubilation in the communities to say that there is a positive  response.
I think, for the past two years, you, hon Minister, the Deputy Minister  and
your partners in the office  of  the  Land  Claims  Commissioner  should  be
commended for this particular initiative.

And as I close up, I have to mention a very important development  that  has
to be paid attention to. We have proposed communal land. I  think  it  would
release vast tracks of land to our people, and it  is  something  that  this
Council will take very, very seriously  as  it  embarks  on  its  provincial
week. I take this opportunity of thanking you as chairperson,  Rev  Moatshe.
I do not belong to this select committee, but  perhaps  I  should  pay  more
attention to the select committee in future.

[Mr H H  M  OELRICH  (Free  State):  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs in South Africa, Deputy  Minister,  colleagues,
delegates from other provinces, hon Ministers present  in  this  House,  hon
members of this House, I would like to thank you.

This is a year of combating poverty in  South  Africa.  [Interjections.]  We
were told at the beginning of this year that  we  should  find  ways,  as  a
Government, to either eradicate  poverty  or  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty.

As the Department of Agriculture in the Free State, we  worked  together  to
find ways of pushing back the frontiers of poverty in South Africa.]

It is in recognition of the plight of the poor and of  the  poverty  amongst
our  communities  that  the  Free  State  department  of   agriculture   has
identified four  areas  of  critical  importance  in  order  to  revive  and
restructure the rural economy of the Free State,  over  the  medium  to  the
long term.

Prioritising these objectives meant that the focus  had  to  be  aligned  to
these areas: Firstly, agricultural, technical support and training  to  land
redistribution projects; secondly, ensuring household food security for  the
poor in the province; thirdly, technical support to the development of agri-
businesses in the province, and, fourthly, ensuring that commonage  land  is
better untilised for the intensification of agricultural production.
Coming to land redistribution for agricultural development,  the  department
supports and guides the design of LRAD projects at  district  level.  Strong
institutional ties exist between  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  the
provincial office of the Department of Land Affairs at  all  levels  in  the
province.

Successful  models  exist,  where  projects  with  the  necessary  technical
support, training and aftercare have managed to create new jobs as  well  as
sustainable livelihoods for farm families.  Since  the  LRAD  programme  was
launched in August 2001, until March 2003, the Free State has  approved  312
projects benefiting 2047 of our  people  with  a  grant  of  R76,4  million.
Landbank loans contributed to the value of R13,2 million.

Let me congratulate Minister Thoko Didiza  for  having  the  foresight  that
LRAD would produce. Ours is a Government that is determined to  produce.  Of
these approved projects, 50% of farmers received their  title  deeds  within
six months after approval date. This timeframe  has,  with  new  initiaives,
been shortened to four months.

The impact of the programme is evident  in  these  successful  projects  and
many more. I'm going to quote two or three. In the Seketekete  project,  six
members, previously unemployed, bought a 199 ha of farm  near  Lindley.  The
farm was 100% funded through the  LRAD  grant.  These  farmers  grow  maize,
sunflowers, wheat, cattle and sheep  on  a  commercial  basis.  Their  first
harvest of wheat in November 2002 was a great success, to  the  extent  that
they bought another 15 ha of land with the income, as well as an  additional
26 head of cattle.

The project shows all the  attributes  of  sustainability  and  the  natural
resources have been improved through the implementation of  good  management
practices.

About the Monateng project, in addition to extensive  support  and  training
provided by the Department of Agriculture, valuable  mentorship  support  is
also given by the  neighbouring  commercial  farmer  Mr  Koot  Pienaar,  who
assists them with practical farming and marketing  of  their  produce.  This
project has been making a net profit for the past two years.

About the  Thakamahoa  Farmers  project,  the  five  beneficiaries  of  this
project bought a 214 ha farm near Ventersburg by making use of LRAD  grants.
The farm was transferred to them early in 2002. They run a successful  dairy
and pig farm on land which was out of production  for  over  a  year.  Their
profit from milk sales is in the order of R2 000 per  month,  and  from  the
sale of pigs, an average of R2 500 per month.

These examples continue to reveal that, with the necessary support from  all
stakeholders, emerging farmers have the drive and the ability to  make  land
redistribution, and the LRAD programme in particular, a success story.

About the empowerment and support to newly established  farmers,  a  further
R1 million was spent on farmer training at the Glen College of  Agriculture,
over and above the normal extension and technical support. A  total  of  835
farmers benefited from this directly. These are all emerging farmers.

About youth development, the department regards youth in agriculture  as  an
important aspect, and has vistited 208 schools and formed  108  youth  clubs
in rural areas, over the 2002-03  financial  year.  At  this  stage,  3  800
learners are involved in this programme. A total  of  49  training  sessions
were also presented  to  youth  clubs.  A  number  of  bursaries  were  also
awarded, both to part-time and full-time students.

About disaster management, emerging farmers who lost most of  their  grazing
as a result of veld fires, were assisted with 800 round bales  from  various
Government departments and commercial farmers. The number of livestock  that
received fodder was 5 098 cattle, 1 974 sheep, 94 horses, 113 goats  and  12
donkeys.

To date, R333  108  has  been  received  from  the  national  Department  of
Agriculture to support farmers who lost animals in the fire  disaster  areas
of the Northern Free State. The funds will be distributed during  the  month
of April.

About farmer to farmer exchange, two groups, namely the Ditlhake  Irrigation
and the Oppermansgronde study groups, were formed and are functioning  well.
Additional study groups were  formed  in  Bothaville  and  Kroonstad.  Study
groups serve as platforms on which farmers exchange ideas and  practices  on
how  to  improve  their  farming  businesses.   Financial   and   diagnostic
information is analysed. It is anticipated that more study  groups  will  be
established among our emergent farmers in the 2003-04 financial year.

About  food  security  and  nutritional  programmes,   the   Department   of
Agriculture, together with the Departments  of  Social  Development,  Health
and Education, participates in the Integrated Food  Security  and  Nutrition
Programme at provincial level.
A food security  forum  exists  in  the  province  with  participation  from
different Government departments, community-based organisations and NGOs  to
ensure that the former school feeding scheme changes and becomes more  of  a
community initiative. The Department of  Agriculture  also  participates  in
these initiatives at local level.

The Department of Agriculture in the Free State has introduced the  standard
food security starter packs to the value of R4 500 per  household,  for  the
needy groups, which includes  gardening  tools,  winter  and  summer  seeds,
manure, fertiliser, water hoses, 20 one-month-old  chickens,  feed  for  the
chickens and a small poultry house.

Two hundred and two households were also trained  in  food  security  coping
strategies. I must say this programme only started in late December  of  the
previous year.

In  concurrence  with  the  objectives  of  the  IFSNP,  the  Department  of
Agriculture has adopted the concept of feeding minds  and  fighting  hunger,
which is a programme that exposes children from  primary,  intermediary  and
secondary schools to food security.

About  the  Community  Project  Fund  Support   Programme,   this   European
Commission-funded initiative managed by our department has supported  6  131
individuals, which is 2 647 beneficiaries and 3 484 dependants, by  the  end
of March 2003, to the total grant of R18,3 million.

About commonage development, the  department's  main  aim  is,  firstly,  to
formalise  relationships  between  commonage   users   and   municipalities,
secondly, to maximise access to commmonage land for people  from  previously
disadvantaged  communities   and,   thirdly,   to   intensify   agricultural
production on commonages.

To  give  effect  to  this  objective,   the   department   has   contracted
intermediary organisations which are currently working on commonages in  the
Lejweleputswa district. A similar project  is  about  to  kick  off  in  the
Xhariep district.

In intensifying agricultural  production,  agroprocessing  and  value-adding
processes will be strongly considered, given the high unemployment  rate  in
and around rural Free State towns.

About agroprocessing and diversification, the department has embarked  on  a
definite and asserted drive to encourage  farmers  to  add  value  to  their
primary produce. The two main  agricultural  industries,  namely  grain  and
livestock production, is targeted.

When considering that the Free State produces close to 40% of the  grain  in
South Africa, 23% of the wool and 21% of the red meat, the fact that  we  at
this stage have the second highest unemployment rate,  just  does  not  make
sense. It's time that  we  created  jobs  for  our  people.  [Time  expired]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL (Mr M J Mahlangu): Re go kwele  samma;
o boletse gabotse. E ke ka moka re ka leka bjalo gobane ke nako ya  gore  re
ithute maleme ka moka. [Deputy Chairperson, we have heard you, Comrade.  You
have spoken very well. I wish we could all do  that,  because  it  is  about
time that we learn other languages.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, die agb Oelrich het  my  nou  baie  jaloers
gemaak met die mooi Sotho wat  hy  praat,  want  ál  Sotho  wat  ek  uit  my
kinderdae kan onthou, is dié van die swart vrou wat my grootgemaak het,  wat
altyd net vir my gesê het: ``Suka, tsamaya!'' [Skoert! Weg is jy!]  [Gelag.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the hon Oelrich  has  just  made  me  very
jealous by speaking Sotho so beautifully,  because  the  only  Sotho  I  can
remember from my childhood days is  that  spoken  by  the  black  woman  who
brought me up, who always said to me: ``Suka, tsamaya!'' [Scram!  Go  away!]
[Laughter.]]

But Chairperson, if South Africa wants to succeed with land reform, we  need
to succeed with agriculture as a whole. Natural disasters cause  agriculture
in South Africa to be a high-risk sector. And except for the  subsidies  our
global competitors receive  from  their  governments,  which  put  us  in  a
negative position, we also have local  factors  that  impact  negatively  on
this industry.

These are the proposed land  tax  -  the  confusion  in  application  causes
negativity - and maybe the hon Minister can give us some  clarity  on  this;
the increased road tax; toll roads; increased diesel  prices;  the  decrease
in the real contribution to agricultural research;  the  uncertainty  caused
by the Modderklip court case, and the section 28 certificates that  transfer
national property to provinces are moving so slowly.  An  amendment  to  the
Extension of Security of Tenure Act that has been in the  pipeline  for  two
years is needed now to solve the problems in this regard.

The Strategic Plan for Agriculture - and we applaud the plan  -  places  the
proposed Agriculture Risk Insurance Bill on the backburner until  2004,  and
risk management is so important in this industry. The Bill  provides,  inter
alia, for a system  of  agricultural  insurance  in  order  to  improve  the
economic stability of agriculture and enhance the income  of  those  farmers
and producers most vulnerable to losses. We should not wait  too  long  with
this.

The Chief Whip also referred to this  -  and  I  am  not  referring  to  the
``Afrikanerbokke''   [``Afrikaner   bucks''].   According   to   the    2003
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review personnel budgets absorb a very  high  share
of the budgets in the provinces, especially those that inherited  homelands.
Many of the personnel are not the  skilled  personnel  required  to  provide
support services to farmers, and that is exactly what we  need!  Many  other
legacies of the past were successfully addressed in the last nine  years  in
South Africa and maybe the MECs should tell us why we are not succeeding  in
this respect.

Land reform must succeed, and we have been saying that for  the  ninth  time
now. But the goal of 30%  of  agricultural  land  going  to  the  previously
disadvantaged communities,  within  the  next  so  many  years,  needs  more
thought. I want to suggest that we push the percentage up, but that we  make
it a percentage, not  of  the  area  of  land,  but  of  the  production  in
agriculture. This approach will  result  in  sustainable  practices  and  in
successful people on agricultural land. Land reform should  be  measured  by
how many people were made part of the output, the profits  and  the  success
of agriculture. I urge the hon Minister to rethink the formula.

Chairperson, the hon Moatshe and I are comrades in religion,  but  now  also
comrades in the belief we have in aquaculture and I will carry on where  you
stopped him earlier.  Aquaculture  was  moved  from  Sea  Fisheries  to  the
Department of Agriculture about five or six years ago. And this is a  sector
with untapped possibilites for South Africa and Africa as a whole, a  sector
where South Africa can take the lead.

Aquaculture refers to the  controlled  production  of  aquatic  species  for
human consumption and industrial  use.  Currently,  aquaculture  contributes
27% to world fisheries. Aquaculture has realised a  cumulative  growth  rate
of - and listen to this - 14,5% over the period 1992 to  2000,  compared  to
the 3,5% for animal production and the 1,8% for fisheries.

In spite of its vast natural  and  human  resources,  the  participation  of
Africa in this growing global  food  and  trade  sector  is  disconcertingly
lacking.  The  African  continent  contributes  only  1,2%  to  the   global
aquaculture production and South Africa contributes only 1% of the  1,2%  in
Africa. This lack of participation from  the  African  continent  is  mainly
attributable to socio-economic and socio-political factors, and that can  be
changed overnight.

I would have preferred to deliver the rest of the next  input  in  Zulu,  so
that the Minister can really grab and understand what I want to say,  but  I
will do it in the language that I  know  best  and  that  is  Afrikaans,  so
please use your earpiece. [Interjections.]

Die beplanning vir akwakultuurprojekte, kommersieel en in vennootskappe,  is
reeds ver  gevorder  in  provinsies  soos  die  Wes-Kaap,  KwaZulu-Natal  en
Mpumalanga. Twee groot projekte word beplan by Kosibaai en op en  langs  die
Pongola-dam. Die projek op die Makhatini-vlakte  word,  in  samewerking  met
die  gemeenskap,  die   privaatsektor   en   nasionale   en   internasionale
universiteite onderneem. Hierdie projekte gaan  werk  verskaf  aan  ongeveer
700  mense,  en  1  000  mense  gaan  direk  voordeel  trek  uit  dividende.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The planning for acqua-culture projects, commercially and in  partnerships,
has made considerable progress  in  provinces  such  as  the  Western  Cape,
KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Two large projects are being planned  at  Kosi
Bay and on and along the Pongola Dam. The project on the Makhatini Flats  is
being undertaken in co-operation with the community, the private sector  and
local and international universities. And this project is going  to  provide
work to approximately 700 people, and 1 000 people are going to profit  from
dividends.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Your  speaking  time
has expired, hon member.

Mr A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  you  are  discriminating  against  the
reverend and me, but we accept it. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Ms K C MASHEGO-DLAMINI (Mpumalanga): Thank you, Chairperson.  I  would  like
to take this moment to extend a word of condolence to  this  House  and  the
family of Ntlabati for the passing away of  Comrade  Senorita,  and  also  a
word of thanks for this golden opportunity to partake in this debate on  the
Budget Vote on Agriculture and Land Affairs. I feel moved by the content  of
the Budget Vote, especially when it touches the wonderful stories about  how
people, individually and collectively, have responded to the  call  to  work
together for a better life for all.

Over the weekend and the past three days, I was  reviewing  the  content  of
the Minister's speech, so as to be more objective in this debate.  The  idea
of supporting people who have acquired land to become commercial farmers  is
indeed the way to practicalise the call by our President that  this  is  the
year of unity to push back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  The  only  way  of
pushing back the frontiers of poverty is not to allow farmers to  remain  in
the subsistence mode, but for them to develop the  confidence  to  face  the
domestic and international markets with good quality products.

The level of improved  Government  support  to  farmers  in  Mpumalanga  has
already started on a training programme. It is also  supporting  an  NGO-led
and donor-funded mentorship pilot project which aims at  sharing  experience
and expertise.

Mpumalanga has also started to  implement  public-private  partnerships.  An
agreement with SASEX was concluded to implement a  joint  extension  venture
for small-scale sugarcane growers. We also have an agreement with Cotton  SA
on  the  training  of  emergent  cotton  farmers.  Eighty-two  farmers  have
received their certificates of competence.  Twenty-four  wool  farmers  were
funded by the National Wool Growers' Association. Mpumalanga also  completed
a rural household survey in different pilot areas in the  province  as  part
of its rural development programme and  this  will  serve  as  basis  and  a
learning experience for a participatory approach by our extension officers.

We are now actively involved  in  a  food  security  programme  particularly
addressing household food security in poor communities. Many women are safe-
trained, not only to produce food, but also  to  prepare  nutritious  dishes
and to preserve  food  in  different  ways.  The  food  parcel  distribution
programme is also running well in our province.

The  Sanganer  Breeders'  Association  introduced  their  programme  in  co-
operation with our department to provide breeding stock to selected  farmers
as part of a livestock improvement scheme.

As a province bordering two countries, we are also playing  a  role  in  the
SADC region. The province has a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  Maputo
province in Mozambique, and a technical committee for agriculture  has  been
formed. This committee has identified areas of co-operation between the  two
provinces. Food security is at the top of the agenda there.

The foot-and-mouth outbreak in Mozambique is still contained in  Mozambique.
Mpumalanga  is  still  maintaining  its  foot-and-mouth-free  status  as   a
province. We just want to reassure this House that we will keep  the  status
for ever.

I would like to commend the Minister for the restructuring of the ARC.  Most
of the ARC restructuring  has  started  to  bear  some  good  fruit  in  our
province.  We  have  recently  attended  their   horticulture   imbizo   and
participated for three days.

In our efforts to develop the skills of our people and to realise the  human
development strategy of Government  so  that  it  meets  the  needs  of  our
province,  the  department  has  introduced  a  bursary  scheme   to   train
veterinarians. As I am speaking here five students funded by us are  at  the
University of Pretoria.

When the Minister raised the challenge of putting into practice the  sharing
of experience and expertise between black and white farmers,  the  words  of
one of the greatest scholars, Olive Schreiner, became clear:


  The ultimate chant of the human race on earth is not to be  conceived  of
  as a monotone, chanted on one note by one form  of  humanity  alone.  But
  rather as a choral symphony chanted by all races and all nations  in  one
  grand complex harmony.

I just want to challenge this House, all of us here, to turn our  thumbs  up
and we must do so in order to honour the good work which  is  done  by  this
department and the Minister who is leading this department.

Yikho ngisho ngithi malibongwe igama lamakhosikazi malibongwe! [That is  why
I am saying the women's name should be praised! It must be praised!]
HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe!

Ms K C MASHEGO-DLAMINI (Mpumalanga): Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, the ACDP is in  support  of  the  Department  of
Land Affairs in its endeavours to find  fair  and  reasonable  solutions  to
issues surrounding spatial ownership and development, and  of  the  way  the
Minister has approached the subject. We also congratulate the  Minister  and
her department on the achievement of transferring 295  024  ha  to  140  227
beneficiaries in the past year alone. It is a great achievement. We  in  the
Western Cape are also  pleased  to  see  that  the  growth  in  agricultural
spending has increased to about 14,3% against the 9,3% national average.

However, problems, Minister, do remain. Not the least is the new  land  tax.
According to the Cane Growers' Association, the  value  of  the  land  could
fall by 20% for every 1% property tax levied. According to them -


  One of our main concerns is that  rates  will  undermine  the  collateral
  value of land ...

Which is what happened in Zimbabwe -


  ... increasing the debt to asset value of farmers and thus their  ability
  to repay loans.

Less capital value, Minister, you know, equates to  less  potential  working
capital. We all support the transformation process, but  we  must  see  that
the transformation process underpins land values  and  not  that  it  erodes
land values.

You know, Minister, 30% of farms are for sale in South Africa today  anyway.
So acquisition of land is not difficult.  Everywhere  there  are  farms  for
sale.

The cane growers' findings  were  confirmed  by  a  survey  of  a  range  of
agricultural commodities such as timber, beef and sugar, undertaken  by  the
University of Natal. And tribal land is also affected by this process.
The new tax is going to influence  land  use  decisions  and  can  radically
affect the status of  most  remaining  natural  veld,  which  is  mostly  in
private hands, and could have a disastrous impact  on  biodiversity  and  on
private conservation efforts. By far the greatest  percentage  of  our  rich
plant and animal biodiversity is in private  hands,  mostly  held,  not  for
profit, but because of a deeply held conservation ethic which exists.

The land tax will also penalise those that have  safeguarded  and  protected
their land and cleared it of alien vegetation, whilst benefiting those  that
have allowed their land to become degraded and infested by alien plants.

The impact of the land  tax  upon  biodiversity  and  upon  rural  economies
should therefore not be underestimated,  according  to  Dr  Mark  Botha,  an
authority with the Botanical Society.

The Minister should use every effort with the tax authorities  to  gain  tax
relief from the profit in taxes for landowners that have  invested  millions
in protecting our natural heritage, with  major  spin-off  benefits  to  our
country in terms of rural and ecotourism, particularly while, in return  for
the land tax, no services are provided to  these  farmers  or  benefits  are
received by these landowners. There must be delivery  involved  if  you  are
paying tax.

These could be properties in designated  and  specified  conservation  areas
like biosphere reserves or could be  properties  that  have  a  conservation
status, such as those designated private nature reserves and  conservancies.
If not, conservation can suffer in South Africa.

When we look at farming - of course I know the Minister  is  not  guilty  of
this, because she makes  very  good  speeches  -  we  must  not  see  it  in
isolation. We need to understand that farming is  only  one  activity  in  a
virtuous circle with many  spin-off  benefits  upstream  and  downstream  of
primary agriculture, for example the village-based rural  economy  with  its
agricultural service industries and suppliers; bulk storage, buildings,  the
chemical  and  fertiliser  industry,  financial   services,   vehicles   and
implements, and repairs. There is  also  the  whole  agri-industrial  sector
which  is  reliant  on   agriculture   with   its   processing,   packaging,
distribution, marketing, transport by land, sea and air, and storage and  so
on. In short a major employer. [Time expired.]

... and ladies and gentlemen ... [Laughter.] ...  a  key  objective  of  the
Northern Cape department of agriculture and land reform  is  to  unlock  the
agricultural potential of  the  province  to  promote  economic  growth  and
social development. The  province  has  a  vision  of  contributing  towards
Africa's economic recovery plan,  Nepad,  through  its  agricultural  sector
that has to date achieved  commendable  success  in  changing  thousands  of
lives for the better, empowering many of our poor communities. High  on  the
list of priorities  is  the  acceleration  of  the  province's  land  reform
programme to ensure equitable access to land by  new  emerging  farmers  and
the rendering  of  effective  support  services  to  enable  these  emerging
farmers and  communities  to  become  self-  sufficient  in  terms  of  food
security.

As part of its black economic empowerment strategy, our  department  managed
to distribute more than 14 000 ha of identified agricultural state  land  to
previously disadvantaged individuals during the previous financial year.  In
the Siyanda region 17 ha of land at the Eiland  research  station  had  been
allocated to two emerging farmers, while 3 121 ha of grazing land at  Carter
Blok had gone to two other  emerging  farmers.  In  the  Kgalagadi  District
8,700 ha of grazing land of the Boland farms have been  leased  to  emerging
farmers in the district, while  in  the  Francis  Baard  area  three  female
farmers have benefited from the allocation of 60 ha of land.

It is surprising to know that the Griqualand West Co-operative Ltd  will  on
this coming Tuesday allocate shares to these three women who are  interested
in agriculture, and I think we need to commend them ...  [Applause]  ...  To
crown it all this is an Afrikaner agribusiness that is taking our people  on
board  as  well  and  we  want  to  congratulate  them  on  these   efforts.
Collectively, the allocation of  cultivated  land  and  grazing  state  land
constitutes about 50% of all identified agricultural  state  land.  Although
this is still far from our target of 30 000 ha, it proves that the  province
is serious about making land available and economically empowering  emerging
farmers as well as women.

In a further drive to broaden access  to  agriculture  in  the  province  by
previously disadvantaged individuals,  the  Goodhouse  Paprika  Project  has
been established. A total of 55 benefited from  this  project.  In  addition
the construction of a processing plant for spice and oil  from  paprika  has
been completed. Twenty hectares of paprika has already been planted  and  we
envisage the planting of more hactares, creating more opportunities for  our
emerging farmers. A rooibos tea project in  the  Suid-Bokkeveld  is  another
initiative  that  presents  exciting  opportunities   for   black   economic
empowerment.  Five  emerging  farmers  are  currently  benefiting  from  the
processing and packaging of the rooibos tea for the export market.

During this financial year our department  will  continue  with  its  Orange
River Farm Settlement Programme which aims to broaden access to  agriculture
by  previously  disadvantaged  individuals  and  communities.   Under   this
programme, the following projects will be implemented.

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, with all due respect, I just wanted to  know  if
the hon member can just take one small question. That will be very  helpful,
then I can be more attentive. A simple one!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Are you prepared to take a question?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: I am prepared to take a question when I  am  finished  with
my speech, Deputy Chairperson.

Rev M CHABAKU: I did not understand. What is the response?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: He is  prepared  to  take  a  question
when he is finished with his speech.

Rev M CHABAKU: I will not be able to focus! It is just a small thing, man.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, 282 ha of  Congregational  Church  land  were
identified and in the Pella area 745 ha were identified as well  as  450  ha
in the Sanddrift area. The  department  also  has  a  livestock  improvement
programme for beneficiaries of  land  reform.  It  is  envisaged  that  this
programme will eventually be linked to  the  presidential  bull  and  heifer
project. The department's aim is also to have  two  emerging  stud  farmers.
The province is aware that it is not  enough  to  merely  allocate  land  to
previously disadvantaged communities to become farmers. It  has  to  provide
ongoing support to these communities to use their new land productively.

To this end, the department has developed a comprehensive strategy in  terms
of which regular training is offered to our emerging farmers  through  study
groups and farmers' days etc.

The province is also in the process of developing  training  manuals  and  a
training programme that will be implemented  at  the  research  stations  at
Vaalharts and at the Eiland. In  addition  the  emerging  farmers  are  also
given an opportunity to  undergo  training  on  the  management  of  animals
before  they  are  offered  breeding  material  at  a   subsidised   tariff.
Holographic Property CC in Upington is an excellent example of the  kind  of
support that is provided for the emerging farmers in our province.
Three farm workers with more than 60 years  of  farming  experience  between
them decided that it was about time for them to own  their  own  farm  after
years of being farm  labourers.  With  the  help  of  the  Land  Bank,  they
purchased a farm from their employer. Through negotiations between the  Land
Bank and the  former  employer  the  new  farmers  are  being  mentored  and
trained. The Upington branch of the Land Bank  and  the  Department  of  the
Land Affairs have been providing them with the  necessary  support,  support
guidance and information to ensure that they are sustainable and can  become
successful farmers. The branch also visits them on a weekly basis to  assist
them with marketing options as well as best farming practices.

Their operation is so successful that they have been able to  hire  some  of
their former colleagues as their workers and this has  also  improved  their
lives. This project has not only given them the  opportunity  to  own  land,
but also to create jobs in the area and to alleviate poverty.

Another significant development has been the launch  of  the  food  security
programme in April last year targeting  women,  youth,  unemployed  and  the
disabled. In terms of this programme,  starter  packs  including  seeds  and
garden tools to the value of  R47  282  were  donated  to  give  people  the
opportunity to establish  their  own  food  gardens  in  the  Francis  Baard
region, Siyanda region as well as in the Karoo  region.  All  together  more
than  16  000  household  members  have  benefited  from   this   particular
programme.

As part of its food security  strategy,  the  province  is  promoting  stock
farming in terms of which  farmers  are  provided  with  an  opportunity  to
purchase  breeding  animals  from  the  various  research  stations  in  the
province. Closely linked to this is the  implementation  of  various  animal
disease control measures in order  to  protect  the  animal  population  and
secure  livelihoods.  The  province  will  also,   through   vet   services,
facilitate the establishment of food safety control committees at  each  and
every local municipality. The purpose of these committees is to protect  and
educate  consumers  on  food  safety  aspects.  These  initiatives  will  be
strengthened through  an  extensive  food  safety  campaign  which  will  be
implemented in the province from May until October this year.

In conclusion, through  our  agricultural  development  initiatives  we  are
slowly transforming our barren land into productive assets. While  doing  so
we are mindful of the enormous challenges that  still  lie  ahead.  Some  of
these  challenges  include  increasing  the  participation   of   women   in
commercial agriculture, increasing the provision of support services to  the
emerging farmer community and  increasing  entrepreneurial  skills  training
for emerging farmers. Given the  level  of  inequality  we  have  inherited,
these challenges will not be easy to overcome. However, they  remain  firmly
in our focus as we plan for the years ahead. The  success  in  dealing  with
these challenges will to a large extent be determined by  how  effective  we
are in raising public awareness opportunities  in  the  agricultural  sector
and creating partnerships  with  all  those  involved  in  the  agricultural
sector. Thank you, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]
Nkk J N VILAKAZI:  Mphathisihlalo  ohloniphekileyo,  mhlonishwa  Ngqongqoshe
womnyango nabasizi bakho,  abafowethu  nodadewethu  emKhandlwini  kaZwelonke

enilukhombisayo ningashintshi. Egameni leqembu lami  i-IFP  ngithi  phambili
nomsebenzi womnyango wakho Ngqongqoshe  phambili!  (Translation  of  isiZulu
paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister of the department and  your
assistants, brothers and sisters in the National Council  of  Provinces,  it
is a pleasure for me to voice my opinion  on  today's  debate,  which  deals
with agriculture and land. If we look at the budget of the hon Minister  and
her  department  today,  we  realise  that  she  is   faced   with   a   big
responsibility  involving  the  country,  land  and  agriculture.   We   can
visualise her going up and down, engaged  in  land  restitution  activities.
This land was confiscated by the apartheid government from people who  lived
comfortably in their own homes with their families,  unsuspecting  that  one
day things would turn out to be like this.

The hon Minister  and  her  department  need  more  money  to  sustain  this
undertaking. We acknowledge and commend  her  work  because  even  in  cases
where people can no longer recover the land of their forefathers,  they  are
allocated alternative land that will appease them. I wish that  your  budget
allocation for this undertaking could be increased, hon Minister, to  enable
you to accomplish this task so that no one complains about  land  any  more.
There are no jobs; the soil yields profit to people who use  it.  There  are
farmers, especially in the rural areas, who have the skills to make  use  of
the soil, but they are disadvantaged by financial problems. Each  and  every
province has a responsibility to identify these  emerging  farmers.  Whether
they are small-scale or large-scale, they  need  financial  assistance  from
the Minister's department.

There are also people who have land for farming, but lack the  expertise  to
farm profitably. There is a need for permanent support, especially in  rural
areas. In the past there used to be agricultural  advisers  who  resided  in
the community and taught the people farming skills. This kind of support  is
essential for the development of the  community,  so  that  the  people  can
acquire different types of skills in using the soil. The soil must  be  able
to produce crops so that the farmers and  their  families  can  consume  the
produce and also sell it at a profit. The main budget provides for  salaries
and wages for the workers and this means that  the  employees  must  receive
training. I was happy to learn from the  Minister's  speech  that  there  is
money that has been set aside specifically for this purpose. Employees  need
to be trained in order to acquire different types  of  skills  so  that  the
standard of agriculture can be improved in the department.

In the provinces we need the capacity to scrutinise and detect  quickly  the
activities taking place in the Public Service so that we can put an  end  to
the abuse of funds. We are  grateful  to  the  President  for  his  role  in
developing certain rural areas with a view to improving the economy.

Hon Minister, we request that funds for this  operation  be  made  available
quickly because some  of  these  places  that  have  been  targeted  by  the
President have not received the  money  to  perform  those  tasks.  KwaZulu-
Natal,  for  instance,  is  one  of  the  places  where  we  received   such
complaints. On behalf of the IFP, I support the budget as  presented,  which
is before us.  To  the  hon  Minister,  let  me  say  that  we  applaud  the
allocation of R5,3 million as provision for bursaries  that  are  needed  in
this department. This will be a challenge to  our  children  to  take  their
studies seriously so that they can get this bursary.

Hon Minister, let me  say  without  any  reservation  that  your  department
displays a very special, commendable skill. We praised them very  much  when
they were here to present the department's programme. Keep up the good  work
and do not change. On behalf of my party, the IFP, I say: Forward with  your
department's work, hon Minister!]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I just  want  to  make  members  aware
that our system is not functioning properly here, so members should  not  be
disturbed when the light comes on whilst members are  still  on  the  floor.
There is something faulty here but we will deal with it.

Dr P A MOTSOWALEDI (Northern Province): Hon Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon
Deputy Minister, fellow  MECs  from  the  Free  State  and  Mpumalanga,  and
representatives from other provinces, let me  start  by  congratulating  the
Minister for her successful budget speech  she  delivered  in  the  National
Assembly last week and to this House earlier this afternoon.

Minister, I know it's not my duty to defend you because I  heard  you  doing
that very ably when  there  was  an  attack  on  the  Agricultural  Research
Council. I don't intend doing it today, because I know you are going  to  do
it very ably. But I just want to mention that what people  do  not  know  is
that in the past the research council did not recognise the fact that  there
were black people and black farmers in this country. When  we  make  changes
so that they can be recognised, some people  start  crying  foul.  It's  not
only the research council at the higher level.  We  do  have  other  smaller
research stations in our provinces. When you find out how they  are  helping
the people, you will find that  there  is  only  one  group  who  have  been
benefiting from research. And it is illegal in  this  country  for  that  to
continue. So, Minister don't be intimidated  by  anybody.  Please  carry  on
with the good work of restructuring in the research council.

Let me touch on the issues of the land because obviously there would  be  no
agriculture and no agricultural development without land. We are very  happy
about the accelerating  pace  of  land  restitution  in  Limpopo  since  the
Minister amended some of the regulations and also brought  on  a  very  able
commissioner in the name of Mr Mashile Mokono. Sometimes last year, you  and
the former Chief Land Claims Commissioner Dr  Wallace  Mgoqi  became  common
sights in successive weekends in the rural villages of Limpopo. We are  very
grateful for this because lots of land have been delivered to our people  in
Reboile, Makotopong, Kranspoort, Munghezi, Ximanga,  Mavhungeni,  Manavhela,
Pheeha, etc.

We reciprocated your actions, because towards the end  of  March  we  bought
these communities some tractors, barrows, ploughs, discs  and  planters.  In
some communities, where necessary, we  also  bought  them  spray  carts  and
herbicides. We spent a sum of R5 million in  this  process.  We  are  hoping
that  the  Minister,  together  with  the  new  Acting  Chief   Land   Claim
Commissioner Mr Thozi Gwanya, who honoured us  by  attending  this  sector's
presentation ceremony this year, will once again become the normal flora  of
Limpopo during weekends, coming to deliver land to our people. [Laughter.]

We have heard through grapevine - we could  not  confirm  this  -  that  the
Ministry is discussing  the  possibility  of  increasing  the  discretionary
funds given to land claimants. We from Limpopo will urge the  Minister  very
strongly that this be done as soon as possible. We urge for  that  increment
because we are scared that the majority of land that has  been  gazetted  in
Limpopo is very high-functioning commercial farms for which we  need  a  lot
of financial support, if they are not to collapse.
We wish to thank you for raising in your speech the  issue  of  partnerships
between emerging farmers.  We  believe  that  this  will  include  the  land
claimants, emerging farmers and  commercial  farmers.  We  in  Limpopo  have
already realised that this is the most effective way to go and  we  wish  to
follow it religiously, and of course with your guidance  and  help,  because
we believe there is  a  lot  of  commercially  viable  land  that  has  been
gazetted which will need to be run commercially.

On the issue of human resource development, we welcome the  announcement  of
the R3,5 million, if  I  am  not  mistaken,  of  bursaries  which  has  been
announced in this House for scarce skills. In  Limpopo  we  have  discovered
that we are the only province which is paying much more for  personnel  than
any other. I checked with my colleagues in Gauteng and here in  the  Western
Cape. I found that in the Gauteng  department  they  have  a  total  of  500
employees and in the Western Cape they have 650  employees.  In  Limpopo  we
have a total of 13 700 employees. When we took an audit, we found that  only
5% of them are at management level and only 8% are  skilled.  The  rest  are
the people who have been put there by the homeland governments  to  survive,
with no skills at all. For this reason, we have started on intensive  skills
campaign and decided deliberately  to  have  a  programme  as  part  of  our
strategic plan to send students to the  universities.  I  wish  to  announce
that we will be the first province  who  will  come  and  claim  that  money
because this year in January  we  have  already  sent  22  students  to  the
University of Natal  to  study  agriculture  and  engineering;  we  have  10
students  at  the  University  of  Pretoria  who  are  studying   veterinary
medicine; we have 6 students at the University of  Natal  who  are  studying
hydrology and we have 4 students who are studying Bsc in soil  science.  And
their families have just received land from you  in  the  land  restitution.
[Applause.] We thought it was in order for them to have skills to  come  and
utilise that land. Next year, we  are  intending  to  send  10  students  to
Rhodes University to study agricultural entomology, particularly from  those
families who are going to receive land which is already  functioning  farms.
Negotiations in this regard are far advanced. Next year,  we  will  send  10
students  to  the  University  of  Stellenbosch  to  study  viticulture  and
oenology because we want to transpose the grape and the wine  industry  from
the coast to inland. We will only do so if we have students who know.

On food security, we congratulate  you,  the  Minister  of  Health  and  the
Minister of Social Development on the very successful meeting we held on  28
March 2003 about food security, because there was  already  confusion  about
who should be in charge. We are happy that it has been made very clear  that
we  in  agriculture  are  in  charge  of  food  security  for  the   nation.
[Laughter.] We wish to state that this is a very,  very  serious  and  heavy
responsibility, but we will carry it out  with  distinction  in  support  of
this noble  task  of  providing  the  people  with  food.  We  have  already
discovered that a lot of  money  is  being  paid  by  Welfare,  Agriculture,
Public  Works,  Environmental  Affairs,  Water  Affairs   and   many   other
departments in trying to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty  through  the
poverty relief projects. But the biggest problem is that  people  have  been
using only common sense in running these projects. That is why many of  them
are not doing well. So, in this case we add skills.

What have we already started in Limpopo?  We  have  asked  our  agricultural
colleges to stop  taking  students  from  Matric,  but  to  implement  three
courses - a 6-week full-time course in poultry production, a  12-week  full-
time  course  in  vegetable  production  and  an  ongoing  course  in  maize
production, because we believe that if people in a rural  area  can  produce
their own poultry, vegetables and maize, they will not starve. To this  end,
these programmes are doing so well that the lists  of  people  who  want  to
attend them are unending. People are already booking their spaces. Even  the
private sector which has started projects  which  are  not  functioning  are
booking their spaces, and we are urging the Ministry to help us with  enough
money in this regard.

But more than anything, we urge the Minister in the House to  help  us  stop
the  Minister  of  Education  from  using   the   Constitution   to   annexe
agricultural  colleges  as  institutions  of   higher   education,   because
graduates will simply go to universities and teach  academic  education  and
not practical education, as  we  are  imparting  to  our  people  and  rural
farmers. This is not a fight with the Department of Education,  but  we  are
just fearful that the programmes we  have  already  started,  which  include
specifically poverty relief, land restitution and  land  redistribution  for
agricultural development are going to loose those colleges.

As far as irrigation schemes are concerned, the reason why in  our  province
R25 million has been put aside is the call by the  President  that  we  must
start  establishing  co-operatives,  and  we  hope  that  the   agricultural
irrigation schemes will work like that. We are urging. In the past years  we
have received money from the Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs  and
the Department of Water Affairs to finance  these  irrigation  schemes.  The
fact that this year our province has provided its own R25 million  does  not
mean that the Ministry should stop. We urge you to please  continue  helping
us. I thank you. [Applause.]
Mnr S E BYNEVELDT (Wes-Kaap): Mnr die Voorsitter, ons geskiedenis  in  Suid-
Afrika is 'n geskiedenis van veronregting, van swaarkry, van bakhand  staan,
van ``hotnot'' genoem word, en waarin ons ``kaffer'' as titel en naam  gekry
het. Ons geskiedenis is dié van uitsluiting en van diskriminasie.

Ongelykheid op grond van ras en geslag was destyds sterk  kenmerke  van  die
landbou. Die landbou is beslis nie onaangeraak deur ons erfenis nie. As  ons
kyk na grondbesit en na  die  toegang  tot  grond,  asook  na  die  destydse
posisie van kommersiële  boere,  wat  hoofsaaklik  wit  was,  en  die  groot
subsidies wat in ontvangs geneem is, kan ons agterkom  dat  ons  geskiedenis
inderdaad dié van veronregting is.

Dit is belangrik om ons by die geskiedenis aan te sluit, want  dan  verstaan
ons die toekoms en die pad vorentoe. Op  die  landbou  se  skouers  rus  die
swaar verantwoordelikheid van hierdie nalatenskap waarna ek verwys  het,  te
beredder van dit om te draai en terug te stuur. Wat ter sprake  is,  is  die
herverspreiding van welvaart, rykdom en geleenthede, met die klem  veral  op
geleenthede vir ons almal, en veral vir die mees  verontregtes.  Die  sukses
van Suid-Afrika en van Afrika is hier aan die  orde.  Die  landbou  moet  'n
lewendige werktuig wees vir die verwesenliking van hierdie  strewes  en  van
hierdie drang.

Dit alles gesê, moet ek sê ek kom ná die Minister  aan  die  woord,  met  'n
goeie gevoel in die hart en met baie vreugde.  Ek  het  na  u  geluister  en
verskeie stukke onder oë gehad. Ek weet die landbou, asook die  toekoms  van
die landbou, is in goeie hande. Ek wil u daarvoor bedank. Die manier  waarop
u die kritieke kwessies in u begrotingsrede insluit en die manier  waarop  u
dit in u uitgawevoornemens  inpas,  is  lewende  getuienis  daarvan.  Ek  is
dankbaar  vir  die  klem   wat   u   plaas   op   die   kapasiteitsbou   van
grondgebruikers, die oordra  van  kennis  en  inligting,  die  opvoeding  en
bemagtiging van ons mense en, uiteraard, op ons  almal  se  aanvaarding  van
verantwoordelikheid vir die omgewing.

Ons moet almal die visie van 'n verenigde landbou, wat voorspoed  vir  almal
saam verseker, teen die bors druk en doelbewus  bevorder.  Baie  dankie  vir
die manier waarop  u  dit  doen  en  'n  omgewing  skep  wat  bemagtig,  wat
geleenthede uitgebou sien en wat van ons verlede werk  maak.  Ons  moet  ons
vaardighede uitbou en in ons mense  belê.  Ons  moet  infrastruktuur  sinvol
vestig. Ons moet ongelykheid laat sneuwel en armoede terugstoot.  Volhoubare
plattelandse ontwikkeling op 'n geïntegreerde wyse moet verseker word.  Baie
dankie vir die manier waarop  u  vir  ons  die  pad  in  hierdie  onderskeie

[Mr S E BYNEVELDT (Western Cape): Mr Chairman, our history in  South  Africa
is a history of injustice, suffering, begging, being called  ``hotnot''  and
one in which we got the title and name of ``kaffir''. Our history is one  of
ostracism and discrimination.

In those days inequality on  the  basis  of  race  and  gender  were  strong
characteristics of agriculture. The agricultural sector was  definitely  not
free of our legacy. When we look at  ownership  of  land,  as  well  as  the
position then of commercial farmers at the time, who were mostly white,  and
the huge subsidies which were received, then we  realise  that  our  history
was indeed one of injustice.

It is important to link with history, because then we understand the  future
and the road ahead a little better. The burden to address this legacy,  turn
it  around  and  send  it  back,  rests  heavily  upon  the   shoulders   of
agriculture. What we are talking about is the redistribution of  prosperity,
wealth and opportunities, with the emphasis especially on opportunities  for
all of us and especially those who suffered the most injustice. The  success
of South Africa and Africa is at stake here.  Agriculture  should  become  a
living tool for the fulfilment of these aspirations and this urge.
After all this is said, I must add that I follow after the Minister  with  a
good feeling in my heart and much joy. I  have  listened  to  you  and  read
various documents. I know  that  agriculture,  as  well  as  the  future  of
agriculture, is in good hands. I wish to thank you  for  that.  The  way  in
which you included crucial issues in your budget  speech  and  the  way  you
fitted it into your planned expenditure are living testimony to this.  I  am
grateful for the capacity-building of land users, the transfer of  knowledge
and  information,  the  education  and  empowerment  of  our   people   and,
naturally, everybody's acceptance of responsibility for the environment.

We must all embrace the vision of a unified agricultural sector,  that  will
ensure prosperity for all, embrace it and  promote  it  purposefully.  Thank
you very much for the way in which you are doing this because it creates  an
environment that empowers, builds opportunities and addresses our  past.  We
must develop our  skills  and  invest  in  our  people.  We  must  establish
infrastructure sensibly. We must let inequality die and push  back  poverty.
Sustainable rural development in an integrated way must  be  ensured.  Thank
you very much for the way in which you point out the  road  ahead  in  these
various respects.]

The Western Cape is one of the most sophisticated  agricultural  regions  in
Africa and therefore its department of agriculture realises and accepts  its
responsibility towards the general growth and development of agriculture  in
the province, as well as towards  that  of  the  country  and  the  rest  of
Africa. In support of this statement, I mention a few  statistics  according
to which the Western Cape produces  the  following:  90%  of  the  country's
fruit for export; 62% of  the  country's  fruit  for  canning;  26%  of  all
vegetables; 41% of South Africa's wheat;  and,  not  surprisingly,  no  less
than 90% of South Africa's wine. We also contribute between 55% and  60%  of
the country's total agricultural exports.

Om ons visie te verwesenlik, om kliënte te help om mededingend te  wees,  om
globale sukses te kan behaal, om ten volle inklusief te kan wees  en  om  in
harmonie met die natuur te produseer,  is  die  Wes-Kaapse  departement  van
landbou strategies geposisioneer om die volgende voorrange  te  verwesenlik:
om gelyke toegang tot deelname aan die landbou te verseker en om  volhoubare
landelike  ontwikkeling  te  stimuleer,  om  die  mededingendheid  van  alle
landbouprodusente op die plaaslike, sowel as op nasionale en  internasionale
vlak te verbeter, en om die natuurlike hulpbronne  wat  aan  ons  beskikbaar
is, te bewaar om sodoende te sorg dat toekomstige geslagte daaruit  voordeel
kan trek.

Voortvloeiend uit hierdie voorrange, gaan die departement  hom  toespits  op
die volgende inisiatiewe: om landelike ontwikkeling te bevorder, om  dienste
aan opkomende boere uit te brei, om  die  ontwikkeling  van  waterbronne  te
bevorder, om navorsing en voorligtingsdienste aan die landbougemeenskap  uit
te brei, om voedselveiligheid en -sekuriteit  te  bevorder,  om  op  verdere
onderwys  en  opleiding  te  konsentreer  en  om  vennootskappe  met   ander
provinsies te versterk, veral met die Oos- en die  Noord-Kaap.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

To realise our vision to assist our clients to be  competitive,  to  achieve
global success, to be  fully  inclusive  and  to  produce  in  harmony  with
nature, the  Western  Cape's  department  of  agriculture  is  strategically
placed to achieve the  following  priorities:  to  ensure  equal  access  to
participation  in   agriculture   and   to   stimulate   sustainable   rural
development; to increase the competitiveness of all  agricultural  producers
at local level, as well as at  national  and  international  levels  and  to
protect the natural resources available to us and  to  ensure  in  so  doing
that future generations can benefit from it.

Flowing from these priorities the department would like  to  concentrate  on
the following initiatives; to promote rural development, to expand  services
to emerging farmers, to promote  the  development  of  water  resources,  to
expand research and extension services to  the  agricultural  community,  to
promote food safety and -security; to concentrate on further  education  and
training, and to strenghthen partnerships with other  provinces,  especially
the Eastern and Northern Cape.]

We see the process of Land Redistribution  for  Agricultural  Development  -
also known as the LRAD process - as a way to create  opportunities  for  our
historically disadvantaged citizens to combat  food  insecurity,  to  create
jobs and to make a contribution to the economy. It is our aim  to  settle  a
total of 7 000 land reform beneficiaries by the year 2005.

I would now like to refer to the progress made in this  process  so  far.  A
total of 3 944 land  reform  beneficiaries  are  participating  in  57  LRAD
projects that were approved from 2001 to the present. Remember that these  3
944 land reform beneficiaries are not  necessarily  all  farmers.  The  LRAD
projects are structured according to the business  model  and  as  such  the
individuals within the projects are beneficiaries, each one of them  playing
a specific  role  in  the  business.  Approximately  29  000  ha  have  been
transferred during the period August 2001 to March 2003.

The current list of  registered  applicants  indicates  that  at  least  100
additional LRAD  projects  are  outstanding  in  terms  of  business  plans,
meaning that there are at least another 6 000 to 7 000 people  who  wish  to
have access to land through this process. From 1994  to  2002  at  least  97
land reform projects for agricultural purposes were approved, including  the
above-mentioned 57 LRAD projects. The total cost of these  projects  amounts
to R132 240 976. The Western  Cape  province  has  7  000  white  commercial
farmers and we would like to settle at least the  same  number  of  emerging
farmers in agriculture - not necessarily  in  farming  itself,  but  in  the
wider agricultural chain.

Needless to say,  the  department  is  committed  to  continued  world-class
service  to  the  commercial  component  of  agriculture.  I  have   already
mentioned the important  role  that  commercial  agriculture  plays  in  the
economy of the province and of the country, and we will  continue  to  serve
our commercial  producers  with  state-of-the-art  research,  extension  and
training.

Die departement  sal  hom  beywer  vir  die  ontwikkeling  van  die  gepaste
tegnologie om die mededingendheid van produsente  te  ontwikkel  deur  sowat
205 dier- en gewasnavorsingsprojekte. Navorsing sonder voorligting  is  soos
om 'n boek te kryf, maar niemand toetelaat om dit te lees  nie.  Om  hierdie
rede beplan die departement om sowat 10 000 produsente  by  groepsessies  en
plaasbesoeke te betrek.

Dit is noodsaaklik vir die produsering  van  voedsel  vir  die  volk  om  in
balans en in harmonie met ons natuurlike omgewing  en  hulpbronne  te  wees.
Verskeie projekte, soos die skep van  kontoere,  dwarsmure,  dreinering  and
waterkanale word beoog om te bewaar en die landbougrond  van  die  provinsie
te verbeter. Die Wes-Kaap is 'n waterskaars provinsie en die departement  is
toegewy om vordering te bemiddel tot die optimale gebruik van water  in  die
landbousektor. Om hierdie rede hou die departement in  Mei  'n  waterberaad,
waartydens  alle  tersaaklike  belanghebbendes  bymekaar  sal  kom  om   die
situasie te bespreek  en  oplossings  te  vind.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The department will endeavour to develop  suitable  technology  to  develop
competitiveness by about 205 animal and  crop  research  projects.  Research
without counselling is like writing a book, but no one is  allowed  to  read
it. Therefore the department plans to  involve  10 000  producers  in  group
sessions and visits to farms.

It is imperative for the production of food that the  nation  should  be  in
balance and harmony with our  natural  environment  and  resources.  Various
projects, like the creation  of  contours,  retaining  walls,  drainage  and
water canals are envisaged to save and improve the agricultural land of  the
province. The Western Cape is a water-scarce province and the department  is
committed to facilitating the optimal usage of  water  in  the  agricultural
sector. For this reason, the department will have a  water  summit  in  May,
where all the relevant role-players will meet to discuss the  situation  and
find solutions.]

The Western Cape being a strong exporter of  agricultural  and  specifically
animal products, the department accepts the challenge as custodian  for  the
safety of  food  from  animal  origin.  To  this  end,  the  Directorate  of
Veterinary Services will, during the next year, inspect  and  monitor  about
642 ostrich and dairy export farms throughout the province. A programme  has
also been initiated to declare the province free  from  bovine  tuberculosis
and bovine brucellosis. To achieve this goal, the department  will  have  to
test more than 150 000 dairy cattle and almost 145 000 beef cattle.

Relevant and need-driven training remains one of  the  cornerstones  of  the
promotion of sustainable agriculture. It also serves  as  one  of  the  most
potent instruments to ensure equal access to  agriculture.  I  am  therefore
happy to report that approximately 52% of the training budget  goes  to  the
development  and  training   of   people   from   previously   disadvantaged
communities.

The  Elsenburg  College  of  Agriculture  provides  higher  certificate  and
diploma training to approximately 260 students annually. Through  a  renewed
focus on the provision of further education and  training,  the  aim  is  to
reach some 1 100 students, including practising and prospective farmers  and
farmworkers  from  previously   disadvantaged   communities.   Decentralised
training centres will also be developed at George and along the  West  Coast
to give people increased access to agricultural training facilities.

Die  Wes-Kaapse  departement  van  landbou  is  voornemens  om  sy  rol   as
voorloper, gids, beskermer en ondersteuner van die landbougemeenskap in  die
provinsie te speel deur voortgesette  dienslewering  en  toewyding  aan  die
skep van ekonomiese groei en voedselsekuriteit vir almal, tot  voordeel  van
ons provinsie, tot voordeel  van  ons  land  en  tot  voordeel  van  Afrika.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Western Cape Department of Agriculture intends  to  play  its  role  as
forerunner, guide, patron and supporter of  the  agricultural  community  in
the province through  sustained  service  delivery  and  commitment  to  the
creation of economic growth and food security for all,  to  the  benefit  of
our province, to the benefit of our country and to the  benefit  of  Africa.
[Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chairperson,  up  until  now,  I  am  still  convinced  that
agriculture is the backbone of the nation.  The  Managing  Director  of  the
Land Bank affirms this argument as follows:


  Farmers and their workers do the most sacred work of  all  feeding  South
  Africa. And after  all,  the  economy  of  the  country  is  predominatly
  agricultural and half of  its  economically  active  population  work  as
  labourers on commercial farms or as  small-scale  producers  in  communal
  areas.

The major part of my speech, will focus on programme 2 vis farmers'  support
and development. It is true that skewed participation and inequity exist  in
the agricultural  sector  and  have  become  critical  millstones;  critical
millstones  in  the  sense  that  whites,  representing  merely  6%  of  the
population, still control 70% of the fertile agricultural land, and that  55
000 white  commercial  farmers  appear  to  have  applied  pressure  on  our
Government  as  it  is  manifested  by  the  snail's  pace  at  which   land
redistribution takes place.

A survey indicates that the land redistribution  programme  has  managed  to
redistribute 2% of the designated farming land to  emerging  black  farmers,
which is far below the targeted 30% of land. However, I wish to commend  the
department for the progress made in respect of land restitution. What  could
be the reason for this slow pace in respect of land redistribution?

The fundamental issue  is  that  the  white  commercial  farming  sector  is
unwilling, although it has already been alluded to by our hon  Minister,  to
enter into  partnership  with  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders  to
redress the skewed participation and inequities in the agricultural sector.

This is demonstrated by the tendency  of  white  farmers  pitching  purchase
prices of farms under claim above  the  market-related  price  in  order  to
frustrate the land redistribution process, let alone the prolonging  of  the
time period, which will culminate in even more impossible prices.

Partnership  is  critical  in  order  to  avoid  frustrations  which   might
culminate in land ownership hostilities  in  future.  Prevention,  in  other
words, is better than cure. Once more, the Managing  Director  of  the  Land
Bank asserts that white farmers need to  do  more  to  help  emerging  black
farmers acquire land and learn modern agricultural  skills  and  techniques.
We fail to realise this, given that the other  partner  is  neither  willing
nor committed to the cause.

Willingness and  commitment  can't  be  successfully  realised  without  the
elements of compromise and sacrifice coming into play.  Compromise  in  this
sense refers to making a settlement by each  side  giving  up  part  of  its
demand, and of course, sacrifice refers to giving up  something  valued  for
the sake of something else more  important  or  worthy.  More  important  or
worthy in this sense refers to peace and stability.

After all,  we  have  overcome  insurmountable  milestones  in  our  country
precisely  through  the  willingness  of  all  parties  to  compromise   and
sacrifice, and not through the US or Bush  style.  Given  this  presentation
supra,  I  therefore  appeal  to  all  stakeholders,  especially  the  white
commercial farming community, to heed our  plea  to  enter  into  meaningful
partnership with our Government.

In the event of a failure to do so - I don't  know  -  the  Government  will
have to adopt a confrontational or  head-on  approach  to  the  land  reform
programme by imposing harsh policies like, among others,  one  farm  to  one
farmer to prevent  ownership  of  chains  of  farms  by  one  person.  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

[Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Mr Chairperson, hon Minister and  the  Deputy  Minister,
Adv Du Toit, hon members, it is a pleasure for me to  be  part  of  such  an
important debate.]

It is a bit unfortunate that as we are in this important  debate  there  are
members who are still using cowardly tactics of ``shoot-and-run,'' like  the
hon member Versfeld, who raised an issue  and  then  left  with  the  entire
white contingent of the DA, leaving the poor black Raju behind.  [Laughter.]
And, they went to the white laager. It is a pity, because I wanted  to  hand
over this leaflet to him so that he could read, just a paragraph,  where  it
says:


  The South African Government has shown its intent to keep South Africa on
  track with biotechnological research and development by  allocating  R400
  million over the  next  three  years  towards  its  biggest  ever  single
  research support for biotechnology.

This was said by Prof Eugene Cloete of the University of Pretoria.

Ngisachubeka nenkhulumo yami, ngitsandza  kusho  kutsi  leliTiko  leTekulima
neMhlaba   lingumhlahlandlela   ekucedzeni   buphuya   kanye    nelubhubhane

paragraph follows.)

[Continuing with my speech, I would like  to  say  that  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs is leading in pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty and overcoming the scourge of drought. It  is  one  department  that
plays a vital role in bringing back  the  dignity  and  land  to  the  black
communities  that  were  forcefully  removed  from   the   land   of   their
forefathers.]

On 20 April 1964, in the Rivonia Trial, Comrade Nelson Mandela said:

  The lack of human dignity experienced by Africans is the direct result of
  the policy of white supremacy.

This has reference  to  the  1913  and  1936  Land  Acts  which  saw  blacks
forcefully  removed  from  arable  land  to  barren  lands,  the   so-called
``homelands''. Those who remained were  to  be  exploited  as  cheap  labour
working in squalid conditions.

Today, 10 April, as we  commemorate  10  years  after  the  assasination  of
Comrade Cris Hani, we are not apologetic in our resolve to ensure  that  the
dispossessed and landless have access to land.

In keeping with the UN Decade on the Rights of Indigenous  Populations,  the
Ministry, through The Land Claims Commission, has  settled  claims  for  the
historically marginalised Khoisan communities including the Khomani  San  of
the  Southern  Kalahari,  the  Mier  community  and  the   San   people   of
Schmidtsdrift.

Many  communities,  covering  thousands  and  thousands  of  the  previously
disadvantaged households, have benefited from  LRAD,  the  Land  Restitution
and Land Tenure Reform Programmes. LRAD launched at  Nkomazi  in  Mpumalanga
in the year 2001, has a more developmental approach,  which  emphasises  the
delivery of land for productive and income-generating purposes.

The department has in its Budget Vote allocated  a  significant  amount  for
the mentoring  programmes  which  serves  as  support  structures  to  these
emerging farmers. This will build the  necessary  capacity  for  viable  and
sustainable  farming,  thus  enhancing  socioeconomic  development  in  this
emerging sector. It plays a significant role in pushing back  the  frontiers
of poverty.

It  is  in  this  context  that  we  support  the  Government's  target   to
redistribute 30% of agricultural land  among  the  previously  disadvantaged
citizens of this country. My colleague the hon Van Niekerk said it can  even
be more than 30% - how we wish that he, together with  his  other  colleague
farmers, can contribute more to this. This will  at  the  end  translate  to
about 25 million ha at a minimum target of 1,2 million ha per year.

As the fundamental changes occur, new challenges emerge, hence the  need  to
harmonise land ownership and disposal between all spheres of Government.  It
also calls for those who had benefited for so  long  to  be  responsive  and
partriotic in lending a helping hand to the previously marginalised.

In the spirit of the OAU Anthem, ``let all of us unite and toil together  to
give the best we have to Africa,  the  cradle  to  humankind  and  fount  of
culture.''

[We are very proud of our farmers  who  treat  their  employees  like  human
beings, those who build houses for their workers  and  pay  them  reasonable
living wages and respect their human rights.

However, I am strongly  against  farmers  who  are  like  Abraham  Swart  of
Spitzkop, near Nelspruit. Swart and his workers' leader  are  out  on  R5000
bail, after beating three workers, one of which was shot in  the  chest  and
foot by Mr Swart while he was trying to run away from that situation.

These workers  were  suffering  terrible  hardship  only  because  they  had
requested their pay for the three days' work which they  had  done  on  that
farm. There are many other outrageous  things  that  are  happening  on  the
farms, which show that some farmers still live in 1936.]

Generally, there is a gross violation of the Basic Conditions of  Employment
Act on the farms. Most of the workers are not registered, hence they  cannot
benefit  from  the  UIF.  There  are  elements  of  child   labour,   gender
discrimination, and people are subjected to subhuman living  conditions.  In
essence, it's where the poorest of the poor have their human rights  grossly
violated.

It is in this context that we stand by our hon Ministers -  Minister  Didiza
and Minister Mdladlana on the sectoral determination - key, amongst  others,
being the minimum wage and improved working conditions.

Let me also take this opportunity to commend hon  Minister  Didiza  and  her
colleagues in the Cabinet on the sterling work they are doing. They rose  to
the occasion when disaster struck, namely through veld fires,  floods,  etc.
We have seen them moving up and down those  communities  who  were  in  dire
need. This signifies a caring and responsive Government of the people.

This Ministry has ably dealt with animal disease outbreaks  like  the  foot-
and-mouth ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

member, it is clear that you are a pure Swati, you are not a Swati  by  mere
certification. [Laughter.]]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND   AFFAIRS:   Thank   you,
Chairperson, for the opportunity to speak again in  the  NCOP,  reacting  to
the debate.

The Minister sent me a note a while ago, and I am going to read it to you  -
she's writing my speeches!  [Laughter.]  She  says:  ``You  know,  the  NCOP
debate  is  always  substantive,  informative  and  enriching.''  How  true.
[Applause.] And, you know, the reason for that is that - other than  perhaps
what we have  in  the  National  Assembly  in  our  debates,  especially  on
agriculture; it's not the same in all sectors - here  we  have  persons  and
delegates and representatives, all of whom have direct contact with what  is
happening on ground level. They know the project, they've seen  the  people,
they've seen the land and that's what's making  the  difference  and  that's
why I think that this  has  got  a  big  role,  especially  with  regard  to
agriculture. Let's remain with what we have, and co-operative governance  is
and can be more of a success every day.

You know, I had a plan for a  speech,  but  the  Minister  hasn't  completed
writing my speech. She's also very busy! So I think I will spend most of  my
time reacting to some of the observations some people have made. But let  me
just, by way of introduction, refer to a few matters.

There has been reference to agricultural colleges, amongst  others,  by  the
Free State MEC. You know, this is a very important matter and we  must  take
it forward. I must say, at the moment the Ministry  is  not  satisfied  with
the progress that we are making with regard to agricultural colleges.  We've
got task teams, and we've got meetings  and  discussions,  but  somewhere  I
think a political intervention has to be  made  to  really  get  this  thing
going.

There are, for example,  joint  teams  between  education  and  agriculture.
There was a time that we said at the highest level we should  not  go  ahead
with this matter of the agricultural colleges before  we've  talked  to  the
provincial  MECs  and  the  provincial  heads  of  departments.  And  that's
happening, but I must also say that we're getting slow  responses  from  the
provincial heads of departments to move this matter forward. So I  think  we
must ask the politicians please to create some  heat  in  the  provinces  so
that we can move this matter. From the side of the  national  Government  we
will do what we can, because I think the right approach has  been  suggested
by the hon Motsoaledi.
With regard to intergovernmental relations,  I've  thought  about  this  for
many years and what we can do to make it  really  successful.  And  I  think
it's actually very simple. Much of intergovernmental relations is  conducted
on a day-to-day basis by officials on the phone to each other, in  meetings;
by politicians talking to each  other  and  by  Ministers  talking  to  each
other. I think the  most  important  matter  is  that  you  must  have  good
information  on  what  the  other  governments  are  doing.  The  provincial
governments must know what the national Government is  doing,  the  national
Government must know what the provincial governments are doing  and  on  all
levels, whether it's on a bureaucratic level or whether it's on a  political
level, good information is number one, because that  will  lead  to  what  I
regard  as  the  biggest  requirement  for  success   in   intergovernmental
relations. And that is to be respected  by  the  others.  You  need  respect
because if you don't have that basis of respect, apart from  what  political
party is running what province, it must be  based  on  respect  because  the
respect again is a factor of good human resource  administrative  practices,
good human relations  and  an  overall  approach  of  excellence  to  public
management.

When will  you  get  this  respect?  You  will  draw  respect  if  there  is
competence,  if  people  are  doing  their  work,  if  there  is   technical
competence in the province, if there is  technical  competence  at  national
level, then we will have that respect. And so we need a high-quality  Public
Service for this very difficult task  of  intergovernmental  relations.  One
can so easily fall into smallness, into  empire-building,  into  keeping  my
information for myself and putting gates on the information  flow.  I  think
that is just going to work to your own disadvantage.

Then the informal contacts  can  take  off,  when  you  have  this  respect.
Because intergovernmental relations are built, to a very  large  extent,  on
these informal contacts. And I would like to ask the  full-time  members  of
the NCOP, as well as the delegates, as well as the MECs  and  whoever  is  a
politician in the intergovernmental game, to please  help  this  country  to
get this right; to get this level of  respect  and  to  get  mature  in  our
intergovernmental relations. Keep the lines of communication open  and  have
transparency. Let it flow. I think that's really important.

From the side of the Ministry and the national department we  are  intiating
a memorandum of understanding on agricultural  intergovernmental  relations.
It's very difficult work, I must say, because sometimes  we  still  distrust
each other and that must just go out of the system.

What did we see in this debate? And I'll touch  on  what  some  people  have
said. We've seen an openness, a flow of  information  on  this  project  and
that project. Provinces are proud to  come  and  tell  what's  happening  in
their provinces and the national Government must know that  to  be  able  to
keep the money flowing in, to keep the frameworks flowing and to do what  we
should do in this regard.

Let me just thank the Rev Moatshe. He also referred to  the  garden  matters
and the starter packs. I think with regard to these starter  packs  we  need
more information coming in. Does it really work and are we really getting  a
national vibration through this country about producing food in  gardens?  I
think that's the type of roll-out that we want. We want  a  roll-out  and  a
national kind of feeling that this is our culture, to make  gardens.  And  I
appreciate everyone who has referred to that matter.

The hon Nkayi is not here now. He was making a lot about these  many  female
farmers that they have there in  the  Eastern  Cape.  I  am  very  happy  to
announce that we are going to stop them. The Minister has informed  me  that
the title of this competition is going to change. It's now going to  be  the
male farmer of the year. [Laughter.] [Applause.] This is so  that  the  Free
State also has a chance to win that competition. Did  I  misunderstand  you,
Minister? [Laughter.]

No, of  course  we  know  exactly  what  is  happening  there  and  we  also
congratulate the North West that also has one female farmer of the  year,  I
believe.

Unfortunately,  as  has  been  said  earlier,  Mrs  Versfeld  has  left  us,
presumably to go fishing. [Laughter.] But I think this  matter  on  the  ARC
has been answered sufficiently in the National Assembly by the Minister.  It
is a question of restructuring and  sometimes  it's  a  bit  hard  when  you
restructure, but you know you are moving to a better position. And  I  think
that is what we are asking support for now and I think we're getting it.  We
shouldn't get into a fight-back type  of  mood.  That  is  not  contributing
anything at all in this regard. I think a  positive  attitude  is  going  to
help a lot more.

I must say that we have some concern over  the  way  the  trust  deeds  were
drafted for all these different trusts, the mayor's trust and whatever.  For
example, we're trying to save the potato trust and Potato SA at the  moment.
But if you start looking at the drafting that  went  into  those  deeds,  Mr
Chief Whip, please, it's unbelievable the level of ignorance that was  used,
because it can't work. We have now got one trust for which, because of  poor
drafting of a section, we actually can't legally appoint  new  trustees.  It
was really sloppy work that went into that and the  instruction  is  already
out that we're going to look at all the trust deeds  through  the  NAMC  and
see what must be  done.  But  we  should  not  use  the  existing  trust  to
undermine the ARC. I must warn against that. We shouldn't use  that  because
then we're on a conflictual road which I think is not going to be  good  for
anyone.

The hon Chief Whip of the Council has referred to  the  provincial  staffing
position as have  other  members  like  the  hon  provincial  minister  from
Limpopo. In the intergovernmental relations report just out, that  is  shown
to be the single biggest problem for  provincial  agriculture.  It  must  be
addressed successfully. I think it is being addressed successfully at a  lot
of places, but if you just take - I am also talking from  memory  -  Limpopo
has  about  3  000  supernumeraries  in  agriculture.  It  is  a  legacy  of
apartheid. We know that. It comes from the way  in  the  old  bantustans  in
which agriculture was run. It's a legacy we have, but we must solve it.  And
my personal opinion is that the provinces must get assistance to solve  this
problem. In the Western Cape there is only one supernumerary.  So  it's  far
easier for the Western Cape to be effective, and they are effective  and  we
congratulate them on that. But you must remember  you  didn't  have  one  of
those TBVC areas in the Western Cape. It makes a difference and you can  see
it. That's exactly what apartheid meant. You get this type of problem.

So, Mr Surty, I thank you for mentioning that matter and also  I'm  so  glad
about Taung getting up. It was the area next door to where I grew up  and  I
think it's got great promise and we're going to drive that matter.

MEC Oelrich of the  Free  State  just  briefly  made  mention  of  municipal
relations. I really think that in agriculture we must take the  local  level
of government far more seriously. You know, the rates Bill is coming in  and
that must be a functional type of system. Where does the  extension  officer
really sit? If you go into the deep rural areas you will  see  he's  got  an
office there in the municipal offices.  I've  seen  it  so  often.  He's  in
direct contact. If a road is a problem in a rural area it's related  to  the
municipality and  this  extension  officer  picks  it  up  when  he's  doing
agriculture work in the district. There must be  a  relationship  there  and
it's something which the provinces must work out and bring to us so that  we
can talk about that matter.

The hon Van Niekerk had a very interesting point of the  30%  of  production
that he argued here. I do think that's the wrong word; it's not the  30%  of
production that's really at stake. You see, the land as such - as  has  been
argued by the hon Windvoël, correctly, that is the correct  position  -  has
got a deeper meaning than just the pure production value of it. It  is  this
history of your dignity being taken away  by  access  to  land  having  been
denied.

So access to land is not merely production value. But what is true  of  your
argument, and I think that we must consider this matter carefully,  is  that
the value of the land in this country is not the same everywhere. There  are
huge disparities in the value of land. So  perhaps  we  must  start  talking
about the value of land, because in the deep  Northern  Cape  the  value  of
land can't be what it is  in  the  high-rainfall  areas  along  the  coastal
areas, obviously. It can't be that. But I also want to say, just sending  up
a flyer, that we should also think of redistribution in urban  areas,  where
the business and the money is. But let me leave it at that.

Oh, yes, and thank you for the mention  of  aquaculture  by  more  than  one
speaker here. I've got some notes on aquaculture. I  don't  know  whether  I
can really go into the matter. I can only say this: It is by  far  the  most
efficient protein-production method. What you put in and what you  get  out.
It's the most effective method. And  I  must  say  that  the  department  is
looking into this matter.

Could I then just thank you for the opportunity for me and the  Minister  to
have been here. My time is gone. Thank you, Sir.

Debate concluded.

                       DEEDS REGISTRIES AMENDMENT BILL
                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson, I have  a  statement  on  the  Deeds  Registries
Amendment Bill.

The purpose of the amendment is twofold. It seeks,  firstly,  to  bring  the
Deeds Registries  Act  in  line  with  new  legislative  changes  that  have
occurred in  respect  of  customary  marriages,  and,  secondly,  to  confer
juristic personality on trusts to enable  compliance  with  the  legislation
governing trust property in South Africa.

The Deeds Registry is a statutory instrument that records information  about
the ownership, description,  size  and  date  of  acquisition  of  immovable
properties.  Section  17  of  the  Deeds  Registries   Act   regulates   the
registration of fixed properties in the name of married persons.

Because of the discrimination that took place against black South  Africans,
customary marriages were not put on the  same  legal  footing  as  so-called
western marriages.
This  discriminatory  practice  was  ended  with  the   enactment   of   the
Recognition of Customary  Marriages  Act  of  1998,  which  gives  customary
marriages the same legal protection. However, the new  matrimonial  property
system which was introduced by the 1998 Act  was  not  accommodated  in  the
Deeds Registries Act.

The amendment inserts a new paragraph (d) to  make  sure  that  where  fixed
property is registered in the name of a  person  who  on  the  date  of  the
registration was a party to  a  marriage  governed  by  the  Recognition  of
Customary Marriages Act, the Registrar of Deeds must endorse the  change  in
status or make a note to the  effect  that  the  person  is  a  party  to  a
marriage in community of property, as the case may be.

The second reason why this amending Bill is necessary is to provide for  the
registration of immovable property in the name of a trust.  The  common  law
does  not  recognise  trusts  as  juristic  persons  and  does  not   permit
registration of rights in land in the name of any body other than a  natural
or juristic person.

A consequence of our colonial history has been the  practice  of  immigrants
from Britain to form trusts and register rights  in  land  in  the  name  of
trustees. This has resulted in rights in land being registered in  the  name
of trustees without mentioning the name of the beneficiary of the  trust  in
the deeds concerned.

This is not in line with the Trust Property Control Act which provides  that
trust property must be registered in such a manner that  it  is  clear  from
the registration that it is trust property. Furthermore the  Trust  Property
Control Act states that trust property does not, on  insolvency,  form  part
of the Trustee's insolvent estate.

It is necessary therefore to amend the Deeds Registries Act so as to  confer
juristic personality on trusts to ensure compliance with the Trust  Property
Control Act.

Therefore the House supports the amending Bill. I thank you.

[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declaration of vote:

Dr E A CONROY: Dankie, Voorsitter. Ek het 'n jaar gelede,  namens  die  Nuwe
NP, deur middel van 'n privaatlidwetgewingvoorstel aan die hand  gedoen  dat
ernstige oorweging aan die hersiening van Wet 95 van 1986 geskenk word.

Ek het in dié voorlegging genoem dat dringende aandag aan die swak  openbare
beeld van deeltiteleienaarskap  geskenk  moet  word  deur  onder  meer  swak
boustandaarde in deeltitelskemas te voorkom, deur eienaars teen swak en,  in
sommige gevalle, gewetenlose administrateurs te beskerm, en  in  die  proses
'n unieke Suid-Afrikaanse deeltitelmodel op die been te bring.  Ek  het  ook
reeds in daardie  stadium  betoog  vir  die  skep  van  'n  kantoor  van  'n
deeltitel-ombudsman,  wat  dispute  vinnig,  goedkoop  en  doeltreffend  kan
besleg.

Dit  is  daarom  verblydend  dat  die  Minister   verlede   week   in   haar
begrotingsrede in die ander Huis aangedui  het,  en  ek  wil  haar  daarvoor
bedank, dat sy die skep van 'n kantoor van 'n  ombudsman  oorweeg  en,  deur
gereelde wysigings aan die betrokke wet, aandag  aan  die  problematiek  van
deeltiteleienaarskap  sal  skenk.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Thank you, Chairperson. A year ago I proposed, on behalf  of
the New NP, by way of a private member's legislative proposal  that  serious
consideration be given to the revision of Act 95 of 1986.

In this submission I mentioned that urgent attention should be given to  the
poor public image of sectional title ownership by,  inter  alia,  preventing
poor building standards in sectional title  schemes,  by  protecting  owners
against incompetent and, in some  cases,  unscrupulous  administrators,  and
thus creating a unique South African sectional  title  model.  Moreover,  at
that stage I also advocated the creation of an office of a  sectional  title
ombudsman who can settle disputes swiftly, cheaply and efficiently.

It is therefore heartening that the Minister  indicated  last  week  in  her
budget speech in the other House, and I want to thank  her  for  this,  that
she is considering the creation of  an  office  of  an  ombudsman  and  will
devote attention  to  the  problematics  of  sectional  title  ownership  by
regular amendments of the Act concerned.]

Chairperson, I bring this matter to bear as it  is  closely  linked  to  the
Deeds  Registries  Amendment  Bill  which  is  being  discussed  today.   It
strengthens the New NP's belief and bolsters our confidence that active  and
responsible attention is being given to all aspects of private ownership  of
fixed property.

The New NP strongly supports the Deeds Registries Amendment  Bill.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]
Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Ms J KGOALI: Chairperson, on a point of order: I just  wanted  to  find  out
from you whether it is parliamentary that the  hon  Versveld  raises  issues
and runs away,  and  when  the  Minister  has  responded,  she  comes  back.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Thank you.  It  is  not  parliamentary,  but  I
wonder whether she can actually respond to that within this short  space  of
time. She's got no response. [Interjections.] Thank you. Do you want to  say
something, Mrs Versveld? No. That concludes the business of the day.

The Council adjourned at 16:56.
