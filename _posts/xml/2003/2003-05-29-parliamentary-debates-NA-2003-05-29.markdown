                        SUDDEN DEATH OF MR R J HEINE

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, it is with sadness that  I  inform  members
that our colleague from the DA, Mr R J Heine, has passed away suddenly.  The
House will pay tribute to Mr Heine on Tuesday.

                        CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L J MODISENYANE (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  according  to  media  reports,  a
spate of criminal and violent incidents  has  hit  schools.  It  is  further
reported  that  in  the  majority  of  these  cases  the  perpetrators  were
invariably learners who  were  causing  fellow  learners  either  to  become
traumatised or afraid to attend school.

The ANC believes that national  Government,  together  with  the  provincial
education departments, have created an adequate  legislative  framework  and
implemented policy measures to  ensure  that  all  schools  are  safeguarded
against incidents of this nature. The learners  of  these  schools  have  an
inalienable right to the same protective measures as their  counterparts  in
better resourced public schools.

The ANC empathises with these traumatised learners and therefore  encourages
them to engage, through their  learner  representative  councils,  with  the
school governing bodies to ensure that their schools  are  indeed  safe  and
secure places of learning. We further wish to assure  all  learners  in  our
country,  especially  during  National  Child  Protection  Week,   that   as
Government we shall continue to push back the frontiers  that  stifle  their
development and potential.  We  call  on  all  school  governing  bodies  to
mobilise, and highlight the problem of violence in schools. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Before  taking  the  next  member's  statement,  I  think  it's
appropriate that we welcome  and  acknowledge  in  our  midst  some  of  the
youngest visitors we've had to the public gallery. [Applause.]  All  of  you
are most welcome. We're very glad you're with us,  and  please  keep  coming
and keep in touch with us, and you come and tell us what's wrong out  there!
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

  MINIMUM WAGES IN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR - IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C R REDCLIFFE  (DA):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  Premier  van  Limpopo,
premier Ramatlodi, sê  in  vandag  se  Business  Day  dat  die  voorgestelde
toepassing  van  minimum  lone  in  die  landbousektor  werkgeleenthede  sal
vernietig.

Uiteindelik klink daar 'n stem van helderheid op uit die moeras  van  slegte
nuus. Hierdie waarskuwing komende van 'n senior ANC-premier  is  in  skrille
kontras  met  die  Minister  van  Arbeid  se  optrede.   Premier   Ramatlodi
verteenwoordig  'n  uitgebreide  landelike  gebied  wat  afhanklik  is   van
werkgeleenthede in die landbousektor. Hy is duidelik in voeling met  wat  op
die grond gebeur. In die bykans 10 jaar sedert die ANC aan die bewind  gekom
het, is 1 miljoen werkgeleenthede  verloor.  Nagenoeg  42%  van  alle  Suid-
Afrikaners sit sonder werk.

Ek daag die agb Minister van Arbeid uit om te erken dat sy  planne,  ondanks
die goeie bedoelings, eerder skade aanrig as goed  doen.  Die  Minister  kan
nie die kommentaar van premier  Ramatlodi  ignoreer  nie.  As  Minister  van
Arbeid is dit sy taak  om  werkgeleenthede  te  beskerm,  nie  om  hulle  te
vernietig  nie.  Dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   member’s   statement
follows.)

[Mr C R REDCLIFFE (DA): Madam  Speaker,  the  Premier  of  Limpopo,  Premier
Ramatlodi, said in today's Business Day that  the  proposed  application  of
minimum wages in the agricultural sector would destroy job opportunities.

At last we hear the sound of a clear voice out of the morass  of  bad  news.
This warning, coming from a senior ANC Premier, is in  glaring  contrast  to
the Minister of Labour's action. Premier Ramatlodi represents  an  extensive
rural area which is dependent  on  job  opportunities  in  the  agricultural
sector. He is obviously in  touch  with  what  is  happening  at  grassroots
level. In the almost 10 years since the ANC came into power, 1  million  job
opportunities  have  been  lost.  About  42%  of  all  South  Africans   are
unemployed.

I dare  the  Minister  of  Labour  to  admit  that  in  spite  of  his  good
intentions, his plans have done harm rather than good. The  Minister  cannot
ignore the comments of Premier Ramatlodi. As Minister of Labour  it  is  his
task to protect job opportunities, not to destroy them. Thank you.]

               SAPS CRIME AWARENESS CAMPAIGN IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Chief M W HLENGWA (IFP): Madam Speaker, on Sunday, the 25th of May 2003  the
SAPS held a crime  awareness  campaign  roadshow,  campaigning  on  HIV/Aids
awareness and drug abuse. This  campaign  was  held  within  their  area  of
operation in the Thoyana rural area around Amanzimtoti, KwaZulu-Natal.

Members of the SAPS, community leaders, educators, schoolchildren,  as  well
as specially invited guest speakers all made contributions on  the  day  and
helped ensure that it was a success. HIV/Aids,  crime  and  drug  abuse  are
just three of the many issues that we, and in particular the youth of  South
Africa, are faced with almost every day of our lives.

Campaigns like these do help in  educating  people  and  creating  awareness
around serious issues such as HIV/Aids, crime and drug abuse.  It  was  both
pleasing and encouraging that the campaign was  well  attended.  This  shows
that  people  are  concerned  about  the  serious  issues  that  were  being
discussed. I would like to thank the SAPS in Amanzimtoti for the effort  and
hard work put into the co-ordination of the roadshow, and I hope that  there
will be more in future. I thank you.

        TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES ON HIV/AIDS IN THE WORKPLACE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P A C HENDRICKSE (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Minister of  Labour,  the  hon
Membathisi Mdladlana, launched the technical  assistance  guidelines,  TAGs,
on HIV/Aids on the 26th of May 2003. This is part of Government's  programme
in meeting the global and national challenge of Aids in society.

Like other ANC Government programmes, the  technical  assistance  guidelines
are premised on the  fact  that  HIV  causes  Aids  and  that  socioeconomic
factors such as poverty play a crucial role in the spread and impact of  the
disease. These guidelines stipulate that employees have a  legal  right  not
to be dismissed for  being  HIV-positive.  Employers  must  deal  with  HIV-
related grievances in an efficient and effective manner in order  to  manage
the pandemic in the workplace effectively.

The launch of  these  guidelines  reflect  the  Government's  commitment  to
protect workers who have been infected with HIV/Aids. These  guidelines  are
part of the  broader  Government  programmes  which  have  a  proactive  and
integrated approach to prevention and management of the disease.

The ANC welcomes these guidelines as a major contribution to protecting  the
rights of  workers  living  with  HIV/Aids.  We  further  believe  that  the
implementation of these guidelines will assist in managing  the  disease  in
the workplace. [Applause.]

                   SEXUAL OFFENCES AND VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D M BAKKER (New NP): Madam Speaker, this week is Child  Protection  Week,
which once again places the emphasis on the  plight  of  so  many  of  South
Africa's children. In this regard we are shocked and angered to  read  about
a teacher arrested and charged with sexually abusing 10 schoolgirls.

The New NP is concerned about the high incidence of sexual  abuse,  indecent
assault and assault in  our  schools,  because  schools  in  particular  are
supposed to be a safe environment for children, and educators  are  supposed
to be people children can trust and look up to. The Minister of  Education's
reply to a New NP question regarding  sexual  abuse,  indecent  assault  and
assault in our schools is a serious charge  against  us,  the  lawmakers  of
this country.
According to the Minister's reply, educators in all  provinces,  except  for
the Eastern Cape which did not respond to the question, had been  guilty  of
either rape, indecent assault or assault over the  past  two  years.  During
2001 and 2002 there were approximately 204 reported cases  of  rape,  sexual
molestation or indecent assault by educators. There were also more than  200
reported cases of assault by educators on learners.

The New NP believes that if we can't stop our children from  falling  victim
to these evils,  we  have  failed  them.  Educators  found  guilty  of  such
offences must be severely punished and not be  allowed  ever  again  to  set
foot on any schoolground, and these cases should be  properly  investigated.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

                CURATORSHIP FOR MPUMALANGA HEALTH DEPARTMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I M CACHALIA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the  ANC  notes  that  the  Mpumalanga
Health Department has been placed under curatorship.

A task team has been set up to investigate and assist the  MEC  for  Health,
Ms Manana, to ensure and improve accountability and service delivery.

The ANC welcomes the move by the Mpumalanga provincial government  to  place
this department under curatorship. This move reflects the commitment of  the
ANC to obtain  proficient  and  accountable  government.  It  is  a  further
demonstration of the commitment of the ANC Government to  improving  service
delivery and achieving a better life for all our people.

The ANC hopes that the task team will finalise its  report  without  further
delay so  that  political  representatives  can  interact  with  the  issues
contained in the report. I thank you.

                         RELEASE OF CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N C NKABINDE (UDM): The UDM expresses its  horror  at  the  news  of  the
incident of necklacing that took  place  in  Bramfisherville.  The  incident
must  be  condemned  as  an  act  of  cruelty  that  has  no  place   in   a
constitutional  democracy.  However,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that   this
incident, like many other vigilante actions that are increasingly coming  to
light, is symptomatic of the high crime rate in this country. This does  not
mean that people have a right or excuse to  take  the  law  into  their  own
hands. What it does mean is that Government is failing to deal with crime.

South Africans who are largely peace-loving and  nonviolent  are  no  longer
willing to sit around idly whilst their possessions are  stolen,  and  their
loved ones are raped and murdered. In the face of this growing  crisis,  the
Government continues to stick to its  aggressive  and  stubborn  refusal  to
release regular crime statistics. South Africans  have  the  right  to  know
which areas, which activities and what times are most likely to expose  them
to crime. Sadly, they are being deprived of this life-saving information.

It seems the Government has one eye on next year's election, and  fears  the
exposure of the unfulfilled promises of a safer country. I thank you.

                     PAYMENTS FROM DISASTER RELIEF FUND

                            (Member's statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (VF): Mevrou die Speaker, in die Suid-Kaap  het  die  ergste
oorstroming in menseheugenis onlangs plaasgevind. Talle boere het alles  wat
hulle oor dekades opgebou het, in enkele minute verloor.

Die  VF  is  dankbaar  vir  die  vloedrampfonds  wat  ingestel  is  om   die
betrokkenes by te staan in hierdie krisis. Mense wat  skade  gely  het,  het
dan ook reeds hulle skade aangemeld en by die  vloedrampfonds  geregistreer.
By navraag blyk dit nou dat dit van 12 maande tot 3 jaar kan duur  voor  die
rampfonds enige bedrae geld sal kan uitbetaal.
Die doel met 'n rampfonds is om persone by te staan wat deur  getref  is  'n
ramp wat buite hulle beheer was, en as gevolg waarvan hulle hul  nou  in  'n
finansiële krisis bevind. Dit is om te voorkom dat hulle  uiteindelik  alles
as gevolg van die ramp verloor. Op hierdie tydstip is van  die  banke  besig
om van hierdie  boere  uit  te  koop,  omdat  hulle  vanweë  die  ramp  tans
kontantvloeiprobleme ondervind.

Wat tans gebeur, is uiters onregverdig teenoor hierdie boere. Teen  die  tyd
dat die rampfonds oor 12 maande uitbetaal, is dit te laat om  enige  verskil
aan hulle finansiële posisie te maak. Die vraag  is:  Is  daar  geen  manier
waarop die administrasie en uitbetaling  van  hierdie  fonds  bespoedig  kan
word ten einde hierdie onreg teenoor  mense  te  voorkom  nie?  Ek  dank  u.
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Madam Speaker, the worst floods in living memory recently occurred  in  the
Southern Cape. Within a few minutes several  farmers  lost  everything  that
they have built up for years.
The FF is grateful for the flood disaster relief fund that  was  established
to assist these people in their plight. People  who  suffered  damages  have
already reported their damages  and  registered  with  the  disaster  relief
fund. Following enquiries, it now  seems  that  it  would  take  between  12
months to 3 years before the fund can pay out any money.

The aim of a relief fund is to support  people  who  find  themselves  in  a
financial crisis as a result of a  disaster  beyond  their  control.  It  is
eventually an attempt to ensure that  they  do  not  lose  everything  as  a
result of such a disaster. At this stage some of the banks are  busy  buying
out these farmers because they, as a result  of  this  disaster,  experience
cash flow problems.

What is happening now is extremely unfair  towards  these  farmers.  By  the
time that the disaster relief fund pays out in twelve months' time, it  will
be too late  to  make  any  difference  to  their  financial  position.  The
question is: Is there no other way in which the  administration  and  payout
of these funds could be hastened in order to prevent this injustice  towards
people? I thank you.]

                    DEVELOPMENTS IN MIDDLE EAST SITUATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B M KOMPHELA (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  the  ANC  notes  that  the  National
Palestinian Authority  and  the  Israeli  government  approved  the  Quartet
Roadmap. This roadmap is a plan aimed at bringing about an end to the  legal
occupation of Palestine. The ANC is of the view that an endorsement  of  the
Quartet Roadmap by both the Palestinian National Authority and  the  Israeli
government is an encouraging development in the creation of  conditions  for
peace in the region.

The ANC is particularly encouraged by the fact that,  for  the  first  time,
the Israeli government has given  a  formal  recognition  for  the  need  to
create  an  independent  Palestinian  state.  We  hope  that   the   Israeli
government will not allow itself to be detracted from a long walk  to  peace
and freedom. I thank you. [Applause.]

                     BOTCH-UP BY STATISTICS SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's statement)

Mr C M LOWE (DA): Madam Speaker, South  Africa's  credibility  and  hard-won
monetary and macroeconomic policy lie in serious doubt, some  would  say  in
tatters, because of a major botch-up at Stats SA. It cannot be shrugged  off
as an error by the Minister of  Finance,  who  must  now  account  to  hard-
pressed taxpayers why and how they are paying for this  mess  with  inflated
interest rates. At best, it was  an  error  based  on  a  serious  error  of
judgment, which in itself is inexcusable and deeply concerning.

At worst,  it  is  a  monumental  blunder  whose  consequences  are  already
reverberating around the globe and  which  affects  the  monthly  budget  of
every single South African. [Interjections.] They are paying the  price  for
Stats SA's incompetence. Mortgage repayments, car loans, overdrafts,  credit
card payments and furniture HPs - hundreds of rands  every  month  have  all
been overstated and all overpaid by millions of  South  Africans.  How  many
jobs have also been lost? It is unbelievable that, having already  requested
a full CPIX review nearly a year ago, the Minister did not pick up on  these
errors as part of that process.

Madam Speaker, as the responsible line Minister  for  Stats  SA,  he  should
have the courage and the courtesy to account for this blunder, and  say  so.
Thank you.

                   POLICE INEPTITUDE IN PHILLIPI TRIANGLE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr T E VEZI (IFP):  Madam  Speaker,  the  community  of  Phillipi  triangle,
comprising Victoria Mxenge, Vukuzenzele, and Ekuphumuleni  suburbs  in  Cape
Town, is facing increasing criminal activity.  This  community  is  situated
next to the notorious Landsdowne Rd  and  Duinefontein  Rd  intersection,  a
favourite thoroughfare for car hijackers hitting motorists  at  intersection
robots. This community  is  trying  very  hard  to  root  out  the  criminal
activity, and they have formed a forum addressing safety issues.

To this end the Community Organisation Resource Centre,  the  South  African
Homeless People's Federation and the People's Dialogue meet once a month  to
discuss crime and other community development  issues.  This  community  is,
however, concerned about  the  lack  of  support,  support  they  should  be
receiving from the Nyanga  Police  Station  under  whose  jurisdiction  they
fall. On one occasion they had to lie to the police to  make  them  come  to
their rescue, and say there was a house with  dagga  in  it,  to  make  them
come.

They failed to get an urgent response from the police station  on  reporting
a rape case. The police station did not send anybody to help  them.  To  the
false alarm on the dagga incident, the police sent five cars to control  the
situation. The Phillipi Triangle has thus informed those who attended  their
forum, including the Western Cape  MEC  for  Safety  and  Security  and  the
Nyanga  station  commissioner,  that  they  would  rather  report   criminal
elements to the taxi bosses than go the police.

 This situation needs to be addressed to inculcate the community's trust  in
the local police. I thank you.

                         ABDUCTION AND MURDER OF MAN

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss T E LISHIVHA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the 40-year-old Mr Dovan  Makato,  a
member of the SAPS in  Limpopo  at  Mara  police  station  was  abducted  on
Tuesday, 13 May this year at his house at Saamkom. His dead body  was  found
the following day, not so far from the police station  in  Vivo  Road.  Four
suspects, amongst them a well-known teacher, were arrested as  a  result  of
whistle-blowing by the community. One suspect is still at large.

The ANC welcomes the role played by the community of  Saamkom  in  assisting
the police to apprehend these criminals. This confirms  our  view  that  the
people, working together with the police, can successfully  win  the  battle
against crime, and build safer and more secure communities.  The  ANC  calls
on other communities to emulate this shining example.  We  hope  that  these
alleged criminals will be put on trial, and that justice  is  meted  out  as
soon as possible. I thank you. [Applause.]

                               LAUNCH OF NACSA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs A VAN WYK (New NP): Yesterday the New NP discussed  with  the  Director-
General of Arts and  Culture,  Dr  Itumeleng  Mosala,  the  tension  between
himself and the interim steering committee and Network of Arts  and  Culture
South Africa following his withdrawal as keynote  speaker  at  their  launch
next Friday. The DG cordially expressed  his  willingness  to  work  towards
resolving the problem. The launch of this network  will  establish  a  much-
needed body to represent the interests of this wide-ranging sector. It  will
provide a one-stop communications channel that could simplify  the  work  of
the Minister and the DG.

The unfortunate misunderstanding should be cleared up as soon  as  possible,
and the New NP has indicated that it  is  prepared  to  act  as  facilitator
between  the  department  and  Nacsa.  Friendly  relations  should  be   re-
established as soon as possible. The public is  entitled  to  good  cultural
services, as well as the sorely neglected culture  and  heritage  sector  of
South Africa. It is time to unlock the  economic  and  social  potential  of
arts and culture in a focused way, and the New NP calls on Minister  Ngubane
and the department to emulate the successes of  the  Department  of  Science
and Technology which falls within his own Ministry. Thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon  members,  the  ACDP  has  advised  us  that  as  today  is
Ascension Day, they would not be participating in the  Assembly.  We  should
therefore not have indicated them as wishing to  give  members'  statements.
That leaves two slots from today, one of which will go to the ANC,  and  one
to the DA. Does the ANC have a member who wishes to make  a  statement?  DA?
Don't invent one if you don't have one. [Laughter.]  This  applies  to  both
sides. I think, in that case, we will now allow any Minister who  wishes  to
make a response.

                               COMBATING CRIME

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY:  Madam  Speaker,  could  I  please  get
guidance from you on how you would like me to  deal  with  the  issues  that
have been raised. There are a number of questions and it is my intention  to
respond to all of them. Can I get guidance?

The SPEAKER: Order! I think there were about three, if  I  noted  carefully.
We will allow you a little leeway since we have time. Try  and  keep  it  to
the point, please.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you very much.  Firstly,  let  me
say that we in this House all know that the issue of crime is a matter  that
we are dealing with, with the resources that are available  to  us.  Members
also know that we have been appealing to everyone in the House that we  need
information. We need assistance and information from all  members  in  order
for us to deal with crime. I am happy that there  are  children  up  in  the
gallery who possibly are conversant with  our  Crime  Stop  programme.  That
programme helps them to understand matters  of  child  abuse,  matters  that
relate to  drug  abuse,  and  issues  that  relate,  for  instance,  to  the
ownership of firearms in South Africa.

I therefore hope that they as children will always do what we  ask  them  to
do in all these cases - come forward and give information to the  police  so
that cases that relate  to  crimes  that  are  committed  against  them  are
investigated. I am grateful to Inkosi Hlengwa for  the  observation  he  has
made, and I do want to assure him that we have programmes of this nature  at
all times.
Yesterday I did indicate a number of operations  we  have  mounted  to  deal
with the issues of crime in South Africa. He will find now and  again  units
from the SA Police Service who mount the operations  that  he  has  referred
to. I can assure him that in KZN, if he goes to all the policing areas  that
we have there, the police will tell him about the programmes that they  have
to deal with the matter of crime and the mobilisation of our people to  give
us information.

With respect to what the hon Bakker was saying, it is true. I mean we  can't
tolerate the commission of crime in this country and  we  must  ensure  that
criminals are put behind bars, but as we  say  all  the  time:   The  police
cannot claim the monopoly on being the only ones who can  deal  with  issues
of crime. We need the support of our people so that we can deal with  crimes
and criminality in our country.

Of course, I don't know what the  policy  of  the  UDM  is  with  regard  to
combating crime, but I think it is our responsibility  as  members  of  this
House to try to educate members of that party and at least to say to them  -
which  we  believe  is  a  very,  very  simple  fact  to  understand:  Crime
statistics are not life-saving tools. You  can't  say  that  for  people  to
avoid crime, they must know statistics that relate to crime  and  that  that
will save their lives. [Applause.]

I am also happy that in Phillipi there is  a  movement  of  people  who  are
trying to assist the police, but what I want to do  is  appeal  to  the  hon
member. Please write a report and submit it to us, because if police do  not
respond to cries for help, they are violating the  very  mandate  that  they
have for the safety and security  of  our  people.  It  is  a  very  serious
dereliction of duty, and  we  would  want  to  bring  disciplinary  measures
against police officials who  act  in  that  way.  [Applause.]  But  please,
everyone of  us  must  tell  our  people  that  we  will  not  tolerate  the
establishment  of  vigilante  groups,  because  they  themselves  slip  into
criminality. We can't allow that in South Africa. [Applause.]  I  say  thank
you very much to the hon Leshivha  for  what  she  has  raised.  The  police
require this kind of support. When one of their own has been killed,  people
rally around the bereaved family. It is important for us when this  happens.
We again want information so that those who have perpetrated this crime  are
arrested. Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

                              SAFETY IN SCHOOLS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you very much for your  forbearance.  There
were two and half questions addressed to me. [Laughter.] The first  was  the
ANC statement. I am a bit on the short side, so I  won't  claim  three  full
questions as my predecessor has claimed. Let me put some general  principles
to the House, which I think will meet our agreements.

One, no form of violence is acceptable in  our  society;  two,  no  form  of
violence, especially the use of firearms,  is  acceptable  in  our  schools;
three, schools cannot be either prison  houses  or  armed  encampments,  and
four, one can't have the police going to 27 000 schools in South Africa.  So
there is no point in asking for spot checks, and  periodic  checks,  because
Minister Tshwete and I went to a school which was a no-go area in  the  East
Rand four years ago. We brought  the  police  in  there,  we  exercised  our
discretion and, in fact, within a year the school  had  achieved  marvellous
matric results when a year before it  was  totally  derelict.  So  the  next
point to remember - I think it's number five - is that we need to  have  the
community involved and the resolution does say that. We have got to get  the
school governing bodies, the principals and the teachers and  the  learners'
councils involved.

Self-enforcement in the end is the  most  important  one,  and  I  was  very
pleased that in Phillipi the sense of the  community  was  to  give  up  the
people who had committed the offence. The last  point  is  simply  that  the
Minister of Safety and Security and I,  and  particularly  his  predecessor,
worked out the National School Safety Policy and I call it in my  department
the ``Steve Tshwete policy''. I attribute it to him, and this  is  the  most
comprehensive approach to school safety. I mentioned the other day  that  in
one of the places where trouble was taking place, there was  no  fence.  So,
in the past four years, hundreds of schools have  been  fenced.  That  is  a
start. Secondly, all schools now have janitors or caretakers who  should  be
at the gate. Next, of course very important, is to instil in the school  the
idea that disputes must be settled peacefully.

I particularly say to those who run very high horses from  a  slightly  left
position, who say that we must admit all children to school,  that  part  of
the problem of discipline is that we have over-aged children,  and  some  of
the provinces say: But you can't have a child three years  older  than  that
age group, which means we have 21/22 year olds. They  should  really  be  in
technical colleges and community centres. However, I think if there is  this
broad approach, we can all do these things together. Let  me  announce  that
the Minister of Safety and Security and I will now be visiting schools,  not
selectively, but all, to bring this message across, and we will also to  act
as public representatives to ensure that the message gets across.

The second question asked by the New NP ... You know, I  certainly  remember
the first time when we had a conference on sex abuse  and  on  HIV,  when  I
coined this phrase that we must protect the ``right to innocence'',  not  in
a criminal sense, but children must be allowed to develop in their own  time
and experience those wonderful experiences that many of us  went  through  -
happy or unhappy - but in their own time and in  their  own  period,  rather
than prematurely. The point about sexual  abuse  and  violence  is  that  it
destroys the character and  the  personality  of  these  kids.  I  lived  in
Ireland, for example, where I headed a commission  of  inquiry,  and  people
came to me privately because I  was  a  foreigner,  and  told  me  what  had
happened to them in schools and why they became  nuns  -  because  they  had
been violated in schools. Their relationship with other people had  changed,
and I think we must take into account what happens to the victims of  sexual
abuse, so the right to innocence must be protected.
What follows from there is: Those who violate the right  to  innocence  must
be condemned to punishment, and I can tell you now  that  in  the  past  two
years the South African Council of Educators, acting much quicker  than  the
provinces or the prosecuting  authorities,  has  been  dismissing  offenders
from the register. Once they are dismissed  from  the  register  they  can't
teach. Unlike  doctors  who  can  come  back  to  reregister,  there  is  no
provision for reregistering. That is the first point. The  second  point  is
that when there is a prima facie case like a serious allegation, the  people
concerned must be suspended immediately although there is a  presumption  of
innocence. However, if there is a serious  allegation  made,  and  there  is
invariably a prima facie case, there must be a suspension,  as  happened  in
the Western Cape, without violating anyone's constitutional rights.

I end by  saying  therefore  that  these  rights  are  very  important.  One
newspaper has accused  me  of  being  more  considerate  of  the  children's
freedoms. It is not that. If we behave like a  permanent  police  state,  as
was the case before 1994, then everybody is presumed to be guilty. If  there
are reasonable grounds for believing that, in fact, a teacher  has  violated
or students have violated the  rights  of  others,  particularly  abuse,  or
there are reasonable grounds for believing that a child has a gun, then  the
law provides one to  be  searched  and  arrested.  However,  there  must  be
reasonable grounds, otherwise  we  tear  up  the  constitutional  and  legal
order, which I think is falling into the trap the  vigilantes  are  creating
for us. [Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 27 - Communications:

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Madam Speaker, Deputy President,  colleagues
in the executive, hon members of this House  and  distinguished  guests,  we
meet here at the end of a month that marked the sad passing  away  of  Ntate
Walter Sisulu from our midst, a hero of our people  and  a  freedom  fighter
who all through his life  worked  tirelessly  and  selflessly  to  make  our
country great, and who nearly ten years  ago,  paying  tribute  to  our  new
democracy, said:


  It was a remarkable moment I can never forget, a situation I am unable to
  describe properly, where the masses gave us all leadership in an  amazing
  way.

We too must never forget that moment. We cannot betray the trust the  masses
placed in this leadership.

This week we celebrated the 40th anniversary of  the  OAU,  now  called  the
African Union, an organisation that contributed greatly to  the  achievement
of our democracy. Now, nine years into our democracy, as I rise  to  present
this budget speech, the masses of our people are  armed  with  determination
to work hard in united action to bring about  transformation  and  sustained
development. The South African democracy continues to be  strengthened.  The
Government of this country knows where it is going and where we  come  from,
and we have no intention of  going  back  there.  In  partnership  with  the
people, we are driven by a  commitment  to  democracy  and  are  engaged  in
collective efforts to push back the frontiers of poverty and  expand  access
to a  better  life.  Our  challenge  is  to  do  this  in  and  through  the
Information Communication Technology, or ICT, sector.

The President has said that the tide has turned, and our  task  is  to  take
this tide at the flood so as to make social and economic  progress.  In  our
sector the tide has indeed turned. The recent past that saw the fall of dot-
coms and the slump in the telecoms industry is receding. It is in this  vein
that we speak about greater hope for  using  ICTs  to  expedite  social  and
economic development and to change people's lives.

Yet, in recent months the world has not been  at  peace.  We  have  recently
seen the use of ICTs, not for creative purposes or for  social  development,
but for the purpose of destruction. A moment-by-moment account  of  loss  of
lives and destruction was relayed to all corners of the  world  through  the
utilisation of ICTs about a war we did not want,  but  could  not  stop,  in
Iraq.  As  South  Africans,  we  believe  in  building  relations  of  human
solidarity.

Nine years ago most of our people could not imagine a world where anyone  in
a village or small town could access information about the history  of  that
community through the push of a button and in the  languages  spoken  within
that community. Nobody could imagine a world where  we  would  not  have  to
queue for access to basic government services and where we would be able  to
access these services at one point. Nobody could imagine a  world  where  e-
learning flourishes so that those who are far from centres of  learning  can
have access to the same information  as  those  who  are  located  near  the
educational institutions. Today, our people can imagine this and many  often
already experience it.

Today you can imagine a situation where access to telemedicine  can  improve
the health of thousands  of  our  people.  Contemplate  a  world  where  new
entrepreneurs in rural areas emerge, where new SMMEs generate more  interest
in their products and services through  expanding  market  access  by  using
Public Information  Terminals  in  their  neighbourhoods,  and  where  rural
electronic banking will be possible. Today we can  imagine  a  South  Africa
where our youth run community media projects and  make  use  of  development
communications, especially community  radio,  to  create  national  networks
that help to bring all together to strengthen democracy and  participate  at
local level, inculcating a new consciousness of change.

This imagined world is not a far-fetched idea, but one that is beginning  to
happen. As we embrace these new technologies and meet our  policy,  as  well
as our legislative and regulatory challenges, we are beginning to  transform
our society.

In May 2002 I delivered the budget of my department. We undertook,  together
with our  portfolio  organisations  and  other  Government  departments,  to
broaden access to a better life. I am proud to say that  my  department  has
worked hard to succeed in accomplishing  this.  On  the  legislative  front,
electronic communications and transactions are  now  written  into  law.  As
required by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, a  selection
panel to appoint the Domain Name Authority Board is in place and  more  than
130 nominations for the board were received. It was, indeed,  representative
nomination. Secondly, the cyber inspectorate is now up  and  running  and  a
trust centre is operational and is located in a safe harbour.

With regard to the 112 emergency services,  the  pilot  project  started  in
Klerksdorp has now been completed.  The  112  services  will  allow  safety,
security and emergency services to be connected to the public in  real  time
and to be deployed effectively to where they are needed through a  dedicated
national network. Lessons learned from the pilot will  inform  the  roll-out
process throughout the country.

 The  Broadcasting  Amendment  Act  provides  for  the  launch  of  regional
television stations in two regions of the country. To this end it  has  been
decided to close down the Bop broadcasting operation and replace it  with  a
service to deliver indigenous languages to the northern region and,  perhaps
later, in another kind of  service  to  the  southern  areas,  in  this  way
bringing some kind of equality to languages in our country.

The  SABC  has  developed  its  editorial  policies  for  news   and   other
programming that  cover,  amongst  other  things,  the  issues  of  content,
accuracy and impartiality which are now open  for  public  comment.  I  hope
that the public will comment, as I hear it commenting sometimes.

Last year we said that Government would  launch  a  dedicated  parliamentary
service. This has been thoroughly researched and investigated,  and  it  has
become clear that both a television and radio service of  a  broader  nature
is required. Having taken cognisance  of  this,  we  will  be  launching  an
interactive information service that will give the public access  to  events
both nationally and at provincial level. It is envisaged  that  the  initial
channel of delivery will be through radio satellite  link-ups.  This  matter
is now before Cabinet.

We had planned to  have  a  Convergence  Bill  before  Parliament.  However,
because of international developments, a depressed global telecoms  industry
and the need for  broader  international  consultation,  we  embarked  on  a
feasibility study to  develop  a  policy  framework  for  dealing  with  the
complexities of convergence.  This  will  now  be  followed  by  a  national
colloquium this year, preceded  by  regional  campaigns.  We  are,  however,
still targeting the  end  of  the  year  to  table  this  Bill,  which  will
revolutionise the sector, before Parliament.

The amendment to the Postal Services Act has  strengthened  the  mandate  of
the Postal Regulator by separating policy from regulation, resulting in  the
appointment  of  the  Chairperson  of  the  Regulator  who   has   extensive
experience in the industry. I believe he will be an  asset  in  leading  the
Postal Regulator as an independent monitor of ongoing  developments  in  the
industry.

Regarding our budget for 2003, in our national effort to  eradicate  poverty
and to transform our country  into  a  just  and  prosperous  one,  we  also
champion the  People's  Contract  for  a  Better  Tomorrow.  It  is  in  the
interests of the  people  that  we  wish  to  broaden  access  to  services,
stimulate economic growth, focus on human resource  development  and  create
the conditions for a better life and safer  South  Africa  and  for  greater
efficiency in delivery. To do this, we need wider access to services.

The Telecommunications Act provides for the 1800MHz spectrum  to  be  issued
to existing operators, the SNO  and  Underserviced  Area  Operators.  A  key
element in this process is the determination of access  fees  and  universal
service obligations for the allocation of the frequency  spectrum.  We  were
able to negotiate the above,  including  new  service  fees  and  additional
universal obligations, with the industry. Together with us  they  have  made
certain proposals regarding obligations, amongst others a supply of 250  000
free telephones and numbers to public emergency services over a period of  5
years; the provision of Internet and telephone links,  including  computers,
at schools - I hope Minister Kader Asmal is listening; public pay phones  in
accessible places in rural areas and multipurpose community centres,  and  4
million free SIM cards to be issued over a 5-year-period.

In line with Government's co-ordinated  working  method,  these  obligations
are to  be  delivered  on  the  basis  of  a  framework  decided  on  by  an
interdepartmental team composed of  the  Departments  of  Communication,  of
Health, of Education, of Local Government and of Social Welfare, as well  as
the National Treasury, the SAPS, the SA Post Office and operators.

In the postal sector, the tide has indeed turned and  implementation  is  on
track. Considerable progress has been made  operationally  by  the  SA  Post
Office since last we reported to this House,  with  many  cost  efficiencies
having been implemented. During the past two years the SA  Post  Office  has
made a significant breakthrough in the fight against crime  and  corruption.
It did not come as a surprise,  therefore,  that  the  SA  Post  Office  was
nominated  into  the  top  five  most  secure  mail  services   during   the
International Mail Awards held in Rome two weeks ago.  We  congratulate  the
CEO and officials for making us proudly South African. [Applause.]

Of course, the SA Post Office faces tremendous challenges  as  a  result  of
new technologies. However, we will make  efforts  to  make  sure  that  post
offices throughout the country get connected through  focusing  on  PITs  in
rural areas  and  thus  contributing  to  Government's  goal  of  integrated
sustainable rural development.

Through the Northwest's social development department, and along  with  Post
Bank officials, our department has also started a pilot project  which  will
encourage senior citizens to use  the  bank  in  accessing  their  pensions,
thereby encouraging them to save with the  bank.  A  secure  and  integrated
solution has been developed to make sure that there is security.

The SA Post Office also has a role to play in  capturing  our  heritage.  It
usually does so through the issuing of stamps. In  memory  of  some  of  the
best sons of our land, the SA  Post  Office  has  decided  to  remember  our
heroes by designing an everlasting commemorative stamp of Chris Hani  and  O
R Tambo. [Applause.] I am glad to make this announcement in the presence  of
Mama Tambo in the gallery. Siyabonga [Thank you] Post Office, on  behalf  of
Mama. Thank you, Mama. [Applause.]

In the broadcasting sector, more South African families  today  have  access
to information and education through television and  radio.  Almost  48%  of
rural households have TV sets, compared  to  27%  in  1994.  Radio  is  also
accessible via public, commercial and community radio, and 88% of the  rural
population now listens to the radio over a 7-day-period, compared to 79%  in
1994. Many people still say that we do not improve the lives of our  people.
These statistics speak for themselves.

The department is planning the SA Broadcast  Content  and  Languages  Summit
which is to be held so that we  can  draw  the  policy  makers,  regulators,
operators, broadcast content producers and civil society to  look  into  the
state of South African broadcasting.

This event will take place in September to enable delegates  to  assess  the
state of the South African broadcasting system,  the  services  it  provides
against the backdrop of public needs and to look into the future  of  public
broadcasting in South Africa,  with  a  focus  on  content  development  and
provision.

A growing economy that expands economic opportunities is important for  this
country.  Managed  liberalisation  of  the  telecommunications  sector   is,
therefore, important, and it has meant that we  have  to  make  careful  and
flexible decisions about what is to be done, create workable plans and  find
solutions for problems that exist. This was done in the case of  the  Second
National Operator, as well as the Telkom IPO.

You will recall that last year we issued an ITA  for  a  51%  stake  in  the
Second National Operator. Two applications  were  received  from  consortia,
but Icasa recommended that neither of them were in a  position  to  take  up
this equity. I concurred with the recommendation and set about preparing  an
alternative process that would facilitate a way forward and, accordingly,  I
applied section 35(a) of the Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  as  amended,
which provided for the Minister  in  specific  instances  to  determine  the
manner in  which  applications  may  be  made,  the  licensing  process  and
conditions that will apply.

Thus, on 31 March this year, I issued a new invitation to  express  interest
to apply for the stake of 51%. The process was  conducted  in  four  phases.
The Second National Operator Committee that I  set  up  has  considered  all
expressions  of  interest.  It  has  now  conducted  all  negotiations,  and
yesterday  I  received  the  committee's  recommendation  which  I  will  be
considering for later processing by Icasa. I expect that the license  should
be issued in the third quarter of this year and that the  new  player  ought
to be in operation soon thereafter.

Last year we announced the end of exclusivity for Telkom, and in March  this
year, as a result of the co-ordinated work  of  the  Departments  of  Public
Enterprises and Communications, Telkom and Icasa,  Telkom  has  successfully
listed on the Johannesburg  Securities  Exchange  and  the  New  York  Stock
Exchange. This was an  important  milestone  in  Government's  programme  to
liberalise the telecommunications sector. I wish to assure the industry  and
consumers that Government is committed to the introduction of a  strong  and
vibrant future ICT sector.

With regard to Sentech, Sentech received its  multimedia  and  international
gateway licenses in May last year. Its international gateway is  operational
and the company has already signed up with a mobile operator.  It  commenced
work with a  phased  roll-out  of  its  multimedia  network  which  will  be
offering a select number of  products.  This  multimedia  business  will  be
launched before the end of the year.

With regard to areas that are underserviced and in which we  have  to  issue
licenses, the department has had  regional  road  shows  to  facilitate  the
implementation of the legislation which  provides  for  these  licenses.  An
invitation to apply was issued for the first phase of the licensing  in  the
following provinces: Limpopo, Eastern Cape, Free  State,  KwaZulu-Natal  and
the North West, and the closing date is 30 June 2003.

With regard to the Universal Service Agency, in accordance with the  Act  we
have appointed a  new  board,  as  well  as  a  new  chief  executive.  This
contributed to the changing of the stature of the organisation.  A  business
plan has been developed to reposition the agency and redefine its  corporate
identity and, indeed, the tide has turned.

When we say that the tide is turning, we see evidence  of  it,  particularly
in the human resource development area and in how we  are  working  together
with the Government, with civil society and our parastatals and  communities
in accelerating the training of our young people and transferring skills.

The  valuable  work  done  by  the  Institute  for  Satellite  and  Software
Applications and the National Electronic Media Institute  of  South  Africa,
Nemisa, is based on the understanding that as Africans, we  need  to  assert
our ownership and control over the production, management and  dissemination
of knowledge. It is part of  reclaiming  our  dignity  and  self-worth,  our
desire to reclaim our African identity as scientists,  as  well  as  meeting
the needs of the present with confidence. We should find  the  solutions  to
problems that are ours and emerge victorious in the future.

The Institute for Satellite and Software Applications has continued to  work
in satellite development and remote  sensing,  telecommunications,  software
and network engineering. It has now changed from being  a  primary  academic
training institute and more to being one for product  development.  Some  of
their projects include a satellite development  group  that  is  building  a
microsatellite that can scan water  and  electricity  meters,  reading  them
from above, saving municipalities millions  in  both  time  and  money,  and
providing services to all of us who pay with a much more  reliable  account.
I hope all of us will actually applaud this move  by  the  young  people  of
Issa. [Applause.]

They also have a project on computer virus monitoring, where they  know  and
can tell you very early what virus might attack your computer. They have  an
electronic testing facility that enables industry to test  products  locally
instead of in foreign laboratories.  Some  of  the  graduates  have  already
patented their inventions, and they are sitting in the House  above  us  and
in front of us there. We want to congratulate them. [Applause.]

Nemisa is strengthening our democracy and, in doing so,  we  recognise  that
it  is  important  that  on  full  use  and  sustained  development  of  our
languages, they gather to contribute to a vibrant South African culture  and
identity. Nemisa's work,  through  developing  web-based  language  portals,
takes us further along the road to language equality and  is  proof  of  how
ICTs can be used to assert the rights of people.

Nemisa, which is made up of many young people,  has  undergone  a  strategic
shift from traditional broadcasting training to a fully  fledged  multimedia
training institute. Learners have received intensive hands-on experience  to
develop indigenous language-based portals. The portals are  to  be  used  to
record the history of various languages and communities.  That  way  we  can
indeed reclaim our languages and our history. This  year,  65  graduates  in
radio and television and production  will  actually  graduate  from  Nemisa.
Some of them have already been placed with industry.

The programme for the Advanced Institute for ICTs is on  track.  A  business
plan for the institute has been finalised by the  management  team,  working
with various departments, and this  plan  will  soon  be  submitted  to  the
committee of Ministers for discussion in Cabinet.
Regarding black economic empowerment, my department has already aligned  its
procurement policies with national black  economic  empowerment  objectives.
Our portfolio organisations have also  paid  major  attention  to  this.  In
structuring the SNO, we set aside 19% to BEEs. Our broadcasting  legislation
has also included BEE quotas. Guided by the BEE Mining Charter and the  work
done by the Department of Minerals and Energy and the  Department  of  Trade
and Industry, we are in a consultative process to decide if we  need  a  BEE
charter for the ICT sector. The department  has  also  undertaken  a  sector
ownership survey of the industries  in  our  sector.  This  study  has  been
described by industry  players  as  the  most  comprehensive  audit  of  BEE
players in these industries to date.

I would like to share a human experience with you. I  would  like  to  share
with you the experience of the community of Westbury  in  Johannesburg,  and
how they have come together to change their lives.  Westbury  has  a  tragic
history of gang  violence.  It  took  the  genuine  care  and  ingenuity  of
community leaders, especially through the  efforts  of  people  like  Joseph
Cottey, who is also sitting in the gallery, Don Mattera and many others,  to
bring the warring youth together through the establishment of  the  Westbury
Community Development Centre which introduced the use of  ICTs.  [Applause.]
The results have surpassed all expectations.

Members of this previously distressed community acted in concert to  reclaim
their community, to restore their dignity and to  take  their  destiny  into
their own  hands.  Youth  were  taught  computer  literacy,  television  and
production skills, and some have prospered on to careers such as  production
managers, producers, as well as directors. The community has also built  its
own outside broadcasting van. Members have seen the big  OB  vans  that  the
SABC has? They have built their own one, and they have also  built  a  basic
radio studio and even established technical partnerships  with  Sentech  and
Multichoice to further their development.

We thank them for this work that they have done and  for  the  support  that
our organisations have gained. We thank the SABC for  taking  eight  out  of
nine of these trained youngsters, because their work was so good.  I'd  like
to pay tribute to mentors such as Joseph Cottey and  some  of  the  Westbury
group who are here today, as I said, for the work that  they  have  done  as
true community builders and for making a difference. [Applause.]

As part of our contribution to a better Africa and a better  world,  we  are
supporting the work of the Nepad ICT task  force,  the  e-Africa  Commission
that was established to formulate action programmes and projects  to  bridge
the digital divide. Our efforts were further encouraged in  Abuja  in  March
this year, when the Nepad  Heads  of  State  and  Government  Implementation
Committee commended the e-Africa Commission for its work and called for  the
immediate implementation  of  its  ICT  projects,  including  the  e-Schools
project, the e-readiness  study  and  the  development  of  the  East  Coast
submarine cables in which Telkom is also  involved.  We  are  now  grappling
with how to link the  landlocked  countries,  so  as  to  make  the  African
Renaissance a reality.
The Digital Partnership South Africa Project, a  public-private  partnership
established  in  collaboration  with  the  Prince  of  Wales   International
Business  Leaders  Forum,  acquires  used   computers   from   multinational
organisations, gets them refurbished and deployed in schools countrywide.  A
refurbishment factory at Issa, our institute,  is  run  by  15  women.  This
financial year,  we  will  receive  67  000  computers.  Together  with  the
Department of Education and the Universal Service Agency, we  are  preparing
a roll-out to all schools in the country.

The world of new technologies has also meant the arrival  of  new  languages
in the form of SMSs and a new  shorthand.  People  are  communicating  more,
quicker and better, and the  new  applications  are  revolutionising  social
behaviour. Soon MMSs, multimedia short messages, will come into  common  use
and we will be able to see the person we are talking to on the  other  side.
Soon we'll be able to know exactly where people are calling  from  and  this
will contribute to bringing about greater security and  community  cohesion.
What it, of course, will do is that Mr Kader Asmal  will  know  whether  his
granddaughter is phoning exactly from where she  says  she  is.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.] However, of  course,  this  has  implications  for  those  young
married men who might be telling other kinds of  stories.  Your  wives  will
know where you are calling from! [Laughter.]

Technological evolution and policy intervention has made this  possible.  In
the forthcoming year, we will revolutionise the role of the Post Office.  We
will create a policy  framework  for  conversions  that  will  lead  to  new
services. We'll  deliver  indigenous  languages  in  regional  broadcasting.
We'll develop more local content. We will  inculcate  a  culture  of  saving
amongst young people and help to create a safe haven.

I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my management  team,  the  entire
staff, as well as my  advisers  in  the  department  for  their  hard  work,
particularly the sterling leadership of the director. My special  thanks  go
to the outgoing Chairperson  of  the  Communications  Portfolio,  Mr  Nkenke
Kekana, and all members of the committee for  their  unflinching  commitment
to realising the vision of the department. [Applause.]

Our loss of a chairperson who not only knew the sector well and  continually
kept abreast of developments, but also gave leadership to the  committee  in
a manner that was most inclusive and avoided undue  contestation  on  issues
that we needed to tackle as South Africans interested  in  our  country  and
its prosperity is, however, a gain  to  the  industry.  We  wish  you  well,
comrade.

Hon members, I wish to invite you to help us in our endeavours by voting  to
approve the budget for this financial year. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M K LEKGORO: Madam Deputy Speaker, the significance  of  the  information
age is that it has created information societies, societies that depend  for
their economic  survival  on  the  immediate  access  to  large  amounts  of
information on a global scale. It is in this context that  communication  in
our country has become a sphere of academic persuasion,  lucrative  business
and an area that Government regulates. In our time the most  contested  area
of communication is mass media  and  how  to  disseminate  information  with
speed.

The ANC resolved in its recent  national  conference  in  Stellenbosch  that
media and communications are contested terrains and therefore  not  neutral,
but reflect the ideological battles and power relations on race,  class  and
gender in our society.

The conference further resolved  that  the  public  broadcaster,  the  SABC,
plays a critical role in shaping  opinions  and  building  societal  values,
including the moral fibre of our society, socioeconomic  transformation  and
the building of a united, patriotic nation.

It is against this background that we should celebrate the  achievements  of
our Government on the communications front since 1994. We turned  around  an
institution that was used for selfish ends and returned it  to  the  people.
Our legislative and regulatory framework has turned the SABC into  a  public
broadcaster that gives a South African expression.

We watched with dismay the role broadcasters could play  with  the  invasion
of Iraq by American and British troops. This was  a  clear  illustration  of
how a broadcaster can simply be turned into a weapon of war.

It is our fervent belief that never again will the SABC be used by those  in
power as a weapon of war and propaganda. Never again will it be  a  tool  to
misinform, brainwash and control people. In this regard, our Government  has
turned the  tide  and  positioned  our  public  broadcaster  as  a  reliable
informer, educator and entertainer. We also welcome  the  latest  initiative
by the SABC in issuing their  draft  editorial  policy  to  the  public  for
comment.

During our interaction with the SABC and in other public fora, the  ANC  has
consistently raised the issue of language  on  the  public  broadcaster.  We
have repeatedly made the  point  that  language  is  a  very  important  and
emotional issue, especially in a country with diverse language  groups  such
as ours. It impacts on the dignity of people and their sense  of  belonging.
Language is a tool of building a  united  and  patriotic  nation.  A  public
broadcaster as a mirror of our society is obliged to  reflect  people's  way
of life, their cultures and their beliefs in their own languages.

It was with this in mind that we accepted the Government's proposal that  we
provide in law for two regional stations  which  will  further  enhance  the
capacity of the public broadcaster to attend to the issue of  languages.  In
our future interactions with the SABC we will take up this matter  with  the
seriousness it deserves. These stations must be on air sooner.

Similarly, we will have to pay attention to our community of the deaf.  Deaf
SA, an organisation of the deaf in our  country,  say  from  their  research
that there are four million deaf people in  the  country.  The  ANC  at  its
national conference resolved that the public broadcaster  must  ensure  that
its television programmes have close captioning,  sign  language  and  other
means to cater for the deaf.

This is the same demand that Deaf SA  put  before  our  portfolio  committee
during the course of last year. We will continue to engage with the SABC  on
how best and how soon the deaf of our country can realise this dream.

We welcome the fact that the Government  under  the  Media  Development  and
Diversity Agency Act, has now established and funded the board. One  of  the
central tasks of the board is to encourage ownership  and  control  of,  and
access to media by historically disadvantaged communities,  as  well  as  by
historically diminished indigenous languages and cultural groups.

The work of this board, if well  executed,  will  be  another  milestone  in
urban and rural development. This will enhance the capability of  Government
to take information either in electronic or print form to areas  that  could
otherwise not be reached by any media.
Introduction and growth of media in South Africa will deepen  democracy  and
encourage the  participation  of  people  in  the  democratic  life  of  the
country, and hence enable people to become their own liberators.

Icasa remains a clear signpost of how far we as  a  country  have  come  and
gone in introducing regulatory stability. Today  we  have  a  clear,  legal,
regulatory environment. Investors in  the  media  and  communication  sector
enjoy a predictable environment. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, we  can
confidently say the  merger  between  IBA  and  SATRA  has  paid  dividends.
Difficult and enormous as the work before Icasa might be, we  are  confident
that the regulator is capable of addressing the  concerns  of  industry  and
the public.

What Government must determine is the correct funding model  for  Icasa.  We
need to determine accurately, both in human and  financial  resources,  what
we require to build a capable and independent regulator.

Industry players  who  have  huge  resources  continuously  undermine  Icasa
through litigation. This eats into the already inadequate resources  of  the
regulator. Government must definitely examine this  situation  and  consider
funding legal fees of the regulator directly from the fiscus.

Madam Speaker, for some time now, our  portfolio  committee  has  interacted
with the advertising industry. These are companies that advertise a  product
in order to lure consumers into buying it. They do  this  through  political
messages, culture and use of our belief systems to get at the consumer.  How
we look at advertising and whether we  agree  with  how  it  is  done  is  a
philosophical question.

What we know is that this is a big money-spinning  industry.  It  needs  the
majority of our people, who happen to be black and  African  in  particular,
to enrich the owners of capital. The content of  these  ads  must  be  South
African and promote proudly South African products.

We expect the industry in the next three years to transform  at  equity  and
decision-making levels and also employ people  mainly  from  the  previously
disadvantaged communities. It must be a world-class industry  that  is  able
to reflect our South Africanness.

It pleases us to report that in our opinion the  industry  agrees  with  our
point of view. They have since adopted a ``value statement of the  marketing
and communication industry''. We view this statement as a step in the  right
direction. However, there is an English idiom that says the ``proof  of  the
pudding is in the eating''. It is our sincere hope that  in  our  continuous
interaction with the industry,  they  will  demonstrate  to  us  that  self-
regulation works without any legal intervention.

On signal distribution, Parliament gave Sentech an  opportunity  to  deliver
services through a multimedia  licence.  The  Telecom  Act  2001  has  given
Sentech an international gateway.  These  licences  have  given  Sentech  an
enabling environment to roll out  services  beyond  its  traditional  signal
distribution.  We  are  encouraged  that  Sentech   is   already   switching
telecommunications traffic between South Africa and other countries.

We expect that Sentech should use its multimedia  licence  to  roll  out  to
South  Africans  tele-education  and  telemedicine  services.   Telemedicine
services in particular will enable rural  communities  to  access  the  best
medical advice from well-resourced areas.

Last year there was a great deal of excitement around the  country  when  we
were processing the Electronic Communication Transactions Act. What  we  had
intended  was  the  development  of  the  information  economy  for   social
prosperity, and it is  essential  that  we  remove  barriers  to  electronic
communication and transaction in the Republic. We  also  intend  to  provide
legal certainty and confidence in the sector.

However, we in the  ANC  believe  that  universal  service,  mainly  to  the
underserviced areas of our country, is paramount. It is therefore  important
that we speed up the setting of the .za domain  name  authority  for  it  to
resume  responsibility  from  the  incumbent.  We  can  only   insist   that
Government does everything possible to ensure success in this regard.

I see my time is almost up, Madam Speaker. Let me see where to  go  now  ...
[Laughter.] I still have a ... Yes, but Madam Speaker, maybe  I  should  end
here and say in conclusion that I would like to wish  Comrade  Ned  well  in
his new area of work, and  to  say  that  his  knowledge  and  diligence  in
communication work was our source of strength. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Deputy Speaker, although we  will  pay  tribute  to  Rudi  Heine
later, allow me to say simply that he was a most beloved colleague - one  of
nature's gentlemen  -  and  that  we  will  miss  him  personally  and  also
professionally. He was the spokesperson for us on public enterprises,  which
is a field related to communications in these days.

Madam, the hon the Minister has been, in my view, fortunate  in  the  degree
of acceptance which has met her proactive  personal  quest  for  a  majority
stakeholder in the Second National Operator, or SNO, which I believe has  to
be one of the two really burning issues we need to deal with  -  competition
to Telkom and then an overall policy.

So desperate is the need for competition  to  Telkom  that  only  relatively
muted criticism has surrounded the attempt to find a partner at  any  price.
However, we do ask the  question:  What  will  that  price  be?  Shareholder
agreements concluded behind closed doors have not  served  us  well  in  the
past, and we do ask ourselves, Minister, how much  hope  there  is  of  true
competition, rather than collusion, when  the  competitive  negotiation  has
occurred between bidders and the Government, which is  after  all  a  golden
shareholder in Telkom and a 30% stakeholder in the SNO.  The  SNO  licensing
process belongs with Icasa which recently followed the DA  in  objecting  to
the department's initial intention of usurping its licensing role  outright.
Icasa stood its ground and  kept  its  integrity.  We  note  the  Minister's
progress reported today, and we must suspend judgment on the  process  until
much later when Icasa has spoken.

Our greater concern, however, is that this exercise has not been  so  kindly
construed abroad. It has been called ``just another slap in the face of  the
regulator''. I believe, incidentally, the hon Lekgoro was correct  today  in
setting the position, the health and the funding of  the  regulator  as  the
barometer for how well we're doing with liberalisation. I  agree  with  many
of his analyses of the problems, not necessarily with all the answers.

The decade of liberation in  South  Africa  has  of  course  coincided  with
liberalisation. We have systematically, over these 10  years,  been  setting
up an independent, transparent, nondiscriminatory licensing  and  regulatory
regime in the hands of the regulator.  Why?  To  create  a  fair  and  level
playing field for competition in which Ministers, like  the  old  Posts  and
Telegraphs, no longer run any natural or unnatural monopolies  or  any  kind
of empire. And that process - I remind  hon  members  -  began  in  1993  at
Kempton Park. Now, in 2003, it seems to me there is a danger  that  we  have
come full circle when Gartner Dataquest in an investment  advisory,  bluntly
advises telecom operators to ``work with the Department  of  Communications,
rather than the regulator, as  the  former  is  clearly  -  for  now  -  the
executive of telecom policy in the country''. When Gartner sounds a  warning
that stable legislative  and  operational  frameworks  are  unlikely  to  be
available during 2003,  that  means  in  ordinary  English  that  the  South
African Government has been acting arbitrarily,  ignoring  the  law  of  the
land, which is of course what  we  have  charged  also  in  the  context  of
broadcasting when the hon Minister wanted to approve SABC policies.

 The Department of Communications should have been  preparing  South  Africa
for digitisation and the framework issue, instead of concerning itself  with
content. We don't see why Esitel and Transtel couldn't have found their  own
equity partners for the SNO. Instead, that search is where executive  energy
has gone.
I think, Madam, that the Department of Communications itself  realises  that
we have reached something of a crisis point. Ten days after we released  the
DA's communications policy, the department announced a  policy  overhaul  in
line with our proposals on  technological  neutrality  ...  [Interjections.]
No, no, wait ... and the separate regulation of transmission and content  in
the age of convergence. Now, if we helped to force  the  department's  hand,
that is some reward for the long hours of work that we put into this  policy
field that so fascinates us. Likewise, I know it  also  fascinates  the  hon
Minister. The Director-General has told me that he has read  my  paper,  and
that he does not disagree much. I think that is  good  news,  so  leave  the
catcalling. I think that's good news. If  we  helped,  that  makes  me  very
happy.

Technology runs  ahead  of  any  law  that  tries  to  restrict  innovation.
Sentech's decision to build  an  Internet  protocol-based  architecture  for
wireless broadband means that millions of South Africans will soon  be  more
inclined  to  make  their  voice-calls  over  their  computers  than   their
telephones, notwithstanding the law, and  no-one  is  going  to  stop  them,
because nobody can police them. Sentech  gets  our  prize  for  pushing  the
present regulatory envelope.

Technology also runs ahead of public policy, and I think we  have  now  seen
it proved that the roll-out of old-fashioned  wires  was  overtaken  by  the
private sector. More people have  cellphones  in  South  Africa  than  fixed
phones. It is therefore  quite  clear  that  we  are  looking  at  a  policy
failure, and it seems to me from what the Minister has announced today  that
she recognises that. She is handing out four million more SIM cards, and  we
have the promise of a convergence colloquium. I  think  the  recognition  is
there that the private sector has  in  fact  been  providing  the  universal
service which Government policy has been based on in the name of  the  poor.
The poor in South Africa today have pre-paid. They are all  mobile,  as  far
as cellphones are concerned, if not yet upwardly  mobile  because  of  other
economic factors. However, it seems to me that Government  is  beginning  to
look in the right direction and we greatly welcome that, and  we  warn  only
that the policy overhaul must be genuinely fundamental and  cannot  rest  on
control  of  all  of  the  operators  by  Government,  whether  as  a  part-
shareholder, indirectly or directly.

Mr F T MASERUMULE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I have not known Ms Smuts  for
a long time, but because I have learnt that she is of my age, I  can  safely
say I am going to enjoy this confrontation. She is a very  good  politician,
but sometimes she becomes very careless with her ideas because  she  forgets
that the very same constituency she is talking to is so exhausted  with  the
ideas they are expressing on a daily basis.

Beside that point, the ANC wants to comment on a more serious note,  on  the
death of hon Rudi Heine. Re apantisa [our deepest condolences]  to  the  DA.
Death is death. It does not know colour, age, size and  shape;  it  is  just
death. [Interjections]

I was also not born a British citizen, by the way. My speech today is  going
to focus on postal services, but I am also going to dedicate  my  speech  to
Comrade Elias Motswaledi who used to be a good  storyteller.  The  theme  is
river culture today. Amongst other things, if he was  here,  he  would  have
loved to say to us

``šikiša dira le molapo mphago wa dira ke meetse, Nka se re  ke  re  kgwathi
wa palelwa ke go re kgwankgwa''] [idiom]. I hope  [Ke  tshepa  gore]  ba  ga
Mohlala are here [ba mo], ka sepedi sa ga Sekhukhuni ba re mohlala wa  kgomo
ga o gwame go swana le eveready battery [idiom]. Kgomo ba re  ge  e  eya  go
robala ga e apole sporty because ga e na sona. Le gona ga e role  dieta,  ga
e apole underwear because ga e na yona go swana le ge  e  tsoga  ga  e  dire
dilo tVeo because ga e na tšona. It is an eveready  battery,  it  is  always
ready to communicate. Mohlala wa kgomo ga o gwame [idiom].  (Translation  of
Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[It is said that when a cow goes to sleep, it does not take off  its  sporty
because it does not have one.  It  does  not  take  off  its  shoes  or  its
underwear, because it does not have them. The same  applies  when  it  wakes
up.]
Flowing from the state of the  nation  address  by  the  President,  Comrade
Thabo Mbeki, if Comrade Elias Motswaledi was here amongst us, he would  have
said that - I remember this from a book  co-written  by  him,  Mlangeni  and
somebody else, the three of them; the book's name is The  Sun  Will  Rise  -
indeed, against all odds, the South African sun has risen and because it  is
the real South African sun that is rising, we are  beginning  to  hear  real
drums of real South African  gods.  We  are  now  seeing  real  rains,  real
summers and real winters because the South African sun has risen.

If I were nearer to the base, I would say  the  real  struggle  for  a  real
better life for all of us has just begun. In spite of new challenges  ahead,
we can look back with some measure of pride, and,  because  our  nine  years
experience is on the wall for everybody to see,  we  can  encouragingly  and
continuously remain hopeful that with the new  vigour,  energy,  vision  and
new ideas, we can with conviction and in unison prepare  ourselves  for  the
last long extra mile.

Those who  are  like  me,  who  are  rural  in  nature  and  character  will
understand how paramountly important it is for the mere existence of a  post
office. We are not talking here about a building which is built  in  marble,
but a mere structure where we can go and collect our  letters  and  buy  our
stamps on a daily  basis.  For  us  in  the  rural  areas,  it  is  a  great
achievement  to  have  such  a  small  structure.  Indeed,  it  is  of  such
significance that like any other institution  that  deals  with  educational
matters, the post office can contribute to the improvement  of  the  culture
of writing, reading and learning too.

If I were to quote from Matefu, Comrade O R, not  verbatim,  he  would  have
said `` Nothing can ever be powerful like a written word''. If one wants  to
observe how fast communication has become these days  as  a  result  of  the
development of technology, one  may  as  well  watch  an  ostrich  when  her
privacy is being violated by a raging veld fire, and see how  quick  it  can
be in extinguishing the fire. Even if we were to listen to his teaching,  he
would have taken it further and said that revolutionaries who  would  prefer
to put their ear to the ground all the time to listen to  the  masses,  must
always  listen  to  their   heartbeats   because,   by   virtue   of   being
revolutionaries, they are part and parcel of the very masses themselves.

Comrade Minister, I just want to take one little example from the  types  of
things one sees in the media and takes for  granted  sometimes.  Here  is  a
very fascinating story from Stellenbosch. Mr Dave Dalling, who is  a  former
member of this House, I believe, paid a visit  to  a  very  poor  and  small
dorpie outside Stellenbosch, at a place  called  Kayamandi  which  does  not
have anything  to  link  it  with  the  world  in  terms  of  communication.
Currently, Mr Dave Dalling is heading a trust called Bridge  The  Trust.  He
quickly linked with Mr Manyatshe, the  CEO  of  the  Post  Office,  and  the
results will be witnessed by all of us.

I want to make an appeal, Comrade Minister. I personally undertook  a  visit
to King Williamstown the other time. I went around to the post office.  Some
of our post offices are not very dirty; but they are not tidy. They need  to
be centres of delivery which people can be attracted to.

I also want to congratulate the responsibility that Mr Manyatshe  took  upon
himself to try and deal with the reduction of the levels  of  corruption  in
the postal services. Sometimes when you are brave  enough,  especially  when
you are looking for the truth, you sometimes take a stick.  We  congratulate
you, your team and your colleagues. [Applause.]

Finally, I want to appeal to Comrade Minister that if the budget does  allow
us to do so this year, in the next six months if possible,  we  should  look
into whether we might not be able to upgrade the satellite  police  stations
that are there in the  rural  areas,  especially  in  huge  areas,  and  see
whether they cannot be improved, especially when it comes to  postal  banks.
I want  to  believe  that  I  am  talking  on  behalf  of  rural  provinces,
especially KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, North West and Mpumalanga.

Finally, I want to say to Comrade Nkenke: Go well, broer;  it  was  such  an
exciting era to be with you. [Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the IFP joins  all  hon  members  in  this
House in expressing our  sorrow  at  the  sudden  death  of  Rudi  Heine.  I
personally knew him as a kind man of great depth and dignity.

Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  all  Government  departments  can   claim   to   be
multifaceted and complex, and Communications is no  different,  but  perhaps
it is indeed more multifaceted and more complex than  most  departments.  At
the heart of this department lie the  key,  so-called  ``sexy''  sectors  of
broadcasting and telecommunications,  with  the  poor  old  struggling  Post
Office most often given stepchild status, certainly by our committee,  which
we acknowledge time and again.

The IFP supports this Vote.  However,  we  have  no  illusions  that  it  is
adequate for all of its competing needs, and this is a cry that we all  know
is echoed throughout this House in most of the Budget Votes.

Allocations to the Independent Communications  Authority  of  South  Africa,
Icasa, and to the South  African  Broadcasting  Corporation,  the  SABC,  in
transfers in particular, may well prove to be grossly inadequate, given  the
mandates imposed on them by this Parliament.

The Post Office has been thrown another expensive lifeline,  and  there  are
signs that its new management  is  slowly  managing  to  crawl  out  of  the
quicksand that they were thrown into.  We  are  promised  a  positive  turn-
around in the next year. They are grappling,  as  we  all  know,  with  huge
problems and the consequences of the  past  lack  of  a  financial  firewall
between the Post Office and the Post Bank, being but one example at  a  cost
of nearly R1 billion.

In South Africa the Post Office exemplifies in many ways,  as  the  previous
speaker talked about, the ongoing divide in our country  between  the  haves
and the have-nots. And for many haves, like us, it is  unthinkable  that  we
would not have a postal address and access to the Worldwide  Web  and  speed
couriers for our communication needs. On the other hand, millions  of  have-
nots throughout our land continue to have no formal entry  point  for  their
communication needs. They have no address, no post  box.  In  reality,  they
have no access to a critically important identity,  like  their  names,  and
this is what we all know the Post Office is trying to address.

It is a mammoth task, and once again we utter what may  appear  to  be  glib
words of encouragement as we watch those responsible  for  the  Post  Office
negotiate their own shark-infested waters of criminality, competition,  lack
of capacity and so on and so forth,  that  is,  the  current  South  African
song.

Broadcasting, too, brings with it a host of hopes and unanswered  questions.
Under the undoubtedly enthusiastic leadership of the new CEO  of  the  SABC,
who is ably assisted by a competent and committed SABC board,  we  are  told
of exciting developments at our public broadcaster. However, with  the  best
will in the world, can the SABC really  deliver  on  its  huge  and  complex
public service mandates, given the tasks imposed on them by this  Parliament
to be self-sufficient and to compete with itself as  public  and  commercial
entities? Is it really possible  for  the  identified  commercial  entities,
driven by the demands of advertisers and consumers, to deliver much  of  the
money to pay for the costly public service channels required for  the  needs
of language diversity, local content,  news,  current  affairs,  educational
and religious broadcasting and so on and so forth? The IFP has its doubts.

It is relevant to note that in the introduction to the newly released  draft
editorial policies, the SABC board comments, and I quote:


  A number of assumptions underpin the policies. One  is  that  the  SABC's
  current funding model is maintained and another assumption  is  that  the
  current legislative policy and regulatory regime will  remain  relatively
  stable.
In today's world of the convergence of broadcasting  and  telecommunications
of  which  the  Minister  spoke,   complex   technologies   and   increasing
competition and the Communication Department's by-now reliable, ongoing  and
indeed legendary attempts to interfere with and manipulate  the  affairs  of
the SABC, the board can almost be assured that they are not home and dry.

We are promised new convergence  legislation,  as  noted  by  the  Minister,
which  will  undoubtedly  dramatically   alter   the   current   legislative
landscape. Indeed, no doubt the very reason why  the  SABC  board  found  it
necessary to comment on the need for a stable policy and  regulatory  regime
is because of their past experience of literally being  yanked  from  pillar
to post.

The draft  editorial  policies  mentioned  emanate  from  a  hard-fought-for
compromise in the last amendment to the Broadcasting Act which in its  draft
form required the board to submit its editorial policies  to  the  Minister.
Now the public is to have its say and the final  product  will,  mercifully,
be submitted to the Independent Communications  Authority  of  South  Africa
instead of into the hands of politicians.

The IFP commends the SABC for the work  done  on  the  draft  policies  that
overall appear to be excellent. However, we  register  our  concern  at  the
proposal  which  continually  is  referred  to  in  the  draft  as  ``upward
referral'',  ``upward  referral'',  ``upward  referral'',  with  regard   to
editorial responsibility.

We do not believe management, in other  words,  the  SABC  group  executive,
should be in any way able to dictate  editorial  policy  and  be  the  final
arbiter on decision-making relating to editorial comment. There  must  be  a
clear distinction between  editors  and  management.  In  reality  the  SABC
management must deal daily with commercial and political pressures.  Let  us
not be naive about this. Editors, on the other hand, must be left  alone  to
deal with journalistic judgments.

Finally, the IFP thanks Icasa, the Independent Communications  Authority  of
South Africa, for its  often  thankless  task  of  steering  the  good  ship
regulator through the murky and choppy waters of our telecommunications  and
broadcasting  sectors.  We  particularly   commend   its   chairperson   and
councillors for their  hard  work  and  vigilance.  They  ably  continue  to
protect and preserve the independence of Icasa and, like the SABC, they  are
not immune to the machinations of the department. Their recent  reaction  to
a decision by the department, which appeared to sideline  their  involvement
in the rescue 911 selection process of the SNO, is applauded.

Finally, the IFP says a final and formal  farewell  to  Nkenke  Kekana,  our
portfolio committee chairperson who is  a  hugely  talented  young  man  who
clearly has much to offer the telecommunications industry. We wish him  well
and thank him for his hard work. Nat, you know that you  played  a  critical
role in setting a benchmark for inclusive  negotiations  in  our  committee,
and for this you are owed a  great  deal  of  gratitude  by  the  opposition
benches, as well as all the relevant industry players  involved.  Thank  you
very much. [Applause.]

Mrs A VAN WYK: Mevrou die Adjunk-Speaker, die Nuwe NP wil graag sy  simpatie
uitspreek met die familie, vriende en party van die agb Rudi  Heine  wat  so
skielik heengegaan het.

Gisteraand was  dit  veral  interessant  om  'n  informele  oorsig  oor  die
suksesse en tekortkominge van die SAUK vanuit die perspektief van die  SAUK-
Raad te hoor. Me Barbara Masekele het onder meer  genoem  dat  sy  nog  geen
land teëgekom het waar die mense tevrede is met die uitsaaidienste  wat  aan
hulle gelewer word nie, en dat Suid-Afrika nie  die  enigste  land  is  waar
soortgelyke probleme ervaar word nie. Sy  het  bygevoeg  dat  dit  wat  tans
ervaar word, reeds vantevore ervaar is. Meer daaroor later.

Vir gewone mense bly pos-,  telefoon-  en  uitsaaidienste  die  belangrikste
kommunikasiemiddele. Ek wil die Minister, haar departement en  die  betrokke
liggame gelukwens met die  suksesse  en  met  die  goeie  planne  wat  hulle
beraam. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs A VAN WYK: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  the  New  NP  wants  to  convey  its
condolences to the family, friends and party  of  the  hon  Rudy  Heine  who
passed away so suddenly.

Yesterday evening it was especially interesting to  listen  to  an  informal
review of the successes and shortcomings of the SABC  from  the  perspective
of the SABC board. Ms Barbara Masekele, among other things,  mentioned  that
she has not yet come across any country where the people are satisfied  with
the broadcasting services which are given to them,  and  that  South  Africa
isn't the only country in which similar problems are being experienced.  She
added that  that  which  is  currently  experienced,  has  been  experienced
before. More about that later.

For ordinary people post, telephone and broadcasting services are still  the
most important means of communication. I want to congratulate the  Minister,
her department and the relevant bodies  on  their  successes  and  the  good
plans they devise.

I would like to commend Telkom  on  the  targets  achieved.  Everywhere  one
goes, public phones have sprouted like a new kind of vegetation. The  simple
fact of being able to get  in  touch  is  an  enormous  reassurance  to  the
citizenry. There is much work to be done, though, in respect of the cost  to
the consumer of telephone calls. There are countries where the cost is  much
lower and the majority of people in this country are poor.

I would like to see more money being made available  to  fund  research  and
the development of modules to bring down the cost of  calls  and  lines.  We
need to be able to make exact comparisons and calculate  the  true  cost  of
this service to the public.

Pos is iets spesiaals, soos die agb Maserumule dit so  mooi  uitgedruk  het,
veral vir mense in afgeleë gebiede. Daar is 'n soort opwinding daarin om  'n
brief of 'n pakkie  te  ontvang.  Die  meeste  mense  het  nie  elektroniese
kommunikasiemiddele nie. Dit is lekker om na die poskantoor te gaan,  herken
te word deur die personeel en om bekendes daar raak te  loop.  Vonkpos  doen
dit nie vir jou nie.

Die besondere rol wat die posdienste in die gemeenskapslewe speel  moet  nie
verlore raak  nie.  Dit  is  presies  hier  waar  ek  dink  die  veeldoelige
gemeenskapsentrums dit nog verder  kan  aanvul.  Daar  is  oral  nog  'n  ou
poskantoortjie, dikwels nou in onbruik, en soms in aantreklike  boustyle  en
sielige proporsies. Hulle,  as  deel  van  die  bewaring  van  ons  erfenis,
behoort sinvol omskep of  aangepas  te  word  om  in  die  nuwe  veeldoelige
gemeenskapsentrums opgeneem te word. Die publiek sukkel steeds  te  veel  om
gewone dienste te ontvang. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mail is something special, as the hon  Maserumule  put  it  so  succinctly,
especially to people in  remote  places.  There  is  a  kind  of  excitement
involved when one receives a letter or a package. Most people  do  not  have
electronic communication devices. It is pleasant to go the post  office,  to
be recognised by the staff and to meet acquaintances there. E-mail does  not
do that for one.

The special role the postal services play in community life  should  not  be
lost. It is in this area that I think  multipurpose  community  centres  can
further supplement it. Everywhere there is still a little post  office,  now
often in disuse, and sometimes  in  an  attractive  style  of  building  and
soulful proportions. They, as part of  the  conservation  of  our  heritage,
should be meaningfully transformed or adapted to be  incorporated  into  the
new multipurpose community centres. The public  still  experience  too  much
trouble in order to receive normal services.]

Streamlining  joined-up  service  delivery  among  the  three   spheres   of
government and administration should be a priority in this respect.

My agb kollega, Johan Durand, het versoek  dat  die  publiek  ook  toegelaat
moet word om insette te  lewer  in  die  beleidsformulering  van  veral  die
programinhoud  van  die  SAUK.  Die  Nuwe  NP  verwelkom  die  Minister   se
aankondiging in die verband. Ons wil ook graag sien dat daar,  benewens  die
Afrikaanse  groepe,  meer  direkte  deelname  kom  van  die  ander  inheemse
taalsprekers. Ons meen daar is nog nie genoeg nie.

Die  openbare  uitsaaier  behoort  'n  sleutelrol  te  speel  in  taal-   en
kultuurbevordering  van  dit  wat  enig  is  aan  Suid-Afrika.  Ek   verneem
byvoorbeeld daar is slegs sewe boeke  in  isiNdebele  gepubliseer  gedurende
die afgelope tyd. As die  SAUK  nie  sy  rol  speel  om  'n  leeskultuur  te
bevorder deur byvoorbeeld boekbesprekings nie, kan  die  uitgewers  ook  nie
bekostig  om  te  publiseer  nie.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[My colleague, Johan Durand,  requested  that  the  public  should  also  be
allowed to make contributions to the policy formulation  of  especially  the
programme  content  of  the  SABC.  The  New  NP  welcomes  the   Minister's
announcement in relation to this. We also want to see that, in  addition  to
the Afrikaans  groups,  more  direct  participation  comes  from  the  other
indigenous language speakers. We are of the opinion  that  there  are  still
not enough.

The public broadcaster ought to play a key role  in  language  and  cultural
advancement of that which is unique to South Africa. I  have,  for  example,
learnt that only seven books  in  isiNdebele  have  been  published  in  the
recent past. If the SABC does not play  its  role  in  promoting  a  reading
culture by, for example, having book discussions, publishers  can  also  not
afford to publish.]

Another thing one has to consider is that the taxpayer, via  the  SABC,  has
to pay for the  privilege  of  marketing  and  promoting  American  cultural
products. Massive sales prove that cultural imperialism is a reality.  Film,
video and, above all, popular music transmit  the  frame  of  reference  and
value systems of the culture of origin.

As 'n mens byvoorbeeld die radiostasies in Wes-Kaapland  aanskakel,  is  die
oorgrote massa musiek wat uitgesaai word  Amerikaans,  of  dit  nou  gospel,
rock, rap of wat ook al is. Natuurlik is  veel  daarvan  afkomstig  uit  die
kommersiële sektor, maar veel ook van  die  gemeenskapsradio  en  veral  die
SAUK, wat deels met belastingbetalersgeld gefinansier word. (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[If one, for example, turns in on the radio stations in  the  Western  Cape,
the majority of the music that is  broadcast  is  American,  whether  it  is
gospel, rock, rap, or  whatever.  Obviously  much  thereof  comes  from  the
commercial sector, but much also comes from  the  community  radio  stations
and especially the SABC, which is partly funded by taxpayers' money.]

The entertainment and electronic  media  is  also  a  way  of  preparing  or
creating markets for other products.

Dan is  daar  ander  aspekte  van  die  TV  en  die  radiodienslewering  wat
skeefgetrek is. 'n Deel daarvan is die ou storie  dat  te  veel  in  Gauteng
gesentreer is, en dat die ander  provinsies  se  opname-  en  uitsaaigeriewe
verouder, onvoldoende, onderbenut of onderbemark is.  Meer  klem  op  streke
kan 'n deel  van  die  probleem  oplos  en  ook  geleenthede  bied  aan  die
opkomende musici en uitvoerende kunstenaars wat nie  almal  na  Johannesburg
wil  gaan  nie.  Soveel  van  die  talent  in  ander   plekke   waar   groot
konsentrasies mense is, word eenvoudig nie die geleenthede gebied om  lugtyd
te kry en bekendheid te verwerf sodat  hulle  uiteindelik  'n  inkomste  kan
verdien nie. Dan het ek  nog  nie  eens  begin  praat  van  die  binnelandse
gebiede nie.

Die eintlike ding wat my en die publiek die meeste grief is dat  Engels  die
ankertaal is van die SAUK.  Meneer,  kom  ons  gebruik  Afrikaans,  ons  eie
ontwikkelde inheemse taal,  as  die  ankertaal  om  al  die  ander  tale  te
bemagtig. Dit is 'n elegante medium, en  dit  is  tyd  dat  die  uitsaaiwese
daardie ander oorwegings laat vaar ten  gunste  van  gesonde  verstand.  Dit
geld die mark en advertensiewese eweneens. Adverteer in Afrikaans en al  ons
inheemse tale soos toepaslik. Engels kan na homself kyk.

Laastens, die ryke verskeidenheid van kultuur en  taal  wat  Suid-Afrika  so
fassinerend maak, word nog nie voldoende weerspieël nie. En daar is te  veel
van 'n Gauteng-gesentreerdheid wat verpersoonlik word deur 'n  program  soos
Gauteng-aleng. ``Dis lekker in  Gauteng-aleng.''  Almal  dink  nie  so  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]  Baie  dankie.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Then there are other aspects  of  television  and  radio  service  delivery
which are skewed. Part thereof is the old story that too much is centred  in
Gauteng,  and  that  the  other  provinces'   recording   and   broadcasting
facilities are dated, insufficient, underutilised or not properly  promoted.
More emphasis on regions can solve part  of  the  problem,  and  also  offer
opportunities to the upcoming musicians and performing artists  who  do  not
all want to go to Johannesburg. So much of the talent in other places  where
there  are  large  concentrations  of  people  are  simply  not  given   the
opportunity to get airtime and to  become  famous.  Then  I  have  not  even
started talking about inland areas.
The actual thing which grieves me and the public most, is  that  English  is
the anchor language of  the  SABC.  Sir,  let  us  use  Afrikaans,  our  own
developed indigenous language, as the anchor language  to  empower  all  the
other languages.  It  is  an  elegant  medium,  and  it  is  time  that  the
broadcaster let go of those other considerations in favour of common  sense.
This is relevant for the  market  and  advertising  as  well.  Advertise  in
Afrikaans and all our indigenous languages as applicable. English  can  look
after itself.

Lastly, the rich diversity of culture and language which makes South  Africa
so fascinating, is still not mirrored sufficiently. And there  is  too  much
of a Gauteng-centredness which is personified by a programme  like  Gauteng-
aleng.   ``Dis   lekker   in   Gauteng-aleng.''   Not   everybody    agrees.
[Interjections.] Thank you very much.]

Ms N S MTSWENI: I support the Budget Vote on behalf of the  African  Naional
Congress. The tide has turned. Let me echo the words  of  the  President  in
the 2002/2001 South African Yearbook, when he said that ``since the dawn  of
democracy in 1994, Government has made steady progress in  implementing  its
mandate to create a better life for all South Africans.''

The ANC, at its 51st Conference in  Stellenbosch  resolved  that  Government
should increase access to the information  communication  technology  sector
to previously disadvantaged communities, and encourage co-ordination of  the
existing ICT initiatives, such as telecentres and  multipurpose  communities
centres, as well as  public  awareness  on  ICT  and  its  impact  on  human
development.

Today as the ANC, we are proud that the  Department  of  Communications  has
indeed succeeded in fulfilling its mandate of creating  a  better  life  for
all South Africans. We are  encouraged  by  the  work  of  the  Ministry  in
working together with other Ministers on the African  continent  to  improve
the quality of life of the people of Africa. We applaud  the  work  done  by
the mobile operators, Sentech and Telkom in  rolling  out  services  to  the
people of Africa. The miraculous roll-out of  services,  especially  in  the
DRC and Nigeria by South African companies, Vodacom and MTN,  has  not  only
provided access to services by consumers, but it has also created  jobs  and
injected  life  into  these  economies  of  our   beloved   continent.   The
performance of the ICT sector will assist  in  the  renewal  of  Africa  and
Nepad and build confidence in the efforts of  our  leaders  of  the  African
continent.

As the ANC has declared this as the month of urban and rural development,  I
indeed need to emphasise that the ANC has always been  aware  of  the  major
discrepancies between infrastructure in urban and rural areas. This  is  the
reason why the main thrust  of  our  communications  and  telecommunications
legislation has been to roll out infrastructure and services, especially  to
these underserviced  rural  communities.  Our  policy  thrust  is  aimed  at
pushing back the frontiers of poverty, hence  our  commitment  to  improving
the quality of life of the poorest of the poor. I am confronted  by  poverty
every day in my constituency, and the ICT sector has to make a  contribution
in bringing a better life for all in our communities.
An assessment of the period of Telkom's exclusivity is that many lines  were
disconnected due to various factors. However, in rural  areas,  the  billing
system is a problem because  people  do  not  have  addresses  at  which  to
receive their mail. Our entire sector must therefore work in  an  integrated
manner to remove any obstacles. The Post Office has to accelerate  the  roll
out of addresses, as this example demonstrates how  the  lack  of  addresses
impacts on services or service delivery.

We are  encouraged  by  the  introduction  of  pre-paid  services.  Pre-paid
services help in situations where people do not  have  addresses.  It  helps
people also to budget. As a mother, I can attest that children  can  run  up
telephone bills  beyond  one's  budget,  thus  getting  you  into  financial
trouble. Pre-paid services have come as a godsend to many families.

Telkom must encourage consumers to migrate  to  pre-paid  systems  and  must
issue all pre-paid customers with the requisite booklets on how  to  operate
this system. Pre-paid services must be  made  more  user-friendly  and  more
affordable. If this is implemented properly, there  will  be  no  bills,  no
more unpaid services and no more disconnections.

We call on communities to work closely with Telkom and the  police  to  stop
copper theft. Once a copper wire is cut, it  can  disrupt  services  to  the
entire  community.  In  the  spirit  of  vukuzenzele,  we  appeal   to   the
communities in both urban and rural areas  to  blow  the  whistle  and  take
ownership of  their  services.  This  will  assist  in  avoiding  continuous
disruption of access to telecommunication services.

We call on the Minister to encourage the Universal Service Agency to do  its
job of ensuring that telephone facilities and services are  properly  rolled
out and raise awareness about universal service  issues.  The  Ministry  and
the department must assist the USA to deliver its mandate as  stipulated  in
the Telecommunications Act.

We need to come to a common understanding in South Africa on what  universal
service means. It must not only mean the connecting to a  fixed-line  phone,
but must also include connection to a fax and the Internet. Not  only  this,
but we must also factor in the  latest  developments  in  mobile  telephony,
especially considering what has happened recently in  developing  countries,
including those on the African continent.

When we walk the streets, when you are at a taxi rank, in rural  areas,  all
over, you meet people chatting on cell phones. It is  clear  that  the  cell
phones have become a basic service. In South Africa this is demonstrated  by
the number of cell phones as compared to fixed lines.

Cell phones have quickly overtaken fixed-line phones  in  becoming  a  basic
service. Currently Telkom subscribers stand at about 5 million  subscribers,
whereas cellular subscribers amount to more than 11 million  customers.  The
ITU definition of teledensity currently only takes into  account  fixed-line
services. This means that it has not recognised the  technological  advances
made by mobile services in developing countries. At the next ITU  conference
in Geneva, we must therefore  strongly  motivate  that,  based  on  our  own
experience in developing countries, the current  definition  of  teledensity
be reviewed to factor in the roll-out of mobile services. [Applause.]

We welcome the announcement of the Department of Communications  to  conduct
a major review of our telecommunications policy impact by 2005.  We  already
anticipated this when passing our Telecoms Act.  When  we  discussed  fixed-
mobile definitions, we attempted to capture the convergence of  technologies
and the blurred technologies used by fixed and mobile operators. Our  policy
review must recognise that we should  remain  technology  neutral.  However,
technology is not an end in itself, but rather  a  means  to  achieving  our
national  objectives.  Technology  must  assist   in   skills   development,
alleviation of poverty, and improving the quality of life of women  and  the
disabled. We urge all industry stakeholders to work  with  the  DoC  on  the
telecommunications review and to come up  with  well-considered  convergence
legislation. The industry must appreciate  that  we  want  a  South  African
solution to this problem. Policies which  will  come  as  a  result  of  the
review must assist  in  rolling  out  services  to  the  rural  areas  while
continuing to introduce advanced services to existing subscribers.

We, however, urge that universal service obligations remain critical.  While
operators will be able to use whichever technologies they  want  to  provide
services ... Deputy Speaker ... What is happening  now?  ...  We  understand
that the deaf/hard-of-hearing community constitutes 10% of  our  population.
This means that communication for the deaf by telephone is through SMS.  The
costs of SMSs, however, is far  too  high  for  deaf  people  who  are  also
unemployed. Every South African should have access to  information  and  the
means to communicate as well  as  access  to  telecommunications.  The  high
price of SMSs makes the means of communication prohibitive for  deaf  people
and this ought to be  addressed.  I  would  encourage  mobile  operators  to
consider this. They must either bring down the prices  of  SMSs  or  have  a
special package for people who use SMSs frequently.

In conclusion, we wish to say that the ANC supports  the  Budget  Vote,  and
would like to thank the DG and the Minister and the department.  Finally,  I
would also like to say a final thank you and farewell  to  our  chairperson,
Nkenke Kekana. Today is very likely the last day we will see you  as  an  MP
in this Chamber. Thank you for your exemplary leadership and your  guidance.
We wish you well in your new endeavours and  the  new  challenges  that  you
will be confronted with  in  your  new  work.  Thank  you,  Deputy  Speaker.
[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Deputy Chair, today this House must consider the budget of  the
Department of Communications and determine  whether  it  has  fulfilled  its
mandate. The pertinent question that must be asked is  whether  the  ANC-led
Government has kept its stated promise of  collapsing  the  digital  divide.
Despite the Ministers's claim of success in many fields today, with all  due
respect, Minister, these have been in small areas. The major areas have  not
been addressed, or they have not been adequately addressed.

In his 2002 opening address to Parliament, the hon President,  Thabo  Mbeki,
announced that as an example of the ANC's delivering a better life for  all,
the Government had secured an agreement with Microsoft  to  provide  all  32
000 schools in South Africa with free software. The gesture and the  promise
were seen as a valuable  tool  in  bridging  the  digital  divide  in  South
Africa.

However, what has happened since then? Of these 32 000  schools,  less  than
700 have actually received any software. An  embarrassing  and  unacceptable
2% of South African schools have been  unable  to  make  use  of  this  R100
million  donation.  The  reasons  tendered  by  the  Government   for   this
bureaucratic  bungling,  such  as  signing  of  agreements  and  posting  of
application forms, are simply not adequate.

The ANC Government has failed yet again  on  another  promise.  Instead,  we
have a situation in which thousands of schools and hundreds of thousands  of
pupils have a false expectation that they will be part of the cyberworld.

Next week, on 7 June, it will be exactly one year since  this  House  passed
the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act. It would be  instructive
to examine the Act's implementation over the past year. In  the  past  year,
highlights  of  the  Department  of  Communications  include  withdrawing  a
scathing attack on Namespace, with the excuses: ``It went out by  mistake,''
and ``It was published by mistake''.

Secondly, there was the publishing of a  website  for  the  registration  of
authentication services,  cryptography  products  and  holders  of  critical
databases,  including  the  ludicrous  cost  of  a  nonrefundable  R25   000
application fee. The website was quickly pulled down with the  overused  ANC
excuse that it was a ``mistake'' and that it was a ``test run''.

Thirdly, there was the failure to register a domain name to be used  in  the
selection process for the domain name authority, and then they used  strong-
arm bullying tactics to wrestle control.

In the past 12 months, in  addition  to  these  bungles  and  despite  being
required to by the Act, the  Department  of  Communications  has  failed  to
establish an accreditation authority,  with  the  result  that  despite  the
intention of the Act,  many  legal  processes  cannot  be  done  online  yet
because the accreditation structure for  digital  signatures  does  not  yet
exist.

The department has failed to establish a register  of  cryptography  service
providers, creating an atmosphere of  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  to
the extent that some businesses are refusing to ship their products  to  our
shores, and even people like Bill Gates may  be  too  scared  to  visit  our
beautiful country because he, too, could face arrest.

The department has failed to implement the notorious cybercops.  There  have
been some indications that these crime  fighters  will  be  unimplementable,
but even if they  were  implementable,  it  would  be  on  the  basis  of  a
reservist system. Perhaps the hon Minister would like to  respond  on  these
matters.

The evidence is irrefutable. Despite millions being spent in money and  time
by the Government and industry on the Green Paper process and the  whole  e-
commerce  debate,  many  of  the  warnings  and  objections  raised  by  the
stakeholders, particularly by the DA, have come home to roost.

Where the ECT Act is successful is in  the  creation  of  a  framework  and,
where it has failed, is where the Government has  attempted  to  extend  its
control and usurp the interests of industry.

The DA was clear during the parliamentary process, and we  are  clear  today
in this House in that the clauses of the Act that remain  unimplemented  are
exactly the ones that were and will remain unimplementable.

Today  the  Minister  spoke  of  the  future  -  the  forums,  councils  and
colloquiums that will be formed or established to discuss the  role  of  the
ICT sector, but  the  promise  of  collapsing  the  digital  divide  remains
unfulfilled.  Until  we  move  away  from  workshops   and   talkshops   and
unfulfilled promises to actual delivery, that divide will remain.

In my concluding remarks, I would like to pass on  my  sincere  feelings  to
the family of our dear colleague Rudi Heine. His passing is a  loss  to  our
party, a loss to this House and  a  loss  to  this  country.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr M G PHADAGI: Chairperson  and  hon  members,  since  1994  the  SABC  has
experienced a turnaround in its operation. It now has a  capable  leadership
in the form of a properly constituted and accountable board and  management.
It is making a contribution to  our  country  by  informing,  educating  and
entertaining the nation. It is for this reason that we can proudly say  that
the SABC is on course.

Later this year, we will be appointing a new board to take the  SABC  beyond
the present transformation agenda, but what is  this  board  going  to  look
like? As the ANC we are expecting a public-funded model by  the  year  2012.
If I may, I would like to clarify what is meant by  a  public-funded  model.
According to the  resolution  adopted  by  the  ANC  at  its  51st  national
conference in Stellenbosch, a public-funded model of the public  broadcaster
is characterised by cross-subsidisation,  including  parastatal  sponsorship
of local content and investment from different departments.

Furthermore,  to  reduce  SABC  dependence  on  advertising   revenue,   the
Government must increase its funding of the public broadcaster. While  being
entertaining, the SABC must also inform people  and  let  us  celebrate  our
South African institutions. For example,  it  could  showcase  through  soap
operas  and  dramas  how  our  courts,   police   departments   and   health
departments, etc, work. This will inform and educate people, but this  could
also be done in an entertaining fashion. Instead of the department  spending
money on traditional methods of  advertising,  they  could  use  the  public
broadcaster to create awareness in an entertaining manner.

As you all know, Takalani Sesame has received international  acclaim.  While
still on the issue of content, we expect higher content targets as the  SABC
must be about South Africa and tell the South African story and reflect  the
South African experience. South Africans must be able to see  themselves  on
the broadcaster. Their experiences and aspirations must be captured.

While capturing the diversity of our people, the SABC  must  also  instil  a
sense  of  unity  and  national  pride.  In  taking  this  matter   further,
Parliament is hosting the SABC on 3 June to talk about its  draft  editorial
policies. These policies, we hope, will eventually result in  programmes  of
a higher standard and quality, ones which  will  be  sensitive  to  culture,
gender and the well-being of children; programmes  which  will  not  promote
violence against women and  children,  but  ones  which  will  help  to  end
violence against them.

The Broadcasting Act which we amended and passed last  year  made  provision
for two regional language television stations  to  be  licensed.  We  expect
these stations to be up and running by the end of this year. These  stations
must  help  to  promote  multilingualism  and   must   unite   our   people.
Furthermore,  a  dedicated  parliamentary  radio  station  and  a  dedicated
parliamentary television channel must be established. This  will  enable  us
to  take  Parliament  to  the  people,  and  this  House  will  be  able  to
communicate directly with the constituencies it is serving.

The ANC 51st conference in Stellenbosch also put  forward  a  resolution  on
the issue of advertising and the marketing industry,  namely  that  we  must
pursue the transformation  of  this  industry,  including  the  training  of
previously disadvantaged individuals, and that we must engage  the  industry
and encourage local content and the production of  advertisements  that  are
not degrading to women and to people with disabilities.

A few weeks ago the advertising industry acknowledged  the  intervention  of
our committee in the area of advertising and marketing. About one  and  half
years ago, we called the industry to Parliament and held public hearings  on
racism in the industry. The industry now acknowledges that there  have  been
problems in the  industry  and  they  appreciate  the  intervention  of  the
committee in this regard. To this end, on 6 May this year, they awarded  the
chairperson of the committee, Nkenke Kekana, the advertising personality  of
the year award. I expect you to  clap  hands  for  that  because  it  is  an
achievement ... [Applause] ... in recognition of the way he forced  them  to
face up to empowerment issues in the industry.

We are encouraged by the willingness of the industry to  transform  and  the
commitment it has already begun to display. Recently, the industry issued  a
value statement. This is a step in  the  right  direction.  We  are  already
seeing changes. Some stations which previously would not have received  much
advertising are now beginning to receive advertising. We call on  government
departments and parastatals  to  support  the  media  which  promotes  local
content, stations which play South African music and  which  are  accessible
to people who speak  the  various  11  national  languages.  The  Government
should also increase its advertising spending in the community media.

We have seen some major achievements between the period 1994 and this  year.
This House has passed several pieces of legislation to regulate the work  of
the  public  broadcaster.  We  have  seen  the  integration  of   the   TBVC
broadcasters and the transformation of ethnic and racially based  radio  and
television channels to what they are today. Today we are proud  of  channels
such as SABC Africa which is promoting our continent, the AU and Nepad.

The last time we had the SABC board  before  our  committee,  we  complained
bitterly about several issues, including issues of  local  content,  quotas,
the strong bias towards English-medium broadcasting,  programming  and  news
slots, making SABC Africa more accessible and so on. We are  happy  that  we
are  now  noticing  some  changes  the  public  broadcaster  has  begun   to
implement.

We are also mindful of the fact  that  the  public  broadcaster  occupies  a
unique  and  central  role  in  building  and  deepening  our  democracy  by
promoting respect for democratic  values  and  human  rights,  by  supplying
information that allows  our  citizens  to  exercise  their  rights  and  by
reflecting, through its programming, the rich diversity of our country.

Therefore, critical for the achievement  of  these  important  goals  are  a
stable organisation,  excellent  leadership,  great  talent,  South  African
programming that gets our people talking, financial health and  a  positive,
proactive and dynamic organisational culture.

In many of these areas, good progress has been made. For example,  the  SABC
has been stabilised. No longer are staff and  critical  talent  leaving  the
organisation in droves. Competent leaders and managers have been  recruited,
for example, new  managers  who  are  not  so  new  anymore.  The  heads  of
television and radio news and SABC Africa are doing sterling work.

Local content produced and transmitted on television ranks amongst the  best
in the world, and the South  African  audiences  love.  Emzini  Wezintsiswa,
Muvhango, Generations, as well as youthful dramas Gaz'lam, Tsatsa  and  Yizo
Yizo.  However,  the  SABC  is  also  producing  world   class   educational
programmes and documentaries, such as Takalani Sesame, Thetha Msawawa,  Soul
Buddies, Tobias' Bodies and the soon to be screened African Solutions.

News and current affairs are also doing well in the sense that  coverage  of
the World Summit on Sustainable Development has been done properly,  as  was
the coverage of the funerals of  Comrade  Walter  Sisulu,  Govan  Mbeki  and
Hansie Cronje.

Many current affairs programmes have been  introduced,  such  as  Asikhulume
and  Interface.  News  bulletins  have  been  introduced  in   Seswati   and
isiNdebele, while we expect the Xitsonga and Tshivenda  bulletin  to  go  on
air, as promised, in July. This is good news for  the  Limpopo  people.  The
Sotho/Tswana news bulletin has now been brought forward to an  earlier  time
slot.

Financial stability and sustainability have now been achieved with the  SABC
declaring a profit in the year 2001-02, even though it is  very  small.  The
SABC remains with the huge challenge of financial technology  upgrading  and
the shift from analogue to  digital  broadcasting,  and  this  will  require
financial attention and effort.

The SABC must take its rightful place as a public  broadcaster  and  deliver
on  its  mandate  to  educate,  inform  and  entertain,  just   like   other
broadcasters in the world do, and also further address  the  issue  of  sign
language and close captioning,  so  that  television  viewing  may  be  more
accessible to the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities.

Kha Vho-Kekana ri a livhuwa. Ndaa! [Thank you, Mr Kekana.]

Mintirho ya Vulavula. [Actions speak louder than words.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, Minister, molo mhlobo wam [Hello  my  friend].
To the DA, the thoughts of the MF are with you in your time of sorrow.

This  department  serves  as  the  heart  of  our  information  economy  and
knowledge. Through the  department's  mission,  ordinary  people  are  given
access to traditional  media  and  information  technology.  This  certainly
contributes to the improvement of the quality of  life  of  our  people  and
economic growth.

The MF is pleased to note that  during  the  course  of  2001  and  2003  an
additional  1,5  million  South  Africans  gained  access  either  to  radio
services for the first time or to  improved  radio  services  in  accordance
with  the  department's  commitment  to   advance   universal   service   in
broadcasting. It is encouraging to note that the advancement does  not  only
mean keeping up with global trends and technological  development  to  reach
out to our citizenry far and wide in every way  in  which  communication  is
possible. The performance and advancement  of  our  course  is  hindered  by
illiteracy, poverty and minimal resources, but  the  department  appears  to
have a programme in place to work around this.

Attendant postal cost is certainly an asset to  the  disadvantaged.  The  MF
applauds the postal service on adjustments made and good  service  delivery.
Internet communication, as well as telecommunication  show  a  growth  which
Government programmes use to educate in townships and rural  area.  Proudly,
South  Africa  ranks  twenty-third  in  telecommunication  development   and
seventeenth in Internet use globally.  Telecommunications  alone  contribute
between 4% to 5% to our  gross  domestic  product  and  it  is  the  fastest
growing  industry.  Cellular  telephones  have  sprouted  throughout   South
Africa.

We support the Bill. We wish Comrade Kekana well in his new  venture.  Thank
you. [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, hon Minister, when  you  spoke  this  afternoon,
you spoke about the tide having turned. You could have also said  that  this
is about endless possibilities because, indeed, what  we  are  dealing  with
here is about endless possibilities. The department has  indeed  made  great
progress, and South Africa has to be extremely thankful for that.

What I would like to do, is to make a few suggestions as to how we can  take
what has  been  done  a  little  bit  further.  I  would  like  to  see  the
strengthening of Icasa's powers. If it is given the  authority  to  penalise
anticompetitive behaviour, it would be a very good start. I  would  like  to
see it creating a specialised court of appeal that can deal with  litigation
by regulated firms quickly and effectively. If this could be done, it  would
help immensely to increase the resources  given  to  Icasa,  especially  the
human resources in the form of  economists,  lawyers,  engineers  and  other
technical experts so that it can adequately monitor firm behaviour.

We should also look for greater  competition.  I  think  you  yourself  have
acknowledged that in service provision entrants should  be  allowed  to  bid
for universal service susbsidies that contribute to the cost of rolling  out
infrastructure. Targets and conditions  should  include  the  following:  An
affordable tariff, provision to  ensure  that  the  tariff  is  not  heavily
increased in the first years of operation to prevent potential bidders  from
undervaluing the  cost  of  provision;  target  levels  of  teledensity  and
service provision; a maximum allowance  for  cut-offs,  forcing  bidders  to
rigorously evaluate future cost and income flows, adequate consultation  and
buy-in from the community, and some  provision  for  greater  employment  or
skills development of community residents.

We also need to look at the greater liberalisation of the industry. I  think
this is common cause, because that has the real  potential  to  create  many
more jobs. We should be moving towards greater liberalisation  in  order  to
foster competition and lower costs to consumers, lower the  costs  of  doing
business in South Africa and so attract foreign  direct  investment,  create
employment by increasing the demand for young South Africans  with  the  ITC
skills, export skills  to  neighbouring  countries  and  globally,  creating
regional networks, and positioning South Africa as  a  regional  leader  and
provider of IT services.

 I think we also need to give serious consideration to  this  whole  problem
of spam. The United States and other  countries  are  beginning  to  provide
statutory regulations to begin to control spam. I think if we  begin  to  do
that now, we would be proactive.

Something else that  we  need  in  order  for  the  African  Renaissance  to
actually begin to blossom, are dedicated ICT public libraries. The  cost  of
books in respect  of  ICT  is  so  prohibitive  that  those  people  in  our
communities who cannot afford to go to technikons  or  universities  do  not
have any alternative whereby they can begin to acquire  the  knowledge  that
would set them on the road to self-improvement.

We also need to look at the creation of basic devices  to  be  purchased  by
people which could be  used  in  homes  so  that  Internet  connectivity  is
guaranteed universally across all population  groups  in  South  Africa.  At
present the cost of acquiring a computer is forbidding.

We have spoken previously in Parliament of the need to make this  Parliament
an  e-Parliament  in  order  that  all  the  people  of  South  Africa   can
communicate with us and we can communicate with them.

We support you. You have done an excellent piece of  work.  The  better  the
work you do, means that South Africa is going to be  on  the  high  road  to
economic prosperity. We thank you, our Minister. [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Chairperson,  Madam  Minister,  early  this  year,  the  postal
regulator which costs the taxpayer roughly R2,8 million  per  annum,  failed
the very people they are supposed to protect -  the  post  office  consumer.
They failed the consumer because for the second year in a row, they  awarded
the Post Office a higher-than-inflation postal  tariff  increase.  This  10%
increase has resulted in  hard-pressed  consumers  having  to  fork  out  an
additional 15 cents to post a letter. The new price will be R1,65.

When the Post Office was granted a 25-year  monopoly  on  all  postal  items
under one  kilogram,  it  signed  the  licence  with  the  Government.  Both
increases have been in contravention of the Post  Office  licence  agreement
which states that, and I quote:


  For as the licence is exclusive, be subject to a  price  cap,  which  the
  Regulator currently intends shall not exceed Consumer Price Index.

The projected CPI for this year is 7.7%, not  the  10%  that  the  regulator
awarded.

The higher-than-inflation increase  illustrates  two  points:  Firstly,  the
need for the Post Office's  monopoly  to  be  scrapped  and,  secondly,  the
fruitlessness of a body such as the regulator which is incapable of  looking
after the interests of the consumer.
Another project the postal regulator  has  undertaken  is  to  regulate  the
express delivery service  industry,  which  is  of  great  concern  to  most
operators in the private sector who believe that  they  have  been  targeted
due to an error in the drafting of the Postal Services Act.

None of these private organisations had any  idea  that  the  Department  of
Communications was about to claim the right to control and tax them  on  the
ground that they were providing postal services.  The  very  fact  that  the
Post Office operates its own express delivery service business  through  the
Courier Freight Group is the Government's own  admission  that  the  express
delivery  service  is  serving  a  different  market,  providing   different
services to that of the Post Office.

The practical reality is  that  the  Post  Office  is  the  cheapest  option
available to the people of South Africa, and will therefore  always  be  the
first choice for anyone wishing to send an item.  No  rational  person  pays
more than he or she has to pay for a product or service he or she needs.  If
the  Post  Office  feels  it  is  necessary  to  protect  its  position   by
prohibiting private operators  from  charging  the  same  price,  there  are
precedents such as the measures  taken  in  Australia  and  other  countries
which we can use.

For  example,  in  1975,  with  the  establishment  of   Australian   postal
commission, the commission retained  the  qualified  letter  monopoly  where
letters weighing up to and including 500g were referred to as  the  reserved
services. However, private  companies  were  allowed  to  compete  with  the
Australian postal services in  the  carriage  of  letters  in  the  reserved
services if they charged at least 10 times the standard letter rate.

In 1994, the weight and price  threshold  to  competition  were  reduced  in
Australia from 500g to 250g and from  10  times  the  letter  rate  to  four
times. If South Africa were to  use  the  same  formula,  private  companies
would have to charge at least R16,50 for them to deliver a standard  letter.
This  cannot  be  considered  competition  for  the  Post  Office.  As   the
legislation currently stands, and as the regulations are  currently  worded,
the private sector is threatened with the imposition  of  an  arbitrary  and
damaging tax which  can  only  damage  the  industry  and,  ultimately,  the
economy. It is to be hoped that the long-awaited  regulations  will  resolve
this situation.

Another concern for the DA is the fact that  the  financial  statements  for
five financial years  were  outstanding  until  recently.  In  February,  we
received three years' financial statements. However, the 2000-01  and  2001-
02 statements are still  outstanding  despite  the  assurance  made  in  the
committee meeting of 18 March 2003,  and  a  later  hollow  promise  by  the
Minister herself that we would be receiving them in April  this  year.  This
promise was made in a parliamentary reply.

Chapter six of the Public Finance Management Act states that  the  financial
statements must be submitted within five months of the end of the  financial
year. This just shows how the Minister and her department had  been  allowed
to flout the law yet again.
Lastly is the issue of the fine  the  Post  Office  had  to  pay  for  using
software illegally for a period of nine months. I  asked  the  Minister  and
the Post Office whether the fine of R711 000 was indeed more than  what  the
actual licence would have cost. On both occasions I was assured  that  there
had been no additional cost to the taxpayer. In fact, the Minister said  and
I quote: ``... the amount  paid  for  the  damages  was  equivalent  to  the
contract's fee.'' However, on closer inspection, the opposite was true.

The Post Office was quoted  a  sum  of  36  012  US  dollars  or  R360  000,
excluding VAT, for the use of the software for two years.  The  Post  Office
was fined over R700 000 for nine months' piracy, meaning the  taxpayer  paid
almost an incredible six times more than what they would have paid  had  the
Post Office not broken the law. To me, giving false information in  response
to a parliamentary question, either intentionally or not, indicates the  rot
within the Post Office and the department.

The Minister also mentioned in her  speech  about  the  North  West  project
regarding senior citizens using the post bank in accessing  their  pensions.
What the Minister failed to mention to  the  House  was  that  the  cheapest
tender was not used. In fact, the tender from the company which was  awarded
the tender was twice the amount of the cheapest tender, and the company  was
only formed once the tendering process had actually been closed.

From these issues and the lack of financial records, it is obvious that  the
Post Office and the department believe they are above the law and  any  form
of accountability. Sadly, if one looks back at  the  past  four  years,  the
only conclusion one can come up with is that they are right.

If you will allow me, from the DA side we would  like  to  wish  hon  member
Kekana all the best in his new endeavours. You  will  be  sorely  missed.  I
think the level of debate here today indicates how much you will be  missed.
We wish you well. Bye bye. [Applause.]

Mr R D PIETERSE: Chairperson, allow me also to pass  my  condolences  on  to
the family of Rudi Heine and his party. I'm sure, given the  gentleman  that
he was, he will be sorely missed in this House. So, my condolences to them.

Daar word van ons almal verwag om saam  die  grense  van  armoede  terug  te
stoot. Dit, agbare lede, is wat van ons almal verwag word  wanneer  ons  aan
die verskeie begrotings se besprekings deelneem. Maar voor  ek  daarby  kom,
wil ek net so ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is expected from all of us to push back the frontiers of poverty.  That,
hon members, is what is expected from all of us when we participate  in  the
discussion of the different Budget Votes. But before I come to that, I  just
want to ...]

Hon Dene Smuts, I can only ask you to keep on dreaming, and  you  know  that
you are not allowed to dream in this House. You are supposed  to  take  note
and respond equally. So, keep on dreaming. [Interjection.]
Vincent, Vincent, hon Vincent Gore, you talk about small things. Only  small
minds notice small things, and maybe it's because you're  suffering  from  a
small party syndrome where you come from. Hopefully one day, just  hopefully
one day, you'll grow up.

Mr Mike Waters, I can  only  appeal  to  you  because  you  seem  to  be  in
possession of a lot of information. You seem to have inside  information.  I
can only appeal to you also to grow up and  hand  over  all  these  relevant
detailed documents  to  the  relevant  authorities  for  them  to  prosecute
whoever is guilty of corruption and theft and all of that.

Hon members, I rise on behalf of the ANC to  support  this  Budget  Vote,  a
Budget Vote  that  will  ensure  that  job  creation  takes  place  through,
firstly, job retention and, secondly,  skills  assessment  and  development,
but most importantly, through  using  IT  to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty by informing people of their rights and how to access  it.  As  this
is the month of urban and rural  development  in  our  Letsema  campaign,  I
trust, hon Minister, that we will also be rural-biased.
I am also rising to support the calls of  our  minor  sporting  codes,  very
often referred to as  the  Cinderella  sports  by  those  that  run  out  of
excuses, and which are practised by particularly  women  and  the  disabled.
Banyana Banyana, as an example, is the second best soccer  team  in  Africa,
but the time shown on television is problematic. SAFA and  the  broadcasters
allowed a golden opportunity to slip  through  their  fingers  when  Banyana
Banyana played against Jamaica and England, respectively.  They  could  have
played curtain-raisers to allow the continents of Africa and Europe  to  see
the skills of our women soccer players.  Yet  there  are  excuses  why  they
can't play; why they can't be shown on television.

Netball South Africa is another example - I am wearing the tracksuit  -  and
is number five in the world. The world champions are poaching  our  players.
Some of them are playing in Australia and some of them are  playing  in  New
Zealand, because the show time that they are being  offered  is  inadequate.
Particularly here, I am saying, the broadcast times are unsatisfactory.  All
the broadcasters, free-to-air and even the pay channels, should  improve  on
their delivery in terms of women's sports as well  as  the  sports  for  the
disabled.

Agbare Minister, somtyds vergeet ons dat  hierdie  mooi  land  van  ons  nie
altyd vry was nie en dat dit soms net absoluut hel was om in te leef.  Omdat
ons nie toegang gehad het tot die elektroniese media nie, moes ons  ons  eie
planne maak. Hoeveel keer, byvoorbeeld, is  Bush  Radio  se  toerusting  nie
deur die destydse Suid-Afrikaanse polisie gevat nie?

Soortgelyke optredes het dwarsoor die land gebeur, maar die mense was ``fed-
up''. Ons het genoeg gehad en het begin terug baklei, en  in  1992  het  ons
die vrugte onder die ANC begin pluk en proe.

Ja, agbare  lede,  gemeenskapsradio  het  begin  om  uit  te  saai  met  die
besonderse bystand van die ANC-geleide alliansie. Die mense het gepraat,  en
die ANC het gehoor en geantwoord met 'n duidelike plan van  aksie.  Dus  kan
julle sien dat die ANC omgegee het en aan die mense gehoor gegee het,  selfs
voordat die ANC aan die bewind gekom het.

Kom ons kyk wat gebeur het met die gemeenskapsradio vandat die ANC  in  1994
aan die bewind gekom het: Gauteng - 22 lisensies  uitgereik;  Limpopo  -  8;
Mpumalanga - 10; Noordwes - 4; Oos-Kaap - 11; Noord-Kaap  -  3;  Wes-Kaap  -
15; Vrystaat - 10 en Kwazulu-Natal - 11. Agbare lede, soos u  kan  hoor,  is
daar meer as 94 lisensies vanaf een jaar  tot  vier  jaar  aan  meer  as  94
stasie uitgereik. Dadelik het ons gemeenskap toegang  tot  radio  wat  hulle
nie voorheen gehad het nie.

Nadat Icasa hierdie  lisensies  toegestaan  het,  het  die  Departement  van
Kommunikasie ingetree om te verseker dat hierdie stasies nie ondergaan  nie.
Wat het  hulle  gedoen?  Die  Departement  het  die  infrastruktuur  vir  'n
ondersteuningsprogram begin wat aan ongeveer 42  stasies  beskikbaar  gestel
word.

Die Departement is ook verantwoordelik vir die instelling van  'n  program-,
produksie-  en-  ondersteuningsprojek  wat   kwessies   soos   gestremdheid,
misdaad,  kinders,  vroue,   MIV/Vigs,   asook   plattelandse   ontwikkeling
aanspreek en aan verskeie gemeenskapsradiostasies  beskikbaar  gestel  word.
Agbare lede, met hierdie feite van my, asook  dié  van  die  ander  sprekers
voor my, moet ons heelhartig saamstem dat die gety inderdaad gedraai het.

Daar is nogtans baie werk om te doen, en daarom wil ek 'n beroep doen op  al
ons raadslede in ons verskillende munisipaliteite  om  ons  gemeenskappe  te
help om aansoek te doen vir hulp en ondersteuning van  die  MDDA.  Ons  moet
soveel  as  moontlik  gemeenskapsradio's  kry  in  en  vir  ons  gemeenskap.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows)

[Hon Minister, sometimes  we  tend  to  forget  that  many  of  us  in  this
beautiful country of ours were not always free, and that  at  times  it  was
utter hell to live in this country. Since we did  not  have  access  to  the
electronic media, we had  to  make  our  own  plans.  How  many  times,  for
example, did the former South African police  confiscate  the  equipment  of
Bush Radio?
Similar actions occurred throughout the country, but the people were  fed-up
with it. We had had enough of it and started to fight back; and in  1992  we
started to harvest and taste the fruits under the leadership of the ANC.

Yes, hon members, community radio started to broadcast with the  exceptional
support from the ANC-led alliance. The people spoke, the ANC heard them  and
answered with a definite plan of action. You see, the ANC does care and  did
listen to the people, even before the ANC came to power.

Let us look at what has happened to community radio since the ANC came  into
power: Gauteng - 22 licences issued; Limpopo - 8;  Mpumalanga  -  10;  North
West - 4; Eastern Cape - 11; Northern Cape - 3;  Western  Cape  -  15;  Free
State - 10 and KwaZulu-Natal -11. Hon members, as you heard,  more  than  94
licences were issued for a period from one to four years  to  more  than  94
stations. Evidently, our community has access to radio which  they  did  not
have before.

After Icasa granted these licences, the  Department  of  Communications  got
involved to ensure that these stations did not  merely  go  down.  What  did
they do? The department came  up  with  the  infrastructure  for  a  support
programme and made it available to more than 42 stations.

The department is also responsible for the implementation  of  a  programme,
production and support  project  that  covers  issues  such  as  disability,
crime, children, women, HIV/Aids, as well as rural  development,  and  makes
it available to several community radio stations. Hon  members,  with  these
facts stated here by me, as well as those of  other  speakers,  we  have  to
agree wholeheartedly - indeed, the tide has turned.

There is still a lot of work that needs to be done, and I therefore want  to
call on all councillors  in  the  different  municipalities  to  assist  our
communities in applying for assistance of the MDDA. We need to get  as  many
community radio stations as possible for our communities.]

Hon  members,  we  and  Icasa  have  to  ensure  that  nobody,  particularly
political parties, abuse community radios. Remember, the community radio  is
the media through which the community participates  as  planners,  producers
and performers, and gives  expression  of  that  particular  community.  The
media, in particular the electronic media, needs to report and cover  Africa
as Africans. True and honest stories of Africa and Africans must be told.

Hon Minister, as we are approaching the month  of  the  youth,  I  sincerely
hope that we will give expression to the need of the  youth  to  have  their
own dedicated youth radio station. We can and must use our  community  radio
to report on sport that has been played in our communities.

I raised it last year, and I want to raise it again. I, Randy  Pieterse,  am
paying my TV licence. Are you? Minister, are you  paying  your  TV  licence?
Where's Thandi Modise? Derek, are you people all  paying?  Only  if  you  do
that will you have a moral leg to stand on when complaining about the  SABC.
Forget about being elected as public representatives. We also need  morality
when we do tackle the problems of a public  broadcaster.  I'm  paying  mine,
and I want to urge all of you to talk to your  community  to  do  the  same.
Then you will have a moral leg to stand on. Now, forget about the  DA.  They
will complain anyway. Derek, no, I can't take it now. I can't take  it  now.
You have to ... [Interjection.] I will  assist  you  to  get  your  licence.
Thank you. [Interjection.] But I am doing that.

Soos die beter lewe voor ons afspeel in my kiesafdeling, sê  die  mense  met
een stem: Viva ANC! Viva! En wanneer jy antwoord met  'n  ``Viva''  antwoord
hulle dan baie harder: ``Long live the ANC!  Long  live!''  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

As a better life for all is evident in my constituency, all the  people  say
with one  voice:  ``Viva  ANC!  Viva!''  And  when  one  answers  back  with
``Viva!'', they shout even louder:``Long live the ANC! Long live!'']

Indeed, we are using broadcasting to push back the frontiers of poverty.

Allow me to thank the Minister  of  Communications,  Minister  Ivy  Matsepe-
Casaburri, the Director-General, Dr Andile Ncaba and  his  team.  A  special
word of thanks goes to Peter Matlare and his team, the rest of the  captains
of industry - MTN, Vodacom, Cell C, Telkom - I'm not so sure  about  Telkom.
They did some serious poaching. [Laughter.] Telkom, anyway. Thanks  also  to
Sentech, the Universal Service Agency,  M-Net,  and,  by  the  way,  to  the
mobile operators. I believe that Cell C is seriously catching up.  So,  pull
up your socks and watch it!

Bra Ned, jy is 'n  ou.  Loop  mooi.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows)

Bra Ned, you're an oke. Go well.]

The ANC supports this Budget Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N N KEKANA: I am just feeling a sense of  déja  vu  because,  during  the
GCIS debate, I was bidding farewell  to  Parliament.  However,  since  I  am
still a member of Parliament, I was again asked  to  say  farewell  in  this
debate, and therefore I will start  my  farewell  by  saying  that  the  ANC
supports this particular Budget Vote.

I just want to say to Dene that there is  no  crisis.  There  is  no  crisis
either in our  policies  or  the  implementation  of  our  policies,  or  in
legislation. We have said many years ago that you  can't  chase  technology.
It's like the wind.  You  can't  catch  the  wind.  It  is  impossible.  You
wouldn't succeed. So we'll  not  be  able  to  keep  up  with  the  pace  of
technology. It's like trying to keep  up  with  thinking.  You  continue  to
think all the time.

And I think, Mr Waters, that if you point a  finger  like  this,  there  are
three fingers that are pointing back at you. Perhaps you need to  relook  at
how you've been approaching the debate here in the House, because you  can't
just  rely  on  leaks  from  the  Post  Office.  You  need  to  be  able  to
constructively make a contribution  in  as  far  as  the  solutions  of  our
country are concerned.

You see, we need to look back with pride at the 10 years of  our  democracy,
and we need to say that we have achieved a lot. There is still  more  to  be
done, and we need to be proud of where we come from. However, let's  not  be
surprised because Simon Singh observed in his book entitled  the  Code  Book
that tools of communication have always been pursued by kings, by  generals,
and by rulers to preside  over  their  subjects.  And  thus,  I  agree  with
Comrade Lekgora that communication is a contested terrain. There are  always
ideological battles, and we should not expect that there will be  a  silence
of debate in the House.

For a full text of my farewell speech,  without  repeating  myself,  let  me
refer people to the website of Parliament. I did my farewell  speech  there,
and if you could access it - I hope it is there - you will get a  full  text
of my speech.

I just  want  to  thank  everybody.  Thank  you  to  the  Minister  for  the
leadership that you have given; to the  Director-General  for  the  sterling
work that you have done. Many people do not  recognise  the  work  that  you
have done, but history will recognise that, especially the  work  on  skills
development. I think the industry can a learn a lot from the work  that  you
have done together with your team there.

I want to thank many of you for having been a part of my life for  all  this
time. I thank the ANC. The ANC has brought us up, many of us. At  times,  it
has thrown us into the deep end, but we always  managed  to  swim  to  shore
because of the belief that our people need to  be  free.  I  am  very,  very
proud of having been a member of this Parliament,  having  been  a  part  of
you. I would like  to  thank  you  individually  and  collectively  for  the
guidance and the leadership that you have shown me, and for  the  confidence
that you have shown in me also.

I think if we work together we  will  achieve  a  lot.  We,  as  members  of
Parliament, have a responsibility to promote this institution as  a  working
institution. Our democracy can only  thrive,  it  can  only  improve  if  we
ourselves, as members of Parliament, ensure that this institution works.  It
is a pillar of our Constitution and, as such, we need to be proud of  it.  I
also  thank  the  industry  for  respecting  Parliament,   for   coming   to
Parliament. I know that many top CEOs have come to Parliament to  pay  their
respects, but also to make very valuable inputs from time to time.  I  think
we need to keep up that  work.  It  is  a  very  good  contribution  to  our
country, and we need to continue to work together in that sense.

I am looking forward to the new challenge. I am  very  excited  about  going
out there. I am not going out of the industry itself. I  will  remain  loyal
to many of the things that we have said  and  done.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Thank you, Chairperson. I would really  like
to thank many of the members who spoke in support  of  this  budget.  Unlike
the previous budgets, I was expecting quite a bit of contestation here  from
my left, and today there was quite a lot of  support.  Miskien  is  dit  die
toenadering van Suid-Afrika, ek weet nie. [Maybe it is South  Africa  making
advances, I don't know.]

I have to say, maybe to start with Dene, because she's always the  one  that
starts to sort of needle you and tease you through what she says. Dene,  one
thing that I learnt very early in life, not only from my parents,  but  also
from my community is ... ``Moenie krap waar dit nie  jeuk  nie.  En  dis  'n
baie  goeie  Afrikaanse  spreekwoord.  [And  this  is  a  very   appropriate
Afrikaans proverb.] Especially in a  sector  that  is  as  fast-changing  as
that, you don't go into it like a bull in a china shop. You have to look  at
things and decide.

On the issue around convergence and the colloquium,  we  spoke  about  it  a
long time ago, also  in  the  portfolio  committee.  So  when  we  read  the
proposal by the DA, there was nothing new they  were  giving  us.  In  fact,
what we were saying, is that  we  actually  have  to  go  out  and  see  the
experiences of other countries, and that is why the colloquium was not  held
in March last year, and is only being held now.

It is because of this caution that we have to make sure that we bring in  as
many views as possible, including the views of the DP, if they have  any.  I
have no objection to that, but I would like to say it is important  that  we
should perhaps have asked why that is so, despite the fact of what  Gardener
is saying. There have been these many bidders that  came  immediately  after
the Icasa process ended. Where were they? They are respectable  bidders.  So
somewhere Gardener was not telling the truth, and I knew we would be  proved
right, and we have been proved right. So Gardener should not be  the  person
who should guide us as to what is good for  South  Africa.  Those  investors
made their decision to say South Africa is still a destination for  them  to
make investments. [Interjections.] Well, you'll find out soon.

I also wish to refer to contributions made by hon Van Wyk who  talked  about
``die gemeenskapsentrums'' ["the community centres''.] Veral vir  mense  wat
uit die platteland kom, is dit baie belangrik om gemeenskapsentrums  te  hê.
Baie mense het na die statistieke gekyk en gesê  nee,  die  departement  ...
[Especially for people from the rural areas, it is very  important  to  have
community centres. Many people looked at the statistics and  said:  No,  the
department ...]

Statistics  show  that  you  don't  have  increased  -  what  they  call   -
teledensity. The teledensity is  going  down.  What  they  didn't  tell  the
people is that, as fixed lines were going down  -  because  teledensity  was
measured only in terms of fixed lines -  in  fact,  cellular  telephony  was
going up. So you can't just use  one  measure,  because  the  services  were
actually provided in a very different way which was  much  more  convenient.
We have to look at the totality and not only at some.

I would like to thank the hon Susan Vos for really also reminding  us  about
things that we sometimes forget, because as South Africans, we  always  want
to get better and better and forget the things that we can do very  well.  I
thank her for the compliments that she paid the  management  and  the  board
and the staff of the SABC and SAPO.

It has really been very difficult to turn  these  ships  around.  They  have
been heavy ships, and that could not  have  happened  without  the  kind  of
quality which you had to search for. It required saying, when you can  find,
that you can and when you can't, not saying that you can't.  You  eventually
find them, and eventually they do a lot of good work for us. So I thank  you
for that.

The challenge of convergence is really going to  be  quite  a  challenge  to
some. ASNET has also talked about managing the contestation and  the  vested
interests that exist. Many people do not  want  to  change  their  thinking.
Convergence is going to challenge each and everyone of us, from the  way  we
used to do business and  the  way  we  used  to  think  we  should  run  our
business, to a totally different way of doing things. It's  going  to  be  a
challenge of enormous proportions, and I think all of us ought to get  ready
for it.

I would also like to pull together the issues around local content that  the
hon Cassim and also the hon Van Wyk  brought  up:  the  issues  of  cultural
imperialism, the books ... die boeke wat nie daar is vir die  tale  van  die
mense nie, en so aan. [The books that are lacking for the languages  of  the
people and so on.]

This is found only when we develop local  content.  However,  this  involves
many of the young people who are the future, who are sitting in the  gallery
now. They are writing. I mean that they have  language  portals  writing  in
Venda and other languages the histories of the  people.  That  is  enormous.
Before  long,  I  think,  members  of  Parliament  should  make   themselves
knowledgeable about what those young people are doing. I think it is  really
indeed a great job.

Hon Gore talks about Microsoft's offer. He doesn't tell us that there are  2
000 schools in South Africa that do not have electricity. So, if we have  to
give these ones ... Dan moet almal van ons wat het, gee, want  dié  wat  nie
het nie, sal nie kry nie. Hulle het nie  elektrisiteit  nie.  [Then  we  who
have, must give to every one who has not, because those  who  do  not  have,
will not receive. They do not have electricity.]

So there is a connection between whether you  have  the  buildings,  because
sometimes  you  have  a   building   but   not   the   building   that   ...
[Interjections.] But that is exactly where the  roll-out  of  infrastructure
comes in. It is not just Telkom's infrastructure; it is also the  supporting
infrastructure that must bring these services in ICT. As Government we  must
work together.

So the focus is on this; this is why we are also  looking  at  many  of  the
things. And therefore, when Madam  Smuts  talked  about  African  operators,
etc, the Institute for Remote Services is very important in terms  of  doing
that. So we need to be able to say there must be buildings and  the  promise
of the digital divide collapsing. I have gone to  provinces.  I  have  moved
around provinces. There are problems that many of them  have  that  Mr  Gore
may not have experienced.
Klein plekkies in die Vrystaat, soos Viljoenskroon,  Steynrust;  plasies  in
die Bothaville-distrik - ek weet wat die probleme is. Ek is nie  blind  nie.
En ek weet dis waar ek my werk moet doen. [Small places in the  Free  State,
such as Viljoenskroon, Steynrust; small farms in the Bothaville  district  -
I know what the problems are. I am not blind. And I know  this  is  where  I
have to do my work.]

So it is not a question of a government that has  forgotten,  but  it  is  a
Government that says when you plan, you have to plan  for  the  future,  and
you must plan for the majority that does not have, and not the few  that  do
have. For example, regarding what he said about the accreditation centre  in
the implementation of the ETC Act, of the people that run the Trust  Centre,
there are quite a number of women working  there.  They  must  be  wondering
what Mr Gore is really talking about. So  it  will  be  important  that  you
actually realise this, because of the issues that we're raising. Ek hoop  jy
kan lees. [I hope you can read.] Because they were reading test sites.

However, with regard to many of the other things, I think  it  is  important
that we look at them. For example, Mr Cassim has said we must  look  at  the
issues around spam. Indeed, the computer virus monitoring centre,  which  is
also run by many of these young  people  and  even  the  telecommunications,
especially cellular companies, have asked why  they  should  all  run  virus
monitoring. If you can do it, why don't you rather do it for us and  we  pay
you, etc? Indeed, there is work that  is  being  done.  Some  of  the  young
people who do that work are here. En baie van hulle  lyk  soos  ek  wat  die
kleur betref.[And many of  them  look  like  me  as  far  as  colour  goes.]
[Interjections.] That is good. We're going to be quite surprising.

Well, there were certain things or facts that I will not go over, because  I
think it is important that we actually educate ourselves about a  number  of
things that we have been talking about. I thank all  the  members  who  have
been supportive of this Bill, and I think indeed we have a future.

At the beginning, I said the Government of this country knows where we  come
from. We have no intention of going back there. We know where we are  going,
and we ask you to imagine what the  future  would  look  like  if  we  armed
ourselves with these new technologies and used them to make a difference  in
our people's lives. I talked about what happened nine  years  ago,  what  we
looked like.

But now, I would indeed like to use the words of Ntate Sisulu:


  We can make this revolution one of the greatest, for  indeed  we  have  a
  country of remarkable people who are ready, who are willing and  able  to
  make this country an even more remarkable place, and to do  so  with  the
  use of these new technologies.]

I thank you. [Applause.]

  PROTECTING AND DEFENDING CHILDREN'S RIGHTS IN SOCIETY AND CALLING FOR AN
                             END TO CHILD ABUSE
                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr E SALOOJEE: Madam Speaker, hon members,  the  idea  of  an  international
children's day arose from the 1925 World Conference  for  the  Wellbeing  of
Children  in  Geneva,  Switzerland.  This  conference  was  attended  by  54
countries and passed the Geneva Declaration protecting children.

The world has come a long way since 1925, but the day  is  still  celebrated
in many countries around the world and is meant to be a day  of  celebrating
the potential of our children. In South Africa we choose to  celebrate  this
day in many ways, but the central theme to be gleaned from  the  very  first
celebration remains the same: the  protection  of  our  children.  In  other
words, what are we as the Government of this country doing  to  protect  the
rights and wellbeing of our children?

This obligation is clearly illustrated by the words of  Carol  Bellamy,  the
executive director of Unicef, that the interests of the  child  shall  be  a
consideration in all actions  concerning  children,  whether  undertaken  by
public  or   private   social   welfare   institutions,   courts   of   law,
administrative authorities or legislative bodies.

Among the key obligations that we have in terms of  international  treaties,
is to adopt legislation that will effectively promote children's rights  and
wellbeing. Members of this Assembly have  been  involved  in  detailed  work
around a new children's statute since  1996.  As  has  been  the  experience
elsewhere, it is an enormous undertaking, and given the importance  of  such
legislation, one has to acknowledge that such legislation cannot  be  rushed
through the Assembly.

We are proud that the work has advanced to such an extent that  there  is  a
draft Bill that is being discussed widely. I would like to  reflect  briefly
on some of the critical issues addressed in the draft. I must  say  that  in
the history of children's legislation, this is  the  very  first  time  that
you're going to have a comprehensive Bill.

We have a world-class Constitution and this draft Bill gives  expression  to
the constitutional rights of children and then goes  on  to  make  proposals
around what services must be put in place for those rights to  be  realised.
So for the first time in our history,  the  legislative  framework  will  be
focused on enabling the child to prosper  in  the  context  of  his  or  her
family.

The Bill moves away from the narrow focus of the Child Care  Act  on  formal
protective measures, and outlines the  kind  of  preventative  service  that
would aim at protecting vulnerable children before they need to  be  removed
from their family and environment because of abuse or neglect.

I believe that the issue of children's socioeconomic rights will be  a  very
difficult issue to deal with because of the enormous  resource  implications
of  providing  the  most  vulnerable  children  with  access   to   adequate
nutrition, shelter, basic health care, educational opportunities and  social
assistance. However, the debates will be exciting  and  I  believe  that  we
will make the right decisions for our children.

Other pieces of legislation that will impact significantly on the  lives  of
children in South Africa are the Social Assistance  Bill  and  the  National
Social Security Agency Bill. The Social Assistance Bill proposes to  address
problems with regard to the delivery of social grants, such as  low  take-up
rates and delays in the approval and payment of  grants.  Should  this  Bill
succeed in all that it sets out to do, this will significantly  improve  the
lives of all the children of our country.

The establishment of a  national  agency  responsible  for  the  payment  of
social security grants has been suggested as one of the ways  in  which  the
administration of this system can be improved. Such an  agency  can  have  a
profound impact on children, and the Department of Social  Development,  the
Portfolio Committee on Social Development and  civil  society  organisations
are engaging each other as to the best and  most  effective  ways  that  the
agency can serve our children.

In order to improve the protection we offer children in  South  Africa,  the
Government has mainstreamed children's needs in the budgets of a  number  of
key Government departments. We have made  significant  improvements  in  the
health and education systems, ensured housing for millions of  families  and
extended social assistance benefits to at least 2,7 million children by  way
of the child support grant.

The significance of the child support grant lies in the  fact  that  it  was
the first social assistance measure that  sought  to  bring  equity  to  the
manner in which state benefits are made available to poor children. In  line
with our President's 8 January statement, in which he said that we must  use
the state budget to improve the lives of the poor, Government has this  year
approved the gradual extension  of  the  means-tested  child  support  grant
beyond the age of six to poor  children  up  to  their  14th  birthday.  The
extension will take place in a phased manner over three years.

The extension of  the  age  cohort  has  been  widely  welcomed  as  another
indication of our Government's continued commitment to improving  the  lives
of all our children. It  is  also  a  significant  step  in  addressing  the
crippling poverty that we have inherited.

Let me now address the question of children who  have  been  orphaned  as  a
result  of  HIV/Aids  and  the  increase  in  the  number  of   child-headed
households. The  Nelson  Mandela  Foundation  and  Human  Sciences  Research
Council's research work on HIV/Aids last  year  suggests  that  13%  of  our
children have lost one or both their parents due to the pandemic.  At  least
3% of these households are headed by children.

We must acknowledge that there  are  some  shortcomings  in  the  protective
measures for such children. The Social  Assistance  Act,  Act  59  of  1992,
provides that only persons older than 18 may access a grant on behalf  of  a
child. If the eldest sibling in a child-headed  household  is  younger  than
18, that household will not be able to apply for  any  grants  of  any  kind
because there is no adult in the household to formally receive the grant.

Despite popular  opposition  rhetoric,  we  are  not  simply  ignoring  this
situation. The draft children's Bill contains some proposals  around  caring
for child-headed households. The most  notable  proposal  relevant  to  this
discussion  is  the  introduction  of  a  cluster  foster  care  system   in
communities where there are large numbers of children without parental  care
and support.

The Bill envisages a system in which adult  supervisors  are  appointed  for
each of the child-headed households in  the  community.  Such  a  supervisor
should be able to apply for child support grants and other  social  benefits
on the children's behalf, and advise the children  on  how  best  to  access
services or utilise benefits.

This person will have to be accountable to the community and to  Government,
perhaps by way of a community-based organisation,  a  church  structure,  or
through the presence of a community development worker. There has  been  the
suggestion that while improvements  to  the  social  assistance  system  are
taking place, it might be appropriate to locate provisions for  child-headed
households directly in the Social Assistance  Act.  I  believe  that  it  is
crucial for us to make a clear policy decision about this and to table  that
legislation as soon as possible.

It has become a sad reality  in  our  society  that  we  encounter  horrific
stories about the emotional, physical and sexual  abuse  of  children  on  a
frequent, almost daily basis. In order to focus on one of the  most  heinous
crimes  against  children,  namely  sexual  abuse,  as  you  all   know,   a
parliamentary task group on the sexual abuse of children was  convened  last
year.

Significant recommendations were made in the report  of  the  task  team  on
sexual offences against children, and I'd like to highlight a few  of  them.
Firstly, we need to strengthen legislation to  protect  children,  including
defining sexual abuse as a distinct form of abuse  that  requires  a  direct
response from Government and society. The work that the  SA  Law  Commission
is doing around the new children's Act is dealing with  this  substantially.
Secondly, we need to ensure an integrated response from Government  agencies
working with children by considering for inclusion  in  the  new  children's
legislation a basic basket of  preventative  and  protective  services  that
Government must make available. Thirdly, we need to strengthen the  criminal
justice system to protect children and prevent abuse, and fourthly, we  need
to raise community awareness of the effects of abuse  on  children  and  the
services available to assist in the protection of children.

I must also state here  that  all  those  Government  departments  that  are
involved in the process around the  whole  issue  of  the  sexual  abuse  of
children, after the recommendation in terms  of  the  briefings  that  we've
had, have made  substantial  advances  in  the  way  of  implementing  those
recommendations.

Let me state that we have not betrayed and  do  not  intend  to  betray  our
children. Several  of  the  recommendations  of  the  task  team  have  been
translated into concrete measures by Government departments. The  Department
of  Social  Development  has  reported  that  a  draft  strategy  on   child
protection has  been  completed.  The  department  is  currently  consulting
stakeholders around this policy document.

In  addition,  the  national  policy  guidelines  for  handling  victims  or
survivors of sexual abuse were produced under the direction  of  the  Deputy
Minister of Justice in September 1998. In July 2002, the Gender  Directorate
reprinted 650 copies of policy guidelines, which  were  distributed  to  all
magistrates. The guidelines include the requirement of the use of  technical
aids, such as one-way mirrors  and  closed-circuit  television  to  insulate
children  from  secondary  traumatisation  through  contact   with   alleged
perpetrators.
In addition, an interdepartmental task team has  also  been  established  to
implement national strategy for the  roll-out  of  sexual  offences  courts.
Twenty-nine sexual offences courts have already been established  in  crisis
areas, although some of  them  are  not  fully  compliant  with  the  sexual
offences courts blueprint yet. A number of courts  have  been  dedicated  or
are in the process of being dedicated to  the  hearing  of  sexual  offences
cases.

The Justice College has also reported that court personnel receive  training
on how to deal with victims of sexual violence.  This  training  is  ongoing
and specialised courts have  been  established  to  adjudicate  such  cases.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr M WATERS: Chair, hon Deputy Minister, this is the fourth debate on  child
abuse that this House is engaging in in about one year. If all the  hot  air
talked here by the ANC was actually matched  by  action  on  the  ground,  I
would welcome a debate per day. Sadly, the  truth  is  quite  the  opposite.
Since the start of my visits to the 45  child  protection  units,  some  six
months ago, an estimated 13 594 children have  suffered  rape  or  attempted
rape; 12 908  children  have  been  assaulted;  9  756  children  have  been
assaulted with the intent to do grievous bodily harm; 2  640  children  have
been indecently assaulted; and 792 children have  been  murdered  -  roughly
four murders per day.

I believe that in these  six  months,  128  additional  officers  have  been
placed at the CPUs. However, since there was at least 693 vacant  positions,
this means that 565 child  protection  officers  are  still  needed  at  the
existing CPUs. What is more, is that there are areas in the country that  do
not have such units whatsoever. If you divide the 120 officers  amongst  the
45 units, it works out to just fewer than three new recruits  per  unit.  If
one looks at the Mitchells Plain CPU, for example, which has a  shortage  of
85 members, it could take 29 years or until 2032 before the current  optimum
levels are reached if the Government continues at this  slow  pace.  The  DA
finds this totally  unacceptable  and,  quite  frankly,  an  insult  to  the
children of  our  country.  My  niece,  your  daughter,  your  son  and  our
grandchildren deserve better than that.

Another aspect that the DA will not tolerate is the lack  of  training.  If,
as we often hear from the ANC, child abuse is considered a  priority  crime,
why  then  have  only  47%  of  all  CPU  officers  been  trained  in  child
protection? Surely, given the nature and sensitivity of  these  crimes,  the
Government would have ensured that a  child's  first  line  of  defence  was
impeccable. The question  must  be  asked:  If  innocent  children  are  not
protected by the criminal justice system, can we really expect  the  justice
system to protect other citizens?

Dr E E JASSAT: What are you doing?

Mr M WATERS: I have been to all the units. That is what I have  been  doing,
hon member. [Interjections.] I have come back and given my findings here.  I
have  done  more   than   your   Minister   and   your   entire   committee.
[Interjections.]

What is worse is that this is not the only  area  in  which  we  betray  our
children. The Minister of Social Development admitted  in  this  House  that
there is a shortage of 1 400 social workers. That is a  shocking  indictment
of how this Government perceives child-related matters. How on earth does  a
Minister allow a situation to collapse to such an extent?

The Minister of Health admitted in this House that only  128  state  doctors
have received training on how to use the new kits which are used to  collect
DNA evidence, evidence  which  is  vital  in  obtaining  convictions.  Logic
states that before any new system is introduced into any  organisation,  the
people affected must be trained. This again highlights  the  ANC's  lack  of
commitment to the children of our country. In addition, on 7 March,  I  sent
documentary proof to the Minister of Health regarding doctors who refuse  to
examine children after they have been raped. The Minister is yet to  have  a
meeting to discuss the dire situation.

The Minister of Safety and Security also admitted that as  far  as  forensic
scientists at the DNA laboratories were concerned,  there  were  413  vacant
positions. Those men and women analyse crucial evidence for the  courts.  It
is they who often determine whether a person will get  away  with  rape  and
abuse or if he/she will be put behind bars.

The lack of CPUs in the Western Cape and Free State is of grave  concern  to
the DA as each of these provinces have only two  units.  Both  Western  Cape
units are situated within the metro. That leaves the children of the  Boland
and the southern region defenceless as they have to  report  crimes  to  the
local police stations which in many instances do not have  trained  officers
in child abuse. The Goodwood unit which has a  staff  shortage  of  73%  has
since 1992 been unable to investigate all crimes committed against  children
in their area, and the Mitchells Plain unit has had a shortage of 82%  since
1994. How  long  does  this  Government  need  in  order  to  address  these
imbalances? I ask you, hon members, does this situation reflect an  attitude
of a Government that cares? Is this really the people's party at  work?  Not
even the ANC, in all honesty, can answer: Yes. Thank you. [Applause.]

[Miss M XULU: Chairperson and hon members, like adults, children  also  have
a right to live a peaceful, safe, secure and protected  life  so  that  they
can grow up in a proper manner and fulfil their  dreams  in  life.  What  is
painful is that the majority of children in our country do not  have  access
to that protection. Our children encounter numerous problems  while  growing
up because they live in an unsafe environment which is not conducive to  the
observance of children's rights.

Most children grow up in homes where violence is the staple  diet,  so  much
so that a child may end up thinking that that is an acceptable way to  live.
A child internalises such behaviour and takes it to school, where he or  she
encounters another type of violence  between  students  and  teachers.  This
past week there were a number of incidents in which  children  attacked  one
another in schools, and one such attack resulted in the loss of a life.  Our
children carry dangerous weapons which they get from parents.

In other communities children from the age of seven years  and  upwards  are
used by gangsters in their corrupt activities because they  know  very  well
that since those children are young, they will be given light  sentences  if
they are caught. Children live  in  a  precarious  state  because  of  these
gangsters, since it's the children who  suffer  first  from  criminal  acts.
Because of the daily street fights  of  these  gangsters,  children  can  no
longer play in their own backyards because their  lives  are  at  risk.  All
these things violate children  psychologically  and  emotionally,  and  that
makes them fail to grow up as individuals with sound minds, individuals  who
are sensitive towards other people.

In our country, one in four girls and one in eight boys  are  abused  before
they reach the age of 16 years. We all  know  that  hardly  a  day  goes  by
without an incident of child  abuse  in  our  country.  In  most  cases  the
abusers are  relatives  or  people  who  are  known  to  children,  such  as
neighbours. It is very stressful to children to be abused  by  someone  they
like and respect, and this leads children to lose  all  hope  regarding  the
adults who are close to them.

Other challenges faced by our  children  are  poverty  and  the  devastating
disease Aids. This disease has left many orphaned  children,  most  of  whom
face the responsibility of having to look  after  themselves,  while  others
face the challenge of looking  after  sick  parents  and  younger  siblings.
Having these responsibilities thrust  upon  them  disturbs  children,  since
they themselves are still growing up and need someone  who  will  attend  to
their physical and psychological development so as to enable  them  to  face
life as adults. This situation of losing parents, and that  of  having  sick
parents, which makes them  unable  to  work,  brings  with  it  immeasurable
suffering to families, and this  severely  disrupts  the  development  of  a
child.

We commend the Government for its efforts  to  combat  the  maltreatment  of
children through  programmes  such  as  child  support  grants.  Though  the
Government tries to do so much, there  are  still  many  areas  that  it  is
unable to reach. For example, there are those  children  who  cannot  access
grants because their parents are alive while they are unable to work due  to
certain circumstances, and those children  who  cannot  be  accommodated  in
such programmes because their ages are over the stipulated limit. Those  are
the very same children who end up being enticed by gangsters. The  gangsters
make them engage in all sorts of misbehaviour and promise them  money  which
they can use to support their families.

Other children are exploited by their  relatives,  while  others  still  are
exploited by employers because they are poor, they are  young  and  they  do
not have anyone who can fight for  their  rights.  What  is  of  the  utmost
importance is that even though our Government is doing so  much,  and  there
are laws which protect the rights of children, the major challenge  that  we
face as a nation is that Government should not be seen as the one  and  only
party  that  can  solve  this  problem.  We  are  all  responsible  for  the
protection of the rights of children, from the members of this House to  the
nation as a whole. The time has come for us South  Africans  to  internalise
deep down in our hearts that children are human beings like the rest of  us.
Lastly, we say that those are the reasons  why  iNkatha  yeNkululeko  taught
values of ubunto botho so that people could return  to  their  customs.  The
IFP therefore supports this debate. I thank you.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, the scourge of child and women  abuse  afflicts
our society. As a country we are going through a transition, having  emerged
from a social milieu in which we could not make free choices  and  shape  an
ideal environment of our choice in which we could develop social  and  moral
values that would sustain a moral society. In building a new  South  African
society that will be devoid of the moral and social aberrations that  plague
us today, we need to know where we come from and where  we  are  going.  The
value  systems  that  sustained  our  forebears,  before  external  colonial
intervention and the resultant social disruption,  should  be  our  landmark
and point of departure.

A traditional African homestead is a cosy, warm, protective shrine  for  the
African child. He is nurtured in love in an orderly life  regulated  by  the
family head, the mother and the elder siblings within the  extended  family,
the clan and the tribe as a whole. At the moment of  birth,  he  is  ushered
into the warm cloister of the traditional  midwives  in  the  maternity  hut
where he begins his life's  journey.  A  libation  goat  is  slaughtered  in
welcome and thanksgiving. He is enshrouded in  an  atmosphere  and  aura  of
love and warmth. He emerges  from  this  mystique  cloister  into  the  warm
welcoming hands of the family members and the extended  family.  Appropriate
rituals are performed and more libations made to  prepare  and  fortify  the
child for the journey of growing ahead.

He stumbles the first tentative steps  and  grows  into  a  spirited  little
urchin who can  now  begin  appropriate  apprenticeship  in  the  designated
chores of tending the calves and goat kids if he is a boy,  or  assist  mama
in preparing and washing the dishes if she is a girl. The boy  graduates  to
heading larger herds in the company of his peers and learns  the  skills  of
self-defence and survival in  the  veld.  The  girl  advances  to  gathering
firewood, tending the crops in the fields, emulating the role of the  mother
in keeping the home fires burning.

All this takes place in a social framework regulated by norms,  customs  and
value systems which underscore respect  for  elders  and  cordial,  friendly
respectful interaction with peers. These are  responsibilities,  rights  and
obligations in their network of relations. There are rewards for  excellence
and sanctions for deviation from acceptable conduct. There is stability  and
equilibrium in which well balanced and  socially  adjusted  caring  children
are raised and prepared to take their rightful place in the community.

The boys grow up to become men and girls  to  become  women.  They  both  go
through their initiation rituals,  namely  circumcision  for  the  boys  and
intonjane or another accepted initiation for  the  girls.  We  must  caution
against value judgments in this regard because  such  value  interpretations
may be misguided if taken out of context by judging outsiders. At  the  same
time, we must allow the need for adjustment and modification in  a  changing
and modernising society to obviate distortions  of  customary  practices  if
mechanically applied, which often leads to abuse  and  tragedy.  The  entire
exercise  is  designed   to   prepare   young   adults   to   assume   their
responsibilities and play their role in the community.

The central theme in African socialisation is nurturing  ubuntu,  humanness.
This concept entails doing good  to  others  and  fostering  the  spirit  of
goodness and humanness. Respect for your  peers,  for  your  neighbours  and
strangers alike are instilled. Children must  respect  their  elders.  Every
elder is your mother or father, every child is a  son  or  daughter  in  the
community which is bound together by a uniform system of values.  Chastising
any deviant child by a parent is obligatory and it is not  frowned  upon  as
child abuse.

According  to  Muslim  tradition,  immediately  upon  delivery,  after   the
severance of the umbilical cord and after the new-born baby  has  bathed,  a
senior male member of the family, preferably the father,  gives  the  Azaan,
the Muslim call to prayer, in the ears of the new-born. The mother  is  then
expected to remain indoors for at least 40 days. The  baby  and  the  mother
may after 40 days go  outdoors,  but  during  its  infancy,  the  mother  is
expected to take care that  both  of  them  do  not  spend  too  many  hours
outdoors in the evenings.

Prior  to  the  social  disruption  occasioned  by  the  external   colonial
intervention in African societies,  there  was  a  strict  code  of  conduct
regulating the relations between young men and women.  Social  and  physical
contact occurred within a well defined set of  rules  and  parameters  which
castigated promiscuity as a social and moral aberration. Any departure  from
the prescribed limits of physical contact between young men  and  women,  if
it in any way attempted or threatened to  violate  the  honour  of  a  young
maiden, was judged and punished harshly with heavy penalties. This  deterred
the incidences of premarital pregnancies, with  all  the  social  ills  that
come with it.

Similarly, sexually transmitted diseases were either unknown or  very  rare.
I am trying to depict a picture of a traditional African  environment,  with
its behavioural norms, checks and balances that  regulated  the  conduct  of
members of the traditional communities and minimised the  opportunities  for
child abuse.

This House is  all  too  familiar  with  the  tragedy  of  colonialism.  The
consequences of conquest and the imposition of an alien social and  cultural
system of African societies disintegrated the social fabric which  sustained
the values described above. The disruption  caused  by  deindustrialisation,
where men were forcibly dislocated from their homes and society  and  forced
to live in abnormal crammed bachelor  quarters  away  from  their  families,
demonised them and eroded their self-respect.

They were herded together like cattle and were treated as no more than  mere
boys and tools with which to burrow the bowels of the  earth  in  search  of
precious  stones  for  the  masters.  On  the  farms  they  were  frequently
humiliated, insulted and whipped  until  they  began  to  accept  their  new
status as irresponsible boys who should submit to the  punishment  by  their
masters.

The cruel and dehumanising subjugation  has  had  a  tragic  impact  on  the
African soul. We are therefore faced with the challenges  of  salvaging  our
ancient values, preserving those that are timeless  and  weaving  them  into
the fabric of our modern society. We must reconcile the old with the new  in
the changing world. Naturally we will discard the antiquated and  unsuitable
practices.

Our choices must be objective and the yardstick for their  applicability  or
otherwise. We cannot afford to be mechanical in our choices. Neither can  we
afford to be dogmatic or allow prudences to colour our  judgement.  What  we
need is a healthy synthesis of the old and the  new,  which  will  form  the
moral and social foundation of a new South Africa.

The demise of traditional African societies has resulted in the collapse  of
our moral values.  The  Government,  under  the  leadership  of  the  Deputy
President, has sounded the clarion call for moral regeneration.  As  already
indicated, in times of crises, nations dig up their past; resuscitate  their
nation's heroic deeds; they recreate their  heroes  and  heroines  and  they
extol their best values which sustained preceding generations. The hour  has
come for us do the same. While we cannot restore the past, we can  refashion
the  present,  borrowing  from  the  past  and   being   inspired   by   its
achievements.

Poverty eradication is central to the creation of an  environment  in  which
child abuse cannot thrive. It is commmon knowledge that the  degradation  of
poverty, characterised by hunger and squalid living  conditions,  exacerbate
moral decay. Child abuse abounds in these subhuman conditions. I thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Chairperson, in a press release by the  Minister  of
Social Development on 22 May, he stated:


  Child Protection Week should serve  as  a  period  in  which  all  of  us
  rededicate ourselves to building a better  life  for  all  our  children.
  Child protection must be everybody's business. We  need  to  protect  our
  children from all forms of abuse,  vulnerability  like  poverty  and  the
  HIV/Aids pandemic.

These are very nice words, and I know that  the  Minister  is  very  serious
about the protection of every child in this country.

However, as far back as 16 June 1995, the South African Government  ratified
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,  and  the  Cabinet  reaffirmed
its commitment to the legal instruments that were put in  place  on  15  May
2002. During August 2002  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Social  Development
approved and adopted the Optional Protocol on the Rights of the Child.  This
protocol has not yet been signed, so how serious are we in  our  efforts  to
become a world partner in the fight against child abuse?

As there is a significant  increase  in  the  international  trafficking  in
children  for  the  purpose  of  selling,  child  prostitution   and   child
pornography, it is essential that a wide  network  of  countries  should  be
part of an effort to eradicate these despicable acts against children.

There is  a  wide  variety  of  factors  contributing  to  these  despicable
practices, such as  a  lack  of  education,  urban-rural  migration,  gender
discrimination, irresponsible adult sexual  behaviour,  harmful  traditional
practices, armed conflicts and trafficking in children.

The New NP believes that there should be a stronger world-wide  calling  for
the  criminalisation   of   the   production,   distribution,   exportation,
intentional possession and advertising of child pornography,  and  stressing
the importance of closer co-operation and  partnership  between  governments
and the Internet industry.

This protocol will really contribute to the implementation  of  those  steps
that will provide a better  life  for  all  children,  not  only  our  South
African children, but children all over the world.

The New NP wants to urge the Minister of Foreign Affairs - because  this  is
where it is now being held up - to make a serious  attempt  to  support  the
Minister of  Social  Development  and  the  committee,  and  the  world-wide
campaign against the atrocities against the child and finalise  that  matter
immediately.

Voorsitter, dit het tyd geword dat elkeen van ons nie  net  sal  praat  nie,
maar sal stilsit en luister na die geroep, die aanklag  en  die  waarskuwing
van die kind in nood. Amanda Strydom het 'n  lied  geskryf,  genaamd  ``Gees
van die kind'':


  Jy fassineer my
  Hipnotiseer my
  Jy bekeer my
  Laat my doop
  Manipuleer my
  Motiveer my
  Orkestreer my
  Gee my hoop
  Iemand moet die kettings breek, iemand moet die brug oorsteek
  Iemand moet die slang vermoor, sy kop met duisend dolke boor
  Ek sal opstaan
  Konfiskeer my
  Verrinneweer my
  Terroriseer my
  Gee my stroop
  Molesteer my
  Onteer my
  Impliseer my
  Die deur is oop
  Jy kan doen wat jy wil; ek is hier om te bly
  Ek is die gees van elke kind wat op die aarde ly
  Jy kan my nie ignoreer nie; jy sal dit voel wanneer ek skree
  Jy sal betaal vir jou vergryping tot die berge antwoord gee
  Ek is die gees van elke kind
  Ek gaan groot word
  Ek gaan slim word
  Ek gaan sterk word
  Hou my dop
  Ek gaan opkrop
  Ek gaan vreemd word
  Ek gaan kwaad word
  En dan ontplof.

Voorsitter, dit het tyd geword dat  iemand  die  kettings  breek,  die  brug
oorsteek; dat iemand die slang vermoor en die kop met 'n duisend dolke  boor
vir die kinders van Suid-Afrika. [Tyd  verstreke.]  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, the time has come for each one of us not only to talk, but  to
sit still and to listen to the call, the accusation and the warning  of  the
child in distress. Amanda Strydom wrote  a  song  entitled  ``Gees  van  die
kind''.]

[Chairperson, the time has come for someone to break the  chains,  to  cross
the bridge; for someone to  kill  the  snake  and  slash  the  head  with  a
thousand  daggers  for  the  children  of  South  Africa.  [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the  findings  by  the  SA
Congress for Early Childhood Development  reveal  that  almost  two  million
South  African  children  are  battling  with  hunger  every  day.  The  UCT
Children's Institute estimates that 11 million children, more than  half  of
all South African children, were living in poverty in 2002.

South Africa commemorates Child Protection Week  while  the  Government  has
failed to meet promises it made last year during  National  Children's  Day,
namely to protect and improve the lives of children. Child  Protection  Week
is just lip service unless Government recommits itself to a country fit  for
children and ensures that they are put  first,  that  they  have  access  to
education, are protected from harm and exploitation, poverty  is  eradicated
and HIV/Aids is combated.

In the Eastern Cape  alone  hundreds  of  children  are  admitted  daily  to
hospitals with malnutrition and a significant number  die  of  marasmus,  an
avoidable condition caused by a lack of calories and protein. It is  evident
that in some provinces  people  are  unable  to  get  child  support  grants
because  of  problems  in  obtaining  ID  documents.  The   high   rate   of
unemployment  that  is  silently  observed  by  the  Government  contributes
tremendously to the suffering  of  the  children.  As  for  the  Growth  and
Development Summit, a good test of its success would be to  ask  afterwards:
How many of these 2 million children won't be going to bed hungry anymore?

Sadly, until now Government has  failed  to  act  on  the  findings  of  the
children's rights organisation, Molo Songololo. The findings  indicate  that
in one of Cape Town's major townships, child sex exploitation,  rape,  abuse
and child prostitution have reached alarming proportions. The  inability  of
the Police Child Protection Unit to cope with about 3  000  cases  of  crime
against children reported each month because  they  are  understaffed  makes
one wonder whether the Government is  sincere  with  its  theme  of  ``Child
Protection  is  Everyone's  Business''.  Is  this,  as  is  the  case   with
unemployment, the ANC Government's way of saying: It is  the  responsibility
of everybody, except Government?

Ms N  M  TSHEOLE:  Chairperson,  hon  members,  this  debate  offers  us  an
opportunity to reflect,  to  introspect,  to  acknowledge  inadequacies  and
challenges, and to chart a way forward.

I hope the House shall, after today's debate,  emerge  with  recommendations
that can  assist  those  directly  tasked  with  the  actual  protection  of
children, and not just indicate weaknesses, but come  up  with  suggestions.
This is why we are here.

To dedicate this debate to the protection of children is not to add salt  to
an open wound, but it is to create hope for these  children  that  something
will be done. What we are saying is what  the  children  are  feeling.  Tell
them what you think should be done, and do not repeat  their  pain,  because
you are making the pain worse. [Applause.] By  merely  indicating  how  many
children are still living in poverty you are not helping. This  is  a  known
figure, and I do not know how many times it has  been  repeated  this  week.
[Interjections.]

I listened to what they are saying. Weaknessess and inadequacies  cannot  be
denied. Through the fact  that  we  are  here  to  discuss  and  debate,  we
acknowledge those weaknesses, and we want to say something and give hope  to
those children and not destroy their hope.

Child protection broadly implies not only abuse, but  also  covers  poverty,
neglect, exposure, crime, drug addiction and illness. It  is  a  very  broad
concept. And when one looks at this, it cannot, as Mr  Van  Jaarsveld  said,
be the responsibility of the  state  only.  It  has  to  be  a  partnership.
Communities have to play their role.

Hon Saloojee referred to what the Government has put  in  place  to  address
the  challenges.  Inadequacies  might  be  there,  but  when  we   look   at
inadequacies,  most  of  them  are  as  a  result  of  the  lack  of   joint
participation of families. Hon Mbadi  also  laid  a  foundation  for  us  by
referring us to the traditional way of bringing up  children,  not  only  to
say we should go back, but to look at those values that could assist us.  We
should be identifying  issues  that  could  assist  us  in  alleviating  the
issues, not only looking at  Government.  When  we  emphasise  the  role  of
Government at  the  expense  of  the  role  of  families,  we  are  dragging
communities backwards. We are saying communities themselves  should  not  do
anything, but that only the Government is there  to  do  something  for  the
communities. We are saying this, knowing  well  that  our  communities  have
suffered long periods of poverty, and I am going to  quote  Mankin  here  in
indicating the role of a history of poverty in a community:


  A recession can have permanent effects  if  it  changes  the  people  who
  become unemployed ...  a  long  period  of  unemployment  may  change  an
  individual's  attitude  towards  work  and  reduce  his  desire  to  find
  employment.

This is a situation that we find most of our families  in.  We  are  quoting
this, not to justify  the  inabilities  of  families  to  look  after  their
children, but to indicate to members  of  the  opposition  that  the  issues
faced by this Government did not start in 1992 or in 1994. There has been  a
deliberate attempt by the apartheid  government  to  engineer  a  period  of
hysteria to ensure that people are not able to do anything for themselves.

Some of the people, even if there are jobs,  are  not  qualified,  and  they
cannot do the jobs. We find that Government  has  to  deal  with  vulnerable
families.  We  are  talking  about  many  vulnerable   families,   and   the
vulnerability did not start in 1994. It is a long process and  it  is  going
to take long to change, but  we  find  the  problem  of  the  protection  of
children is not only among poor  families,  it  even  occurs  in  well-to-do
families.

Just yesterday an hon member from the DA asked a follow-up question  to  the
Minister indicating the challenges that are faced by  middle-class  families
who give a lot of cash to their children, and as a result the children  have
access to drugs. These are not challenges which the Government has  to  deal
with. It is the responsibility of families. Let us not just  concentrate  on
challenges facing poor families.

The issue of child drug  abuse  is  widespread.  It  attacks  rich  families
mainly. It attacks mainly rich families. When we come to drug addiction,  it
is mainly children who have access  to  cash  and  who  are  not  from  poor
families. These well-to-do children have parents who  are  in  denial.  They
are not prepared to address the issue but blame the state.  They  will  talk
of the drug authority, but they will never say what  they  as  a  family  do
about it.

The other issue that we find is the issue of crime. You will  find  that  it
is not only with regard to poverty, but it is the morale of the family  unit
which is not playing  its  role.  Let  us  not  just  look  at  it.  We  are
representatives. Let us talk to our  communities  and  the  people  whom  we
represent and say: Let us do something. Let us not just look  at  Government
to do something for us.

When we look at guns, it is those families  who  are  rich  who  can  afford
guns, and they are negligent.  The  parents  allow  their  children  to  get
access to guns, and it is these children who traumatise other kids  and  who
kill teachers and other children at school. What are we doing  as  families?
Are we saying that the Government has to police every family to indicate  to
every parent how much cash he or she must give to their children  when  they
have money? We are not. What we come back to is  to  say:  Children  are  in
prison and the Government is not doing anything.  Are  we  doing  enough  as
families? Let alone those families, the Government's  responsibility  is  to
look after vulnerable families; not after negligent parents.

Another issue is that of ubuntu that the hon  Mbadi  referred  to.  We  find
that, unfortunately, we have moved away from the cultural issue  of  ubuntu.
The Moral  Regeneration  Programme,  under  the  leadership  of  the  Deputy
President, is trying to bring that back. We hope it  will  succeed  and,  at
the same time, we know there is an attack. Somebody asked  a  question  last
week, and asked why we wanted to create structures  instead  of  looking  at
it, and at the same time, we are looking at the Government;  the  Government
must regenerate our morale.

What are we doing as families? Are we reneging on  our  responsibilities  as
parents? Do we blame the Government? Is that what we  want  to  do?  Are  we
going to say to the electorate: We are in Parliament. The Government is  not
doing enough, so relax. Let your children be criminals.  Let  your  children
steal. Are we not going to encourage families  to  do  something  to  attack
poverty? Are we not going to educate families to grow vegetable gardens?  In
the past we used to have subsistence farming.  There  have  been  a  lot  of
changes  which  affected  the  fibre  of  the  family  to  move  away   from
subsistence farming, because people were made to believe  that  you  were  a
better person when you were wearing a tie. We  know  the  white  communities
are the farmers who provide our food and they do not wear ties. People  were
made to believe that you are better when you are employed in an  office  and
wearing a tie. People shifted away from subsistence farming. There could  be
other challenges like climatic  conditions,  but  I  think  there  is  still
something that we as representatives could do to educate our families to  do
and ensure that they protect their children against illness and  poverty  so
that when the Government puts into place programmes, they are successful.

The impact of Government programmes will not be felt  as  long  as  families
are just sitting there and expecting the Government  to  do  everything  for
them. We as representatives should  do  the  responsible  thing.  There  are
shortcomings, but programmes are in place  and  this  is  not  an  overnight
thing. It is a process, changing the  minds  of  the  nation.  It  will  not
happen overnight. It is going to happen perhaps to your  children,  but  you
are already a part of that. You had better do something with  your  children
and not look at us. [Time expired.][Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, this is a very serious debate  whose  importance
is underlined by Jesus in Mark 10, verse 13, when he said: ``Let the  little
children come to me and do not hinder them''. Earlier in Mark 4,  verse  42,
he says and I quote:


  If anyone causes one of these little children to sin, it would be  better
  for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around  his
  neck.

The responsibility of adults and parents for the wellbeing  of  children  is
very clear. Children in human society are helpless and weak  when  they  are
born.  They  depend  on  adults  for  their  entire  moral   education   and
upbringing. The UN Charter, as well as our excellent Constitution  emphasise
children's rights and their entitlement to  upbringing,  education,  health,
shelter, food and so on. As Parliament, we take our cue from there and  must
assume our responsibility in passing legislation which offers  children  all
those rights.

Today we live in a society which has a shocking record of  women  and  child
abuse. In some ways we are  receding  to  barbarism.  Many  animals  have  a
better record of child care. This is putting it rather strongly. We need  to
tighten  up  as  a  nation.  Why  are  people  guilty  of   dereliction   of
responsibility and as adults still  allowed  to  go  about  society  with  a
measure of respectability?

Society as a whole needs to censure individuals who  are  no  longer  human.
The values of ``ubuntu'' ``botho'' are critical to our wellbeing.  Laws  are
important, but moral norms and standards are of paramount importance.  Crime
Quarterly of March this year states and I quote:


  By the time they turn 18 years of age, 20% of girls ...

We must protect our children in a way that will ensure  the  future  of  our
nation, society and the entire human species. [Time expired.][Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the protection of our children should  not  be
and is not the responsibility of one body, but rather  intersectoral.  There
are a number of departments whose contribution would prove to be  beneficial
to the protection of children and preventing child abuse.

The  MF  notes  that  the  Departments   of   Justice   and   Constitutional
Development, Education, Health,  Home  Affairs,  child  labour,  Safety  and
Security, Foreign Affairs,  the  Office  on  the  Rights  of  Children,  the
National Prosecuting Authority, as well as civil society have embarked on  a
project of preventing and managing child abuse.

A number of factors need to be taken into account  since  issues  pertaining
to the matter of child abuse are extremely sensitive. The MF  is  in  unison
with all efforts to stamp out all forms of child abuse.

It is pleasing to note that many  perpetrators  of  child  abuse  have  been
brought to justice, but we want to stamp out abuse  completely.  Abuse  robs
our children of their innocence and humanity.  Often  we  find  articles  of
abuse in the paper, such as the teacher who has been accused  of  abusing  a
number of his students. This is unacceptable.

The MF hereby calls on all role-players, especially the community, to  stamp
out child abuse and neglect. Let us make  our  children  our  priority.  The
abandonment of children has become a major  consequence  to  which  HIV/Aids
has made a large contribution. The plea for safe sex has visibly  fallen  on
deaf ears, and innocent children bear the brunt. Innocent babies  are  being
exposed to this in contravention of their human rights.

The MF supports the protection and defence of the child's rights in  society
and calls for an end to child abuse.

Ms G M BORMAN: Chairperson, 18 months ago, I spent a day in a police car  in
the upmarket surburb of Westville where I live.  Late  in  the  afternoon  a
call came, directing us to a house where there was a report of child  abuse.
The report came from the domestic servant  whose  little  girl  of  six  was
watching TV in the lounge of the house. The 71-year-old father of the  owner
of the house had gone into the lounge and was interfering  with  the  little
girl. Fortunately, the child's mother walked in before any serious  violence
happened. By reporting the incident,  the  mother  ran  the  risk  of  being
dismissed from her employment.

Today no child is safe anywhere - not in the home, school and  not  even  in
church. Such is the society in which we live.  Minister  Skweyiya  has  said
that over the next three years the theme for his department will be  putting
children first. The World Summit for children in 2001 stated that:


  The children of the world are innocent, vulnerable  and  dependent.  They
  are also curious, active and full of hope. Their childhood should be  one
  of joy and peace, playing, learning and growing. Their future  should  be
  shaped in harmony and co-operation. Their lives  should  mature  as  they
  broaden their perspective and gain new experiences.

That is all very beautiful. It is what we all dream  of  for  our  children,
but the reality is very different. Daily we are faced  with  headlines  that
shock us. ``Teachers giving extra classes,'' they say, ``in  bedrooms!''  Or
again, ``Atlantis, lost city of child abuse, rape, prostitution!'' Or  ``The
rising toll of schools drug scourge!'' Or ``Many  child  sex  offenders  are
too young to be prosecuted!'' Or ``Girl, four, raped!'' Or  `Eleven  million
children in South Africa live in poverty!''

Police stastistics, and we have heard them  quoted  here  earlier  on,  show
that one in six rape survivors are younger than  12  years  old  and  nearly
half of them are under 18. In fact, it is much higher, as many incidents  of
sexual violence against children are not reported to  the  police.  Children
and  their  families  fear  being  disbelieved,   blamed,   intimidated   or
stigmatised.

City Press reports, and I quote:


  Education, children are made to believe, is the key to success.  But  not
  really for a learner of Makhosini Combined  School  in  Gauteng  who  was
  sexually abused and allegedly infected with the deadly HIV by her teacher
  last year. A young life ruined!

Our Constitution requires that  children  be  protected  from  maltreatment,
neglect, abuse or degradation.
In this Child Protection Week, South Africa should heed Mr  Skweyiya's  call
to put children first. However,  it  will  need  more  than  one  Minister's
slogan to put a  stop  to  this  immoral,  inhuman  and  indecent  abuse  of
children. It will need  all  the  resources  of  Government,  the  concerted
efforts of NGOs,  school  curricula,  the  teaching  of  churches,  the  co-
operation of the media and the mobilisation of parents if  we  are  to  have
any hope of halting this pernicious and demonic blot on our national life.

The  children   are   crying   out:   Love   us   don't   hurt   us.   [Time
expired.][Applause.]

Mrs P DE LILLE: Chairperson, I want to extend my condolences to  the  family
of Rudi Heine and to the DA. We are surely going to miss his  jokes  in  the
pub after work. May his soul rest in peace.

I want to say, hon Tsheole, that it's important that we do raise  the  issue
of statistics, because it must remind us all the time of  the  massive  task
ahead of us. It is in that context that  I  want  to  say  57%  of  all  our
children under the age of 17, and  over  a  quarter  of  the  South  African
population, live in dire poverty.

We need to tackle the structural problems  inherent  to  the  current  child
support grant. A recent report indicates that 75%  of  poor  children  below
seven years of age do not receive  the  child  support  grant.  Child-headed
households have no relationship  with  Government  and  receive  no  grants.
Poverty-stricken children over the age of seven receive no  support,  and  I
therefore welcome the Bill before Parliament to deal with  these  structural
problems.

We sit in Parliament debating  child  protection,  child  rights  and  child
abuse every year, while a great number of our  children  succumb  to  abuse.
Lip service is not enough. What we are doing here is  literally  paying  lip
service to the problems of our children. All  of  us  sit  here  and  debate
these issues that are so glaringly obvious and  then  retire  to  the  three
quarters of our lounges, to our safe homes and our secure houses. It is  not
enough in order to help and educate children.
We need the basic income grant now, not two  years  from  now.  We  need  to
extend the child support grant to all our children between the  ages  0  and
18. We need to simplify the child support grant procedures and we also  need
to make the child support grant available to the thousands  of  child-headed
households that have been left in the wake  of  Government's  reluctance  to
address the HIV/Aids pandemic. [Time expired.]

Ms H I BOGOPANE-ZULU: Mr Deputy Chair, I am just  going  to  be  very  brief
because I do believe that members are very tired. It will  be  an  injustice
and disservice to the children if I don't try  and  just  request  some  hon
members in the House to sometimes just take an opportunity  to  think  about
the children before we put forward their own political beliefs.

The hon Waters talks about the Child Protection Units. Yes,  we  agree  that
there are some inefficiencies, but it doesn't harm to  acknowledge  that  it
is this ANC Government that put those Child Protection Units in place.  When
it was you who were in government, you failed.  You  never  even  recognised
children.[Applause.] So it really does not harm at all, and  it  won't  harm
you to just once say ``well done''.

Regarding what the hon Nkabinde said, it has really been  helpful  in  terms
of the issues which she raised. However, it would have been  very  good  if,
as a mother and, I believe, coming  from  an  African  background,  you  had
given some solutions to the problems you  raised.  Women  are  really  doing
their best to protect children. They are  going  out  of  their  way  to  do
everything they can to ensure that children are protected.

However, sometimes we have our nice men  who  don't  seem  to  protect  even
their own children that they themselves brought into this world. I  am  just
trying to find our what the hon Minister should do. Should the hon  Minister
stop the men who abuse their own blood from having children? I am not  sure.
It would be interesting to hear.

With regard to what hon Van Jaarsveld raised, I am not sure if we do have  a
protocol on the rights of the child. I remember that we, last  time,  had  a
convention on the rights of the child, and we had  optional  protocols  and,
luckily, it is the responsibility of the committee that  I  am  chairing  to
remind Government about its international obligations. So there is  no  such
protocol from the UN that is called  the  protocol  on  the  rights  of  the
child.

The only outstanding protocol that  we  need  to  ratify  in  terms  of  our
obligations is the optional protocol on children in  armed  conflict.  I  am
not sure about the one that you refer to. It would be helpful if  you  could
get the correct name of the convention or the correct name of  the  protocol
you are  referring  to  so  that  we  can  ensure  that  we  facilitate  the
ratification, but the one that you refer to does not exist.

To Ntate Mogoba, it was very encouraging to hear  a  father  figure  talking
about what men are doing out there. I think we  should  really  congratulate
you and request that there be more men who will really begin to  get  morals
so that they don't behave like animals.

To hon Borman, thank you very much and we share some of your sentiments.  It
was very good to hear a mother speak without hearing her talking  about  the
stance of the DA, but sharing the sentiments of what we talk about  when  we
talk about child protection and the realities, and  having  a  South  Africa
that is fit for the children which we all wish to have one day.  Believe  it
or not, in respect of the inputs that you have made,  we  have  taken  note,
and we will try our best.

I am not sure whether it is correct, hon De Lille, to say that  child-headed
households are ignored by Government. We might  not  have  reached  all  the
child-headed households, but it is very important to acknowledge that  there
are special grants for child-headed households in the Department  of  Health
and in the Department of Social Development. It is acknowledged  that  there
might be problems in accessing the grants, but to  say  that  Government  is
completely ignoring child-headed households, I am not sure whether  that  is
correct or is a statement we can make today.

Deputy Chairperson, on 16 June 1994 President Nelson  Mandela,  after  being
presented  with  the  outline  of  the  National  Programme  of  Action  for
Children, reinforced Government's commitment to putting children first,  and
despite challenges,  we  are  still  striving  towards  that.  The  National
Programme of Action for Children is  a  holistic  programme  that  seeks  to
promote and protect the rights of children in South Africa.  It  provides  a
framework  through  which  Government  departments  put  into  practice  the
principles of putting children first. The challenges are  huge  but  we  are
getting there. Slowly but surely we are making big strides.

To ensure that we are on the right track to protecting the  rights  and  the
dignity of children - because it's not only  about  the  children's  rights,
it's about their dignity, too, which is a concept we tend to forget when  we
talk about children - the first aspect is to give  children  a  hearing,  to
give them the space to be listened to. I  believe  that,  through  the  many
campaigns that this Government has implemented, we  have  given  children  a
voice for the first time. We will continue to do so on  issues  that  affect
them, because we are implementing  Article  12  of  the  Convention  on  the
Rights of the Child, namely that children should have a say on  issues  that
impact on them. We have, in this Parliament on different occasions,  ensured
that we listen to children, which is one of the things for which,  I  think,
we as this Government should be applauded, because  it  has  never  happened
before.

We sincerely acknowledge the  challenges  that  the  National  Programme  of
Action face, but we acknowledge that we should be given credit where  credit
is due. Our National Programme of Action is the best in the world, not  only
because it is there, but because it brings  together  Government  and  civil
society for a common goal: to be able to make one  notion,  namely  that  it
takes a village to raise a child, a reality.

We have established nine provincial plans of action for children  which  are
established through the premiers' offices  and  are  tasked  with  the  same
responsibility  that  the  National  Programme  of  Action  is  supposed  to
implement. We do hope that, as we discuss and  deliberate  on  a  number  of
issues relating to children, the provinces will also be ensuring  that  they
enhance the issues that the provincial plans of action are supposed to do.

We have done a number of things to  attempt  to  raise  issues  relating  to
children. We have the documentary, A day in the  life  of  a  South  African
child, which was recently shown on television and which reminded us what  it
means to be a child in South Africa. We have radio talk shows for the  first
time for which all you need is a tollfree number that  enables  children  to
ask their leadership questions and to  be  able  to  make  inputs  into  the
issues. That  in  itself  is  about  making  sure  that  children  begin  to
participate in issues that affect them.

The issue of child abuse is a very sad and  a  very  thorny  issue  for  our
Government. Unless families begin to take the responsibility and  Government
meets us halfway, we might run the risk of not being able to win  that  war,
because we have done our  best  in  terms  of  amending  what  we  call  the
definition of a family from the narrow  definition  of  a  family  from  the
previous Family Act. We have gone out of our  way  to  acknowledge  domestic
violence and, unfortunately, a number of the child  abuse  cases  happen  in
the house, in the home. Are we now asking Government to provide  a  security
guard for every household? That really requires parents  to  begin  to  take
their own children seriously so that Government can then meet  them  halfway
in ensuring their protection, because it becomes one of those  things  which
you don't know how to deal with. Maybe the process of a  moral  regeneration
of society would assist us.

The other challenge for which I think we really deserve a pat  on  the  back
is that previously you would not even dare talk  about  child  abuse,  never
mind what happened in another household, never mind the neighbour  being  in
a position to report what happened to that particular child, because it  was
none of that person's business. We need to acknowledge the steps,  and  give
this Government credit where it is due.

Today we talk as if child abuse happened yesterday or  was  born  yesterday.
What is good is that we as a community and as a  society  are  beginning  to
talk about child abuse, which is something that we have never been  able  to
do in the past. So what has been on the increase is not the issue  of  child
abuse. What has been on the increase is the reporting of  child  abuse,  and
that has become an issue to be talked about as  it  is  something  we  never
dared talk about before. We need to at least  give  this  Government  credit
for that.

It has created an enabling environment and it's creating an environment  for
everybody to come forward, even for the neighbour  to  begin  to  interfere.
That never used to happen in the past. For  instance,  when  you  beat  your
child up, the neighbour can now take you to court.
Chairperson, I think we all need to acknowledge  that  a  number  of  things
have been done and, in all aspects, give  Government  credit  for  that.  As
South Africa, we are leading the world in the  reported  instances.  We  are
slowly but surely beginning to see serious prosecutions. In the past  years,
one would report child abuse, but one would  not  get  a  sense  of  whether
these cases got to court or not.

However, we are beginning to see that even our  judiciary  is  beginning  to
take issues of child abuse seriously, and  that  should  be  good  news.  It
sends a very clear message to perpetrators out there,  in  particular  those
of sexual offences and rape. One of the best  things  that  this  Government
has introduced is the definition of rape  and  acknowledging  that  children
are also being sexually violated. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:   Mr
Chairperson, thank you for this opportunity, and I would like to  thank  the
House for the debate. It is a really important matter that we have  come  to
discuss. The fact that this House has discussed it four times in  this  year
is probably an indicator of the extent of the problem.

I would like to thank the  hon  Saloojee  for  his  observations  about  our
obligations to meet the social and  economic  rights  of  children  and  the
potential cost related to that, and how we strive to meet the objectives  of
our Constitution, given the extent of  poverty  in  this  country.  He  also
makes the point that children's rights, as indicated  in  the  Constitution,
do not exist in isolation. It is the environments in  which  those  children
live that need to be improved, namely where they work, at school,  at  play,
in the home and in the community. The extent  of  the  problem  is  honestly
vast.

The allegation by the hon member Waters that  the  ANC  does  not  care  for
children is not only preposterous, it is highly inaccurate. Your efforts  on
the children's protection units are laudatory, but do not  imagine  for  one
moment that you bring us information that we did not have.  [Interjections.]
Why donS't you use your energy to become part of the solution,  rather  than
redefining the problem - a problem which, I might tell you, we  are  acutely
aware of and we do an enormous amount about.

Just a cursory inventory of the child-dedicated programmes  managed  by  our
Government represents a clear  indicator  of  Government's  serious  intent.
Here I would just like to name a few. The current review of the  Child  Care
Act, as you know, is  an  extensive  and  all-reaching  highly  consultative
process. Secondly, we have the consideration of the Child Justice  Bill,  an
incredibly well-prepared and costed piece of legislation, enjoying the  full
attention of no less than three committees in this Parliament.

Your information about additional  personnel  for  the  SAPS  is  incorrect,
because 445 people have been allocated to the  new  Child  Protection  Unit.
They will be allocated as soon as they have completed their training,  which
you indicated was so important, while 128  of  the  445  have  already  been
allocated. Furthermore, 71 additional vehicles have been allocated to  child
protection units by the SAPS.

School-feeding schemes sponsored by this  Government  attempt  to  meet  the
basic dietary requirements of learners throughout the  country.  Then  there
is free medical care to children under the age of  six.  The  Department  of
Social Development has registered 2,76 million children between the ages  of
nought and eight years. In addition,  National  Treasury  has  announced  an
incremental extension of this grant to children  up  to  14  years  of  age.
Foster care grants for children who are,  amongst  others,  victims  of  the
Aids pandemic and who have been orphaned are being increasingly provided  to
children across the board in this country. Legal Aid has set up a  programme
of assistance to help children to access their  social  benefits  rights.  I
could go on and on.

I will, just for the interest of the  House,  indicate  that  an  additional
R2,7 billion has been appropriated for courts and police to  streamline  the
justice process. This brings the total allocation  for  Justice  and  Police
Services to nearly R27 billion,  an  increase  of  10,98%  for  the  2002-03
budget allocation. I would like to suggest that this is  a  clear  indicator
of Government's intent to deal with this problem.

Victim empowerment programmes are being introduced  throughout  our  courts.
Infrastructure for sexual offences exist in 185 courts in our country.  Five
family courts pilot the new protocols in preparation for new legislation  on
the family law front. The Office of the Family Advocate operates to  execute
the Hague Convention mandate that they have and they work full  time,  often
under extremely  difficult  situations.  The  fact  regarding  the  domestic
violence legislation  is  that  people  in  literally  their  thousands  are
turning to the courts for remedy. We are aware that very often they have  to
wait for a very long time, but in increasing numbers every  year  people  do
see the courts as a solution.

The Department of Education has a dedicated programme  to  prevent  violence
in schools. The justice college has a full-time programme for  the  training
of members of the Police Force  and  the  justice  sector  on  the  Domestic
Violence Act, and this happens on an ongoing basis. I would like to  suggest
that just this cursory inventory of the  details  would  suggest  a  caring,
child-centred Government.

As regards the hon member Mbadi, the importance of values was stressed,  and
I agree that a return to the importance of the family as  protector  of  the
child is important. We as MPs, regardless of party affiliation, should  take
this message to our constituencies  and  advocate  for  its  propagation  to
every corner of this country.

The hon Van Jaarsveld made the observation that child abuse  is  everybody's
business, and we need to speak more freely about it,  because  it  is  still
true that the stigma of child abuse often prevents children from turning  to
people for help, even when it is available. South Africa's accedence  record
in respect  of  international  agreements  aimed  at  protecting  vulnerable
groups has been exemplary. For the hon Van Jaarsveld's interest,  I  have  a
list here of all of those we have acceded to, which is three pages long.  It
is an exemplary record. I will take up that matter, if you could  just  give
me the details. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is a  strong  proponent  and
advocate of children's and women's rights. I know that she would  roll  many
stones out of the way to assist us.

Hon Nkabinde, for the same reasons I have stated earlier, our policy is  not
lip service. Our action is a real indication  that  we  are  very  concerned
about these issues. I would like to reassure you that the SA Law  Commission
is examining legislation on  trafficking  in  order  to  protect  women  and
children. I just want to assure you, as I did the hon Waters, that it  would
be so much more welcome if you joined our processes to make our  efforts  as
a collective more effective. We are acutely  aware  of  the  extent  of  the
problem, and we spend  every  single  day  trying  to  improve  what  we  do
incrementally and on a sustainable basis. I urge you to engage  us  in  this
process and we will take the matter forward. Grandstanding  will  bring  you
no medals. [Interjections.]
Hon Tsheole, the importance of  understanding  that  the  expansion  of  our
services must be done in an incremental and sustainable manner is  essential
to this problem. If there was an instant solution to the existing  problems,
the ANC would snap it up right away. The integrated approach  that  we  have
set in place is bringing results and, if appropriately planned,  will  reach
greater and greater numbers of children each  year  on  an  incremental  and
sustainable basis.

I think I have covered just about all the points. The hon Bogopane-Zulu  and
the hon Mogoba made the  very  important  point  that  men  need  to  become
actively involved in this process. They need to join the ranks of  activists
out there and to stand up for the protection of children  and  not  tolerate
abuse in their communities. If they know somebody  who  is  doing  it,  they
must censure that behaviour and ensure that it does not happen again.

I thank you all for a very useful debate. We will take all your  suggestions
forward. Please join us in trying to  help  solve  the  problems.  Encourage
volunteers in your constituencies to assist where  there  are  gaps  in  the
services. We need all the help we can get. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  colleagues,  before  we  proceed
with the next order of the day, allow me to take this  opportunity  also  to
express my condolences and those of the House to the family of  Rudi  Heine.
We shall all miss him. May his soul rest in peace.

                       PUBLIC PROTECTOR AMENDMENT BILL

              (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee)

There was no debate.

Report adopted.

                       PUBLIC PROTECTOR AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
The DEPUTY MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Deputy
Chairperson and colleagues, the Public Protector is included  in  Chapter  9
of  the   Constitution,   dealing   with   state   institutions   supporting
constitutional democracy. These institutions operate independently  and  are
accountable to Parliament.

There have been arguments that the present appointment mechanism for  Deputy
Public Protectors, namely, that  they  must  be  appointed  by  the  Cabinet
member  responsible  for  the  administration   of   justice,   erodes   the
independence of that office as such  a  person  may  eventually  assume  the
duties as Public Protector. Consequently, the Public Protector requested  my
department to consider the possibility of amending the existing  appointment
mechanism. That request led to the  introduction  of  the  Bill  that  comes
before the House today.

Deputy Chairperson, as indicated in the memorandum on  the  objects  of  the
Bill, the main object of the Bill is to further regulate the appointment  of
the  Deputy  Public  Protector.  The  Bill,  however,  also  contains  minor
amendments relating to the Office of  the  Public  Protector  and  technical
amendments, bringing the terminology in  the  principal  act  in  line  with
recent developments.

Although we will not cover all the provisions  of  the  Bill  before  us,  I
think that it is important to mention some of  new  principles  relating  to
the appointment of the Deputy Public Protector, and which are  contained  in
the Bill. Firstly, provision is made for the appointment of only one  Deputy
Public Protector. Secondly, the Deputy Public Protector  will  be  appointed
by the President on the recommendation of the National Assembly ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Carry on, hon Deputy  Minister.
I am trying to get you a more receptive audience.

The DEPUTY MINISTER: Provision is  made  that  the  National  Assembly  must
recommend the person nominated by a committee of the National  Assembly  and
approved  by  the  National  Assembly  via  a  resolution  adopted  with   a
supporting vote of the majority of the members  of  the  National  Assembly.
Thirdly, the Deputy Public Protector will be  appointed  for  a  period  not
exceeding seven years, but he or she may, at the end of his or her  term  of
office, be reappointed for one additional term. Fourthly, the Deputy  Public
Protector may be removed from office only on  the  adoption  by  the  Nation
Assembly of a resolution calling for his or her removal from  office,  which
resolution should be adopted with a supporting vote of the majority  of  the
members of the National Assembly.

Chairperson, I have noted the contents of the portfolio  committee's  report
on the Bill and have already requested the  department  to  investigate  the
matter on an urgent basis. I think that all members  present  in  the  House
today recognise the important role  that  Chapter  9  institutions  play  in
strengthening and entrenching a human rights  culture  amongst  our  people.
These institutions also significantly  enhance  Government's  fight  against
corruption. It is for those very reasons that we must do everything  in  our
power to support and fortify those institutions in the important  role  that
they play.

Section 181(3) of the Constitution  also  provides  that  organs  of  state,
through legislative  and  other  measures,  may  assist  and  protect  state
institutions supporting constitutional democracy, the so-called  Chapter  9s
which include,  amongst  others,  the  Public  Protector,  to  ensure  their
independence, impartiality, dignity and effectiveness.

During  2001  Cabinet  entrusted   my   department   with   that   important
constitutional responsibility. We have accordingly  established  within  the
department a directorate that would  be  responsible  for,  amongst  others,
promoting  and  maintaining  communication  channels  between  the  relevant
Chapter 9  institutions  and  state  departments,  ensuring  that  proposals
emanating from and recommendations made in the  reports  of  the  Chapter  9
institutions receive the required attention, and  reviewing  and  evaluating
the existing budgetary processes and financial  arrangements  applicable  to
Chapter 9 institutions.
The Chapter  9  institutions  are  now  able  to  liaise  closely  with  the
department on any problems that they might experience and  which  they  feel
could have an  effect  on  their  independence,  impartiality,  dignity  and
effectiveness. I think this is a very favourable development.

I would like to thank the officials in  the  department  who  assisted  with
drafting this amendment. Thanks must once again go to the committee and  its
chairperson for their diligent consideration of this  legislation.  I  stand
in support of this Bill. [Applause.]

Adv J H DE LANGE: Deputy Chairperson,  I  rise  on  behalf  of  the  ANC  in
unconditional support of the Public Protector Amendment Bill.

Firstly, I wish to start off by conveying my  condolences,  personally,  and
on behalf of my party, the ANC, to the hon Rudi Heine's  family.  He  always
had a warm and a quick smile and he was always quick  to  crack  a  joke.  I
think we will miss him sorely in this House. May he rest in peace.
Many people have to be thanked for this legislation,  including  the  Public
Protector, that is the old one and the new one, and  various  other  persons
who have promoted this legislation. We  particularly  have  to  thank  Johan
Labuschagne in the department, as well as Barrington Mkhize,  his  superior,
for  being  able  to  lead  and  help  us  steer  this  legislation  through
Parliament.

As you are aware, when we drafted the Constitution,  we  followed  the  best
practices which were prevailing at that stage in  the  world  and  we,  like
other countries, created a whole host of institutions to  support  democracy
in this country. Many of  the  functions,  duties  and  responsibilities  of
these institutions previously used to be  performed  by  Government  itself.
However, the trend has been for many of these functions now to be  given  to
such institutions which are independent and are able to  oversee  Government
fulfil certain functions.

Obviously, in each country, the  form,  functions  and  responsibilities  of
these institutions vary. One such institution is the Public  Protector.  The
Public Protector in other countries usually takes the form of an  ombudsman.
In our country,  I  think  that  it  cannot  be  gainsaid  that  our  Public
Protector has been a tremendously useful institution in the few  years  that
it has been in existence, particularly with the limited resources  available
to it. It has particularly become a weapon for the poor  and  the  destitute
to get officials of Government to perform certain functions where they  have
been unwilling to do so, or  tardy.  The  mechanism  of  Public  Protector's
appointment, removal and suspension is fully spelt out in the Constitution.

A few  years  ago  we  also  created  the  possibility  that  Deputy  Public
Protectors may be appointed. At the time, there was much  debate  about  the
proper mechanism to do so. In the  end  the  committee  unanimously  decided
that it should be done by the Minister. We did so  particularly  because  we
felt that, if we also allowed the Deputy Public Protector  to  be  appointed
through a political process, then through Parliament, then  the  chances  of
persons rising through the ranks of the Public Protector  and  becoming  the
Deputy would be much smaller. Therefore, there would be less incentives  for
persons to join this institution because the  two  top  positions  would  be
filled through a political process.

However, the Public Protector has continuously felt  that  this  appointment
mechanism  could  create  the  perception  that  it  is   not   independent.
Government, instead of further arguing about this issue, has rather  decided
to therefore change the appointment mechanism in the future so  that  it  is
now almost identical to that of the Public Protector himself or herself.

I must add that the committee still has some hesitation as to  whether  this
is the right route to follow. But, we have felt that,  at  the  end  of  the
day, if the Public Protector keeps  on  motivating  and  arguing  for  this,
particularly in public, we should not stand in  the  way  of  changing  this
matter  and  allowing  the  deputy  to  be  appointed  through  a  political
parliamentary process. We just hope that this does not  inhibit  persons  to
join and to stay on in the Public Protector once  they  are  there,  because
they feel that their promotion opportunities are limited.  I  am  sure  that
only time will tell.

I also want to thank all the parties in the committee. We have  passed  this
legislation unanamously. It's again through hard work  and  compromise  that
we were able to sort out  all  the  technicalities.  Thank  you  very  much.
[Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Mr Deputy Chair, this  amending  Bill  seeks  to  introduce
requirements applicable to candidates for  the  position  of  Deputy  Public
Protector. In  addition  thereto,  the  Bill  intends  enabling  Members  of
Parliament with more than 10 years experience to be suitable candidates  for
election to both the position of Public Protector, as well as Deputy  Public
Protector.

As you are aware, the DA opposed the appointment of Mr  M  L  Mushwana,  the
previous Deputy Chairperson to the NCOP, during the course of last  year  on
the basis that he was an ANC MP, elected by his ANC colleagues  by  majority
decision from the party to which he belongs, the ANC.

By introducing legislative measures to facilitate the appointment of MPs  to
the Office of the Public Protector and Deputy Public Protector, the ANC,  as
the ruling party, is displaying all the arrogance and contempt  for  dissent
that has come to characterise its tenure in government.

The Office of the Public Protector is  a  Chapter  9  institution  in  terms
whereof the independence of those institutions is to be protected. No  steps
should be endorsed by Parliament to systematically  erode  the  independence
of an institution such as the Public Protector's Office. The appointment  of
serving ANC MPs as Public Protectors to protect the interests of the  public
against the Government of which he was a member of the  ruling  party,  does
not create an image of impartiality which is required of  officials  serving
in   an   independent   institution   such   as   the   Public    Protector.
[Interjections.]

It should go without saying that the appointment of  MPs,  particularly  ANC
MPs, is utterly inappropriate as MPs are active  party  politicians  with  a
particular  view  toward  Government,  be  it   in   opposing   Government's
questionable actions or by acting in support of those actions of  Government
by virtue of his or her political affiliation.

These positions require  the  incumbents  to  be  responsible  only  to  the
Constitution and the law. The public need to be able to trust the  integrity
of institutions designed  to  protect  their  interests.  The  international
community, including the community of investors, needs to believe  that  the
future of our constitutional democracy is  safe  and  that  no  action  that
erodes the supremacy of the Constitution will be tolerated.

This development is quite clearly another addition to a litany  of  intended
ANC cadre deployments and interferences in independent institutions such  as
the Public Protector by stealth, I wish to add.

It is to be noted that no other  requirements  are  stated  for  members  of
Parliament to become the Public Protector or the  Deputy  Protector,  except
the requirements of being a fit and a proper person. No legal  qualification
or experience is required. An MP with  no  legal  background  whatsoever  is
therefore able to be elected to a position requiring a proper  understanding
of legal issues,  in  particular  the  legal  and  socioeconomic  rights  of
members of the public against  the  Government  which  is  alleged  to  have
contravened his or her rights.

One can ask why are MPs  afforded  special  mention  in  the  Bill.  Let  me
provide you with an answer: It is the ANC's stated policy that it wishes  to
extend hegemony over the state and civil society. This is not paper  policy.
Almost everything the ANC does is designed  to  close  down  the  space  for
independence from the ruling party and its agenda.

Ten spyte van bogenoemde aspekte verskaf hierdie  wetsontwerp  'n  meganisme
ingevolge waarvan 'n formele proses gevolg moet  word  waardeur  'n  komitee
van die Parlement die aangewese  Adjunk  Openbare  Beskermer  moet  aanstel,
soortgelyk aan die proses wat gevolg moet word  om  die  Openbare  Beskermer
aan te stel.

Op grond van, onder meer, hierdie oorweging, en gesien in die  lig  van  die
feit dat die Adjunk Openbare Beskermer in die verlede deur die Minister  van
Justisie aangestel kon word sonder die voorgestelde proses,  ondersteun  die
Demokratiese  Alliansie  hierdie  wetsontwerp.   Ek   dank   u.   [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In spite of the above-mentioned aspects, this Bill provides a mechanism  in
terms of which a formal process must  be  followed,  according  to  which  a
committee  of  Parliament  must  appoint  the   designated   Deputy   Public
Protector, similar to the process that  must  be  followed  to  appoint  the
Public Protector.

On the basis of, inter alia, this consideration, and in  the  light  of  the
fact that in the past the Deputy Public Protector could be appointed by  the
Minister of Justice without the proposed process,  the  Democratic  Alliance
supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr T E VEZI: Chair, the main objective  of  the  Bill  is  to  regulate  the
appointment of the Deputy Public Protector. The 1994 principal Act  provided
that the Cabinet member responsible for the administration of justice,  that
is, the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development,  could  appoint
Deputy Public Protectors. However, it was  felt  that  the  provision  could
lead to the erosion of the  independence  of  the  Public  Protector  as  an
institution. The amending Bill therefore provides  that  the  Deputy  Public
Protectors will in future be appointed by the  President,  and  not  by  the
Cabinet Minister.

During its deliberations, the portfolio committee noticed  that  a  term  of
office for Deputy Public Protectors was  not  specified.  After  reflection,
the committee decided to insert a term of office and agreed  that  it  would
be for a maximum of seven years, renewable only once.
The committee also decided to provide in the  Bill  for  the  suspension  of
Deputy Public Protectors from office by the President after the  institution
of an investigation or inquiry. It also decided to  include  that  a  person
who had been a Member of Parliament for a cumulative period of at  least  10
years  may  be  considered  as  a  candidate  for  the  position  of  Public
Protector.

The IFP supports the Public Protector Amendment Bill.  The  Bill  also  does
well in regulating the term of office of Deputy Public Protectors and  their
suspension and removal from office.

However, there is a concern that a former  member  of  Parliament  would  be
able to  become  a  Public  Protector.  This  could  possibly  erode  public
confidence in the institution, as it would create doubts in the public  mind
as to the neutrality of a former party politician. I thank you.

Sepedi speech follows.)

[Mr M J MALAHLELA: Hon members! Let me  start  by  saying  that  members  of
Parliament visited Cuba after  the  advent  of  our  new  democracy.  During
conversations at dinner with their host, they asked each other  about  their
political affiliations. Some of us said our  political  party  was  the  one
that fought for South Africa's freedom. We were asked which freedom were  we
fighting for, because we were free. Which freedom  were  we  talking  about,
because we were able to visit them as we were free?

We are talking about all this as we want to let our  people  understand  who
we are; where we come from; and about our future.  The  further  explanation
is that when the comrades met in 1955 in  Kliptown,  they  all  agreed  that
``the people shall govern''. It was not out of boredom, but it  was  because
they were fighting for freedom. On 27 April 1994  South  Africa  met  again,
and said that the people should govern! But not anybody  could  govern;  the
African National Congress was to govern - the organisation  of  people  like
Moses Mabida and uncle Kotane.

When we took power, as an organisation of the  people,  we  understood  that
during the freedom struggle we learnt that when  we  say  the  people  shall
govern, we mean as in passing the Bill before us today that we  should  have
the Office of the Public Protector as we are the only ones in the know;  and
we understand people because there is no division between us.  So,  it  must
be understood that as an  organisation  that  says  that  the  people  shall
govern, as they voted for us, we come back to give  them  power  to  govern,
and it is only those people who can come to us and  say  we  do  not  govern
properly. We only have a problem with laymen who come  and  say  we  do  not
govern properly while they know nothing about power, as  it  is  the  people
who said we should govern. Now, we plead with the laymen to behave,  and  be
governable, as it is nice to be governed. [Applause.]

When we give people the power to govern through the  Office  of  the  Public
Protector, we do that because we learnt something from  the  criticism  that
was made by one of the Chilean leaders, Volodya Teitelbaum,  who  showed  us
that when you are in  power,  you  should  create  a  space  for  people  to
participate so that they continue to give you power.  That  is  what  people
will do next year.
We thank many liberation movements who made sure that we are here  today  to
pass Bills like this and say, let the  people  govern.  We  thank  men  like
Carlos Fonseca and Daniel Ortega of Sandanista National Liberation Front  in
Nicaragua, because they taught us things, some of  which  made  it  possible
for us to be here.  We  thank  movements  like  Farabundumadi  and  Barasine
Nasion of El Salvador, because they taught us that people and movements  are
not to be separated. Give people the power and have an office of the  Public
Protector, like this one! [Applause.]

We thank people like General von Guan Jian, governor of Vietnam, who  showed
that if there can be a division between people and  the  government,  people
will rise against us and end up taking back the power they invested in us.

The men that I am talking about were not laymen, but  freedom  fighters.  We
thank men like Colonel Thomas Sankara of Burkino Faso who  said  that  South
Africa would also one day be free, whereby once the people  have  the  power
to govern, the African National Congress will also take power  back  to  the
people.

As the organisation of the African National Congress, we  support  and  pass
the Bill to have  the  Deputy  Chairperson  in  the  Office  of  the  Public
Protector because it is we who know what the people are; it is we  who  know
how the people should be cared for; and it is we who  gave  the  people  the
power! I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Miss S  RAJBALLY:  Thank  you,  Deputy  Chair.  With  our  first  democratic
election and  proud  compilation  of  our  national  Constitution  came  the
establishment of the Public Protector. Bearing its duty and mission  in  its
title, the Public Protector will assist Parliament  as  an  independent  and
impartial body in investigating any conduct  in  state  affairs  or  in  the
public administration and its spheres of government. The MF feels  that  the
existence and operation of the state institutions supporting  constitutional
democracy, such as  the  Public  Protector,  is  sincerely  encouraging  and
beneficial to the South African state. The MF feels that the reduction  from
two Public Protectors to one Public Protector is a  concerning  factor,  and
one wonders whether that will be sufficient.

The amendment is made in this Bill to update certain absolute provisions  to
further regulate the appointment of the Public Protector.  The  MF  supports
the amendment. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Deputy Chairperson and hon members, ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, order! Proceed, hon member.

Mr G B MAGWANISHE: Indeed, Deputy Chairperson, the ANC is  gradually  moving
us away from our painful past, a past full of misery  and  sorrow,  full  of
violence and hatred. Today we do not need to  stand  here  and  justify  why
thousands of people have been in prison without trial. Today we can  proudly
stand before the nation to pass a law, and to restore dignity to  all  South
Africans.

The Bill before us today is part of the ANC's programme to deepen  democracy
and promote a culture of human rights in our country.

We  in  the  ANC  believe  that  institutions  that  support  constitutional
democracy should be supported and capacitated so that they are able to  meet
their constitutional obligations and better the lives of our people.  Unlike
some people who think that power is glamour, as the ANC we have a  programme
and we think that power is an instrument that should be  used  to  implement
that programme which is about pushing back  the  frontiers  of  poverty  and
restoring dignity to our people. Our people are starting to use  the  Office
of the Public Protector to exercise their rights, and  that  Office  of  the
Public Protector has been equal to the task.

I am, however, concerned about  the  abuse  of  the  Office  of  the  Public
Protector by some political parties in this House, like the DA.  The  DA  is
using the Office of the Public Protector to fight its own political  battles
when they have been defeated in the proper  battlefield,  and  that  is  the
highest form of cowardice. It is  important  that  we  respect  institutions
that we have created, because if we don't, who will? In  dealing  with  this
Bill, we have  established  a  very  clear  and  transparent  process  which
clearly outlines how the Deputy Public Protector shall be appointed.  He/she
shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation  of  the  National
Assembly.

We have also set out criteria which befit that  position,  namely  that  the
person who is going to be the Deputy Public Protector  must  be  a  fit  and
proper person to hold such an office. He must be a judge of the  High  Court
or he must be qualified to be  admitted  as  an  advocate  or  attorney  and
should have accumulated experience over a period of at least 10 years  after
becoming qualified.

Let me also take this opportunity to thank Advocate Selby Baqwa,  our  first
Public Prosecutor, for a job  well  done.  I  would  also  like  to  welcome
Advocate Mushwana  as  our  new  Public  Protector  and  wish  him  well  in
fulfilling his new responsibilities.

On behalf of the ANC, I would like to support this Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT:  Thank  you,
Deputy Chair. Before I proceed, I would  like  the  members  of  the  DA  to
convey my condolences and those of my Minister to the family and friends  of
Rudi Heine. May his soul rest in peace.

I would like to thank the House for the debate in which the  discussion  was
restricted to the topic at hand. It seems that there was general  consensus.
I just need to reiterate what the last speaker said, and  that  is  that  we
really give this Office and the institution as much support as  we  can.  It
is very important. They are doing an enormous amount of work on literally  a
shoestring budget. Issues of resourcing do need to  be  dealt  with,  but  I
believe that the addition of a  Deputy  will  assist  the  Public  Protector
enormously in his/her work.

I would like to thank everyone for the debate, and I thank, once again,  the
officials who worked with us and also thank the committee for their  effort.
Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

The House adjourned at 18:52.
