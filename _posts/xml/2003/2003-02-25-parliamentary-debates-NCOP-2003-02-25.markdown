                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the  civil  war  in  the  Sudan,  which  started  in  1955,
           continues and that some two million Sudanese have been butchered
           by the Northern Sudanese forces over this period;


       (b)  the hope held out by the Machakos Protocol of July 2002, entered
           into between the government of the Sudan and the Sudan  Peoples'
           Liberation Movement/Sudan People's Liberation Army;


       (c)  that after a halting start and many violations, the  process  is
           still on track; and


       (d)  that the churches and their international partners  are  holding
           the annual Assembly of  the  Sudan  Ecumenical  Forum  in  South
           Africa from 23 to 27 February, they  are  sitting  now,  shortly
           before the Sudan peace negotiations begin again in Nairobi. They
           will discuss, inter alia, breaches  of  the  cease-fire  by  the
           government of the Sudan that have come to light; and


  (2) calls upon the Government of South Africa to  encourage  the  parties
       concerned to stay within the agreement and the spirit of the Machakos
       Protocol, and to steadfastly endeavour to bring peace,  order  and  a
       newly agreed upon constitutional order to the Sudan,  which  responds
       to their needs, including those of the majority of the people in  the
       South  of  Sudan  to  the  right  of  self-determination,  tested  by
       referendum in future.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK:  Voorsitter  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting van die Huis sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) daarvan kennis neem dat die Noord-Kaapse Wetgewer hierdie week  open,
       en dat die nuwe Wetgewergeboue van die  Noord-Kaap  in  Kimberley  in
       gebruik geneem gaan word;


  (2) kennis neem dat, hoewel die Nuwe NP van mening is  dat  die  kapitaal
       vir die gebou sinvol vir armoedeverligting en werkskepping  aangewend
       kon word, dié party nogtans die vertroue uitspreek dat -


       (a)  die fasiliteite wat geskep is, sal bydra tot beter dienslewering
           aan al die mense van daardie provinsie;


       (b)  die tolk- en vertaaldienste daar die taalregte van die Afrikaans-
            Xhosa- en Tswana-gemeenskappe van die provinsie sal respekteer;


       (c)  die provinsie spoedig 'n eie talewet sal aanvaar; en


       (d)  die Premier van die Noord-Kaap met die opening van die gebou  en
           die Wetgewer, anders as in die verlede, in sy  openingsrede  aan
           al die tale en kulture van die provinsie erkenning sal gee; en


  (3) voorts daarvan kennis neem dat die Noord-Kapenaars trots is op  hulle
       herkoms, en dit nie wil vertrap hê deur eentaligheid nie.

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I hereby give  notice  that  on  the  next
sitting day of the House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Northern Cape Legislature is  opening  this  week  and
       that the new Northern Cape Legislature buildings in Kimberley will be
       taken into use;


  (2) notes that, although the New NP is of the opinion  that  the  capital
       for the building could have been meaningfully  utilised  for  poverty
       alleviation and job creation, this party  nonetheless  expresses  the
       confidence that -


       (a)  the  facilities  that  have  been  created  will  contribute  to
           improved service delivery to all the people of the province;


       (b)  the interpreting  and  translation  services  will  respect  the
           language rights of the Afrikaans, Xhosa and  Tswana  communities
           of the province;


       (c)  the province will soon adopt its own languages Act; and


       (d)  with the opening  of  the  building  and  the  Legislature,  the
           Premier of the Northern Cape will, unlike in the past, recognise
           all the languages and cultures of the province  in  his  opening
           address; and


  (3) further notes that the people of the Northern Cape are proud of their
       heritage and do not want it trampled on by monolingualism.]

       thorough professionalism;

       showcasing to billions all over the world the beauty and  the  beasts
       for which South Africa  has  become  world  famous  to  international
       tourists; and
  (3) places on record the sincere appreciation and gratitude of all  South
       Africans to the  three  host  nations  of  Kenya,  South  Africa  and

       singularly spectacular role in the ongoing proceedings.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chair, I want to propose an amendment to  the
previous motion, and then I do have a motion without notice.  The  amendment
is the following:


  That the following paragraph be added after paragraph (3):


  (4) wishes South Africa well and believes, with confidence, that our team

       thorough professionalism;

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the passing away of Banoo N Ginwala at the age  of
       94 on Sunday, 23 February 2003. The late  Banoo  N  Ginwala  was  the
       mother of the Speaker of the  National  Assembly,  Comrade  Dr  Frene
       Ginwala, and Khorshed Ginwala, the former South African ambassador to
       Italy;
  (2) also notes the activism of the late Banoo  Ginwala  who,  among  many
       other  things,  provided  shelter,  accommodation  and  resources  to
       members of the liberation movement in South Africa while she  was  in
       Mozambique;


  (3) further notes the  sense  of  values  that  she  has  imbued  in  her
       children, and in a daughter who now occupies a seat  in  the  highest
       institution of this land: Parliament; and


  (4) is of the view that, in the Speaker of the National Assembly and  the
       Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, we  find  the  same
       kind of steadfastness and the characteristic resilience that the late
       Banoo Ginwala had shown - they are people who have been influenced in
       a particularly distinctive way by their mothers and by  the  kind  of
       care and support that they had received, people who now occupy  these
       very important seats with remarkable integrity,  remarkable  capacity
       and skill; and


  (5) wishes to convey its sincere  condolences  to  the  Speaker  and  her
       family in their sad bereavement.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               PENSION PAYOUTS TO WIDOWS OF DECEASED POLICEMEN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die mediaberig  in  Rapport  van  23  Februarie  2003
       waarvolgens geen uitbetalings ten opsigte van die pensioene van  wyle
       inspekteur Pine Pienaar en wyle sersant Charles Dlamini, wat albei op
       3 Julie 2002 in Memel in die Noordoos-Vrystaat  doodgeskiet  is,  nog
       aan hulle weduwees gedoen is nie;
  (2) voorts kennis neem  dat  beide  die  oorlede  polisiemanne  ook  jong
       kinders  nagelaat  het  vir  wie  se  kos,  kleding,  huisvesting  en
       opvoeding hulle weduwees nou verantwoordelik is;


  (3) ook kennis neem dat, as gevolg van die feit  dat  nog  geen  sodanige
       pensioenbetalings gedoen is nie,  beide  weduwees  nou  'n  desperate
       stryd voer om in hulle en hulle  kinders  se  noodsaaklike  daaglikse
       behoeftes te voorsien; en


  (4) die Minister van Veiligheid en Sekuriteit versoek om -


       (a)  dringend ondersoek te  laat  instel  na  waarom  daar  nog  geen
           pensioenuitbetalings ten opsigte van hierdie twee  oorlede  lede
           gedoen is nie;


       (b)  te reël dat  daar  intussen  voldoende  finansiële  en/of  ander
           materiële bystand aan die weduwees en kinders van  hierdie  twee
           oorlede lede verleen word;


       (c)  ondersoek te laat instel na die situasie van die afhanklikes van
           ander polisielede wat oor die afgelope drie jaar  in  diens  van
           die SA Polisiediens gesterf het, om sodoende vas te stel of daar
           soortgelyke gevalle is; en


       (d)  die Raad so spoedig moontlik van 'n verslag  na  aanleiding  van
           die voormelde versoeke en daaruit voortspruitende ondersoeke  te
           voorsien.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) takes note of the article in Rapport of 23 February 2003 according to
       which no pension payouts have as yet been made to the widows  of  the
       late Inspector Pine Pienaar and the late  Sergeant  Charles  Dlamini,
       who were both shot and  killed  on  3  July  2002  in  Memel  in  the
       northeast Free State;


  (2) further takes note that both the deceased policemen also left  behind
       young children for whose food, clothing, accommodation and  education
       their widows are now responsible;


  (3) also takes note that as a result of the fact that no pension  payouts
       have been made, both widows now wage a desperate struggle to  provide
       for the essential daily needs of their children and themselves; and


  (4) requests the Minister for Safety and Security to -


       (a)  launch an urgent investigation as to why no pension payouts have
           as yet been made with regard to these two deceased members;
       (b)   arrange  that  sufficient  financial  and/or   other   material
           assistance be provided in the interim to the widows and children
           of these two deceased members;


       (c)  launch an investigation into the situation of the dependants  of
           other police members who have died over the past three years  in
           the service of the SA Police Service, to by so  doing  determine
           whether there are other similar cases; and


       (d)  provide the Council with a report as soon as  possible  pursuant
           to the above-mentioned requests and investigations arising  from
           them.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      POLICY OF MULTILINGUALISM ADOPTED

                             (Draft Resolution)
Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad kennis neem van die feit dat -


  (1) die kabinet verlede week 'n beleid van veeltaligheid aanvaar het;


  (2) dít 'n groot stap in die ontwikkeling van veeltaligheid is;


  (3) Suid-Afrika die wêreld voor is wat beleid oor meertaligheid betref en
       dat nog net die  Europese  Unie  (met  groter  finansiële  vermoë  en
       mannekrag-reserwes) al so iets aangepak het; en


  (4) Suid-Afrikaners rede het om optimisties te wees en saam  te  werk  om
       die tegniese implementering van die beleid te laat slaag.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Ms E C Gouws: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes the fact that -


  (1) Cabinet last week adopted a policy of multilingualism;


  (2) this is a big step in the development of multilingualism;


  (3) South Africa is ahead of the rest of the world concerning a policy on
       multilingualism and  that  only  the  European  Union  (with  greater
       financial capability and manpower reserves) has undertaken  something
       like this; and


  (4) South Africans have reason to be  optimistic  and  to  work  together
       towards the successful technical implementation of this policy.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I would like to get clarity on  whether  it
is parliamentary for a member to quote another member in  tabling  a  motion
in the House. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): If he refers  to  what
another member has said, there is nothing unparliamentary about that.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                   CONTROL OF CHOLERA IN THE EASTERN CAPE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnu H T SOGONI: Sihlalo, ndenza isiphakamiso ngaphandle kokwenza isaziso:


  Sokuba iKhansile -


  (1)  iyithabathele  ingqalelo  into  yokuba  isifo   sorhudo   singxamele
       ukugabadela kwimimandla ethile yeMpuma Koloni;


  (2) ngokwengxelo yamajelo eendaba esi sifo sesisube imiphefumlo  eliqela,

       sibe nokuncothulwa neengcamu.
(Translation of isiXhosa draft resolution follows.)

[Mr H T SOGONI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  [That the Council -


  (1) notes that cholera is getting out of control in  some  areas  of  the
       Eastern Cape;


  (2) notes that according to media reports the disease has already claimed
       many lives and that more than a thousand people in the O.R. Tambo and
       Chris Hani Districts are receiving treatment for the disease;


  (3) expresses its appreciation of the contribution  and  intervention  of
       the Departments of Water Affairs  and  Forestry,  of  Health  and  of
       Defence in bringing temporary relief during this critical situation;


  (4) notes that the cause of all this is unclean water  and  the  lack  of
       toilets in the rural areas; and


  (5) pays attention to plans to bring water and sanitation services to the
       rural areas that are subjected to abject poverty, in order to prevent
       further outbreaks of this disease.]

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, could somebody translate for  us  before
we  vote  on  it?  All   of   us   could   unfortunately   not   understand.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  an
interpreting service? If there is somebody,  I  can  allow  that  person  to
translate the motion. Is there somebody in the interpreting  booth?  We  are
not going to vote on that motion now as we still have another motion.  We'll
get somebody who can give us a translation, and then we will  come  back  to
that motion.

                     EARTHQUAKE IN THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter  scale
       that brought about untold devastation and  misery  in  the  lives  of
       thousands of people from the region of Xinjian  in  the  Republic  of
       China;


  (2) conveys its heartfelt condolences to those 257 families who have lost
       members and those thousands who were  injured  and  are  still  being
       treated in hospitals; and


  (3) congratulates the sterling efforts of rescue workers who have  combed
       and continue to comb tirelessly through the rubble of more than 1 000
       buildings which were  flattened  in  the  earthquake,  for  survivors
       despite the risk to themselves.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Can we go back to  the
motion we  did  not  vote  on?  Is  there  a  translation  for  the  motion?
[Inaudible.] I suggest that we proceed. We are not going to wait  for  this.
Mr van Niekerk, do you insist on a translation before we vote on  this?  You
can read it in the Hansard.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, if we cannot get a translation  now,  which
is pitiful, an explanation of the gist of the  motion  would  enable  us  to
vote on it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Mr Sogoni,  would  you
mind just briefly giving us the crux of your motion?

Mr H T SOGONI: Chair, the motion is about cholera, which has  hit  parts  of
the Eastern Cape  very  badly  during  the  past  few  weeks.  According  to
sources, over 1 000 people are being treated for cholera and quite a  number
of people have died. We appreciate the role that the  Departments  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry, of Health and of Defence have played  to  contain  the
disease. We are aware that the source  of  cholera  is  primarily  unhealthy
water and a lack of sanitation. A plea is made  that  clean  water  services
and the provision of sanitation take priority if  we  are  to  contain  this
disease. Sorry about this.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Can I suggest that  in
future, when members want to move a motion in  a  different  language,  they
arrange with the Table staff to provide an interpreting service, because  we
are now delaying the proceedings of the House.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, excuse  me,  I  understand  what  you  just
said. I just want clarity on it. You said: ``If a member wants  to  table  a
motion in any other language''. ``Other'' language that what?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Well,  we  know,  for
example, that English and Afrikaans are being provided for.  Those  services
are  readily  available.  But  at  times  interpreting  services  for  other
languages - African languages - are very scarce in  Parliament.  So  members
need to make prior arrangements  in  that  regard  in  order  to  make  this
service available.
Mr H T SOGONI: Chair, with due respect, may I know why there is  no  regular
provision for the translation of the other languages,  besides  English  and
Afrikaans?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE COUNCIL  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Well,  I  have
already said that  we  have  a  shortage  of  these  people.  Parliament  is
addressing that problem. That is why I was suggesting that  if  we  let  the
Table staff know, they can make prior arrangements.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Chairperson, my understanding of a motion without  notice
is that you do not have ample time to give notice of such a motion,  and  my
view is that this would then go against the grain of how we define a  motion
without notice.  With  our  last  predicament,  during  which  I  personally
volunteered to  interpret  a  motion  without  notice,  we  were  given  the
understanding and the commitment that it was at that time going  to  be  the
last time we encountered such an instance. So if  we  could  stick  to  that
commitment, it will allow our proceedings to run smoothly.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I think the point  has
been made made and it is taken. I think we need to address that.  Thank  you
very much, hon member.

   INFRASTRUCTURE AS A TOOL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, WITH REFERENCE TO
     COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND OTHER PUBLIC WORKS INITIATIVES

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS:  Hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members  of  this
House, let me start off by explaining my approach  to  this  topic.  As  you
listen to what I have to say, you will note that I  will  move  beyond  that
which is community based. I will do so because  of  the  President's  recent
announcement in Parliament that nowadays we speak not just narrowly  of  the
former community-based programmes, but also of  the  expanded  Public  Works
Programme. So don't be surprised by my approach, because I  want  us  to  be
focused for the future.

The National Infrastructure Investment Report indicated  that  South  Africa
currently faces a backlog in infrastructure of at least R170 billion.

Public  infrastructure  needs   include   both   domestic   and   industrial
infrastructure.  This  includes  everything  that  is   within   the   built
environment such as buildings of all types, bridges,  roads,  dams,  railway
lines, airports, stations,  monuments,  telecommunications  and  electricity
infrastructure; as well as agricultural water  supplies,  sanitation,  waste
water and storm water. Also included  is  infrastructure  related  to  urban
housing, rural  development,  hospitals,  clinics,  educational  facilities,
courts, police stations, prisons - the list is endless.

We find that within the three spheres of government, we,  as  Public  Works,
have to deal with all of them, except in areas where  you  talk  about  that
which is within Transport, Minerals and Energy, Agriculture and so forth.  I
mention these different types of infrastructure so that when you talk  about
the backlog in infrastructure, you actually  realise  the  enormity  of  the
task ahead of us and what it is that we have to do.

Investment, development and progress in all these areas  will  actually  add
to the quality of life  in  communities.  At  the  same  time,  it  will  be
building what we call ``productive economic capacity''.  For  instance,  the
provision of basic household infrastructure, in particular, is a  relatively
low-cost and effective form of public intervention in favour  of  the  poor,
and it is consistent with the reduction in income inequalities.

Initiatives in the future are going to be taken to align  certain  areas  of
infrastructure,  especially  public   social   infrastructure.   Nationally,
housing subsidies, land development grants, local  transport  upgrading  and
community water supply and sanitation schemes are  being  aligned  with  the
municipal  infrastructure  programme.  In  provincial  governments,  through
which  funds  are  allocated,  criteria  for  priority  spending  are  being
defined.

Members have seen through the Community-Based Public Works  Programmes  that
we have created a number of assets,  and  some  of  that  infrastructure  is
infrastructure that deals with issues of social cohesion. In addition,  what
we do is also incorporated in the spatial development  initiative  in  which
economic  infrastructure  is  upgraded  to  ensure   that   we   also   have
participation by the private sector.

Investment in social infrastructure might start  with  what  appears  to  be
small issues like a crèche or a clinic, but can move on to  huge  structures
such  as  maximum  security  prisons,  some  of  our  courts,  universities,
airports and harbours. However, what is important for  us  to  note  is  the
impact all of this infrastructure has on the lives of our  people,  and  the
creation of an environment suitable to our investors.

We know for a fact that no serious investor would want to invest in an  area
where  there  are  no  roads  and  electricity,  and  where  the  system  of
communication is very poor, let alone where there is no sure water supply.

At times we get very funny arguments - I want to raise this issue  -  as  to
why, together with Correctional Services, we are  putting  up  the  type  of
infrastructure we are in terms of prisons. The truth of the matter  is  that
you can't talk about rehabilitation in squalor. Cognisance must be taken  of
the fact that a prisoner will one day rejoin the community, and the  chances
of his reverting to crime will be minimised if he  is  taught  skills  while
still in prison in order to equip him with knowledge to make  him  a  better
member of the community.

I am sure Minister Skosana has told you time and again  about  the  type  of
furniture that is now made in prisons. It is the envy of even  some  of  the
best furniture manufacturers. He has also told you about how they deal  with
some of their land so that the person who comes  out  of  prison  is  highly
skilled and can become an acceptable member of society.

Members have already been told about some of the Government programmes  such
as electricity and water supply and so forth,  which  are  really  making  a
difference to the lives of our people. At this point I will also  take  note
of the motion I just heard and will convey the message to my colleague.

Our Government spends billions on national and provincial  roads,  which  at
times do have private funding.  In  the  Department  of  Public  Works,  for
instance, we have the Apops programme for the building of prisons  in  terms
of which the  private  sector  invests  and  also  runs  the  prisons,  with
Government paying  an  amount  for  rental.  That  actually  frees  up  some
Government money in order to deal with issues of a social nature.

To  make  sure  that  infrastructure  becomes   a   tool   for   sustainable
development, we must face  some  of  the  challenges  that  are  there,  for
instance, our widespread poverty. We know that many millions of  people  are
surviving below the minimum living level in South Africa. Of these,  several
million are in the rural areas. For instance, if you judge  by  the  cholera
incident that really took place in places like the  Eastern  Cape,  then  it
becomes important that we look at how and what we bring to those areas.

That is why, of late, if you speak to anyone from that area  they  will  say
that their first priority is water supply and sanitation. Although  we  have
committed to numerous  projects  and  have  progressed  admirably  with  the
supply of potable water to millions of people who previously  did  not  have
adequate access, basic living conditions impede poverty relief. The  problem
escalates when housing, education and health care  facilities,  as  well  as
transport and other factors, are considered.

Nevertheless, the Government is committed to basic levels of  infrastructure
development, which will reduce the burden of  poverty  in  rural  areas  and
allow rural people to use their time more productively  and,  by  so  doing,
contribute to national growth.

As the President said: ``The tide has turned.'' When I deal with  Community-
Based Public Works projects, I can say  with  a  smile  that  the  tide  has
turned. If you look at some of our multipurpose centres,  we  have  actually
created infrastructure of a socially cohesive nature.

In the heart of  KwaZulu-Natal  the  elderly,  work-seekers  and  those  who
wanted to apply for ID documents, but who did  not  have  money  to  travel,
used to have to travel some 80 kilometres each way. But a  miracle  happened
when we established multipurpose community centres  which  bring  all  those
facilities closer to the people. It now takes only a short walk for  makhulu
MaMkhwanazi to apply for a passport or an old age pension. It takes  a  very
short time for Joyce to get a form to see what jobs are available. It  takes
a very short time even for mama Makhathule in Lusikisiki  to  apply  for  an
ID. That is infrastructure that has  been  created  to  make  the  lives  of
people very easy.

Also, with regard to the Community-Based Public Works Programme, as  I  said
in this House some time back, we  cannot  afford  to  neglect  some  of  the
infrastructure which was created in another era  but  which  has  value  for
those areas, especially infrastructure to  do  with  the  former  irrigation
schemes. We have started reviving those so that instead of their  being  run
directly by Government, they will end up being  given  to  communities.  The
communities will, within their own right, have a  centre  of  investment.  I
could take the whole day listing what it is that we  do,  but  I  wanted  to
give those two examples.

A  lot  of  people  associate  economic  growth  with  stronger   employment
creation. I want to say that for us the  key  is  to  have  economic  growth
continually moving towards an equitable distribution of income and  improved
standards of living for all.

Provision of social infrastructure has important externalities,  which  have
an impact on economic growth. Direct poverty  alleviation  addresses  needs,
and  does  not  only  benefit   those   people   involved   through   direct
remuneration. It also contributes to the building  of  long-term  productive
capacity and general human resource development.

I will touch on this aspect, because at no point  do  we  in  Public  Works,
when we are putting up a big structure, say that all the labourers  must  be
brought in from outside the community. We make  sure  that  the  people  are
employed within the community, using the  Department  of  Labour,  which  is
very helpful. We, at least, say that those people must  be  trained  for  45
days either in carpentry or painting and in other aspects that  have  to  do
with the building of a structure.

Therefore when the company finishes its work you still have  people  in  the
community with the know-how to  deal  with  issues  of  maintenance  and  so
forth. This is going to be required even  more  in  what  we  as  Government
envisage for the future.

After all, the whole issue of  Government  wanting  to  have  this  expanded
Public Works Programme is not only to create jobs, but also to  ensure  that
those engaged are given the capacity to perform. This is  because  if  there
is one thing that is bad, it is to throw money at people when they  have  no
capacity to use it. That's like throwing gold at pigs.

The overall objective of this Government  programme  is  to  facilitate  and
create employment opportunities for the poor, the vulnerable  and  alienated
groups through integrated and co-ordinated labour-intensive  approaches.  We
are lucky in the sense that we have a stepping stone, because  in  the  1995
framework agreement between business, labour and  Government  on  conditions
of employment  and  skills  development,  a  foundation  was  laid  for  the
expanded Public Works Programme.

This agreement took recognition of the fact that infrastructure  development
is the key driver of economic growth and social development,  with  outcomes
that lead  to  job  creation,  poverty  eradication  and  income  generation
through  an  approach   of   labour-intensive   methods   of   construction,
development and maintenance.

This is going to be a key area in which even you, as members of this  House,
have to take an initiative. There are no people who know their areas  better
and the  programmes  that  can  be  dealt  with  in  their  areas  than  you
yourselves.

One of the sad happenings of the past was that  we  put  up  infrastructure,
and members of Parliament would just pass by  and  say:  ``Ooh,  this  is  a
white elephant.'' They don't tell us immediately, but go: ``Sh. Go and  see;
there's trouble there.'' It just becomes a story over tea.  Then,  when  one
goes on one of these tours, it is then that you raise  something  which  has
been there and which you were seeing all the time.

So I want to implore you this afternoon to work together  with  us.  If  you
see that something is going wrong, inform us almost immediately so  that  we
can do something about it. This is  because  there  is  nothing  as  bad  as
Government throwing money at something, only to find that people were  never
consulted - the structure that was built was not aligned to their  needs  at
a particular time.
When we deal with this expanded programme, what we want to do is, as I  have
said, to focus on labour-intensive  technology,  community  involvement  and
the creation of  work  opportunities.  We  are  also  looking  at  what  the
outcomes of this will be. First there is alignment,  which  I  have  already
spoken about, and also the fact that participants  will  receive  on-the-job
training. But we are also emphatic in that specific opportunities should  be
given to women, the youth and the disabled  by  targeting  these  vulnerable
groups and making sure that they participate.

Above all, we set up infrastructure that will create useful  public  assets,
which will provide for social improvement and  facilitate  participation  by
microenterprises, especially by emerging contractors.

I want to deviate  a  little  here.  Again,  regarding  issues  to  do  with
infrastructure, we talk of a group we  call  ``emerging  contractors'',  and
this is a term that worries me. It is going to be our  tenth  year,  yet  we
are still talking about ``emerging contractors''. For  how  long  will  they
continue to emerge?

In the battle  of  ensuring  that  they  also  become  part  and  parcel  of
development and growth, we must make sure that  we  get  mentors  for  these
people so that we don't get a situation in which one  says:  ``This  is  the
big company; the shareholding by the  minor  companies  is  10%.''  This  is
because in most cases that shareholding will just be a farce.

I am told that somewhere  along  this  coastline  some  people  had  fishing
rights which they sold for R25 000. The people to whom they sold the  rights
must have made millions. The word ``emerging'' does create a problem.  There
must be encouragement from  you  and  you  must  make  sure  that  when  big
business steps in, even if it is in construction, you emphasise  that  these
people be given a chance to grow. This is so that in the near future we  can
just talk about people in construction, not people who are emerging.

Yes, I know that right through life there will always be new  entrepreneurs,
but there is something about ``emerging'' which somehow says that  you  must
stay out there and you will emerge forever, as if this is a  nice  title  to
have.

Also, when we talk about the public infrastructure we have, we are  actually
talking about the nature of the delivery. The  nature  of  the  delivery  is
something that we also have to be on the lookout for.  I  always  say,  even
when I have a press briefing, that there is nothing  that  worries  me  more
than the fact that, owing to a lack of capacity, we don't  have  people  who
watch closely while programmes are dealt with and that  we  don't  have  the
type of managers at times who are prepared to say, ``This  is  a  job  badly
done,'' and who make sure that we don't pay  for  that  job.  But  for  some
reason infrastructure gets certificated and we pay the people - in  June  it
is a good road; in December it is one of the  worst  roads  one  would  ever
come across. I think that as members of this House you must begin to be  the
eyes and ears of Government.

I would like to round off by referring to information that is listed in  the
speech we prepared. In 1999 we created a total of 80 000 temporary  jobs.  A
total of 33 970 women were employed; a total of 32 977 youth were  employed;
and a total of 2 011 disabled people were employed. We  created  over  2 000
assets for communities. You must remember that  we  are  talking  about  one
department only. It would be quite interesting if we had a  full  complement
of what is happening in all the other departments.

We deliberately gave  R100  million  for  construction  projects  by  women,
because they are always left out when the big people  start  to  tender  for
projects. In some of our projects, which took  place  in  27  districts,  we
made sure that we trained 150 managers. Also, we made sure that  we  trained
about 90  people  who  at  times  work  as  contractors,  but  who  are  not
recognised because they have not been accredited and  whose  prior  learning
is not recognised. At one time it was said that Cape Town had  no  plumbers,
but once we had put people through a few  weeks  of  training  we  had  them
accredited and recognised as plumbers.

Given all this, it is clear that the expanded  Public  Works  Programme  has
the potential to offer much more impressive employment  and  human  resource
development, provided we all put our shoulders to the wheel and  engage  the
private sector as a participant. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms  B  THOMSON:  Chairperson,  what  do  we  mean   when   we   talk   about
infrastructure  as  a  tool  for  sustainable  development?   Infrastructure
development within a  sustainable  development  context  is  about  holistic
thinking. It is about social and economic infrastructure  development  based
on proper management of environmental  resources  for  the  preservation  of
future  generations.  As  the  ANC,  we  are  committed  to  promoting   and
delivering social  and  economic  infrastructure  which  both  enhances  the
quality of life of our people and preserves infrastructure  for  generations
to come.

Kubalulekile ukukhumbula ukuthi uma  lezi  zakhiwo  zakhiwa,  ngeke  sihlale
siyizintombi sinjengo-Beauty nezinsizwa lezi. Ngelinye ilanga siyoguga  sibe
amakhehla  nezalukwazi.  Kuyofunakala  ukuthi-ke  isizukulwane  esilandelayo
sikwazi  ukuzibona  lezi  zakhiwo  esizakhile.   Kubalulekile   ukuthi   uma
sezakhiwe siqaphele ukuthi siyazigada futhi  sizinakekele.  (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[It is important to remember that these buildings were built.  We  will  not
remain ladies like Beauty and these gentlemen. One day we will get  old  and
become old grannies and grandfathers. The next generation will need  to  see
these buildings that we have built. It is important to look after them  once
they have been built.]

The Integrated Rural Development and  Urban  Renewal  Strategies  articulate
our vision for an integrated and sustainable approach around  infrastructure
development. It provides a coherent framework  for  infrastructure  delivery
in a sustainable way. The key requirements for the practical  implementation
of these blueprints for social and economic development  in  the  identified
nodal points are community involvement and effective co-ordination.

Sizokhumbula ukuthi  lezi  yizizinda  ezakhonjwa  uMongameli  wethu,  uThabo
Mbeki,  okuhloswe  ngazo  ukuthi  kuzanywe  ukubhekelela  abantu  abahlwempu
kakhulu. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[We will remember that these are areas that were  chosen  by  our  President
Thabo Mbeki, and the aim is to use them for the benefit of the poor.]

Communities will  have  to  be  brought  on  board.  Municipalities  and  in
particular ward committees need to create  the  kind  of  environment  which
will facilitate community involvement  and  encourage  communities  to  take
ownwership of their own development.

The two main objectives of community participation must be  to  ensure  that
infrastructure development projects deliver what  the  community  needs  and
that the community establishes a sense of  ownership  and  commitment  which
will ensure its long-term sustainability.

Kufuneka sikuqaphele-ke nokuthi, uma lezi zakhiwo zakhiwa, ngabe  umphakathi
sisuke siwuthintile yini ngaphambi kokuthi sakhe. Kufuneka siqaphele  ukuthi
singakhi ihholo kanti umphakathi udinga isikole  noma  sakhe  isikole  kanti
umphakathi udinga umgwaqo ngoba lokho kuholela  ekutheni  umphakathi  ungabi
nokuziqhenya ngokuthi leyo  ngqalasizinda  esuke  ilethiwe  kungeyawo  ngoba
phela vele wona ubungazange waba nenhloso yokuthi yakhiwe.  (Translation  of
isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[We also need to look at whether we have consulted the community  before  we
build these buildings. We should be careful, for instance, not  to  build  a
hall while the community needs a school. And also  not  to  build  a  school
while the community needs a road because that leads  to  a  situation  where
the community is not proud of those  buildings  which  are  theirs,  because
they were not their priority number one.]
Infrastructure projects  must  therefore  become  instruments  of  community
empowerment. For this, they need to to be sustained,  and  for  them  to  be
sustained they need to be maintained. This raises the important question  of
who  should  be  responsible  for  the  maintenance  and   preservation   of
infrastructure. Is it the  national  Government,  the  provincial  or  local
government, or a combination of the three?

Siye sikubone nokuthi lokho kuba yinkinga  lapho  uthola  uhulumeni  wendawo
ekhomba  owesifunda  kuqhubeke  njalo   njalo.   Ngicabanga   ukuthi   lokho
kukhombana kufuneka siqaphele ukuthi siyakugwema ngoba uthola ukuthi  omunye
ukhomba omunye ehlweni nomunye azame ukuvikela elakhe  ihlo.  Kuye  kufuneke
kucace ekugcineni ukuthi kahle kahle ubani okunguyena oqondene nokuthi  lezi
zingqalasizinda zigadwa  kanjani  uma  sezakhiwe.  (Translation  of  isiZulu
paragraph follows.)

[We have also seen that usually it creates problems when a local  government
blames a provincial government and so on.  I  think  we  should  avoid  that
situation of blaming one another  because  one  finds  that  one  person  is
blaming the other and the other is defending him or herself. It needs to  be
clear as to who is in charge of ensuring that these buildings are  protected
once they have been built.]

Local government is at the coalface of  interaction  with  the  communities.
They are the primary implementation agencies. As such, they will have a  key
responsibility in terms of the delivery of infrastructure, as  well  as  for
its maintenance to ensure that it remains  sustainable  for  use  by  future
generations. However, they will need the  continued  support  of  provincial
government and the national Government in this task. What is called  for  is
thus a co-ordinated approach in which the three spheres of  government  work
together.

Akufunakali sithi uma sesimlethile  lo  mntwana  emhlabeni,  oyihholo,  bese
sithi  akazibonele  njengechwane  lenyoka  ngoba  yikhona  lokho  okubangela
ukuthi ubone nezindlu sezigugile  ezinye  sezilala  izinkomo  ngoba  asinalo
uhlelo oluhleleke kahle, noma  lukhona  asilunaki,  mayelana  nokuthi  ubani
owenza ukuthi nokuthi  emuva  kokuba  uHulumeni  omkhulu  eseyilethile  leyo
ngqalasizinda endaweni. (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Once we have given birth to this child, which is the hall,  we  should  not
say to her that she should look after herself, like a baby  snake.  That  is
the reason why some of these buildings get  dilapidated  or  become  like  a
cattle kraal; it is because we do not have a proper  plan.  Even  if  it  is
there, we do not follow it properly, like saying: Who does  this  and  that,
once  the  national  Government  has  brought  the  infrastructure  to  that
particular area.]

The need for effective co-ordination is  based  on  the  understanding  that
national and provincial departments are in charge of policy-making,  leaving
implementation to local government. A lack of proper co-ordination runs  the
risk of  creating  a  gap  between  the  more  abstract  demands  of  policy
formulation and the practical challenges of implementation, resulting  in  a
distancing of policy processes from the  challenges  experienced  at  ground
level.
How can we best ensure that  co-ordination  between  the  three  spheres  of
government around infrastructure development and  maintenance  takes  place?
Municipalities will have to make sure that their infrastructure  development
initiatives are incorporated in the Integrated Development Plans, the  IDPs,
and are also in turn aligned with the  provincial  and  national  strategies
and plans.

The budgetary basis of the IDPs is  an  ideal  framework  to  operationalise
infrastructure  development  strategies,  in  the  sense  that  it  will  be
mainstreamed into the normal activities of  municipalities.  Also,  it  will
ensure that the strategies are underpinned  by  institutional  capacity  and
budget allocations.

Similarly, the alignment of IDPs with  provincial  and  national  strategies
will ensure  that  local  infrastructure  development  initiatives  will  be
mainstreamed  into  the  normal  activities  of  provincial   and   national
government,  and  underpinned   by   institutional   capacity   and   budget
allocations.

The benefit of  such  a  co-ordinated  approach  is  that  it  combines  the
prerequisites for holistic development with an acute  understanding  of  the
need for appropriate institutional structures to ensure that  infrastructure
initiatives are implemented. More than that, it ensures that  infrastructure
development initiatives are linked to financial resources.

The  need  for  a   co-ordinated   approach   to   the   implementation   of
infrastructure development projects cannot be stressed enough. Lack  of  co-
ordination is one of the biggest constraints in the  effective  delivery  of
services. One can take health services for example. It  is  quite  difficult
to build a clinic if there is no other  infrastructures  such  as  roads  or
water. The improvement of  roads  would  facilitate  delivery,  by  enabling
contractors to reach the site where the clinic must be  constructed  and  to
transport materials to such a site.

One can use a similar example of a school that needs  to  be  built  by  the
Department of Public Works. Even if  the  school  is  built  it  will  serve
little purpose if  the  Department  of  Education  does  not  make  adequate
provision for teachers or learning materials. Perhaps the  school  does  not
have adequate recreational facilities, resulting in pupils preferring to  go
to schools outside the area where these facilities are available.

Uma ngingase ngibuze nje lapha eNdlini ukuthi mangaki  amalungu  ePhalamende
anezingane ezifunda lapho ehlala  khona  uyothola  ukuthi  zincane  kakhulu.
Esikhundleni   sokuxazulula   lezo   zinkinga   esiye   sizibone   ezikoleni
ezingasemakhaya, asikwenzi lokho.  Siye  sincamele  ukuthi  abantwana  bethu
sibafake    ezimotweni    sibase    ezikoleni    ezingaphandle     ezinalezo
zingqalasizinda.  Ngibona  ukuthi  lezo  yizinto   okufuneka   silwe   nazo.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[If I can ask this House how many members of Parliament  have  children  who
enrol in schools that are in their own  communities,  one  would  find  that
there are very few. Instead of solving the problems  that  we  have  in  the
schools around us in our communities, we do not do it. Instead we  take  our
children by car to schools which are outside our  communities,  where  there
is good infrastructure. I think that these are the  things  that  we  should
fight against.]

These  examples  illustrate  the  importance  of  co-ordination  among   the
Departments of Transport, Public Works, Health and  Education.  However,  it
also  provides  an  opportunity  for   the   formation   of   public-private
partnerships.  Public-private  partnerships  offer  local  government,   the
private sector, nongovernmental organisations and the  local  community  the
opportunity to work together to improve infrastructure  provision  in  needy
areas. For such co-operation to be successful, it will have to  be  properly
co-ordinated to remove some of the constraints such as the  bureaucracy  and
red tape which  tend  to  delay  the  implementation  of  projects  in  some
municipalities.

Proper co-ordination, whether it is between the three spheres of  government
or  in  respect  of  public-private  partnerships,  avoids  duplication.  It
creates  a  common  focus,  integrates  planning  and  speeds  up  efficient
delivery.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  member,
your time has expired.

Ms B THOMSON: Ngiyabonga. [Thank you.] [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Mnr die Voorsitter,  die  lewering  van  infrastruktuurdienste
soos die verspreiding van elektrisiteit, die  lewering  van  'n  effektiewe,
betroubare vervoerstelsel, die voorsiening van water en sanitasie,  die  bou
van skole en klinieke en die lewering  van  gesondheidsdienste  van  'n  hoë
standaard is  van  die  belangrikste  faktore  om  'n  voortgesette  gesonde
ekonomie in enige land te ontwikkel en in  stand  te  hou.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairperson,  the  delivery  of  infrastructural  services
such as the distribution of  electricity,  the  delivery  of  an  effective,
reliable transport system,  the  provision  of  water  and  sanitation,  the
building of schools and clinics and the delivery of  health  services  of  a
high standard is one of the most important factors to develop  and  maintain
a continued healthy economy in any country.]

Providing these  services  to  meet  the  demands  of  all  households,  the
business sector and  civil  society  is  one  of  the  major  challenges  of
sustainable economic development and growth.

I am aware of the fact that the Government has allocated  billions  of  rand
for spending on infrastructure. I  am  also  aware  of  the  fact  that  the
Government has initiated many community development programmes, inter  alia,
the rural strategic plan to provide for infrastructure to the  rural  areas,
for which we are very grateful.

The  Consolidated  Municipal   Infrastructure   Investment   Programme   was
initiated to address the need for investment in  water,  sanitation,  roads,
storm water, energy and solid waste removal infrastructure in  disadvantaged
areas. The funding, however, is allocated partially on a  provincial  basis,
and delivery is normally the responsibility of local  government.  There  is
no clear indication of the manner in which  this  is  being  undertaken.  It
would be a great pity if the R3,3 billion that has  been  allocated  to  the
Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure Investment Programme's fund since  the
inception of the  CMIP  was  not  spent  in  toto  on  the  various  project
categories that have been initiated.

I say this because it is quite alarming to learn  from  the  report  of  the
Auditor-General on  the  financial  statements  of  Public  Works,  for  the
financial year ending 31 March 2001, that there  were  serious  shortcomings
in the department's system of internal control and that overall control  was
seriously weakened owing to the shortage of appropriate skills  and  a  high
staff turnover. As Public Works is  playing  such  a  pivotal  role  in  the
creation and building of the necessary infrastructure for the  country,  one
can only hope that most of these shortcomings  were  overcome  in  the  past
financial year.

If one takes into consideration the  huge  backlog  in  the  funds  for  the
provision and maintenance of infrastructure, spelt out by the  hon  Minister
here today, it is quite clear that the spending of existing  funds  must  be
controlled very strictly.

The effective transportation of people and goods is a basic requirement  for
healthy economic and social development in South  Africa  and  Africa  as  a
whole. As enablers of development, roads are seen  as  essential  components
of the South African transport  system  and  one  of  the  most  significant
investments by the country in its transport infrastructure.

According  to  the  Department  of  Transport,  it  is  grappling  with  the
sustainability  and  with  the  deterioration  of  the  South  African  road
network. Currently, the department is spending R3,3 billion  annually  below
the required levels needed to preserve our road network.

It is the responsibility of the Government in the national,  provincial  and
local spheres to see to it  that  the  transport  infrastructure,  including
road and  rail  networks,  harbours,  airports  and  pipeline  systems,  are
established  and  maintained  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and   restore
imbalances between geographic regions and communities.

Mnr die Voorsitter, die opvoeding van ons kinders is van  die  allergrootste
belang. Sonder genoegsame  skole  op  die  regte  plekke  is  dit  egter  'n
onbegonne taak. Die beplanning van  woongebiede  moet  nie  net  voorsiening
maak vir behuising nie, maar moet ook  voorsiening  maak  vir  die  bou  van
skole en die voorsiening van parke en oop ruimtes en gesondheidsdienste.

Dit gebeur nog te veel dat skole op verkeerde plekke gebou word en waar  dit
broodnodig is, word dit nagelaat. Dit bevorder  verseker  nie  die  skepping
van 'n klimaat waarin ons kinders met trots en waardigheid  kan  studeer  en
opgroei nie. Ek was ontsteld om onlangs in Die  Volksblad  van  28  Januarie
hierdie jaar te lees van die haglike omstandighede waarin leerders  onderrig
moet ontvang by Mmabana skool in Wesselsbron in die Vrystaat. Agthonderd  en
twintig  leerders  word  in  nege   klein   klaskamers   en   18   sinkhutte
geakkommodeer. Ek haal graag aan uit die berig  wat  die  skoolhoof  in  dié
verband gesê het. Me Hellen Sanqai sê:


  Deur  -  en  vensterlose  klaskamers  maak  omstandighede  by  die  skool
  ondraaglik. In die winter is die klaskamers soos yskaste en in die  somer
  is dit warm en  vol  stof.  Leerders  wat  skool  bywoon,  het  nie  eens
  toiletgeriewe nie en moet  in  skooltyd  na  toilette  by  huise  in  die
  omgewing gaan.

Hierdie skool is reeds ses jaar gelede in gebruik geneem. Dit is net nog  'n
bewys dat daar 'n gebrek aan goeie beplanning is, want in  sekere  dele  van
die Vrystaat staan skole wat  onlangs  gebou  is,  leeg.  Beter  koördinasie
tussen departemente is beslis nodig  in  hierdie  verband.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr  Chairperson,  the  education  of  our  children  is  of  the   greatest
importance. However, without enough schools in the right places this  is  an
impossible task. The planning  of  residential  areas  must  not  only  make
provision for housing, but should also make provision for  the  building  of
schools and the provision of parks and open spaces and health services.

It is still too often the case that schools are built in  the  wrong  places
and are not built where they are desperately  needed.  This  certainly  does
not promote the creation of a climate in which our children  can  study  and
grow up with pride and  dignity.  I  was  upset  to  read  recently  in  Die
Volksblad of 28 January this year about the terrible conditions under  which
learners have to be taught at Mmabana school  in  Wesselsbron  in  the  Free
State. Eight hundred and twenty learners  are  accommodated  in  nine  small
classrooms and 18 galvanised iron huts. I will quote from the  article  what
the school principal said in this regard. Ms Hellen Sanqai said:


  Deur-  en  vensterlose  klaskamers  maak  omstandighede  by   die   skool
  ondraaglik. In die winter is die klaskamers soos yskaste en in die  somer
  is dit warm en  vol  stof.  Leerders  wat  skool  bywoon,  het  nie  eens
  toiletgeriewe nie en moet  in  skooltyd  na  toilette  by  huise  in  die
  omgewing gaan.

This school was already put into service six years ago. This is yet  further
evidence that there is a lack of good planning, because in certain  sections
of the Free State schools  which  have  recently  been  built  are  standing
empty. Better co-ordination between departments is certainly needed in  this
regard.]

It is, however, very encouraging to hear what the hon  Minister  of  Housing
had to say about this in a parliamentary media briefing on 20 February  this
year. I quote:


  The  President's  announcement  of  new  urban  renewal  and   integrated
  sustainable rural development  programmes  in  a  number  of  cities  and
  villages across the country set down a huge new challenge for all  of  us
  in housing at the national, provincial and local government  levels.  And
  not in housing alone, because the integrated nature of  these  programmes
  means that we must work together with our  sister  departments  across  a
  range of big intervention areas.  Housing's  pivotal  role  in  achieving
  these goals is clear. Creating a secure and healthy  housing  environment
  within  upgraded  and  well-integrated  communities   demands,   however,
  sustainable and affordable municipal services and health services.

I would like to conclude by ... [Time expired.]

Thank you, Mr Chair. [Applause.]

Mr M  A  SULLIMAN:  Deputy  Chair,  apartheid  created  a  system  of  large
disparities between racial groups  in  terms  of  employment  opportunities,
education and housing. I know that many of us in this House would  not  like
to hear this but it is a fact. The effects of this system are still  present
today.

The poor suffer not only from an absolute lack of key assets, such as  land,
education, skills and health, but also face limited choices with respect  to
livelihood strategies. Strengthening and supporting the assets of the  poor,
whether human, physical or social, help to counter  their  vulnerability  to
poverty. Expanding infrastructure development  has  multiple  objectives  of
providing  poverty  relief,  development  and  income  generation,  and   it
empowers the poor.

The need to expand economic infrastructure in its own right  has  been  used
simultaneously to fight poverty throughout Asia, Africa and  Latin  America.
The rationale is that government capital spending can  be  used  to  improve
the productivity and earning power of poor  people  and  their  assets,  for
example,  by  providing  access  roads  to   markets   or   irrigation   for
agriculture. Such projects form part  of  strategies  of  poverty  reduction
that attempt to alleviate high and persistent levels of unemployment  and  a
lack of infrastructure, particularly in the deprived rural communities.

Expanding  infrastructure  via  labour-intensive  strategies  helps  in  the
eradication of poverty in two ways. Firstly, it  provides  paid  employment;
and, secondly, it creates things that poor people can use to increase  their
ability to generate income.

Am I protected, Deputy Chair? There is a lot of disturbance behind me.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Hon  members,  can  we
give each other a chance to debate please?  It  would  be  good  for  us  to
listen. Continue, hon member. You are protected.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: The benefits of expanding infrastructure  by  all  national
departments - from Public Works to Health,  Education,  Transport,  Housing,
and Water Affairs and Forestry - and through all  corresponding  departments
at provincial levels reach the very poor communities.

In the light of this, I will demonstrate the  experience  of  our  province,
the Northern Cape. The Northern Cape has completed  the  following  examples
of Community-Based Public Works Programmes for the 2002-03  financial  year.
There is the example of the building of a  multipurpose  hall  in  Pescodia,
Kimberly. The contract was awarded  as  a  joint  venture  between  a  local
historically disadvantaged  company  and  an  established  company,  and  it
created jobs for our people.

Another example is the building of a crèche in Louisvale in which  39  local
people were employed for a period of about five months. In  Paballelo  there
is the construction of access roads  in  the  townships  amounting  to  R1,9
million. This project is being done in conjunction with the municipality  to
identify  the  workforce  and  in  order  to  participate  in  the   project
management thereof. There has also been  the  R12  million  funded,  labour-
intensive project  on  cleaning  the  sides  of  our  provincial  roads  and
widening our roads. Local people were trained and made  to  carry  out  this
work themselves, and 855 people were employed during the  2002-03  financial
year. It is expected that these people will remain  employed  for  the  next
financial year.

In addition, a new legislature building was built last  year.  The  official
opening of  our  new  legislature  building  will  take  place  this  coming
Thursday, and we expect about 10 000 visitors at the ceremony. This  project
employed 869 people. The main contractors in  this  project  were  Murray  &
Roberts and  the  Cape  Builders  Forum  with  an  equity  share  of  60:40%
respectively,  while  55%  of  the  subconstruction  was  awarded  to  local
historically disadvantaged people.

Members of this House must bear in mind that  the  legislature  building  is
near Galeshewe, a low-income residential area. Therefore,  the  construction
of the legislature in  our  province  has  huge  income-multiplying  effects
since it is physically well placed to provide  employment  to  the  adjacent
residential areas. The multiplying  economic  benefits,  such  as  increased
employment opportunities, are not incorporated in the numerical cost of  the
building of the legislature.
The province is in the process of establishing a  new  administration  block
through a private-public partnership. The successful or preferred bidder  is
expected to have no fewer than than 40% of his  or  her  partners  from  the
historically disadvantaged. The provincial department  of  public  works  is
also managing building projects on behalf of the other  departments  in  our
province, and 80% of all these projects are given to SMMEs.

Public works in  our  province  has  engaged  aggressively  on  an  emerging
contractors' development programme. The programme is designed to  assist  in
identifying potential small contractors and to build  a  database  of  them.
Each contractor will be mentored and monitored until  they  advance  to  the
stage  at  which  tenders  can  be  obtained  for   projects.   Seventy-five
historically disadvantaged  companies  have  been  registered;  22  of  them
comprise women and 15 of them comprise  the  youth.  Moreover,  since  April
2002 the provincial department of public works  in  the  Northern  Cape  has
awarded 36% of all  projects  to  women-owned  contracting  firms.  In  rand
terms, this amounts to just more than R9 million.

In addition, a 30% women-owned company completed two projects  totalling  R6
million within six months. One of the projects is a one-stop service  centre
in Colesberg and the other is a multipurpose hall in Kimberley.

Finally, members of this House must note that fighting  poverty  is  not  an
event but a process. We do not expect to reduce poverty at the tip  of  this
continent by  the  mere  institution  of  a  few  Public  Works  programmes.
However, we take solace in the knowledge that no other  government  of  this
country, except the ANC-led Government,  has  had  the  political  will  and
courage to make a modest start.

With these few remarks, I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr N M RAJU:  Hon  Deputy  Chair,  hon  Minister,  hon  colleagues,  at  the
recently held World Summit on Sustainable Development in  South  Africa  the
overarching  theme  was   the   link   between   poverty   eradication   and
environmental degradation.

Among the many challenges that emerged at the summit  were  challenges  that
are especially relevant to South African  society,  namely  inspiring  local
projects that address poverty, and the empowering of women and the youth.  I
notice, very gladly so, that the hon Minister in  her  introductory  remarks
referred to all three of these subjects and to what the  Ministry  is  doing
to address that situation.

In the Standard Bank Group report:  An  Economic  Profile  of  South  Africa
2002, Dr Iraj Abedian, Director and Group Economist, states:


  The Achilles heel  of  the  social-economic  environment  has  been,  and
  remains, unemployment. Even here, it might be argued that the  conditions
  are as much about ``unemployability'' as about employment.

We cannot run away from the fact that the South African economy in both  the
public and  private  sector  is  dogged  by  the  shortage  of  skilled  and
knowledgeable workers. Considerable numbers of vacancies continue  to  exist
in these sectors of our economy. The DP concurs with the assertion  made  in
the Standard Bank report that  the  unemployment  of  skilled  personnel  is
exacerbated  by  the   ``foot-dragging   in   introducing   an   appropriate
immigration policy to facilitate skills importation'' to  boost  growth  and
job creation.

Skills development, capacity-building and support programmes  are  essential
ingredients for infrastructure development in any sphere  of  activity.  The
hon Minister has already referred to the  kind  of  infrastructure  that  is
required in our communities,  especially  in  the  rural  communities,  when
applications are made for grants and ID documents, to  register  births  and
deaths, and so on.

When the NCOP had its sitting in the Eastern Cape  last  year,  we  came  to
understand first-hand some of the frustrations and problems  experienced  by
the people, especially in the rural areas. So we understand  and  appreciate
the concerns that the hon Minister has referred to.

The hon President of the Republic, Thabo Mbeki, has alluded  to  the  yeoman
tasks undertaken by the Letsema volunteers  who  have  set  an  example,  in
various initiatives, to  ensure  that  the  frontiers  of  poverty,  however
formidable, continue to be pushed back.  The  spontaneous  response  of  all
South Africans - the high and the mighty, the rich and the poor,  the  abled
and the disabled, both men and women, the aged and the young - to  the  call
of Vukuzenzele must be applauded. This idea of volunteerism is  yet  another
manifestation of the spirit of ubuntu: I am, because you are!

During the American civil rights movement in the 1960s - the  Kennedy  years
- when Afro-Americans were  engaged  in  a  relentless  struggle  for  human
rights, freedom and justice, leaders like Martin Luther King, Malcolm X  and
others called upon Afro-Americans not to look for hand-outs  but  to  buckle
down, pull themselves up by their bootstraps and regain  their  dignity  and
respect.
Former British Prime Minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher  once  berated  her
fellow citizens for being a nation of ``moaning minnies''. In  South  Africa
it is an immense challenge to reconstruct a country ravaged by a history  of
racism, with its concomitant aspects of denial and  neglect.  But  from  the
ashes  of  apartheid  the  phoenix  of  self-respect,  dignity   and   self-
sufficiency must rise triumphantly, for sure.

However, the necessary infrastructure has to be put  in  place.  Communities
need to involve themselves in putting in  place  the  infrastructural  tools
for sustainable development. The building of  schools,  clinics,  hospitals,
old age homes, childcare centres and the like makes up the physical face  of
a wholesome community. Public Works initiatives are part and parcel  of  any
action plan to eradicate poverty and restore  dignity  to  those  living  in
unfortunate circumstances.

Early last year the Select Committee on  Public  Services  of  the  National
Council of Provinces undertook a study tour of Thailand.  One  of  the  many
projects of an infrastructural nature was a visit to  the  Rom-Klao  housing
project, in the district of Bangkok.

The housing project is a semicompleted new town  established  to  solve  the
housing shortage problems in the Bangkok  metropolitan  area  for  the  low,
middle and high-income groups. Some of the public facilities  and  utilities
included electricity, water supply,  septic  tanks,  a  drainage  system,  a
water treatment system, a flood prevention system,  telephones  and  garbage
collection.

The  communal   facility   included   two   child   daycare   centres,   two
kindergartens, one primary school, one secondary school, eight  playgrounds,
one public park with  a  sports  centre,  one  police  kiosk,  eight  public
telephones, one bus terminal and one community hall. All this  was  done  in
such a way as to establish a self-sufficient and proud community.

Some of the houses are one-storey  and  two-storey  row  houses,  two-storey
semidetached houses, three-storey semidetached houses,  and  two-storey  and
three-storey shop houses. Now, that's interesting. If people want to have  a
shebeen or sell food they can apply for  these  shop  houses  so  that  they
conduct the business in the shop  below  while  the  house  is  on  top.  In
shebeens, food  houses  and  so  on  in  our  townships  where  business  is
conducted, I  sometimes  wonder  what  happens  to  the  children  in  those
households. Where do they find the place and time to study  in  a  congenial
atmosphere?

Here we have a kind of solution so that whatever the parents  undertake  ...

Dkt B M RADEBE (KwaZulu-Natali): Ngiyabonga  Sihlalo  ukuthola  leli  thuba.
Ngicabanga ukuthi okuningi ebengithi ngizokusho uNgqongqoshe  umama  uSigcau
usekuthintile. Okubaluleke kakhulu ukubonga  ukuzibophezela  kwalo  hulumeni
wentando yeningi ekutheni  elekelele  ekuguquleni  izimpilo  zabantu.  Umama
uSigcau ukhulume ngalezi zinhla uHulumeni aqhamuke nazo.  Kuyiqiniso  ukuthi
abantu  bakithi  bebehamba   amakhilomitha   anga-300   kuya   kwangama-400.
Bekufanele   bagibele    bayolanda    amapasi,    bayobhalisa    izimpesheni
emadolobheni. Kodwa ngenxa yalolu hlelo lwezinhla uHulumeni  aqhamuke  nalo,
njengokuthi kube khona indawo yezenhlalakahle, kube  khona  indawo  yamapasi
... (Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Dr  B  M  RADEBE:  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Thank  you,  Chairperson,   for   this
opportunity. I think a lot of what I was  going  to  say  has  already  been
mentioned by the hon Minister. What is important is that we  appreciate  the
democratic Government's commitment to  improving  people's  lives.  Minister
Sigcau talked about these clusters that the Government has proposed.  It  is
true that our people used to travel about 300 to 400  kilometres.  Sometimes
they had to take buses to get to where they had to collect their IDs and  to
get to town to register for pensions. But because of these  structures  that
the Government has come up with, a welfare office, an  office  where  people
can collect their Ids ...]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  I  have  just
been informed that the interpreter is on his way to interpret. This,  again,
is disorganising us. If only our  interpreters  could  be  on  stand-by  and
immediately interpret when the member speaks  an  African  language.  Please
continue, hon member.

Dkt B M RADEBE (KwaZulu-Natali): Lezi zinto  umama  uSigcau  akhuluma  ngazo
izinto engicabanga ukuthi abantu bakithi, ikakhulukazi  abantu  basemakhaya,
sezibasize kakhulu,  ngoba  bekufanele  bagibele,  ngalezi  zimali  ezincane
zezimpesheni abekade bezithola, ukuze bazothola  izingqalasizinda,  amapasi,
izinto zokuthi zibasize, nazo  zonke  ezinye  izinto.  Ezinye  izinto  umama
azishilo lapha ngicabanga ukuthi  yizinto  ezibalulekile.  Njengephothifolyo
komidi yezeMisebenzi yoMphakathi kanye noHulumeni  basekhaya,  sibe  nohlelo
esilwenzile lokulalelwa kwezikhalo zomphakathi ngokuhlanganyela emva  kokuba
sitholile ukuthi imali efakwa  uHulumeni,  ikakhulukazi  ezindaweni  zabantu
bakithi, ayifiki ngendlela uHulumeni afuna ifike ngayo.

UHulumeni uyayifaka imali eningi, kodwa uma sekufanele  ukuba  isetshenziswe
laphaya kubantu emazingeni aphansi, ayifiki  kubo  noma  kwesinye  isikhathi
ithatha isikhathi eside ngaphambi kokuba abantu bakithi bayithole.

Nginekhophi  lapha  yezokulalelwa  kwezikhalo  zomphakathi,   ngizoyishiyela
uNgqongqoshe ukuze athi ukuyibheka lapho  abantu  bekhuluma  khona.  Ngalolu
hlelo   lokulalela   umphakathi   siqale   eHadingi,   saya   eMgungundlovu,
eNyukhasela, eLadysmith, oLundi, eVryheid  naseKokstad.  Abantu  bebekhuluma
ngezinkinga  abahlangana  nazo  yize  uHulumeni  eseshilo  ukuthi  akwakhiwe
iphrojekthi  ewuhlobo  oluthile.  Okokuqala,  umqulu  wamathenda,   ngumqulu
omkhulu  kakhulu  futhi  ubhalwe  ngolimi  abantu   bakithi   abangaluqondi.
Okwesibili, uma abantu  bakithi  laba  uHulumeni  athi  abanikwe  umsebenzi,
ngithandile  uma  uNgqongqoshe  ethi   akudlulwe   manje   kulokhu   kokuthi
bangabezinkonteleka ezisafufusa. Nabo manje  ake  bebe  osozinkontoleka  nje
ngoba kunokuhlukunyezwa  okukhulu  okwenziwa  yilezi  zinkonteleka  ezinkulu
zikwenza kulezi okuthiwa  zisafufusa,  ziyafufusa,  ziyofufusa  kuyoze  kube
yinini.

Enye yezinkinga ekhona  lapha  ukuthi  abantu  bakithi  uma  sebenikezwa  le
misebenzi, ikakhulukazi ngikhuluma  ngesifundazwe  engivela  kuso  iKwaZulu-
Natali, enye inkinga ekhalisa abantu bakithi ukusebenzisa ipolitiki  ngemali
kahulumeni.  Yinkinga  enkulu  le  KwaZulu-Natali  lapho  abantu   okufanele
bakhiphe amakhadi  obulungu  balelo  qembu  eliphethe  kuleyo  ndawo  kuqala
ngaphambi  kokuthi  banikezwe  amathenda.  Akumina   Sihlalo   osho   njalo,
uNgqongqoshe uzozitholela lokhu kulo mbiko wokulalelwa  kwezikhalo  zabantu.
Nginawo ngisho amakhasethi  ngoba  yaqoshwa  leya  nto  eyayishiwo  ngabantu
laphaya ukuthi abantu bakithi baxhashazwa  ngendlela  yokuthi  le  mihlomulo
nale mali uHulumeni athi ayiye kosiza abantu,  ayifiki  kubona.  Ngenhlanhla
ilungu elihloniphekile uBarbara Thompson noMntwana uZulu babekhona  kwaNyama
esithangamini  sokulalela  izikhalo   zomphakathi.   Abantu   babekhala   mi
izinyembezi bethi imali uhulumeni abanika yona ayifiki kubo.

Kunezinye  izinto  ezenzekayo  laphaya   kubantu   bakithi   uma   uHulumeni
useyikhiphile imali. Ngithi angizisho lezi zinto  ngoba  zingezinye  zezinto
ezibambezela lokhu kunikezelwa uNgqongqoshe akhuluma  ngakho,  lapho  abantu
bakithi kufanele banikezwe amathenda, kodwa bese kuba  nokubambezeleka  kube
sekudluliwe  njalo  nakulabo  abekade  benikezwa  amathenda.  Uthola  ukuthi
umuntu unikeziwe ithenda  endaweni  ethile,  inkosi  ethile,  hhayi  eyodwa,
abantu  bakithi  babenikezwe  ithenda,  ngaphambi  kokuba  umsebenzi  uqale,
inkosi, iyakucela ukuba uyikhokhele ngokuthi nje iyinkosi njengoba  kwenzeka
eSoth Coast.

Umuntu ube esekhokhela inkosi u-R15 000 ngaphambi kokuthi uqale  iphrojekthi
uNgqongqoshe  athe  ayokhokhela  izinhla  zeminyango  lapho  abantu  bakithi
beyolanda  khona  amapasi.  Amakhosi  hhayi  eyodwa,  hhayi  amabili,  hhayi
amathathu, ave ebaxhaphaza abantu bakithi ngalolo  luhlobo.  Ngizama  ukusho
ukuthi  lo  mnyango  wakho  Ngqongqoshe  ubaluleke  kakhulu.  Angazi  ukuthi
yikuphi  ukungenelela  ongakwenza   njengomnyango   ukuze   ulungise   lokhu
kuxhashwazwa kwabantu  bakithi  okwenziwa  laphaya  ezindaweni  zasemakhaya.
Omunye umuntu uMnu. Mthembu wenze umsebenzi ka-R300 000, uthe uma  eseqedile
ukwenza umsebenzi, umxhumanisi wafika kuye  wathi  uzomkhokhela  u-R16  000.
Lokhu  kwenzeka  oLundi,  kukhona  lapha  embikweni  wokulalelwa  kwezikhalo
zomphakathi.

UMthembu wabe eseyibuza ukuthi kungani.  wathi  umxhumanisi,  cha  sengibuye
ngacabanga ukuthi lo msebenzi owenzile awubizi u-R300 000, ubiza u-R16  000.
Kodwa njalo umsebenzi  sewuphelile.  Kwabe  sekwenzekani-ke  emva  kwalokho?
Wakhokhelwa lo R16 000. Wabe  esebuyela  kuye  lo  mxhumanisi,  wathi  ucela
ukuba uMthembu asayine  ifomu  ayeyiphethe.  Wathi  kulungile  ngizoyisayina
ifomu kodwa ngizoke ngiye  kwabafundile  bayoyibheka  ukuthi  ithini.  Ifomu
yayithi ``mina sibanibani Mthembu ngidlulisela imali  yami'',  useqoke  enye
iNkonteleka yomlungu, ithi-ke ifomu ngidlulisela ingxenye  esele  yalo  R300
000 kule  nkampani  entsha,  ngomsebenzi  ongasekho  osewuphelile,  owenziwe
uMthembu manje sekufanele kuhole ngawo umuntu ongazange aze awenze.

Engikushoyo  ukuthi  uNgqongqoshe  unomsebenzi  omkhulu  okufanele   awenze.
Angazi  kade  ngicabanga  sikhuluma  laphaya  izolo  kwi-Phothifolyo  komidi
sixoxa sithi mhlawumbe kuzofanele  sicele  lapha  kwandlunkulu  ukuthi  kube
nomthetho, ozovumela umnyango  kazwelonke  ukuba  ungenelele  futhi  baqaphe
imali abayifakile ngoba  le  mali  ifakwa  uHulumeni  ukuthi  ayisize  bonke
abantu noma ngabe bangabaliphi iqembu lezombusazwe.

Kodwa kwesakithi  isifundazwe  akunjalo,  akunjalo,  cha  akunjalo,  yiyo-ke
inkinga leyo,  njengoba  ngisho-ke  ngithi  nginawo  lo  mbiko  uNgqongqoshe
angawubheka. Uma efuna  amakhasethi  nawo  uzowathola  ngoba  saqopha  konke
ukuze ayinqande le  nto  ngoba  uma  kungenjalo  ekugcineni  abantu  bayothi
uHulumeni akenzi lutho. Kodwa empeleni  uHulumeni  ufaka  izigidi  zamarandi
ukuze abantu basemakhaya  bathole  izinkulisa,  bakhelwe  izikole,  imigwaqo
akube  khona  izindawo  lapho  bezoshaya  khona  amapasi  nezinto  ezitholwe
emnyangweni wezenhlalakahle.

Okokugcina, noma ngabe ibhizinisi lakho liphumelela kangakanani,  kodwa  uma
ungekho enhlanganweni yalowo ophethe kuleyo ndawo,  bakutshela  kwezikabhoqo
nje ukuthi ``ngeke sikunike umsebenzi ngoba awusilo ilungu leqembu  lethu'',
konke kubhalwe lapha kulo mbiko.

Ngicabanga nanokuthi ngithathe lo mbiko  ngiwudlulisele  ophikweni  loFezela
ukuze bakuphenye lokhu ngoba ngempela phela inkohlakalo  le,  ukuthi  umuntu
anikezwe ithenda bese ifika inkosi ithi umuntu akakhokhe u-R15  kuya  ku-R20
000, inkohlakalo leyo. Kuthiwa imali yokuthi uyazethula  enkosini,  kufanele
azethule ngo-R15 000. Ekugcineni le nto ibambezela  le  ntuthuko  esikhuluma
ngayo, ngoba lo  muntu  ngenkathi  ehlela  izimali  efaka  isicelo  sokwenza
umsebenzi,  akazange  awubale  lo  R15  000   wokugwazela   inkosi.   Ugcina
engasabakhokheli abantu abaqashile ngoba le mali  abekade  eyibekele  ukuthi
uzokwenza ngayo lo msebenzi,  u-R15  000,  sewuthathwe  inkosi,  sewuthathwe
yinduna,  sewuthathwe  usibanibani.  Ekugcineni-ke  abantu  bakithi  bagcine
bengaholanga.

Ngakho-ke ngizama ukusho ukuthi ngijabule kabi ukuzwa uNgqongqoshe  ekhuluma
ngale ndlela akhulume ngayo. Ngiyazi ukuthi yini  okufanele  yenziwe,  kodwa
ngifuna ukuphakamisa ukuthi mhlawumbe  kungakuhle  uma  uNgqongqoshe  engake
aqhamuke nomthetho  othile  ozovikela  labosonkontileka  abasafufusa,  ukuze
bangagcini  bengosonkontileka  abasafufusa  nje.  Futhi  nokuthi  balandelwe
ukuze kubhekwe ukuthi bangasizwa kanjani, yini engenziwa ukusiza laba  bantu
asebexhashaziwe bakhokhiswa o-R15 000 abanye banikwa o-R16 000  esikhundleni
sika-R300 000, yini engenziwa. Kodwa nakanjani kukhona okufanele kwenziwe.

Ngaphambi kokuba ngihlale phansi,  ngifisa  ukuncoma  umnyango.  Siyakubonga
Mama  uSigcau,  besihlala  sihamba  nawe  lina  noma  libalele,  uphusha  la

[Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Dr B M RADEBE (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  the  things  Minister  Sigcau
talked  about  are  the  things  from  which  our  people  have   benefited,
especially the rural people, because in the  past  they  had  to  use  their
small pensions on going to collect such basic documents  as  IDs  and  other
things that would help them in  their  lives.  Some  of  the  things  Mother
Sigcau said are very important as far as  I  am  concerned.  As  the  Select
Committee on Public Works and Local  Government,  we  arranged  some  public
hearings after we learnt that the money the  Government  had  given  to  the
areas where our people live  did  not  reach  our  people  in  the  way  the
Government had wanted it to.

The Government does put a lot of money down,  but  it  does  not  reach  the
people at grassroots level, or sometimes  it  takes  a  long  time  for  our
people to get the money.

I have a copy of the report on the public hearings and I will leave  it  for
the Minister so that she can read it and see where the people were from.  We
started with this public hearing  process  in  Harding.  We  then  moved  to
Pietermaritzburg, Newcastle, Ladysmith, Ulundi, Vryheid and Kokstad.  People
were talking about the problems  they  were  experiencing  even  though  the
Government had said that certain projects should be built.

Firstly, there is a large number of  tenders  and  they  are  written  in  a
language that our people do not understand. Secondly, about our people,  the
ones that the Government said should be given jobs, I am happy to  hear  the
Minister  say  that  these  people  should  no  longer   be   called   small
contractors. They, too, must be independent contractors, because there is  a
great deal of abuse by independent contractors  of  the  small  contractors.
They are always referred to as emerging contractors. For how long will  they
be called emerging contractors?

Another problem our people  experience  when  they  are  given  these  jobs,
especially  in  KwaZulu-Natal  where  I  come  from,  is  the  use  of   the
Government's money for political purposes. This is a big problem in KwaZulu-
Natal, where people have to produce membership cards of the political  party
that is in charge of that particular area before they are given tenders.  It
is not I who says so, because the Minister will find this in the  report  on
the public hearings. I even have cassettes, because we  recorded  everything
that was said. Our people are exploited to such an extent that the  benefits
of the money that the Government sends do not reach them.

Fortunately, hon members like Barbara Thompson and Prince Zulu were  present
at the public hearing which  was  held  at  Mnyama.  People  were  literally
crying, saying that the money that the Government was giving  them  did  not
reach them.

Other things are happening to our people after the Government  releases  the
money. I feel I must mention these things, because they are the things  that
delay the delivery process the Minister is talking  about,  the  process  in
which  our  people  should  be  given  tenders.  However,  some  delays  are
experienced even by those to whom tenders have already been given.

One finds that a person is given a tender in a  particular  area.  Then,  an
inkosi asks that person who has been given the tender to pay him  before  he
can even start the work. This has been happening on the South Coast.

The person has to pay the inkosi about R15 000 before he starts the  project
with the money that the hon Minster said  would  be  used  to  pay  for  the
clusters at which people could collect their IDs.  Amakhosi,  not  one,  not
two, but many of them, are exploiting our people in that manner.

What I am trying to say is that  your  department,  hon  Minister,  is  very
important. I do not know what sort of intervention  you  can  make  to  stop
this exploitation of our people, especially in the rural areas. One man,  Mr
Mthembu, did a job worth R300 000. After finishing this  job,  a  consultant
came to him and said that he would pay him only R16 000.  This  happened  in
Ulundi, and it is also included in the  report  that  I  have  here  on  the
public hearings. When Mr Mthembu asked the consultant  why,  the  consultant
said: ``I have given this more thought and I have realised that the job  you
did was not worth R300 000. It is worth only R16 000.''

What happened after that was that Mr  Mthembu  was  paid  the  R16 000.  The
consultant then asked him to sign a form, which he  had  in  his  hands.  Mr
Mthembu said: ``Okay, I will sign the form, but I will  first  consult  with
educated people to check with them what the  form  says.''  The  form  said:
``I,  so  and  so  Mthembu,  hereby  transfer  my  money  to  another  white
contractor.'' The form  said  he  was  transferring  the  remainder  of  the
R300 000 for the completed work done to this new  company.  Now  the  person
who is going to get the benefit of that is the one who did not do the job.

What I am saying is that the hon Minister has a big job to do. We  discussed
this in the select committee and agreed  that  perhaps  we  should  ask  the
national Government to  pass  legislation  that  will  enable  the  national
Department of Public Works to intervene and monitor the money they  give  to
provincial  governments,  because  this  money  is  given  by  the  national
Government to help everyone, regardless of their political affiliation.  But
in our province this is not so. It is not so, and this is a problem.

As I have said, I have the report that the hon Minister can look at. If  she
wants the cassettes, she can also get them because we  recorded  everything.
She can stop all these things, because if that is not done, people will  say
at the end of the day that the Government is not doing  a  thing,  when,  in
fact, the Government puts down millions of rands so that  rural  people  can
get créches, schools, roads and places where they can register for their  ID
documents  and  receive  other  things  from  the   Department   of   Social
Development.

Lastly, no matter how successful one's business is, if one does  not  belong
to the party that the person in charge of that area belongs to, one is  told
face to face that: ``We will not give you the job because you do not  belong
to our party''. All these things are included in the report.

I am even thinking of taking this report to the Scorpions so that  they  can
investigate, because it really is corruption if a person is given  a  tender
and then the inkosi tells that person to pay him R15 000  or  R20 000.  That
is corruption. They say that that money is the money through  which  someone
is introducing himself to the inkosi. They say he should  introduce  himself
by paying R15 000.

In the end, this will delay the development we are  talking  about,  because
when a person does his calculations, he does not  budget  for  this  R15 000
with which he is supposed to bribe the inkosi. He ends up  being  unable  to
pay his workers because the money he reserved for this work,  which  is  R15
000, has been taken by the inkosi. It is taken by a headman, or it is  taken
by so and so. As a result, our people do not get their salaries.

Therefore, what I am trying to say is that I was very  happy  to  hear  what
the hon the Minister said. I know  what  should  be  done,  but  I  want  to
suggest that perhaps it would be better if the hon Minister  could  come  up
with legislation that will protect emerging contractors so that  they  don't
end up staying emerging contractors.

We should also look at how they can be assisted,  what  should  be  done  to
help those who have been exploited, who have already paid those  amounts  of
R15 000 and those who were given R16 000 instead of R300 000.  What  can  be
done to help them? No matter what, something should be done to help them.
Before I sit down, I would like to say congratulations  to  the  department.
We congratulate you, Mother Sigcau, on the fact that you  were  always  with
us, whether it was sunny or rainy. You were pushing these projects that  our
President was talking about. But it worries us to see that  the  moment  you
turn your back, they change all the things you wanted to have happen for  us
and start doing their own thing. It is painful to us who live there.

Therefore, my request to the department is that something - I  do  not  know
what - should be done to rectify this exploitative situation  and  abuse  of
our people in those areas. Mayors are fooling  people.  Sometimes  they  ask
for donations in China. When they come back, they  announce  that  they  are
going to deliver this and that in a particular area.  Then  one  finds  that
what they had delivered was  bought  with  the  money  that  was  donated  -
perhaps a sewing machine which was donated overseas. They then make  out  an
invoice that shows that that machine was bought by the  council,  while  the
machine was not bought by them, but was a donation. These are  some  of  the
problems facing our province.

Therefore, we would be happy if the Minister and her department  could  come
up with a solution. We will contact the Portfolio Committee on Public  Works
soon, because we should report on what we have found.  We  should  also  say
what  we  think  the  solution  would  be,  because  ...   [Time   expired.]

Cllr H JENKINS (Salga): Chairperson, infrastructure is a  critical  part  of
developmental local government agenda. Developmental  local  government  is,
as such, local government committed to  working  with  citizens  and  groups
within the  community  to  find  sustainable  ways  to  meet  their  social,
economic and material needs, and to improve their quality of life.

Local  government  plays  a  central  role  in   representing   communities,
protecting human rights and meeting basic needs. It must focus  its  efforts
and resources on improving the quality of life  of  communities,  especially
those  members  and  groups  within  communities   that   are   most   often
marginalised or excluded, such as women, the vulnerable - and  here  we  are
talking about children, the elderly and the disabled - and the very poor.

It is therefore critical that local  government,  in  fulfilling  its  role,
address and support human development - the process  of  enlarging  people's
choices and raising their level of  wellbeing  -  within  its  processes  of
development and, in particular, infrastructure outlay among other things.

This then places poor  people  at  the  centre  of  development  strategies.
Approaches should ensure that poor people have the  necessary  capacity  and
access to participate in growth.

An enormous proportion of local government budgets  are  spent  annually  on
addressing, mostly, the dire needs of rural and urban communities. Here,  we
are talking about poor communities who lack access to basic services.  Thus,
the thrust of infrastructure development and outlay is to ensure that  while
supporting  the  growing  needs  and  sophistication  of  our  economy,  the
majority of citizens have access to basic services.

Huge infrastructure backlogs are evident in our towns, villages and  cities.
The backlogs relate largely to roads,  water,  electricity,  sanitation  and
housing, therefore pointing to the compelling need to sustain  and  continue
investment in, and hence delivery of, infrastructure across the country.

Of significance in the  delivery  of  infrastructure  is  the  potential  to
address the  socioeconomic  challenges  facing  our  communities.  The  most
pressing challenges include the high incidence of unemployment, poverty  and
illiteracy.

While greater  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  community  participation  in
decision-making  processes,  it  is  now  necessary  to  widen  and   deepen
community  participation   in   implementation   processes.   Infrastructure
development  must   be   consistently   geared   towards   increased   local
participation, as has been  noted  in  several  projects  and  Public  Works
programmes.

Community participation in the  implementation  process  points  to  several
anchors of  sustainability,  namely  an  increased  community  skills  base;
community  maintenance;  local  ownership;  higher  tendencies  to  pay  for
services; stimulation of the local economy; job  creation;  improved  income
and  livelihood;  the  mobilisation  and  enhancement  of  social   capital;
sustained community development; and diminished dependency on handouts.

Several vehicles  for  delivery  and  implementation  of  infrastructure  in
support of community development are notable, namely local  procurement  and
targeted procurement, and emerging contractor development  and  support.  In
addition, the community-based  Public  Works  initiatives  of  the  national
Department of Public Works are a  case  in  point  and  relate  to  improved
access to trade  opportunities;  directly  productive  initiatives;  labour-
saving schemes; social cohesion projects; and environmental protection.

Infrastructure  delivery,  in  response  to  and  linked   with   integrated
development plans, has the potential to strengthen sustainable  development.
It is thus pivotal to  ensure  that  community  development  priorities  and
preferences are the basis of the design,  implementation  and  commissioning
of infrastructure. Unless infrastructure  is  informed  and/or  responds  to
community priorities, as reflected in IDPs, sustainability is likely  to  be
compromised.

Finally, sustainable  development  cannot  be  achieved  without  deliberate
efforts  to   improve   community   development   and   livelihoods.   Thus,
infrastructure  development  must,  in  all  instances,  be  geared  towards
supporting  and  advancing  community  development.  Socioeconomic  benefits
deriving from and supported by integrated infrastructure  development  point
to success in sustainable development. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Minister, what a welcome announcement you made and  how  very
interestingly and well your speech was laid out.  The  announced  initiative
of the President, which is coming coincidentally with this  debate,  to  use
infrastructure development as a tool to improve the quality  of  life  is  a
very welcome one indeed. It will be widely acclaimed and makes  this  debate
more relevant.  The  initiative  can  increase  efficiency,  improve  public
health and promote rural development - indeed a virtuous circle.

The vital thing is that the  greater  the  capital  expenditure  on  capital
products, the better the investment and the more the benefits cascade in  an
intergenerational and intercommunity way. I believe, however,  that  capital
expenditure is too small a proportion of the total amount envisaged  by  the
Government's development programme.

Thus I trust the Goverment - and I was delighted to hear what  the  Minister
had to say - will use this deserving initiative in  the  first  instance  to
get rid of maintenance backlogs,  using  labour-intensive  programmes  where
possible. I trust  that  as  well  as  addressing  new  infrastructure,  the
initiative  will  be  mobilised  to  repair   and   upgrade   old   existing
infrastructure.

The Minister will know by way of example that some of  our  roads  are  more
than 50 years old and  need  serious  repair.  Early  intervention  in  road
surfacing can cut road maintenance costs by half. The  longer  you  wait  to
intervene in the process, the more the costs rise  exponentially.  One  also
needs to be careful not to go into competition with the private sector,  but
rather to harness it as a primary instrument of development.  If  we  don't,
we may well see capacity problems developing and an inability to  spend  the
sums available, or to spend wisely.

Wage rates also need to be kept at realistic levels on projects  undertaken,
otherwise people already employed quit their jobs and  enrol  in  the  state
programme. One is then recycling jobs, not creating them. This  happened  in
the past with the programme to clear alien vegetation in  the  Western  Cape
in which farmworkers resigned their jobs to enlist in the programme  because
the pay was  better,  but  then  couldn't  get  their  jobs  back  when  the
programme was over.

The programme outlined by the Government is a  wiser  application  of  state
funds than a subsistence grant not linked to development. In  the  end,  the
health of the  nation  is  linked  to  our  ability  to  create  wealth.  To
distribute wealth is relatively easy, but to create it is  not  so  easy.  A
good infrastructure is a major contribution to the economic  health  of  our
country. The purpose of this programme is not only  jobs,  but  self-respect
and self-reliance, and those permanent skills that are learnt and stay  with
people forever.

We need to foster a culture of work  in  South  Africa,  not  a  culture  of
dependence. The savings and  benefits  for  the  state  over  time  will  be
legion. In this whole field one has  add-ons  to  existing  projects,  small
local projects and large  locomotive  schemes  that  have  large  downstream
cascading benefits. Past governments built Sasol, the national road  system,
the Eskom grid, the electrification of railways, large dams and so on.  That
is part of our history, and we know  that  this  Government  also  has  some
large-scale locomotive projects in the pipeline.

By doing upgrading, long-term maintenance,  infrastructure  enhancement  and
add-ons,  you  get  more  bang  for  you   buck   and   dramatic   lifestyle
improvements. A good example of this has  been  piping  domestic  water  and
domestic electricity from existing grids - from long-standing existing  dams
to existing housing. These new, comparatively low-cost linkages to  existing
infrastructure have resulted in an exponential  improvement  in  quality  of
life in our country, for  instance  in  health.  They  have  also  made  the
educational improvements possible.

The same swift benefits can be achieved in  other  fields  -  in  roads,  in
agriculture and in agro-industrial business, which is a massive  locomotive.
The benefits of this kind of programme are, at  best,  labour-intensive  and
put no pressure on the balance of payments of the current  account,  because
most of the raw materials used in this kind of  project  are  usually  home-
grown. Furthermore, this promotes regionalism because projects,  labour  and
raw materials can be sourced in the same areas.

This kind of programme also makes development possible in  areas  which  are
very undeveloped. In fact, the project should be constructed in this way  to
bring about maximum local benefit. The last thing is  that  the  multipliers
from this kind of project are enormous as the  money  cascades  through  the
communities concerned.

Finally, the impact on confidence is large - and I am so glad  the  Minister
mentioned this in her excellent speech - the confidence  of  local  citizens
and the confidence of outside investors who  recognise  the  stability  that
these programmes bring if conducted wisely and cost-effectively.

An example I can think of - and I think the Minister can think of  others  -
is the huge Makhatini Flats in Kwazulu-Natal, the  almost  unused  water  in
the Pongola River Dam. By putting in the infrastructure, we can put tens  of
thousands of families on their own land who can plant  crops  that  we  need
like sugar, soya beans,  high-value  imported  spices  and  vegetables  like
tomatoes. This is, in other words,  sustainable  development  that  makes  a
contribution to job creation. I thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Madam Chairperson, hon Minister,  permanent  and  special
delegates here present, I would like to start by  welcomimg  the  speech  of
the hon Minister, particularly her invitation to members to make inputs  and
advise  the  department  regarding  nonimperative,  grossly  or  incorrectly
located projects put up in our communities. I think that goes a long way  in
accommodating Dr Nel, who waited for six  years  before  Die  Beeld  brought
attention to a school that was not well put.

It  is  very  unfortunate  that  we  have  members  who  do  not  do   their
constituency work, who just sit and wait for the press to alert  them  about
something. This may lead to the possibility in which if one goes  to  heaven
one may give a report that things  are  well  located,  while  there  was  a
school that was misplaced.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I rise on a point of order.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  What  is  out  of  order,  hon  member?  Mr
Windvoël, you may sit down.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I want to enquire  whether  it's  in  order
for a member to say that another member does not do his or her  constituency
work, without the member being here to  defend  himself  or  herself  or  to
respond to that.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That was not a point of order. Carry  on,  Mr
Windvoël.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Thank you very much, Madam Chairperson. I think we are  a
Government which has introduced various strategies, one of  them  being  the
Integrated Rural  Development  Programme  which  ensures,  as  we  plan  for
development, that we do so in a very integrated way. That's why nowadays  we
speak of the IDPs. We no longer speak of the separate  development  policies
of the past in which development took place in a very disjointed way.

I think it is in that spirit that we also encourage members to be  proactive
and take heed of the invitation of the Minister to advise  and  make  inputs
to the department in order to prevent such instances from taking place.

I won't waste my time responding to what Mr Raju said, because 67,3% of  his
speech was on poems and some quotation on yawning or moaning minnies,  which
ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, continue with your speech.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Yes, I am proceeding with my speech,  Madam  Chairperson.
It was very painful to hear what our  special  delegate  from  KwaZulu-Natal
was saying - that there are people  involved  in  blatant  corruption  which
stifles development of the emerging  entrepreneurs.  I  am  also  making  my
speech in the context of what the hon Minister said in her  opening  speech,
in that we need to see those people go beyond the point  of  being  emerging
entrepreneurs. Having to pay whatever stipend, or R15 000 or so,  will  make
them perpetual emerging entrepreneurs.

Poverty  eradication  and  easy  access  to   economic   opportunities   are
indispensable for democratisation. Since 1994  our  ANC-led  Government  has
initiated  various  programmes  that  are  at  the  centre  of  our  poverty
eradication programme. Accordingly,  the  Department  of  Public  Works  has
become one  of  the  torchbearers  in  our  Reconstruction  and  Development
Programme. Given its unique position as a catalyst of job creation,  it  has
made huge strides in responding to the  challenges  of  poverty  brought  to
bear on especially rural communities through a lack of infrastructure,  such
as clinics, police stations, schools, water, dams and other projects.

Consequently,  the  department  has  adopted  new   policy   frameworks   to
accelerate  infrastructure  development.  Firstly,  the  potential  of   the
construction industry has been unleashed in order to enable  it  to  play  a
more meaningful role in social development and  economic  growth.  This  has
been achieved through legislation  and  the  strengthening  of  partnerships
between Government and  the  private  sector.  Secondly,  a  Community-Based
Public  Works  Programme  has  been  established   with   a   bias   towards
infrastructure creation.

This programme has delivered tangible  benefits  and  job  opportunities  in
South Africa's poorest provinces - the Eastern Cape, the  Limpopo  province,
KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and so on. Moreover, the  social  impact  of  this
programme has positioned it as an integral  part  of  the  Integrated  Rural
Development Programme which is the largest  beneficiary  of  poverty  relief
funds. Significantly, it has also involved provincial and local  governments
in  the  implementation  of  the  programme.  Of  course  there  are   other
challenges which are faced in terms of how co-ordination is done.
We must also appreciate the supportive role of traditional leaders  in  many
areas. We do also know that there are other areas in which the  relationship
is not so rosy as others which we commend. Dr Radebe has already  gone  into
detail in terms of isolating some of those cases, but we must put on  record
that not all traditional leaders are an obstacle to development.

The latter often make land available for  infrastructure  development.  This
ensures participation, co-operation and ownership by all stakeholders.  This
co-operation has ensured that the Ilima or  Letsema  campaign  is  community
based.

One of the success stories we may highlight is that of  directly  productive
assets, such as bakeries, vegetable  gardens,  market  stalls,  taxi  ranks,
etc, which have been put in place, and which serve as  vehicles  in  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty. Access to trade opportunities, such as  rural
access roads, has been built,  and  social  cohesion  instruments,  such  as
schools and multipurpose community centres, have been put in place.  Labour-
saving projects, such as  water  and  irrigation  systems,  have  also  been
established. We have other projects dealing  with  environmental  protection
such as donga rehabilitation and storm water drains which have also  been  a
success story.

In  line  with  its  mandate  of  accelerating  the   realisation   of   the
socioeconomic objectives of Government, the CBPWP manages a host of  special
projects. One such project are the  community  production  centres  -  CPCs.
These are communal  commercial  centres  for  marketing  and  private-sector
partnering, often utilising  and  adding  value  to  the  local  factors  of
production such as land.

With the CPC  projects,  local  communities  are  equipped  to  address  the
important issue of natural and household food security.  At  present,  seven
CPCs are operational in the Eastern  Cape,  KwaZulu-Natal  and  the  Limpopo
province. However, as stated by the President, Comrade Thabo  Mbeki,  during
the  state  of  the  nation  address  on  14  February  this  year,  further
improvement in the quality of life of our people requires that we  take  new
measures to increase the volume and quality of our investment in the  social
infrastructure and that we improve our performance relative to the  previous
year.

In this regard, we  welcome  the  announcement  by  the  President  of  this
country,  South  Africa,  with  regard  to  the  allocation  of   additional
resources to meet this obligation, and the  launch  of  an  Expanded  Public
Works Programme which the hon Minister has already  alluded  to.  Similarly,
we welcome the expansion  of  the  network  of  the  multipurpose  community
centres, because during our  provincial  visits  communities  were  actually
demanding that  the  MPCCs  should  serve  as  one-stop  centres  where  the
marginalised sections of our communities are actually interfacing  with  the
Government. The announcement by the President on  electronic  communication,
or the linking-up with Government, will also go  a  long  way  in  terms  of
meeting that demand.

A lack of co-ordination and proper planning remains one of the  debilitating
factors regarding the  programmes  which  this  department  is  undertaking.
Added to this is the lack of skills, rigid  bureaucracy  and  discontent  in
some of our communities. It becomes incumbent upon us as the NCOP, as we  do
our oversight function, to check to what  extent  these  factors  are  being
addressed and managed.

Although we have some excellent examples of community, local government  and
provincial co-operation, there are  still  too  many  unnecessary  impending
factors. We are of the view  that  these  factors  the  department,  working
together with our communities and ourselves as members of this House,  would
be in a position to overcome.  At  the  same  time,  we  should  also  guard
against demands for new infrastructure when we are not  optimally  utilising
the existing infrastructure.

I wish to conclude by applauding the department for  amending  the  targeted
affirmative procurement specifications to create  a  preference  for  women-
owned business enterprises. As  indicated  in  the  hon  Minister's  speech,
currently over R100 million worth of construction  projects  are  undertaken
by women-owned enterprises.

We  wish  this  department  all  the  best  in  ensuring  that  through  its
programmes we push back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chair, I must  first  of  all  thank  all  the
members for the contributions they have made this afternoon. I must  confess
that, initially, when you said that I must debate this topic, I did  grumble
a little bit. I said: ``Why does the NCOP want me to exhaust  what  I'll  be
saying in the budget speech?'' Even  as  I  was  coming  here  today  I  was
grumbling. [Laughter.]

I have definitely changed my mind. I now realise that without  this  debate,
some of the aspects we needed to set right on the  expanded  programme,  and
some of the previous programmes, would not have  happened  as  you  had  all
expected.

Regarding certain areas of development, my worry  is  that  if  you  as  the
national department, say at times that certain things are not happening  the
way they should, you sometimes meet with a sense of denial  which  does  not
pay dividends at the end of the day.

The infrastructure that we create - with regard to  the  question  that  was
raised here - actually  belongs  to  the  communities.  Even  when  we  have
handing-over ceremonies, we always make sure that the  MEC  responsible  for
community-related work at local government level is present.  With  some  of
the big projects, we discuss with whoever is responsible whether there  will
be money to maintain those projects.

For instance, with regard to some of the chambers that  we  have  built  for
kings with halls attached, we actually said that each local  government  had
to make sure not only that it provided staff, but that the halls  themselves
were well maintained.

We  are  also  on  record  as  saying  that  if  a  project,   or   whatever
infrastructure has been built, doesn't serve the purpose of that  community,
it can be converted into something else.  I  think  those  in  KwaZulu-Natal
must, together with us, think about what to do with  the  infrastructure  at
Ezingolweni. It is beautiful, but it is minimally  utilised.  I  think  that
once we put our heads together we can find a better  use  for  it  by  other
members of the community than what the infrastructure  was  initially  meant
for.

I am happy that some members are beginning to approve  of  what  we  call  a
``holistic system of  planning''.  The  President  said  that  even  in  the
working of Government we should work as clusters. This followed  shortly  on
an example he had given in Parliament in which he said: Why would you  build
a school if there was going to  be  no  road  leading  to  that  school;  no
communication; and no electricity? This is almost saying that Public  Works,
Minerals and Energy and so on and so forth come together and make sure  that
things happen. So thinking in cluster forms is also very helpful.

Another area in which working in clusters is beginning to pay  dividends  is
with some of the poverty relief programmes that we have  with  Public  Works
and welfare. An example is of people  and  community  gardens.  You  have  a
situation in which some of the community gardens are within a  kilometre  of
each other. One has been set up by Public Works and the  other  by  welfare.
After two years, we don't see a  single  person  utilising  these  community
gardens.

Hence, our approach of saying that if it is necessary to do so,  let's  have
community gardens. However, in the broader sense  of  creating  economy  for
the people in the rural areas, they must learn to put  their  land  together
so that we deal with huge pieces of land which can produce  stuff  that  can
be well marketed. That is one of the things that really must happen.

We are taking a  very  strong  line  on  some  of  the  issues  to  do  with
construction, to do with the tenders that are awarded and  to  do  with  the
shoddy work that is done. I have actually said that if there are  people  in
construction who, despite a warning, continue producing shoddy  work,  those
people must simply be blacklisted because they are not interested in  giving
value for the money that they get paid.

Regarding some of the issues that were raised by the special  delegate  from
KwaZulu-Natal, we will have to take them up and see how  we  can  deal  with
them. As far as Makhatini Flats is concerned, we did start  a  programme  of
putting the infrastructure in place, but the  provincial  MEC  said  he  had
bigger plans  for  the  area.  So  all  we  could  do  was  to  put  up  the
infrastructure for him, and then allow  him  to  continue  with  the  bigger
plans. But I will talk to  him  about  some  of  the  sentiments  that  were
expressed.

With regard to  the  issue  of  bakeries,  I'm  not  sure  whether  this  is
happening in all the provinces but I know that in the Eastern Cape the  NGOs
are no longer going to be actively involved in providing food  for  some  of
the schools. We are going back  to  the  old  system  in  which  communities
themselves, that is the women and whoever  within  the  community,  provided
the food.
I was also happy to hear an announcement by one of the people,  a  lady,  in
an organisation of people in business in KwaZulu-Natal - I don't  know  what
you call it - in which she told us that one of the things they  want  to  do
is to make sure that they provide people with equipment for  bakeries.  This
is something we are actually working on  as  Public  Works  in  that  it  is
useless saying that these women are  going  to  provide  the  food  for  the
schools. They might as  well  form  small  businesses  themselves  by  being
involved in an expanded scheme of bakeries. I think those  are  things  that
will need funding, almost as a matter of urgency.

I must thank all the hon members. I think that this was a  very  comfortable
debate simply because we are beginning to understand what  Public  Works  is
all about. But you still confuse  at  times  what  we  do  nationally,  what
Transport does, and what the provinces do. I will continue to  preach  ``the
gospel according to Stella'', so that  eventually,  without  saying  we  are
drawing lines, you understand which area corrects certain  things.  I  thank
you, Chair. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 16:02.
