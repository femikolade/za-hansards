                 BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The MINISTER OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Thank  you,  Madam  Chairperson  and
colleagues. The tabling of this Bill in Parliament on 2 September  2003  was
another milestone and an important step in the economic revolution that  the
new democratic South Africa has been engaged in since 1994.

Structural reform of an economy is not easy and takes time.  The  legacy  of
apartheid  leaves  us  with  particularly  difficult  challenges   and   the
development of new enterprises and increasing the depth of participation  by
black  persons  in  the  economy.   By   restricting   skills   development,
expropriating  land,  wealth  and  assets  and   by   restricting   business
opportunities for the majority, colonialism and apartheid  laid  barren  the
fields of wealth creation and opportunity for  that  majority.  Structurally
such an economy could  never  prosper.  To  grow  and  develop  our  country
requires an economy that can meet the needs of all our citizens, our  people
and their enterprises in a sustainable manner. This will  only  be  possible
if our economy builds on the full potential of all persons  and  communities
across the length and breadth of this country.

Starting with  the  RDP,  we  have  systematically  addressed  this  legacy.
However, it became evident that we had to more  systematically  address  the
participation of black people in the mainstream  of  economic  activity  and
within the corporations and enterprises,  including  co-operative  forms  of
enterprise in the economy. This realisation led  to  the  formation  of  the
Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council and their path-breaking  report.
The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment  Bill  is  the  outcome  of  this
process.

The policy approach for empowerment is  complex  and  has  to  balance  many
economic processes and forces, not  all  of  which  make  empowerment  easy.
After careful consideration, the framework of the BEE  policy  was  released
by the DTI on behalf of the Government on 19 March 2003. Parliament's  Trade
and Industry portfolio committee adopted the broad-based Bill on 20  August.
After public hearings we've been able to make  a  number  of  important  and
constructive amendments.

The Bill is in essence enabling legislation that  creates  a  framework  for
the development and implementation of black economic  empowerment.  It  does
this by important mechanisms of the Advisory Council Strategy  Document  and
codes of good practice in the publication  of  transformation  charters.  We
believe that it is an innovative response  to  what  will  be  an  important
learning and developmental process that cannot be dealt with  in  the  tight
confines of detailed legislation  and  regulation.  However,  where  there's
also a need for more certainty and clarity of purpose,  the  BEE  Bill  will
give black business a strong participation and voice in  the  South  African
economy. In the hearings there was  concern  that  the  empowerment  process
must not have too narrow a base of beneficiaries. This  is  a  concern  that
the Government shares. However, we have to balance  this  against  the  fact
that the Bill cannot embrace all the programmes and  actions  introduced  by
Government and redress the inequity historically imposed on the majority  of
our people. I believe that the amendments find this balance.

The Bill has been amended to ensure that the law targets a broader  spectrum
of beneficiaries. The concept of empowerment is not one-dimensional  and  is
a process that should result in both higher levels of  black  ownership,  as
well as a reduction in income inequalities. It should  result  in  effective
black participation in the economy, reflected in both the broadening of  the
entrepreneurial   base   and   increased   participation   in    managerial,
professional and other skilled occupations.

The process will therefore include elements of human  resource  development,
employment equity,  enterprise  development,  preferential  procurement,  as
well as  investment,  ownership  and  control  of  enterprises  in  economic
assets.  Social  responsibility   programmes   and   community   development
activities represent many billions of rands  and  the  injection  of  moneys
into our  economy,  most  which  are  in  terms  of  the  BEE  criteria  and
supportive  in  their  nature.  We  believe  that  these  are  complementary
programmes to those I have just mentioned above.

As indicated  earlier,  the  Bill  is  innovative  in  that  it  essentially
provides the enabling environment for the implementation of a strategy.  The
efficacy of the strategy lies in the ability of the Government  to  use  its
own economic position to shape the behaviour of  the  private  sector  in  a
transparent and a co-ordinated manner towards certain objectives.  In  doing
this, it works with the market and not against it. However in doing  so,  it
achieves objectives that  the  market  would  not  achieve  or  achieve  too
slowly.

There is now a realisation that we will not have growth and  development  if
we  cannot  ensure  that  all  our  citizens  are  active   and   meaningful
participants  in  the  economy  and  have   equal   opportunity   for   such
participation.  This  allows  a  common  purpose  around  which  the   state
intervenes  in  a  developmental  manner  to  ensure  that  the  large   and
collective benefits of growth and development will be generated  and  shared
by all. This developmental and growth-orientated approach  is  and  must  be
fundamental to our understanding of the process and  how  we  implement  it.
BEE is not an imposition, but the opening of opportunities that  the  market
itself would have inadequately realised.

The new Act will provide the instruments to monitor and sensibly  adjust  by
consultation  as  the   process   unfolds.   These   instruments   are   the
establishment of the advisory council as  an  advisory  body  to  allow  for
stakeholder participation in the formulation, monitoring and  implementation
of policy; the ability of the Minister to issue codes on  good  practice  on
BEE which must also be taken into  account  by  organs  of  state;  and  the
ability  of  the  Minister  to  issue  guidelines  for  the  development  of
transformation charters by different sectors of the economy.  Such  charters
would need to include specific mechanisms to achieve BEE objectives in  that
sector in a comprehensive and appropriate manner,  and  provide  measurement
indicators and powers.

The Bill also  empowers  the  Minister  to  publish  in  the  Gazette  these
charters for the particular sectors of the economy. This is the  essence  of
the score-card approach. The publication of the strategy  document  provides
a flexible and authoritative vehicle for  articulating  policy  and  guiding
public and private sector participation in BEE. Since the publishing of  the
strategy document in March, we have already  seen  many  developments  which
confirm the wisdom of allowing for a  stable,  but  evolving  approach.  The
different forms of ownership participation have emerged  as  the  score-card
approach unfolds.

So does the question of how this works over time arise,  and  we've  had  to
address the varied corporate strategies of large multinationals  through  to
small family-owned enterprises. All have  to  be  treated  within  the  same
framework with flexibility that accords with their economic positions.

We have a very diverse economy and a very sophisticated  one  at  that.  The
need for the public sector to be more uniform in its  approach  has  emerged
strongly. In  all  this  we  have  to  continuously  balance  the  need  for
certainty with that  of  being  flexible  in  the  face  of  commercial  and
financial good sense.

In the financing of BEE there have been new approaches. As we  indicated  in
the strategy document, financing of BEE must also  deal  with  some  of  the
macro aspects of the capital market. This requires  us  to  co-ordinate  our
efforts and ensure that we have the right products for the purpose. The  IDC
has done good work and has recently announced its empowerment bond  and  its
approach on this and other new products will become available.

In the DTI we've had a fresh look at the National Empowerment  Fund  and  it
too will make certain new products available that complement  those  of  the
IDC and the private sector. We are therefore confident that  we  can  manage
the process that leverages in private sector financing in a manner  that  is
sustainable and promotes growth and stable capital markets.

I want to stress once again that what drives our policy is that  equity  and
participation by all are the real drivers of growth and development.  It  is
growth and development that are the final nails in the coffin  of  apartheid
and the first in building a new and  prosperous  democracy.  Hard  work  and
goodwill are required to build a  strong,  nonracial,  nonsexist,  equitable
and sustainable economy. There are no magic formulae or  quick  fixes;  only
the determination and the vision of our people.

The process from here is to  begin  putting  in  place  the  mechanisms  for
implementing the strategy. I've asked the task  team  that  I  appointed  to
meet again in October to do some work on finalising  the  strategy  document
and thereby addressing many areas  that  have  been  raised  in  the  public
hearings and in the interactions with the private sector and the  task  team
itself.

Financial services and information communication technology sectors are  the
two most prominent sectors currently involved in the process  of  developing
their own specific charters. This process is driven entirely by the  private
sector itself, with Government only providing  support  and  guidance  where
required. Some progress  has  been  made  in  the  design  of  the  ICT  and
financial sector charters. We hope to have the benefit  of  insights  gained
in their work before we publish the final strategy document.

We will prepare  the  initial  codes  of  practice  and  put  in  place  the
institutional support for the advisory council once the Act is  passed  into
law and that council is appointed. The work on the other financial  products
to be provided by the NEF will  continue  and  we  hope  to  announce  these
within the next few months. The NEF will in the meantime continue  with  the
venture capital deals that it has in the pipeline.

We have  presented  the  policy  to  the  wide  range  of  institutions  and
structures, and I'm pleased to say that there is general support  for  this.
At the weekend in our discussions with the international  advisory  council,
again there was support, both for the policy's objectives and also  for  the
pragmatic approach that we are taking with regard to foreign  companies  and
generally the pragmatic approach we're taking with regard to the policy.

I believe that within the private sector we  now  have  a  sense  of  common
purpose that this is a common task that we must  all  embark  upon  for  our
common good. There's  been  a  flood  of  approaches  and  initiatives  that
Government has been asked to comment on. Multinational companies as a  whole
and often by their national origin have considered BEE  and  are  continuing
to make constructive and exciting inputs.

The Oppenheimer family has had the courage of  their  convictions  and  made
concrete proposals  in  public  to  advance  the  process  -  the  so-called
Brenthurst initiative. As one would expect  and  welcome  in  South  Africa,
there has been intense debates on the politics and efficacy of  Government's
approach. However, it is my impression that the market  is  responding  well
to the policy and strategy. So, events are certainly  moving  in  the  right
direction. It is an  exciting  challenge  upon  which  much  in  our  future
depends. Let us go at the matter with determination and good sense that  are
becoming the hallmark of our democracy.

I would like to express in this House as well the  gratitude  of  Government
to the Black Economic Empowerment Council chaired by  Cyril  Ramaphosa,  for
its pioneering work and commitment to this worthy  cause.  Many  members  of
the council have continued to work hard in the task team that I mentioned  a
moment ago, to which the DTI and Government owe a great deal. I  would  like
to thank the portfolio committees under Dr  Davies  and  Mr  Tolo  who  once
again have done their work with professionalism and insight. I really  don't
know what the DTI would have done without  such  fine  committees.  Finally,
thanks from the Deputy Minister and I to the team in the DTI led  by  Lionel
October and  Philisiwe  Buthelezi  for  their  tireless  and  intellectually
thorough commitment to the purpose of this Bill. I  believe  we  are  adding
another crucial dimension to the programmes of economic  transformation  and
restructuring that will ensure our future, and I commend this  Bill  to  the
National Council of Provinces. Thank you, Madam Chairperson. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, I am pleased  to  note  the
presence in the gallery  of  the  President  of  the  Senate  of  the  Czech
Republic, President Pithart and his delegation. If  we  could  ask  them  to
stand for  a  moment.  [Applause.]  Colleagues,  hon  colleagues,  President
Pithart, you are most welcome to the National Council of Provinces  and  the
Parliament of South Africa.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, at the outset let  me  be  quite  clear,  the  DA
shares the aspirations to create the space and opportunity for those  fellow
citizens who have been dispossessed by  the  apartheid  state,  to  have  an
equitable stake in the economy of the democratic South Africa.

Even though we  may  have  drafted  the  objectives  of  the  Bill  slightly
differently, in substance the  DA  supports  those  objectives  set  out  in
clause 2 of the Bill. The DA will support creating opportunities  to  enable
meaningful participation of black people in the economy. The DA agrees  that
there  is  a  need  to  change  the  racial  composition  of  ownership  and
management structures. We agree that communities, workers and  co-operatives
should have a stake in the economy. We agree that  black  women  should  own
and manage enterprises and that they should have greater access to  economic
activities, infrastructure and skills training.

The DA supports promoting investment programmes  that  lead  to  broad-based
and meaningful participation in the economy by  black  people  in  order  to
achieve sustainable development and general prosperity. We agree that  rural
and local communities need to be empowered by enabling  access  to  economic
activities, land, infrastructure, ownership and skills. Where then does  the
problem lie?

The Bill establishes a council which will amongst other  things  advise  the
Government on black economic empowerment,  codes  of  good  practice  and  a
strategy on black economic empowerment. Recent history has  taught  us  that
this council will be packed with ANC yes  men  and  women,  more  intent  on
entrenching the position of a black elite ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Order!
Continue, hon member.

Mr L G LEVER: ... which already has access to capital, rather than  focusing
on the truly disadvantaged.

One only has to look at the  application  of  the  preferential  procurement
legislation to see that the elite always gets the lion's share, while  those
most in need are given the crumbs.

The DA has  nothing  against  a  black  elite  -  in  fact,  it  welcomes  a
successful and prosperous black elite - but in a Bill like  this  the  truly
disadvantaged should be the primary beneficiaries.  Abuse  and  manipulation
of this Bill is made possible by the  way  it  has  been  built  around  the
definitions  of  ``black   people''   and   ``broad-based   black   economic
empowerment''. The DA believes that the Bill should have been  built  around
a means test which would  have  focused  on  the  truly  disadvantaged,  the
overwhelming majority of whom are black. These  are  the  people  this  Bill
should have served. For this reason the DA will not support this Bill.

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, Minister Erwin and colleagues,  the  purpose
of this Bill, as the hon Minister has already  indicated,  is  basically  to
establish a legislative framework to promote black economic empowerment.

Clause 2, which sets out the objectives of the  Bill,  makes  it  abundantly
clear  that  the  Bill  not  only   represents   top   DTI   priority,   but
understandably so also that of Government. We all realise and, as  a  matter
fact cannot deny, that transformation in the economic  field  is  imperative
because colonialism  and  apartheid  left  a  legacy  of  dispossession  and
disempowerment;  transformation   has   political,   social   and   economic
dimensions; and  a  more  equitable  economy  will  support  the  drive  for
accelerated growth.

Since 1994  there  have  been  various  policies  and  programmes  aimed  at
transformation,   namely   urban   renewal,   rural   development,   tourism
transformation,  a  strategic  plan  for  agriculture  and  small   business
development, and an integrated human resource development strategy.

The key principles playing an important role towards the attainment of  this
goal are that black economic empowerment is an inclusive  process;  that  it
is part of  South  Africa's  growth  strategy;  and  that  economic  growth,
development and BEE are complementary.

The strategy  of  a  broad-based  BEE  involves  a  process  which  directly
contributes to the economic transformation of South Africa and brings  about
significant increases in the numbers of black people  who  manage,  own  and
control the country's economy, and brings  about  significant  decreases  in
economic inequalities. The term ``broad-based'' in the  Bill's  title  seeks
to broaden the entrepreneurial base to extend  black  participation  in  the
economy  as  measured  in  terms  of  ownership,   management   and   skills
development; to develop local  communities  and  employees;  and  to  reduce
income inequalities and poverty.

Business Day less than a month ago reported on  a  study  prepared  for  the
Bank of New York that, and I quote:


  Uncertainty about the implementation of black  economic  empowerment  and
  what its effect is likely to be, has negatively  affected  US  investors'
  perceptions of investment in South Africa.

That same newspaper, however, displayed the  other  bright  and  encouraging
side of the coin by reporting yesterday that, and I quote once more:


  World business leaders represented  on  President  Mbeki's  International
  Investment Council have given  their  backing  to  South  Africa's  black
  empowerment strategy, signalling to  fellow  investors  that  empowerment
  does not pose a threat to their businesses in South Africa.

A former chairman of a Swedish-Swiss conglomerate summarised and voiced  the
opinion of world business leaders with his remark that  they  are  convinced
that it is the right and necessary move to  make.  The  New  NP  shares  and
endorses that sentiment.

I, however, wish to express disappointment that the  definition  of  ``black
people'' as it appears in the Bill, namely that it  ``  is  a  generic  term
which  means  Africans,  coloureds  and  Indians'',  does  not  include  the
original caveat that they, for very obvious reasons, should  also  be  South
African citizens or permanent residents of the Republic. The  argument  that
the present definition  conforms  with  the  definition  in  the  Employment
Equity Act is not convincing, as two  other  petroleum-related  Bills  which
are in an advanced stage in their progress through  Parliament  specifically
make mention in  various  sections  that  the  purpose  is  to  promote  the
advancement of, not just any  historically  disadvantaged  individuals,  but
specifically historically disadvantaged South Africans.

The New NP will, however, not allow this small  but  significant  detail  to
change our already  stated  favourable  sentiments.  We  support  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Deputy Chairperson, hon members and  hon  Minister,  debating
this Bill as we do, on the eve of  the  national  Heritage  Day  and  a  few
months towards the dawn a decade of freedom, we in the  ANC  are  more  than
confident to declare that the  past  nine  years  of  democratic  governance
represent a legacy of a nation in action for self-renewal - self-renewal  to
eradicate socioeconomic  and  political  disparities  for  the  creation  of
lasting peace, stability and prosperity.

As we approach a decade of  freedom,  we  look  back  with  pride  that  the
marathon traversed by our people under the leadership of the ANC, since  its
founding conference in Mangaung in 1912, has not yet been in vain.

In passing the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Bill  this  afternoon,
we are simultaneously fired with a great sense of celebration regarding  the
48 years of the living ideals of the Freedom Charter. The  Freedom  Charter,
upon whose ideals we seek to reconstruct  our  society,  proceeds  from  the
recognition that this country belongs to  all  those  who  live  in  it.  It
envisages a society based on the  principles  of  equality,  where  all  can
share in the country's wealth.

Based on the history of inequalities  created  by  the  legacy  of  colonial
oppression,  conscious  action  must  be  taken  to  undo  this  legacy   of
inequalities and, indeed, the ANC-led Government  has  the  mandate  of  the
people of this country to do that.  There  is  no  problem  with  that,  hon
Lever, and we are going to proceed with that mandate.

The Bill before this House today marks yet another  watershed  in  the  long
marathon to undo the inequalities of the past. The Bill aims to establish  a
legal framework for the promotion of economic transformation  in  order  to,
amongst others, enable meaningful  participation  of  black  people  in  the
economy; achieve substantial change in the racial composition  of  ownership
and management of the economy; and to promote access to  finance  for  black
economic empowerment.

In pursuit of the broad objectives of this Bill, there will be  an  advisory
council, as the Minister has already alluded to, that will, amongst  others,
review and monitor  the  progress  in  the  achievement  of  black  economic
empowerment. Allow me just to make a few comments.  I  expected  the  DA  to
oppose the Bill on the basis of its original intentions as they were  raised
in the committee - the intentions around the definition of ``black'' in  the
Bill. However, the DA have not  raised  that.  They  have  raised  an  issue
around their mistrust regarding the ability of  the  Government  to  appoint
its own yes men. I want to advise hon Lever and  his  colleagues  that  they
must create their own government where they can appoint their own yes men.

As the ANC, we are not going to deterred in our determination  and  will  to
transform the economic  relations  in  this  country.  The  Bill  gives  the
Minister the power to  issue  codes  of  good  practice  on  black  economic
empowerment that may include, amongst  others,  further  interpretation  and
definition of broad-based  black  economic  empowerment  and  categories  of
black empowerment entities, and also give qualification for the criteria  of
preferential purposes of procurement. This will go a long  way  in  adapting
and refining the Act in line with the changing conditions.

The Bill also empowers the Minister to issue a  comprehensive  strategy  for
broad-based black economic empowerment that will provide for an  integrated,
co-ordinated and uniform approach to empowerment  by  state  organs,  public
entities, the private  sector,  nongovernmental  organisations,  communities
and other stakeholders.

Whilst the Bill is a product  of  extensive  consultation  and  has  enjoyed
wider support amongst the roleplayers, it is,  however,  worth  noting  that
the DA has masqueraded behind the question of mistrust  on  the  appointment
of the advisory council in order to oppose this  Bill.  Their  objection  to
the Bill is reminiscent of their own slogan, the slogan of fighting  back  -
fighting  back  who?  That  slogan  is  about  fighting   the   historically
disadvantaged majority of this country, and fighting the  Africans  of  this
country by  retaining  the  status  quo  and  the  privilege  of  the  elite
minority. As the ANC, we are not going to bow to that  particular  pressure.
On the basis of this, I want to persuade the House to  vote  for  this  Bill
without any reservation. I thank you. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Chairperson, the  late  Kwame  Nkrumah
had a very well-known axiom which says  that  once  you  get  the  political
kingdom, everything automatically falls in place. It is an axiom  which  has
been proved to be  not  entirely  correct  in  the  sense  that  after  that
political kingdom, you have to strive for  economic  kingdom,  and  this  is
what we are actually doing.

The broad philosophical objective of the Bill in front of this House  is  to
promote the economic unity of the nation,  protect  the  common  market  and
promote equal opportunity and  equal  access  to  Government  services.  The
economic kingdom that I am talking about therefore means to increase  broad-
based and effective participation of the black people in  the  economy;  and
to promote a higher growth rate, increased  employment  and  more  equitable
income. I think this is the most fundamental philosophical  objective  which
the IFP is very much amenable to; in other words, we agree  with  that  very
much.

However,  the  BEE  enterprises  will  not  meaningfully  succeed   if   the
traditional financing institutions and the state-owned  parastatals  do  not
actually provide friendly, reasonable and manageable  interest  rates.  And,
what we see now and again are our BEE enterprises  collapsing  in  front  of
us, Mr Minister. It is not an interesting thing and we know that one of  the
contributing factors to that is the  interest  rates  which  have  not  been
actually structured to help our people.

According to Business Map, for instance, the market capitalisation of black-
controlled companies is only 3% of the JSE,  and  according  to  Empowerdex,
there has been little increase in black ownership at the JSE.  Figures  show
that black-owned initiatives on the JSE are not keeping up  well.  According
to this report, there will be a significant decline in black  representation
on the JSE by the end of this year.

I found these findings quite disturbing. They make me begin to ask  what  it
is that we should do to ensure that this wonderful dream comes to  fruition,
so that we can move away from what our President once said about  a  country
of two nations and begin to develop a country of one nation.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Thank you very much, Mr Chairperson, hon Minister  and  the
honourable House.

The argument propounded by this Bill is an economically sound one.  It  says
very  clearly  that  our  country's  economy  cannot  operate  to  its  full
potential because the majority of its people earn very low incomes  and  are
still excluded from the ownership of fixed  assets  and  the  possession  of
advanced skills. This is an indisputable fact. The argument that this  state
of affairs is to the detriment of all South Africans is also very clear  and
understandable.

So what is it that needs to be done? What collective measures are  on  offer
under these circumstances? The Bill provides for the necessary steps  to  be
taken to increase  the  effective  participation  of  the  majority  in  the
economy. Can we, for argument's sake, imagine in  an  agricultural  setup  a
camp with green grass, water and other nutritious licks, but  with  most  of
the cattle shut out of this camp so that  only  a  few  are  able  to  enter
through a narrow gate?

What needs to be done is to broaden access to  the  camp  so  that  as  many
cattle as possible can enter  and  enjoy  the  fattening  products  and  new
concentrates that are  there  for  them.  Similarly,  the  Bill  before  the
honourable House seeks to broaden access to the economic field  so  that  as
many blacks as possible can get to play their part.

The Black Economic Empowerment Advisory Council would be set  up  to  advise
the  Minister.  Otherwise,  the  UCDP  supports  the  Bill.  I  thank   you.
[Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: In a manner of speaking, Chairman,  Minister,  I  agree  with
the hon colleague who has just sat down. I think that we would like  to  see
the black cattle, the white cattle, the black and white cattle  and  all  of
the cattle in the field. [Interjections.] He put it much better than I do.

You see, Minister, we need to build this economy and  we  need  a  national,
broad-based, overarching, national economic  identity  that  binds  us  all,
that builds us all, that prospers and empowers us  all,  motivates  us  all,
encourages everyone, shuts out no one and obstructs no one. To that  extent,
I think, in a sense, that is what the Bill is doing.

What we don't like is the allusion to  race.  We  simply  don't  like  that.
Technically, for people, many of us who spent our lives trying to  end  that
debate in South Africa, when it comes back  at  us  like  that,  we're  just
allergic to it, Minister, if I must be honest with you.

As far as the objectives are  concerned,  the  only  thing  amiss  in  them,
Minister, is that the word ``growth'' appears  nowhere.  I  know  you  might
say, ``Ipso facto, that's what we are trying to achieve''.  The  reality  is
that it doesn't, in fact, appear anywhere among the objectives of the  Bill,
and we believe that our  ability  to  employ  our  people,  our  ability  to
elevate our people and our ability to uplift our people must be  in  growth.
It is only general economic  growth  that  will  lift  all  boats  in  South
Africa. Even if it's wrong, the impression that it is exclusive somehow,  or
partial, I think, is counterproductive.

You know, we can sit here trying to be  rude  to  each  other,  particularly
with the election coming, and we can beat the tribal drum  and  so  on,  but
actually there's consensus in this House. If you listened to  Mr  Lever,  he
was actually supporting you, Minister, and I think  that's  great.  I  think
it's wonderful. [Interjections.] He was, let's be fair.  He's  my  political
opponent also, but let's divide on the things that we genuinely don't  agree
on. [Time expired.]

Mr T S SETONA: Mr Chairperson, will the hon member take a question?

Mr K D S DURR: I will welcome any opportunity to extend my speaking time.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Unfortunately,  your
time has expired. [Interjections.] Order! Order!

Ms N D NTWANAMBI: Chairperson, people must just know that I  will  speak  in
isiXhosa. So nixhobe [be prepared.]  I  left  my  English  at  home,  for  a
change.

Chairperson, Minister and hon members, I want to begin by saying that ...

... thina be ANC siwuxhasa  kakhulu  lo  Mthetho  uYilwayo  kuba  uneenjongo
zokukhuthaza abantu ukuba  bavuke  bazenzele.  Kwakhona,  Mhlalingaphambili,
kukho imibutho engahambisaniyo nalo Mthetho uYilwayo, njengoko sele  sivile,
kuba ijonge ukukhusela oko yakufumana ngokungekho  mthethweni.  Akukho  mgca
uthi  baza  kuhluthwa  nto,  koko   abazange   bakwazi   ukuphucula   abantu
kwasekuqaleni.

Ndifuna ukubuza lo mbuzo, Mhlali-ngaphambili, kwaba bathi bamele  amaKrestu:
Ngaba bakulungele na  ukwabelana  kwanokuphuhlisa  abo  bangabaqeshwa  babo?
Okanye, ngaba bazimisele  kwinto  yokuba  abaqeshwa  bahlale  bengabaqeshwa,
bengena sabelo kwezo fama okanye kwezo nkampani zabo? Ndifun'  ukuthi  kwaba
bantu  bangamaKristu,  ndinguye  nam,   eZulwini   ayikho   indawo   yabantu
abangabaziyo  abanye  abantu,  yaye  eZulwini  kulawula  ooLazaro,   ooDivas
bayatsha. [Uwele-wele.]

Lo Mthetho uYilwayo  ulungiselela  bonke  abantu,  ngakumbi  abo  babevinjwe
amathuba  enkqubela   nempucuko   ngabo   babesemagunyeni.   Utsho   okokuba
uRhulumente uza kuthabatha  uxanduva  lokubona  ukuba  amathuba  anikwa  abo
bafuna ukungenela ushishino olusemthethweni. Akukho Mzantsi Afrika uya  kuba
nemigodi yakwaOppenheimer kuphela, okanye uthotho lweevenkile  zomntu  omnye
ngenxa yokuba enebala elikhanya ukudlula abanye.

Xa ndigqibezela,  Mhlalingaphambili,  mandilumkise  abo  basandula  ukungena
emtshatweni ongengcwele, okokuba akwaba  bebesazi  ukuba  bazimanye  nabantu
abawuchasayo lo Mthetho uYilwayo. Mandilitsolise, Mhlalingaphambili,  ndithi
i``Demolition Alliance'' izimanya nabantu abamele ukuphuculwa ngulo  Mthetho
uYilwayo. Okanye mandiphinde ndiyiguqule ndithi, xa  i-IFP  itshata  nabantu
abangoofunz'   eweni   nabandlela   zisoloko   zanxaxha,   njengaba,   ngaba
ibiyiqondisisile na into eyenzayo, kuba itshate  nabantu  abangena  zinjongo
zakuphucula abo babevinjwe amathuba?

Kungakuhle ukuba umtshato, xa ungasekwanga yiNkosi,  ukhawuleze  uwuqhawule.
Hleze  niphele  ningumbutho  weenkokeli,  abalandeli  bemke  baya  kuzimanya
nombutho   onguwo   wodwa   omele   abantu.    Enkosi,    Mhlalingaphambili.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[... we in the ANC fully support this Bill  because  it  aims  to  encourage
people to stand up and do things for themselves. Again,  Chairperson,  there
are parties that oppose this Bill,  as  we  have  heard,  because  they  are
trying to protect their ill-gotten gains. Nowhere in the Bill  does  it  say
that they are going to lose certain rights. Its just that  from  the  outset
they showed that they were unable to develop the people.

I would like to direct a question, Chairperson, to these  people  who  claim
to represent Christians: Are they prepared to share  with  and  train  their
employees? Or do they want their employees to remain just  that,  employees,
without any shares in the farms or companies employing them?  I  would  like
to say to these Christians - I am one myself - that in Heaven  there  is  no
place for people who do not care about other people, and that in Heaven  the
Lazarusses reign supreme and the Diveses burn.

This  Bill  caters  for  everybody,  particularly  those  who  were   denied
opportunities for development by the apartheid governments.  Government  has
stated that it will take upon  itself  the  responsibility  to  ensure  that
opportunities go to those who  want  to  participate  in  legal  businesses.
South Africa will not have a situation where only Oppenheimer has mines,  or
where one person has a monopoly of a certain industry just because he is  of
a much lighter hue than everyone else.

In conclusion, Chairperson, let me warn those who have just entered into  an
unholy alliance, that they are  aligning  themselves  with  people  who  are
opposed to the Bill. Let  me  state  categorically,  Chairperson,  that  the
"Demolition Alliance" is entering into an alliance with  people  who  should
benefit from this Bill. In  other  words,  when  the  IFP  entered  into  an
alliance with devious people with crooked ways, did they  stop  to  consider
their decision, because they've entered into an  alliance  with  people  who
have no plans to develop those that were denied opportunities?

It is only proper that when not  blessed  by  God,  an  alliance  should  be
ended, otherwise you  will  end  up  leading  your  own  jackets,  with  the
followers having gone to join the only  party  that  has  the  interests  of
people at heart. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chair, may I  first  deal  with  certain
issues which, I believe, can be easily clarified and, hopefully, also  allay
some of the concerns raised, and then I would like to spend  a  few  moments
dealing with what I believe is the fallacious position of the DA.

Let  me  say  that,  in  regard  to  uncertainty  of  our   black   economic
empowerment, obviously, when you change policy, I  think,  there  is  always
that potential. However, I think we have managed to allay  that  uncertainty
considerably. The hon Conroy quoted a statement from International  Investor
Council. These very experienced business leaders, I think,  indicated  quite
clearly that if we hadn't undertaken this policy,  we  probably  would  have
had more problems than by undertaking it, and also that they  supported,  as
I indicated, the pragmatic manner in which we are doing that.

Let me also clarify the matter with  regard  to  these  ``South  Africans''.
This  legislation  applies  to  South  Africans,   citizens   or   permanent
residents. For the sake of consistency, in the legislation we  used  African
as it's defined in the Employment Equity Act. However,  when  you  read  the
strategy document, including the scorecard, it  makes  it  clear  that  this
applies to South Africans. This has been the  matter  on  which  we've  been
approached by other countries and  other  governments.  The  Government  has
made it clear that this applies  to  South  African  citizens  or  permanent
residents of the country. The reasons for that, I think, are pretty  obvious
as to why it needs to be done in that manner.

Let  me  deal  briefly  with  the  matter  of  financing.  Hon  Bhengu,  the
Government's approach has been  consistent  on  this  matter  and  I  think,
increasingly, you see considerable amounts of finance being made  available.
What we don't believe would be correct is  to  create  an  artificially  low
interest rate for the black entrepreneur. The reason is a  very  clear  one:
paying interest is an expense. You have to pay off each month and  each  day
whatever it is that you have to pay. If you  were  to  lower  that  interest
rate at some point and then raise it, you would be creating  uncertainty  in
the business environment because the business would not be geared to  paying
what the market rate is. Then, suddenly, when it has to pay it,  you  create
a problem.

This is a  worldwide  experience  that  heavily  subsidised  interest  rates
create two kinds of problems. One is  the  problem  for  the  business.  The
business itself often runs into difficulties later. The second  is  a  major
problem  for  government  because  it  has  an  open-ended  exposure   about
subsidising interest rates. It's that  very  exposure  which  increases  the
perception of risk and which increases interest rates again. So, you  get  a
very dangerous circle that can emerge: Whereas interest  rates  go  up,  the
government has to pay more,  and  because  the  government  pays  more,  the
interest rates carry on going high.

So, you can see that our Government's approach to  macroeconomic  policy  is
stability, not instability. This is why the assistance that we give  to  BEE
is usually in the form of assisting with start-up grants, or  increasing  in
the form of giving guarantees in  support  for  the  loans  taken.  I  would
appeal that we see and accept  the  problems  of  finance.  Yes,  there  are
different problems, but  we  will  not  take  the  course  of  a  subsidised
interest rate.

Regarding hon Durr, well, I'm sorry, we have to deal with  the  race  issue.
As this Government has shown and as the ANC  has  shown,  we  are  the  most
profoundly committed organisation to nonracism. However, it is black  people
who were discriminated against. We, therefore, have some way to  bring  them
into the economy. I'd also stress to you that, in the Act, we may  not  make
mention  to  growth  because  the  objectives  deal  with   black   economic
empowerment. However, any reading of the strategy documents  will  show  how
strong our commitment is to the concept that growth and development have  to
go hand in hand and, in my statement today  in  the  National  Assembly,  we
stressed this point and the President  stressed  it  in  his  state  of  the
nation address. So, I really think that we can give  you  comfort  in  those
areas and we are making progress here.

The final point  I  would  like  to  make  is  that,  really,  there's  real
hypocrisy in the position. Hon Durr thinks that  the  DA  agrees  with  this
approach. Let me argue the contrary position:  I  think  that  there's  real
hypocrisy in the position. In this House and the other  House  they  purport
to support the objectives and then develop  what  are  essentially  spurious
arguments against it.

What are the spurious arguments? There have been  two  that  have  been  put
forward. The one is that the definition of black is too  narrow  and  should
be  related  to  a  means  test.  However,  this  is  about  black  economic
empowerment for skilled professionals, for people who are  going  to  own  a
business and for managers. Now, what are we doing if we set the means  test?
It just makes no sense. The means test  deals  with  another  problem  which
this Government has massively committed itself to, and that is helping  poor
people, but here we are talking about economic  empowerment.  Now,  you  are
saying that we must only empower those people who  are  poor  and  we  can't
empower anyone else? It's a spurious argument designed  to  find  an  excuse
for not supporting this.

The second argument, too, is spurious. To argue that people of  the  calibre
of Cyril Ramaphosa are  immediately  fat  cats  and  therefore  suspect  is,
really, to profoundly misunderstand that most of the finest people in  South
Africa, particularly the finest black people in South Africa, supported  the
ANC. Why did they support the ANC? Because they were people who  knew  that,
fundamentally, racism was wrong. Good people, great people,  mature  people,
inspired and idealistic people believe  that.  Quite  obviously,  when  they
come into the open economy, they will also be leaders in  this  economy.  To
say that these people have not made a massive contribution  to  our  economy
is really wrong. Any government would appoint experienced  and  good  people
to a board, but when we appoint them, suddenly it's the ANC.

Both of these arguments are profoundly fallacious, and I would  submit  that
we always have these arguments in the DA for two reasons. One  is  that,  as
an opposition, the only thing that they can do - on every single  issue,  no
matter how useful and no matter how it stands for building the nation  -  is
to oppose. In the  House,  the  other  day,  the  President  dealt  with  an
extremely sensitive matter, and what did the DA person do? He stood  up  and
made a stupid point. When we  try  to  deal  with  the  essence  of  nation-
building and problem issues, they don't see that. So, anything that the  ANC
does, the DA will oppose. This is what undermines the  DA  as  a  legitimate
and useful opposition in this country. [Interjections.]

Secondly, I believe that regarding everything that we try and  do  to  bring
about transformation for our nation, the DP is always opposed  to  it.  That
is the truth behind the DA,  and  you  should  reflect  on  it.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

        PROMOTION OF NATIONAL UNITY AND RECONCILIATION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, to some people it's still a miracle how  we
managed to smoothly move away from our ugly past to where we are today.

After the 1994 elections, the people's Government deemed it fit  and  proper
that something had to be done by all South Africans, especially victims  and
perpetrators, to honestly and openly talk about  their  past.  For  that  to
happen, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and  the  Amnesty  Committee
were the answer.

Indeed, people used that platform effectively. A lot was revealed.  That  is
why good doctors, like Dr Conroy, will advise you  that  if  you  cough  out
whatever is troubling you, you will feel relieved and healed. In  1995,  the
Promotion of National Unity  and  Reconciliation  Act  was  passed  by  this
Parliament. It is a  known  fact  that  a  lot  was  achieved  through  that
process. People who could not see eye to eye have reconciled and are now  on
good speaking terms. The majority of applications of those who  applied  for
amnesty were successful. This process was like our traditional courts  whose
aim is not just to punish people, but to reconcile them.

The Bill, amongst other things, wants to deal with those identified  victims
and communities who suffered the injustices of the past. The Bill  makes  it
possible for some amounts to be  paid  to  some  people  identified  by  the
commission. Again, they shall be paid from the funds,  all  amounts  payable
by  way  of  reparations  towards  the  rehabilitation  of  communities   as
prescribed.

The Bill also enables sympathetic, progressive and patriotic individuals  or
companies to make some contributions or donations towards  the  same  cause.
This can be  in  a  form  of  buildings,  schools,  hospitals,  recreational
facilities or any other assistance to the affected community. No  price  can
equal the suffering, sacrifice and  pain  endured  by  our  people  and  our
leaders. This is just a gesture to say we acknowledge or recognise the  role
that they played.

When the commission and Amnesty Committee closed shop, it  later  discovered
that there were still cases that were pending for various reasons. The  Bill
makes it possible for the Minister to appoint a subcommittee  to  deal  with
such instances. The Bill also allows the Minister to, by way of a notice  in
the Gazette, correct any error in names published by the commission.

I think that I have tried to simplify what  this  Bill  is  all  about.  Hon
members, you are all aware that there are many people out  there  who  await
the passing of this Bill. I know you  cannot  disappoint  them.  I  now,  on
behalf  of  my  select  committee,  commit  this  Bill  before  the   House.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

         CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AMENDMENT BILL

  (Debate on particulars of proposed amendments in terms of 74(5)(c) of the
                                Constitution)

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, comrades, the amendment  that
we propose  today  aims  to  create  a  constitutional  foundation  for  two
envisaged changes that relate to our  superior  courts.  Those  changes  are
contained in the Superior Courts Bill.

The first change is aimed at combining  the  various  existing  High  Courts
into a unitary structure, namely a single High Court of  South  Africa.  The
second change makes  provision  for  the  appointment  of  a  second  deputy
president of the Supreme Court of Appeal to manage labour  appeals  in  that
court. Before 1994, in the old South Africa, we had Supreme Courts of  South
Africa which consisted of the Appellate Division and various provincial  and
local divisions that functioned in terms of the Supreme Court Act  of  1959.
The former TBVC states had similar  Supreme  Courts  that  functioned  under
largely corresponding legislation.
As you know, the interim Constitution introduced  the  Constitutional  Court
as the apex court in constitutional matters. In addition,  it  retained  the
Supreme Court  structure,  but  abolished  those  appellate  divisions  that
existed in the TBVC states. The 1996 Constitution  converted  the  Appellate
Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa to the existing Supreme  Court
of Appeal. It also converted each  provincial  and  local  division  of  the
former Supreme Court of South Africa and each Supreme  Court  of,  I  quote,
``a homeland'' into a separate High Court. This  change  was  in  line  with
section 167 of the Constitution which states that the courts are inter  alia
the High Courts, and section 169  which  states  that  any  High  Court  may
decide certain matters.

The Constitution left one anomaly, though, in so far as it stated that  when
considering a matter that specifically relates to  a  provincial  and  local
division of the High Court, the  judge  president  of  that  division  is  a
member of the commission. This anomaly was addressed in the Constitution  of
the Republic of South Africa Amendment Act  of  2001  that  substituted  the
reference to a provincial or local division  of  the  High  Court  with  the
reference to a specific High Court. Notwithstanding the amendment  in  2001,
the original wording of section 178(1)(k) begged the  question  whether  the
drafters of the Constitution  consciously  intended  to  divide  the  former
unitary structure of  the  Supreme  Court  of  South  Africa  into  distinct
separate High Courts.

As a result of this separation, the question can be raised whether  a  judge
of a specific High Court can be transferred  horizontally  to  another  High
Court  without  again  having  to  be  interviewed   and   recommended   for
appointment by the Judicial Service Commission. The steering  committee  for
the rationalisation of the courts, led by the chief justice, holds the  view
that the establishment of a single High Court of  South  Africa,  comprising
various  divisions,  will  be  better  aligned   with   the   principle   of
establishing a single judiciary, and would rather underscore  the  principle
that the administration of justice is a national competence.

The Labour Court and Labour Appeal Court  were  established  by  the  Labour
Relations Act, sections 157 and 173 respectively. The judges of  the  Labour
Court comprise a judge president who must be a judge of the High  Court  and
who is also a judge president of the Labour Appeal Court, and  other  judges
who must be High Court  judges  or  legal  practitioners  appointed  by  the
President on the advice of Nedlac and the Judicial Service Commission.

The Labour Appeal Court comprises the said judge president  and  High  Court
judges who are also appointed by the President upon  the  advice  of  Nedlac
and the JSC. Since all judges of the Labour Court are not  also  High  Court
judges, there are differences in respect of security of tenure. Unlike  High
Court judges who hold that office for life, judges of the Labour  Court  are
appointed for a fixed term. This makes it  difficult  to  attract  the  best
candidates to the Labour Court as those persons are  hesitant  to  interrupt
their careers  to  serve  as  Labour  Court  judges.  Those  who  aspire  to
appointment to the Bench would much rather  accept  an  appointment  in  the
High Courts where they will, on the one hand, be exposed  to  the  diversity
of the law associated  with  that  office,  and  on  the  other  hand  enjoy
security of tenure for life. This also leads to a perceived inferior  status
of the non-High Court judges.

The High Court judges who are also judges of the  Labour  Court  and  Labour
Appeal Court are faced with a different challenge in that they,  in  effect,
serve two masters. They must apply themselves to the duties associated  with
their particular High Courts and simultaneously  avail  themselves  to  hear
matters in the Labour Court. Legally, a strong argument could be  made  that
section 173 of the Labour  Relations  Act  which  bestows  exclusive  appeal
jurisdiction on labour matters on the Labour  Appeal  Courts  is,  in  fact,
unconstitutional.

Section 168(3) of the  Constitution  provides  that  the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal is the highest court of appeal,  except  in  constitutional  matters.
Another constitutional problem lies in the fact that section 166(e)  of  the
Constitution allows for a  court  of  similar  status  to  the  High  Court,
whereas section 173 of the Labour Relations Act purports to create a  Labour
Appeal Court as a court of similar status to the Supreme  Court  of  Appeal,
ie of a higher status than the High Courts.

This has led to some confusion regarding the jurisdiction and status of  the
Labour Appeal Court, and the judgment  regarding  this  issue  is  currently
pending in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Furthermore,  the  proliferation  of
courts  established  at  the  High  Court  level,  which  have  specifically
confined areas of jurisdiction, different selection criteria in  respect  of
judges and, in some cases, different conditions of employment than those  of
the High Court judges, is a matter of concern to the  department  and  other
role-players who act in the administration of justice.

The  proliferation  of  these   courts   is   detrimental   to   the   sound
administration of justice and particularly to the coherent development of  a
cost-efficient court structure and, ultimately,  to  the  development  of  a
single judiciary model. Following a process of extensive  consultation  with
the  Judge  President  of  the  Labour  Court,  Justice   Zondo,   and   the
representatives of Nedlac, the steering committee has adopted  the  Superior
Courts Bill in order to make provisions for  the  abolition  of  the  Labour
Court and Labour Appeal Court.

The Bill bestows jurisdiction in labour matters on the High Court  of  South
Africa, whilst labour appeals would be dealt with in the  Supreme  Court  of
Appeal. However, the specialist nature of labour  adjudication  is  affirmed
by establishing a panel of specially selected judges  who  may  hear  labour
matters. Provision is also made for the appointment to the Supreme Court  of
Appeal of a second deputy president who will be  responsible  primarily  for
managing labour appeals in the Supreme Court of Appeal. This seems to  clear
up the matters and it does prepare us, in the long-term vision, for  justice
and the administration of justice as a department, and for our  clients  who
are not only the public, but the judges who serve in those courts.
I stand in support of this Bill and  I  trust  that  the  debate  will  also
support the approval of this Bill by  the  National  Council  of  Provinces.
[Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Ke hole boha Mohlomphehi Modulasetulo. [Thank  you,  hon
Chairperson.]

It is not an enviable task to follow after the hon Deputy Minister  in  this
debate given her thorough exposition of  the  proposed  amendments  and  the
underlying principle thereof.

Since the Bill is sort of linked to the model  for  the  rationalisation  of
our courts being proposed in the Supreme Court Bill, one could  be  forgiven
for falling into a trap, so to speak, of appearing  to  debate  the  Supreme
Court Bill rather than the Constitution of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa
Amendment Bill that is the subject of this discussion for this afternoon.

Our Constitution pays considerable attention  to  our  legal  framework  and
particularly to our judiciary, since the judicial authority of the  Republic
forms the third  tier  of  government  alongside  the  legislature  and  the
executive. It is the judicial authority who, in  the  final  instance,  must
uphold and interpret the Constitution. It  is  therefore  almost  inevitable
that when major structural  changes  to  our  courts  are  envisaged,  those
changes will have to be synchronised with Chapter 8 of our Constitution.  It
is also fitting, therefore, that the steering  committee  appointed  by  the
hon Minister for Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  to  develop  the
proposals in question, carried out its task under the auspices of the  chief
justice.

I  have  already  referred  to  the  fact  that   our   Constitution   deals
comprehensively with the composition of  the  courts.  I  suppose  that  one
could say, in a certain sense, that the price  you  pay  for  such  detailed
provision is that whenever those  details  are  sought  to  be  changed  and
regardless of the scope of those changes, the Constitution itself  needs  to
be amended.

The proposed Bill amends the Constitution in two parts, the two parts  which
were correctly spelled out by the hon  Deputy  Minister.  Let  me  not  bore
members by repeating exactly what she said.

Lastly, it should be recognised that the amendments being  proposed  in  the
Constitutional Amendment  Bill  seek  to  sanction  the  changes  which  are
presently being contemplated in the Superior Courts Bill and,  consequently,
we need to be informed about any major changes that might still be  effected
to that piece of legislation during the course of its  passage  through  the
House and Parliament as a whole.

As a committee we sat and discussed this Bill, and there was consensus  that
instead of wasting time, we should task one member to make a statement,  but
then we said that people of this country need  to  know  exactly  what  this
Bill is all about. That is the reason why we are debating this.

I have tasked my two soldiers, Matthee and Maloi, and a  third  one,  Lever,
to do justice to it by outlining a few things which are  to  be  changed  in
this Bill. On that note, let me rest my case and allow my soldiers  to  take
over from where I left off. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek volg graag op my voorsitter. [Chairperson,  I
take pleasure in following after my chairperson.]

I would like to start off by quoting from  Item  6  of  Schedule  6  of  our
Constitution, which really lays the basis of this amending  Bill,  where  it
says: ``that as soon as  is  practical  after  the  new  Constitution  takes
effect, all courts, including their  structure,  composition,  function  and
jurisdiction and all relevant legislation must be rationalised with  a  view
to establishing a judicial system suited to  the  requirements  of  the  new
Constitution.''

This is what this is all about and, as the Deputy  Minister  has  explained,
this is to make it possible for the Bill which will also come to us  in  the
near future. She has dealt with the Bill in quite some  detail  and  I  will
therefore not repeat anything that she has said.

Een van die heel belangrikste, indien nie dié  belangrikste  pilare  van  'n
effektiewe konstitusionele demokrasie en 'n regstaat soos ons  s'n  nie,  is
sekerlik die oppergesag van die reg, wat internasionaal meer  bekend  is  as
die ``rule of law'', soos  wat  dit  ook  blyk  uit  Artikel  1(c)  van  ons
Grondwet. Hierdie wysiging van die Grondwet sal hopelik, en dit is  ook  die
motivering daaragter, die verdere uitbouing van  hierdie  beginsel  bevorder
en tot groter toeganklikheid tot die reg deur al ons mense bydra.

Ons as openbare verteenwoordigers van ons mense behoort onsself  voortdurend
af te vra hoe ons die toegang van ons regstelsel vir al  ons  al  mense  kan
uitbrei sodat elke burger, insluitende al  ons  kinders,  werklik  effektief
gelyke beskerming deur die reg kan kry soos  uiteengesit  in  die  voorwoord
tot ons Grondwet. Dit wil sê, beskerming  teen  misdadigers  wat  hulle  nog
heeltemal te veel besteel, aanrand, verkrag en vermoor, ten  spyte  van  die
goeie nuus dat die tendens aan die afneem is, en ook  om  hulle  te  beskerm
teen gewetenlose uitbuiters wat hulle op groot skaal nog ekonomies uitbuit.

In 'n regstaat soos ons s'n behoort ons dit werklik te oorweeg  om  'n  nuwe
skoolvak soos basiese inleiding tot die reg in te stel en  dit  ook  by  ons
universiteite en kolleges aan te beid as deel van  buitemuurse  en  volwasse
opleiding. Die doel daarvan moet wees slegs om die bevolking bewus  te  maak
van hulle regte en hoe hulle toegang tot die reg kan kry,  wat  ons  hopelik
nou deur hierdie wysiging van ons Grondwet verder sal kan  uitbrei  en  meer
toeganklik kan kry.

Daar behoort terselfdertyd sorg gedra te word dat  die  regsprofessie  altyd
'n uitdagende en aantreklike loopbaanrigting bly  vir  ons  jeug  sodat  die
allerbelangrikste pilaar van ons demokrasie, naamlik die oppergesag van  die
reg, of ``die rule of law'', altyd in Suid-Afrika sal  gedy,  want  dit  is,
per slot van rekening, die grootste waarborg vir elkeen van  ons,  vir  elke
burger en elke kind  in  Suid-Afrika  vir  'n  vooruitstrewende  en  veilige
demokrasie waarin elke Suid-Afrikaner tot sy of haar  volle  potensiaal  sal
kan ontwikkel. Ek dank u. [Applous.] (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[One of the most important,  if  not  the  most  important,  pillars  of  an
effective constitutional democracy and a constitutional state such as  ours,
is surely the supreme authority of the law, which is  known  internationally
as the  rule  of  law,  as  is  also  apparent  from  article  1(c)  of  our
Constitution. This amendment to the Constitution will  hopefully,  and  this
is also the motivation  thereto,  further  promote  the  extension  of  this
principle and contribute to greater accessibility to  the  law  by  all  our
people.

We, as public representatives  of  our  people,  ought  to  continually  ask
ourselves how we could possibly extend accessibility  to  the  judiciary  to
all our people so that  every  citizen,  including  all  our  children,  can
really be equally and effectively protected by the law, as set  out  in  the
preamble to our Constitution. In other words, protection from criminals  who
are robbing, assaulting, raping and murdering them much too easily,  despite
the good news that the tendency is waning, and  moreover,  to  protect  them
from unscrupulous exploiters who  are  preying  on  them  on  a  huge  scale
economically.

In  a  constitutional  state  such  as  ours,  we  should  really   consider
introducing a new school subject such as basic introduction to the  law  and
to also make this available at our universities  and  colleges  as  part  of
extramural and adult training. The objective of this  should  merely  be  to
make people aware of their rights and how they can gain access to  the  law,
and we will now hopefully be able to extend this even further  through  this
amendment of our Constitution, and achieve access.

At the same time we should  make  sure  that  the  legal  profession  always
remains a challenging and attractive career path for our youth so  that  the
most important pillar of our democracy, namely the supreme authority of  the
law or the rule of law, will always flourish in  South  Africa,  because  it
ultimately is the biggest guarantee for every one of us, for  every  citizen
and every child in South Africa, of a  progressive  and  safe  democracy  in
which every South African can develop to his or her full potential. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Thank you, Chairperson, the hon  Kgoshi  Mokoena  pointed  out
how difficult it was  to  follow  on  the  Deputy  Minister's  comprehensive
exposition of what this Bill entails. It is indeed true, and the hon  Kgoshi
has a way out by appointing us, his traditional warriors -  my  hon  friends
and colleagues Mr Maloyi and Mr Matthee and I - to take it  further.  I  was
also hoping the hon Matthee would use only one language.

Dan kon ek dieselfde punt in die ander taal gemaak  het.  Hy  het  in  albei
tale sy punt gestel. [Then I could have made the same  point  in  the  other
language. He stated his case in both languages.]

So, my only consolation at this stage is that the task of the hon Maloyi  is
somewhat more difficult because he has to find something new  to  say  after
the Deputy Minister, Kgoshi Mokoena, Mr Matthee and myself. [Laughter.]

This  Bill,  as  hon  Matthee  pointed  out,  really  gives  effect  to  the
rationalisation process in schedule 6 to the Constitution. I can foresee  no
difficulty with it. It rationalises the courts as it is envisaged  with  the
Constitution and, clearly,  I  think  it  will  pass  through  the  National
Assembly when it is debated there. [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chairperson, the mistake I did was to write in English.  If
I had written it in Setswana, it was going to be easy because  I  was  going
to repeat what the Deputy Minister and Kgoshi Mokoena said and other  people
would not have understood what I was saying.

Anyway, let me start here: The  present  situation  with  our  courts  still
reflects the boundaries determined under apartheid.  Let  me  quickly  state
one practical example. Mdantsane and East London are  10  to  15  kilometres
from each other, yet Mdantsane falls within the jurisdisction of the  Ciskei
High Court and East London within the jurisdiction of the Eastern Cape  High
Court. It is,  therefore,  imperative  that  the  Superior  Courts  Bill  be
introduced in order for us to address this situation  which  is  irrational,
does not make any sense and which does not assist anybody and does not  meet
the demands of the local population.

The Superior Courts Bill, which I just spoke about and which I know  is  not
the issue we are debating today, attempts to remedy the  situation  which  I
have just indicated to you, but I think what the Deputy Minister did was  to
indicate all the problems, so I am not going to repeat what she just said.

This matter has been a dispute for several years within  various  groups  in
the legal fraternity. We were briefed by the  department,  and  they  talked
about the High Courts as contained in the  Constitution.  The  situation  is
that for a judge in the Cape High Court it is very difficult to  immediately
go and sit on the Bench in Pretoria. There might be certain problems.
The department even went to the extent  of  asking  Mr  Lever:  You  are  an
advocate of what? You know, all those issues cause a number of problems.

Now, the Superior Courts Bill is attempting to address  all  these  matters.
However, for us to pave the way for the Superior High  Courts  Bill,  it  is
more than necessary to amend the Constitution, hence the amendment which  we
are presenting to you today. I am happy that Mr Lever  and  the  DA,  for  a
change, agree with everything without any reservations.

It is, therefore, necessary for me to appeal to Mrs Versfeld  to  follow  in
the footsteps of Mr Lever and agree with the Bill as it is presented  to  us
today. [Applause.]

The  DEPUTY   MINISTER   FOR   JUSTICE   AND   CONSTITUTIONAL   DEVELOPMENT:
Chairperson, thank you very much for this very good debate  and  uncontested
debate - which is what I like most about  this.  However,  just  to  make  a
point: I think the reason that we all  agree  is  that  this  is  about  the
ongoing transformation  of  our  justice  system,  the  improvement  of  its
structure and the way that it functions. We will  also  supplement  this  by
transforming the judiciary that populates the architecture of  justice,  not
only in terms  of  representivity,  but  also  in  the  quality  of  service
experienced by the people of this country.

We then also have a supplementary process of judicial and legal reform,  and
we have new and progressive Bills. Some of the best legal structures in  the
world have been produced by this Parliament, and the  committee  process  is
really one of our success stories in the way that  they  fine-tune,  examine
and put under the microscope the legislation that comes before them.

At the end of the day we are trying to improve the service that we give  our
people, and I believe that today's  legislation  that  has  been  discussed,
will achieve this. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

      CONSIDERATION OF EIGHTH REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON AFRICAN UNION

                          (Consideration of Report)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Chairperson,  thank
you very much for giving me this opportunity to lead this debate.

Today we are gathered on the eve of Heritage  Day  to  review  the  progress
made in the establishment of the Pan-African Parliament and its  organs.  It
is not a coincidence that the debate on the  Pan-African  Parliament  should
be held today. As a country and a nation we have travelled a very long  road
to be where we are today.

Hon members would recall that this House passed a resolution establishing  a
working group on the Pan-African  Parliament  in  order  to  facilitate  the
ratification of the  Treaty  Establishing  the  African  Economic  Community
Relating to the Pan-African Parliament, and to enable members to  engage  in
issues relating to the establishment of the protocol.

Several reports have been tabled in the past on the progress made thus  far,
and today I would like to focus on the Eighth Report  which  is  before  the
House. It would be recalled  that  following  the  meeting  of  all  African
parliamentarians which Parliament hosted on  30  June  to  1  July  2003,  a
resolution was adopted calling on those countries which  had  not  deposited
their instruments of ratification, to do so by  31  December  2003.  Let  me
report that as at 30 July  2003,  21  countries  had  signed,  ratified  and
deposited their instruments.

Though there is progress, there are also challenges. In terms of article  22
of the protocol, the protocol shall  come  into  force  30  days  after  the
deposit of instruments of ratification by a simple  majority.  I  have  been
made to  understand  that  this  means  that  once  27  member  states  have
deposited their instruments,  the  Chairperson  of  the  African  Union,  in
consultation with the commission, may determine the beginning of  the  first
term of office of the Pan-African Parliament.

Before that happens, there is a lot of work that we have to  do  as  members
of Parliament. This includes, among other things, the drafting of the  rules
for the inauguration session. The protocol further provides that each  state
shall be represented by five members, at least one of whom must be a  woman.
It  also  provides  that  the  delegation  must  reflect  the  diversity  of
political opinions in each national parliament.  It  should  also  emphasise
that it was South Africa which argued for the inclusion of a  provision  for
the representation of at least three women in that  delegation.  We  support
this very strongly: that out of the five there should be three women who  go
to the Pan-African Parliament.

On the question of political representation, there are  two  options  before
the  working  group.  The  first  option  is  that  the  largest  party   be
represented by three members and two  members  from  among  other  political
parties. That is the first option we are putting forward to the  members  of
the House. The second option is that five parties with the  biggest  numbers
could have one member each. Then you would have  your  composition  of  five
members that will represent us at  the  Pan-African  Parliament.  These  are
some of the issues the working group still has to finalise, and members  are
urged to make their inputs.

The working group is still looking into the procedure  of  the  election  of
the delegates. This also includes the representation of the delegation  from
both Houses: the National Assembly and the National  Council  of  Provinces.
However, let me also emphasise that in terms of  the  protocol,  members  of
the executive shall not form part of the parliamentary delegation.  This  is
also in line with parliamentary delegations to most international forums.

In terms of article 6 of the protocol, members of the delegation to the Pan-
African Parliament vote in their  personal  and  independent  capacity.  The
working group noted that though the protocol might make  such  a  provision,
those members still are elected  to  represent  Parliament  and,  therefore,
need to be held accountable to Parliament.

As a result, the working group recommends that a  committee  be  established
to process and deal with the issues pertaining to the  African  Union.  This
could include  the  Southern  African  Development  Community  Parliamentary
Forum. The point here that I am trying to make is that those people who  are
going  to  the  Pan-African  Parliament  are  still  accountable   to   this
Parliament. We therefore need to find a mechanism as to how they account  to
Parliament,  how  they  get  the  mandates  and  how  they  report  back  to
Parliament. That mechanism will be in the form of establishing a  committee,
which will sort of scrutinise all these things, be a clearing mechanism  and
deal with those issues. These  are  the  proposals  at  the  present  moment
before the working group.

The other issue, perhaps, which is  very  important  for  this  debate,  and
which I would like to mention, is that article  5.4  of  the  protocol  does
provide for the recall of delegates. The working  group  recommends  that  a
procedure needs to be developed and  included  in  the  rules  of  the  Pan-
African Parliament for the recall  of  delegates.  These  are  some  of  the
mechanisms to ensure  that  those  members  who  will  be  representing  our
Parliament are accountable.

In other words, we need to design rules in such a manner that members  could
be recalled during that period if a  parliament  or  a  national  parliament
wishes to do so. Those rules will be within the purview of  the  rules  that
we shall have drafted and that we shall have agreed to as to what, when  and
how we recall those members and whether  they  are  replaceable  or  not.  I
think they will be replaceable anyway, because there will be  a  vacancy  in
terms of that national Parliament.

So there are quite a few issues, particularly issues  that  will  affect  us
during the inaugural day which, we think,  will  be  very  late  in  January
2004. These rules should be in place before the inaugural session that  will
be held next year.

It is very important that we should also look  at  how  these  members  will
take an oath. How they will be sworn in is another  very  important  aspect.
How are we going to create the committees? It  is  important  that  the  in-
house committees should actually  be  in  place.  Your  programme  committee
should be in place  on  that  day,  and  your  management  committee  should
perhaps be in place on that day too.

We also need to look at the rules committee to be established by  that  day,
so that during those three weeks that the  Pan-African  Parliament  will  be
sitting, the rules committee will be in a position to  begin  to  draft  the
rules that will guide the Pan-African Parliament.

However, one of the important issues that we also have to  look  at  is  the
question of the rules in terms of debate. What are the rules of  a  debating
forum like the one we are creating? How are we going to take the  decisions?
In terms of the committees, what will be their functions and  what  will  be
their roles? So these are the things that should be in place  before  we  go
to the inauguration ceremony in January.

In conclusion, let me also indicate that the working group has decided  that
we need to have a seminar before the end of the 2003  parliamentary  session
in order to enable members to have a meaningful discussion on the issues  of
the Pan-African Parliament. I can assure you that that seminar is  going  to
take place very soon. Members are urged, when the day is actually  given  to
them, to participate because we would need your views as we shape all  these
issues or discussions in the days leading up to the inauguration of the Pan-
African Parliament.

Lastly, let me also bring to the attention of members that there  will  soon
be a ninth report which will focus on the draft  rules  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament, and  members  are  urged  to  peruse  this  document.  Once  the
document is tabled in the ATC, I would request  that  members  look  further
into the ninth report and advise us immediately  of  the  issues  that  they
think we should take on or tackle upfront in the working group.

As the working group in the NCOP, a small group of  five,  we  also  try  to
meet on a weekly basis so that we can shape our ideas and  make  our  inputs
more meaningful as we go to  the  joint  working  group  with  the  National
Assembly. That concludes my report on this, Chairperson.  I  wish  to  thank
you very much. [Applause.]

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I have been involved in the working  group  on  the
African Union for quite a long time, albeit infrequently,  but  it  is  only
now  that  the  reality  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament  is  looming  very
definitely in the beginning of the year  2004  that  the  whole  process  is
shaping up as more reality than theory.

The Eighth Report is  already  being  followed  by  a  ninth  draft  report.
Recommendations from this report of the working group on the  African  Union
includes draft rules for the Pan-African  Parliament,  PAP.  This  includes,
and the PAP protocol provides for  it,  that  at  the  first  sitting  after
elections and before proceeding  with  any  other  matter,  the  Pan-African
parliamentarians shall take an oath or make a solemn declaration. This  will
apply to elected representatives, elected from among our own ranks.

What this brings home very clearly is that we are actually  embarking  on  a
new venture of African unity,  not  only  in  form,  but  of  purpose.  This
inevitably stirs very basic patriotic emotions, and I  immediately  want  to
be sure that South Africa takes a  commanding  role  -  a  reaction  against
which we obviously have to guard if we want co-operation.

This stage also brings with it as many questions as answers.  While  we  are
enthusiastically going on the chosen path of  furthering  African  unity  of
action and purpose, are we all sure of what it is  that  we  are  committing
ourselves to do?

The process of which I have been a part has been an exercise of caution  and
decorum, but nevertheless it is a  process  which  has  been  undertaken  on
behalf of African citizens, and I would venture to say that it is a  process
of which the vast majority are completely and blissfully unaware.

Therefore, while committing the DA fully to the concept and purpose  of  the
AU, I wish to reiterate the need for us to make sure that civil society  and
nongovernmental   organisations,   which   have   played   an   increasingly
influential role in  bringing  about  high  standards  of  transparency  and
accountability from  an  elected  government,  be  constantly  informed  and
involved as the process evolves.

This  cannot  be   an   exercise   for   the   aggrandisement   of   elected
representatives. It will serve no purpose if it does not serve the  ordinary
citizen. We must be very clear that we are  forming  the  proposed  regional
building blocks towards its continental unity on a variety of  fronts,  with
the express purpose of bettering the lives of  the  people  of  the  African
continent. It is with this proviso only that I  wholeheartedly  endorse  the
process on behalf of the DA. [Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, first of all I would like to thank  the  Deputy
Chairperson of the NCOP, Mr M J Mahlangu, for the leading role  that  he  is
playing in this working group on the AU, specifically as  far  as  the  Pan-
African Parliament is concerned. He is leading our delegation from the  NCOP
in those very important discussions.

The vision of our Department of Foreign Affairs, as set out in  a  document:
the operationalisation of the African Union and the  implementation  of  the
Nepad programmes, is the following - and I think it is important for all  of
us to first look at the vision of how we as South  Africans  look  at  this.
Our vision is -


  ... an African  continent  which  is  prosperous,  peaceful,  democratic,
  nonracial, nonsexist and united, and which contributes to a world that is
  just and equitable.

That is the vision with which  we  should  approach  our  work  as  we  move
rapidly towards the  implementation  of  the  protocol  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament.

As it has been pointed out and discussed, the Eighth Report is  the  subject
of our debate today. Various aspects thereof have been pointed out and  also
that we are already busy working on the draft ninth  report.  I  would  just
like to highlight one or two aspects. Members must also know  that  in  this
Eighth Report the conclusion or recommendation at  its  end  is  that  there
should be a seminar on all the issues dealt with and  discussed  before  the
end of this  parliamentary  session,  the  2003  parliamentary  session,  to
create an opportunity for all members to meaningfully  engage  on  the  Pan-
African Parliament issues.

The issues you have heard are very pressing, because it  is  envisaged  that
this Pan-African Parliament will actually come into being before the end  of
January next year. That really does not give us much time,  and  all  of  us
must know that this is a whole new chapter that  we  are  entering.  We,  as
Parliament, will have five members  of  Parliament,  and  may  I  also  say,
including members from the NCOP who will be representing  us  in  that  Pan-
African Parliament.

This brings me to something which I have thought about quite a lot of  late,
and that is that whilst we are now moving into this  new  era,  there  is  a
real need, and I think a necessity for us, to urge  representatives  of  our
people to interact with our counterparts on the rest of the continent -  the
representatives and the members of parliament in  other  African  countries.
This is not happening on a regular basis. I do not know how many of us  here
have regular interactions with our counterparts, even in the SADC  countries
around us.

We must know that it will be extremely important for us to be able not  only
just to interact on a social basis, but to be in a  position  where  we  can
build up relationships with our counterparts so that we can  also  be  in  a
position to influence them and be influenced by them, so that we  can  also,
as has been pointed out, see to it that the best  interests  of  our  people
will be served in this new Pan-African Parliament.

I therefore wish to make a proposal which I think we should really  consider
seriously, and that is that we should look at whether we should not make  it
possible for our members of Parliament to travel to African  countries  more
frequently, even if it is  just  countries  close  to  us,  SADC  countries,
because it will be  extremely  important  to  be  able  to  establish  those
relationships.

If we do not do that, it will not come about,  and  we  will  not  be  in  a
position to go into this new Pan-African Parliament, without  really  having
established those relationships which are so necessary. [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the term ``union'' brings  hope.  Declaration
means commitment. The meeting of parliamentarians from 38 member  states  of
the African Union brings hope of fulfilment of a vision.  The  inclusion  of
30% of women parliamentarians gives the African Union more strength and  the
wisdom it deserves to be a comprehensive structure.

It is the duty of each member of Parliament to make this  vision,  PAP,  the
Pan-African Parliament, come true.  On  behalf  of  my  party,  the  IFP,  I
commend the South African Parliament for the formula of three women  to  two
males, as against the formula that at least one woman of the five  delegates
to PAP should be a woman. There will be five delegates for each country  and
they must be true ambassadors of their country in all respects.

The oath of office is necessary for  such  an  undertaking  as  a  means  of
dedication and recommitment to the duty by delegates. As a  group  of  five,
they need a very strong support base to go on  with  their  work  with  less
tensions and stresses. Seminars on the Pan-African Parliament are  necessary
to inform  all  members  of  the  three  spheres  of  governance  about  the
knowledge they need regarding PAP.

The Pan-African Parliament is for the country. For a  full  support  of  our
delegates, all levels of Government must be taken on board. We  commend  the
23 countries that have signed the  protocol.  It  shows  commitment  to  the
establishment of the Pan-African Parliament and the readiness  to  face  the
challenges of the African continent together,  cross-culturally  and  across
colour lines. Just look at the case of a Nigerian woman who is facing  death
because of having given birth to a child out of wedlock. So many voices  are
pleading with the court of Nigeria for her pardon and freedom.

I commend the ANC Women's League for the stand they took to  sympathise  and
plead for Amina Lawal's mercy. [Applause.] Hold on! Hold  on,  daughters  of
Africa, this is great.  We  are  all  very  miserable  about  Amina  Lawal's
plight. We hope that the Almighty God will release her  from  the  miserable
situation she has to face. We are praying  for  her.  Twenty-five  September
2003 must bring good news to the whole of  the  African  continent  and  the
whole world, instead of death and misery which is expected as  a  result  of
her death sentence which is despicable.

Without the African Union we would not ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That concludes  the  debate.  I  shall
now put the question. The question is that the report  be  adopted.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are present in the  Chamber
to cast their provinces' votes. Are all delegation heads present?

In  accordance  with  rule  71,  I  shall  now  first  allow  provinces  the
opportunity to make their declarations of vote if they  so  wish.  We  shall
now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall  do  so  in  alphabetical
order per province. Delegation heads  must  please  indicate  to  the  Chair
whether they vote in favour, against or abstain  from  voting.  The  Eastern
Cape?

Ms B N DLULANE: Ke ya rona. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

Mr T S SETONA: The Free State votes in favour.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Gauteng?

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Gauteng supports.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: KwaZulu-Natal?

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: KwaZulu-Natal siyavumelana. [KwaZulu-Natal supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Limpopo?

Mr M I MAKOELA: Limpopo e a e amogela. [Limpopo supports.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mpumalanga?

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Ke ya rona. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Northern Cape?

Mrs N E LUBIDLA: Siyavuma. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?

Rev P MOATSHE: Ke ya rona. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Ons steun. [We support.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! All provinces have voted in favour.  I
therefore declare the report adopted. [Applause.]

  PROVINCIAL PERSPECTIVES ON LAND AND AGRICULTURAL MATTERS (EMANATING FROM
              PROVINCIAL OVERSIGHT VISITS FROM 17-20 JUNE 2003)

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chairperson, Minister and  colleagues,  we  want  to  say
thank you for this opportunity, and thank the Minister  for  being  part  of
this discussion. We know she has the interests of South Africa at  heart  on
the issues of agriculture and  land,  and  we  are  very  happy  that  she's
spearheading this important subject at the right time.  We  wish  her  every
success, and hope that we shall arrive at a stage, one  day,  when  all  the
people of this country have enough land and food.

[Section 41 (h) of the Constitution of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996  states
that all the sectors of Government should co-operate  with  one  another  in
mutual trust and good faith. They should inform one another of, and  consult
each other on matters of common interest. This comes from  the  Constitution
which also states that the NCOP should empower its permanent delegates  from
the nine provinces to go out and assess conditions  in  the  provinces,  the
main aim being to gather  information  from  the  different  departments  of
agriculture and land affairs, and local government, as  well  as  the  other
stakeholders who have an interest in issues of land.]

As gevolg van dekades van  grondonteiening  en  rassistiese  grondwette,  is
grondhervorming in Suid-Afrika van die mees ongebalanseerde in  die  wêreld,
met groot finansieel intensiewe plase  wat  groot  dele  van  die  landelike
gebiede domineer. Die resultaat hiervan is dat slegs 28% van Suid-Afrika  se
landelike bevolking op 88% van die grond woon. Dit wil sê,  die  oorblywende
12%  landbougrond  onderhou  72%  van  ons  landelike  bevolking,   en   die
voormalige  oorbevolkte  tuislande  skiet  ver   tekort   aan   die   nodige
infrastruktuur vir  landbou.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Owing to decades of land expropriation and racist  land  legislation,  land
reform in South is among the  most  unbalanced  in  the  world,  with  large
financially intensive farms dominating large parts of the rural  areas.  The
result of this is that only 28% of South Africa's rural population  live  on
88% of the land. This means to say, the remaining 12% of  agricultural  land
sustains 72% of our rural population, and the former  overcrowded  homelands
have  major  shortages  in  the  essential   infrastructure   required   for
agriculture.]

The  impact  of  past  discrepancies,  the  historical   context   of   land
dispossession and its impact on the majority  of  dispossessed  people  have
compelled the present Government to restore the dignity and rights  of  all.
The changes foreseen by the Government since 1994  within  the  agricultural
sector are part of a broader process of  rural  development  which  includes
land reform, investment in water supply and  transport  infrastructure,  and
improved social services delivery.

The three major goals for policy  reform  underpinned  in  the  agricultural
policy in South Africa encompass the following: to build  an  efficient  and
internationally competitive agricultural sector; to  support  the  emergence
of a more diverse structure of production  with  a  large  increase  in  the
number  of  successful  smallholder   farming   enterprises;   to   conserve
agricultural  natural  resources,  and  to  put  in   place   policies   and
institutions for sustainable resource use.

The Government identified agriculture as a key sector that required  special
attention because of its potential contribution to the objectives of  higher
economic growth. To  this  end  the  following  plans  and  programmes  were
initiated by the Government to achieve its objectives. With  regard  to  the
strategic plan for South African agriculture,  the  vision  for  the  sector
implies  sustained   profitable   participation   in   the   South   African
agricultural  economy  by  all  stakeholders.  It  recognises  the  need  to
maintain  and  increase  commercial  production   to   build   international
competitiveness and  to  address  the  historic  legacies  and  biases  that
resulted from skewed access and participation. [Interjections.]

With regard to food security at national level,  the  Government  made  this
one of the seven top national priorities in 1999.  All  provinces  developed
and  implemented  various  programmes  to  meet  their   circumstances   and
livelihoods. Linked to the issue of food security at national  level  is  an
initiative that practically addresses food security problems, both in  South
Africa and the rest of Africa. The Food and Agricultural Organisation,  FAO,
of the United Nations launched the tiller food campaign in 1997.

Land  Redistribution  for  Agricultural  Development,  LRAD,  which   is   a
subprogramme of the land distribution programme,  has  distinct  components,
and  these  encompass  the  transfer  of  agricultural  land   to   specific
individuals in group or commonage projects which aim to  improve  access  to
municipal and tribal land primarily for  grazing  purposes.  Regarding  land
care programmes, agriculture contributes simultaneously  to  household  food
security and economic growth. It also has the  potential  to  safeguard  the
quality of natural resources.

[The  Department  of  Agriculture  has,  through   its   land   preservation
programme, revived 800 hectares  of  land  suitable  for  agriculture  in  a
series of projects aimed at preserving land in the Eastern Cape,  Mpumalanga
and KwaZulu-Natal. About 1 786 jobs have been created.  In  the  North  West
province  25  land   preservation   programmes   aimed   at   reconstructing
agricultural land have brought about 10 000 hectares of land,  creating  640
vacancies in piece jobs. Small programmes  dealing  with  land  preservation
have been set up in different areas.]

The primary data collated in  respective  provinces  during  the  provincial
week visits from 17 to 20 June  2003  on  agricultural  issues  reflect,  in
summary, the following: The concerns of emerging  farmers  in  most  schemes
were being considered and addressed at various levels. Skills  training  and
development  for  project  members  were  ongoing  and   beneficiaries   are
beginning to utilise their skills. The financing of  projects  by  means  of
support grants and loan components from the Department  of  Agriculture  and
the Land Bank, respectively, was of crucial importance  to  members  of  the
projects.

While problems such as postdevelopment settlement assistance were  noted  by
the delegation, the oversight visit provided a forum in  which  to  open  up
debate and address key concerns of project members. It also noted  that  the
various institutions are aware of the  problems  and  different  levels  are
addressing these concerns.

In South Africa  the  land  question  is  strongly  linked  to  agricultural
development in the provinces. Qualitatively, settlements  are  characterised
by linking restitution and restoration with development. In  rural  areas  a
strong emphasis is placed on agricultural development ... [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call on  the  chairperson
of the standing committee on agriculture,  tourism  and  gambling  from  the
Western Cape, Mr Byneveldt.

Mnr S E BYNEVELDT (Wes-Kaap): Agb Voorsitter, Minister, baie dankie vir  dié
geleentheid, en baie dankie vir die  toeligting  wat  vandag  aan  besondere
kwessies  in  hierdie  Huis  en  in  hierdie  debat  gegee  is,  asook   die
geleentheid vir my deelname vandag.

Die provinsiale fokusweek was 'n baie welkome oefening  en  dit  was  beslis
ook 'n baie waardevolle oefening. In die Wes-Kaap, in die besonder, het  ons
dié oefening teen die bors gedruk en het ons ons insette  probeer  maak,  en
van daardie punte wil ek vandag uitlig  en  hier  herhaal.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr S E BYNEVELDT (Western Cape): Hon Chairperson, Minister, thank you  very
much for this opportunity, and thank you very much for shedding light  today
on  certain  matters  in  this  House  and  in  this  debate,  and  for  the
opportunity afforded me to participate today.

The  provincial  focus  week  was  a  very  welcome  exercise,  and  it  was
definitely  also  a  very  valuable  exercise.  In  the  Western  Cape,   in
particular, we embraced this exercise and we tried to  make  inputs,  and  I
would like to highlight and repeat some of those points here today.]

We have seen an increase of R500 million in the restitution  budget,  or  in
the national Budget with  regards  to  restitution.  In  the  Western  Cape,
however, there are limited rural restitution claims. The  redistribution  of
land in the province will therefore not benefit  much  from  this  increase.
The main land reform programme in the province is therefore  redistribution,
and the total national fund available  for  buying  land  for  land  reform,
redistribution and tenure reform was reduced by R10 million this year.

So, transfer of land to historically disadvantaged people in  the  province,
through whatever method, is going to be limited. Only R33 million  has  been
allocated to redistribution and tenure reform in a  province  where  current
projects on the books amount to R157 million. This  therefore  demands  that
we urgently look at the issue  of  additional  appropriation,  understanding
that there are limitations on redistribution, even in this financial year.

The second issue I want to highlight  relates  to  the  issue  of  municipal
commonage. Municipal commonage provides an extremely  important  opportunity
for land reform. It can be used, and must be used, in  order  for  the  very
poor to gain access to land for their own food security purposes. It can  be
used by emerging farmers who do not want to own land,  preferring  to  lease
land and put their resources directly into production, at whatever scale  of
production - men and women who may want a stepping stone to the  acquisition
of their own farm, again at whatever scale of production it may be used.

Commonage  land  is  municipal  land,  but  land  reform  and   agricultural
development are often not part of municipal  integrated  development  plans.
The result is that there is very little integration between  the  Department
of Land Affairs - DLA - and the programmes of the Department of  Agriculture
and municipalities.  Municipalities  are  able  to  obtain  additional  land
through the DLA commonage policy, but it is unclear how many  municipalities
are aware of this policy, how many have integrated either  current  land  or
future land in their IDPs, and how much of this  land  is  focused  on  poor
farmers.

Municipalities need to generate funds for all the services they supply,  and
commonage is a resource which can generate such funds.  At  the  same  time,
however, commonage land is a key  resource  with  which  municipalities  can
support the food security opportunities of the poor  and  the  broader  land
reform programme  of  the  country.  Municipalities  need  to  support  this
programme, and there needs to be a stronger link in terms of our  programmes
at a national level,  a  provincial  level,  and  then  also  the  role  and
responsibility of municipalities.

The third issue I want to highlight relates to the issue of tenure  security
for farm dwellers. While the Extension of Security of Tenure Act  is  a  law
which intends to regulate the eviction process, it does not  seem  to  deter
such evictions from taking place. Farmers who evict farm  dwellers  are  not
deterred by the punitive measures within this law. A stronger law  might  be
needed which will lengthen the  prison  terms  and  increase  the  fines  of
transgressions of the law. If we don't do this,  we  might  just  compromise
much of the achievement with regards to land reform and so forth.

The  final  issue  I  want  to  raise  relates  to  HIV/Aids,   reform   and
agricultural development. There appears to be little  understanding  of  the
impact of the HIV/Aids pandemic and how this  is  going  to  relate  to  the
issue of food and agricultural production. There are certain estimates  that
begin to suggest that about 15% to 35% of  adults  who  could  benefit  from
land reform are currently already HIV-positive, although virtually  none  of
them knows this. They will begin to fall ill from chronic illnesses.

The point is really that we must have a proper  sense  or  understanding  of
HIV/Aids and its impact with regard to people that we settle  on  the  land,
and whether, in fact,  this  will  begin  to  undermine  our  food  security
efforts, and also efforts with  regard  to  land  reform  and  settling  new
farmers. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, baie dankie.  Hierdie  verslag  wat  vandag
voor die Huis is, is heel waarskynlik een van die belangrikste  verslae  wat
ons nog ooit hier gedebatteer het, omdat dit die mense  op  grondvlak  direk
raak, as daar erns gemaak word met hierdie verslag, sal dit  bydra  tot  die
suksesvolle afhandeling van grondrestitusie, en ook  die  vestiging  van  'n
noemenswaardige  nuwe  groep  landbouers  in  Suid-Afrika.  As  dit  ernstig
opgeneem word, en die Minister en die provinsies neem dit  ook  ernstig  op,
bevestig dit die waarde en die plek van hierdie Raad, en bring dit  'n  nuwe
dinamika van parlementêre werk onder die aandag wat dié Raad waardig is.

Met dié verslag kom ons as Raad ons grondwetlike verantwoordelikheid  na  om
as Raad in goeder trou die nasionale Departement van Landbou  en  Grondsake,
maar ook ons provinsiale departemente, in te lig oor wat ons bevind het.  Ek
hoop hierdie verslag sal ook in die provinsies gedebatteer word, en dat  die
here van die provinsies nie net saam met ons hier debatteer nie.

As ons net dít doen, is dit  al  baie.  Die  nasionale  departement  en  die
provinsiale departemente het egter hierna 'n verantwoordelikheid om aan  dié
Raad terug te rapporteer oor die planne, om die  suksesse  wat  gerapporteer
is uit te bou, en om die planne rondom die mislukkings en probleemareas  aan
te spreek. Dit is 'n dimensie wat die verslag én ons rol  rêrig  sinvol  sal
maak.

Die  Suid-Afrikaanse  Regering  het  die  landbou   geïdentifiseer   as   'n
sleutelrolspeler wat spesiale aandag moet kry. Die Regering is  oortuig  van
die potensiaal wat die landbou het om by te dra tot die doelwit  van  groter
ekonomiese groei. Dit is  onmoontlik  om  in  besonderhede  dié  verslag  te
bespreek, maar ek wil tog net enkele aspekte beklemtoon.

Dit is belangrik dat Suid-Afrika moet weet dat die agb  Minister  Didiza  'n
klemverskuiwing in grondhervorming teweeggebring het. Haar hoofdoel  is  nie
om bloot mense op grond te plaas nie. Sy wil hê hulle moet  daarop  kan  bly
en dus volhoudbaar kan boer  en  daardeur  'n  bydra  lewer  om  armoede  te
verminder. Uit die verslag is dit ongelukkig  duidelik  dat  nuwe  boere  se
verwagtings  die  vermoë  van  die  departement,  om  juis  te  voldoen  aan
volhoudbaarheid, ver oorskry.

Dus egter nie net finansiële  vermoë  nie,  maar  ook  die  vermoë  om  nuwe
grondeienaars te bemagtig om  kommersiële  boere  te  wees  met  die  nodige
opleiding, voorligtingdiens en navorsing. Daar  is  verwagtinge  geskep  wat
kan ontaard as dit nie aangespreek word nie. Restitusie-eise  moet  vinniger
afgehandel word, en die verskonings wat in die verslag  na  vore  gekom  het
oor die gebrek aan  kapasiteit  van  sekere  kommissarisse  om  eise  af  te
handel,  is  onaanvaarbaar.  Die  afhandeling  van  dié  eise  is  veels  te
belangrik. Korrupsie en blote laksheid moet by  restitusie  uitgeroei  word.
Voorkeur en nóg geld moet vir restitusie bewillig word,  en  rolspelers  uit
die kommersiële sektor wat betrokke wil raak, moet eerder  aangemoedig  word
as wat hulle gefrustreer word deur agterdog en deur lang prosesse.

Dit is duidelik uit die verslag dat daar te min nuwe boere is wat  wesenlike
suksesverhale het, en dit moet aangespreek word. Die aanspreek is egter  nie
net die verantwoordelikheid van die agb Minister nie.  Die  nuwe  boere  het
nie net 'n reg om grond te besit nie; hulle het saam  met  dié  reg  ook  'n
verantwoordelikheid.

Die klimaat en gereedskap vir sukses moet egter geredelik  beskikbaar  wees,
en dít is die verantwoordelikheid van die Minister. Dit is ook duidelik  dat
die gevestigde kommersiële boere belangstel in mentorskappe,  maar  ons  sal
innoverend moet kyk na insentiewe aansporings dit ook volhoudbaar  te  maak.
Daar is reeds voorbeelde van suksesvolle  ``joint  ventures''  [gesamentlike
ondernemings], veral in die  Noord-Kaap  langs  die  Oranjerivier.  Daar  is
egter 'n klomp onkunde en 'n gebrek aan inligting by sekere  landbouers  oor
hoe om te werk te gaan om so 'n proses te begin, en ek  sal  dit  graag  met
die departement wil bespreek, want ons het juis 'n groot druiweboer  in  ons
gebied wat my  genader  het  oor  hoe  om  dit  te  doen.  [Tyd  verstreke.]
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Thank you, Chairperson. This report that is before  the
House today is most probably one of the most important reports that we  have
ever debated here,  because  it  affects  the  people  at  grassroots  level
directly, and if the report is taken seriously it  will  contribute  to  the
successful completion of land restitution, as well as the  establishment  of
a significant new group of farmers in South Africa. If taken seriously,  and
the Minister and the provinces also regard it as serious,  it  confirms  the
value and place of this Council and it  brings  to  the  attention  the  new
dynamics of parliamentary work that is worthy of this Council.

With this report we, as a Council, are doing  our  constitutional  duty  and
doing so in good  faith  as  a  Council,  by  informing  the  Department  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs, as well as our provincial  departments,  about
our findings. I hope this report will also be debated in the  provinces  and
that the gentlemen of the provinces will not only debate it here with us.

If we do only that, then we have already done much.  However,  the  national
department and the provincial departments have a responsibility after  this.
They have a duty to report back to this Council about plans to build on  the
successes that have  been  reported,  and  plans  to  address  failures  and
problem areas. It is a dimension that will give real meaning to  the  report
and our role.

The South African Government  has  identified  agriculture  as  a  key  role
player that requires special attention. The Government is convinced  of  the
potential of agriculture to contribute  to  the  goal  of  greater  economic
growth. It is impossible to discuss the report in  detail,  but  I  do  just
want to emphasise a few particular aspects.

It is important that South Africa should know that the hon  Minister  Didiza
has brought about a shift in focus with regard  to  land  reform.  Her  main
objective is not to only place people on land. She wants them to be able  to
live there and farm in a sustainable manner, and in doing so, contribute  to
alleviating  poverty.  It  is  evident  from  the  report,   however,   that
unfortunately the expectations of new farmers far exceed the  capability  of
the department, precisely to comply with sustainability.

It is not only financial capacity, but also the ability to empower new  land
owners to be commercial farmers with the necessary  training,  guidance  and
research. Expectations have been created that may get out of  hand  if  they
are not addressed. Restitution claims have to be settled  more  quickly  and
the excuses that emerged from the report  about  the  lack  of  capacity  of
certain commissioners to settle claims are unacceptable. The  settlement  of
these claims  is  much  too  important.  Corruption  and  simple  laxity  in
restitution have to be eradicated. Preference and  more  money  have  to  be
appropriated for restitution, and  the  role  players  from  the  commercial
sector who wish to become involved should be encouraged  rather  than  being
frustrated by suspicion and long processes.

It is evident from the report that there  are  too  few  farmers  that  have
substantial success stories, and this has to be  addressed.  Addressing  it,
however, is not the  responsibility  of  the  hon  Minister  only.  The  new
farmers not only have a right to own land. They also have a duty along  with
this right.

The climate and tools for success have to  be  readily  available,  however,
and  that  is  the  Minister's  responsibility.  It  is  also   clear   that
established farmers are interested in mentorships,  but  we  shall  have  to
take an innovative look at initiatives to make this sustainable.  There  are
already examples  of  successful  joint  ventures,  particularly  along  the
Orange River in the Northern Cape. However, there is great ignorance  and  a
lack of information among certain farmers about how  to  go  about  starting
off such a process, and I would like to discuss this  with  the  department,
because we do indeed  have  a  major  grape  farmer  in  our  area  who  has
approached me about how to do this. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I now call  upon  the  chairperson  of
the portfolio  committee  on  agriculture,  land  affairs,  environment  and
conservation from the Northern Cape, Mr Molusi.

Mr K D MOLUSI (Northern Cape): Thank you,  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister,  hon
members of the House, it is an honour for me  to  address  this  House  that
represents the voices of the masses. It is also with deep gratitude  that  I
would like to reflect on the critical matters that impact  on  the  domestic
economy of those living on the fringes of society.  Agriculture  is  at  the
heart  of  the  economic  advancement  of  those  that  never  enjoyed  land
ownership before the advent of our democratic society.

The noble intentions of the provincial visits emphasise  the  critical  role
of our permanent delegation. The June 2003  exercise  was  indeed  a  highly
fruitful one of accountability and  fact-finding.  With  the  Northern  Cape
being a vast agricultural province, ours is to make a thorough  analysis  of
the  sector's  teething  problems,  such  as   the   expensive   nature   of
agricultural ventures.

We are of the opinion that a land  summit  would  be  best  to  address  our
future actions in the areas of harnessing entrepreneurship, addressing  land
ownership and dealing with the overall plight of our countryside  masses.  A
shift in focus should, in the interim, allow the Northern Cape to enjoy  the
reclassification to that of a rural province in  calculating  the  equitable
share.

In my mind's eye lies the issue of postsettlement  support.  We  have  noted
the tailoring of a draft manual  on  pre-  and  postsettlement  support  for
restitution and land tenure reform cases.  This  process  needs  to  concern
itself with Government departments, such as Housing  and  Local  Government,
Agriculture and Land Reform,  Environmental  Affairs  and  Conservation  and
others,  realigning  their  budgets  to   meet   the   challenges   of   the
postsettlement support.
Skills development and material support should be  an  integral  element  of
postsettlement support. Support from the third sphere of Government is  also
critical. Municipalities should prioritise restitution processes by  linking
them to their integrated development programmes. More funds should  be  made
available to restitution. Conflict  resolution  is  a  much-needed  exercise
that will assist  in  addressing  incidents  that  have  marred  the  smooth
resettlement of communities.

The  Majeng  land  claim  can  be  cited  as  an  example  in  the  list  of
resettlement cases being affected  by  deep  divisions  sparked  by  illegal
occupations. Illegal actions must now give way to the  development.  In  the
main of these issues, the simplification of the  constitutions  of  communal
property associations should also be looked at  as  a  matter  of  priority.
Although a great deal of  work  had  been  undertaken  in  harnessing  black
economic  empowerment  within  agriculture,  our  oversight  visit  did  not
disregard  projects  that  are  experiencing  difficulties,  such   as   the
Sikhulule Chicken Enterprise project in Noupoort.
It is our view that the Department of Economic Affairs  should  revive  this
project, and the Department of Agriculture should  move  in  with  technical
support. Our new breed  of  entrepreneurs  within  the  agricultural  sector
should be granted unending support that will allow them to gain a  niche  in
foreign markets with quality projects. The breaking down of  trade  barriers
will benefit those that Government is advancing through  the  public-private
partnership initiatives, such as the Paprika project of Goodhouse.  We  will
have to offer our best products  to  stop  Europe  from  masquerading  trade
barriers as health  and  safety  standards.  It  is  for  this  reason  that
Government should protect the emergent sector  from  Europe  and  the  USA's
subsidised competition.

The Northern Cape is a province that has, in a  number  of  instances,  been
used as a career springboard  to  many  careerists.  Blows  have  also  been
delivered to our skills pool by corporate poachers. It is  for  this  reason
that we strongly recommend that the  Premier's  bursary  fund  beneficiaries
should be bound by contracts to remain in the employ of the  Northern  Cape.
We need to retain skills to enforce the implementation of more  changes.  It
is for ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, the NCOP in Kwazulu-Natal  had  formulated  a
programme for us to be briefed by the departments concerned, and also to  go
out for site visits to some of the projects in their respective  areas.  The
four sites which we visited were the Ezemvelo Gardens, Flower Farm,  Gongolo
Farms and Mpophomeni Gardens.

Ezemvelo is  a  community-driven  accredited  organic  agricultural  project
which grows indigenous food such as potatoes, madumbes, green  beans,  peas,
soya beans and sweet potatoes. The project is run  by  20  people  who  were
lucky to be funded by the Government with an amount of R500 000.  The  seeds
were given by the Department of Agriculture of Imbumbulu.

The project to help them water  their  gardens,  according  to  the  project
members, is taking too long to be completed. The income generated  from  the
produce is very little as many members are unemployed,  so  the  project  is
not sustainable at all. It needs some further  development.  On  the  second
day, we went to the Thuthukani Flower  project  in  Mooi  River.  It  has  a
greater chance of sustainability.

A lady farmer, Mrs McKenzie, has knowledge  of  how  to  do  her  work.  She
employs community members to assist her in her work.  She  also  trains  her
workers and has created an opportunity for her employees to become  part  of
the black empowerment programme, which we admired very much. They are  going
to produce their  own  products.  They  learn  and  practise.  This  project
pleased us very much during these visits. She approached the  Department  of
Agriculture for extra funds to develop this project. She is  still  waiting,
but the work still goes on tremendously.  The  Department  assisted  her  in
also training her employees in business skills. We admire this very much.

Difficulties arise when she cannot cope with the overseas market needs.  Her
project is so prosperous that she can pack  and  send  her  bulbs  overseas.
It's a huge task.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  on  a  point  of  order,  I  detect  some
provincial bias here. I don't know as to whether you  have  any  connections
with the hon member's province, but when the hon member  from  the  Northern
Cape spoke, you cut him very short. You are not doing the same now.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I don't  know  what  you  mean,
when you say I cut him very short. Hon member Van Niekerk,  I  did  not  cut
him short.

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Thank you very much, Chairperson. Now I don't  know  where
I was. Mrs McKenzie has approached the Department of Agriculture and she  is
still waiting for  funds,  especially  since  difficulties  arise  when  she
cannot cope with overseas market needs,  because  of  a  lack  of  funds  to
kickstart the project. Employees do not have a place  of  their  own  to  do
their work and she has allowed them to use her shed. This was very  good  of
her and we admire it very much.

Then we had another visit to the permaculture project  at  Mpophomeni.  This
project started in 1998 with 25 members, but now only six members are  still
working. Due to unemployment there are few  chances  of  sustainability.  In
this area, the Government has donated R45 000  worth  of  pipes  and  pumps,
which are not completely installed. The community is not  pleased  with  the
system  installed.  They  prefer  to  use  the  ordinary  hosepipes.   [Time

(Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows.)

[Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Thank you,  Chairperson,  I  am  so  grateful  for  this
opportunity to be part of this debate. I greet all  the  hon  members.  This
has been a very long day, Chairperson. When I listened to the speech of  our
chairperson, Rev Moatshe, eloquently putting it in  Setswana  and  switching
to Afrikaans, I was so amazed that I began to wonder what  I  was  going  to
say, because he said most of the things that I had prepared  in  my  speech.
Nevertheless, people like Chief Mokoena put it  correctly  in  English  when
they say: `Great minds think alike.'

However, I would like to state that, as I am speaking on behalf of the  ANC,
we are grateful to the  leaders  of  that  department  which  is  headed  by
Minister Didiza, for their successful fight against poverty.  When  we  went
out in our different groupings our slogan was:  `We  are  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty!']

It comes as no surprise that in this debate, important as it may be, the  DA
is not participating. By implication it says that they  are  not  interested
in pushing back the frontiers of poverty. In the spirit  of  their  campaign
of fighting back, they are  well  aware  that  they  can't  fight  back  the
political  wheel  of  the  ANC-led  Government  with  the  social  contract,
together with the people of South Africa, to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty.

It is through this glorious programme of land restitution that  we  see  the
dignity and respect of people being brought back,  especially  since  people
are brought back to the land from which they  were  forcefully  removed  and
dispossessed by the regime which didn't care for them.

Kuyajabulisa  kakhulu  kubona  tinhlelo   letifana   naloluhlelo   lolubitwa

(Translation of Siswati paragraphs follows).

[It's a great pleasure to see programmes such as Elrad,  which  involve  the
distribution of land  for  the  purposes  of  farming  development.  We  saw
thousands and thousands of South African communities  taking  part  in  this
programme. As I speak, I am proud of the women and the youth who are  taking
part in these programmes where they plant vast fields  of  sugar  cane;  and
they even have some garden plots in Nkomazi and  in  many  other  places  in
Mpumalanga. In that way they can bring food to their homes before sunset.

There are other programmes that we discovered as we  combed  the  Mpumalanga
province. We realised that there are programmes that are of  great  help.  I
will briefly mention some of them, like  the  project  at  Ermelo  where  we
found women working on the  Chubekani  Wesselton  Garden.  When  we  arrived
there my heart was overwhelmed with joy. In  Xitsonga  they  say:  Mpilu  ya
mina ya tsaka. (My heart leaps with joy.) [Laughter.]

We could not go without noticing those very strong women  working  on  their
farms, not only to bring in food to their pots, but also to  sell.  In  that
way they even get a  profitable  income  which  helps  them  pay  for  their
children's education, uniforms, and to build their own homes. This  made  us
realise that these programmes  do  contribute  to  the  development  of  our
economy.

Our trip did not end there. When we crossed over to Malekutu, we  discovered
a very beautiful Land  Care  Project.  That  is  where  the  Departments  of
Agriculture and Land Affairs in the Mpumalanga province support farmers  who
found themselves in a great predicament after the floods which eroded  their
farm soil. We also saw some very constructive programmes which they  use  to
refertilise their soil so that farming could be possible.

I would be making a great mistake if I did not mention the project  that  we
found at Carolina valley, where we  saw  the  youth  planting  strawberries.
When we talked to them, we discovered that they had even gone to the  extent
of getting a contract with Woolworths where they send their produce.

The youth I am talking about is the youth with whom we were  teargassed  and
at whom rubber bullets were fired during the struggle. It is the  youth  who
had no way of acquiring skills, but now we see them having  so  many  skills
in farming. Mr Tolo would also attest to that, since he was with us  and  he
saw these projects.

Let me point out that it was a great pleasure for us to witness  the  people
of Botshabelo, in Middelburg,  getting  their  land  back.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]]

The MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you  very  much,
Chairperson. Hon members, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the  members
who have participated in this debate, because indeed they amplified what  we
have read on paper and also what we know, and because our role is  not  just
to transfer projects, but also to follow up  and  see  whether  or  not  our
efforts have an important impact. I also want to thank members who  may  not
have participated in the debate, but who have been part of the  visits,  for
their work.

What these visits reflect, for me and I am sure  for  all  of  us,  is  that
through the role that we have as members of Parliament  and  as  members  of
the executive, we are able to see the impact of our  policies,  as  well  as
the  legislation  that  we  pass,  together  with  the   budgets   that   we
appropriate, on those whom we represent.

All members who have spoken, and I am sure also those who have  not  spoken,
have realised from first-hand experience how difficult it is to build  anew,
as well as to transform our society from the legacy of our  past  to  a  new
society that seeks to deal with concerns, not  only  of  a  section  of  our
society, but all members of our country  -  appreciating,  of  course,  that
some  emphasis  will  have  to  be  given  to  those  who  were   previously
disadvantaged. The report also highlights the need for the strengthening  of
our government system, and ensures that  the  integrated  approach  that  we
have chosen does take root in all our provinces.

I raise this issue in this way, because clearly in a number of provinces  we
have seen better integration between the national sphere of  Government  and
the province, as  well  as  local  government.  We  have  also  seen  better
collaboration among the different departments.  We  have  also  seen  better
communication with the communities. We do, however, appreciate  that  it  is
not the same everywhere, and this is the challenge of our new  democracy  we
have to deal with.

Certainly it also highlights the need for capacity building among those  who
are recipients of our  programmes,  as  well  as  the  need  for  continuous
Government support in this regard. The report states, and  I  am  sure  that
members would have  seen  for  themselves,  that  in  most  instances  those
projects that have succeeded are those  where  there  is  strong  leadership
among the community members and where the structures that are  managing  the
land  on  behalf  of  the  community   themselves   are   aware   of   their
responsibilities and can execute it as such. It is also  in  instances  when
the members of the general  communities  themselves  understand  what  their
roles are  in  relation  to  those  whom  they  have  elected  to  be  their
representatives in such committees. It is also in instances where  there  is
accessibility to the offices of Government so that  when  these  communities
need help, they know exactly where to go.

It also highlights the work that some of  our  members  of  Parliament  have
done in their constituency offices to keep a bridge between  our  community,
Parliament and Government. However, it also shows  that  if  some  of  these
communities, for instance, have chosen agriculture as an enterprise,  it  is
not only leadership, which may be natural,  of  course,  or  even  acquired,
that is required. What is sometimes needed is  further  training  that  will
help them to understand the enterprise  they  have  gone  in.  And  this  is
where, in my view, I think our essential service at provincial level  is  an
element that still needs to be improved. I think in this regard  the  report
might help us to really examine whether or not the nature of our  Government
structure in terms of concurrent function is really as ideal  as  we  think,
because, as you see in  the  report,  there  is  somehow  a  disjuncture  at
certain levels.

The provincial legislatures and the provincial  departments  of  agriculture
have some executive functions as well as legislative functions,  where  they
can take particular decisions with the budgets that have  been  so  devolved
into those  provinces.  As  we  know,  once  provincial  budgets  have  been
sourced, there is very little the national Government can do  to  interfere.
However, we can persuade, cajole and use  the  co-ordinating  structures  of
the Minmecs, as well as visits at a bilateral level to point out where  some
of the difficulties are.

Sometimes, however, even in  the  budget  process,  some  of  the  important
elements,  as  I  have  said  earlier,  such  as  extension   services   and
infrastructure development, are in one way or the  other  forgotten.  It  is
for this reason that, as the national Department for  Agriculture,  we  feel
there is a need for an accord between ourselves and the provinces  which  we
can sign, regarding those issues that are critical  for  the  sustenance  of
agriculture so that we can at least commit on a common mandate.

Also, the visit has highlighted, in my view,  the  need  for  asserting  the
campaign of Batho Pele among our public servants so that the  way  in  which
our public servants respond to the needs of the  community  is  quicker  and
more compassionate. As members were listening to communities, I am sure  one
of the things you heard was how slow the processes sometimes  are,  as  some
of the bureaucracies go ``Môre is nog 'n dag'' [Tomorrow is  another  day.].
There is no conscience regarding the need for speed,  and  I  think  we  all
have a duty  to  make  sure  that  the  group  of  people  we  have  in  our
Government's Public Service, both the old  and  the  new,  are  continuously
made conscious of their responsibility to our citizens.

The other issue of importance that I think  the  report  highlights  is  the
need for continuous dialogue between ourselves, as the  various  spheres  of
Government, and our communities. One of the things, for  instance,  I  noted
in the report, without  going  into  detail,  was  that  there  are  certain
inaccuracies which you can tell are not out of malice,  but  because  people
do not have enough information.

A case in point is a matter that was referred to around Mpumalanga.  If  you
read the report, you  may  actually  think  the  office  of  restitution  of
Mpumalanga and Limpopo is still a combined  office  and  the  recommendation
from the committee actually says we must make sure that  those  offices  are
divided. However, members  will  remember  -  uphi  uchief?  [Where  is  the
chief?] He is here - when I informed this House about that decision that  we
took three years ago. We  appointed  two  commissioners  and,  as  we  speak
today, the increase of resolution of claims in both  the  provinces  affirms
the decision we had so made.

Hon members will recall that  in  the  2000-01  financial  year  only  three
claims were settled in Mpumalanga. To date there are about 542  claims  that
have been settled. In Limpopo there were only  two  claims  in  1999.  Today
there are about 1 100 claims that have been settled. [Applause.]

Overall, in the country, 40 323 claims have been settled to date. Again,  if
you look at the statistics that have been put in the report on the  transfer
of land in Mpumalanga,  they  give  an  inaccurate  picture.  About  233 000
hectares of land have been transferred to about 47 554 beneficiaries.

Without these inaccuracies, I think it is  important  to  say  that,  having
read your report, we as the department  and  the  commission  have  taken  a
decision that we will study it and take into consideration in  our  planning
and budget cycle the recommendations that you have made. Also, they help  us
as a national department to make sure that we can work  with  our  provinces
to assist in the areas where such assistance may be required.

I wish to share with hon members that there are certain  challenges,  in  my
view, that we need to deal with continually. You would recall that  we  took
a  deliberate  decision  two  years  ago  that  we  had  to   transfer   all
agricultural state land that was part of the SADT land, where  such  schemes
as Ncora, Qamata, Makhathini and others were constructed,  to  the  relevant
beneficiaries.

The challenge is that with some of those schemes, communities  were  removed
and other people were brought in to work on the  schemes.  If  you  were  to
look at this very clinically and say that the beneficiaries of the land  are
the ones who get the schemes and the rest must go away, you would be  likely
to create some form of instability. Therefore you need  a  creative  way  to
try to have a balance between the land rights of those whose land was  taken
away from them in favour of the scheme,  and  the  underlying  rights  those
people who have worked on the scheme have acquired in  the  years  in  which
they have been there.

I think that that balancing effect does take time. Therefore you  find  that
in some schemes such as Qamata, Ncora and even Makhathini,  the  land  still
belongs to the state while  we  sort  out  the  underlying  rights  problems
inherent in those areas.

This does not absolve us, of course,  of  the  responsibility  of  assisting
those who are working on those schemes. At the same time, though, I  thought
it was necessary for us to share this with you so that you  understand  what
the problems sometimes are. For instance,  regarding  the  Tshefu  pineapple
scheme in Peddie, we assisted that scheme, acknowledging,  of  course,  that
there were land tenure rights that needed to be resolved. We  offered  those
communities, in the interim, a lease option so that they could get  on  with
the work.

We wrote off the debt of R10 million. They say to you that they  don't  know
what happened to that R10 million. We explained what  that  R10 million  was
for. Some of the farmers who were funded before by the state were  owing  an
amount of R10 million. Therefore, in order to assist them to  go  back  into
production, in partnership with some of the commercial farmers in the  area,
we had to find a mechanism - working with the province - in terms  of  which
we could write off that debt of R10 million and  recapitalise  the  project,
while, at the same time, they would be paying back Government  some  of  the
money they owe.

The time of the lease is going to expire, and we have been  discussing  with
the farmers their getting another long-term  lease  or  an  option  to  buy.
These are the matters we are discussing, but I think the way in  which  they
have been articulated does not give that real perspective.

Round the area of the Magwa tea  estate,  there  is,  again,  another  issue
which my predecessor, Minister Hanekom, tried  to  deal  with.  One  of  the
issues we had to deal with in the Magwa tea estate was to  find  a  way,  on
the one hand, to accommodate the traditional leadership and their  interests
in that area, particularly iNkosi yamaMpondo [the Chief of amaMpondo],  and,
on the other hand, to take into consideration the needs of  the  workers  on
the scheme  and  those  community  members  who  come  from  areas  such  as
Cofimvaba to work in the Magwa tea estate.

So, we tried to find a 50-50 situation to accommodate all  these  interests.
We gave the resources to assist and revitalise the scheme. However, I  think
there is one issue we all have to appreciate, and  you  would  realise  that
this is a similar issue in the majority  of  share  equity  schemes.  It  is
sometimes very difficult for people who have been workers for  a  long  time
to understand the change or the transition from being  a  worker  solely  to
becoming a worker and an owner, or a worker and a shareholder.

I remember that at some stage we had to intervene in Magwa  when  they  were
toyi-toying about the wages. We raised the question as  to  whom  they  were
toyi-toying for, because they were the owners of  the  entity.  So,  if  the
entity was not making money, it meant that they should  do  something  about
making money. [Laughter.] These are the challenges  which  all  of  us  here
have a responsibility to articulate.

I do not want us to find ourselves going for  a  one-size-fits-all  approach
in which you either lease land or buy  land  outright  for  people,  without
looking for a mechanism which allows for  joint  partnership  with  existing
farmers and their workers. I think this is an important element,  but  there
needs to be support, growth and understanding of what these  roles  mean  as
they change. We are actually engaged in trying to find a resolution to  that
issue.

In Magwa you have the workers  and  the  community  all  being  members  and
shareholders. They do not have the technical capacity  of  making  tea.  The
resources that the adviser required, a  specialist  in  tea,  could  not  be
afforded by the new owners. Therefore that created other problems.

The other issue, a complex one that I need  to  discuss  with  you,  is  the
issue around hemp cultivation. We reported, again in  this  House,  that  we
worked together with Mercedes-Benz, the Agricultural Research  Council,  the
MRC and the Department of Trade  and  Industry,  more  particularly  at  the
provincial level in the Eastern Cape, to try to look at diversification  and
other, alternative crops. Hemp was one such product which Mercedes-Benz  was
willing to finance, because they wanted to build dashboards  using  material
out of hemp. However, as you all know, hemp is part of the cannabis family.

I-hemp iyingxenye nje yensangu, kodwa iyile nsangu  engadaki,  oyibhema  nje
ikushiye unguwe. [Hemp is another form of dagga,  but  it  is  the  kind  of
dagga that does not intoxicate you. You can smoke it and remain sober.]

What happened is that the Department of  Health,  which  is  the  entity  to
certify and remove hemp from the schedule for cannabis, asked  for  planting
varieties to be tested in various areas in the Eastern  Cape  where  it  was
clear the soil type was susceptible to such a commodity.

The first trial showed good progress and,  the  second  one,  again,  showed
improvements. The other varieties that we started planting also showed  some
positive and interesting results. Unfortunately, Qamata, in  terms  of  what
the  managers  of  the  scheme  needed  to  do,  could  not  meet  all   the
requirements of the planting of hemp as this was a  pilot  project.  So,  at
this stage, there is no drive for the massive production of hemp, unless  we
finish those trials and unless the national Department of Health removes  it
from the cannabis schedule of drugs. It  is  only  then  that  we  can  move
forward.

So, when members say small farmers are not allowed to  plant  hemp,  indeed,
it is not true. I am raising these things, because  they  reflect  the  need
for us as Government, the members of Parliament,  to  have  a  very  dynamic
relationship with our communities so that they are able  to  understand  the
processes and are able to be better informed about the choices they make.

Tomorrow is Heritage Day. I therefore do not want to take a long  time.  One
last issue I need to raise  is  the  one  raised  by  ...  um,  Mr  ...  the
representative from the Western Cape - before I  make  a  mistake  with  his
name.

I think the issue of commonages, as it is raised in the report, is not  only
a critical entry point for farming, but  also  for  security,  as  you  have
mentioned. What is important for us, I think,  is  to  appreciate  that  the
beneficiaries,  who  may  have  been  the  first  to  apply  for   commonage
assistance from Government, will not be the same people if you go from  here
to there.

When  we  transfer  the  land  of  commonages,  it  is  transferred  to  the
municipalities. Beneficiaries themselves cannot claim the right to say  that
because  they  were  the  initiators,  they  would  therefore  be  there  in
perpetuity. It is a facility which, when we embarked on the  programme  with
the municipalities, they were to use for food security  purposes  for  their
local communities, particularly for those who lived below the poverty line.

What has sometimes happened is that some of the municipalities,  after  such
land was transferred, have sought to sell it or have sought to lease  it  to
richer people who can pay  them.  We  have  intervened  at  various  levels,
because that was not the agreed intention. These  were  resources  given  by
the national Government to the local government to assist  their  vulnerable
communities.

The issue of HIV and Aids, as you said, is a matter which, in  my  view,  we
need to make a better study of to understand what the impact will be in  the
agricultural sector, not only in production, but also in  the  value  chain.
This is so that we are able to make a proper determination of how we  manage
the disease within the agricultural sector as a whole.

Mama  uVilakazi,  ngendaba  kamama   uMackenzie   nesivumelwano   somnyango,

[Mrs Vilakazi, regarding the issue of Mrs Mackenzie and the  agreement  with
the department, I must say that we will follow it up, because I do not  know
what kind of agreement they made. We will follow it up so that we  can  find
out where the problem is.

I would like to thank all members of Parliament for the work that they  have
done, which has shortened the distance that my colleagues and I would  still
have to go. Today we will be able to follow in your footsteps and come  back
to this Parliament to explain what is going to be done  about  the  problems
that you have seen, and where we are going. Have a nice day tomorrow.  Thank
you. [Applause.] ]

Debate concluded.

The Council adjourned at 17:38.
