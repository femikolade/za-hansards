TUESDAY, 25 MARCH 2003
                                    ____

                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The House met at 14:02.

The Speaker took the Chair and requested members  to  observe  a  moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

The SPEAKER: Order, hon  members!  I  have  to  announce  changes  in  party
membership that have occurred in terms of Schedule 6A to the Constitution.

Mr D G Mkono has left the United Democratic Movement and joined the  African
National Congress on 24 March 2003. [Applause.]

The following members have left the the New National Party  and  joined  the
Democratic Alliance: Mrs S M Camerer, Mr J W le Roux, Mr C M Morkel, Mr A  H
Nel, Mr I J Pretorius, Dr P J Rabie, Mr  C  R  Redcliffe  and  Mr  F  J  van
Deventer on 24 March, and Mr W P Doman on 25 March 2003. [Applause.]
Ms T E Millin has left the Inkatha  Freedom  Party  on  25  March  2003  and
formed   a   new   party,   namely   the   African   Independent   Movement.
[Interjections.]

Mr C Aucamp has left the Afrikaner-Eenheidsbeweging on 25  March  2003,  and
has become a member of a party called National Action. [Interjections.]

The Assembly will only adapt its operations and functioning at the close  of
the window period. In the interim, receiving parties  must  make  their  own
arrangements to accommodate new members. Any specific concerns that  parties
may have or problems they may encounter should be raised with me.

We shall now proceed with notices of motion. Does any member  wish  to  give
notice of a motion?

Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

The SPEAKER: Yes?

Dr C P MULDER: I would like to enquire whether it is in order, in  terms  of
the Rules of the House, that members of the DA, under the leadership of  Mrs
Camerer, are seated amongst the members of the DP, under the  leadership  of
Mr Tony Leon. Normally we have separate seating arrangements  for  different
parties. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! As I indicated, at the end of the window period we  will
be looking at the seating arrangements. Until then,  whoever  the  receiving
parties are, or wherever people can find hospitality, they should  seek  and
find it. [Applause.]

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move -
-


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the hon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has failed to present  herself
           for the purpose of being disciplined by the Speaker; and
       (b)  the decision of  the  House  to  reprimand  and  discipline  the
           honourable member was  taken  last  year  and  that  she  is  in
           contempt of the House; and


  (2) resolves that the hon Madikizela-Mandela be  given  one  further  day
       within which to attend Parliament, failing which her party should  be
       requested to remove her as an MP.

Mr J SCHIPPERS: Madam Speaker, I give notice that I shall move:


  That the House discuss the necessity of introducing  the  death  penalty.
  Thank you. [Interjections.]

                     SUCCESSFUL HOSTING BY SOUTH AFRICA
                          OF ICC CRICKET WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  South Africa has successfully  hosted  the  Cricket  World  Cup,

  (2) believes that this international event hosted by South  Africa,  with
       certain games played in Zimbabwe and Kenya, attracted  the  attention
       of millions of viewers  across  the  world,  further  confirming  the
       status of South Africa as a safe and trusted venue for  future  world
       events;


  (3) congratulates -

           successful Cricket World Cup.

Agreed to.

                             MEMBERS' STATEMENTS

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Only members of the parties I  will  call  out  will  be
allowed to make statements.

                       TUBERCULOSIS AWARENESS CAMPAIGN

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms P TSHWETE (ANC): Madam Speaker,  despite  tuberculosis  being  a  curable
disease, over 5 000 people are killed by it each day. South Africa  has  the
seventh highest infection rate in the world with 243 306 infections.  It  is
due to this sharp increase in TB infections that our  Department  of  Health
joined forces with the World Health Organisation, NGOs and  CBOs  to  launch
the ``Dots cured me, it will cure you  too''  awareness  campaign  on  World
Tuberculosis Day, yesterday, 24 March 2003.

Through this campaign, we are especially encouraging  those  suffering  from
TB, firstly, to attend primary health care clinics that this Government  has
established in most  communities  around  the  country;  and,  secondly,  to
finish their treatment. It  is  especially  developing  countries  including
ours  that  are  hard  hit  by  poverty,  malnutrition,   poor   sanitation,
overcrowding and a high incidence of HIV/Aids that contribute to the  spread
of TB. Hence,  as  the  ANC,  we  advocate  a  comprehensive  approach  that
strengthens our poverty alleviation programmes as part of the  treatment  of
TB and related diseases.

We call on members of Parliament  and  the  public  at  large  to  encourage
people to observe their treatment, because TB is curable. [Applause.]

                         BY-ELECTION VICTORY FOR DA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J SELFE (DA): Madam Speaker, the five by-elections contested  by  the  DA
last week were a defining test of opposition support in the  run-up  to  the
2004 elections.

The DA won all five by-elections. [Applause.] The New NP contested only  the
Swellendam by-election. The New NP came a dismal third in this  by-election,
proving that it has been destroyed as an electoral force  in  South  Africa,
because it left the DA and entered into an alliance with the ANC.

In the by-election in Pretoria, the DA soundly  beat  the  FF  and  the  CP,
proving that the DA is overwhelmingly the  party  of  choice  of  Afrikaans-
speaking South Africans. [Interjections.]

The DA made good progress against the ANC, both in Phalaborwa  and  Vryheid,
where the ANC polled only 8  votes,  compared  with  the  703  for  the  DA.
[Interjections.] It is clear that the voters  support  the  DA's  principled
opposition to the ANC. They reject the New NP's co-option by  the  ANC,  and
the narrow option of the far right. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

                     MINERAL AND PETROLEUM ROYALTY BILL

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E J LUCAS  (IFP):  Madam  Speaker,  Parliament  passed  the  Mineral  and
Petroleum Resources Development Bill in June 2002, and the President  signed
it on 3 October 2002. The Act, which will fundamentally  change  the  mining
landscape in South Africa, could, however, not  be  implemented  immediately
owing to the requirement that a money Bill had to first  be  passed  by  the
legislature.

After a considerable delay, the Minister of Finance  made  the  Mineral  and
Petroleum Royalty Bill public  on  20  March  2003.  In  essence,  the  Bill
introduces a royalty regime for mining that imposes a  quarterly  charge  on
holders of mineral rights for the extraction and transfer of  South  African
mineral resources. The  Minister  also  announced  that  approximately  four
weeks would be allowed for public comment on the draft money Bill.

Although we feel  that  more  time  should  be  made  available  for  public
comment, the IFP wants to urge  all  relevant  stakeholders  to  engage  the
national Treasury with immediate effect so that their  comments  and  inputs
are taken into account in the final version of the Bill that will be  tabled
in Parliament.

In doing so, we also want to remind stakeholders that  Parliament  does  not
have the power to amend a money Bill once it has been tabled. We can  either
accept or reject it, but we can make no  changes  to  it.  It  is  therefore
vital that inputs be made at  the  earliest  possible  time  and  definitely
before tabling. Thank you.

                    CAPE METRO LISTENING CAMPAIGN SUCCESS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D A A OLIFANT (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC is taking bold steps  towards
giving life to the principle of a people-centred government,  which  is  the
foundation of our democracy. Let me quote few examples.  On  1  April  2003,
the Cape Town Metropolitan Council will be  hosting  the  last  leg  of  the
listening campaign, which started  on  March  5  with  the  mayor  and  Exco
visiting different areas in Cape Town.  The  overwhelming  response  towards
this campaign shows that the general public of Cape  Town  is  beginning  to
feel part of their municipality because, for the first time,  they  have  an
opportunity directly to interact with the City Council on issues of  service
delivery.

The  Eastern  Cape  government  is  planning  an  Exco  outreach  programme,
starting from March 31 and running until April 4, in  which  the  Government
will be talking to the people  of  the  Lusikisiki  district  and  answering
questions on issues of delivery.

Similar programmes are happening in Gauteng through the Government's  roving
executive programme, and in the Northern Cape this has been going on  for  a
few years with huge  success.  These  listening-to-the-people  sessions  are
aimed mainly at the people in order for them to have a  direct  say  in  the
running of the Government and their country. I thank you. [Applause.]

                   NEW NP ONCE AGAIN DOES THE RIGHT THING

                            (Member's Statement)
Dr B L GELDENHUYS (Nuwe NP):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  die  Nuwe  NP-lede  wat
oorgeloop het na die DP is 'n tydelike terugslag vir die Nuwe  NP,  maar  as
die agb leier van die DP dink dit is 'n nekslag, maak hy  die  fout  van  sy
lewe. Dit sal nie die eerste keer wees dat die Nuwe NP 'n prys betaal  omdat
hy die regte ding doen nie.

Toe die ou NP in 1992 besluit het om 'n beleid van  magsdeling  te  aanvaar,
het die party geskeur, maar dit was die regte ding om te doen.  Toe  die  ou
NP in 1990 besluit het om 'n ooreenkoms met die ANC aan te  gaan  oor  Suid-
Afrika se toekoms, het baie kiesers in 1999 die rug op die  Nuwe  NP  gekeer
omdat hy dan kwansuis die mense by Kodesa sou uitverkoop het, maar  dit  was
die regte ding om te doen. Toe die Nuwe NP nou weer besluit het om saam  met
die ANC te werk, in belang van die mense wat hy verteenwoordig en in  belang
van politieke versoening, het 'n paar van sy LPs oorgeloop na  die  DP  toe,
maar weer was dit die regte ding om te doen. [Applous.]

Die Nuwe NP sal  aanhou  om  die  boodskap  van  samewerkende  regering  met
entoesiasme uit te dra, want dit is die regte ding om  te  doen.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)
[Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP members  who  crossed
over to the DP have caused a temporary setback for the NP, but  if  the  hon
leader of the DP thinks that this is a knock-out  blow,  he  is  making  the
mistake of his life. It would not be the first time that the New NP  has  to
pay a price for doing the right thing.

When the old NP decided to adopt a  policy  of  power-sharing  in  1992  the
party was split, but it was the right thing to do. When the old  NP  decided
to enter into an agreement on the future of South Africa  with  the  ANC  in
1990, a lot of voters turned their backs on the  New  NP  in  1999,  because
they had supposedly sold out the people at Codesa,  but  it  was  the  right
thing to do. When the New NP recently again decided to co-operate  with  the
ANC in the interests of the people it represented and in  the  interests  of
political reconciliation, a few of its MPs crossed over to the DP, but  once
more it was the right thing to do.

The New NP will continue to advocate with  enthusiasm  the  message  of  co-
operative governance, because it is the right thing to do. [Applause.]]

                         REMUNERATION OF VOLUNTEERS
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J T MASEKA (UDM): Madam Speaker, hon members, volunteers  are  playing  a
vital role in rendering important services in  some  government  departments
that  are  heavily  understaffed.  Some  of  these  volunteers   have   been
volunteering for a long period of time - up to  four  years  -  without  any
form of remuneration  whatsoever.  These  volunteers  have  to  travel  long
distances to and from places  where  they  render  services  with  transport
money provided by families or relatives. They are expected to be  clean  and
presentable at all times, even though they are not remunerated.

When posts occur in these departments  they  are  not  even  considered  for
employment, even if  they  have  the  necessary  experience  for  the  post.
However, a person who has no working experience is employed just because  he
or she has academic qualifications or  is  known  by  someone  in  a  senior
position in that department. I suggest that this issue of  remuneration  and
possible employment of these valuable volunteers be seriously considered  by
all departments that are benefiting from the services of  these  volunteers.
I thank you.

                      COUP IN CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU (ANC): Madam Speaker, on 1 March 2003 a coup  d'état  took
place in the Central African Republic. This coup  d'état  was  organised  by
the reactionary rebel forces of Francois Bozize, who immediately  after  the
coup declared himself the head of state of that country.

Bozize is the Central Republic's former chief of  staff  who  organised  two
unsuccessful coups between 2001 and 2002  to  overthrow  the  democratically
elected government of President Ange-Felix Patasse.

In keeping with the decisions and declarations adopted by  the  Algiers  and
Lomé Summits and the provisions of  the  Constitutive  Act  of  the  African
Union, we  wish  to  unequivocally  reject,  condemn  and  denounce  in  the
strongest possible terms  the  unconstitutional  means  by  which  a  regime
change took place in that country.

As South Africa plays a leading role in dealing with global issues  such  as
good governance, human rights, democracy, peacekeeping and  peace  building,
we wish to applaud the Department of Foreign Affairs for  adding  its  voice
to the worldwide condemnation of the unconstitutional transfer of  power  in
the Central African Republic. I thank you. [Applause.]

                        FF OPPOSED TO FLOOR-CROSSING

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (VF): Mevrou die Speaker, die VF het  hom  in  hierdie  Raad
teen die oorloopwetgewing uitgespreek en het ook daarteen gestem. Die  vraag
is waarom. Omdat ons glo dat dit ondemokratiese wetgewing is en die  kiesers
se wense ignoreer.

Ons glo selfs dat dit gevaarlik kan wees  en  onstabiliteit  in  Suid-Afrika
kan  bring.  Jy   kan   ten   gunste   van   oorloop   argumenteer   in   'n
kiesafdelingstelsel, waar die keisers  vir  'n  spesifieke  kandidaat  stem,
soos voor 1994. Jy  kan  nie  ten  gunste  van  oorloop  argumenteer  in  'n
proporsionele stelsel nie, waar die kiesers vir 'n betrokke politieke  party
stem. Die persentasie steun wat die politieke party by die kiesers  kry,  is
ook in 'n presiese verhouding  van  die  hoeveelheid  verkose  lede  wat  in
hierdie Parlement of ander wetgewers sal sit. Die oorloop van lede  verander
hierdie verhouding.

In KwaZulu-Natal, byvoorbeeld, het die kiesers gestem dat die  ANC  nie  die
provinsie regeer nie, maar wel die IVP. Oorloop maak  dit  nou  moontlik  in
daardie provinsie met sy geweldsgeskiedenis dat  die  ANC  dalk  mag  regeer
sonder dat daar 'n verkiesing was.

In 1999 het die kiesers gestem dat die ANC  nie  'n  twee-derde  meerderheid
kry in hierdie Raad nie. Met die oorloop van lede na die  ANC  kry  die  ANC
nou 'n twee-derde meerderheid, waarmee verskanste artikels in  die  Grondwet
verander kan word. Dit is nou moontlik sonder dat daar 'n verkiesing was.

Ons het selfs  nou  partye  in  hierdie  Parlement  wat  nog  nooit  aan  'n
verkiesing deelgeneem het nie. Daarom sê die VF  dat  oorloop  ondemokraties
en  selfs  gevaarlik  is  in  die  Suid-Afrikaanse  situasie.  Ek  dank   u.
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER (FF): Madam Speaker, the FF has expressed  itself  in  this
House against the floor-crossing legislation and also voted against it.  The
question is why. Because we believe that it is undemocratic legislation  and
that it ignores the wishes of the voters.

We even believe that it could be dangerous and bring  instability  to  South
Africa. One could be in favour of  crossing  the  floor  in  a  constituency
system, in which the voters vote for a specific candidate, as  before  1994.
We cannot argue in favour of crossing the floor in  a  proportional  system,
in which the voters vote for a particular political  party.  The  percentage
of support that a political party receives from the  voters  is  also  in  a
precise ratio to the number of elected  members  that  will  serve  in  this
Parliament or other legislatures. The floor-crossing of members alters  this
ratio.

In KwaZulu-Natal, for example, voters voted that the ANC  would  not  govern
the province, but indeed the IFP. Floor-crossing in that province, with  its
history of violence, now makes it possible for the  ANC  to  govern  without
there having been elections.

In 1999 the voters voted that the ANC would not have a  two-thirds  majority
in this House. With the floor-crossing of members to the ANC it  now  has  a
two-thirds majority, with which entrenched sections in the Constitution  can
be changed. This is now possible without there having been an election.

We even now have parties in this Parliament that have never participated  in
an  election.  Therefore,  the  FF  states  that  crossing  the   floor   is
undemocratic and even dangerous in the  South  African  situation.  I  thank
you.]

           DIVIDENDS OF PETRO SA AND CEF GROUP STRENGTHEN TREASURY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr  M  T  GONIWE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  the  ANC  notes   with   profound
appreciation the recent special  dividend  of  R1,6 billion  contributed  by
Petro SA and the CEF Group to the Treasury.

Petro SA, which was formed in January  2002,  has  helped  turn  around  the
white elephant  Mossgas  into  a  possible  milk  cow  whose  proceeds  will
certainly contribute to the attainment of our overarching  goal  of  poverty
reduction. Petro SA and other state entities have a crucial role to play  in
increasing the resource base available to the  Treasury.  Most  importantly,
the declared dividend of R1,6 billion by Petro SA is further  proof  of  the
prudence of our economic strategies and policies.

We made hard choices because it was the right thing to do  and  now  we  are
reaping the fruits of the sacrifices we made. Our governance is  sound,  our
economic fundamentals are solid. The tide is turning for the  better.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

                        OPPOSITION ALTERNATIVE TO ANC

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr W P DOMAN (DA): Mevrou die Speaker, ons sluit met  groot  oortuiging  by
die DA aan. Ons het tot die gevolgtrekking gekom dat die  DA  besig  is  met
belangrike werk om 'n ware alternatief vir die ANC te skep. Hoe  groter  die
opposisie, hoe beter die regering. Die weg om die demokrasie in  Suid-Afrika
te versterk, is om die DA te versterk.

Ek is persoonlik beïndruk met die DA se vennootskap  met  die  IVP,  wat  'n
sterk swart ondersteuningsbasis het, en ook dat  die  DA,  veral  binne  die
opset van die Wes-Kaap en die Noord-Kaap, daarin slaag om  sterk  steun  uit
die bruin kieserskorps te trek. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die verkiesing in Swellendam, waar 40% van die  geregistreerde  kiesers  uit
die bruin gemeenskap kom, het dit onteenseglik bewys. As die vorige LUR  vir
Plaaslike Regering in die Wes-Kaap, is ek ook beïndruk met die groot  aantal
en gehalte van die bruin raadslede wat met die oorlopery die DA gekies  het.
Die DA is werklik 'n party vir almal, en die valse propaganda van  die  Nuwe
NP en die ANC dat die DA  net  'n  wit  party  is  wat  terughunker  na  die
verlede, moet met minagting verwerp word.

Die vernietiging van die Nuwe NP en die versterking van die DA  sal  kiesers
in die opposisiegeledere nuwe hoop gee,  hulle  hul  apatie  laat  staan  en
volgende jaar in groot getalle vir die DA laat stem. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ons bly getrou aan die oorweldigende  kiesersmandaat  van  2000  en  daarna,
bevestig met tussenverkiesing, dat daar eenheid  in  opposisiegeledere  moet
wees.  Dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  member's  statement
follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN (DA): Madam Speaker, we join the DA with great conviction.  We
have come to the conclusion that the DA  is  busy  with  important  work  in
creating a true alternative for the ANC. The  greater  the  opposition,  the
better the government. The way in which to  strengthen  democracy  in  South
Africa is to strengthen the DA.

I am personally impressed with the DA's partnership with the IFP, which  has
a strong black support basis, and that the DA, especially within  the  setup
of the Western Cape and the Northern Cape, has succeeded in  drawing  strong
support from the coloured electorate. [Interjections.]

The election in Swellendam, where 40% of the  registered  voters  come  from
the coloured community, has proved this beyond doubt. As the former MEC  for
Local Government in the Western Cape I am  also  impressed  with  the  large
number and quality of the coloured councillors who chose the DA  during  the
floor-crossing. The DA  is  really  a  party  for  everyone  and  the  false
propaganda of the New NP and the ANC that the DA is only a white party  that
yearns for the past should be rejected with contempt.

The destruction of the New NP and the strengthening of the DA will give  new
hope to voters in the opposition ranks, move them  away  from  their  apathy
and make them vote for the DA next year in large numbers. [Interjections.]

We remain committed to the overwhelming voters mandate  of  2000  and  after
that, confirmed with the interim election, that there  should  be  unity  in
the opposition ranks. Thank you. [Applause.]

                   CHILDREN KILLED IN CAPE FLATS VIOLENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): Madam Speaker, children are continuing to  be  killed
by stray bullets, most likely linked to gang  violence,  in  the  Cape  Town
area. The latest victim is young Tamsanqwa Manitshane, a  five-year-old  boy
from Khayelitsha. He was killed when gunfire erupted  outside  his  home  on
Friday 21 March, which was also Human Rights Day, after six men opened  fire
on and killed a young man.

Tamsanqwa is the fifth Cape Town child to be killed by  stray  bullets  this
month. Four other children have  died  and  another  was  injured  by  stray
bullets resulting from gang warfare. It is a sad day and  an  indication  of
just how much  society  has  degenerated  morally  when  innocent,  carefree
children are no longer safe playing outdoors or in the street outside  their
homes.

They are being robbed of their  childhood.  It  is  our  duty  to  take  the
necessary action to ensure that they can once again  just  be  children  and
not fear for their lives. This slaughter of innocents has to stop.  We  must
find a way of effectively controlling and eventually eliminating  gangs  and
gang violence.  If  we  do  not,  innocent  children  will  continue  to  be
murdered. [Applause.]

                            DEATH PENALTY POLICY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S J GOUS (New NP):  Madam  Speaker,  the  hon  Mrs  Camerer  drafted  the
following member's statement, but unfortunately she might not wish  to  make
the statement today owing to  her  new  position  and  the  constraints  now
placed on her. So I will read it on her behalf. [Interjections.] I quote  as
follows:


  The hon Mark Louw has called the leader of the New NP ``Hang  'em  high''
  van  Schalkwyk'',  because  the  New  NP   leader   has   advocated   the
  reintroduction of the death penalty for  the  most  heinous  murders  and
  rapes, even if this requires an amendment to the  Constitution.  The  hon
  Mark Louw should look around him. There  he  will  see  the  hon  Douglas
  ``Hang 'em high'' Gibson, the hon Tony ``Hang 'em high''  Leon,  the  hon
  Dene ``Hang 'em high'' Smuts, judging  by  their  various  statements  in
  favour of the death penalty.


  Part of the hon Mark Louw's problem is that the DA has no clear policy on
  the death penalty. They only have a free vote, which means that  in  this
  Parliament they have 39 different policies, unlike the New  NP.  Although
  we also have a free vote - because we regard life and death  issues  like
  the  death  penalty  and  abortion  as  issues  of   conscience   -   we,
  nevertheless, have a party position which reflects the view  of  a  large
  majority of our members in favour of the death penalty.

I thank you. [Applause.]

               STATE HOSPITAL DISPENSARIES CLOSED ON WEEKENDS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N C NKABINDE (UDM): Madam Speaker, it has come to  our  notice  that  the
dispensaries of some state hospitals are not open  over  weekends,  that  is
Saturdays  and  Sundays.  This  causes  a  very  serious  problem  for   the
communities being served by these institutions, especially  the  poorest  of
the poor who have to travel long  distances  to  reach  these  institutions.
Patients  are  seen  and  treated  by   medical   practitioners,   but   the
prescriptions are not obtainable  until  Monday.  Some  patients  spend  the
whole weekend sleeping on  benches,  without  any  basic  services  such  as
water, food and medication.

Prince Mshiyeni Hospital in Umlazi, Durban, is a classic example of  what  I
am talking about. This hospital is serving thousands of patients on a  daily
basis. Therefore we cannot allow such a situation to continue.

It seems as if one has to file  for  an  application  to  get  sick  between
Mondays and Fridays. The situation is worse at city day hospitals.  Patients
have to  provide  their  own  linen  when  they  are  admitted.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

                          EDUCATION KEY TO SUCCESS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S E M PHEKO (PAC): Madam Speaker, the PAC believes that education is  key
to the success of a nation in all its spheres  of  endeavour.  Education  is
the fountain of knowledge. Education is  a  weapon.  The  PAC  affirms  that
education is the only means by which all kinds of skills  can  be  acquired.
These skills  enable  a  nation  to  advance  technologically,  exploit  its
resources and process its raw materials to increase its wealth.

Our country is one of the richest, but, because it does not  provide  enough
education for its people, the majority are trampled on by  all  and  sundry,
especially economically and technologically.

To neglect the education of our children will destroy  our  nation  and  our
future. The PAC demands free education. No child must  be  denied  education
merely because his or her parents cannot afford the  school  fees.  That  is
why this past year the PAC supported the student boycott of  13  schools  in
Tsakana and Balfour. The students demanded the lowering of fees.  Many  poor
parents could not afford the high fees. The PAC  is  also  against  the  age
limit for leaving school. African children learn under  extremely  difficult
conditions. This delays their completing their studies in time.

The PAC also condemns age seven as the entry age to start  school.  Age  six
is reasonable. Last year 27 students aligned to the PAC  were  arrested  and
charged with criminal offences. I am happy, however,  to  announce  in  this
House that they have now all been acquitted.  The  magistrate  wisely  ruled
that they were not criminals, they were intelligent  persons  desiring  that
education be affordable to the  children  of  the  poorest  parents  in  our
country. I thank you. [Applause.]
The SPEAKER: Order! Does  any  Minister  wish  to  respond  to  a  statement
directed at him or her or concerning a Minister's portfolio?

                                 SCHOOL FEES

                            (Minister's response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, the trouble with the hon Pheko  is
that he does not understand the fundamental point that you should  not  make
cannon fodder of children, whether it his special  conference  in  Umtata  -
where you busload children to a conference and invalidate your conference  -
or you exploit young people in Balfour to deprive them of education.

A fundamental point that this House has reiterated  is  that  children  must
not be used for political purposes, whether by my party or any other  party.
It is vital for progress and development, as we  have  maintained  over  the
last few years, that children should have stability  and  peace  at  school.
The parents at Balfour themselves said: We would  like  to  continue  paying
the fees, which are not more than R100 a year, because it  is  necessary  to
get additional benefits for the school.

As for other issues he raised,  we  have  just  published  a  very  valuable
report - which is presumably in the library and, presumably, when  you  take
time off from exploiting children, you might read the report on the  funding
of schools. You will see that the primary recommendation  we  make  is  that
40% of our children at school should pay no fees whatsoever. If you  abolish
all fees - you wouldn't understand that; the  laws  of  economics  are  much
more complicated than you think  -  you  are  then  subsidising  the  middle
class. This is because the Government will then be providing the  amount  of
money the middle class pays for schooling to those schools. If you  want  to
have the  consequence  of  the  provision  of  money  to  the  middle  class
diminishing the amount of state investment in the working  class,  then  you
are a better man than I am, Gunga Din.

                        TUBERCULOSIS IN SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Minister's response)

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Madam Speaker, I stand to associate myself with  the
statement made by Mrs Tshwete on tuberculosis in this country  and  also  to
give additional information.

Yesterday we launched a campaign in Port Elizabeth on  advocacy  and  social
mobilisation, and I would like  to  invite  all  members  of  Parliament  to
assist us and be the ambassadors in the national campaign on TB  control  in
our country. As you all know, of the 22  countries  that  bear  the  highest
burden of TB, South Africa occupies the ninth place.  The  message  that  we
would like the members of Parliament to assist us with is to begin to  share
information about the signs and symptoms of tuberculosis  such  as  a  cough
for over two weeks, unexplained weight loss, and night sweats.  Please  come
to our health institutions and facilities for examination and  testing.  You
can be sure to always find caring nurses and doctors who  will  provide  you
with the medicine for free. Please join us in this campaign.  Remember  that
if you do not complete your treatment, it will cost us R20 000, but  if  you
do and the TB treatment is administered for six months,  it  only  costs  us
R400, as opposed to R20 000, which is what it costs once you have multidrug-
resistant  TB.  Please  be  our  ambassadors  in  the  national  TB  control
programme.

The hon member of the  UDM  spoke  about  the  Prince  Msheni  Hospital  and
patients going without medicine. May I invite the  member  to  discuss  this
with me, because I am not aware of what she just said to the House. I  would
very happy to engage her about the  hospital  because,  as  far  as  we  are
concerned, it has a very capable CEO and I have never heard of  patients  in
Prince Msheni Hospital going without medicine. Thank you. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Before the hon Minister of Defence speaks, may  I  alert
you to my original comment, which is to respond to a statement  directed  at
you or concerning your portfolio.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, there was a statement that was  made
here relating to my party. May I not respond to that?

The SPEAKER: I am sorry,  Minister.  No,  in  terms  of  the  Rules,  it  is
required that you deal with your portfolio. It would have been open to  your
party to use the opportunity of ministerial statements to respond  had  they
wished to do so.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I will come back, Madam Speaker. [Interjections.]

Whip if he is moving that the proportions reflected on the Order  Paper  are
the ones in terms of which we will speak.

                     BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT STRATEGY

                           (Responses by parties)

Mr  C  M  LOWE:  Madam  Speaker,  apartheid   was   monstrously   evil.   It
systematically excluded the majority of South Africans from  the  mainstream
of their country's economic life. It deliberately  prohibited  black  people
from generating self-employment and prevented them selling their labour  and
applying their entrepreneurial skills where  and  as  they  pleased.  It  is
perhaps wholly appropriate that today as the very party that introduced  and
systematically enforced that brutal and  monstrous  regime  writhes  in  its
death throes, we address the economic legacy that apartheid has left us.
The DA strongly supports black economic empowerment as a  means  to  growing
our economy and ensuring all South Africans have access  to  employment  and
entrepreneurial opportunities. But we have to do more than that. Much  more.
It is deeply disturbing that, ten years from our first democratic  election,
in many respects nothing much has changed. While we have  seen  the  massive
enrichment of the elite few in  the  name  of  what  has  passed  for  black
empowerment, for the vast majority of black South Africans, the  promise  of
a better life has failed to materialise and they are just as  excluded  from
the mainstream as ever they  were.  Political  freedom  has  not  in  itself
brought economic freedom. The RDP has come and gone and Gear  is  still  not
given the full support it requires to make it  truly  effective,  while  the
debacle around the Mining Charter which saw R50 billion swept  off  the  JSE
in an instant was hopefully a sobering lesson to Government  and  one  which
they will not easily repeat.

You have got a big job ahead of you, Mr Minister, one which  I  believe  you
are up to. I must confess: With Government's track  record  not  being  very
good, the cynic in me  sees  that  in  this  election  year,  Government  is
desperately casting around for something, anything, to deliver  on  election
promises.

Be that as it may, can the strategy deliver? Frankly, I am concerned at  the
ability of your  DTI  to  deliver  the  goods  and  run  the  administration
required to make it happen. Is the DTI up to it? It is regularly  criticised
and,  in  my  opinion,  with  some  justification  for  leaving   telephones
unanswered, creating good-looking and good-sounding strategy  documents  but
then not delivering on job creation and small  business  promotion.  At  the
end of the day, it is all about jobs.

In recent weeks, the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry heard from  a
number of DTI and Government-funded organisations and asked them to  account
for the billions of rand of  taxpayers'  money  they  have  used  to  create
investment  opportunities  and  jobs.  We  have  seen  wonderful  plans  and
programmes, clever strategies and first-rate brochures, none of  which  come
cheap.  Frankly,  a  lot  less  of  hard  evidence  of  the  jobs   created,
individuals empowered and money well spent. Many  did  not  even  provide  a
financial statement. The Isibaya Fund, for example, cited in paragraph  252,
has failed to perform at anywhere near the level it should have done.  There
are other examples too.

We support the definition of broad black economic empowerment  in  paragraph
322, and the four key principles in the strategy. It  must  be  broad-based.
It must be an inclusive process. It must be associated with good  governance
and it must be part of our growth strategy but not the only aspect of it.

Growth remains the key and it is  essential  that  there  be  certainty  and
transparency in respect of all aspects of the strategy, otherwise  suspicion
will grow that inside information  and  personal  contacts  with  key  role-
players  are  the  most  important  requirements   for   being   successful.
Unemployment is the issue, combined  with  a  critical  skills  shortage  in
certain sectors. You know the statistics. Jobs are  the  answer;  growth  is
the means. Black economic empowerment is necessary - there  is  no  doubt  -
but it cannot a panacea for everything.  Growth  levels  at  6%  so  vitally
needed if we are  to  succeed  will  only  materialise  on  the  backing  of
international  investment,  and  investors  require  confidence.  Confidence
comes when the top leadership starts showing the  way,  when  our  President
shows the way on Aids, on Zimbabwe. That inspires confidence and will  bring
in investment. You have a big job on your hands. [Time expired.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, there can be little doubt  that  nine  years
after the end of apartheid, South Africans of all walks of life  enjoy  some
of the most comprehensive political freedoms. Yet  political  freedoms  have
been slow in being translated into  true  economic  emancipation  and,  more
accurately, economic  participation  for  historically  disadvantaged  South
Africans. Herein lies a great danger to our young democracy.  It  is  almost
inconceivable that a fragile  democracy  in  the  process  of  consolidation
would be able to long withstand massive  social  upheaval  caused  by  deep-
seated poverty and the economic exclusion  of  those  who  had  historically
been virtually completely excluded.

The IFP therefore welcomed the approach taken by the Mining  Charter,  which
went beyond just  ownership  participation  for  historically  disadvantaged
South Africans to including human resource development,  employment  equity,
enterprise development, preferential  procurement,  skills  development  and
transfer and  management  participation.  Taken  into  consideration,  these
various aspects of  a  broad-based  BEE  strategy  would,  in  our  opinion,
provide the best opportunities for success. It is  therefore  heartening  to
see virtually all these initiatives taken  up  in  Government's  broad-based
BEE strategy as announced by Minister Erwin on 19 March.

We also welcome the additional investment of R10 billion and the use of  the
balance scorecard approach to ensure compliance and  progress.  Furthermore,
the IFP supports the creation of enabling legislation and the  establishment
of a BEE advisory council.

Private South African businesses are often accused of not  doing  enough  to
accelerate BEE. No doubt this  is  true  in  some  instances  where  window-
dressing, fronting and lip service are the order of the day. This is  not  a
general  trend.  Surely  business  leaders  recognise  that  a  stable   and
democratic society and an inclusive economy present  them  with  their  best
long-term opportunity to do what they do best, in  other  words,  conducting
business and making profits.

This realisation has been evident in the full participation of  business  in
formulating the empowerment charters in the liquid fuel sector  and  in  the
mining  sector.  This  participation  in  the  charter  approach  would   be
encouraged in the other sectors of the economy. The IFP  also  welcomes  the
fact that the Minister's announcement has  brought  more  certainty  to  the
business world about BEE intentions. There is nothing a business hates  more
than an unapparent and unpredictable and unstable  operational  environment.
Such conditions stifle new enterprise development and  new  investments  are
often placed on hold in what is perceived to  be  a  high-risk  environment.
The announcement and the forthcoming legislative and regulatory  initiatives
go a long way toward addressing business fears, uncertainties and concerns.

In conclusion, I would love to express the IFP's hopes that the  broad-based
BEE strategy would indeed deliver meaningful and  large-scale  participation
of historically disadvantaged South Africans in  our  economy.  If  it  does
not, our young democracy might face an unstable and unpredictable future.  I
thank you.

Dr R T RHODA: Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to respond and  give
support to the statement made by the hon Minister of Trade and  Industry  on
19 March 2003 on the Black Economic Empowerment Strategy. For as long  as  I
can remember, structural barriers and  influential  obstacles,  remnants  of
colonialism have deliberately prevented blacks from participating  fully  in
the South African economy.

For too long, they have been kept out  of  the  economic  mainstream.  These
barriers and obstacles have  now  by  and  large  been  identified.  If  our
economy remains unequal as it is, it simply will not grow. It  is  important
that all citizens play a major role in our economy and assist  in  the  full
transformation of the black South African business sector. Blacks also  need
to  feel  that  they  are  participating  in  the  ownership  and  the  true
management of South African companies, a greater promotion I foresee in  the
partnership between the public sector and the private sector, and this  must
be encouraged.

Black economic empowerment will be an integrated and coherent  socioeconomic
process that will directly contribute  to  the  economic  transformation  of
South Africa. It will, I am certain, bring about  significant  increases  in
the number of ordinary black people who will truly manage,  truly  own,  and
truly control the South African economy in the future. A deracialisation  of
South Africa's economy is essential for economic and  political  and  social
stability. The end result must be higher levels  of  black  ownership,  more
entrepreneurs, more managers, more professionals and more  skilled  persons.
Black economic empowerment goes beyond political and social obligations.

Finally, I want to say that successful implementation of the BEE will  be  a
key factor towards growth and equity, towards the  achievement  of  a  South
Africa characterised by rapid growth, export expansion, stable prices,  full
employment and  a  relatively  equitable  income  distribution.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr C T FROLICK:  Madam  Speaker,  and  hon  members,  the  long-awaited  BEE
strategy is strongly welcomed. We sincerely hope  that  this  strategy  will
address two crucial challenges of black  economic  empowerment  policies  to
date.

The first challenge is directed at the  current  BEE  efforts,  in  that  it
operates from a small base. It is hoped that the new strategy  will  broaden
the base of BEE and thus provide access to the economic mainstream  for  the
millions of South Africans currently  excluded.  It  is  vital  to  see  the
strategy  translated  into  extensive  opportunities  for   emerging   small
businessmen and women with the necessary  support  structures  to  transform
them into viable job-creating entities. If the  strategy  succeeds  in  this
respect, we can expect a growing and equitable  business  sector,  one  that
creates space for the  current  and  the  potential  entrepreneurs  of  this
country.

The second challenge deals with the general uncertainty regarding  BEE  aims
and the mechanisms for achieving it. Such a climate of  uncertainty  in  the
business sector can cause market instability. A  striking  example  of  this
occurred last year when the  Mining  Charter  was  leaked  and  sent  mining
stocks into a spiral.

It is necessary that we recognise the hard work that the BEE commission  put
into this subject. Their work has been translated into a new strategy and  a
draft Bill. It is now up to us to  ensure  that  the  broad  intentions  are
honoured and that the final Bill processed by Parliament lives up  to  these
intentions and does not become a watered-down product. [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: The ACDP supports the Minister's statement  because  of  the
broad nature of the BEE strategy announced. As a party we believe  that  all
South Africans, irrespective of race, gender or  class  must  share  in  the
economic growth of the country.

We are particularly pleased by the fact that, prima facie, the  strategy  is
not just an empowerment of the elite but goes  further  to  ensure  economic
and social empowerment. It remains  to  be  seen,  though,  as  to  how  the
Government will implement this broad strategy in the light  of  the  present
macroeconomic strategy, which is shedding jobs whilst increasing profits.

True economic empowerment will have to ensure job creation and retention  of
the existing jobs. The challenge is whether the newly empowered  elite  will
carry this important task in the spirit of  ubuntu.  Government  has  a  big
responsibility  to  ensure  that  its  industrial  strategy,  for   example,
supports labour-intensive industries, instead of too  much  focus  on  those
industries which are capital intensive, in order to ensure  the  empowerment
of the poorest. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr C P MULDER: Agb Mevrou die Speaker, die VF  het  kennis  geneem  van  die
Regering se strategie vir swart ekonomiese bemagtiging. Dit  is  korrek  dat
mense in Suid-Afrika bemagtig moet word en ons verstaan  dit.  Ons  wil  dit
egter wel onder die Regering se aandag bring dat u 'n fout  sal  maak  as  u
aanvaar  dat  alle  ander  mense,  blankes,  maar  ook  Afrikaanssprekendes,
outomaties reeds bemagtig is. Dit is nie noodwendig die geval nie.  Die  agb
leier van  die  IVP  het  vroeër  vanjaar  tydens  die  begrotingspos  gesê:
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Hon  Madam  Speaker,  the  FF  has  noted  the  Government's
strategy for black economic empowerment. It is true  that  people  in  South
Africa have to be empowered and we understand that. However, we  would  like
to bring to the Government's attention that you would be  making  a  mistake
if you accept that all other people - whites, but also Afrikaans speakers  -
are automatically already empowered. This is not necessarily the  case.  The
hon leader of the IFP said during the Vote earlier this year:]


  A distinction should be drawn between what is called black enrichment and
  black empowerment.

We also feel very strongly about that. The strategy, and I  quote  from  the
Minister's statement -
  ... proposes that BEE should be broad-based and inclusive and  result  in
  both higher levels of black ownership as well as a  reduction  in  income
  inequalities.

Dit is nie dat mens nie daarmee kan saamstem nie; ons verstaan dit. Wat  wel
waar is, is dat daar reeds 'n nuwe swart  elite  geskep  is.  Ons  weet  dit
almal en ek is seker hulle hoef nie verder bemagtig  te  word  nie.  As  die
doel is om werk te skep in Suid-Afrika en almal die geleentheid te gee,  dan
kan mens dit ondersteun, maar nie net swartmense nie. Ander wat 'n  behoefte
het, moet ook bemagtig word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is not that one cannot agree with it; we understand it.  What  is  true,
however, is that a new black elite has already been  created.  We  all  know
this and I am sure that they do not have to be  empowered  any  further.  If
the  aim  is  to  create  work  in  South  Africa  and  give  everybody   an
opportunity, then one can support it, but not only black people. Others  who
have a need should also be empowered.]

Mr I S  MFUNDISI:  Madam  Speaker,  when  South  Africa  acquired  political
freedom some nine years ago, economic freedom was still  wanting.  The  time
has come that economic freedom can also be acquired. In much  the  same  way
as political emancipation was brought in through tough  proactive  means  of
settling  deadlines,  economic  freedom  also  needs  proactive,  yet  legal
measures to be put in place. The UCDP  hopes  that  the  envisaged  advisory
council will be representative of all sectors so  that  all  voices  can  be
heard. All well-meaning South Africans  should  applaud  this  move,  as  no
group of people should be viewed or kept as beggars into perpetuity.

Avenues of accessing wealth have to be opened to all in the same way and  at
the same time so that the haves amongst the  blacks  should  not  have  more
while the have-nots in their midst continue to have nothing.

According to the words of  the  Minister,  the  envisaged  empowerment  will
expand beyond political and social obligations.  We  support  the  move.  We
shall watch the proceedings with great interest. We feel that the  tide  has
to be taken on. Who knows? It might lead  to  fortune  for  the  poor  black
masses of this country. Thank you.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Speaker, the PAC agrees with the principle of the  BEE
strategy, provided it is  not  confined  to  the  black  elite  but  to  the
economic advancement of all the African people as a  whole.  We  know  about
their national dispossession and how they  were  deliberately  impoverished,
particularly beginning with the Native Land Act of 1913.

African businesses  in  the  rural  areas  and  in  African  townships  have
collapsed.  African  businesspeople  are  worse  off  now.   Where   African
businesspeople once thrived, their business has now been taken over by  non-
Africans. If BEE means anything, it must assist the small African  business,
and look at bank laws which affect their  borrowing.  Everywhere  we  go  in
this country, many African businesspeople are  on  their  knees.  They  have
gone bankrupt. They are asking: Whom is BEE assisting? Who  are  they?  Some
of us have never met them. Thank you.

Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Madam  Speaker,   the   physical   burden   and   social
instabilities  in  the  country  are  influenced  by  poverty  and  economic
inequalities that also  seriously  limit  the  South  African  market.  This
certainly influences the need for and success of BEE.

The MF finds the strategies that BEE is set to adopt suitable and calls  for
the private and public sectors to work in  unison  to  make  it  a  success.
However, the programme should be instituted proportionally  to  ensure  that
no persons are marginalised as a result of it and that all  minorities  have
an  equal  chance,  protection  and  representation  in  the  South  African
economy.

Socioeconomic inequalities and structural deficiencies need to be  overcome.
However, to improve the quality of life of South Africans, the focus has  to
be set on small and medium enterprises as a key factor in doing so.

The MF supports the BEE initiatives. The hon President, in his state of  the
nation address, has set aside R10 billion for BEE initiatives over a  period
of five years, which is a very welcome gesture.

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, first of all, I  must  congratulate  Parliament,
because within an hour after giving in my forms, the name of the  new  party
is on your list. I am speaking on behalf of the National Action.

Die Nasionale Aksie staan nie afsydig teenoor swart bemagtiging nie. Dis  'n
realiteit. Ons glo dat die kloof tussen ryk en arm in  Suid-Afrika  verklein
moet word, maar dan oor die hele spektrum en nie net  volgens  die  rasselyn
nie. Verder kan ons nie mense bemagtig deur pasellas en presente  nie,  maar
deur toerusting, bekwaamheid en opleiding. Dit lyk vir my asof die  Minister
se voornemens wel hieraan voldoen.

Vereistes vir bemagtiging sluit die volgende in: Meriete  moet  altyd  geld;
tweedens moet gesonde ekonomiese beginsels gehandhaaf word  en  derdens,  om
die vergelyking met sport te tref, nie kwotas nie,  maar  ontwikkeling.  Die
Minister se veldtog lyk vir my of dit val binne die parameters  van  gesonde
ekonomiese beginsels  en  die  Nasionale  Aksie  kan  hom  positief  daaroor
uitspreek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The National Action does not have a neutral stance  with  regard  to  black
empowerment. It is a reality. We believe that the gap between rich and  poor
in South Africa should be reduced, but then  it  should  happen  across  the
whole spectrum and not only  along  racial  lines.  Furthermore,  we  cannot
empower people  with  hand-outs  and  gifts,  but  we  can  -  by  means  of
equipment,  skills  and  training.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  Minister's
intentions do indeed meet these requirements.
Prerequisites for empowerment include the  following:  Merit  should  always
apply;  secondly,  sound  economic  principles  should  be  maintained   and
thirdly, to draw a comparison with sport, not quotas,  but  development.  It
seems to me that the Minister's campaign  falls  within  the  parameters  of
sound economic principles and  the  National  Action  can  speak  positively
about it.]

The SPEAKER: Hon Mr Aucamp, I want to alert you and other parties  that  the
name NA is usually used to mean National Assembly and I am not sure if  this
is a take-over bid or not. [Laughter.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Speaker, the BEE strategy announced  by  the  hon
Minister as a full-scale programme to address access by blacks  to  economic
activities that are meant to improve their quality of life is  supported  by
Azapo. What remains to be seen is how the state will  facilitate  access  to
capital and collateral.

As we all know, this arena of struggle by black people, that  is  of  access
to finance and the concept of collateral, has  always  been  a  very  thorny
area indeed. Azapo would like to see the strengthening of financial  systems
that have been practised by black  people  over  the  ages.  These  are  the
stokvels and credit unions. We hope that this  strategy  will  also  address
these financial systems so that they can  be  brought  into  the  mainstream
economic activities of black people. I thank you.

Ms B M NTULI: Madam Speaker, hon members, we in the ANC  welcome  the  long-
awaited announcement of the BEE strategy. The Minister  informed  the  House
on the progress made by Government in setting out a policy on  BEE  and  the
adoption of the strategy by Cabinet. This is a realisation of the  objective
of accelerating growth and development and also pushing back  the  frontiers
of poverty in the spirit of Batho Pele.

This  strategy  will  address  issues  around   marginalisation   of   black
businesses by apartheid  policies  that  had  many  barriers  to  entry  for
blacks. It will also meet the challenges of job creation and small  business
development in the rural and urban areas. The Minister  indicated  that  the
strategy  will  outline  policy  objectives  as  well  as  instruments  that
Government will use. They include an Act that would allow for the  formation
of the guidelines and codes, and the  establishment  of  advisory  councils.
This is very important because the department alone cannot and will  not  be
able to do the job.

The advisory council, I hope, will be there to advise and also  measure  the
success of the strategy and monitor progress and check  whether  our  people
are not just fronting, and ensuring that the implementation of the  strategy
impacts positively on the lives of all South Africans.

The formation of partnerships and charters with the private sector  is  also
welcomed. When the Minister defined the strategy, he said that it should  be
broad-based and inclusive, and it should result in  both  higher  levels  of
black ownership ... ubunikazi bamabhizinisi into eyayingenzeki ngoba  abantu
abamnyama   babengenabo   ubunikazi   bamabhizinisi   [business   ownership,
something that was not happening before because black people never had  such
ownership].

As well as the reduction in the  income  inequality,  it  should  result  in
effective black participation in the economy and increased participation  in
managerial and skilled occupations. This  is  important.  That  is  why  the
process will include the element of human resource development  because,  in
the past, education and skills were a privilege for blacks but a  right  for
whites. We hope that Khula and Ntsika, IDC and  other  sister  organisations
and institutions will now participate  fully  in  developing  entrepreneurs,
allowing people to control enterprises and to own economic assets.  We  also
believe that the strategy will create  an  enabling  environment  for  black
businesspeople  to  have  access  to  finance  by  developing   a   workable
empowerment-financing institutional arrangement.

Finally, the participation of all the stakeholders  should  not  stop  here.
Black business councils, black business working groups, big business,  trade
and industries, Nedlac and others - well done! I hope that there will  be  a
monitoring system in place and that appropriate parastatals will  also  play
an active role in the strategy. We must also look at how we integrate  other
strategies like  the  IMS,  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development
Programme and the Urban Renewal Strategy.

Once again, thank you for creating a platform for the  rigorous  development
of the economy that will impact on the  lives  of  all  South  Africans.  We
support the strategy.
Those on my right today are saying that nothing  has  changed.  They  forget
... [Interjections] ... on my left ...  They  are  saying  once  again  that
nothing has changed. They forget that they always  vote  against  all  Bills
that deal with transformation in this House, and nobody said that  BEE  will
be a ...

Mr K M ANDREW: Go and learn your basic facts and then come and talk to us.

Ms B M NTULI: Shut up! Shut up! [Interjections.]

We  appreciate  what  you  have  done,  Mr  Minister.   All   in   all   ...
[Interjections.]

Mr K M ANDREW: On a point of order: Madam  Speaker,  I  would  have  thought
that ``shut up'' was not exactly parliamentary. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: I am afraid members are using the word ``shut up''. The  actual
word used may have been translated differently. We need to look at that.

Ms B M NTULI: That is the character  of  the  overwhelming  right-wing.  All
they do is vote against everything that intends pushing back  the  frontiers
of poverty in the country. They do not care about the lives of people.  They
care about themselves and about the riches that will  come  into  their  own
pockets, rather than the overwhelming poor majority in this  country.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Debate on Vote No 3 - Foreign Affairs:

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, hon members of the  National
Assembly, Ministers and Deputy Ministers, members of the  diplomatic  corps,
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,  before  I  start  my  speech  I
would like to acknowledge a known friend of our struggle,  Helena  Pastoors,
who's sitting in the gallery. [Applause.]

Let me extend  my  appreciation  and  gratitude  to  Dr  Pallo  Jordan,  the
Chairman of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs, and  to  members  of
the committee for their co-operation and assistance. I also  appreciate  the
understanding shown by members  of  Parliament  for  my  absence  from  this
House. I would like to assure the  hon  Boy  Geldenhuys  that  this  is  not
because I think absence makes the heart grow fonder. [Laughter.]

I also extend my gratitude to President Thabo  Mbeki  and  Deputy  President
Jacob Zuma for their guidance  and  assistance.  I  also  thank  my  Cabinet
colleagues for their co-operation and support.

I would like to extend a special word of  appreciation  to  Deputy  Minister
Aziz Pahad, to Acting Director-General Abdul Minty and to all the  officials
of the department for their hard work and for  all  their  efforts.  I  also
take this opportunity to thank my family for their  love  and  unconditional
support.

We are all relieved that  the  issue  of  taxation  of  our  representatives
abroad has been resolved. I am also pleased to  inform  the  House  that  we
will soon be building the departmental headquarters in Pretoria.

President Thabo Mbeki, in addressing the opening of the ANC National  Policy
Conference in September 2002, said:


  ... we can state, without any fear of contradiction, that  in  less  than
  one decade we have transformed our country from  being  an  international
  pariah,  a  negative  force  in  favour  of  racism  globally,  reaction,
  destabilisation, aggression and war, to an important international player
  for democracy, social progress, national independence and  equality,  and
  peace.

I am sure that all of us here would acknowledge  these  truths.  We  made  a
conscious choice, as a people and as a nation, at  a  particular  crossroads
in our history. We chose peace and sustainable development instead  of  war,
reconciliation instead of revenge, dialogue instead of confrontation.

We embraced nonracialism, nonsexism and democracy, and charted our  path  to
be a humble and tolerant nation. As a consequence of these choices, we  have
come to learn to be at one with our geography and our history, and to be  at
home in the world.

Today all South Africans, both black and white, can travel anywhere  in  the
world with pride. There is no longer any need for any of our people to  deny
their nationality because of the indefensible shame of apartheid.

Whilst, indeed, the tide has turned here at home, the world is at a  crucial
crossroads. Some would want us to choose a path where the world is  premised
on the law of survival of the fittest, which departs from the  very  essence
and founding principles of the United Nations.

I would like to remind this House what those principles are. I quote:


  We the peoples of  the  United  Nations  determined  to  save  succeeding
  generations from the scourge of war, which  twice  in  our  lifetime  has
  brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm  faith  in  fundamental
  human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the  equal
  rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and to  establish
  conditions under which justice and respect for  the  obligations  arising
  from treaties and other sources of international law can  be  maintained,
  and to promote social progress and better standards  of  life  in  larger
  freedom, and for these ends to practice tolerance and  live  together  in
  peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our  strength  to
  maintain  international  peace  and  security,  and  to  ensure,  by  the
  acceptance of principles and  the  institution  of  methods,  that  armed
  forces shall not be used, save in the  common  interest,  and  to  employ
  international machinery for the promotion  of  the  economic  and  social
  advancement of all peoples.

This is the world that the founders of the United Nations wanted -  a  world
of peace, security, solidarity, dignity and equality of all  human  persons;
a world of tolerance and good neighbourliness. The  Charter  of  the  United
Nations clearly defines the world that we should  be  building.  The  United
Nations, imperfect as it may be, is the only  instrument  that  governs  the
international political system and gives  legality  and  legitimacy  to  our
actions.

The founders of the United Nations wanted us to build a world based  on  the
centrality of multilateralism, which would be respected  by  all  and  which
would make international governance predictable. But those who  want  us  to
depart from the principles of the charter want us to believe ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Minister. Deputy Chief  Whip,  are
you rising on a point of order?

Mr A C NEL: Chairperson, I know that the DP  has  turned  its  back  on  the
principle  of  multilateralism.  But  does  that  mean  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition has to turn his back on the Minister? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, please continue.

The  MINISTER  OF  FOREIGN  AFFAIRS:  Those  who  want  us  to  depart   ...
[Interjections.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Please  continue,  hon  Minister.
[Interjections.]

The LEADER  OF  THE  OPPOSITION:  I'm  sorry  you're  so  badly  served  ...
[Inaudible.] ... by your Whips.

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Okay, having said that,  can  we  continue?
[Interjections.] Thank you.

Those who want us to depart from the principles of the charter  want  us  to
believe that the powerful, the rich and the technologically advanced  should
rule the world using their economic and military  might.  They  want  us  to
build a world in which the rich and the powerful can impose  their  will  on
the poor and the weak, in which the powerful can change regimes at  will,  a
world in which the lives of the innocent  and  weak  are  not  protected,  a
world of the survival of the fittest. This will lead to a  new  world  order
outside the framework of the United Nations.

The multilateral system of global governance must remain our  only  response
to all the challenges facing humanity  today.  We  must  have  common  rules
shared and applied equally by all, without fear or favour.

Ben Okri, in his work Way of Being Free, writes:


  They tell me that nature is the survival of the fittest. And yet look how
  many wondrous gold and yellow fishes prosper amongst the silent stones of
  the ocean  beds,  while  sharks  eternally  prowl  the  waters  in  their
  impossible dreams of oceanic domination and while whales become  extinct;
  ... how many butterflies and iguanas thrive, while  elephants  turn  into
  endangered species,  and  while  even  lions  growl  in  their  dwindling
  solitude.


  There is no such thing as a powerless people. There are  only  those  who
  have not seen and have not used their power and will.  It  would  seem  a
  miraculous feat, but it is possible for  the  undervalued  ones  to  help
  create a beautiful new era in human history. New vision should come  from
  those who suffer most and who love life the most.

As  a  country  which  voluntarily  disarmed  itself  of  weapons  of   mass
destruction, South Africa strongly believes in a world free of  all  weapons
of mass destruction. Ideally, no  state  should  possess  such  weapons.  We
therefore made every  effort  to  ensure  the  full  implementation  of  all
relevant UN Resolutions, including 1441. It is for this reason that we  made
every effort to ensure the peaceful disarmament of Iraq and agreed with  the
inspectors when they said that they needed more time. We  still  think  that
was the correct route to take.
We must be encouraged, though, and be part of the peoples of the  world  who
have expressed their opposition to  war  in  solidarity  with  the  ordinary
people of Iraq, not because of their support for the regime, but because  of
their love of peace and for their understanding of the pain,  suffering  and
destruction that  war  brings.  The  international  community,  through  the
United Nations, should do all it can to minimise the humanitarian crisis  in
Iraq.

We must reassert the centrality of the United Nations as the only legal  and
legitimate authority for our collective peace and security in the world.  As
South Africa we shall continue to make a humble contribution  towards  peace
and stability in the world in general and on our continent in particular.

It is for these reasons that we  are  involved  in  Burundi,  the  DRC,  the
Comoros and Cote D'Ivoire, and we are about to  participate  in  the  Sudan.
And it is for these very reasons that  our  armed  forces  and  our  Defence
Force are involved in peacekeeping missions.

Recently we saw  the  worst  forms  of  terrorism  in  Kenya,  Tanzania,  on
September 11, and in Bali. Again, we have  to  continue  to  work  together,
through the United Nations, to rid the  world  of  terrorism.  We  can  only
succeed if we do this collectively and comprehensively.

Racism is growing in the world, sometimes assuming more insidious forms.  In
trying to build a better world, we have to fight the scourge of racism.

A Bahá'í scholar wrote, and I quote:


  Consider the flowers of a garden: though different in kind, colour,  form
  and shape, yet, inasmuch as they are  refreshed  by  the  waters  of  one
  spring, revived by the breath of one wind, invigorated by the rays of one
  sun, this diversity increaseth their charm, and addeth unto their beauty.


  How unpleasing to the eye if all  flowers  and  plants,  the  leaves  and
  blossoms, the fruits, the branches and the trees of that garden were  all
  the same shape and colour! Diversity of hues, form and  shape,  enricheth
  and adorneth the garden, and heighteneth the effect thereof.

[Applause.]
The implementation of the Durban Declaration and Plan  of  Action  from  the
World Conference  Against  Racism,  Racial  Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and
Related Intolerance is all the more urgent. Seeking  a  better  life  and  a
better world for all must mean the rescue of the poor of the world  and  the
globally marginalised from despair, misery and impoverishment,  as  well  as
the restoration of hope.

Lasting peace cannot be consolidated without addressing the  growing  global
inequities of our time. We have sufficient resources globally  to  create  a
better life for the world and its people.

The people of the South need to reinforce their  own  ability  and  capacity
for initiative, representation and negotiation in the multilateral  fora  of
the world. We have started the revitalisation of the  Non-Aligned  Movement;
and President Thabo Mbeki and other leaders of the South  have  collectively
evolved a coherent agenda for the Non-Aligned Movement and G7 and China.

As Africans, and as sons and daughters of Africa, we have rejected the Afro-
pessimism that condemns us to poverty and to the  perpetual  denial  of  our
dignity, intellect  and  strength.  In  coming  together  to  determine  the
correct route for our own development, we have launched the  African  Union,
and we have given concrete meaning to the dream of  the  peoples  of  Africa
that Africa must unite. Africa must take her rightful place as an  equal  in
the affairs of the world.

The launch and  inaugural  meeting  of  the  African  Union  reaffirmed  the
decision  that  the  New  Partnership  for  Africa's   Development,   Nepad,
constitutes its programme for  the  socioeconomic  regeneration  of  Africa.
This enables us to  tell  the  world  that  we,  the  Africans,  have  taken
ownership of our own development as the architects of  Nepad.  We  can  make
bold to say that Nepad is premised on African  control  of  its  programmes,
with African leaders accepting openly and unequivocally that they will  play
their part in ending poverty and bringing about sustainable development.

We  are  forging  a  genuine  partnership  amongst  ourselves  and   amongst
countries of the South for the realisation of the  African  Renaissance  and
the African century. We  are  also  engaging  countries  of  the  North  and
multilateral organisations as partners in our development.
The socioeconomic upliftment of the  lives  of  African  people,  especially
African women, will ensure a better life for all of us who are part of  this
great family. We must recognise the critical role that women  must  play  in
our development. They need  to  be  integrated  into  and  be  part  of  the
decision-making strata of our society. Even in matters  of  security,  women
must play a central role.

As hon  members  would  recall,  in  its  endeavour  to  make  a  meaningful
contribution to Africa, this House  has  offered  to  host  the  Pan-African
Parliament. The Pan-African Parliament has to address itself to  the  issues
of African peace and solidarity and to Africa's  sustained  development.  We
express the hope that this House will also speed up the ratification of  the
protocol on peace and security.

As you are all aware, South Africa will be celebrating the 40th  anniversary
of the founding of the Organisation of African Unity on Africa Day,  25  May
this year. This will enable us to thank the continent  and  its  people  for
their long solidarity with our own liberation struggle, and to focus on  the
continued quest for unity, development and solidarity.

South Africa will be hosting an AU ministerial meeting  that  will  discuss,
among other things, co-operation between Africa and  the  African  diaspora,
and a common defence policy for the African continent.

In this context, the bicentennial celebration of  the  proclamation  of  the
independence of the Republic of Haiti in January next year takes on  special
significance. The South African Government and, indeed, the AU have  decided
to link the 10th anniversary of democracy  in  South  Africa  to  the  200th
Haitian celebrations. These celebrations  will  bring  together  the  oldest
independent country in the African  diaspora  and  the  youngest  democratic
country on the African continent in a  great  statement  of  solidarity  and
strength.

As part of building a  better  world,  a  world  of  solidarity,  peace  and
stability, we have a responsibility towards the peoples of  Southern  Africa
who are gripped by a devastating drought which has resulted  in  famine.  We
have contributed maize and other forms of humanitarian assistance to  Angola
and other countries in the region.

Furthermore, in light of recent developments, we express our hope  that  the
Zimbabwean people will choose the path of peaceful dialogue rather than  the
route of confrontation. We  shall  continue  to  work  with  the  people  of
Zimbabwe to find a solution to these challenges. In this  regard,  the  SADC
foreign Ministers will be visiting Zimbabwe soon.

The  millennium  goals,  together  with  the  Johannesburg  Declaration  and
Programme of Action of the World Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  have
provided humanity with concrete ways of advancing  the  development  agenda.
We shall ensure that a follow-up and implementation programme is in place.

In conclusion, I would like to say that the days that lie  ahead  are  going
to be very trying for the international community. We have  to  re-establish
the unity of the international community and the centrality  of  the  United
Nations in dealing with the aftermath of the war.

Let the children of Iraq and the children of the world play as children  and
dream about the future. Save them from the nightmare of war.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr C W EGLIN: Mr Chairman, I would like to welcome the hon Minister back  to
Parliament. If I could just have her attention for just one moment.  I  want
to assure you that in your long periods of absence  from  Parliament  we  do
not think you are playing truant. We know you are  very  busy  dealing  with
the affairs of your Ministry and department.

During the past year, more than in any other  I  can  recall,  international
events have dominated South Africa's domestic agenda  and,  in  one  way  or
another, are impacting on the future of our country and our  people.  During
this  hectic  period  of  international  activity  the  personnel   of   the
department have worked under great pressure. They have achieved  their  main
goals in spite of the fact  that  some  of  the  problems  relating  to  the
corporate management of the department, which I identified  in  last  year's
budget debate, still persist. I believe  the  personnel  of  the  department
deserve our thanks.

This debate takes place against the  background  of  a  war  that  has  been
dramatised for many South Africans by the scenes which television brings  to
them as they relax in their homes in  the  evening.  I  want  to  express  a
personal word about war against the background of my experiences  as  a  19-
year-old South African in Italy, involved in the closing stages of the  last
world war.

There are occasions when countries or people are forced  to  take  up  arms.
There could always be noble causes to defend and there could even be such  a
thing as a just war, but let me say that there is nothing glorious or  noble
about war itself. War is ugly. It is brutal. It  is  savage.  War  demonises
opponents, it brutalises combatants,  it  dehumanises  the  humans  who  are
targets for killing and it traumatises innocent civilians. In  war,  success
depends on the ability to destroy and kill.

I fear for the generation of my children and grandchildren  if  we  of  this
generation should be conditioned to accept war  as  an  appropriate  way  of
settling  international  disputes.  War  has  unpredictable  and  unforeseen
consequences. Who would have predicted in 1945 that  little  more  than  one
generation after Germany's military power had been crushed,  its  industrial
infrastructure was destroyed and its cities flattened, Germany would  emerge
as the strongest  economy  in  Europe;  that  Japan,  beaten,  battered  and
bombed, would emerge a generation later as one of  the  strongest  economies
in the world; or that Great Britain, victorious in war,  in  less  than  one
generation would lose control of its mighty empire?

So too, the war on Iraq  is  bound  to  have  unpredictable  and  unforeseen
consequences. I ask if it will enhance the concept of democracy  around  the
world; will it help to usher in an era free from dictatorship; will it  help
to make the people and nations of our world more united; will it  strengthen
the global coalition against terrorism; and will it truly make the  world  a
safer place in which to live?

What will the impact be on the  United  Nations;  on  the  Middle  East;  on
Europe;  on  Nato  and  the  transatlantic  alliance;  on  Africa  and   the
developing world; on relationships between  the  South  and  North;  on  the
economy of the USA; and, may I ask, on the psyche of  the  American  people?
These are all imponderables today which, in due course, will be answered  by
the realities of tomorrow.

The events of the past 18 months have had a profound effect on the order  by
which international relations have been regulated. Firstly,  9/11  added  to
the existing multilateral organisations such as the  United  Nations,  which
are composed of nation-states, a new, discordant element of extrastatal  and
difficult to identify international terrorism, the activities of which  span
across nation-state boundaries in violation  of  the  interstate  agreements
through which our international order is regulated. It was a  new  component
of international affairs that we had to deal with.

Secondly, the attacks of 9/11 wounded the  United  States  of  America,  the
world's only superpower, thus resulting in the United States'  own  national
security, which so many Americans had taken for granted, being  promoted  to
the predominant objective of  American  foreign  policy.  Subsequently,  the
failure of the UN Security Council to deal effectively  with  the  issue  of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, combined with the  decision  of  the  US
and UK to make war on Iraq without the approval of the UN, has dealt a  blow
both to the role of the  UN  and  to  multilateralism  as  a  mechanism  for
regulating international relations.

Today, as a consequence, unless the nations of the world  are  simply  going
to accept that  international  relations  will  be  dominated  by  a  single
superpower whose government will decide unilaterally  if  and  when  war  is
appropriate, they will have to unite to rebuild the  UN  as  a  multilateral
body that is  capable  of  playing  an  effective  part  in  regulating  the
international order. While not closing  our  eyes  to  the  existence  of  a
superpower,  the  DA  believes  that  multilateralism  must  be  the   prime
mechanism for regulating international relations.

Where do we in South Africa start with the promotion of  multilateralism  in
the international field? The Government has been engaged in activities on  a
multilateral basis in various institutions and places around the world.  Yet
right here in Southern Africa, the region  in  which  it  has  the  greatest
interest, its approach to multilateralism and  its  use  of  multilateralism
has been, quite frankly, pathetic. And this in spite of the  fact  that  the
Government says that ``the pre-eminence of multilateralism'' is one  of  its
priorities. Let me give a couple of examples.

Instead of driving the multilateral  process  of  which  it  was  part,  the
Government undermined it. That was in the case  of  Zimbabwe.  South  Africa
was one of three countries which accepted the mandate to act  on  behalf  of
the multilateral Commonwealth. It was party to suspending Zimbabwe from  the
Commonwealth, subject  to  a  review  after  a  year  and  subject  to  it's
endeavouring to bring about reconciliation between Zanu-PF and the MDC.  But
before the year was up, before there was any substantial improvement in  the
Zimbabwean situation, and before they  made  any  serious  effort  to  bring
about political  reconciliation  in  Zimbabwe,  South  Africa  and  Nigeria,
accepting assurances given by Mugabe at face value, walked away  from  their
multilateral  mandate  and  unilaterally  declared  that   ``the   time   is
auspicious to lift the sanctions on Zimbabwe''.

When I think of the concerted effort South  Africa  made  to  try  to  bring
about political reconciliation in Burundi, and the time,  money  and  energy
South Africa has spent in trying to bring about political unity in the  DRC,
I am appalled at the lack of political will the Government has displayed  in
respect of  its  multilateral  mandate  to  try  to  bring  about  political
reconciliation in Zimbabwe. In the light  of  the  mandate  that  they  had,
based on the finding that the Zimbabwean election was  not  free  and  fair,
for our Government as an implementing party to say  that  in  order  to  let
negotiations take place the onus was not on Mugabe,  but  ``on  the  MDC  to
withdraw its petition to the courts'' simply boggles the mind. That  is  the
only redress they have, as an opposition party, namely through  the  courts.
No  wonder  millions  of  Zimbabweans  who  are  suffering  under   Mugabe's
oppressive rule feel that South Africa has let them down.

However, if South Africa has failed to uphold  multilateralism  through  the
Commonwealth, it has failed even more so in the SADC. SADC countries have  a
legal obligation to behave in a manner which conforms  with  the  principles
of the SADC. And yet, when pressed to  act  in  respect  of  the  Zimbabwean
government's  violations of the SADC Treaty, the  South  African  Government
says: ``No, we can't take action. It is for SADC to decide.'' And yet,  when
SADC has to decide, its Council, of which this Minister is a member,  evades
the Zimbabwe issue by declaring: ``Our position is that this is an  internal
matter and the SADC has no intention of interfering''.

And so the SA Government says it won't act because this is  a  matter  which
falls to the SADC, and through the SADC the SA Government says it won't  act
in this matter because it is an internal  matter.  Thus,  in  spite  of  its
commitment to multilateralism, to the objectives of the SADC,  to  the  SADC
as an institution for multilateral action, and in spite  of  the  harm  that
Mugabe's government is doing to the economy of the region,  this  Government
is taking no persuasive action in respect of the Zimbabwe situation.

I have often wondered why, and at last the Minister has come  out  with  the
answer. She said the other day: ``Condemnation of Zimbabwe? You  will  never
hear that. It is never going to happen as long as the ANC Government  is  in
power.'' That is the answer. [Interjections.] This is a far  cry  from  what
Mandela said,  namely  that  democracy  and  human  rights  were  ``regional
concerns''. He also said:


  How can we continue to give comfort to member states whose actions are so
  diametrically opposed to the values and principles for which we struggled
  so long?

Nevertheless the cosy, historical and sisterly relationship between  Zanu-PF
and the ANC is more important than the wellbeing of the people of  Zimbabwe,
more important than the interests of South Africa and  more  important  than
the legal commitments to the SADC Treaty.

And so the situation in Zimbabwe is getting worse, not better.
Last week, hundreds of supporters of the MDC were brutalised in their  homes
by uniformed members of the Zimbabwe military after Mugabe at  a  rally  had
said of the MDC: ``We shall not treat them  with  soft  gloves  any  more''.
Later on  Mugabe  warned:  ``The  MDC  will  be  consumed  by  fire''.  This
morning's media carry horrifying stories of arrests, beatings  and  tortures
at the hands of gangs, soldiers and police. The situation is getting out  of
hand and I want to know when the Minister is going to  speak  up  and  start
condemning the atrocities that are taking place. When is she going to  speak
out against the violations of human rights and the  rule  of  law  that  are
taking place? [Applause.] And the violation of the SADC Treaty itself?

The thuggery that was displayed this past week shows that the  situation  is
getting out of hand. [Interjections.] I quote from John  Battersley  on  his
return from Zimbabwe. He says:


  Zimbabwe is crying out, but we in South Africa are not listening.  Harare
  is reminiscent of the closing days of the apartheid era.

It is time the Minister woke up. [Applause.]
Mr M RAMGOBIN: Chairperson, Madam Minister, ladies and  gentlemen.  The  ANC
supports the budget for foreign affairs. [Interjections.] Of  course.  There
continue  to  be  amongst  us   people   pretentious,   flatulent   with   a
commercialised version of what I term "spiritual poise" ...  [Interjections]
... who forget that this poise  becomes  meaningless  when  they  refuse  to
shoulder the burden of a suffering humanity. The primary  objective  of  the
ANC-led South African Government, ... shut up ... is to initiate  programmes
and projects to make possible a better life for all citizens  by  generating
goods and services  with  productive  value  and  providing  a  climate  for
security.

Our  foreign  policy  objectives  are,  therefore,  essentially  an  outward
projection  of  our  country's  domestic  imperatives:  The   promotion   of
democracy and respect for human rights, the prevention of conflicts and  the
promotion of peaceful  resolutions  and  disputes  and  the  advancement  of
sustainable development and the alleviation of poverty.

With the strength of our Constitution and inspired by  the  history  of  the
ANC, our leadership roles in pursuance of our policy include  chairing  NAM,
the  Commonwealth  and  the  AU.  We  hosted  the  WSSD  and,  without   any
pretentious spiritual poise, promoted and are promoting peace and  stability
in Africa and elsewhere. Those of you  who  were  yesterday's  promoters  of
apartheid and  today's harbingers of doom must be yellow with envy when  you
see the ANC-led South Africa promoting the interests of  developing  nations
with regard to poverty reduction, debt relief  and  the  democratisation  of
international relations in high-level interaction with developed  countries.
[Applause.]

Given that tunnel vision of the opposition's view on the  hedonistic  nature
of the human condition, Mr Eglin, it is important for him  and  his  ilk  to
note that all these efforts by the ANC-led Government are to  ensure  peace,
security and stability.

The  pillars  of  the  AU,  which  you  will  not  understand,   Mr   former
imperialist, colonialist, are to be constituted by the promotion  of  peace,
security and stability on the continent.  Towards  this  objective,  the  AU
will be responsible for the peaceful resolution  of  conflict  among  member
states through means to be decided by the assembly  of  the  AU,  which  may
give directives to the executive council  on  the  management  of  conflict,
war, acts of terrorism, emergency situations and the restoration  of  peace.
[Interjections.]

Delegates at the Durban summit of the  AU,  in  recognition  of  the  socio,
economic and political problems, went beyond the scope of the  assembly  and
the executive council, and agreed on the organs responsible  for  peace  and
security and stability. Among these are a central organ of the mechanism  on
conflict prevention, management and  resolution  and  the  protocol  on  the
establishment of the Peace and Security Council, which will be the  standing
decision-making organ for  the  prevention,  management  and  resolution  of
conflict. This council will be supported by the commission, a panel  of  the
wise, a continental warning system, an African stand-by force and a  special
fund. These will  make  possible  a  common  African  defence  and  security
policy.

It will not be far-fetched to declare that it is  beyond  the  comprehension
of the DA as to why the Durban summit entrusted the responsibility to  South
Africa in the person of President Mbeki to establish a group of  experts  to
examine all aspects related to such a policy. But what  all  South  Africans
have to comprehend is the overwhelming fact, Mr Eglin, that  none  of  these
creative  interventions  will  be   meaningful   in   isolation   from   the
socioeconomic development and integration of the continent.

Hon Minister, in keeping with the directive given to your department by  the
ANC-led Government, you have reported to  us  that  the  cluster  priorities
strongly emphasise the advancement  of  peace,  stability  and  security  in
Africa, the Middle East and beyond, as well as fighting  terrorism.  In  not
wanting to repeat what you have said, I have got to say this:  For  decades,
Africa was a theatre of proxy wars. The extent  to  which  global  interests
and role-players, officially  or  unofficially,  sought  to  entrench  their
mercurial interests with the connivance of local  leaders  reflects  on  the
natural resources of our continent. The spectrum of  our  resources  ranging
from oil and copper, diamonds  and  gold,  cocoa  and  cattle,  uranium  and
asbestos, tin, steel and aluminium, almost  all  the  ingredients  necessary
for our own sustainable  development  and  self-sufficiency,  have  in  fact
contributed to the development and sufficiency  of  our  former  colonisers.
And what is worse today is the existence of disorder with the connivance  of
greedy local leaders.

It is this disorder that compels  us  in  South  Africa  to  take  proactive
action such as the Inter-Congolese dialogue, the South  Africa-Angola  joint
commission for co-operation, the Arusha peace and  reconciliation  agreement
in respect of Burundi, the resourcing of South African expertise in  seeking
to resolve the problems in Sudan and several others. We are seized with  the
need to confront this disorder which  is  compounded  by  ethnic  conflicts,
dealing in conflict diamonds and violence  and  war  as  the  new  political
instrument  of  economic  control  with  the  use  of  mercenaries   -   the
unconventional military syndicates.

With regard to  Southern  Africa's  security  architecture,  we  are  facing
immediate challenges and prospects. The Minister has said this  but  I  will
repeat it. SADC is the chief  multilateral  organ  to  co-ordinate  regional
economic  and  political  integration  and  also  peace  and  security.  Our
involvement  in  developing  a  coherent  security  architecture  to  manage
conflicts  in  Angola,  Zimbabwe,  the  DRC,  Lesotho   and   Swaziland   is
indispensable. With the concurrence of all member states and the  initiative
of our Government, the issues of Zimbabwe, Mr Eglin, are  being  dealt  with
in a constructive manner to assist all  Zimbabweans.  Our  attempts  through
dialogue in the  interests  of  the  region  lend  to  the  creation  of  an
environment conducive to reconciliation.

It is my pride and honour, given the background that  I  come  from,  to  be
fortunate to participate in the historical processes that  place  Africa  at
the  apex  of  the  global  agenda.  We  are  engaged  in  a  people-centred
advancement of sustainable development based on  democratic  values  towards
peace, security and stability.  In  recognition  of  the  abundance  of  our
continent's natural resources we need all Africans to be  agents  of  change
in order that, through a common platform, we do  not  only  have  a  dynamic
partnership  but  also  the  responsibility  to  engage  the  rest  of   the
international community. I wish I could swear.

Notwithstanding the arrogant glibness of the DA  and  the  backgrounds  that
they hail from, I ask them to  share  this  pride  and  honour  that  Africa
affords us. Each one of us in this House, in one way or another, has  to  be
troubled. For a while we may carry on and give  place  to  others  and  they
will have to carry the burdens of their times. The question we have  to  ask
ourselves is: How did we play our part when we were here? I  am  sure  those
succeeding us will judge us. In the ANC we do judge and measure  success  or
failure in what we have done and do. We in the ANC did make mistakes; we  do
make mistakes, and because we engage in action, we may make  mistakes.  But,
in spite of these political morons, blessed were  we.  We  saved  ourselves,
and will continue to do so,  from  an  inner  shame  and  cowardice.  It  is
especially in this context  that  I  wish  to  relate  peace,  security  and
stability in relationship to revenge and terrorism.

The history of the ANC is  an  urge,  in  essence,  rooted  in  the  African
Renaissance. If I have an urge to say something  very  unkindly  to  you,  I
shall do it outside. [Interjections.] I shall use you as a pillar and do  to
you what little dogs do to you. [Interjections.] Because you are. It  is  an
urge commanding us that we must so live as not to be seared with  the  shame
of apartheid, the cowardice, prejudices and trivialities  of  the  years  of
apartheid and colonialism. As South Africans living  in  a  global  village,
the ANC invites all so that we may not be tortured for the  years  ahead  of
us, because we have lived without a purpose, that our first and  pre-eminent
cause is the liberation of all, you and me.

How else do you construct the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission?  What
meaning do you give to a Government of National Unity? How and why  did  the
ANC present the gift of a hymn, Nkosi  Sikelel'iAfrika?  In  the  spirit  of
honesty, none here or  elsewhere  can  deny  that  these  are  efforts  with
reverence for life  without  a  vindictive  spirit,  without  reprisals,  to
secure peace, security and stability in our country for all who live in  it,
black and white.

On the question of terrorism there is  no  dispute,  at  least  in  the  ANC
policy position, that the dynamics of both  fundamentalist  terror  and  its
relation  between  religion  and  the  state  impacts  negatively   on   the
democratisation process, which is the cornerstone for  peace,  security  and
stability. Terrorists, indeed, create a state  of  fear  in  their  victims.
They are ruthless and do not conform to humanitarian norms.  This  abhorrent
means of pursuing social, religious, political  or  economic  ends  is  best
described by our President when he says, amongst other things, that:


  Whatever their cause, those responsible for these mass murders in  Kenya,
  Tanzania and the Twin  Towers,  have  demeaned  their  cause  and  placed
  themselves in a position in which they cannot be accepted as  people  who
  should be treated as genuine representatives of a just cause.  Regardless
  of that cause and its future outcome, it can never be said that  the  end
  they pursue justifies the means they have used.

He goes on again, reflecting on the history of the ANC:


  This is in keeping with the long-established tradition  of  our  movement
  and people. As this movement, we inherited a particular morality  of  the
  masses for whose liberation from white minority rule the ANC was  formed.
  Our people have always behaved  in  a  manner  that  respected  life  and
  celebrated human diversity, the Bahá'i movement.


  When our movement decided to take up arms for the defeat of the apartheid
  system, the decision was taken that all efforts should be made  to  avoid
  the loss of human lives. Even as our enemy and its friends denounced  our
  movement as terrorist, we took strict measures to avoid the use of terror
  against the people. We were opposed  to  any  attack  on  so-called  soft
  targets. On the contrary,  our  enemy  did  not  hesitate  to  resort  to
  terrorism to defeat our struggle. Our movement insisted that to resort to
  terrorism would be to dishonour our struggle and to destroy its morality.
  We condemned the use of the "necklace" as a barbaric form of struggle.

The President goes on to say that:


  Despite the unquestionable justice of our cause and despite the  nobility
  of the end we sought, we remained steadfast in our  conviction  that  not
  all means were permissible to bring about this result.

This history is the humble contribution of the ANC to the reconstruction  of
human society. To ensure that the human  race  remains  the  beneficiary  of
peace, security and stability, we are also saying that humans  must  be  the
instruments to secure peace, security and stability. This is the  anchor  of
our foreign policy, given the history  of  wars,  hunger,  disease,  racism,
religious bigotry and so on. Humans did initiate programmes and projects  to
establish a world order based on peace, security and stability, like the  UN
with its different organs.

Whilst our Government engages the international community on  the  basis  of
rational persuasion on the moral authority of our own Constitution  and  the
Charter of the UN, we unreservedly view with disgust the odious invasion  of
Iraq. The bellicose and merciless aggression of  the  US  and  the  UK,  the
powers who helped create the UN, their blatant disregard  for  international
law underpinned by their equally blatant avarice and  greed  is  reminiscent
of their cupidity when they aided and abetted also  not  only  the  Mabutus,
Savimbis and the Tshombes of Africa, but the Bin Ladens, Sharons and  Saddam
Hussein himself.

While I support the budget for Foreign Affairs, I do have  grave  misgivings
about whether it is adequate when our country is  being  propelled  to  take
proactive measures to ensure  the  peace,  security  and  stability  of  our
global village. [Applause.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Hon Chairperson, the speech by Mr Ramgobin was  indeed
filled with arrogance and threats towards the opposition. I  think  it  will
be described as a flatulent one. [Laughter.] The best part  of  that  speech
was the end when he shut up.

On behalf of the IFP, I wish  to  associate  ourselves  with  the  words  of
appreciation expressed by previous speakers in respect of the hon  Minister,
the hon  Deputy  Minister,  Mr  Askies  Pahad,  and  the  officials  of  the
department, and the chairperson, Dr Jordan and others.  [Interjections.]  We
support the budget.

As far as international politics are concerned, ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Van der Merwe, can you give Mr Jordan  an
opportunity? I think he has a point of order.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Is it parliamentary for Mr Van  der  Merwe  to  make  fun  of
another hon member's name? It is not the first time this hon member  behaves
in this manner. I consider it racist. The man's name  is  Abdul  Aziz.  It's
not Askies, and  he  knows  it.  I  ask  for  your  ruling  on  the  matter.
[Interjections.]

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Hon Chairperson, that point  of  order  is  utter  and
absolute balderdash and  nonsense.  [Interjections.]  That  hon  member  has
racism on his brain. Whenever he sees anything, it's racism.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, order! Hon Van der  Merwe,  the  Chair
is behind you and will rule accordingly.
Please refer to hon members as ``hon'' and by their correct names.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Hon Chairperson, I have read in  the  newspapers  that
the hon Deputy Minister is called Mr Askies Pahad. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, will you please correct that?

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: Aziz, then. Mr Aziz Pahad.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please, Mr Van der Merwe, will you  refer  to
the ...

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: The hon Askies, ahem, Aziz Pahad. [Laughter.]

As far as international politics are concerned, we  are  today  experiencing
very dramatic and fundamental changes. The Minister  also  referred  to  it,
saying that the world is at a crucial crossroads.

In fact, the Iraqi war has unbelievable implications for  the  international
political  order,  and  also  for  the  future  relations  between   states.
Therefore, the  IFP  believes  that  South  Africa  should  carefully  watch
developments and remember the golden rule, namely, to put South  Africa  and
the interests of our people first.

The obvious serious implication of the war is the huge setback  suffered  by
the United Nations, to which Mr Eglin has also  referred.  The  simple  fact
for all to observe is that the UN, as an organisation, has  failed.  It  has
failed in its most fundamental and  historic  mission,  namely,  to  prevent
war. The UN failed to enforce its own resolutions passed after the Gulf  War
in 1991. The UN failed to take  decisive  action  against  President  Saddam
Hussein when he  ignored  disarmament  resolutions.  The  UN  has  become  a
showroom of division instead of unity.

The question is: What is to become of the  UN?  This  is  one  of  the  very
interesting questions that can  only  be  answered  in  the  time  to  come.
[Interjections.] But, in view of its apparent  failure,  one  could  rightly
ask whether the UN is travelling the same  death  route  as  the  League  of
Nations did after the First World War. Are  there  plans  for  a  new  world
body? Time will tell.

If the UN is to continue as an organisation, one  can  rightfully  ask  what
reforms are to be introduced. Surely the UN can no longer  be  tolerated  as
an  extremely  expensive  talkshop  or  a  forum  where  national  interests
override international interests and where wars cannot be prevented?

Serious back-to-the-drawing-board action is needed for the UN.  We  have  to
take a relook at the UN's composition and its  functions.  Also,  the  role,
function and composition of the Security Council and the veto  system  needs
to be revisited.

The IFP believes that South Africa should be proactive in the future  reform
of the UN with creative  inputs  and  with  workable  solutions  so  that  a
powerful world organisation could be created that  can  effectively  prevent
war and secure world peace.

In defence of the UN, one must rightly refer to  the  sterling  humanitarian
work for decades ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order,  hon  member,  there  is  a  point  of
order.

Hon Gogotya, you are rising on a point of order?

Mr N J GOGOTYA: On a point of order, Chairperson. Is the hon member  Mr  Van
der Merwe able to shed some light on the  rumour  that  President  George  W
Bush is being advised by  the  hon  Mtshali  to  take  up  weapons  of  war?
[Interjections.] Can he substantiate that?

There is a rumour that George W Bush is being advised by Premier Mtshali  to
take ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Gogotya.

Mr N J GOGOTYA: Can he shed some light on that? [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Gogotya, you said you were  rising
on a point of order. You were supposed to ask the Chair if you could pose  a
question. You did not do so. I am  going  to  allow  Mr  Van  der  Merwe  to
continue.

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: As far as I know, President Bush  phoned  Mr  Mtshali,
and he congratulated him on the excellent way in which he is  governing  the
province of KwaZulu-Natal! [Interjections.]

In defence of the UN, one must rightly refer to  the  sterling  humanitarian
work for decades,  dealing  with  diseases,  natural  disasters,  ignorance,
racism, illiteracy, refugees and so forth. However, in  its  most  important
mission, namely to prevent war, the UN failed dismally.

The same failure applies to regional bodies, and the question that  we  have
to pose is whether the regional bodies that we have are not going  the  same
route.

The IFP believes that the next extremely serious implication of the  war  is
the ghastly effects on innocent people - effects that will soon surface  for
all to observe; effects that are unfortunately the normal  results  of  war.
Therefore, great humanitarian  challenges  will  soon  face  the  world.  We
believe that if one is sensitive to the humanitarian challenges ahead,  that
does not mean that one takes sides. In offering a  helping  hand,  one  does
not say the Americans were right or wrong, neither does  one  say  that  the
Iraqis were right or wrong. When after the  war,  which  is  hopefully  very
soon, we are confronted with the awful suffering, the loss of lives and  the
destruction of infrastructure, we only see  hungry  people,  we  see  people
without roofs over their heads, and we see that there  is  no  medicine,  no
food and no blankets. One does not see or  care  whether  these  people  are
Iraqis or Americans. They are human beings in suffering.

Therefore, the IFP pleads, even at this early stage, for South Africa to  be
in the frontlines to assist with humanitarian aid, to  devise  and  have  an
effective contingency plan in place well ahead of time so that South  Africa
can lend a helping hand to those in suffering, no matter on which side  they
fought in the war.

South Africa's own role in the after-war era must also timeously come  under
scrutiny. In the pre-1994 South  Africa,  we  leaned  over  to  the  Western
countries, and stood by the USA and others. We  were  not  on  good  footing
with the Gaddafis, the Yasser Arafats and the  Saddam  Husseins,  but  after
1994, the scenario changed. We are now closer to the Gaddafis,  the  Arafats
and the Husseins, and we appear to be moving  away  from  the  USA  and  its
allies. What will our position be in the future?

In conclusion, I want to say that if you think about the  awful  effects  of
post-war Iraq, you shudder to think of some possible  after  effects;  would
terrorism once again raise its ugly head?  Is  religious  fundamentalism  to
become a critical factor in future? [Interjections.] Are we entering an  era
of nuclear proliferation? Is international crime to become a greater  danger
than it is presently in  the  form  of  drug  and  human  trafficking,  arms
smuggling and money laundering? [Interjections.] Why don't you  ask  for  an
opportunity to speak? You know, it happens so often that  people  sit  there
and  are  never  trusted  by  their  Whips   to   come   and   stand   here.
[Interjections.] They just sit there and shout and  shout.  The  reason  why
you shout is that you are too stupid  to  come  and  stand  here  and  talk.
[Interjections.]

What we should do, to be serious for a moment, is  realise  that  the  Iraqi
war is an extremely serious thing, and that the after effects  of  that  war
will affect all of us. What we should do as a nation is that we should  pray
for our leaders. We should pray for the hon  Minister  and  the  hon  Deputy
Minister and the department. We should also pray for the  Government  to  do
the right things in the interests of South Africa and its  people.  We  wish
you well, Madam Minister. [Interjections.]

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Chairperson, the hon Koos van der Merwe referred  to  the
possible failure of the UN and I will come back to that point in my speech.

Our diplomats are doing an excellent job in marketing  South  Africa  abroad
and we thank them for a job well done. [Applause.]  Allow  me  to  recognise
our Ambassador to Algeria in the benches behind me, Mr Mo Shaik.

Ons is altwee kaalkop en die hare het behoorlik gewaai toe  ons  mekaar  die
eerste keer by Codesa ontmoet het en gestry het oor die beveiliging van  die
World Trade Centre. [We are both bald-headed, and  the  sparks  were  really
flying when we first met at Codesa and argued  about  the  security  of  the
World Trade Centre.]

Although understaffed and overworked, there are currently 856  vacancies  at
head office, which is totally unacceptable,  because  our  staff  there  are
also doing outstanding work. They should especially be commended  for  their
part in the successful organisation of international conferences  for  which
South Africa has become a popular venue.

The acting Director-General excels in his  post  and  deserves  a  permanent
appointment. It is an honour to serve on a  committee  chaired  by  the  hon
Pallo Jordan. He acts totally unbiased and always brings  a  fresh,  if  not
sometimes controversial, angle to the  debate.  The  hon  Deputy  Minister's
regular interaction with the committee as well as his balanced  approach  to
sensitive international issues are highly appreciated. [Applause.]

We have a no-nonsense Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is tipped in  certain
circles to become a future president of South Africa.  [Interjections.]  Two
good things will emanate from such a possibility.  Firstly,  it  will  force
Winnie Mandela into exile because she will  no  longer  be  entitled  to  be
called "the Mother of the Nation", that is, of course, if she survives as  a
human shield in Baghdad! [Laughter.] Secondly, it  will  send  shivers  down
the spine of those African leaders who must yet come to terms with the  idea
of including women in their delegation to the  African  Parliament.  Brother
Leader is a case in point. [Laughter.]

The R2 billion allocated to Foreign Affairs is hardly  enough  to  keep  the
department operational. Foreign  Affairs  is  the  only  department  besides
Revenue Services which actually generates  income  by  facilitating  foreign
investment and should therefore get a bigger slice of the cake. The post  of
Director-General is now vacant for nearly two  years  and,  Chairperson,  it
cannot go on like this. The hon Minister owes an explanation  to  the  House
as to why the post of Director-General has not been filled.

Voorsitter, ek wil 'n  ander  sensitiewe  kwessie  opper,  naamlik  dié  van
regstellende aksie in die departement. Die Nuwe  NP  se  standpunt  van  die
begin   af   was   dat   die   Departement   van   Buitelandse   Sake    die
bevolkingsamestelling van Suid-Afrika moet  weerspieël.  Regstellende  aksie
was gevolglik onvermydelik en dit was goed  dat  dit  plaasgevind  het.  Met
buitelandse poste as voorbeeld kan daar ook nog steeds  met  reg  geredeneer
word dat die proses van regstellende aksie nog nie voltooi is nie.  Daar  is
880 swartmense, 77 Asiërs, 78 bruinmense,  in  totaal  1035  in  buitelandse
poste, teenoor 622 witmense. In  verhouding  tot  die  bevolkingsamestelling
lyk dit my nog steeds asof daar nog te veel witmense  in  buitelandse  poste
is. Die Nuwe NP  het  van  die  begin  af  gesê  die  beste  manier  om  die
getalsverhouding reg te kry, is deur die toelatingsproses en  deur  die  vul
van vakante poste. Dit sou voorkom dat daar  nou  gediskrimineer  word  teen
witmense wat tans in diens van  die  departement  is.  Baie  van  hulle  bly
vassteek op een posvlak en word ten spyte van hulle ervaring  en  kundigheid
nie eers genooi vir onderhoude vir bevorderingsposte  nie.  Al  wat  hierdie
mense wat tans werksaam is in die departement vra, is om 'n  kans  gegun  te
word om op meriete hulle land te dien. Geen departement kan dit bekostig  om
gedemotiveerde mense op sy balansstaat te hê nie en hopelik  sal  mense  wat
tans in die departement dien 'n gelyke kans gegun word  vir  bevordering  en
oorsese plasings.  (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, I want to  raise  another  sensitive  issue,  namely  that  of
affirmative action in the department. From the very outset the  position  of
the New NP has been that the Department of Foreign  Affairs  should  reflect
the  composition  of  the  population   of   South   Africa.   Consequently,
affirmative action  has  been  inevitable,  and  it  is  good  that  it  has
happened. With foreign posts as an example it  can  also  still  rightly  be
argued that the process of affirmative action has not  yet  been  completed.
There are 880 blacks, 77 Indians and 78 coloureds  -  in  total  1035  -  in
foreign posts, compared to 622 whites. In relation  to  the  composition  of
the population it appears to me as if there are still  too  many  whites  in
foreign posts. The New NP has said from the beginning that the best  way  to
sort out the numbers proportionally is through  the  admission  process  and
the filling of vacant posts. It would appear that whites currently  employed
by the department are now being discriminated against. Many of  them  remain
stuck at one post level and, despite their experience  and  expertise,  they
are not even invited to interviews  for  promotion  posts.  All  that  these
people, who currently work in the department, are asking for is to be  given
a chance to serve their country on merit. No department can afford  to  have
people who are demotivated on its balance sheet, and  hopefully  people  who
are currently serving in the department will be given  an  equal  chance  at
promotion and overseas placements.]

Chairperson, it seems as if the Zimbabwean  issue  will  haunt  us  forever,
although for the first time it seems as if there is light at the end of  the
tunnel. Despite the fact that the hon Minister of Foreign  Affairs  declared
that South Africa would never criticise  Zimbabwe,  the  hon  President  did
just that. He criticised Zimbabwe in no uncertain terms. He openly said  the
land reform programme  in  Zimbabwe  was  conducted  in  the  wrong  manner.
President Mbeki's criticism of the land  reform  programme  in  Zimbabwe  is
good news for Nepad. The Nepad process was in danger  of  becoming  derailed
because African leaders, with their refusal to  criticise  fellow  heads  of
state,  created  a  perception  that  they  were  not  really  committed  to
democratic principles and sound government.

President Mbeki's criticism of Mugabe will restore confidence in  the  Nepad
programme and will, for the very first time, put real pressure on Mugabe  to
reform. Until now, President Mugabe has  dismissed  criticism  from  Western
countries as a  colonial  plot  against  him.  Criticism,  however,  from  a
prominent African leader cannot be simply swept under the carpet.

In a letter to the New NP last year, the hon  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs
indicated that  a  bilateral  agreement  on  the  protection  of  investment
between South Africa and Zimbabwe will be considered. This was confirmed  by
the hon President when he replied to a question by the New NP in  his  state
of the nation address. It would be appreciated if  the  hon  Minister  could
indicate to the House whether any progress in this  regard  has  been  made,
especially in the light of the fact that South Africa and Angola  have  just
signed a protocol on investment protection.

The war against Iraq is in full swing. Allow me to deal  with  some  of  the
arguments raised and statements made during the three  debates  on  Iraq  we
have had in the House thus far. The hon President went out  of  his  way  to
say South Africa is not anti-America, yet certain statements and actions  by
the ANC as well as the Government sent out messages to the contrary.

The Secretary-General of the ANC said South Africa  could  become  the  next
target of the US due to its vast mineral resources.  The  fact  that  nobody
repudiated him could be interpreted as being  anti-American.  The  notorious
letter handed over to Saddam Hussein by the hon  Deputy  Minister  in  which
Saddam Hussein  was  allegedly  encouraged  to  stand  firm  could  also  be
interpreted as being anti-American.

When the New NP urged the Government not to come out on the side  of  Saddam
Hussein due  to  economic  and  trade  considerations  but  rather  to  stay
neutral, the hon President slated  this  position  as  highly  unprincipled.
This could also be interpreted as being anti-American.

I am not pleading that we should openly side with the  US.  Their  wars  are
not necessarily our wars.  I  am  pleading  that  we  should  stay  neutral,
because it is in our national interest to do so. We  should  however  render
humanitarian aid to the people  of  Iraq  and  if  possible  we  should  get
involved in rebuilding Iraq after the war.

The hon Minister of Finance said South Africa  is  not  pro-Saddam  Hussein;
South Africa is  pro-multilateralism.  Of  course,  multilateralism  is  the
correct way to go, but unfortunately, multilateralism  is  going  to  become
one of the first casualties of this war. Failure to establish  consensus  on
the Iraq issue will force the USA, the only superpower left,  to  circumvent
the UN in future, relating to all issues of safety and security. Lack of  US
support before World War  II  was  one  of  the  reasons  for  the  ultimate
disbanding of the League of Nations and the writing may be on the  wall  for
the UN for that very same reason.
To talk about unilateral attack by the USA also does not quite  hold  water.
The so-called "Coalition of the Willing" consists of  40  nations  that  are
actively supporting the USA in its war effort. The USA is, in  other  words,
not acting entirely on its own.

In conclusion, regime change should not be  the  goal  of  any  war.  Regime
change is the responsibility of the people of a country themselves.  Eastern
Europe, and especially Eastern Germany, serves as a good example.  Communist
regimes were thrown out of the window when millions of  people  simply  took
to the streets,  and  this  is  what  should  happen  in  Iraq.  The  people
themselves should get rid of the tyrant, however difficult that may be.

The protest marches in the streets of Harare indicate  that  the  people  of
Zimbabwe are also finally prepared to take on the responsibility  of  regime
change and it is obvious that Mugabe's days are numbered.

Hopefully the war in Iraq will end soon, with as few civilian casualties  as
possible, and hopefully the US will not make the same  mistake  the  British
made during the Anglo-Boer War. They thought the war would  be  over  within
weeks. Instead, it lasted for three years. Hopefully the  war  against  Iraq
will not also derail the global coalition against terrorism because, in  the
final analysis, Osama Bin Laden poses a bigger threat to  world  peace  than
Saddam Hussein could ever manage.

The New NP supports the Budget Vote.

Miss M N MAGAZI: Chairperson, the African  National  Congress  supports  the
budget and calls upon all like-minded South Africans to do the same.

Today we are debating the Department of Foreign Affairs' Budget  Vote  in  a
situation where two countries who are founder members of the United  Nations
Security Council have decided  unilaterally  to  attack  Iraq,  disregarding
efforts of the UN  Security  Council  to  seek  peaceful  solutions  to  the
crisis.

Our  foreign  policy  since  1994  has  been  underpinned  by  the   African
Renaissance through  the  African  Union  and  its  programme  for  Africa's
development, namely the New  Partnership  for  Africa's  Development.  These
policy  guidelines  are   commitment   to   global   equity,   justice   and
international law in the conduct of international  relations;  promotion  of
human rights and democracy; promotion of international peace,  security  and
stability through the United Nations  as  the  pre-eminent  global  security
body, the Non-Aligned Movement, the  African  Union,  the  Southern  African
Development Community and the Commonwealth.

Since the ANC Government was voted into power, we have been  called  to  act
and help people affected by conflict to find  peaceful  solutions  to  their
problems. We have  hosted  Palestinians  and  Israelis  to  help  them  find
solutions to their problem. Over the last four years, we  have  been  seized
with efforts to find peaceful resolutions  to  the  problems  of  the  Great
Lakes region, especially those of  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo  and
Burundi.  The  resolution  of  the  conflict  in  Angola  is  another  great
achievement for the Africans.

Our effort to help the people of Iraq to comply with the resolution  of  the
United Nations Security Council is known, as are all other  efforts  to  put
the agenda of the countries of the South on the agenda of  the  multilateral
institutions.
Over  the  last  three  years,  we  have  hosted  at   least   three   major
international events. The first was the  World  Conference  Against  Racism,
Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia  and  Related  Intolerance  in  2001.  The
second was the World Summit on Sustainable Development which  we  hosted  in
2002 in Johannesburg. The third and last one was the ICC Cricket World  Cup.
The level of success of these three events has  enhanced  our  international
standing, and this comes with much heavier international responsibilities.

We have noted with great enthusiasm the increment the Department of  Foreign
Affairs has received in the current financial year. The  increment  is  from
R2, 079 billion in the year 2002-03 to R2,243 billion for the year  2003-04.
This has indicated growth in the budget, however insufficient it may be.  It
is insufficient because of the nature of our work,  ie  working  in  foreign
countries most of the time, where the currency fluctuation  affects  us  all
the time.

Over the last nine years, we have opened more missions in foreign  countries
than any other government in the history of this country. In  the  next  few
months,  we  will  be  opening  six  new  missions.  This  will  mean  added
responsibilities. Therefore, this places upon us a task to  ensure  that  we
have an effectively and efficiently run Department  of  Foreign  Affairs.  I
must take this opportunity to thank the staff of  the  Department  who  have
defied the odds and made it a point to ensure that the image of our  country
is not tainted and has remained intact. [Applause.] This has been  happening
despite the fact that, over the last  year,  no  director-general  has  been
appointed yet. I, therefore, make  a  special  plea  to  the  hon  Minister,
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, in her busy schedule to  pay  special  attention  to
the appointment of a director-general and  other  senior  officials  in  the
department.

Another important issue is the appointment of ambassadors in all areas  that
are vacant. I am raising this point as a concern in that in  some  strategic
areas in the world we do not have a senior political  representative.  I  am
making a special plea to  the  Minister  to  give  this  matter  the  urgent
attention it deserves.

The issue of gender equality is at the  centre  of  our  reconstruction  and
development. It is not a by-the-way issue that we  thought  about  overnight
and decided on in the morning. It has been part of  our  thinking  from  the
inception of the ANC in 1912. Over the  years,  women  have  played  a  very
significant role. When you think of the role of women, names like  Charlotte
Maxeke, Lillian Ngoyi, Ellen Khuzwayo, Albertina Sisulu, Gertrude Shope,  to
mention but a few, come to mind.

I raise this issue not because I am a woman, but because it  is  the  stated
objective of this Government to affirm women in all areas of their lives.  I
also  raise  this  issue  because,  in  the  last  budget  briefing  by  the
Department of Foreign  Affairs,  the  officials  who  came  down  could  not
provide us as members of this portfolio  committee  with  relevant  figures.
The number of women who are in senior positions  in  the  department  leaves
much to be desired. It is our belief as the ANC that we should  enhance  the
role of women in all areas of our lives. I believe that  if  women  were  in
positions of responsibility, we would not have war in Iraq today.

The restructuring  of  the  Foreign  Services  Institute  is  critical.  The
restructuring of that institute cannot be  emphasised  enough.  We  need  to
recruit the best young men  and  women  to  go  and  serve  in  our  foreign
missions. Our foreign missions  must  reflect  the  gender  composition  and
demographics of our  country.  We  will  continue  to  support  the  efforts
undertaken by the department to transform that institute to be  better  able
to meet the challenges or to produce cadres  who  will  be  better  able  to
market our country abroad.

We, as the ANC, support the budget and therefore  we  call  upon  all  like-
minded South Africans to support it. [Applause.]]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Mr Chairperson, hon members, we have noted the  roughly  10%
annual increase in the budget estimates for 2003-04,  2004-05  and  2005-06.
Indeed we believe that the department needs much more than that.

It is common knowledge and understandable that the  reintegration  of  South
Africa into the global community has placed the country in a new  and  wider
world order, with equally challenging  relationships  and  responsibilities.
The Department of Foreign Affairs, together with  the  Presidency,  hit  the
ground running when, in the early formative years of our freedom, they  were
plunged into the centre of conflict  resolution  in  the  DRC  and  Burundi,
whose wars involved some SADC states and therefore impacted directly on  the
stability of the region. These conflicts have  had  dire  social,  political
and  economic  consequences  for  the  region.  The  imperatives  of  peace,
regional stability and sustainable development of Southern  Africa  and  the
continent as a  whole  have  thrown  South  Africa  into  the  deep  end  by
positioning her as a key player in  the  struggle  for  the  realisation  of
these objectives.

One of the key national objectives entrusted to the  Department  of  Foreign
Affairs is to promote the sustainable, social and  economic  development  of
South Africa. Regional  interdependence  in  a  globalising  world  economic
order inextricably links the development of our national economy to that  of
the Southern African region as a whole. This region  can  best  promote  its
collective interest through co-operation with other regions on  the  African
continent. This is the sine qua non for the development of a viable  African
economic bloc with any  chance  of  extracting  economic  advantage  in  its
dealings with the developed First World of the North.

In this crucial era of  international  relations,  when  one  superpower  is
embarking on  a  new  brand  of  aggressive  imperialism,  reinforced  by  a
staggering advance in technology, overwhelming superiority  in  all  weapons
of mass destruction and  military  capability,  the  development  of  viable
economic blocs among the communities of  the  developing  world  has  become
very urgent. This is the only way to ensure  that  multilateralism  survives
as a principle and a route to take in conflict  resolution.  The  UN  as  an
institution that was  established  to  maintain  world  peace  is  seriously
undermined by the current war which  is  being  waged  by  the  US  and  its
satellites in defiance of UN resolutions and world public opinion.

It is clear therefore that the Department of Foreign Affairs  has  to  steel
itself  and  be  empowered  to  play  a  crucial   role   in   strengthening
international peace initiatives. After  Iraq,  no  country,  no  region,  no
continent  can  sleep  in  peace  and  be  secure  in  its  sovereignty  and
integrity.

It is important  to  acknowledge  that  the  African  Union  and  its  Nepad
programme  cannot  take  the  partnership  with  the  G8  for  granted.  The
priorities of the North are predicated on  self-interest  and  therefore  do
not always coincide with our own. It is becoming increasingly  evident  that
Africa must think and  act  creatively.  We  have  vast  resources  on  this
continent still  lying  dormant,  untapped.  With  insight,  hard  work  and
resolution, using available global technology and know-how,  on  our  terms,
we can wake this sleeping giant and be a force to be reckoned with.

In order to succeed, we must indulge  in  self-criticism,  open  and  honest
discourse and mutual appraisal of our strengths and weaknesses.  Pan-African
solidarity should not preclude objective  criticism  of  one  another.  This
constructive evaluation of our policies, strategies and  practices,  however
uncomfortable it may be, is the essence of  the  peer  review  mechanism  in
Nepad. The Department of Foreign  Affairs  has  a  responsibility  to  urge,
persuade and engage in every way possible African  governments  and  members
of the non-aligned developing world to promote and nurture  good  governance
based on democratic principles in  political  institutions  which  would  be
shaped in accordance with the peculiar social and cultural circumstances  of
their environment. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Adv Z L MADASA: Chairperson, the Department of Foreign  Affairs  is  in  the
forefront to ensure  the  success  of  the  African  Union  and  Nepad.  The
department has to co-ordinate all the activities of the African  Union  from
the South African perspective. Capacity in  terms  of  human  resources  and
finance is still  a  big  challenge.  The  nonfilling  of  the  position  of
permanent director-general and other  positions  does  not  help  the  Nepad
cause either.

Although we welcome the President's announcement of a budget for  the  Nepad
programme, clearly more resources are needed. It goes without  saying  that,
in view of the Iraq war, it is unlikely  that  external  resources  will  be
forthcoming for African development. The coming G8 meeting,  though  chaired
by France, will in all likelihood not  result  in  tangible  results  beyond
pledges of support. The European economy is in dire straits,  the  US  needs
more funds for the war, and the global economic picture looks gloomy.

African leaders, therefore, are going to have to rethink their  strategy  of
funding the development of the continent. We have to look  no  further  than
ourselves. We must start at the beginning and patiently  work  on  unity  in
respect of ideological differences. We must be united by  one  goal  only  -
the socioeconomic development of our people. If you adopt  an  all-inclusive
approach at a political level, then we will build confidence among  all  the
states, big and small. Once  united,  Africa  will  be  able,  together,  to
devise and agree on common economic policies at the  national  and  regional
level that will eventually ensure the development of  the  whole  continent.
We will all be able to underwrite the common principles of  democracy,  good
governance and human rights in a meaningful manner, not just on paper.

It is in this regard that the  new  endeavours  by  the  President  to  sign
bilateral agreements with the states in the SADC is to be welcomed. We  have
to build the African Union step by step and very  patiently.  The  so-called
strategy of building alliances among the progressive forces will  not  work.
What is needed is the promotion of  an  all-inclusive  democracy  throughout
the continent, as evidenced in the DRC and Ivory Coast resolutions of war.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  Chairperson,  Minister  Zuma  said,
and I quote:


  Seeking a better world for all must mean the rescue of the  poor  of  our
  world  and  the  globally   marginalised   from   despair,   misery   and
  impoverishment and the restoration of peace.

For us in Africa the reality is that  nearly  half  the  world's  population
still has to make do on less than  two  dollars  a  day.  Approximately  1,2
billion people - 500 million in South Asia  and  300  million  in  Africa  -
struggle on less than one dollar a day. Indeed, people who live  in  Africa,
south of the Sahara, are almost as poor today as they  were  20  years  ago.
Africa's share of the world's absolute poor increased from  25%  to  30%  in
the 1990s.

According to a New York council of foreign affairs task  force,  the  assets
of three top billionaires are more than the combined GDP of all  the  least-
developed countries and their 600 million people. According to the  1999  UN
Human Development Report, more than 80 countries  have  per  capita  incomes
that are lower than they were a decade or more ago. A  recent  transnational
communications takeover in the United States created a company whose  market
value exceeds the GDP of nearly half of all UN members, though  it  is  only
the world's fourth richest company.

In recognition of this sad reality, the recent NAM summit  declared,  and  I
quote:


  With increased  globalisation  and  the  rapid  advance  of  science  and
  technology, the world has changed dramatically.  The  rich  and  powerful
  countries exercise an inordinate influence in determining the nature  and
  direction  of  international  relations  including  economic  and   trade
  relations as well as the rules governing these relations. Many  of  these
  are at the expense of developing countries.

It goes on to say:


  Globalisation should lead to the prospering and empowering of  developing
  countries, not their  continued  impoverishment  and  dependence  on  the
  wealthy and developed world.

The war in Iraq, with all its expected negative consequences for the  region
and  the  world,  will  lead  to   Africa's   further   impoverishment   and
underdevelopment. I am a bit disappointed that some hon members on  my  left
seem to be suffering from schizophrenia and confusion. They said  that  they
are against the war, that the war brings a lot of suffering,  and  that  the
war is not about regime change. But, on  the  other  hand,  they  seemed  to
condemn us because they said we  are  antiwar.  [Interjections.]  They  have
some vague understanding of national interest and anti-Americanism.  Let  me
remind them that antiwar is not anti-Americanism. Millions of Americans  are
also opposed to the war. [Applause.]

We are being subjected to 24-hour media coverage. But the question  that  we
must ask ourselves  is,  ``Are  we  getting  the  truth?''  According  to  a
Business Day article  today,  new  terminology  has  emerged:  the  embedded
journalists have given information controllers the right and power  on  what
to say and when to say it. The global television network is bringing to  the
homes of millions of people the values that the West is trying to  bring  to
the rest of the world - values defined by catchy  phrases  like  ``the  free
Iraq campaign''. That article asks: ``How  and  when  did  basic  journalism
slip through the cracks?'' I believe that only the  journalists  can  answer
that.

Under the strategy of shock and awe we are witnessing an  awesome  storm  of
firepower being unleashed against Iraq. A USA military source  said,  and  I
quote: ``It will be the most serious  aerial  bombardment  in  history.''  I
once again want to reiterate that the  coalition's  decision  to  resort  to
force outside the framework of the UN Security Council is a  tragic  failure
of negotiations and diplomacy. The world remains  sharply  divided  on  this
issue.

I am sure that even the members on my left will agree  that  war  is  not  a
solution to world problems. The vast majority of countries and  billions  of
people throughout  the  world  support  this  position.  That  includes  the
Vatican and all the major religious leaders in the world. At what  cost  can
we ignore the millions of  people  throughout  the  world  who  continue  to
demonstrate against the war? As the Minister said, the war must  not  set  a
precedent  which  further  undermines  multilateralism  and  especially  the
authority of the United Nations and the UN Security Council.

The Government remains fully  committed  to  the  position  that  the  world
should be  free  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  In  this  context,  we
supported the UN Security Council Resolution 1441  which  peacefully  sought
to ensure that Iraq was free of weapons of mass  destruction.  We  therefore
spared no effort to ensure that the resolution  was  implemented  fully  and
successfully within a  reasonable  period  of  time.  In  that  respect,  we
interacted with many countries and consistently urged  the  Iraq  government
to  fully  and  transparently  co-operate  with  the  inspectors.  I   can't
understand why hon Geldenhuys says that we went to Iraq and  gave  President
Saddam Hussein a letter  asking  him  to  stand  firm.  Maybe  he  has  more
information than I have. He had better share it with us.

In  the  last  few  weeks,  as  the  inspectors'  report  shows,  the  Iraqi
authorities intensified their  co-operation  and  substantial  progress  was
made. A day after the war started, Dr Blix briefed the UN  Security  Council
on  their  work  plan  which,  inter  alia,   identified   all   outstanding
disarmament issues and included benchmarks and timeframes to  resolve  those
outstanding issues. He went on to say that the work of the inspectors  would
have been completed within months. Now, all of that  is  academic.  The  war
has started.

We note  the  comments  of  the  Secretary-General,  Kofi  Annan,  that  the
legitimacy of the war without the  UN  Security  Council  mandate  would  be
questioned.  He  urged  the  coalition  to  respect  international  law  and
humanitarian law. The urgent challenge now is to prepare  for  the  possible
negative consequences of the war.  The  critical  challenge  is  to  restore
confidence in the United Nations.  Other  challenges  include,  inter  alia,
increased terrorism, instability  in  the  region  -  which  can  impact  on
international  peace  and  security,  clash  of   civilisations,   increased
religious hatred and intolerance, tragic loss of lives  of  ordinary  Iraqis
and others involved in the war, the humanitarian tragedy, further delays  in
pursuing the Middle East peace process, a global economic slowdown  and  the
volatility in the oil market.

I want to believe that the most immediate and urgent  challenge  that  faces
the international community is the humanitarian  tragedy.  Today  there  are
reports of a humanitarian disaster which is  unfolding  in  the  Basra  area
because there is no electricity or clean water.  We  seriously  regret  that
the food-for-oil programme has  been  suspended.  We  hope  that  the  sharp
divisions that have emerged in the UN and Security Council, the EU and  Nato
and other multilateral  institutions  can  be  resolved  very  soon  because
without unity the world will not be  able  to  tackle  the  many  challenges
facing humanity.

The coalition will undoubtedly win the war. Can they  win  the  peace?  Only
time will tell. The Iraqi war also brings into sharp focus  the  Palestinian
issue. Rachel Corrie, a young American who was in the  prime  of  her  life,
was crushed to death by an Israeli  bulldozer  on  March  16.  In  her  last
letter to her parents she wrote, and I quote:


  I don't know if many of the children here have ever existed without  tank
  shell holes in their walls and the towers of an occupying army  surveying
  them constantly. I think that even the smallest children understand  that
  life is not like this anywhere.

She went on in her letter:


  I wonder if you can forgive the world for all the years of your childhood
  existing, just existing in resistance to the constant stranglehold of the
  world's fourth largest military backed by the world's only superpower  in
  its attempt to erase you from your home.

She then said:


  I think we need to use some of our privileges to get these  voices  heard
  directly in the United States.

She ended by saying:


  I am just beginning to learn about the  ability  of  people  to  organise
  against all odds and to resist against all odds.

The tragic murder of this young idealist must drive us all  to  work  harder
to find a solution to the Middle East crisis. It is absolutely vital that  a
road map which was produced by the United States, the EU and Russia is  made
public and implemented immediately and without any attempted changes by  the
Israeli government. That road map is the only way forward to take  us  to  a
peaceful two-state solution.

We welcome the Palestinian initiatives to start implementing  the  road  map
as reflected by the election of a Prime Minister and the writing  of  a  new
constitution. As part of the presidential Spier project, we recently  hosted
a Palestinian constitutional committee to come and  study  our  experiences.
We are happy to report  that  it  was  a  very  successful  visit.  Minister
Sha'ath, who led the delegation, wrote to the President and said, I quote:


  The committee  has  never  had  an  opportunity  to  meet  with  so  many
  distinguished activists, academics and state persons at one time, all  of
  whom have  so  much  directly  relevant  experience  to  the  process  of
  constitution-making within the framework of  attaining  independence  and
  freedom. We are taking your experiences and the lessons we have learnt to
  heart as we continue in our efforts to  create  a  truly  legitimate  and
  visionary constitution with the Palestinian people.

We also hosted an Israeli security and intelligence group in February.  That
visit too was very successful. The leader of the Israeli  delegation,  in  a
letter to the South African Government, said and I quote:


  In the week that has passed since our return we have  had  some  time  to
  digest  the  discussions  and  the  valuable  lessons  that  we   learnt.
  Naturally, each of us will come away with  a  particular  experience  but
  overall we all share a strong conviction that South  Africa's  experience
  has much to offer us Israelis and Palestinians. I hope that we can indeed
  address the perceptions regarding South Africa's disposition in order  to
  expose a wider circle of Israelis to these insights that  we  experienced
  while we were in Cape Town.

Clearly, the South African  Government,  in  the  totality  of  its  foreign
policy activities, is attempting to bring  about  peace  and  stability  not
only on our continent - as the Minister reflected - but also  in  two  major
conflict  situations:  the  Palestinian-Israeli  conflict  and   the   Iraqi
conflict because those are the two fundamental issues that impact  on  world
peace, security and stability.

I want to stress that if we do not  solve  those  two  issues  quickly,  the
Pandora's box of terrorism that everybody has referred  to  will  be  opened
and we will all be living in a very grossly unstable and insecure  world.  I
don't think that this is what Rachel Corrie died for. I  think  that  if  we
want to pay tribute to her sacrifice we must, as I said  earlier,  intensify
our efforts both to bring about peace between the Palestinians and  Israelis
and indeed to ensure that the war against Iraq is ended soon.

Walt Whitman, 130 years ago, in his  poem  Passage  to  India  wrote  and  I
quote:


  Year at whose wide-flung door I sing!
  Year of the purpose accomplish'd!
  Year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans!
  I see O year in you the vast terraqueous globe and giving all.
  Europe to Asia, Africa join'd, and they to the New World,
  The lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival garland,
  As brides and bridegrooms hand in hand.

This is humanity's challenge. I hope that we can as a nation respond to  it.
Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, there  are  a  number  of
you who are holding conversations loud enough for me to hear in  the  Chair.
You are going to disturb the speaker. May I please ask you to keep order  in
the House.

Dr P W A MULDER: Mr Chairman, during the period of the  so-called  Cold  War
the countries of the world were divided into  the  Eastern  bloc  countries,
the Western  bloc  countries,  and  the  Non-Aligned  Movement.  The  United
Nations, the Non-Aligned  Movement  and  the  African  countries  played  an
important part in a balancing  act  between  the  Eastern  and  the  Western
blocs.

That gave Africa international political power, far above our real  strength
and our real ability to influence international events.  The  Cold  War  era
ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union. In the past  10
years, the international  world  has  been  busy  with  the  realignment  of
nations and with a re-evaluation of international instruments like the UN.

South Africa and the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  must  not  make  the
mistake of trying to understand the world of the 21st century  in  Cold  War
terms. That period, with an East and West bloc, is forever gone. In the  new
world, or the so-called new world, there is only one superpower, namely  the
United States of America.

When I listened to some of  the  speeches  in  this  House,  it  seemed  the
speakers still think we are in the Cold War period, that Africa still  plays
an important role and that we can force or blackmail the United States  into
doing what we think is best for the world. As a  small  country,  we  cannot
change these new realities. Whether I like it nor not, that is the  reality.
We must accept it and start playing according  to  the  new  rules  for  the
benefit of South Africa.
President Mbeki is more realistic than most of the  previous  speakers  with
his Nepad proposals. This new  world  is  economically  divided  into  three
economic power blocs. The European Union is on the one  side,  the  Americas
are on the other and the far Eastern countries are a  third  grouping,  with
Japan and China playing a major role. Africa is not  mentioned  as  a  role-
player in this league of super-economic blocs.

President Mbeki's Nepad proposals consider this, take it  into  account  and
are the only way that South Africa and  Africa  can  prevent  our  continent
from being left behind forever and start playing  a  role.  But  then  Nepad
must succeed. I'm afraid that this Government, because  it  still  sometimes
thinks in Cold War terms, is making mistakes internationally  that  endanger
the Nepad proposals.

An American senator recently said that South  Africa  asks  for  money  from
Western countries, and specifically from the G8  countries,  but  the  South
African Government is friendly with all the enemies of  the  West.  That  is
correct. This is not a pro-Western or an anti-African point  of  view.  This
is a common-sense point of view. And I speak as an African. I repeat:  As  a
small country, we cannot change these new realities. We must accept  it  and
start playing according to these new rules.  Place  the  best  interests  of
Africa first, and of all of us as we sit here.

Meneer, in Afrikaans is daar die gesegde dat jy  nie  jou  brood  aan  albei
kante gebotter kan hê nie. As Minister Zuma  op  3  Maart  vanjaar  vir  die
Pretoria se persklub  sê  dat  Suid-Afrika  nooit  Zimbabwe  sal  veroordeel
solank die ANC aan die bewind is nie, klink dit na  Koue  Oorlog-denke.  Dis
'n ernstige fout en dis sleg vir Nepad.

Tien dae later veroordeel President Mbeki Zimbabwe as  hy  in  Gaborone  sê,
ons sien al geruime tyd die aangeleentheid in Zimbabwe word nie reg  benader
nie. Minister Zuma se "nooit" het toe tien dae geword voordat  die  ANC  wel
Zimbabwe veroordeel het.

Meneer, niemand durf die gevolge van die oorlog in Irak onderskat  nie.  Wat
veral belangrik gaan wees, is hoe die internasionale politiek ná die  oorlog
gaan verander. President Bush het die Verenigde Nasies  en  sy  tradisionele
bondgenote soos Frankryk en Duitsland geïgnoreer in sy besluit om  Irak  aan
te val. Dit gaan die rol en die plek van die Verenigde Nasies ná die  oorlog
ingrypend verander, is my voorspelling.

Hierdie Parlement se Buitelandse Sake Komitee het die  Verenigde  Nasies  in
1999 besoek. Die spanning tussen Amerika en die  Verenigde  Nasies  was  toe
reeds duidelik. In belang van Suid-Afrika moet  ons  hierdie  nuwe  situasie
koelkop benader. Koue Oorlog-denke gaan tot die verkeerde besluite lei.  Ons
enigste riglyn, of dit nou oor Zimbabwe gaan of oor die toekomstige rol  van
die Verenigde Nasies, of oor Amerika, moet wees wat is in belang  van  Suid-
Afrika en Afrika. Niks  anders  speel  'n  rol  daar  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There is a saying to the effect that you can't have your cake and  eat  it.
When Minister Zuma told the Pretoria Press Club on 3 March  this  year  that
South Africa would never condemn Zimbabwe as long as the ANC was  in  power,
it sounded like Cold War thinking. This is a serious mistake and it  is  bad
for Nepad.

Ten days later President Mbeki condemned Zimbabwe when he said  in  Gaborone
that we have been able to see for some time now that the matter in  Zimbabwe
was never approached correctly.  Minister  Zuma's  "never"  became  10  days
before the ANC did indeed condemn
Zimbabwe.

No one dares underestimate the consequences of the  war  in  Iraq.  What  is
going to be important is how international politics will  change  after  the
war. President Bush ignored the United Nations and  his  traditional  allies
like France and Germany in his decision to attack  Iraq.  My  prediction  is
that this will dramatically change the role and the position of  the  United
Nations after the war.

This Parliament's foreign affairs committee visited the  United  Nations  in
1999. The tension between America and the United Nations was  already  clear
at that stage. In the interests of South Africa we must  approach  this  new
situation calmly. Cold War thinking will lead to the  wrong  decisions.  Our
only guideline, whether the issue is Zimbabwe, or the  future  role  of  the
United Nations, or America, must be  what  is  in  the  interests  of  South
Africa and Africa. Nothing else plays a role there.]

I had planned on complimenting Dr Pallo Jordan on his role as chairman,  but
I think he is worried  that  it  might  be  a  kiss  of  death  so  I  won't
compliment him at all. I will maybe build his image  and  say  he's  a  very
dangerous ANC man. [Laughter.] Thank you, Sir.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Deputy Chairperson, as we  are  about  to  discuss  the
financial matters of the budget on foreign affairs, we  are  confronted  and
reminded once again by the sound of bombs raining down on Iraq.  It  is  sad
that innocent civilians are caught in the crossfire in a war that is not  of
their own making.

As South Africans, and in particular the Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  we
have to ask again and again: Is there a chance that we can stop this war  at
this stage? Have we done enough to prevent the outbreak of this  unjust  war
in the first place? Are our  missions  abroad  effective  in  promoting  and
communicating our foreign policy in a manner that advances our interest  and
contributes to  the  efforts  by  our  counterparts  elsewhere  in  pursuing
peaceful  settlement  in  dealing  with  global  issues  affecting  us  all,
negatively or positively?

These are the  challenges  that  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  should
address in justifying the resources that this department is requesting.  The
department has put it to us that at least an amount of R29,9  million  would
be raised  through  the  sale  of  properties  that  it  does  not  need  in
accordance with its  policy  objectives.  We  need  to  know  which  foreign
properties would be sold and the reasons for  their  disposal.  If  we  sell
these assets for the sake of selling in order to raise funds  in  the  short
term,  are  we  not  running  the  risk  of  having  to  rent  offices   and
accommodation in the near future for our needs? Have we  investigated  other
options of turning these identified assets into income  generation  for  the
department?

The danger is that we will do so at the ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  member,  would  you  just
take your seat? Thank you. Hon member, you may now carry on.

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: The danger is that we will do so at a  higher  cost  in
terms of paying in foreign currency to compensate for short-term  gains.  We
should really apply our minds with regard to the proposed disposal of  these
assets.  In  addition,  we  need  to  establish  the  true  value  of  these
properties earmarked for sale if we indeed proceed  with  this  plan.  There
have been cases where some of Government's assets were alleged to have  been
sold below their actual  market  value.  Has  the  department  identified  a
specific property management company to handle the proposed sale? We  should
not sell if the market conditions are not favourable,  even  though  we  are
going to earn in foreign currency. We hope this is not  the  case  with  the
department to balance their books.

It has to be emphasised  that  the  revenue  raised  as  a  result  of  this
exercise should not be used to fund  staff  salaries,  but  sustainable  and
development programmes of the department, in  particular  training  of  more
diplomatic foreign corps ... [Time expired.]

Mrs F MAHOMED: In the name of God,  Most  Gracious,  Most  Merciful.  Deputy
Chair, Minister, Deputy Minister, colleagues and  friends,  our  charismatic
leadership assert themselves on all matters promoting  good  governance  and
respect for  human  rights.  We  thank  you.  Clearly,  our  foreign  policy
objectives are reiterated in all our efforts bilaterally and  multilaterally
to ensure that the interests  of  the  developing  countries  are  taken  on
board.

We support this Budget Vote and I am happy to say the DFA's budget  increase
for international organisation of 79,5% caters mainly  for  a  R170  million
transfer to the World Food Programme. This was a transfer payment to  donate
100 000 metric tons of maize to countries in the SADC region which are  most
seriously affected by food shortages.

Since  the  1940s,  multilateral  organs  have  continued  to  advocate  the
interest of a few in  the  world.  Tactical  marginalisation  and  the  poor
global community ensure that the rich become  richer  and  the  poor  remain
poor. The greatest challenge for multilateral institutions is  to  meet  the
global  challenges  of  humanity  as  a  whole.  True   democratisation   is
imperative so that inclusion and transparency are realised.

The UN's  mandate  is  to  save  humanity  from  the  scourge  of  war.  Its
responsibility demands that it seek peaceful resolution of conflicts in  the
world. If some members of  the  UN  Security  Council  flagrantly  defy  the
multilateral organs, their actions question  the  very  existence  of  these
organs. The  naked  aggression  of  the  US  military  forces  invading  the
sovereignty, integrity and dignity of the Iraqi people is  blatant  defiance
of multilateralism.
It is rather disturbing that the UN Security Council is unable to deal  with
member states who continuously flout UN resolutions.  Such  acts  of  terror
lead to catastrophic consequences in terms of crime  against  humanity.  The
unjust Iraqi war unilaterally imposed by the US and its  allies  has  thrown
the whole world into uncertainty and despair. Most  nations  are  vehemently
protesting  the  arbitrary  action,  which  shows  a  clear   violation   of
international humanitarian law. The hopelessness of  war  and  the  loss  of
innocent lives of women and children is  catastrophic.  Peace  and  security
globally is threatened for all.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is predicted by many to  worsen,  and  more
innocent lives will be lost. Let us hope it will not happen. Again,  the  UN
resolutions are flagrantly defied. The single most important instrument  for
creating a conducive place for good governance is peace  and  security,  and
if that is threatened, the ripple effect of any developmental agenda of  any
country is hampered.

It  is  disconcerting  that  since  the  1940s  continuous   debates   about
restructuring and reform of the UN only end up in the  so-called  open-ended
working  group  which  in  reality  means  nothing   but   illustrates   the
hopelessness of empty rhetoric. Multilateralism seems to be  a  macho  organ
of men only. It is about time  that  more  women  served  on  the  important
multilateral organs so that true transformation of the global  community  is
realised.

President Mbeki called on member states, at the 57th session of the  general
assembly, to work together and strengthen the multilateral system to  ensure
that global problems are addressed in the interest of the global community.

It is a proud moment for South Africans as we are currently not only  making
a difference in the lives of our own people, but our Government  is  playing
an important role in the global community. We are currently serving  on  the
Economic and Social Council, the Commission on Human Rights, the  Commission
on the Status of Women, the Commission for Programme and Co-ordination,  and
the UN Statistical Commission. That  is  really  commendable.  We  are  also
members of the International Seabed Authority and Chair  the  UN  Commission
on Sustainable Development.

We need to honour and commend our own Justice Navanethem Pillay who  is  now
one of the eighteen judges  in  the  International  Criminal  Court  in  the
Hague. Kumi Naidoo was appointed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan  to  the
UN panel responsible for examining  the  links  between  the  UN  and  civil
society.

In terms of disarmament and arms proliferation,  we  have  continued  active
participation in the international debate on  disarmament,  nonproliferation
and arms control. Our Government has utilised multilateral forums to  ensure
that a  regulatory  mechanism  does  not  limit  the  access  of  developing
countries to technology and material  required  for  peaceful  socioeconomic
development.

Many debates continue to question the very existence of the WTO. Some  claim
that  it  was  not  necessary  to  increase  the  World  Trade  Organisation
seventeenfold.  Others  say  that  this  increase  was  attributed  to   the
flexibility of the GATT trade regime. The birth of the WTO in 1995  was  not
due to the collapse of world trade, as was experienced in the 1930s.  Others
argue that its very existence was not justified to maintain global peace  as
is evident in the 5 inter-state wars, that is, the Korean War,  the  Vietnam
War, the Arab-Israeli War, the Falklands and the Gulf War.

It is evident that armed conflict was no reason for  the  existence  of  the
WTO. However, following the Uruguay rounds in  1986-94,  the  initial  seeds
for the WTO were planted.

It is believed that the WTO serves primarily the interest of  the  developed
countries which have taken this opportunity to extend it to  the  TRIMs  and
the TRIPS, which refer to a Trade-Related Investment Measures and the Trade-
Related Intellectual Property Rights, for their own benefit.

Our Government actively participated in  the  WTO  negotiations  in  Geneva.
Many problems were encountered during the agricultural negotiations  due  to
the reluctance of developed countries to  reduce  the  export  subsidies  of
domestic support. Other areas of contention were  trade-related  aspects  of
international property rights and  public  health.  No  agreement  has  been
reached with regard to timeframes or deadlines and this is a  grave  concern
for tangible and real development to take place in our country. There  is  a
fear that if these concerns are not addressed and  resolved,  then  the  WTO
ministerial meeting in Cancun, Mexico in September 2003 could be futile.

If the international agenda is committed to halving  the  number  of  people
living in poverty by 2015, then fundamental change will have to  take  place
in terms of nondiscrimination and a serious  effort  to  level  the  playing
fields globally. A  concrete  plan  of  action  must  effectively  implement
sustainable developmental objectives on a global level.

With this in mind, we have many  challenges  ahead  of  us.  Therefore,  our
vigilance and  resourcefulness  will  allow  us  to  face  up  to  the  huge
complexities to realise our own developmental agenda and then embrace it  to
compete on the global level.

The World Bank and the  International  Monetary  Fund  must  and  should  be
reformed so that the global financial architecture  is  able  to  prioritise
the needs  of  developing  countries.  Marginalisation,  discrimination  and
indifference are not characteristic traits of  democratic  institutions.  It
also needs to be noted that the World Bank and  the  IMF  are  not  research
institutions which churn  out  written  reports  only,  but  should  play  a
pivotal role in changing the lives of ordinary human beings who  are  really
the end users. Unjust control of access to credit for the  developing  world
will exacerbate poverty and underdevelopment.

Reform of the Bretton Woods institutions is imperative so  that  a  holistic
approach  is  taken  to  achieve  sound  financial  governance.   Developing
countries should be relieved of their huge debt burden, which  has  negative
consequences for improving the lives of our people.

Renewed and accelerated efforts should be made to  promote  our  South-South
relations. Missions need to be resourced and capacitated to achieve  success
in this area.

The world agenda in helping developing countries will be negligible  as  the
World Bank and the  multilateral  finance  institutions  will  redefine  and
reprioritise their spending by earmarking more money for the  reconstruction
of Iraq rather than  developmental  issues.  It  is  about  destruction  and
reconstruction. All else is irrelevant for the developed world.

While we are aware that there are a handful of people who are architects  of
a master plan of world domination, it is disconcerting that this plan  seeks
to illegally exploit the natural resources and  other  forms  of  wealth  in
developing countries in the name of  trade  or  other  related  jargon.  Our
region is being raped of our mineral  resources,  timber,  forestry,  fauna,
flora and endangered species.

If good governance and respect for the rule of law  is  to  be  upheld,  the
implementation of international humanitarian law and cultural  heritage  law
is crucial. The present  crisis  in  Iraq  poses  many  challenges  in  this
regard. I am happy to say  a  number  of  SADC  states  have  established  a
national plan for international humanitarian law.

Issues of good governance,  democracy  and  transparency  are  paramount  to
world peace. The governments of major industrial powers dominate the  agenda
of the World Bank, IMF and WTO. The buzz  words,  namely  globalisation  and
trade liberalisation, need to  make  fundamental  shifts  in  the  lives  of
people. We need to become aware that  the  sponsored  structural  adjustment
programmes almost imposed by the World Bank and IMF  limit  the  sovereignty
of nation states to a great extent.

Hunger and abject poverty in many countries is a  stark  reality  today.  We
must call for an end  to  the  dominance  of  rich  countries.  It  is  also
encouraging that our ACP-EU partnership supports our  Nepad  objectives.  As
for  the  Commonwealth,  our  President  as  the  chairperson  oversaw   the
successful conclusion of the high-level review group on the  review  of  the
Commonwealth and its governance. Our Government's  contribution  to  NAM  is
also phenomenal and we hope that our commitment to respect  the  sovereignty
and territorial integrity of all countries in the world is upheld.

In conclusion, the catastrophic  crises  in  the  world,  for  example,  the
horrific and pre-emptive war in Iraq, leave us with many global  challenges.
Many concerns arise: Who will draw the new boundaries around the world?  Who
will hold the balance of power in the world? How will the  global  community
reconstitute itself? Are globalisation and liberalisation  other  names  for
recolonisation? Is the acquisition of greasy  oil  more  valuable  than  the
spilling of blood of humankind?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! May  I  request  the  Whips  to
assist the Chair. I think some of the Whips themselves are out of order,  so
would they please bring themselves to order and help to keep  their  members
in order. [Interjections.]

I think, hon members,  it  is  objectionable  for  you  to  continue,  on  a
repeated basis, to speak in  a  manner  that  is  disruptive.  You  are  not
conversing in a manner that is quiet and  allows  for  the  main  debate  to
proceed. It is disturbing and  of  the  type  of  volume  that  I  think  is
unacceptable in Parliament. May I please ask you and the Whips to assist.

Dr S E M PHEKO: The PAC supports the Budget  Vote  on  Foreign  Affairs.  We
think that the money allocated to  this  department  is  inadequate  in  the
light of the fluid situation in the world. Because of the  limited  time  at
my disposal, I will deal with a few issues which  the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs must take cognisance of. At any rate, I am sure her  department  has
already done so.

The war in Iraq will affect this budget but,  above  all,  our  country  and
continent and the rest of the world must rise to the occasion and rally  the
world for peace and justice in international relations. It is  therefore  an
illegal  war.  For  the  first  time  since  the  League  of  Nations,   the
predecessor of the UN, the world has a war which has not been sanctioned  by
the United Nations Security Council. This makes this war an illegal war.

Britain and the United States of America are bombing and killing  women  and
children in Iraq. Their reason is that they are destroying weapons  of  mass
destruction whilst, back in their own countries, they have weapons  of  mass
destruction which are  100  times  more  powerful.  South  Africa's  foreign
policy must be based on justice and on the legal obligation that all  member
states of the United Nations must abide by the charter of this  world  body.
The present world situation gives us a  golden  opportunity  to  reform  the
United Nations. Our foreign policy must  contribute  to  this.  The  African
Union must speak with one voice.

Back on our continent, the DRC political formations must  approve  and  sign
the constitution and security agreement which will move  the  peace  process
forward.

Current world events will affect the new partnership for  development  which
depends on G8 countries, including the USA. Events in the world call  for  a
foreign policy which, though seeking assistance from  others,  is  based  on
self-reliance.

Let us have a foreign policy that  flows  from  the  logic  of  the  African
situation. Let us remember even in our darkest  hour  that  our  martyrs  of
ancient times, in bracing their minds to outward  calamities,  acquired  the
loftiness of purpose and moral heroism  with  a  lifetime  of  security  and
prosperity. Let us defend justice in the world and pursue a  foreign  policy
which  promotes  equality  and  respect  of  all  nations.  Let  us   resist
imperialist domination in all its forms. Let us  oppose  selective  morality
in international affairs. [Applause.]

Mr O BAPELA: Deputy Chairperson, the ANC fully supports the budget  for  the
year 2003-04, including  programmes  as  stipulated  by  the  Department  of
Foreign Affairs. Important in the  programmes  are  the  strategic  and  key
political aspects which have put South Africa  as  an  important  player  in
international politics and global affairs.  The  successes  in  holding  the
World Conference on Racism, Racial Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and  Related
Intolerance and the launch of the African Union last year in 2002  are  some
of the highlights of our role which received acknowledgement by the world.

We continue to strengthen solidarity with  the  developing  world,  building
partnerships with the developed world to foster sustainable development.  We
are also promoting good governance,  sustainable  socioeconomic  development
and poverty  eradication  in  Africa,  and  participating  in  international
efforts to seek everlasting peace and stability in conflict-ridden areas.

Again South Africa was  chairperson  of  the  Non-Aligned  Movement  and  is
currently chairperson of the African Union and  is  participating  in  SADC,
the Commonwealth committee, Sacu, the United Nations and all its bodies  and
in all the Bretton Woods institutions.

The world has integrated and become a village but the gap between  the  rich
and poor countries is huge.  If  we  are  to  succeed  in  playing  a  role,
championing  our  values  and  strategic  goals  for  a  better  world   for
humankind, we must be active players and lead when  appointed  to  positions
of importance. We also should educate our  people  to  know  and  understand
that the world has changed and is changing. While  domestic  issues  are  of
critical importance and indeed they are a priority  to  our  Government  and
our movement - and we should address  them  -  we  need  the  world  bodies,
bilateral agreements, multilateral institutions, fair trade relations,  etc,
for us to  be  able  to  narrow  the  gap  between  the  developed  and  the
developing countries.

Our people must know  that  when  the  leadership  of  our  country  attends
meetings, it is  about  engaging  on  these  challenges.  It  is  about  the
narrowing of the widened gap between the rich and the poor and  it  is  also
about  championing  or  advancing  the  aspirations  of  the   Third   World
countries.  Therefore  they  should  reject  and  denounce   the   so-called
prophetic verses of the doom prophets who say that we care  less  about  the
domestic challenges. The doom prophets lack vision and behave  as  if  South
Africa is not an African country and act as if South Africa is not  part  of
the poor countries of the South. Refuse to be  fooled  and  they  will  come
amongst you and tell lies about this  Government  not  caring,  as  if  they
cared. Let them not mislead you with their smooth talk, and  beware  -  they
will even come to you and  claim  easy  victories.  This  reminds  me  of  a
quotation by one of the great African leaders, Amilca Cabral, when he  said:
``Tell no lies and claim no easy victories.''

From now on, our people should know that when the President  or  the  Deputy
President or the Ministers and Deputy Ministers travel,  they  are  engaging
with issues of the world. It is  because  they  care  about  you.  They  are
engaging the world to create a better one, are raising issues  of  the  poor
countries which South Africa is part of,  and  they  are  involved  on  your
behalf in levelling the playing field in matters of trade and investment  to
push back the frontiers of poverty in our  country  and  in  the  developing
countries.

The Foreign Affairs Budget Vote is taking place, unfortunately,  at  a  time
when the world and the international situation is in crisis as a  result  of
the war in Iraq. We have witnessed, for the  past  five  days,  the  raining
down of heavy bombs on Iraq in an operation called  ``shock  and  awe''.  We
see and hear sounds of explosions and thunder, sirens wailing,  smoke  going
up in some cities of Iraq, soldiers under cover of  tanks,  and  gun  planes
and helicopters moving into Iraq as if we were watching a Hollywood  movies.
Millions of people in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa,  including
here at home  and  all  over  the  world,  are  shocked,  terrified,  angry,
dismayed, horrified and continue to oppose the war as the means  to  resolve
our problems.

Repeatedly the  ANC  and  our  Government  have  stated  in  statements  and
speeches that any war on Iraq must be a UN-sanctioned war.  We  have  stated
that we do not hold a brief for Saddam Hussein and we  do  not  support  nor
did we support the regime of Saddam Hussein. The ANC is also not  supporting
any unilateral position taken by the most  powerful  nations  whose  actions
undermine the very important institutions that were created to be  platforms
for settling disputes and for creating a better world. We  as  the  ANC  are
not on any side in this war and merely are opposed  to  it  to  protect  the
principle of multilateral politics, and  call  for  respect  of  the  United
Nations and the international laws.

South Africa contributed immensely to the debate in  the  world  in  arguing
for the UN resolution to be fully implemented. We also sent a delegation  to
meet with Iraqi authorities to urge them  to  comply  fully  and  co-operate
with the UN for Iraq to fully implement the UN resolution. We  also  offered
help by sending our scientists to Iraq.  Unfortunately,  as  the  offer  was
being considered, the war started.

However, some in the House continuously and deliberately  distort  positions
of the Government and those of the ANC. They either  tell  lies  to  deceive
the  nation  or  for  political  point-scoring,  even  on  matters  of  such
magnitude for the wellbeing of the world.

I do not think the ANC is speaking in parables in this House. To quote  from
Scripture, reading in Matthew, Chapter 13:13:


  Though seeing, they do not see;
  though hearing,
  they do not understand.

And it continues to say:


  `You will be ever-hearing
  but never understanding;
  you will be ever-seeing
  but never perceiving.
  For these people's heart
  has become calloused;
  they hardly hear with their ears,
  and they have closed their eyes.

It would seem  some  in  the  House  have  genetically  modified  brains  or
genetically modified minds. They can't think  straight;  their  thinking  is
skewed. For example, they are the ones who were  pushing  everybody  to  the
extent of calling the ANC cowards about the legislation on crossing  of  the
floor. When it  happened  last  in  the  local  government  elections,  they
screamed that the ANC wanted to create  a  one-party  state  and  that  this
spelled the end of multiparty democracy. So they claimed.  Today,  they  are
the ones smiling for getting new members who joined them from  the  New  NP.
[Interjections.]

Today we see the most powerful and strong saying they are  right  in  acting
unilaterally; the strong and powerful saying they have  all  the  rights  in
the world, and the strong and powerful who say they have no constraints.  We
see the strong  and  powerful  bullying  everybody  and  cajoling  the  weak
nations and undermining the very multilateral  institutions  we  set  up  to
resolve political disputes.

Our focus as a country  is  to  ensure  that  bodies  such  as  the  UN  are
transformed and strengthened to meet the challenges of the 21st century  and
our major challenge, post-war, is to bring back the respect  and  confidence
to such bodies. We dare not fail.

Africa's programme, Nepad, will  suffer  a  setback  as  the  world  is  now
focusing on Iraq and the programme  is  off  the  agenda  of  world  bodies.
Instead of focusing on peace, development  and  the  creation  of  a  better
world, the main focus is on the war in Iraq and, thereafter, it will  be  on
post-war Iraq. Many see war on Iraq as annexation;  others  say  it  is  the
colonisation of that country, and yet  other  views  say  the  powerful  and
strong will change governments elected by people in countries  that  opposed
war and those regarded as part of the  axis  of  evil.  Many  more  will  be
worried about loyalties and will lose their focus on the fundamental  issues
of development in the Third World countries.

South  Africa  continues  to  play  a  role  in  the  global  community  and
particularly in Africa. There is a wider acceptance and  acknowledgement  of
the role South Africa is playing in global  affairs,  as  described  by  the
Department of Foreign Affairs.

My focus in this Budget Vote debate is mainly on Africa  and  its  continued
challenges, which are underdevelopment; nongrowing economies; diseases  such
as malaria, TB,  HIV/Aids,  malnutrition;  conflicts;  coups  d'état;  human
rights violations; lack of access to land; illiteracy and innumeracy;  wars;
exploitation of its natural  resources;  and  refugees  fleeing  from  their
homes and wars or conflicts in their own  countries.  As  we  meet  in  this
august House, another coup d'état took place two weeks ago  in  the  Central
African Republic. No one has spoken about the coup d'état  except  the  ANC.
Not even the so-called proponents of good governance and  human  rights,  as
they anointed the title to themselves during the debate on  the  Nepad  peer
review mechanism last year in November, have said anything. They are  quiet.
To them, Africa is Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe is Africa.

It is unfortunate that even in this era where African leaders  have  pledged
and committed themselves to ridding the country of the bad  image  of  coups
d'état, there are still amongst us those who are  bent  on  continuing  with
their greedy motives for power at all cost. A week before  the  coup  d'état
in the Central African Republic, the  ANC  assigned  me  to  meet  with  the
delegation, led by the special presidential envoy and accompanied by one  of
the leaders of the opposition parties, who were in the country to study  and
share our experience of negotiations, in particular  on  reconciliation  and
nation-building. Their country was already preparing itself to  dialogue  on
problems facing their nation. I spent seven hours in their  meeting  due  to
interpretations of English and French, and they were fascinated by  the  way
South Africa handled its internal problems and transition.  They  had  also,
during their stay, met with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the SA  Human
Rights Commission, and the commissioners from the now wrapped-up  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission. We are shocked as the  ANC  to  learn  about  the
coup d'état.

The Department of Foreign Affairs continues to play  an  admirable  role  in
ensuring that all disputes and  conflicts  in  the  continent  are  resolved
speedily, and is raising the flag of  our  country  and  its  leadership  in
acting with the people of Africa  to  resolve  our  problems  and  face  the
challenges. You  are  indeed  implementing  the  programme  of  the  African
Renaissance and must be commended for the good work, Minister.

We read the report presented to Parliament that spells out some of  the  key
challenges facing the continent, amongst which are:  problems  in  the  Côte
d'Ivoire, the Inter-Congolese dialogue, Angola, Burundi and also Rwanda  and
Uganda relations, Somalia, Comoros  Islands  and  Sudan.  On  the  issue  of
Zimbabwe, the ANC supports the Government process  of  engagement  with  all
stakeholders, including the government of Zimbabwe, the ruling party,  Zanu-
PF, the opposition  MDC  and  the  civil  society  groupings,  for  them  to
dialogue and find solutions which will bring stability and  an  end  to  the
political problems and economic crisis facing Zimbabwe. Shouting  or  making
a noise and ventilating amount to hot air.

Condemning Zimbabwe, as the opposition parties want us to do, will not  help
in the resolution of the problem. Quiet diplomacy, by its very nature, is  a
dialogue between states. The attempt in any quiet diplomacy is to  influence
another state that is sovereign  to  assist  it  in  achieving  the  desired
objective.

On the question of Swaziland, as the  ANC,  we  request  the  Government  to
include it in its programme and use quiet diplomacy  by  engaging  with  the
Kingdom of Swaziland and  the  government  for  constitutional  reforms.  In
Swaziland, the constitution was suspended in  1973.  All  political  parties
are banned. There are still detentions and torture and the  king  is  ruling
by decree. Recently, there  were  reports  by  Amnesty  International  which
indicate violations of human rights and  we  should  assist  the  people  of
Swaziland as we do those of other countries on the continent, through  quiet
diplomacy, to resolve their problems.

The problem of poverty remains the biggest challenge for Africa.  Currently,
the Southern Africa region is afflicted by famine. The New  Partnership  for
Africa's Development is not only the newest and  most  fashionable  game  on
the African continent, but  also  the  latest  in  the  efforts  by  African
political  leaders  to  deal  collectively  with  the  countless   national,
regional  and  continental  political   and   socioeconomic   problems   and
development challenges facing Africa. The challenge with the  focus  on  war
in Iraq, as the President put it yesterday at  the  All  Africa  Council  of
Churches in Johannesburg, is:


  Although Nepad and the AU are on track, the war  will  affect  Nepad  and
  African programmes. It will hamper development in Africa. Africa will  go
  back in terms of attention given. We have to rely on  our  resources,  we
  have to rely on our efforts and on our resources to the  many  challenges
  facing the continent.

It has been the critics' view that we should not rely too  much  on  foreign
funding for Nepad and, at the time,  they  said  Nepad  would  turn  into  a
leopard and devour all of us. We must mobilise  our  domestic  resources  as
the continent in addition to foreign funding and advance the  objectives  of
Nepad. Also, we must  create  for  ourselves  markets  and  increased  trade
amongst ourselves as the  nations  in  Africa  if  we  are  to  conquer  our
challenges.

In conclusion, we must, with  urgency,  as  a  country  and  the  continent,
implement the resolutions of the World  Conference  Against  Racism,  Racial
Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and  Related  Intolerance,   and   also   those
resolutions of the WSSD. The ANC joins the people here and  the  world  over
in the condemnation of the war. The ANC also recommits itself, as it did  at
the Stellenbosch national conference, to the creation  of  a  better  Africa
and world. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson.  The  Minority  Front  notes
the hefty task the department is challenged with.

Politics in the country  is  tedious  to  contend  with,  let  alone  global
politics and pressure where each step has to be counted a  number  of  times
before being taken. In view of this, the  MF  applauds  the  department  and
hopes that the budget allocated for the  financial  period  2003-4  will  be
beneficially  utilised  to  the  advancement  of  South  Africa  in  foreign
relations.

Global diversities  and  tensions  certainly  challenge  the  department  in
building relations with foreign countries, and the MF congratulates them  on
the positive reception thus far. Our eager participation  and  adherence  to
the international organisations and  institutions  also  serve  to  gain  us
better access to these intended relations.

The measurable objectives of foreign relations appear to be successful  thus
far. However, being swung into situations such  as  Zimbabwe,  the  Israeli-
Palestinian  conflict  and  now  the  Iraqi-American  war,  where   we   are
pressurised into siding and playing a part, poses much  difficulty  for  the
department. It is not always easy to maintain neutral ground and  the  South
African  people  whom  we  serve  are  certainly  watching  our   movements,
contributions and effects in that respect. Thus,  the  positive  image  that
the department  is  trying  to  paint  through  their  programme  of  public
diplomacy and protocol plays its part here, whereby this positive  image  is
to be conveyed both domestically and internationally.

The department's increased involvement internationally  is  expected  to  be
costly. Noting that a large  percentage  of  the  budget  is  allocated  for
payment to those employed   internationally,  it  would  have  to  be  asked
whether  a  reduction  in  persons  accompanying  those  employed  could  be
implemented by  a  certain  percentage  to  further  accommodate  escalating
departmental costs.

The MF is, however, impressed by the  good  work  and  neutrality  that  the
department has maintained globally, and wishes the department  well  in  the
forthcoming year in all endeavours and missions.
The MF supports Budget Vote No 3 on Foreign Affairs. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, it seems as if foreign issues  frequently  are
more explosive than the many internal issues and problems with  which  South
Africans have to cope. I ask myself  the  question  why.  Surely  issues  on
labour, crime, poverty, and even  racism  should  raise  more  emotion  than
these often remote problems. Why are foreign issues such  a  dividing  force
in our politics; sometimes much more so than in the sphere  of  civil  life?
Is it because foreign issues often serve as the battlefield for our  deepest
own unresolved differences and our divided past and backgrounds?

In some way, we have reached the maturity to address internal problems in  a
practical way and to find solutions -  not  always  satisfactorily,  but  at
least  we  have  opened  debate  with   issues   and   particularities   and
practicalities - a deciding factor. The moment, however, we address  foreign
issues,  it's  more  than  often  as  if  different  worlds  and   different
backgrounds meet each other on the battlefield.

Dikwels kry 'n mens dan ook die gevoel  asof  die  Regering  se  buitelandse
beleid self gekenmerk word deur 'n polariserende  tweeslagtigheid.  Aan  die
een kant is daar die besef dat die heil van Suid-Afrika en Afrika lê by  die
lande van die vrye  wêreld;  lande  met  'n  vrye  ekonomie  en  gesonde  en
gevestigde demokratiese beginsels. Hierdie is lande van  wie  ons  afhanklik
is vir handel en beleggings. Aan die ander kant heers die  ou  ''struggle''-
sentimente en word die finale lojaliteit bewys aan oud-strydgenote. Dit  lei
tot  eensydige  en  weifelende  optrede  in  ons  buitelandse   verhoudinge,
byvoorbeeld Irak.

Die Nasionale Aksie is verlig dat president Mbeki sedert  die  uitbreek  van
die tweede  Golfoorlog  die  ANC  se  anti-Amerikaanse  retoriek  aansienlik
afgeskaal het. Ons is bly daaroor. Sekere uitsprake wat selfs as  pro-Saddam
vertolk kon word, het ons land op groot risiko gestel. Hier dink  ons  veral
aan die vrese van die ANC se Sekretaris-generaal  toe  die  VSA  Suid-Afrika
aanval vir ons minerale of die Minister van Gesondheid wat  eerder  duikbote
wil koop as antiretrovirale middels omdat die VSA blykbaar 'n groter  gevaar
vir Suid-Afrika is as Vigs. Ja, selfs oudpresident  Mandela  se  neerhalende
verwysings na president Bush se  begripsvermoë  en  president  Bush  en  mnr
Blair se rassisme omdat hulle die vent kwansuis ignoreer vanweë  Kofi  Annan
se velkleur, wil jy nou meer.

Hierdie uitsprake doen Suid-Afrika nie goed nie. Die  AEB  se  standpunt  is
dat as daar nou een stryd is waar ons ons moet uithou, is dit hierdie een  -
in Irak. Die groot aanklag van uni-terrorisme  van  VSA  se  kant  raak  ook
relatief as ons dink dat sy bondgenote nou al by die vyftig tel.

My laaste punt is die inkonsekwentheid  wat  die  meeste  pla.  Ons  het  'n
inkonsekwente buitelandse beleid. Dit gaan die verstand te  bowe  dat  Suid-
Afrika so heilig geroepe voel om Amerika te wys op multilateralisme, op  die
lyding en ontwrigting van oorlog, op internasionale reg,  maar  in  Zimbabwe
verbreek Suid-Afrika alle reëls van ware multilateralisme as  ons  deur  ons
troika, waarvan ons President deel is, die  Statebond  tandeloos  maak  teen
Mugabe. Die lyding van vroue en kinders, die ontwrigting van normale  lewens
in Zimbabwe tel vir die mindere, soverre Irak. In die  oordeel  op  die  VSA
beroep u op internasionale reg, maar as die regstaat  in  sy  wese  aangetas
word, dan swyg ons regering. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Often one gets the feeling that the Government's foreign policy  itself  is
characterised by a polarising ambivalence. On the  one  hand  there  is  the
realisation that South Africa's welfare, and that of Africa, depends on  the
countries of the free world; countries with a free  economy  and  sound  and
established democratic principles. These are countries on  which  we  depend
for trade and investments. On the other hand we find  the  old  ``struggle''
sentiments and the final loyalty is shown to those who used to  struggle  by
our side. This results in unilateral and vacillating action in  our  foreign
relations, for example Iraq.

The National Action is relieved that President Mbeki  has  scaled  down  the
ANC's anti-American rhetoric considerably since the outbreak of  the  second
Gulf War. We are pleased about that. Certain  statements  which  could  even
have been interpreted as pro-Saddam have put  our  country  at  great  risk.
Here we think especially of the fears of the ANC's  secretary-general  about
the USA attacking South Africa for our minerals, or the Minister of  Health,
who would  rather  buy  submarines  than  antiretrovirals  because  the  USA
apparently poses a greater danger to  South  Africa  than  Aids.  Yes,  even
former President Mandela's derogatory references to President Bush's  powers
of comprehension and President Bush and Mr Blair's racism because they  were
apparently ignoring Kofi Annan because of the colour of his skin, would  you
believe it.

These statements are detrimental to South Africa. The  AEB's  standpoint  is
that if there is one struggle that we must steer clear of, this is it  -  in
Iraq. The accusation of uni-terrorism on the part of the  USA  also  becomes
relative when we think of the fact that its  allies  now  amount  to  almost
fifty.

The last point is the inconsistency, which is the greatest concern. We  have
an inconsistent foreign policy. We cannot understand why South Africa  feels
called upon to make America aware of multilateralism, of the  suffering  and
disruption of war, of  international  law,  but  in  Zimbabwe  South  Africa
breaks all the rules of true multilateralism when, by means  of  our  troika
to which our President is  a  party,  we  make  the  Commonwealth  toothless
against Mugabe. The suffering of  women  and  children,  the  disruption  of
normal lives in Zimbabwe, is not deemed to be important as far  as  Iraq  is
concerned. In condemning the USA, international law  is  invoked,  but  when
the constitutional state is essentially  affected,  our  Government  remains
silent.]

The ANC, when commenting on the  United  States  and  Iraq,  declares  in  a
holier-than-thou manner that no country has the right  to  impose  a  regime
change on another. But when  one  dictator,  Robert  Mugabe,  illegally  and
through clearly witnessed  election  fraud  prevents  his  own  people  from
effecting a regime change, the  poor  MDC  is  blamed  for  the  failure  of
reconciliation talks because  they  had  the  audacity  to  challenge  these
fraudulent elections in court.

It is time that the realities of today and not the  loyalties  of  yesterday
determine our  international  relations.  South  Africa  is  regarded  as  a
respected member of the world community, as  our  popularity  at  very  full
international  events  clearly  shows.  Let  us   wear   that   crown   with
distinction, with integrity, with a sense of what is the right thing to  do.
[Interjections.]

Lastly, hon Minister, surely not the right thing to do was the way in  which
you treated the media at the recent meeting of the Pretoria Press Club.  You
are South Africa's chief diplomat but I must say that, from  what  we  could
see on television of your conduct, that was not silent  diplomacy  but  loud
animosity. Thank you. [Time expired.]

Dr Z P  JORDAN:  Deputy  Chairperson,  Comrade  Minister,  hon  members  and
comrades, I rise to speak in support of this Vote. I also want to thank  the
members of my committee and the hon  Minister  for  the  kind  words  spoken
about me from this podium during the course of this debate.

On Thursday, 20 March, I was among a group of guests who attended  a  parade
of the 19th Infantry Regiment of the SA National Defence Force at  its  base
just outside Khayelitsha. Six soldiers from that  regiment  received  medals
on that day, which marked the homecoming of SANDF personnel who  had  served
in the SA Protection Service detachment deployed in Burundi as one  of  many
confidence-building measures taken to restore peace and  stability  to  that
troubled land. Only one  amongst  the  troops  that  had  been  deployed  in
Burundi did not come home. He had lost his life in  an  unfortunate  bathing
accident. But, thankfully, not as a result of military engagement.

The safe return of our  troops  who  had  been  sent  to  a  sister  African
country, not as destabilising invaders, but as friends intent  on  assisting
our fellow Africans to re-establish the institutions  of  government,  bears
testimony to the changed role South Africa has assumed both  in  Africa  and
in international affairs. After nine years of  democracy  South  Africa  has
earned an honoured  place  among  the  nations  of  the  world  as  a  small
developing country, but one that punches way above its weight division.

During the past nine years this country, under the leadership  of  the  ANC-
led Government, has been accorded the honour of election as head of the Non-
Aligned Movement, has served as Chair of the Commonwealth and  is  currently
Chair of the  African  Union.  Only  the  churlish  would  deny  that  South
Africa's democratic Government has raised our  country  out  of  the  pariah
status it had earned under apartheid  and  won  recognition  as  a  valuable
member of the international community,  capable  of  offering  much  sought-
after advice to others, and blessed with leaders whose opinions  are  highly
considered in the corridors of power in every part of the world.

Since  1999,  South  Africa  has  played  host  to   two   important   world
conferences: the World Conference  Against  Racism,  Racial  Discrimination,
Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in 2001, followed by the World Summit  on
Sustainable Development in 2002. On both these occasions,  the  role  played
by our Department of Foreign Affairs,  under  the  able  stewardship  of  Dr
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, contributed to their success.

South  Africa  has  used  what  influence  it  has  to  help  transform  the
international bodies it has been ordered to lead. With the end of  the  Cold
War, many thought  that  the  Non-Aligned  Movement,  which  had  come  into
existence in the context of the Cold War, had lost its relevance  and  would
either collapse or slowly fade into oblivion.  Because  we  recognised  that
the Non-Aligned Movement was essentially an international body that  brought
together the developing nations of  the  world,  instead  of  allowing  that
movement to die, acting together with others, we helped to make it  relevant
to the issues of the 21st century.

Our chairmanship of  the  Commonwealth  offered  South  Africa  yet  another
opportunity to act together with others to  use  this  unique  forum,  where
countries of the developed North sit side by side as equals  with  countries
of the South to  collectively  strategise  about  solutions  to  the  modern
world's most pressing problems.
The opportunities for dialogue created  by  the  Commonwealth  had  been  of
great assistance in devising the measures that  are  required  to  turn  the
promise of the growing mutual interdependence of  nations  into  sustainable
solutions. Acting through the Commonwealth, the countries of the  South  and
the North have been able to adopt  mutually  acceptable  standards  of  good
governance and sustainable development and have agreed on  shared  goals  of
economic growth.

It is these experiences that convince us that in the world that has  emerged
from the  long  winter  of  the  Cold  War  multilateralism,  which  entails
translating  our  mutual  dependence  into  shared  responsibility  for  our
collective security and world peace, is the only viable way forward.

No one doubts that the nations of the world are  differentially  endowed  in
terms of wealth, military power and,  consequently,  influence  and  esteem.
But I would submit that  the  history  of  the  past  two  centuries,  which
witnessed bloodletting and killing on  a  scale  our  ancestors  would  have
thought unimaginable, should serve as a warning that it would  be  wiser  to
employ humanity's present-day productive capacity for our mutual  upliftment
rather than for our mutual destruction.
At no other time in human history has  humanity's  ingenuity  developed  the
capacity to produce enough food to feed the hungry and banish the threat  of
starvation that has haunted past generations. At  no  other  time  in  human
history has human ingenuity evolved the capacity to produce the plenty  that
could eradicate poverty and want from the planet. At no other time in  human
history has humanity's capacity for invention made possible the  realisation
of the age-old dream of a society in which every  human  being  is  properly
housed and clothed. Yet, at this very  time,  millions,  not  only  in  sub-
Saharan Africa, but in many parts of the world,  go  to  bed  hungry,  their
bodies  ravaged  by  preventable  diseases,  in  pitiable  hovels  that  are
incapable of protecting them against the elements.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development, which South  Africa  hosted  in
2002, quite correctly identified the struggle to eradicate poverty and  want
as one of the key elements of a platform of truly  sustainable  development.
That  Johannesburg  summit  was  notable  not  only  for  the   breadth   of
participation, but also for the programme  it  had  adopted,  with  specific
targets and timeframes for their realisation.

It is a matter of record that South Africa was among the countries that  led
the charge for  the  adoption  of  that  programme.  The  contribution  this
country is making for the realisation of a better world may strike  some  as
undue attention to matters far from home. But in a world in which the  smoke
stacks in the state of Indiana in the USA, in the Ruhr  valley  of  Germany,
in the Ukraine, in Tientsin in China and  in  the  industrial  heartland  of
Japan can result in global warming, it is only the wilfully blind who  would
insist that these matters have no place on our national agenda.

The World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination,  Xenophobia  and
Related Forms of Intolerance  was  ridiculed  as  an  extravagant  waste  of
taxpayers' money by some in this very House. These ill-considered words  had
barely left their mouths when the terrible  and  ugly  face  of  intolerance
showed itself in the terrorist attacks on the Twin Towers of  New  York.  It
is an indictment of the puerile myopia of some of the political  leaders  in
our country that  it  requires  such  terrifying  events  to  sharpen  their
vision.

It is equally saddening that so many of our world's leaders appear  to  have
derived purely negative lessons from that experience.  It  is  a  matter  of
profound regret that a sense of siege appears to  have  taken  hold  amongst
many of the developed countries of the North.  Even  the  United  States  of
America, a country that owes its prosperity and power  to  successive  waves
of immigrants from various parts of the world,  has  turned  inward  and  is
adopting a fortress mentality that spurns the apparent outsider.  Worse  yet
is the attitude that has taken root  in  a  number  of  European  countries,
where some immigrant groups are not merely rejected but  even  characterised
as unassimilable by their host countries.

The phenomenal rise of xenophobia affects South  Africa  in  equal  measure.
This hostility towards foreigners  is  doubly  regrettable  in  our  country
because it targets immigrants from  the  African  continent  more  than  any
other group. Amongst the responsibilities  our  Government  must  assume  is
that of educating the South African public about the  sterling  contribution
African immigrants are making to this country.

One will find many African immigrants  staffing  faculties  in  our  leading
universities. One will also find them in  vital  scientific  and  industrial
research institutions and amongst other professions. South Africans must  be
taught to shed the negative  image  of  African  immigrants  as  problematic
druglords and fraudsters or as sources of cheap labour who are  taking  food
out of the mouths of deserving South Africans.

Globalisation, like so many new developments in the lives of nations, has  a
dual character. On the one hand, it has made the world a much smaller  place
by linking  its  far-flung  quarters  through  means  of  near-instantaneous
communication and trade. But its bounty has  not  been  distributed  equally
among the nations of  the  world.  Far  too  many  people  are  experiencing
globalisation as yet another instance of the  strong  acquiring  power  over
the weak. Yet, if differently managed and  controlled,  globalisation  could
be turned to great advantage  precisely  by  the  weak  and  the  poor.  The
revolution in telecommunications could make it  possible  for  a  developing
country lacking medical and health expertise to access  the  skills  of  the
best-trained physicians and surgeons  of  another  country  that  is  better
endowed.

A rational division of labour  could  make  it  possible  for  a  developing
country to produce components for industrial processing in another  country,
to their mutual benefit,  and  vice  versa.  Mutually  beneficial  synergies
between developed countries and developing countries that do not entail  the
exploitation of the labour force of the latter  are  now  possible,  as  are
synergies amongst  developing  countries  themselves.  In  the  World  Trade
Organisation and UN Commission on Trade and Development,  South  Africa  has
sought to galvanise developing countries for collective action in  order  to
turn globalisation to our advantage.

The international political environment created by  the  US-UK  invasion  of
Iraq underscores the urgency of the challenges  facing  Africa.  As  Comrade
President Thabo Mbeki has remarked,  this  invasion  has  pushed  Nepad  and
indeed all other programmes  for  the  upliftment  of  the  peoples  of  the
developing  countries  further  down  on  the  international  agenda.   This
increases the likelihood that Africa will have  to  fall  back  on  its  own
resources to translate Nepad into a meaningful programme.

As the powerhouse of African economic growth, an unequal  burden  will  fall
on South Africa  in  such  an  eventuality.  I  remain  confident  that  our
Government will win the support of all parties represented  in  this  august
House when South Africa is called upon to assume such responsibilities.

We have often said that peace and stability on  the  African  continent  are
essential for economic  growth  and  the  upliftment  of  her  peoples.  Our
Department of Foreign Affairs is playing a role second to none  in  striving
for peace. It is going to be important for South Africa to persuade all  the
major political players on the continent that politics  is  not  a  zero-sum
game in which one winner can only win if the other loses.

The peer review  mechanism  of  the  AU  and  Nepad  will  be  an  important
instrument to win acceptance of this principle  amongst  African  countries.
Like peace and stability, democracy and good  governance  are  developmental
issues.  Africa  waged  a  century-long  struggle  against  colonialism  and
apartheid precisely to establish the principle ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I'm trying to help you  because
some of the colleagues are continuing with their own debates. Carry on,  hon
member.

Dr Z P JORDAN: Good  governance  and  democracy  are  developmental  issues.
Africa waged a  century-long  struggle  against  colonialism  and  apartheid
precisely  to  establish  the  principle  that  governments  should   derive
legitimacy through the consent of the  government.  Democratic  institutions
are therefore not privileges  that  may  be  extended  or  withheld  at  the
discretion of those who wield power. They are an entitlement, a  right  that
the people of this continent waged struggles to  attain  and  won  at  great
cost.

In the ANC's continued interaction with the political parties  in  Zimbabwe,
we have warned against the subversion of the rule of law, as we  have  about
the heightening of political  tension.  We  have  warned  also  against  the
temptations of recklessness that could easily precipitate armed conflict.

It is a matter of public record that the ANC and  the  Government  it  leads
have done these things. Yet the opposition prefers pretending that  we  have
not. It is important to emphasise, once  again,  that  diplomacy  entails  a
dialogue with the sovereign government of another country.  Its  purpose  is
to persuade, not to coerce one's interlocutor to change his behaviour.

The manner in which one conducts that dialogue is determined by the  results
one hopes to achieve. If one's purpose is persuasion, it  serves  no  useful
purpose to adopt a hectoring and bullying  tone.  If  one's  purpose  is  to
achieve  communication,  shouting  and  extravagant  posturing  could   well
undermine that purpose. It  is  a  patent  absurdity  to  accuse  the  South
African Government of quiet diplomacy because  diplomacy  is,  by  its  very
nature, quiet. If, however, one's purpose is  to  intimidate  and  browbeat,
that too will determine one's conduct.

While we were  admiring  the  brave  men  and  women  of  the  SANDF's  19th
Regiment, in another part of the world other soldiers were being  sent  into
battle. Unlike the soldiers of our 19th Regiment, quite a  number  of  those
will never see their homes again. South Africa was among the  member  states
of the United Nations who sought to  achieve  the  disarmament  of  Iraq  by
peaceful means. Mr Dumisani Khumalo, our ambassador to the  United  Nations,
acting on behalf of both the AU  and  the  Non-Aligned  Movement,  played  a
distinguished role in that effort. But  as  matters  progressed,  after  the
first report made by Dr Hans Blix and his team in December 2002,  it  became
increasingly clear that  the  United  States  and  Britain  were  intent  on
military action.

The United States made its intention clear from the onset.  If  it  did  not
receive a UN mandate, it would  proceed  with  those  countries  willing  to
follow its lead. The question we have  to  ask  is:  Is  the  United  States
administration's attitude to the United Nations captured in the  remarks  of
Mr Richard Perle, one of Vice President  Cheney's  principal  advisers,  who
recently called it, I quote: ``That chatterbox on the Hudson''? He  went  on
to say: ``What will die is the fantasy of the UN as a foundation  of  a  new
world order,  the  liberal  conceit  of  safety  through  international  law
administered by international institutions.''

Britain had striven hard to win a UN mandate, but having failed to  convince
the majority of members of the  United  Nations  Security  Council,  Britain
deceitfully chose to reinterpret United Nations Security Council  Resolution
1441. The Charter of the United Nations is unambiguous on this matter.

The United States' claims  that  Iraq  poses  an  imminent  threat  to  that
country are unconvincing. The  British  foreign  Minister  even  stooped  to
plagiarism to find justification for this dangerous course  of  action.  The
actions of these two countries amount to an abrogation  of  multilateralism,
a  subversion  of  the  United  Nations  and  could  well  be  a  breach  of
international will.

As one has warned on previous occasions ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired. [Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: This is 20 minutes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: It's 18 minutes.

Dr Z P JORDAN: No, 20 minutes! Definitely 20!

Hon MEMBERS: Twenty!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Let me just check with the  Table.  Is
it 20 minutes? ... [Interjections.] ... Eighteen minutes? [Interjections.]
Dr Z P JORDAN: Eighteen minutes? [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon member.

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Thank you, Deputy Chair. I  would  like  to
thank all the hon members who have participated in the debate and those  who
have listened to the debate.

I'll just say a few words  in  response,  probably  starting  with  the  hon
member Colin Eglin. Indeed, I agree with him on what he said about  the  war
and  its   unpredictability   and   the   centrality   of   multilateralism.
Unfortunately, he went on to say that President Mbeki  has  failed  to  play
his multilateral role within the Commonwealth.

Let me just explain that the mandate given to the  troika  was  very  clear.
The troika was given a mandate to look at  Zimbabwe  in  relation  to  those
elections in relation to the Commonwealth  report,  to  assist  Zimbabwe  in
resolving the problems in the country. After their first  meeting  they  had
to review, after a year. They met in London; they agreed on  the  suspension
of Zimbabwe from the councils and they agreed on the other areas of work.

And then after six months, suddenly, the chair of the troika calls  them  to
review the situation in Zimbabwe. The mandate was to review  after  a  year.
Of course, because South Africa and Nigeria wanted to  act  in  good  faith,
they went to the meeting held after six months. They  held  discussions  and
two of them said, ``We must  continue  with  the  efforts  in  Zimbabwe  and
review after a year as we were mandated.'' One, the chair,  did  not  agree.
And the chair of  the  troika  took  it  upon  himself  to  go  to  a  press
conference and say that this is his position and  the  others  must  explain
their position.

Now, who is failing to  keep  the  multilateralism  and  democracy  in  that
troika? Who is failing? But, of  course,  unfortunately,  hon  member  Colin
Eglin, probably acting on behalf of his party, is unable to criticise  Prime
Minister Howard for failing, because  it  is  very  clear  who  failed  that
effort of the troika. [Applause.]

Now I don't know whether it's his ability not to understand - and I'm  quite
sure it's not, because Colin Eglin, we know, is a bright  person.  Maybe  it
is a problem of not being able  to  criticise  another  white  person.  It's
possible. [Interjections.] It's possible. But, Mr Colin Eglin  must  explain
to us why he is unable to say it was wrong for the chairman  of  the  troika
to take that position. No person who chairs any  committee  and  behaves  in
that way will have it considered acceptable. So he must explain to  us  why,
instead of saying it's President Mbeki  who  failed  to  behave  within  the
troika.

So, let's come to Zimbabwe. We've always said that when we don't agree  with
Zimbabwe we tell them, and we've said it in public. What we  have  not  done
is to condemn. As a Foreign Minister my duty is not to condemn; my  duty  is
to  build  bridges,  to  dialogue,  to  persuade.  It's  not   to   condemn.
Criticising and condemning are two different things. I've  not  condemned  a
single country. I talk, I dialogue, I persuade,  I  negotiate.  That  is  my
duty and it's going to remain  like  that  as  long  as  I  am  the  Foreign
Minister of this country. [Applause.]

And it is for that reason  that  South  Africa  is  actually  enjoying  good
relations with all the countries in the North and in  the  South;  poor  and
rich. It is because we don't go around condemning. And  that  is  why  South
Africa is not about to go to war  with  anyone;  because  when  you  go  war
you've failed in terms of diplomacy. [Applause.]

But, there are lots of situations in the world. If  the  opposition  decides
that they want  to  go  around  condemning,  it's  fine.  They  are  in  the
opposition, they have that luxury. But it's a pity that they  only  can  see
as far as Zimbabwe. We've got so much suffering in  the  world.  I've  never
heard him say one word about the Palestinians. [Applause.]  I  haven't  even
heard him say anything about  the  coup  that  happened  two  weeks  ago.  I
haven't  heard  anything  said  about  the  suffering  of  the   Palestinian
children. I haven't heard one word. Maybe he can only  see  up  to  Zimbabwe
and his horizons are not broad enough. I don't know.

But, I think, unfortunately, for  many  members  in  the  opposition,  their
feared nightmare is  the  resolution  of  the  Zimbabwean  problem,  because
they'll have nothing to say. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: You know us better than that, Dr  Zuma.  You  know  us  better
than that.
The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: I know. I  know  you  better  than  anybody
else and I can talk with authority because I know you. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon  members,  we  can't
have a running commentary. You can make an interjection, but  no  more  than
that. Hon Minister, carry on.

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Hon  Koos  apologised  as  he  has  had  to
leave, so maybe I will answer him when I do meet him at some stage.

Coming to some of the comments made by hon Geldenhuys,  of  course  I  agree
with a lot of what he has said, just like I agree with a  lot  of  what  hon
Colin Eglin said. But of course I must say that, as I have said, we are  not
anti any country. We are not anti-America. We are not pro-Saddam Hussein  in
this conflict. But we have to uphold the principles of the  United  Nations.
We have to uphold the principle of solving  problems  through  dialogue.  We
have to uphold the principle of trying, as much as we can,  to  protect  the
present and future generations from the scourge of war.
So, it is not  an  anti-American  stance.  It's  a  stance  for  peace,  for
peaceful negotiations and for  peaceful  disarmament.  We  agree  completely
with the Americans, just as we agree with  everybody  else  and  as  the  UN
Security Council has said, there must be disarmament. But indeed we did  not
agree that there was a need for war in  pursuit  of  that  disarmament.  And
therefore I would just like to assure you that we are not  anti-American  at
all. But of course, where we differ with America, we will differ. There  are
no two countries that will always agree. We  have  our  own  principles,  we
have our own philosophy and we have our own respect  for  international  law
and therefore at times we will differ with any country.

Coming to the other speakers from the UDM and so on,  a  lot  of  what  they
have said, really, I agree with, about Nepad.  Hon  Mulder,  what  you  said
about Nepad we agree with. We don't agree that we are in a  Cold  War  mode.
We are not, but we don't  follow  any  country  blindly.  We  have  our  own
independent  thinking  and  we  follow  our  own   independent   principles.
[Applause.]

On the question that Nepad will depend on us, as Africans, I couldn't  agree
more. Indeed it will depend on us and everybody else will come  in  if  they
think we are serious and we will succeed.

On the sale of property, the property that's  being  sold  is  not  property
that is being sold to augment our budget. In  any  case,  whatever  we  sell
goes to the Treasury; it doesn't come  to  us.  So  we  are  not  trying  to
balance the books. Just to give you two examples: One  of  the  houses  that
needs to be sold used to be a residence in the Bophuthatswana homeland  when
we were pretending in South Africa that Bophuthatswana  was  a  country.  We
had  a  mission  there  representing  Bophuthatswana   and   there   is   an
ambassadorial residence there and we think it needs to be sold  so  that  we
can be able to buy other residences.

The other residence, for instance, is our residence in Bonn.  As  you  know,
the capital moved from Bonn to Berlin, so we had to have a new residence  in
Berlin. The one in Bonn is no longer necessary. So those  are  the  type  of
properties that we are trying to  sell.  And  we  are  hoping  that  we  can
persuade the Treasury to give us money in lieu also to buy  properties.  So,
I just wanted to assure hon members on that.

And then on the question of what hon Geldenhuys raised about whites  in  the
department, it is not altogether true that whites can no longer move to  any
higher position than they were in before. Of  course,  there  is  lots  more
competition now because it is open to everybody, whereas in the past it  was
just them. But it is not true. We have had promotions of white people  which
we can give you to show you that they do move up. But it's  true  that  they
won't move as easily as they did before and it's only to  be  expected,  not
because they are white - why should it  be  because  they  are  white?  It's
because there is more competition. There are people who were not allowed  to
compete for those posts who are now allowed to compete. [Applause.]

And then on the question of the vacancies, it is true that  there  are  some
vacancies that are not filled. There are  a  number  of  reasons  for  that.
Firstly, there is a process that's taking place within Government, in  which
there's a moratorium on filling posts, which is  supposed  to  go  on  until
June, after which, hopefully, that process will be over and  the  moratorium
will be lifted.

Secondly, even when the moratorium is lifted, we probably won't be  able  to
fill all the posts, simply because we don't have enough  in  the  budget  to
fill all those posts. So we will fill some, but we'll still not be  able  to
fill all of them because, as you have all said, hon members, if we  were  to
fill all 800 posts we would not be able to have an  operational  budget.  We
would just be paying salaries and with all the work  that  we  have  to  do,
that won't be possible.

So I thought I would just respond and say thank you very much once  more.  I
enjoyed the debate and I regret that I'm not able to be at home  more  often
to engage in the debate ...

Mr M J ELLIS: Hear, hear!

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: ... including talking to you.

Mr M J ELLIS: The good old days!

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Thank you very much. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

                 FOOD RELIEF ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mrs R R JOEMAT: Madam Speaker and hon members. Madam Deputy Speaker, I  want
to put on a record that all the members and the  parties  in  the  committee
agreed it was not necessary to debate this  Bill.  But  I  suppose  the  hon
member Taljaard must be confused again.

The  ANC  supports  the  Bill  before  us.  The  Food   Relief   Adjustments
Appropriation Bill is a special adjustment to appropriate  additional  funds
for the requirements  of  the  Department  of  Social  Development  and  the
Department of Foreign Affairs, in respect of the 2002-03 financial year.

The Department of Social Development will receive an amount of R230  million
to fund the implementation of domestic food  relief  in  the  form  of  food
parcels. The Department of Foreign Affairs will receive an  amount  of  R170
million. These funds will be transferred to the World Food  Programme.  This
will honour the commitment made by  our  Government  to  donate  a  100  000
metric tons of maize to  countries  in  the  SADC  region.  The  World  Food
Programme will set up the delivery mechanisms and the necessary criteria  to
identify the SADC countries that will benefit from these funds.

The rich can afford to leave a country when conditions in a country are  not
favourable, but it is the poor that remain behind  and  bear  the  brunt  of
poverty. We, the ANC-led Government, will reach out a helping  hand  to  our
brothers and sisters in Africa. South Africa will continue to  act  as  part
of the international  collective  to  encourage  dialogue  amongst  all  the
political and other role-players  in  Africa  in  an  effort  to  create  an
environment conducive to reconciliation and reconstruction and development.

Development and co-operation with countries  in  Africa  forms  an  integral
part of South Africa's foreign policy. Technical and  financial  assistance,
especially to  SADC  countries,  is  regarded  as  a  major  instrument  for
promoting economic development, peace and stability on a regional basis.  It
is within this  context  that  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  offers
development, co-operation and assistance to SADC countries.
We live in a  world  driven  by  science  and  technology.  To  enhance  our
development capacity,  we  need  to  increase  investment  in  research  and
development within the SADC regions. This will assist  us  to  achieve  high
productivity  levels  and  make  us   competitive   in   the   international
marketplace. We should also spend more on  research  and  development.  But,
for some SADC countries, this is a luxury to have on their budget. There  is
very little money that is spent on research and development. More  resources
need to be  mobilised  from  Government  and  the  private  sector  to  fund
research and development. We are  more  fortunate  than  some  of  the  SADC
countries and, therefore, we do not turn our heads. We will  reach  out  and
help.

The birth of the ANC started in the hearts and minds of  the  poor  and  the
oppressed. The  Freedom  Charter  says,  "The  people  shall  share  in  the
country's wealth". So, we come from poverty, and we know what it  is  to  be
poor. Our major constituencies represent the poor. To the DA/DP  elite:  You
analyse, romanticise, become experts on the poor, even speak  on  behalf  of
the poor, and write papers on poverty, but where is your action?

In the Bible, there is a saying, "If someone  has  nothing  in  his  or  her
stomach, how can you say, -`go in peace'?" I want to invite the  DA  and  DP
elite to come and experience poverty, where it is normal for a neighbour  to
borrow a cup of sugar, or six slices of bread until Friday, hoping that  the
father will bring some wages home, or when there is a knock  on  your  door,
and a woman asks you for chicken giblets, or chicken skins, so that she  can
make some food for her children.

In the early 1970s, the Christian Institute under Comrade Beyers  Naudé  had
a community awareness project to develop  an  understanding  of  and  to  be
sensitive to the  plight  of  the  poor.  As  comrades  and  volunteers,  we
received R5,00 for the weekend to survive. We were then dropped in  poverty-
stricken areas, and had to make contact and communicate with the  community,
and find shelter with families for the weekend. The comrades would  then  be
picked up on Sunday afternoon to relate their experiences.

In consultation with the community, we had to identify  projects  to  assist
these communities. Most of our experiences amounted  to  the  fact  that  we
never knew how hard it is to be poor. But we also discovered that those  who
have little still share the little that they have. I  recommend  to  the  DA
and the DP to go into such programmes.

As the Minister stated, these amounts appropriated in  this  Bill  were  not
allocated to a particular department at the time of the  adjustment  budget,
because  the  relevant  departments  were  still  investigating  appropriate
interventions through interdepartmental technical committees.  The  findings
of these committees were taken into account, and  the  domestic  food  needs
will be in the form  of  food  parcels,  and  will  be  distributed  through
nongovernmental organisations and community-based  organisations.  The  food
parcels will provide direct assistance to the most destitute and  vulnerable
groups within our communities.

These  additional  funds  will  enhance  and  add  to  the  existing  social
assistance provided by the Department of  Social  Development  that  manages
the  poverty  relief  programmes  for  the  provinces.  The  poverty  relief
programmes target vulnerable groups,  namely  women,  children,  youth,  the
elderly, and people with disabilities.

As our President stated in his speech on  the  opening  of  Parliament  this
year:


  ... the Government must act to ensure that we reduce the number of people
  dependent on social welfare, increasing the numbers that rely  for  their
  livelihood on normal participation in the  economy.  This  is  especially
  relevant to the accomplishment of the goal of enhancing  the  dignity  of
  every South African.

Therefore, it is  important  to  integrate  the  capacities  of  the  people
dependent on these grants, and to integrate them  into  the  poverty  relief
programmes and ensure that these projects generate an income.

Poverty strips our people of their dignity. No family should live  on  hand-
outs and hope it will be there tomorrow  again.  Parents  must  be  able  to
provide for the basic needs of the family, and do it with  pride,  integrity
and dignity. The ANC will continue to ensure a better life  for  all.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Deputy Speaker and colleagues, I can assure  the  hon  Joemat
that the DA does visit the poor, and they  certainly  do  not  go  there  in
their 4x4s or wearing their Gucci suits, like  the  hon  Tony  Yengeni  did.
[Interjections.]

The DA supports this Bill. However, there are  areas  in  which  we  have  a
number of difficulties. Firstly, in respect of the     R230  million  to  be
distributed domestically, there is a great degree of  concern  that  despite
the decision to make food relief available, there was  not  greater  clarity
about the lead  department,  the  distribution  mechanism  or  criteria  for
eligibility to be applied in administering this programme.

This was clear in the deliberations  of  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  last
year, when the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement was tabled. The  fact  is
that such detail has not been  forthcoming  since  November  last  year  and
there has been, therefore, a hold-up  in  the  distribution  of  much-needed
relief. This is unacceptable.

When policy decisions are made by Cabinet, even in cases of  emergency,  the
systems and structures for something as material as food assistance must  be
worked out at the same time. Lags of months are unacceptable, as  every  day
that ticks by is a  day  of  relief  foregone.  This  while  private  sector
players  and  retailers  have  announced  and  implemented,  with  immediate
effect, a degree of subsidisation on basic foodstuffs and cut prices.

The answers by  National  Treasury,  before  the  portfolio  committee  this
morning, that areas hardest hit by drought and the price hikes in food  will
be targeted based on a poverty map  still  to  be  developed  by  Statistics
South Africa are unacceptable. We trust  that  details  on  the  eligibility
criteria and distribution mechanism for these food relief  parcels  will  be
provided to  Parliament's  finance,  social  development  and  Joint  Budget
Committees forthwith.

We cannot merely appropriate money and not be provided with details  of  how
the programmes are to function on the ground. Secondly, in relation  to  the
R170 million destined for SADC, via the World  Food  Programme,  one  cannot
ignore the fact that many of the food crises are not merely  the  result  of
bad weather, climate change and drought. Bad policies, bad  people  and  bad
politics all play their part.

As Mr James T Morris, director of the UN World Food Programme  said  in  his
testimony before the US Congress in February, and I quote:


  ... there are four immediate triggers for large-scale  food  emergencies.
  Most recent crises have been fuelled by a combination of  these  factors:
  failing economic policies, political and  ethnic  violence,  Aids  and  a
  sharp rise in natural disasters.

The World Food Programme is currently projecting that  up  to  14,4  million
people are likely to be affected by the  food  crisis  in  Southern  Africa,
with nearly half of the population of Zimbabwe at risk of starvation.  While
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia are  all  affected,  there
is no doubt that Zimbabwe is the worst afflicted.

While  we  support  the  humanitarian  aid  in  this  Bill,  South  Africa's
Government has much to account for in respect of  its  policy  in  Zimbabwe,
where 6,7 million people face starvation, consumed by the fire  and  ire  of
the tyrant. [Interjections.]

In referring to Zimbabwe ... [Interjections.]  Of  course,  we  do.  If  you
doubt that, you are mad. In referring to Zimbabwe, as  the  greatest  source
of alarm in the region, Mr Morris said,


  It is not our place  to  judge  the  merits  of  land  redistribution  in
  Zimbabwe or elsewhere. But  the  scheme  now  operating  in  Zimbabwe  is
  damaging. Thousands of productive farms have been put out  of  commission
  and food output will be a mere 40% of normal levels this year.


  This scheme, along with restrictions on private sector food marketing and
  a monopoly on food imports by the Government's Grain Marketing Board  are
  turning a drought that  might  have  been  managed  into  a  humanitarian
  nightmare. More than half of Zimbabwe's 12 million people are now  living
  with the threat of starvation.

In March, the IMF stated that concerns  over  governance  issues,  pervasive
price controls, chaotic land reforms and the grain marketing  monopoly  have
contributed to Zimbabwe's crisis, and there is no doubt that our policy  has
contributed as well.

It is clear from events in Zimbabwe that food is being used as a  weapon  in
domestic politics, and the World Food Programme has  had  to  suspend  local
food distribution in Zimbabwe twice due to political interference.  This  is
a further crime being perpetrated against the people of Zimbabwe.

While it is true that a  post-Iraq  reconstruction  will  pose  yet  further
possible demands on the prospective food  and  famine  fund  which  will  be
established with US and G8 money in Evian in France in  June,  it  is  quite
clear that it will take concerted efforts for Africa to  show  how,  through
Nepad and the AU, it will  seek  to  address  the  four  triggers  for  food
crises, highlighted above by Mr Morris before Congress.

Dealing decisively with food security issues will take a far more  concerted
effort, requiring political will and not only R170 million. [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Deputy Speaker, when  the  R400  million  was  announced
last year, my party, firstly through our Ministers who are in  the  Cabinet,
agreed, and when it was announced through the MTEF, the  party  as  a  whole
supported the  food  distributions  as  a  wholly  and  totally  appropriate
humanitarian response to people both within the country and  people  in  our
neighbouring states who are suffering and who are without food.

We do see the situation as largely  situational,  that  it's  not  something
that will happen every year, but it's  very  much  largely  due  to  weather
conditions and, as I say, the response was entirely the correct response.

Moving to today's Bill, seeing as this is to simply formalise  the  decision
and give effect to the adjustment to the budget,  we  have  no  problem.  We
support the Bill. Going forward, we are aware that some of these  programmes
are fairly advanced in their distribution.

We would then state our expectations of the two departments  concerned,  the
Departments of Foreign  Affairs  and  of  Social  Development,  to  continue
monitoring the distributions and to ensure that they do, indeed,  reach  the
target constituencies. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Deputy Speaker  and  hon  members,  the  Medium  Term
Budget Policy Statement of 2002 announced the intention of the  Minister  of
Finance to make available       R400 million per year, over the  next  three
years, for food relief programmes.

Since then, the Department of Social Development has been  identified  as  a
line-function authority to implement these programmes in  co-operation  with
other Government departments. An interdepartmental technical  committee  was
set up to make proposals regarding the distribution of food parcels.

In May 2002, the UDM had already proposed a food parcel system for  targeted
groups in our  communities.  It  had  also  proposed  utilising  major  food
retailers and other retail outlets in the  rural  areas  to  assist  in  the
distribution of food parcels, using a contact list smart card  system.  Such
a card would contain basic centralised data to control the  issuing  of  all
food parcels to targeted individuals and would also eliminate  all  possible
forms of fraud, corruption and duplication.

What  is  therefore  needed  to  successfully  implement   a   food   parcel
distribution programme in South Africa,  is  a  well-thought-through  system
with identified target groups and  effective  card  distribution  mechanism,
and the active involvement of  both  the  private  sector  as  well  as  the
Government.

We will support the funding of the implementation of food relief  programmes
and we would urge the Minister responsible for  the  line  function,  namely
the Minister of Social Development, to  develop  an  effective  distribution
system, including  criteria,  role-players  and  a  workable  implementation
master plan.

The UDM supports the Food Relief Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill.  I  thank
you.

Mrs R M  SOUTHGATE:  Thank  you,  Deputy  Speaker.  The  ACDP  supports  the
additional allocations. However, we hope that the families, at  the  end  of
the day, will enjoy the primary focus of these particular allocations.

We just would like to say that the social problem,  obviously,  is  plaguing
our communities; and that is the problem of  unemployment.  Definitely,  the
violence is adding to this and aggravating the situation, and we  feel  that
because of the gang violence, also, it is putting  a  lot  of  hardships,  I
believe, on the family. [Interjections.] Danny, let me  please  complete  my
debate.

The food relief of approximately R400 million is only  a  direct  short-term
plan to address issues of severe hunger and deprivation in our  communities.
However,  we  do  acknowledge  that  the  chief  challenge  that  faces  our
communities is definitely  sustainability  and,  obviously,  the  fact  that
there is no employment. That makes it very difficult.

One concern  that  we  do  have  is  that  food  parcels  must  reach  their
legitimate beneficiaries. What we do know and  what  we  have  seen  in  our
community is that prominent Ministers are actually handing  out  these  food
parcels,  and  we  are  gravely  concerned  because  it   seems   they   are
politicising this particular event. [Interjections.]

Yes, Madam  Speaker.  It  seems  that  the  ANC  is  grandstanding  in  this
particular event, and I would caution the ANC against that because  we  have
seen that it creates a lot of mayhem in the  communities  and  you  are  not
able to control it. What we are saying is that the bodies which are able  to
do that are the NGOs and the church organisations. [Interjections.]

So, I just hope that the ANC will heed this caution. Thank you.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker, we in the UCDP know that no man  can  be  a
patriot on an empty stomach. With poverty so  rife  and  people  finding  it
difficult to eke out a living, the legitimacy of the Government  has  to  be
proven by each doing whatever the communities need to  have  done;  in  this
case, the provision of food relief.

We maintain that the measure should be only for relief, while other  efforts
are made to ensure that the dignity of the people is restored,  by  creating
a conducive climate for more jobs. People need to  earn  a  living  and  not
depend on hand-outs, regardless of who offers them.

The UCDP believes that true freedom cannot exist without  economic  security
and independence. People should not be dependent  on  Government  for  their
daily  livelihood.  The  NGOs  so  selected  should   be   broad-based   and
nonpartisan. As matters stand now, most NGOs are not as independent as  they
should be, and tend to further the interests of the  party  that  holds  the
purse strings and, invariably, there will be a tendency to  cater  for  some
and not others.

We propose that a greater  portion  of  the  food  relief  be  allocated  to
churches because they minister to all people, regardless of  their  standing
in the community.

We, in the UCDP, call on the Government to assist in  creating  a  wholesome
atmosphere for investments, and  thus  have  more  job  opportunities  where
people can earn their living without necessarily being given  these  things.
I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Poverty is  the  root  cause  of
our socioeconomic instability. Statistics show that a  large  percentage  of
our people live below the poverty  line,  and  it  is  surprising  how  they
survive.

Minimal resources hinder improving conditions, but  improvements  have  been
made. Starvation is by no means the way to die. The biggest problem is  that
the reality of the situation is not only an epidemic  for  the  Republic  of
South Africa, but for Africa as a whole.  We  have  to,  within  our  means,
assist the overcoming of this situation.

The appropriation of R230 million to the Department of  Social  Development,
in respect of the 2003-04 financial  year,  to  fund  domestic  food  relief
intervention is supported by the MF.

We cannot watch our nation starve and suffer. We must  do  what  we  can  to
overcome poverty  and  attain  sustainable  development.  The  work  of  the
Department of Foreign Affairs, in the light of the  SADC  region,  has  been
extremely crucial.

South Africa has a larger responsibility to the  larger  entity  of  Africa.
The efforts in assisting in food relief for countries within  these  regions
are supported by the MF. Thus, the appropriated amount of  R170  million  to
the department in this respect is understood.

The MF supports the Food Relief Adjustments Appropriation Bill.  [Applause.]


The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Speaker, there is actually  very  little  to
say because I think the debate is misplaced. The issues were dealt  with  in
the committee and it was supported. I am not quite sure why we are  debating
this, save that some individual opted to use the time  to  demonstrate  that
she is too clever by half. But, it is by half because I think she  fails  to
understand that the R170 million will  be  distributed  to  the  World  Food
Programme and they will undertake responsibility. It is not  the  Government
that gets involved in this. The stories that are told and  retold,  I  think
people found from some funny website, because  the  World  Food  Programme's
approach to food distribution and their own role  is  quite  different  from
what the hon Taljaard told us here. [Interjections.]

Sorry.  You  Rhodesians  must  stop  whingeing  in  this  House,  you  know.
[Laughter.] You must stop whingeing because Rhodesia will never  come  back,
so listen. [Interjections.]

In respect of the distribution, it is being done in partnership  with  NGOs.
The launch happened in Bekkersdal on the West  Rand,  but  essentially  this
programme is being undertaken by the provinces  in  partnership  with  NGOs.
Those NGOs are wellknown, and Government is not  directly  involved  in  the
distribution itself.

In respect of what the hon Rajbally said, it  is  not  for  the  new  fiscal
year. It is for the fiscal year which ends on 31 March.

Let me express appreciation again  to  all  those  who  contributed  to  the
discussion in the committee this morning. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a first time.

                 FOOD RELIEF ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Speaker, I will be very short  in  this  debate.  There
was consensus, actually. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, on a point of order:  I  think,  for
the record, we are dealing with the Gold and  Foreign  Exchange  Contingency
Reserve Account Defrayal Bill.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I think the Minister is correct.  In
fact, there  is  no  list  of  speakers  for  the  Food  Relief  Adjustments
Appropriation Bill.

There was no debate.

Bill read a second time.

     GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTINGENCY RESERVE ACCOUNT DEFRAYAL BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr K A MOLOTO: Madam Speaker, as I have indicated, I will be very  short  in
this debate. There was actually consensus among most political  parties  not
to debate this Bill.

There is just so much going well for this country. We have  made  tremendous
progress within  just  nine  years  under  the  leadership  of  the  popular
liberation movement of our people, the ANC.
These  achievements  are  unheard  of  and  unparalleled.  Most   developing
countries are still struggling to build the sound economic  fundamentals  we
have  in  this  country.  We  always  believe  that  these  sound   economic
fundamentals will impact positively on the  performance  of  the  rand,  and
therefore it is very important that everybody in  this  House,  irrespective
of political affiliation, should be proud of these achievements.

This Bill should therefore be understood within the context of  Government's
efforts to close down the forward book and let commercial banks  play  their
rightful or traditional role of offering  risk  management  tools  to  their
clients in conducting businesses.

Members would ask what these forward contracts  are.  A  forward  or  future
contract is simply an agreement in which a  buyer  and  a  seller  agree  to
conclude a transaction at a predetermined time in  the  future  at  a  price
agreed upon today. Commercial banks normally  facilitate  the  inclusion  of
these contracts. Losses and gains are either suffered  or  realised  by  the
seller or buyer in the process.

The other question would be: How does the South  African  Reserve  Bank  fit
into this picture? The South African Reserve  Bank  got  involved  in  these
contracts around the early 1970s. Truly, the issue of the forward book is  a
relic of the past which forms part of  the  previous  government's  exchange
rate management strategies, and this  present  Government  is  committed  to
closing down this relic of the past.

It is important, however, to know that the losses  and  gains  arising  from
currency depreciation or appreciation are  recorded  in  this  account.  The
losses on this account have  to  be  settled  by  Government.  Equally,  any
profits realised from these accounts have to be transferred to the  National
Revenue Fund. The balance of this account on  31  March  2000  was  a  debit
amount of $28 billion. However, I need to be quick to  point  out  that  the
net open forward position declined from a high of $23  billion  in  1998  to
$1,5 billion in January 2003.

Government has committed itself to paying this $28  billion  in  four  equal
amounts of $7 billion spread through the  coming  years.  We  are  confident
that the ANC Government will close this relic of the past. [Applause.]
Ms R TALJAARD: It is truly alarming, hon Minister, to see what  voodoo  does
to the mind. We trust you will soon recover.

Owing to the depreciation of the rand, the SA Reserve Bank made  significant
losses in settling its forward book obligations. While  subsequent  currency
strength may ameliorate these losses, they are being settled  in  accordance
with the payment amounts for  the  2002-03,  2003-04,  2004-05  and  2005-06
financial years provided for in the Bill before the House today as a  direct
charge against the National Revenue Fund.

The fiscal framework makes  provision  for  an  amount  of  R28  billion  in
payments spread over four years, pending a final audit of the  total  amount
that is for the account of the fiscus in  accordance  with  the  explanatory
memorandum of the Bill. Paragraph 4 of the explanatory memorandum states:


  Although the total liability has yet to be finalised, the loss  reflected
  in the GFECRA balance is of such a magnitude that  a  partial  settlement
  had to be made during the 2002-03 year. This necessity  arises  from  the
  impact over time of forward losses on  liquidity  in  the  South  African
  money market, and the need to provide the Bank  with  resources  that  in
  turn are required for  the  effective  conduct  of  its  monetary  policy
  responsibilities.

It is regrettable that this Bill is being  rushed  through  Parliament  with
such haste. Though, with the end  of  the  financial  year  looming,  it  is
probably understandable. However, it would have been desirable to hear  from
the SA Reserve Bank  on  how  the  account  balance  hinders  the  effective
conduct of monetary policy, to hear further detail on  the  impact  of  this
account on liquidity in the money market  and  to  hear  expert  opinion  on
whether the route chosen to defray this  account  liability  is  indeed  the
best route out of available alternatives. This, Minister, although  you  may
not like it, is the interrogative role Parliament should play and  the  role
that it has been denied in processing this matter.

The procedure followed in respect of the processing of this Bill  is  wholly
insufficient and, with due  respect,  deficient.  The  Minister  of  Finance
introduced this Bill in the House on Wednesday last week. This  morning  the
Portfolio Committee on Finance held brief deliberations on its  content  and
this afternoon we are debating it. We do not  believe  that  this  is  sound
parliamentary practice. We believe that the Bill  is  being  processed  with
undue haste, even though the matter was raised, in principle  only,  in  the
Medium Term Budget Policy Statement last year, with insufficient  input  and
other views expressed before the committee.  We  do  not  believe  that  the
matter has been sufficiently dealt with  and  will  therefore  abstain  from
voting on this Bill.

Furthermore, there  are  questions  that  have  to  be  asked  about  recent
statements and reports that suggest the SA Reserve Bank  has  intervened  in
the currency  market.  Last  year's  Medium  Term  Budget  Policy  Statement
stated:


  The Reserve Bank's approach has been to  not  intervene  in  the  foreign
  exchange market in order to build up foreign reserves or contract the net
  open forward position. Only proceeds from Government's foreign  borrowing
  and privatisation were used to reduce the NOFP.

While one can understand anxiety at the slow rate of  privatisation  proceed
inflows and  the  desire  to  wind  down  the  remaining  net  open  forward
position, there are questions that  arise  from  recent  reports  about  the
actions of the Reserve Bank that will be pursued when the  Governor  of  the
Reserve Bank appears before the committee on Friday.

These questions must be cleared up in order to gain  clear  answers  on  the
policy pursued by the Bank in respect of the foreign exchange market.  These
are important questions. The Governor has indicated  on  previous  occasions
before the committee that he would like to have an  opportunity  to  discuss
fully with the committee the impact of the  wording  of  his  constitutional
mandate in terms of section 224 of the Constitution. Perhaps  the  time  has
come for that discussion on Friday. I thank you.

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the highly  competent  acting  chair  of
the Portfolio Committee  on  Finance  gave  a  very  lucid  lecture  on  the
technicalities of the Bill a moment ago, which doesn't leave the rest of  us
with much to say.

Yes, I think the situation we're looking at  has  been  many  years  in  the
making. We all know what it's about and we've all followed it over  time.  I
think the important point that the hon Moloto raises  concerns  the  forward
book and the contracts, and  we  are  aware  that  there  have  been  policy
changes there and that that situation is  unlikely  to  repeat  itself,  and
that is the situation that accounts for most of  the  losses  we're  talking
about.

With regard to the remainder of the losses  from  the  gold  price  and  the
value of the rand, we're fully aware  of  what  happened  in  recent  times,
especially last year and the year before. But  there  again,  the  rand  has
stabilised,  as  has  the  gold  price,  so  hopefully  we  won't  expect  a
repetition of these losses. Indeed, there is every  possibility  that  there
could be some profits flowing back into the National  Revenue  Fund  in  the
years ahead. With that we support the Bill.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, in  the  2003  Budget
Review the National Treasury proposed to settle the outstanding  balance  on
the Gold and Foreign Exchange Contingency  Reserve  Account  over  the  next
three years. The review states:


  Government is to issue nil coupons to an amount of R7  billion  per  year
  over the next three years to the SA Reserve Bank.
It is noteworthy to note that the net open forward position of  the  Reserve
Bank has declined dramatically from $23,3  billion  in  1998  to  only  $1,5
billion in January of this year. It is known that the Reserve  Bank  intends
to reduce this outstanding amount to zero and we will  support  the  Reserve
Bank in its aim to eliminate the net open forward position.

It's a known fact that the depreciation in the rand  results  in  losses  on
this account and appreciation results in profits in this account.  Owing  to
this volatility in the value of the rand and the gold price,  it  remains  a
difficult task to manage  the  balance  on  this  account.  Neither  the  SA
Reserve Bank nor Treasury have control over these  events.  Subject  to  the
findings of the current audit investigation, the UDM supports the  Gold  and
Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account Defrayal Bill. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The MF notes that  foreign
debt has been a major burden on our economy. Further, the hammering  of  the
rand has contributed to this greatly as  we  see  that  the  Bank's  forward
exchange cover has often exceeded its foreign assets as a result of this.

The MF is, however, pleased with the substantial decrease of  the  net  open
forward position from $23,2 billion in  1998  to  $1,5  billion  in  January
2003, and supports a decision taken by the Bank and Treasury to  settle  the
outstanding balance on the Gold and  Foreign  Exchange  Contingency  Reserve
Account,  the  GFECRA,  subject  to  the  finding  of  the   current   audit
investigation, over a four-year period. The MF understands the necessity  of
payment made to the liabilities of the GFECRA over the past financial  year,
and further supports the annual payment of R7 billion for  three  years,  as
proposed by the Treasury.

However, concern is expressed as to what impact the current war in Iraq  may
have on our currency and how it will affect the above.  Noting  that  it  is
Government's responsibility to settle the debt and  the  decision  has  been
made, timing of payment as decided  upon  by  the  Bank  and  Treasury  have
defrayed the direct charges  in  support.  The  MF  supports  the  Gold  and
Foreign Exchange Contingency Reserve Account Defrayal Bill. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE:  Thank  you,  Deputy  Speaker.  Let's  just  remind
ourselves that what we're dealing  with  here  is  a  statutory  obligation,
defined, not in the defrayal Bill  before  us,  but  in  the  South  African
Reserve Bank Act in sections 25 to 27, and section 28; 28(3) in  particular,
is very specific about what's required of Government, so I  don't  know  why
we want to debate the issue if there's a statutory obligation.

That statutory obligation must be met and all that we're doing is saying  to
Parliament we need to do this in a measured way. The measured  period  we're
suggesting is four years. As  a  number  of  speakers  have  said  in  their
contributions, it's subject to an audit, because  the  Auditor-General  must
confirm what the amount is and that the amount was, in  fact,  built  up  in
terms of the powers vested in the Reserve Bank by its own legislation.

Now, I'm sure in the discussion with the Governor all manner of  things  are
possible, but that is about recognising  the  independence  of  the  central
bank. This is  not  about  the  independence,  this  is  about  a  statutory
obligation. Let me remind the hon Taljaard that Business Day has  apologised
for the confusion that they've created in the minds  of  some,  but  clearly
that confusion still reigns in yours. I thank you, Deputy Speaker.

Papers:

1.    The Acting Minister of Transport:


     Response to a resolution passed by the House  on  23  October  2002  in
     respect of the safety  of  passengers  travelling  on  Metrorail,  with
     specific reference to an incident on a train to Khayelitsha:


     NATIONAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION OF 23 OCTOBER
     REQUEST FOR ACTION DATED 1 NOVEMBER 2002


     Passenger security in the Western Cape - Four  passengers  were  robbed
     and thrown to their deaths by thugs on a train to Khayelitsha.


     SARCC RESPONSE


     Report of the incident: On 21 October 2002, at 21:00, it  was  reported
     that four persons between the ages of 13-21 years old were  found  next
     to the railway line between Esplanade and Bay Junction stations in  the
     Western Cape. Two were fatally injured and the other two  injured  were
     taken to hospital. It is alleged, as was also reported  in  the  media,
     that they were thrown from a train during a robbery.


     It could not be ascertained whether they were robbed, or  whether  they
     were the perpetrators in a robbery.
     The case was handed over to the SAPS who opened  murder  and  attempted
     murder dossiers. The SAPS is currently investigating the case.


     SARCC SAFETY AND SECURITY STRATEGY IN THE WESTERN CAPE


     The  SARCC  has  been  investigating  the  increase  in   crime-related
     incidents on the total commuter rail system  since  March  2002.  Apart
     from human loss and  injuries,  insurance-related  incidents  of  cable
     theft, fires and vandalism have also increased the costs  of  providing
     services.


     A total safety and security strategy has been developed and tested,  as
     a feasibility study, with Metrorail on a section of  the  Western  Cape
     rail system. The feasibility project delivered  very  positive  results
     and were implemented on the entire Western Cape network  since  October
     2002.


     The project involves alarms  on  cables,  helicopter  surveillance  and
     dedicated armed security response teams.  Operations  are  co-ordinated
     with Metrorail and SAPS security and safety strategies.


     The dedicated security teams also provide:


     - Medical assistance to injured commuters.
     - Armed response on SARCC infrastructure.
     - Removing trespassers from SARCC property.
     - Reporting and intervention in terms of acts of sabotage and violence.
     - General crime prevention patrols on stations.
     - Development of intelligence capability.
     RESULTS FROM THE FEASIBILITY STUDY


     - Arrested cable theft syndicates with SAPS. (Syndicates also  involved
         in other criminal activities such as drug trafficking, etc.)
     - 28 perpetrators arrested.
     - Recovered stolen property.
     - Cable theft decreased in the  study  area  from  an  average  of  4/5
         incidents per  month,  to  zero  incidents  for  three  consecutive
         months.


     RESULTS AFTER FULL IMPLEMENTATION ON THE ENTIRE WESTERN CAPE NETWORK  -
     OCTOBER 2002


     The following is the result of the abovementioned implementation:


     OCTOBER 2002 - DECEMBER 2002


     - Serious crime-related incidents  -     Decreased 63%.
     - Serious liability incidents -    Decreased 60%.
     - Murder     -    Decreased 63%.
     - Attempted murder      -     Decreased 63%.
     - Assault    -    Decreased 58%.
     - Robbery    -    Decreased 53%.
     - Asset damage    -     Decreased 20%.


     IMPROVEMENT OF SAFETY AND SECURITY STRATEGY


     Metrorail and SARCC are  currently  investigating  and  implementing  a
     number of additional operational actions to further augment the overall
     safety and security strategy in the Western Cape:


     - Ensure doors are closed before trains depart.
     - Replace windows with vandal proof  composite  materials  to  decrease
         theft of windows.
     - Investigating the testing of an alarm panic button on trains.
     - Re-deployment of security guards.
