The SPEAKER: Hon members, I apologise for this late  start.  Please  do  not

                          VICTORY OF BONGANI MVUMVU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr C H F GREYLING: Mevrou die Speaker, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Huis -


  (1) met trots kennis neem dat die 14-jarige Bongani Mvumvu  van  Philippi
       onlangs      die      Internasionale      Ruiterkunsfederasie      se
       wêrelddresseerkampioen in sy ouderdomsgroep geword het;


  (2) van mening is dat Bongani se oorwinning nog merkwaardiger gemaak word
       daardeur dat hy haweloos was voordat die Mohr-familie  hom  in  hulle
       sorg geneem het en hy die geleentheid gekry  het  om  sy  talent  vir
       perdry te ontwikkel;


  (3) glo dat dié jong kampioen se naam nog sinoniem  met  perdryprestasies
       gaan word en dat sy uitmuntende prestasie 'n inspirasie vir  duisende
       ander kinders is; en


  (4) Bongani alle sterkte toewens vir die toekoms.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:
  That the House -


  (1) notes with pride that 14-year-old Bongani Mvumvu of Philippi recently
       became the  International  Showjumping  Federation's  world  dressage
       champion in his age group;


  (2) is of the opinion that Bongani's victory is made even more remarkable
       by the fact that he was homeless before the Mohr family took  him  in
       and he was given the opportunity to develop  his  talent  for  horse-
       riding;


  (3) believes that this young champion's name will become synonymous  with
       horse-riding achievements and that his excellent achievements are  an
       inspiration for thousands of other children; and


  (4) wishes Bongani well for his future.]

Agreed to.

                         INTERNATIONAL LITERACY WEEK
                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  that the decade 2003 to 2012 is United Nations  Literacy  Decade
           under the theme "Literacy as Freedom";


       (b)  that the week from 1 to 8 September  is  International  Literacy
           Week under the theme "Together Developing Literacy and  a  Voice
           for All"; and


       (c)  the persistence  of  the  gender  gap  in  education,  which  is
           reflected by the fact that nearly  two  thirds  of  the  world's
           adult illiterates are women;


  (2) believes that -
       (a)  the realisation of the right to education, especially for girls,
           contributes to the eradication of poverty;


       (b)  literacy is crucial to the acquisition, by  every  child,  youth
           and adult, of essential life skills that enable them to  address
           the  challenges  they  can  face  in  life,  and  represents  an
           essential step in basic education,  which  is  an  indispensable
           means for effective participation in the societies and economies
           of the twenty-first century; and


       (c)  literacy for all is at the heart of basic education for all  and
           that creating literate environments and societies  is  essential
           for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty,  reducing  child
           mortality, curbing population growth, achieving gender  equality
           and ensuring sustainable development, peace and democracy;


  (3) conveys its support for literacy programmes, projects  and  campaigns
       undertaken by the Government, the private sector and NGOs;


  (4) congratulates all learners,  especially  adult  learners,  and  their
       educators and institutions who are participating in these programmes;
       and


  (5) encourages all South Africans who cannot read and/or write to  access
       the learning institutions  created  for  literacy  and  by  doing  so
       position themselves to have a better life and a meaningful  voice  in
       the affairs of the country.

Agreed to.

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the South African athletics team on its achievements at
       the Athletics World Championships held in Paris;

       Mbulaeni Mulaudzi on  winning  bronze  in  the  800  metres  and  the
       marathon team who also took the bronze medal.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                         (The late Mrs Ntombi Shope)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam  Speaker,  on  behalf  of
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, I move the  draft  resolution  printed
in his name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with a deep sense of sadness the untimely passing away of Ntombi
           Shope,  MP, on 13 August 2003;


       (b)  that Ntombi Shope was a patriot who spent all her life  fighting
           for the right of all South Africans to equality and justice  and
           that she worked tirelessly and selflessly  with  the  people  of
           this country to defeat the cancer of  sexism,  racism,  national
           oppression and economic exploitation;


       (c)   that  she  contributed  immensely  to  the  birth  of  the  new
           democratic dispensation as a member of the then UDF and  of  the
           ANC and was also a tireless worker  in  the  ranks  of  the  ANC
           Women's League;


       (d)  that her courage, vision and moral stamina continue  to  inspire
           us as we work to create a better future for all  the  people  of
           our land; and


       (e)  that the people of this  country  have  lost  a  heroine  and  a
           combatant   for   democracy,   social   justice   and    women's
           emancipation; and


  (2) expresses its  sincere  condolences  to  her  children,  friends  and
       colleagues and to the Shope family.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam  Speaker,  the  Democratic  Alliance
wishes to associate itself with the resolution and with  the  tribute  which
was paid to our late hon colleague.
I had the privilege and  pleasure  of  going  on  a  study  tour  with  this
colleague some years ago, and I remember being particularly struck  then  by
her courage, because at that stage she was  suffering  from  a  painful  and
almost disabling condition, and not a word of complaint passed her  lips  at
all. I thought then that she was an example to many other people.

The Democratic Alliance extends very  sincere  condolences  to  her  family,
friends, and loved ones and to her political party.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, the IFP conveys it heartfelt condolences  to
the Shope family, the ANC, friends, colleagues and all those who were  close
to  her,  especially  our  chairperson  of  the   Portfolio   Committee   on
Environmental Affairs and Tourism,  Gwen  Mahlangu,  and  the  committee  at
large. We served with her  in  that  Portfolio  Committee  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism, and she was exemplary there.

We will miss Ntombi at the portfolio committee meetings. She was  a  devoted
member of Parliament and she shaped that portfolio committee  into  what  it
is today. All parties are working harmoniously. May we  get  another  Ntombi
in that portfolio committee. Ntombi was cool, calm and collected.

Uphumule kahle, ntombazane. [Rest in peace, girl.]

May your soul rest in peace. I thank you.

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, on behalf of the New NP I want  to  support  the
motion of condolence by the Chief Whip of the Majority Party as  it  appears
on the Order Paper.

On behalf of the New NP I want to convey  our  sincere  condolences  to  the
Shope family and the ANC, the organisation which she served so loyally.  The
Shope family has been known over many years for  their  commitment  to  this
country and its people, especially the poor.

During the June recess I had the good fortune to meet Sheila, the sister  of
the late Ntombi Shope. She told me about a  successful  programme  they  had
introduced in the Limpopo province that assisted poor rural women to  create
sustainable food security. The life  of  the  late  member  and  her  family
should be an example to the members of this House of how we  can  serve  the
people who voted for us. May that be her legacy to us.

Farewell, young maiden.

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, it is with shock  and  great  sadness  that  we
have learned of the death of Mrs Ntombi Shope, an MP  representing  the  ANC
and a member of the NEC of the ANC Women's League. We also learned that  Mrs
Shope had dedicated her entire life to a cause she  sincerely  believed  in,
namely the struggle for freedom and democracy in South Africa.  Despite  her
busy political schedule and many demands made on her  time,  she  strove  to
play an active role in  the  church.  She  was  active  in  the  Evangelical
Presbyterian Church and worked for the South African Council of Churches  as
a field worker from 1988 to 1990.

On behalf of the ACDP, I fully support the draft resolution and  I  wish  to
express our sincere condolences to her political party and  all  her  family
members, in particular her  four  children  -  Gevasa,  Sheila,  Victor  and
Nelson, who are still in mourning. May the Lord God console  them  in  their
time of mourning. I thank you.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Speaker and hon members, it  is  always  sad  to  bid
farewell to a fellow parliamentarian. Mrs Shope will be remembered by  those
she worked with as a person dedicated to her  work  and  to  the  people  of
South Africa. We realise that Mrs Shope was a committed democrat  and  South
African. Her passing is a loss to this institution.

The UDM would like to  extend  its  heartfelt  condolences  to  the  family,
friends and colleagues of Mrs Shope. Our prayers are with  you  during  this
time of bereavement, and we hope that her life's work will  leave  a  legacy
that will console you and moderate the sense of loss that you feel  at  this
time.

May her soul rest in peace. I thank you.

Dr C P MULDER: Mev die Speaker, dit is vir my 'n voorreg om  namens  die  VF
ons opregte simpatie en meelewing te betuig aan die familie en  vriende  van
die oorledene, ook aan die ANC wat een van hulle kollegas verloor het.

Dit is altyd hartseer as ons een van ons kollegas verloor  en  ons  wil  van
ons kant af ons assosieer met die mosie wat voor die Raad is, maar  ook  ons
opregte simpatie en meelewing uitspreek, en die vertroue uitspreek dat  haar
familie en vriende berusting sal vind en die krag sal kry om voort te  gaan.
Baie dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr C P MULDER: Madam Speaker, it is my privilege, on behalf of the  FF,  to
convey our sincere sympathy and condolences to the  family  and  friends  of
the deceased, as well as to the ANC who have lost one of their colleagues.

It always saddens us when we lose one of our colleagues and for our past  we
want to identify ourselves  with  the  motion  before  the  House  and  also
express our sincere sympathy and condolences, and trust that her family  and
friends will find acceptance and the strength to carry on.  Thank  you  very
much.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker, it is a sad day when we pay  homage  to  one
our number whose lifespan covered five decades and who  served  our  country
as a legislator for almost a decade.

We in the UCDP take solace in the fact that she walked close  to  her  Lord,
in that despite her tight schedule she could find time  to  be  involved  in
the Master's vineyard as a member of the Mothers' Guild of  the  Evangelical
Presbyterian Church.

As a  political  activist,  Ntombi  served  as  a  member  of  the  regional
executive of the organisation - testimony to her diligence  when  one  takes
into account that the ANC is a broad church.

To celebrate her life all those who were close  to  her  would  do  well  to
strive for the good she hankered for. We from the UCDP wish her next of  kin
and her party strength from above and say: That is the way of all  flesh.  I
thank you.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, the PAC expresses its heartfelt sympathies  to
the Shope family and to the ANC on the death of Mrs Shope.

Mrs Shope was a member of this House and served with  quiet  dedication  and
dignity. When her husband died, the PAC wrote  her  a  letter  of  sympathy,
little realising that she would be following shortly after.

Mrs Shope served the liberation struggle during the  difficult  times  until
the end of the struggle. She, like others, fought hard to bring  freedom  to
many people in this country, even those who may not be aware of it.
We salute her contributions to a free South Africa and her service  to  this
first democratic Parliament of our nation. May she rest in peace.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker. On behalf  of  the  MF,  I  would
like to take this opportunity to extend our deepest condolences on the  loss
of our hon member, Ntombi Shope.

Shope's dedication to the struggle through the leadership of the ANC  sparks
closure of another great contributor to the success of our democracy.

Not only a comrade in the struggle, Shope  also  dedicated  herself  to  the
upliftment and liberation of women in her work with Fedsaw, the ANC  Women's
League and as a member of Parliament. Her efforts  are  not  only  inspiring
but motivational as well. She shall be greatly missed.

I once again extend our condolences on the loss of hon Shope. May  she  rest
in peace. To her children, the ANC, the family, friends and comrades of  the
late Shope: May  Almighty  God  give  you  the  strength  to  overcome  this
difficult period. Thank you.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Speaker, persoonlik het ek nie vir wyle Ntombi Shope  goed
geken  nie.  Tog  by  die  nagaan  van  haar  curriculum  vitae,  het   twee
ooreenkomste my opgeval: Sy is in dieselfde jaar as ek gebore, wat my  onder
die besef gebring het van die kortstondigheid van  hierdie  lewe,  maar  ook
dat sy in die fleur van haar lewe dood is. Tweedens, haar  hele  lewensiklus
is begin en voltooi in Tzaneen, in die Limpopo  provinsie.  Tzaneen  was  my
eerste gemeente waar ek vir sewe jaar  gearbei  het  -  wat  my  betref  die
mooiste plek in Suid-Afrika.

Wat verder opvallend is, is dat sy  haar  lewe  daaraan  gewy  het  om  haar
kwalifikasies te verbeter. So het sy eers op 29-jarige leeftyd haar  matriek
voltooi en daarna deur private studie nog  drie  kwalifikasies  verwerf.  So
ver dit duidelik is, het sy haar lewe gewy aan onbaatsugtige diens aan  haar
mense, aanvanklik as aktivis en na 1994 as politikus. In dié  opsig  het  sy
`n navolgenswaardige voorbeeld gestel, naamlik dat die sin  van  lewe  geleë
is in diens aan jou medemens, jou gemeenskap, jou kerk en jou land. `n  Mens
kan in die besonder dink aan die woorde van onse Here Jesus:  ``Dis  saliger
om te gee as om te ontvang.''

Ons meegevoel gaan aan die ANC,  en  die  talle  organisasies  waar  sy  met
toewyding gedien het. Waar haar eggenoot ook reeds oorlede is, dink  ons  in
die besonder aan haar ses kinders wat alleen agtergelaat  is.  Ons  bede  is
dat ons Hemelse Vader, wat nie een van sy kinders  as  wees  agterlaat  nie,
hulle ook sal versorg en vertroos.

Die Nasionale Aksie ondersteun hierdie mosie van meegevoel met die  heengaan
van  wyle  agb  Ntombi  Shope.  Dankie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Speaker, I personally did not know the late  Ntombi  Shope
well. However, in looking at her curriculum vitae, two  similarities  struck
me: She was born in the same year as me, which made  me  realise  how  short
this life is, but also that she died in her prime. Secondly, her life  cycle
began and ended in Tzaneen in the Limpopo province.  Tzaneen  was  my  first
congregation where I worked for seven years - the most  beautiful  place  in
South Africa, as far as I am concerned.

What is also striking is that  she  dedicated  her  life  to  improving  her
qualifications. She only completed her matric at the age  of  29  and  after
that obtained three qualifications through private study. As far as one  can
see, she dedicated her life to selfless service to her people, initially  as
an activist and after 1994 as a  politician.  In  this  regard  she  set  an
example worth following, namely that the meaning of life lies in service  to
your fellow man, your community, your  church  and  your  country.  One  can
think in particular of the words of our Lord Jesus: ``It is more blessed  to
give than to receive.''

Our condolences go to the ANC  and  the  numerous  organisations  where  she
served with dedication. As her spouse is also already deceased, we think  in
particular of her six children who have been left alone. Our prayer is  that
our Heavenly Father, who does not leave one of His children  orphaned,  will
also care for and comfort them.

The National Action supports this motion of condolence on the death  of  the
late hon Ntombi Shope. Thank you.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Madam  Speaker,  hon  members,  the
IAM associates itself with the draft resolution before the  House  and  with
the sentiments expressed in memory of the late hon  member  of  this  House,
Mrs Ntombi Shope. We wish to extend our sincerest  condolences  to  all  her
ANC colleagues, her family and friends in their sad loss. May her soul  rest
in peace. Thank you.

Mr L N DIALE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Ministers and colleagues,  today  we
pay tribute to  Ntombi  Shope,  one  of  the  indefatigable  heroes  of  our
struggle for democracy and social justice.

Her history of activism spread out  over  a  wide  range  of  political  and
social involvement. In 1982, at the University  of  the  North,  she  served
Azaso as a branch secretary. In 1983 she became branch organiser  of  Fedsaw
and in the same year she served as a member of the interim committee of  the
UDF in the then Transvaal. The list is endless. However, her political  home
throughout her life was the ANC and the ANC Women's  League,  through  which
she pursued, together with the majority of the people of this  country,  the
goal of creating a democratic, nonracial, nonsexist, prosperous  and  united
South Africa.

Ntombi leaves behind the legacy of a freedom fighter. She leaves  behind  an
immense contribution to the destruction of apartheid, to the destruction  of
the policy whose basic perspective and practice was  discriminatory  against
the majority of people and a crime against humanity.  She  leaves  behind  a
noble tradition of a sense of humanity - love - a tradition contributing  to
the  obligatory  effort  of  uniting  all   people,   of   formulating   and
implementing the reconstruction and development  programme,  the  integrated
sustainable rural development programme, social grants and many more.

Ntombi was born and grew up in a country whose regime was  bent  on  forcing
the majority of its citizens  to  live  life  under  inhuman  and  degrading
conditions. All avenues to development and to a better  life  were  shut  to
them. To the  majority  was  allocated  substandard  education,  substandard
health  and  welfare  resources.  Cheap  labour  policies   and   employment
segregation ensured that theirs would be a life without skills,  which  left
skills deliberately concentrated in white hands.

To this sad history, Ntombi responded by joining the liberation movement  so
that she could,  together  with  the  majority  in  this  country,  put  her
shoulder to the wheel and be part of the collective  effort  to  deliver  to
all a truly free and just society.

As we bid our final and proud farewell to a life led in the service  of  the
people, we the people, the women and children of our country, bow in  salute
to the fallen heroine of our people. And  as  we  do  so,  we  reaffirm  our
commitment to the principles she fought and stood for throughout her life.
May we convey the message humbly to her, plead with her to  rest  in  peace,
knowing that those she leaves behind will continue  to  work  with  all  the
people of our country.  We  shall  concentrate  all  our  physical,  mental,
spiritual strengths until the day when all our people shall live in a  truly
free, democratic, nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous society.

We share the grief and the pain  of  the  Shope  family,  her  children  and
friends, and we offer our condolences and extend the  support  and  sympathy
of the House. I thank you.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, I take it there are no objections to  the  motion.
The Deputy Speaker and I wish to associate  ourselves  with  the  sentiments
that have been expressed here. Ntombi has been a friend to both of us and  a
colleague for many, many years. I will now ask members  please  to  rise  in
memory of the hon Mrs Shope.

The condolences which have been expressed in this House will be conveyed  to
the Shope family.

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to, all members standing.

        AD HOC COMMITTEE ON GENERAL INTELLIGENCE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  move  the  motion
printed in my name on the Order Paper as follows:


  That the House ratifies the decision by the Speaker to  establish  an  Ad
  Hoc Committee on General Intelligence Laws Amendment  Bill  in  terms  of
  Rule 214 (See Announcements, Tablings and Committee  Reports,  22  August
  2003, p 831).

Agreed to.

                 ELECTION OF EXECUTIVE OF ANC WOMEN'S LEAGUE

                            (Member's Statement)
Mrs M M MALUMISE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  the  ANC  congratulates  the  ANC
Women's League on holding a successful fourth national  conference  from  28
to 31 August 2003.

We congratulate the newly elected leadership  of  the  ANC  Women's  League:
President  Nosiviwe  Mapisa-Nqakula,  Deputy  President  Mavivi   Myakayaka-
Manzini, Secretary-General Bathabile Dlamini, Deputy Secretary-General  Kiki
Rhweqana and Treasurer-General Bertha Gxowa, as well  as  other  members  of
the NEC. We  salute  the  ANC  Women's  League  for  its  proud  history  of
mobilising women  into  the  ranks  of  the  national  liberation  movement,
placing issues of the emancipation of women on the agenda  of  the  ANC  and
giving leadership and organisational expression to the struggle  for  gender
equality in South Africa.

The ANC Women's League has committed itself to leading  the  building  of  a
multiracial progressive women's  movement,  capable  of  uniting  all  South
African women around programmes that address the  question  of  gender-based
oppression. These programmes will  include  programmes  addressing  violence
against women; combating disease,  including  HIV  and  Aids;  the  economic
empowerment of women; child abuse; and poverty eradication.

The ANC  Women's  League  has  also  dedicated  itself  to  working  for  an
overwhelming ANC victory in the 2004 elections in the belief  that  the  ANC
has for more than 90 years represented the aspirations of  our  people,  and
continues to embody our best hope for a better life for all South  Africans,
women in particular.

Viva the ANC Women's League! Viva! [Applause.]

                     RACE DEBACLE IN SOUTH AFRICAN RUGBY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr T D LEE (DA): Mev die Speaker, Geo Cronjé is  die  enigste  persoon  wat
met eer uit die bewerings rondom die rassedebakel gekom  het.  Hy  het  baie
beheersd en waardig opgetree. Hy is onregverdiglik verneder en verguis.  Ten
spyte van die feit dat hy as gevolg  van  die  aantygings  sy  plek  in  die
Springbokspan kwyt is, het hy nogtans die span  sterkte  toegewens  en  trou
aan Suid-Afrikaanse rugby gesweer. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Sarvu se ondeurdagte optrede was  uiters  ongelukkig.  Op  grond  van  hulle
optrede, waarop  baie  Suid-Afrikaners  vertrou  het,  het  die  mediasirkus
begin. Om agterna uit te vind dat mens nie Sarvu kan vertrou  nie,  was  vir
ons almal 'n skok. Enige  bewering  van  rassisme,  veral  soos  deur  Sarvu
verklaar, is van 'n baie ernstige aard en kan nie geïgnoreer word nie.  Soos
wat die DA versoek het, verg dit 'n spoedige en deeglike ondersoek. Ons  het
ook daarop aangedring, soos wat ek daardie dag  herhaaldelik  op  die  radio
gedoen het, dat Geo Cronjé die geleentheid gebied moes word om sy  kant  van
die saak te stel. Ek dank u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member’s statement follows.)

[Mr T D LEE (DA): Madam Speaker, Geo Cronjé is the only person who  made  it
through the allegations surrounding  the  racial  debacle  with  honour.  He
acted in  a  very  collected  manner  and  with  dignity.  He  was  unfairly
humiliated and denigrated. In spite of the fact that he lost  his  place  in
the Springbok rugby team as a result of these allegations,  he  nevertheless
wished the team good luck and  swore  allegiance  to  South  African  rugby.
[Interjections.]

Sarvu's ill-considered conduct was  really  unfortunate.  On  the  basis  of
their actions, on  which  many  South  Africans  relied,  the  media  circus
commenced. To find out afterwards that one cannot trust Sarvu  was  a  shock
to all of us. Any allegation of racism, especially like that made by  Sarvu,
is of a very serious nature and cannot be ignored. As the DA  requested,  it
requires a timeous and  thorough  investigation.  We  also  insisted,  as  I
repeatedly did on the radio that day,  that  Geo  Cronjé  should  have  been
afforded the opportunity  to  put  his  side  of  the  case.  I  thank  you.
[Interjections.]]

              MINIMUM WAGE STIPULATION USED TO RETRENCH WORKERS

                            (Member's Statement)
Mr N S MIDDLETON (IFP): Madam Speaker, it is becoming a South African  trend
for farmers to use the minimum wage stipulation by the Department of  Labour
to retrench workers, and sometimes even evict them  from  their  farms  when
they ask for the minimum  wage.  It  has  been  reported  that  about  2 000
farmworkers have lost their  jobs  and  homes  merely  for  asking  for  the
minimum wage.

This has mostly affected workers in the Limpopo province. It has  also  been
reported that the children of these farmworkers have  had  to  drop  out  of
farm schools following the eviction of  their  parents.  This  situation  is
imposing hunger and suffering on both the workers and their children.

We believe that this treatment meted out to fellow  human  beings  by  those
who have the means to alleviate their plight, is unfair. The  proper  course
for these farmers to adopt is to apply for exemption  from  the  provisions,
as described in the sectoral determination. Instead, the  farmers  give  the
jobs to immigrants from Zimbabwe and Mozambique who  are  prepared  to  work
for slave wages. We are not against immigrants getting  jobs,  but  we  take
exception to their being  employed  at  the  expense  of  our  fellow  South
Africans. I thank you. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: I call on the ANC, but before you begin, hon  member,  I  would
appeal to you please to stay with the microphone. It is  not  the  equipment
that is at fault. We are trying to identify the microphones. So  please,  if
you do not get a sound immediately, just stay there. Do not move.

                     SOCIAL GRANT BACKPAY FOR PENSIONER

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms L M T XINGWANA  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  83-year-old  Elsie  Schoeman,  a
social welfare pensioner from Stutterheim, received backpay of R26 000  from
the Department of Social Development on 12 August 2003. This was  after  Mrs
Schoeman had mistakenly been declared deceased by  the  Department  of  Home
Affairs in 1986. The ANC believes that this deprived  Mrs  Schoeman  of  her
constitutional right to a social grant. We  commend  Government  for  having
identified and speedily  rectified  this  error.  The  intervention  by  our
democratic Government is proof of our commitment to improving the  lives  of
our people in our resolve to roll back the frontiers  of  poverty.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

         DA COMPLAINT AGAINST MINISTER - REPORT OF PUBLIC PROTECTOR

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Madam Speaker, the  alleged  spin  on  information  in
reports on Iraq has made international headlines recently, and even  led  to
the resignation of Prime Minister Tony Blair's media man Alistair Campbell.

In similar fashion the Official Opposition has perfected the art of  putting
a spin on information to grab the headlines. So often we read of threats  by
the DA to institute proceedings in some or other watchdog body.  This  often
is nothing more than hot air and soundbite politics.

A recent example clearly illustrates this point.  The  hon  Douglas  Gibson,
with lots of fanfare and media hype laid  a  complaint  against  a  Minister
with the Public Protector. However, in this  report  issued  by  the  Public
Protector clearing the said Minister, the Public Protector stated:


  Mr Gibson, the complainant in the matter, was invited to share  with  the
  Public Protector any further views  he  might  have  had  on  the  matter
  referred to in this report.

What the New NP finds shocking is that the hon Gibson,  true  to  DA  style,
did not follow through, and I quote:


  Unfortunately, although he accepted the invitation, he failed  to  honour
  it or to apologise.

The New NP calls on the hon Gibson to  join  the  SAA's  campaign  to  weigh
passengers so that this House can establish the real weight of  hot  air.  I
thank you. [Laughter.] [Applause.]
              LAND AFFAIRS - EFFECTS OF POLICY ON VALUE OF LAND

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C DUDLEY (ACDP):  Madam  Speaker,  whatever  the  intention,  it  is  the
opinion of the ACDP that one thing is  sure:  in  destroying  the  value  of
land, agriculture is destroyed, and food security becomes a distant dream.

Pending legislation giving the Minister powers to expropriate  land  without
a court order puts Government squarely on track to  ensure  that  previously
disadvantaged South Africans become the proud owners of land with no  value.
New and old farmers  will  now  have  liabilities  instead  of  assets  with
disastrous consequences for all. We have only to look at Angola,  Mozambique
and Zimbabwe to see the results of this sort of folly.  The  power  to  take
all the land  those  governments  wanted  did  not  lead  to  prosperity  or
productivity, but instead you cannot even give away the land now.

When land has no value, no-one  can  produce.  There  is  no  interest  and,
ultimately,  no  food.  High  land  prices  are  Government's   excuse   for
legislation to expropriate  land,  yet  land  prices  in  South  Africa  are
amongst the lowest in the world, thanks  to  the  eroding  power  of  unwise
political statements such as these. Without good land  prices  farmers  have
no collateral to access finance for production and  there  is  no  incentive
for property owners to invest in agriculture.

Perceived property rights are the  reason  for  the  agricultural  stability
until now, but unwise government  action  and  statements  are  eroding  the
value of land and private property, sabotaging the wealth and future  wealth
of the nation.

The ACDP supports the Department of Land Affairs in its endeavours  to  find
fair, reasonable solutions to issues surrounding  land  restitution  and  of
course agrees that the co-operation of farmers is essential to land  reform.
Land restitution, however, is a sensitive issue that requires  a  change  of
attitude across the spectrum. It is therefore not helpful to single out  one
specific sector to pay for all apartheid's injustices. Vital  to  the  issue
is not simply acquisition and availability of land,  but  how  the  land  is
used.

South Africa is one of seven net food exporters in the  world  in  spite  of
shallow soil and low rainfall, due  to  the  tremendous  skills  accumulated
agriculturally and industrially. This major source of  foreign  exchange  is
an asset which should be valued and protected. It  is  counterproductive  to
target  farmers  with  accusations  that  they  are  not  co-operating   and
threatening to  take  their  land  instead  of  creating  opportunities  and
support  for  emerging  farmers  while  also  valuing  efforts  of  existing
commercial farmers that ensure wealth creation and not a  poverty  trap  for
all. Thank you.

           EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN - SCHOLARSHIPS FOR FURTHER STUDIES
                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N S MTSWENI (ANC): Madam Speaker, Busisiwe Mzoneli,  a  secondary  school
teacher from a rural area in KwaZulu-Natal, flew to the UK last  week  after
obtaining a scholarship from the Ford Foundation to study  teaching  methods
for travel and tourism at Bournemouth University.

The reality that women constitute the majority of people  who  are  poor  in
our country and also that they make up  a  larger  part  of  the  unskilled,
places an obligation  on  all  of  us  to  focus  our  programmes  on  women
empowerment and emancipation. It is in the light of  this  that  we  applaud
the Ford Foundation for making this important contribution  to  improve  the
lives of the people. This served to emphasise the critically important  role
of public-private partnerships in changing people's lives for the better.

We call upon all other business entities  and  organisations  to  put  their
shoulder to the wheel and contribute to the goal of creating a  better  life
for all our people. Thank you. [Applause.]

           ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION AGAINST DEPUTY PRESIDENT ZUMA
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B H HOLOMISA (UDM): Madam Speaker and hon members, the UDM calls  on  the
Government to immediately issue an ultimatum to the directors of  Thales  in
France, who have been implicated in allegations of corruption involving  the
Deputy President, to immediately co-operate with the Scorpions or  face  the
suspension of their company's participation in the arms deal.

In the meantime we need to ask: For how long can we  have  a  person  occupy
the office of the Deputy President when structures from the same  Government
have  publicly  stated  that  they  have  evidence  that  he   is   corrupt?
Ironically, we hear  ruling  party  spokespersons  proclaiming  that  Deputy
President Zuma has been exonerated. It is quite simply the confusion of  the
century.

We urge the President to clarify this confusion.  The  Ministry  of  Justice
says they have evidence that Deputy President Zuma  is  corrupt,  while  the
Minister  in  The  Office  of  the  President,  the  hon  Essop  Pahad,   is
continuously attacking the opposition parties and the media. Are we  perhaps
being blamed for observing that the emperor is naked, as has been  published
by the Ministry of Justice itself? I thank you.

                       LEVELS OF CRIME IN SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M A SEECO (UCDP): Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that South Africa  is
a good place to live  in.  The  beauty  of  the  countryside  enthrals  each
onlooker. Such beauty would be seen much better in this season of spring.

The only fly in the ointment is the high level of crime. Not a day  goes  by
without hearing about chilling  and  horrifying  reports  of  crime.  It  is
unthinkable how a criminal or criminals can gain  access  to  residences  of
Cabinet Ministers. Why is the Minister so asleep? It is chilling to  imagine
what could have  happened  to  the  Ministers  if  they  had  woken  up  and
confronted the intruders.
Without putting the blame at anybody's door, the police will  have  to  hone
their skills in their efforts to combat crime. Criminals always tend  to  be
a step ahead. Only on Friday criminals got  to  the  secure  burglar-proofed
residence of Mr Mere Manyaapelo in Maja-Mantsho,  Mafikeng  in  North  West,
scaled the roof to remove tiles, dropped  into  the  house  and  stabbed  Mr
Manyaapelo, leaving his mutilated body in a bath full of water.  The  police
did their utmost in a short space  of  time,  and  before  the  end  of  the
weekend arrests had been effected.

We commend the men and women in blue for the promptness  they  displayed  in
this particular case and call on the Government to tighten the  screws  when
the perpetrators are found guilty. Criminals should not be allowed to  spoil
our lives and in some circles there are already hints  to  the  effect  that
these crime levels may derail our efforts for the  2010  World  Cup  bid.  I
thank you.

     MINISTER ESSOP PAHAD'S CONDUCT IN REGARD TO ARMS DEAL INVESTIGATION

                            (Member's Statement)

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION (DA): Madam Speaker, ``Who  do  you  think  you
are to criticise the executive and the President?'' Those are the  words  in
which Minister Essop Pahad apparently demanded an answer of ANC  members  of
Scopa. [Interjections.]

This is how Minister Pahad began to undermine  the  investigation  into  the
arms deal and to strongarm Parliament. This is how his party began to  cover
up evidence of alleged corruption. [Interjections.]

This accusation does not come from the opposition. It  comes  from  Minister
Pahad's own ANC colleague, Andrew Feinstein, writing on Sunday  of  his  own
experiences under the ANC in Scopa.

Today, Minister  Pahad  continues  to  play  the  ``bad  cop,''  to  use  Mr
Feinstein's words, by making hysterical  charges  about  media  conspiracies
and the opposition,  instead  of  dealing  with  the  issues  and  demanding
accountability of people in Government, including the Deputy President.

South Africa is tired of these bully-boy tactics. Even Minister Pahad's  own
ANC colleagues are apparently tired of them. So, we say to him: Who  do  you
think you are,  Minister  Pahad,  to  drag  this  nation's  democracy,  this
Constitution and this representative National Assembly down into the mud?

It is time for Parliament to stand up to this blustering and this  bullying,
and to open a nonpartisan, comprehensive inquiry  which  once  and  for  all
will reveal what happened under the arms deal, and who  is  responsible  for
all the allegations, the corruption and the misdemeanours which are  now  in
the public arena. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

      EFFECT OF LEGISLATION ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON PRIVATE SECTOR

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M V NGEMA (IFP): Madam Speaker, the Promotion of  Access  to  Information
Act is one of the cornerstones of the  free,  open  and  democratic  society
that has been created in South Africa since 1994. The right of our  citizens
to access to information held by the state and the private  sector  for  the
exercising and protection of any of the rights  enshrined  in  our  Bill  of
Rights is in  itself  an  individual  right  associated  with  a  democratic
constitutional dispensation.

Among other things, the Act  provided  that  all  affected  parties  had  to
submit manuals to the Human Rights Commission by  August  this  year.  These
manuals have to include information about a variety of aspects  relating  to
the business of a private-sector  company,  including  what  information  it
holds and how access can be gained to it.

Large companies with hundreds or thousands of employees have not really  had
much of a problem meeting the deadline for submission of the manuals to  the
HRC. In many instances the requirements of the Act have  created  a  cottage
industry  of  lawyers  and  consultants  who  prepare  the  manuals  for   a
substantial fee which a large company can easily absorb into  its  operating
budget.

The situation has not been the same for small businesses. In many  instances
these companies were not aware of their obligations under the Act. Many  did
not know how to go about dealing with their obligations. Others  simply  did
not have the money to pay consultants or to absorb  the  costs  of  printing
the manuals in the Gazette. Rumours of heavy fines ... [Time expired.]

        COMMEMORATION OF 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNITED DEMOCRATIC FRONT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D A  A  OLIPHANT  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  on  20  August  2003  the  ANC
commemorated the 20th anniversary of the United Democratic  Front.  The  UDF
was founded by the  liberation  movement  at  a  critical  juncture  in  our
struggle when many people's organisations  had  been  banned  and  when  the
experiences of the people signalled the need for  a  broad  front  of  anti-
apartheid organisations.

The  UDF  united  the  masses  in  political  action,  benefiting  from  and
reinforcing the work of underground structures,  armed  combatants  and  the
global anti-apartheid movement. Under the  slogan  ``UDF  unites,  apartheid
divides'',  the  UDF  brought  together  organisations  of   women,   youth,
communities,     workers,     professionals,     religious      communities,
anticonscription campaigners and others across class, colour, religious  and
other divides in the struggle against colonialism  and  apartheid,  and  for
the creation of a united, nonracial, nonsexist,  democratic  and  prosperous
society. This remains the strategic objective  of  the  national  liberation
movement led by the ANC.

We dip our banners in memory of those cadres  and  activists  who  paid  the
supreme sacrifice for the conditions we are privileged to enjoy  today,  and
therefore we want to reiterate our statement that the tide  has  turned  and
steadily but surely a better life  is  becoming  a  reality.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

               ALLEGED RACIAL INCIDENT AT RUGBY TRAINING CAMP

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr S SIMMONS (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Speaker, die  beweerde  rassevoorval  in
rugby waarin Geo  Cronjé  en  Quinton  Davids  se  name  genoem  is  en  die
hantering van die voorval doen die sport  en  alle  ondersteuners  'n  oneer
aan. Dit plaas nie net 'n vraagteken oor rasseverhoudings in  hierdie  sport
nie, maar ook oor die breë Suid-Afrikaanse gemeenskap. Weens die  agtergrond
van die betrokke spelers is aanvalle ook op sekere gemeenskappe geloods.

Hierdie onsmaaklike voorval behoort tot op die been oopgevlek te word  omdat
dit twee spelers van internasionale gehalte se loopbane in gevaar  stel.  As
die feite nie vasgestel word nie, sal dit net  die  indruk  by  die  publiek
skep dat die hele voorval onder die mat ingevee word. Vandag  het  die  span
se kommunikasiehoof bedank omdat hy sê hy nie deel van  'n  groep  kan  wees
wat vooroordele verduur nie. Volgens die  redes  vir  sy  bedanking  is  dit
duidelik dat die hele storie oor die voorval nog nie bekend is nie.

Die Nuwe NP doen 'n beroep op die Minister van Sport en  Ontspanning  om  'n
onafhanklike ondersoekpaneel aan  te  wys  om  die  saak  en  die  hantering
daarvan te ondersoek. Ondanks die bewerings wat gemaak is en  die  hantering
daarvan, steun die Nuwe  NP  die  Springbokspan  wat  aan  die  Wêreldbeker-
rugbytoernooi in Australië gaan deelneem. Die Nuwe NP  se  bloed  is  groen!
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr S SIMMONS (New NP): Madam Speaker, the alleged racial incident in  rugby
in which the names of Geo Cronjé and Quinton Davies were mentioned, as  well
as  the  handling  of  the  incident,  dishonours  the  sport  and  all  its
supporters. It puts a question mark, not only  over  race  relations  within
this sport but also over the broader South African community. Owing  to  the
backgrounds of  the  respective  players,  attacks  were  also  launched  on
certain communities.

This distasteful incident needs to be  examined  in  great  depth  since  it
jeopardises the careers of two players  of  international  stature.  If  the
facts are not established, this will only create the  impression  among  the
public that the whole incident is being swept under the  carpet.  Today  the
team's head of communications resigned because he felt that he could not  be
part of a  group  that  tolerated  prejudices.  From  the  reasons  for  his
resignation it is evident that the whole story about the  incident  has  not
yet been divulged.

The New NP calls on the Minister of  Sport  and  Recreation  to  appoint  an
independent panel to investigate the issue, and  the  way  it  was  handled.
Despite the allegations made and the way  they  were  handled,  the  New  NP
supports the Springbok team that is going to participate in  the  World  Cup
Rugby  Tournament  in  Australia.  The  blood  of  the  New  NP  is   green!

              LAND AFFAIRS - EFFECTS OF POLICY ON VALUE OF LAND

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, with regard to the question  of  the
value of land in this country, I think that members of the House should  not
create unnecessary confusion.

There is nothing in the policy of Government today which contributes to  the
reduction of the value of land. Every one of the  restitution  cases  begins
with negotiations with the individuals who bought  expropriated  land  under
the old regime, and those negotiations lead to consensus  on  the  price  of
the land that is going to be returned to the owners.

It is only in extremely exceptional cases,  where  some  individuals  resist
even such a reasonable approach of negotiating  and  compensating  them  for
the land which they bought under the horrible and inhumane policies  of  the
old government, that we then resort to expropriation.

There can be no alternative to returning land to its  rightful  owners,  and
where individuals are not prepared to co-operate with this  most  reasonable
approach,  it  cannot  be  said  that  Government  is  contributing  to  the
reduction of the value of land.

I think the UCDP must avoid making statements which are  dangerous,  because
they are not sensitive to history. I know of no land that  was  expropriated
but was not made available to one section of the population.  In  the  whole
of the Free State and  the  whole  of  the  old  Transvaal,  when  land  was
expropriated, Africans were driven  off  that  land  and  it  was  given  to
whites.

Today, we seek to correct that. It is not possible to take land from  blacks
who were not given land by the old regime. You can't. There is  no  land  to
take from blacks and give to somebody else.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Your time has expired, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: That was the first question. I've  got  the  second
question to deal with.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay.

              MINIMUM WAGE STIPULATION USED TO RETRENCH WORKERS

                            (Minister's response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, on the question  of  minimum  wages,
only last week we had a most successful and fruitful  meeting  with  AgriSA,
dealing, among other things, with some of the issues such  as  this  minimum
wage, and I must report to the House that AgriSA was extremely  appreciative
of the fact ...

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker, on a point of order:  The  hon  Minister  is
enlightening the House, but it's on matters which have nothing  to  do  with
his portfolio and, as far as I'm concerned, nothing to do with  the  cluster
in which he serves. [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister, are you responding in  the  context
of your cluster?

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Yes, indeed, Madam Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Okay. Please proceed, then.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: A lot of the restitution that  is  happening  today
is being dealt with between myself and Agriculture and, in  any  event,  the
executive has got collective responsibility for all the ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Minister,  on  that  issue,  the  Rules  that
guide the statements by members of Parliament  are  explicit  on  the  issue
that Ministers must please respond on their portfolios. However, if it is  a
matter within the cluster that you are part of, the Minister is then  within
his rights.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I think I started by clarifying that  issue,  Madam
Speaker. If Mr Gibson follows the question of land restitution,  he'll  know
that one of the key issues in which we are  involved  in  Defence,  is  this
issue.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister,  could  you  please  now  respond  to  the
second question? Continue with your response to the second question.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: May I now start on my two minutes?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, please continue, because you had started.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Well, to make my input very short  with  regard  to
this matter, the largest portion of South  Africa's  farming  community  has
expressed itself as very happy with the approach to minimum wages. They  say
they appreciate that this minimum wage improves  the  living  conditions  of
their workers and, therefore, helps in the fight against crime.

If there is any member of the House who has a  complaint  about  this  issue
with regard to farmworkers, I invite them to the next meeting when  we  meet
with AgriSA and other farming organisations.

               ALLEGED RACIAL INCIDENT AT RUGBY TRAINING CAMP

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Thank you very much,  Deputy  Speaker.
Well, I think, first of all, that my colleague is  quite  correct.  We  take
collective responsibility. More so, he is in the same  cluster.  Lastly,  he
is a farmer himself. [Laughter.]

So, for my past, let me respond quickly to the New NP. My appeal,  first  of
all, is to all South Africans. The appeal I am  making  is  that  we  should
become rational in dealing with this issue. It is of no use to just jump  up
here, like Donald Lee, and say whatever you want to say. It's not  going  to
help the situation.
Allegations of racism are not to be treated lightly, whatever their  origins
are. We should also add that our international and national players  in  all
our codes of sport should be above reproach and should  be  of  the  highest
standing in our communities. Therefore, we will not, in sport, tolerate  any
alleged racism rearing its ugly head. We will not tolerate that in sport.

Let me finish by saying that the proposal that has been made by the  New  NP
is a very good one, and I will take it up after I've  met  with  rugby  this
afternoon. They'll give me a report and I'll take  it  up  with  them,  that
more investigations need to be made into this whole issue.

I do hope that our focus now will be on  the  team  preparation.  All  South
Africans, I hope, will give their full support to the cream  of  our  rugby,
as it leaves our shores to do battle in  the  World  Cup.  That's  what  our
focus should be on at the moment. Thank you. [Applause.]

     MINISTER ESSOP PAHAD'S CONDUCT IN REGARD TO ARMS DEAL INVESTIGATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY:  Madam  Speaker,  I  see  that  the  hon
Leader of the Opposition is no longer here. I was  not  intending  to  bully
him and there was no particular need for  him  to  run  away.  I  can't,  as
Government, really  explain  why  the  opposition  should  feel  bullied  by
Minister Essop Pahad, who is such a gentleman! [Interjections.] However,  if
they are hurt by that, that seems to be its politics.

I think the Government has been quite clear on its position.  At  all  times
we have allowed the due processes to take place  with  regard  to  the  arms
deal, and we will continue to do so.

The problem with the DA or the Democratic Party - I forget what they  are  -
is that they have no respect for any of  the  organisations  and  structures
set up by this Constitution. If the finding is inconvenient  to  them,  they
want to come and make more allegations in Parliament.  Why  don't  you  just
sit and wait for the process to be conducted and see  what  the  outcome  is
for a change? [Interjections.]

                 BROAD-BASED BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  colleagues,  the
heads of the various Council of Trade and  Industry  institutions  that  are
with us today and will be central in implementing this Bill, the members  of
the task team who helped me so greatly in the last months and have  assisted
so effectively: The tabling of this Bill  in  Parliament  today  is  another
important step in the economic revolution  that  the  new  democratic  South
Africa has been engaged in since 1994.

The legacy of apartheid leaves us with particularly difficult challenges  in
the  development  of  new  enterprises   and   increasing   the   depth   of
participation  by  black  persons  in  the  economy.  By  restricting  skill
development, by expropriating land, wealth and assets,  and  by  restricting
business opportunities for the  majority,  colonialism  and  apartheid  laid
barren the fields of wealth creation and opportunity for that majority.

Structurally such an economy could never prosper. To grow  and  develop  our
country requires an economy that can meet the needs  of  all  our  citizens,
our people and their enterprises, in a sustainable manner.  This  will  only
be possible if our economy builds on the full potential of all  persons  and
communities across the length and breadth of this country.

Starting with  the  RDP,  we  have  systematically  addressed  this  legacy.
However, it became evident that we had to address  more  systematically  the
participation of black people in the mainstream of  economic  activity,  and
within the corporations and enterprises,  including  co-operative  forms  of
enterprise, in this economy. This realisation led to the  formation  of  the
Black Economic Empowerment Council,  and  their  path-breaking  report.  The
Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Bill is the outcome of this process.

A policy approach for  empowerment  is  complex  and  has  to  balance  many
economic processes and forces, not  all  of  which  make  empowerment  easy.
After careful consideration the framework of the BEE policy was released  by
the DTI  on  behalf  of  Government  on  19  March  2003,  and  Parliament's
Portfolio Committee on Trade and  Industry  adopted  the  Broad-Based  Black
Economic Empowerment Bill on 20 August 2003. After public hearings  we  have
been able to make a number of important and constructive  amendments,  which
I am sure Dr Davis and others will cover in their addresses.

The Bill is in essence enabling legislation that  creates  a  framework  for
the development and implementation of black economic empowerment policy.  It
does this by the important mechanisms of the advisory  council,  a  strategy
document, codes of good  practice  and  the  publication  of  transformation
charters. This is an innovative  response  to  what  will  be  an  important
learning and developmental process that cannot  be  held  within  the  tight
confines of detailed legislation and regulation, but where there is  also  a
need for more certainty and clarity of purpose.

In the hearings there was a concern that the empowerment  process  must  not
have too narrow a  base  of  beneficiaries.  This  is  a  concern  that  the
Government shares, but we have to balance this against  the  fact  that  the
Bill cannot embrace all the programmes and actions introduced by  Government
to redress the inequity that was historically imposed  on  the  majority  of
our people. I believe that the amendments find this balance.  The  Bill  has
been  amended  to  ensure  that  the  law  targets  a  broader  spectrum  of
beneficiaries.

The concept of empowerment is not one-dimensional  and  is  a  process  that
should result in both higher levels  of  black  ownership  as  well  as  the
reduction in income  inequalities.  It  should  result  in  effective  black
participation in  the  economy,  reflected  in  both  a  broadening  of  the
entrepreneurial   base   and   increased   participation   in    managerial,
professional and other skilled occupations.

The  BEE  process  will  therefore  include  elements  of   human   resource
development,  employment  equity,   enterprise   development,   preferential
procurement, as well as investment, ownership  and  control  of  enterprises
and economic assets. I believe that the objectives of the Bill  will  define
the ambit of endeavour of BEE, and make it clear that  the  facilitation  of
economic possibilities in urban, rural and local communities is part of  the
concept of a broad-based empowerment process.

As indicated earlier,  this  Bill  is  innovative  in  that  it  essentially
provides the enabling environment for the implementation of a strategy.  The
efficacy of the strategy lies in the ability of Government to  use  its  own
economic position to  shape  the  behaviour  of  the  private  sector  in  a
transparent and co-ordinated manner towards  certain  objectives.  In  doing
this, it works with the market and not  against  it,  but  in  doing  so  it
achieves objectives that the market would not  achieve  or  would  certainly
achieve too slowly.

There is now a realisation that we will not have growth and  development  if
we  cannot  ensure  that  all  our  citizens  are  active   and   meaningful
participants  in  the  economy,  and  have  equal   opportunity   for   such
participation.  This  allows  a  common  purpose  around  which  the   state
intervenes in a developmental manner to ensure that  the  larger  collective
benefits of growth and development will be generated and shared by all.

This  developmental  and  growth-orientated  approach   is   and   must   be
fundamental to our understanding of the process and  how  we  implement  it.
BEE is not an imposition, but the opening of opportunities that  the  market
itself  would  have  inadequately  realised.  The  new  Act   provides   the
instruments to implement, monitor and sensibly  adjust  by  consultation  as
the process unfolds.

The instruments are the establishment  of  the  Black  Economic  Empowerment
Advisory Council as an advisory body to allow for stakeholder  participation
in  the  formulation,  monitoring  and  implementation  of  Black   Economic
Empowerment policy; the ability of the  Minister  to  issue  codes  of  good
practice on black economic empowerment that must also be taken into  account
by organs of state; and the ability of the Minister to issue guidelines  for
the development of transformation  charters  by  different  sectors  of  the
economy. Such charters would need to include specific mechanisms to  achieve
BEE objectives in that sector, in a comprehensive  and  appropriate  manner,
as well as provide measurement indicators and targets.

The  Bill  also  empowers  the  Minister  to  publish  in  the  Gazette  the
transformation charter for a particular sector of the economy.  This  is  in
essence the scorecard approach that has been  adopted.  The  publication  of
the strategy document provides a  flexible  but  authoritative  vehicle  for
articulating policy and guiding public and private sector  participation  in
BEE.

Since the publishing of the strategy document in March we have already  seen
many developments which confirm the wisdom of  allowing  for  a  stable  but
evolving approach. Different forms of ownership participation have  emerged.
As the scorecard approach unfolds, so the question of how  this  works  over
time arises, and we have had to address the varied corporate  strategies  of
large multinationals through to small family-owned enterprises. All have  to
be treated within the same framework but with flexibility that accords  with
their economic positions.

We have a very diverse economy and a very sophisticated  one  at  that.  The
need for the public sector to be more uniform in its  approach  has  emerged
strongly. In  all  this  we  continuously  have  to  balance  the  need  for
certainty with that  of  being  flexible  in  the  face  of  commercial  and
financial good sense. In the financing of  BEE  there  have  also  been  new
approaches. As we indicated in the strategy document, financing of BEE  must
also deal with some of  the  macro  aspects  of  the  capital  market.  This
requires us to co-ordinate our efforts and ensure that  we  have  the  right
products for the right purpose.

The IDC has done good work on this and new products will  become  available.
In the DTI we have had a fresh look at the  National  Empowerment  Fund  and
it, too, will make certain  new  products  available  that  will  complement
those of the IDC and the private sector. I am pleased to  announce  that  as
of yesterday Sydney Maree has agreed to take up the position of  acting  CEO
of the National Empowerment Fund to complete this process.

We are therefore confident that we can manage a process  that  leverages  in
private sector financing in a manner that is sustainable and  that  promotes
growth and stable capital markets. I believe that within the private  sector
we now have a sense of common purpose that this is a  common  task  that  we
must all embark upon for  our  common  good.  There  has  been  a  flood  of
approaches and initiatives that Government has been asked to comment on.

Multinational companies as a whole, and  often  by  their  national  origin,
have considered BEE, and are making constructive and  exciting  inputs.  The
Oppenheimer family has had the courage of their  convictions  and  has  made
concrete  proposals  in  public  to  advance  the  process,  the   so-called
Brenthurst Initiative. As one would expect  and  welcome  in  South  Africa,
there  have  been  intense  debates  on  the  politics   and   efficacy   of
Government's approach.

I want to stress once again that what drives our policy is that  equity  and
participation by all are the real drivers of growth and development.  It  is
growth and development that are the final nail in the  coffin  of  apartheid
and the first in building a new and  prosperous  democracy.  Hard  work  and
goodwill are required to build a  strong,  nonracial,  nonsexist,  equitable
and sustainable economy. There are no magic formulae  or  quick-fixes;  only
the determination and vision of our people.

I would like to express  the  gratitude  of  the  Government  to  the  Black
Economic  Empowerment  Council,  chaired  by  Cyril  Ramaphosa,  for   their
pioneering work and commitment to this worthy cause. Many have continued  to
work hard - and they sit up there today - in the task team to which the  DTI
and Government owe a great  deal.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  portfolio
committee under Dr Rob Davies, which once  again  has  done  its  work  with
professionalism and insight. I really don't know what  the  DTI  would  have
done without such a fine committee.

Finally, thanks from the Deputy Minister and myself to the team in the  DTI,
led by Deputy Director-General Lionel October and  Bulisiwe  Buthelezi,  for
their tireless and intellectually thorough  commitment  to  the  purpose  of
this Bill.

I believe we are adding another  crucial  dimension  to  the  programmes  of
economic transformation and restructuring that will  ensure  our  future.  I
commend this Bill to the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms F HAJAIG: Deputy Speaker, Minister Erwin, Cabinet members,  comrades  and
colleagues, it gives me great pleasure to introduce  the  Broad-Based  Black
Economic Empowerment Bill to you. I would like to dedicate this input to  my
very dear comrade, Ntombi Shope, who was a member of our committee  and  was
very passionate about empowerment for the  disadvantaged,  especially  black
women. We shall miss you, Ntombi.

Before I outline the objectives and the architecture of the  Bill,  I  think
it is in order to begin with the historical context, so that one  can  fully
understand the rationale for this Bill.

Apartheid systematically and purposefully restricted the majority  of  South
Africans from  meaningful  participation  in  the  economy.  The  assets  of
millions were directly or indirectly destroyed, and access to skills and  to
self-employment was racially  restricted.  The  accumulation  process  under
apartheid confined the creation of wealth to a racial minority, and  imposed
underdevelopment on black communities.
The result is an economic structure  that  today  still  excludes  the  vast
majority of South Africans. It is crucial to  understand  the  magnitude  of
what took place in our past, in order to  understand  why  we  need  to  act
together as a nation to  bring  about  an  economic  transformation  in  the
interests of all South Africans. Despite the economic successes  since  1994
and a broad range of state  policy,  strategy  and  programme  interventions
aimed at overcoming economic disparities, entrenched  inequalities  continue
to characterise the economy and act  as  a  deterrent  to  growth,  economic
development, employment creation and poverty eradication.

Vast racial and gender inequalities in the distribution  of  and  access  to
wealth, income, skills and employment persist. As a consequence our  economy
continues to perform below its full potential. More than  just  an  economic
imperative, the deracialisation and engendering of our economy  is  a  moral
requirement in keeping with the values and principles  of  equity  enshrined
in our Constitution. We will no longer be just hewers of  wood  and  drawers
of water as Verwoerd wanted us to be.

South Africa is a developmental state, and  so  it  is  imperative  for  the
Government to intervene in the  economy  to  make  a  better  life  for  its
people. Government with this Bill can  provide  sustained  intervention  for
the empowerment of the majority of its disadvantaged citizens.

Coming to the Bill itself, a  few  definitions  are  in  order.  Broad-based
black economic empowerment means  the  economic  empowerment  of  all  black
people. That includes African, Indian  and  coloured  people,  and  includes
women, workers, youth, people with disabilities and people living  in  rural
areas.

The Bill seeks, firstly, to broaden the entrepreneurial base, and to  extend
black participation in the  economy  as  measured  in  terms  of  ownership,
management  and  skills  development.  It  also  seeks  to   develop   local
communities and employees, and to reduce income  inequalities  and  poverty,
amongst other things.
Chapter 2 of the Bill states that its objectives  are  to  promote  economic
transformation - transformation for the majority and not just for  the  few;
to change the racial composition of ownership, management and structures  of
existing and new  enterprises;  to  increase  ownership  and  management  by
communities,  workers  and  co-operatives;  to  promote  investment  in  the
enterprises  owned  and  managed  by  black   people;   to   empower   rural
communities; to increase the extent to which  black  women  own  and  manage
existing and new enterprises, and  to  increase  their  access  to  economic
activities, infrastructure and skills training.

Black women in our country  are  the  poorest  of  the  poor.  According  to
Statistics South Africa, a survey done in 2002 shows that 38,2%  of  African
women are unemployed, 26,7% of  coloured  women  are  unemployed,  21,6%  of
Indian women are unemployed and only 7,8% of  white  women  are  unemployed.
The majority of black women still work on the  outer  fringes,  not  in  the
core activities of the economy.

The final objective of this Bill is to promote access to finance  for  black
economic empowerment and the Minister has outlined this. Access  to  finance
has always been a stumbling block, despite us engaging  with  the  banks  in
this regard. Banks have been reluctant to give credit to  small  businesses,
and the development of small and micro entrepreneurship has not  really  got
off the ground.

The Bill does all of the above by the establishment of  the  Black  Economic
Empowerment Advisory Council, chaired by the  President.  The  council  will
comprise the President, three Cabinet Ministers, the Minister of  Trade  and
Industry, and ten to fifteen other members  who  will  include  stakeholders
from labour, business,  academia,  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders.  A  large
segment of the council, as you can see, will be members of civil society.

The Minister will establish a constitution and regulations for the  council.
Support services and funding for the council will come from  the  Department
of Trade and Industry. The Minister of Trade and Industry  is  empowered  to
issue codes of good practice. The codes of good practice may include,  among
other things, the  qualification  criteria  for  preferential  purposes  for
procurement and other economic activities,  and  perhaps  more  importantly,
indicators to measure broad-based black economic  empowerment.  These  codes
of practice must be taken into  account  by  all  organs  of  state,  public
entities,  the  private  sector,  NGOs  and  other  stakeholders  when  they
develop, adopt and implement programmes.

Different sectors of the economy must be encouraged  to  develop  their  own
transformation charters. The Minister will provide a strategy so that  there
is a  co-ordinated  and  uniform  approach  to  broad-based  black  economic
empowerment.

In the recent Growth and Development Summit 2003 document, it is  gratifying
to note that in chapter 4.2.2, business specifically  confirms  its  support
for  the  advancement  of  equity  and  the  promotion  of  BEE.  Business's
commitment will manifest itself in a proactive  strategy  of  transformation
to foster and encourage economic empowerment.
Targets and timeframes for achieving our goal are important  and  necessary.
The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that as many people  as  possible  can
derive benefit from these measures. Underlying all our efforts to  intervene
concretely and  provide  an  enabling  environment  is  the  eradication  of
poverty, and it will remain our  goal  until  that  scourge  is  wiped  out.
Political freedom, as important as it is, means very  little  to  the  cold,
starving, unsheltered and  marginalised  when  parents  are  unemployed  and
children still go to bed hungry.

In the President's words, the First World arm of our economy has  done  well
since 1994. Now we would  like  to  see  the  Third  World  economy  of  our
country, which affects the majority of our people, take off and  blossom.  I
hope that all parties that have the growth of the  country,  the  growth  of
the economy and poverty eradication at heart will see fit  to  support  this
Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  C  M  LOWE:  Deputy  Speaker,  thank  you.  Decades  of  apartheid   and
institutionalised racial discrimination make black economic  empowerment  an
imperative. To quote the Institute of Race Relations' John Kane-Berman:


  This means finding ways in which millions who suffered under apartheid, a
  great many of whom still endure poverty, ignorance and disease, can enjoy
  a place in the sun with a stake in the economy and society.

There is much to be done. Unemployment is at 42%. Three out  of  every  five
South Africans live below the poverty line. The poorest 50% of  people  were
even poorer in  2000  than  they  were  in  1995.  Forty  per  cent  of  the
population have completed only primary school and 18% have no  schooling  at
all. The poorest 41% earn only 10% of South Africa's income.

A decade into our democracy these figures  brutally  expose  the  challenges
facing South Africa and the myth of a  better  life  for  all.  The  gap  in
income between rich and poor blacks is greater than ever and  we  have  seen
the massive enrichment of an elite, but well-connected few in  the  name  of
what passes for black economic empowerment. But for  the  vast  majority  of
black South Africans, the frontier of poverty is  chillingly  close  by  and
they remain as marginalised as ever. Political freedom  has  not  of  itself
brought economic freedom.

The Democratic Alliance strongly supports efforts to transform  our  economy
and empower the millions of South Africans excluded by apartheid. But  these
must  be  genuine  efforts  at  their  very  heart  which  tackle   poverty,
unemployment and inadequate education. They must empower the  many  and  not
just the few. Thus any broad-based black economic empowerment strategy  must
focus on job creation and entrepreneurship as its key measurables if  it  is
to make any difference to the lives of  those  millions  of  South  Africans
still excluded by the past.

And that is why the ANC's current effort of black economic empowerment  will
fail, because the ANC is less interested in helping the poor and far  keener
on helping itself. While the DA is for the many, the ANC  is  for  the  few.
[Interjections.] Until it starts really to empower the  many  and  not  just
the few, Minister, the ANC's promise of a better life for  all  is  actually
no more than  just  ``a  better  life  for  us''  -  a  shameful  record  of
extravagant lives and lifestyles that appear more and more in  the  face  of
growing unemployment and poverty. And so this  Bill  will  fail  because  it
does not focus on job creation as its key measurable.

Justifiably it's been criticised by Cosatu for  its  narrow  focus,  and  by
Moeletsi Mbeki who argues that BEE is  just  a  tool  to  fulfil  the  ANC's
political agenda rather than a model for creating  entrepreneurs.  The  Bill
will fail because  of  its  overly  and  unworkably  prescriptive  reporting
requirements and discretionary powers vested in the  Minister,  and  because
the  empowerment  requirements  for  foreign  entities  remain   unresolved.
Together  this  will  deter  local  entrepreneurs  and  chase  away  foreign
investment to Brazil, to  China  and  to  India.  Jobs  will  be  lost,  not
created.

The Bill  will  fail  because  it  evades  the  key  question  of  financing
empowerment and because it neglects to link our crucial skills  crisis  with
job creation and empowerment opportunities. A recent survey by Deloitte  and
Touche found that South African companies  are  battling  to  find  suitably
qualified  affirmative  action  candidates  at  an   executive   level   and
struggling to hold on to those people that they do employ.  By  focusing  on
broadening our skills base, Government will  unlock  the  potential  of  our
economy to grow at the kind of levels  to  absorb  the  massive  numbers  of
unemployed people in our country.

The Bill will fail because its definition of black South Africans opens  the
door to massive manipulation and abuse of  so-called  empowerment  deals  by
powerful, connected ANC cronies and frontmen who  qualify  as  disadvantaged
while leaving the broad mass of people just as marginalised  as  ever.  It's
not surprising that only a handful of well-connected and already  relatively
wealthy businessmen and -women  support  the  ANC's  approach.  As  we  have
increasingly seen from so-called empowerment deals, they are the  only  ones
that stand to benefit from it in any meaningful way.

This Bill will fail because it  puts  economic  growth  and  empowerment  in
competition with one another. President Mbeki is quite wrong when he  writes
- as if it were a fact - that higher rates of growth of 6% and  above  would
not of themselves reduce unemployment levels.  That  is  nonsense.  Economic
growth is the only sure way of addressing poverty and joblessness.  And  the
President has travelled far enough around the world to have  seen  this  for
himself.

The Bill will fail because it seeks to increase  growth,  create  more  jobs
and deliver  more  equitable  income  distribution  simply  by  transferring
existing equity, while ignoring the need to attract investment and  increase
the equity pool. It will  ultimately  fail  because  it  only  propagates  a
better life for some and not a better life for all.  Far  from  being  broad
based, it narrowly focuses on a few people from the advantaged and elite.

In contrast,  the  Democratic  Alliance's  vision  of  broad-based  economic
empowerment is to  give  people  access  to  skills  and  opportunities,  to
realise their full potential and take  control  of  and  responsibility  for
their own lives. This Thursday, when the DA launches its empowerment  policy
entitled ``Opportunity for All'', we will show how jobs, jobs and more  jobs
are the key to broad-based empowerment and are the surest way of  empowering
the marginalised and the poor.  We  will  demonstrate  the  two  fundamental
concepts to the DA's approach: equal opportunity for  all,  and  merit,  not
race. These arise from our commitment to democracy, equality before the  law
and the freedom, worth and dignity of every individual.

The DA will empower people by ensuring that they have access to  skills  and
opportunity, are objectively judged on their merits and are able  to  fulfil
their full potential. Properly implemented economic  empowerment  can  be  a
partnership for success for all South  Africans,  together  with  innovative
policies such as employee stock  options  and  the  rapid  privatisation  of
parastatals, giving employees shares in these enterprises. We  will  address
the skills  crisis  by  scrapping  the  detrimental  race  quota  system  on
professions and jobs requiring scarce  skills,  immediately  attracting  new
skills which in turn will create new employment and  training  opportunities
for unskilled South Africans.

Our policy will introduce entrepreneurial and practical business courses  at
schools from an early age, with a massive roll-out  of  training  programmes
to help retrain retrenched workers and assist unskilled people to make  them
employable.  You  see,  sustainable  job  creation  does  result  from   new
investment and economic growth, and will be at the very heart  of  the  DA's
empowerment programme. Until President Mbeki admits this and his  Government
takes it seriously and gears  everything  it  does  towards  this  end,  the
jobless queues he encountered on the  streets  of  South  Africa  this  past
weekend will only get  longer,  while  the  ANC  cronies  enrich  themselves
further in the name of black economic empowerment.

For these reasons the Democratic  Alliance  is  in  favour  of  radical  and
transcending change, the kind of  positive  change  that  will  dramatically
improve our economy  and  society.  We  believe  that  broad-based  economic
empowerment is important, is necessary and desirable and that  deracialising
ownership of large listed companies is welcome, but is  also  no  substitute
for broad-based empowerment which must address the urgent needs of  ordinary
people at grass-roots level.

The DA believes that jobs are the surest way of empowering the  marginalised
and the poor, and  that  empowerment  criteria  such  as  race,  gender  and
disability should be plus factors, but  not  the  sole  considerations  when
affirmative action appointments are made or contracts  awarded.  We  believe
that affirmative action legislation should incorporate  sunset  clauses  and
that empowerment should, wherever possible, be on a  nonracial  basis.  This
is because, Minister, our racist and terrible past still often  divides  us.
Some people are disappointed and frustrated  because  they  had  hoped  that
democracy would  bring  them  new  opportunities  immediately.  Others  feel
threatened because they fear that  they  could  become  victims  of  reverse
discrimination.
Empowering disadvantaged individuals is not easy because affirmative  action
is  an  extremely  complex  and  sensitive  issue  with  the  potential   to
facilitate healing, but also the potential to sow seeds  of  new  bitterness
in our diverse society. If we  are  to  move  forward,  we  dare  not  allow
anything to perpetuate or exacerbate the deep  divides  in  our  society  or
create new lines of division. Greater participation and ownership  by  black
South Africans in the economy is wholly desirable and long overdue, but  for
millions and millions  of  desperately  poor  South  Africans  participation
starts with a job and creating jobs for  them  is  not  just  desirable  but
imperative.

As long as Government focuses on the transfer of existing equity instead  of
transformation through economic growth and job creation, as long as the  ANC
keeps protecting the few and forgetting  the  many,  until  the  ANC  starts
helping the poor and stops helping themselves,  black  economic  empowerment
will remain a short-cut to wealth for the very few and a myth to  those  who
deserve and need it the most. Thank you. [Applause.]
Mr B C NGIBA: Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  The  question  of  black
economic empowerment is a crucial one for the future of democracy  in  South
Africa. It would be futile to think that the achievement of political  power
by the majority in 1994 could be sustainable and long-lasting  if  that  was
the only fruit of liberation for the majority.

For many decades the majority had been excluded from  participating  in  the
economy to any meaningful extent, save perhaps for the  provision  of  cheap
labour on which much of our modern industrialised  economy  is  built.  That
exclusion cannot be tolerated within a democracy.

Since 1994, and  even  slightly  before  that,  it  has  become  clear  that
meaningful BEE would have to take  place  to  secure  democracy  and  social
stability  into  the  future.  It  also  became  clear  quite  quickly  that
voluntary empowerment initiatives were  limited  in  their  application  and
success rate, thus the  need  for  Government  intervention  in  the  market
through legislation.

But there is a further reason beyond stability that makes BEE  a  necessity.
For the past decade, South Africa's economy has grown, but not at the  rates
that are required effectively to address deepseated poverty, job losses  and
the  accompanying  social  weaknesses.  BEE,  in  broadening  ownership  and
participation by the majority in the overall economy, has the  potential  to
be an effective driver for accelerated economic growth and job creation.  It
can therefore be said that BEE is definitely in the national interest.

That being said, the question must be asked why legislation  is  needed  for
something as obviously  strategic  and  important  as  BEE.  The  answer  is
twofold. Firstly,  successive  apartheid  governments  used  legislation  to
exclude the majority from participation in the economy;  and  secondly,  the
first wave of BEE that started in the early nineties has  had  only  limited
success  as  far  as  its  scope  and  benefits  are  concerned.  Taken   in
combination, these two reasons provide  enough  justification  to  legislate
for BEE.

BEE  has  to  achieve  certain  minimum  conditions  for  it  to  be  judged
successful over the medium term. Among other things, these  are  accelerated
economic  growth,  large-scale  job  creation,   skills   development,   the
alleviation of  poverty  -  especially  in  our  rural  areas  -  management
participation for the majority, equity ownership, and general  participation
by everyone in economic activities, not only the select few who are  at  the
head of empowerment consortiums.

At the same time there are many potential pitfalls that must be avoided  for
BEE to be successful. Some of these are  excessive  Government  interference
in a market economy that could lead to distortions,  inflexibility  of  laws
and regulations, excessive red tape and bureaucratic tangles  that  increase
compliance costs and the cost of doing profitable business,  uncertainty  in
the  business  operating  environment,  disincentives  to  investment,   and
alienating foreign-based companies doing business in our country.

It is probably much too early to judge whether a piece of  legislation  that
creates a broad  framework  for  BEE  could  or  would  achieve  success  by
avoiding the pitfalls mentioned. Nevertheless, the IFP recognises  the  need
for such legislation and we  will  therefore  support  the  Bill  before  us
today.

In conclusion, Madam Speaker, the Bill  gives  the  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry a large measure of discretionary power. Our hope  is  that  he  and
his successors will use this power wisely, in a balanced manner and  to  the
benefit of all. I thank you.

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  OF  TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:   Madam   Deputy   Speaker,
colleagues, hon members, I  am  surprised  that  the  hon  member  Lowe  has
decided to leave the room. [Interjections.] He is still here, thank  you.  I
would just like to respond to what this hon member has raised. I  have  four
things to say to you, Mr Lowe.

The first is that if you did attend the  portfolio  committee  meetings  you
will know that this Bill is not an end in itself, but a  means  to  an  end.
You would also know that during the public hearings, the majority of  inputs
to the portfolio committee supported the broad-based strategy that  we  have
put forward in this legislation. For me it is only the DA  that  feels  that
the Bill will fail. Indeed, as you say, we intend to use this  as  our  tool
for our agenda, which is not, as  you  said,  a  political  one,  but  about
economic growth, job creation and ending inequalities.

Finally, you talk about the DA that will empower people. I  think  the  only
empowerment that your party can lay claim to is the renting  of  the  masses
of our people for your meetings to follow your leader, in order  to  give  a
sense of mass support in the media. [Laughter.] [Applause].

Regarding   the   Broad-Based   Black   Economic   Empowerment   Bill    ...
[Interjections.] No, just  shut  up,  please!  Can  I  be  protected,  Madam
Speaker? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please allow the Deputy Minister  to
speak.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: The  Broad-Based  Black  Economic
Empowerment Bill  is  a  significant  piece  of  legislation,  as  it  seeks
structurally to transform the  patterns  of  ownership,  management,  skills
levels and enterprises in our economy. The Minister has already outlined  in
his address to this House how the Bill will achieve these objectives,  while
concurrently addressing  the  issues  of  broader  economic  growth  in  our
country.

For me, an important aspect of this Bill is that it starts  to  address  the
need  for  women  entrepreneurs   to   be   included   in   the   structural
transformation of our economy, so that they can  benefit  from  the  changes
that will take place in South Africa as a result of this legislation.  I  do
not need to remind this House of the  negative  impact  that  apartheid  and
colonialism has had  on  black  women  in  South  Africa  -  how  they  were
deskilled and placed in the lowest levels  of  employment  and  economically
disenfranchised. I think the hon member Fatima Hajaig touched on this.

The Bill seeks to achieve black women's equal participation in the  economy.
Clause 2 outlines the objectives of the Bill, which includes increasing  the
extent to which black women own and manage  existing  and  new  enterprises,
and increasing their  access  to  economic  activities,  infrastructure  and
skills training.

Furthermore, clause 9(3) of the Bill highlights  the  need  to  promote  the
achievement of equality of women through issuing a code  of  good  practice.
Such a code should allow for a distinction between black men  and  women  in
the setting of targets.

By incorporating and specifically targeting women, who represent up  to  60%
of small and medium enterprises and survivalist businesses in South  Africa,
this Bill fulfils its mandate of being a broad-based  document  that  starts
to address the  needs  of  the  majority  of  our  people.  However,  it  is
necessary that women, most  of  whom  are  in  the  lower  echelons  of  the
business community, should feel the  impact  of  this  empowerment,  and  be
empowered to move up the value chain and be able to grow their businesses.

It is important for  the  economic  development  of  our  country  that  the
potential of all our people, both men and women, is tapped  into  and  fully
utilised. Therefore the challenge is to ensure that  in  the  implementation
of the Bill women's participation is included in the targets  that  will  be
set and that are currently being set by  industries  and  sectors  in  their
transformation  charters,  particularly   in   the   areas   of   enterprise
development, human resource  development,  procurement,  and  ownership  and
management.

It will thus become necessary for the BEE council that is going  to  be  set
up to ensure that in their monitoring process they  track  the  impact  that
BEE is having on women's enterprises and women  in  the  workplace.  Through
the use of the code of good  practice,  it  will  be  possible  to  set  and
monitor the targets for greater participation by women in broad-based  black
economic empowerment.

Another challenge - a major one,  I  think  -  is  to  ensure  that  support
structures such as the IDC  and  the  National  Empowerment  Fund  that  the
Minister mentioned in his speech are geared towards the support  of  women's
enterprises. In addition, it will be necessary to have  specific  mechanisms
that exclusively target  women's  enterprises  in  the  support  that  these
institutions offer.

Indeed, lack of access to capital has been noted as one of the main  factors
retarding the development of black-owned small  and  medium  enterprises  in
South Africa. A 2002 report on South Africa by the  Global  Entrepreneurship
Monitor rated finance as the second biggest problem facing entrepreneurs  in
South Africa, after structural obstacles.  The  study  said  that  only  one
third of black  people  who  applied  for  finance  got  approval.  Lack  of
collateral was the most  widespread  problem,  facing  45%  of  unsuccessful
applicants, the report noted. These are the challenges  that  both  the  IDC
and the NEF need to address.

Maybe I should mention, hon Minister, that at the recent conference  of  the
ANC Women's League's commission dealing  with  economic  empowerment,  women
called very strongly  for  a  quota  of  the  BEE  funding  to  be  reserved
exclusively for woman-owned businesses. I am expecting that the  women  will
be knocking on your door after this.

While deliberating on the BEE strategy and legislation, women  were  already
calling on us, saying that they know there are  people  who  are  acting  as
fronts for white people and for men, and asking  where  they  should  report
this. I think we have to give the women answers to these questions.

Already women entrepreneurs have started to interrogate the broad-based  BEE
strategy. At a workshop organised by the  SA  Women  Entrepreneurs  Network,
Sawen, women identified potential opportunities arising from this  strategy,
as well as certain challenges posed by the strategy.  Through  Sawen,  women
entrepreneurs were able to make a formal  submission  to  the  parliamentary
Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry  on  these  challenges,  and  were
able to highlight their specific needs, some of which  have  been  addressed
by the amendments.

Organisations such as Sawen  and  other  businesswomen's  associations  will
play a useful role in ensuring that the implementation of the  BEE  strategy
is broad-based, but, most of all, that it does indeed benefit women.

In conclusion, I would  like  to  thank  the  Minister  and  the  team  from
enterprise and industry development for their  efforts  and  the  hard  work
that they have put into this  process.  I  would  also  like  to  thank  the
Portfolio Committee on Trade and  Industry,  particularly  its  chairperson,
for the way that they handled the public hearings  and  for  the  amendments
that they have made to the Bill. In particular,  I  would  like  to  commend
them for ensuring that women's economic  empowerment  and  the  equality  of
women has not only stayed on the agenda, but that an  additional  clause  on
the need for the Bill to promote equality of  women  in  the  code  of  good
practice has been included.

I am pleased to be associated with this Bill, which  indeed  will  transform
our political freedom into economic freedom. And with your support  of  this
Bill, we will be able to achieve the  transformation  and  growth  that  our
country requires. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr R T RHODA: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  practical  economists  and  political
scientists all over the world normally agree that few  countries  have  ever
managed successfully to change the economic and  social  complexion  of  its
population by acts of parliament.

Old South  Africa  went  this  route.  In  the  early  1900s  South  African
legislators, motivated by insecurity and greed, set out unapologetically  to
devise a deliberate defensive bastion  against  black  economic  advancement
and  ensured  that  black  labour  remained  cheap  and  easy  to   control,
especially after the discovery of diamonds and gold.

Faced with the dual problems of white poverty and white  unemployment,  they
proceeded to  achieve  white  economic  empowerment  by  means  of  acts  of
parliament. They used sustained government intervention to keep  blacks  out
of the competitive market, securing jobs and higher  wages  for  themselves.
In fact, a raft of empowerment laws were enacted over the years, as  we  all
know. The structured exclusion of black people from the economic  mainstream
thus began a long time ago.

This systematic  dispossession  and  disempowerment  produced  the  racially
distorted, skewed economic landscape that we are witnessing today - the  two
nations that President Mbeki so often speaks about. We have  two  economies,
a First World economy and a Third World economy.

Yes,  post-apartheid  South  Africa  is   witnessing   deracialisation   and
reconstruction of society on many fronts, but, sadly,  the  economy  remains
profoundly racialised. Much has been achieved since 1994, but we  are  still
trapped   in   a   low-growth   equilibrium,    economic    exclusion    and
underdevelopment.

The extent to which this achieved growth has been shared  equitably  amongst
all South Africans is not yet adequate for the  requirements  of  a  stable,
integrated and prosperous society. There is also no  guarantee  that  higher
levels of growth would automatically lead to a reduction in  the  levels  of
poverty and unemployment.

Our approach to black  economic  empowerment  is  intelligent,  responsible,
soft-edged  and  tempered.  In  my  humble  opinion,  it  is  an  apologetic
approach, too timid, too polite, with no real teeth, not saying what  it  is
that we want to do with any authority, and depending too much on  scorecards
and charters.

Whilst we  have  in  place  empowerment  reporting  systems  and  monitoring
systems for both the private and the public sectors, I  have  doubts  as  to
how effective this will be. For some the excuse is that  a  radical,  rigid,
inflexible, prescriptive approach is not in the interests of  a  modern  and
globally competitive economy. Others, again, say our entry into  the  global
economy has allowed neo-apartheid practices  to  be  camouflaged  by  a  new
discourse, a discourse about the free market and flexibility.

Many  problems  still  need  to  be  solved,   such   as   fronting,   false
declarations, and exploitation of casual and contract  workers  that  allows
employers  to  bypass  labour  legislation,  causing  super-exploitation  of
workers. Then there is intense competition between workers and  supervisors,
overseers and managers, and, of  course,  the  upward-floating  colour  bar,
which allows black people to become supervisors, but deprives  them  of  the
power and privileges that went with those positions before.

We can only hope that  wisdom  will  prevail  and  that  all  South  African
businesses will join hands and make use of this opportunity to help  advance
the economic transformation of this country, and not to isolate  themselves.
Of course, risks will have to be taken, but then, again, that is the  nature
of all business ventures. Let us bake a bigger pie so  that  all  can  share
it.

The New NP supports the Bill. I thank you.

Mr D LOCKEY: Madam Deputy Speaker,  in  his  state  of  the  nation  address
earlier this year, the  President  committed  the  Government  to  a  global
transformation  charter  that  would  allow  for  pragmatism,   flexibility,
certainty and stability. This Bill creates the  legal  framework  to  enable
the Government and state-owned enterprises to actively promote  the  process
of  black  economic  empowerment  within  the  parameters  outlined  by  the
President.

I wish today to address a few themes. The one is our achievements  in  black
economic empowerment as Government over the  past  nine  years.  I  wish  to
argue that black economic empowerment is an imperative in our  society,  and
to address the Government's role in nurturing and supporting black  economic
empowerment and also the issue of empowerment funding.

But let me respond briefly to the hon Lowe. Only  last  week  the  hon  Lowe
stated in the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry that black  economic
empowerment was one of the reasons why we were not  getting  any  investment
in this country, implying that if we wanted investment we  should  not  have
BEE. Today he presents himself as  one  of  the  major  champions  of  black
economic empowerment and the poor. The DA should be the ``DO'' because  they
are ``Dishonest Opportunists''. We all know that  the  DA  has  consistently
opposed all major transformation initiatives by this Government and  we  are
not surprised that they are not in favour of our Bill today.

The hon Lowe stated that BEE has only benefited a small  black  elite.  This
is simply  not  true.  Over  the  last  decade  the  Industrial  Development
Corporation  financed  625  BEE  transactions,   mainly   in   an   unlisted
environment, at a cost of R5,6 billion. All  major  oil  companies  in  this
country have concluded empowerment transactions with broad-based  consortia,
and it is estimated that  18%  of  this  industry  is  now  owned  by  these
consortia.

An average of 80% of fishing quotas in this  country  have  been  issued  to
companies  that  are  majority  black-owned.  There  have  been  significant
advances in mining and the mining charter will no doubt continue to  support
this process. Through  a  preferential  procurement  system  the  state  has
helped  thousands  of  black-owned  companies  to  obtain   contracts   from
Government. State-owned enterprises such as Telkom, Eskom and Transnet  have
also assisted and made a  significant  contribution  to  BEE.  The  ANC  has
indeed helped many who had no opportunities under apartheid.

One of the biggest challenges we face in our young democracy  is  to  create
opportunities for the majority of South Africans to break out of  the  cycle
of poverty. No one can argue that this is an imperative for  greater  social
stability and for a stable democratic order.

The increase in levels of poverty is not something that is  unique  to  this
country. It is a global phenomenon in all developing countries. Prof  Joseph
Stiglitz, who is a Nobel laureate in economics, argues that the excesses  of
globalisation are responsible for this phenomenon. He also  argues  that  we
need regulations to assist and protect the poor against these  excesses.  So
to come and blame this Government for the increase in the level  of  poverty
is simply dishonest.

The problem of underdevelopment can only  be  overcome  if  the  state  puts
programmes  in  place  actively   to   assist   historically   disadvantaged
individuals to break out of cycles of poverty. This  Bill  aims  to  achieve
this objective.

The most important challenge in this  process  is  that  we  must  create  a
diverse and strong economic base that includes all our people. This has  the
potential to unleash new opportunities  for  growth  and  development  which
will ultimately benefit all South  Africans.  We  must  empower  our  people
through education and training to become skilled and  financially  literate.
This is vital in the process of achieving higher levels  of  entrepreneurial
activity.

UCT's Graduate School  of  Business  2002  Global  Entrepreneurship  Monitor
reports that only 6,4% of South Africa's adult  population  is  involved  in
entrepreneurial activity, compared to 18,9% in  Thailand,  17,9%  in  India,
15,7% in Chile, 13,5% in Brazil and 12,4% in Mexico. The  study  also  found
that education  is  the  main  reason  South  Africa  ranks  poorly  against
entrepreneurial benchmarks.  The  Small  Business  Amendment  Bill  that  we
passed earlier this year, Minister,  creates  comprehensive  guidelines  for
the training and development of a cadre of  new  emerging  entrepreneurs  in
this country.

Finally, the reason we need empowerment is that we need  to  create  greater
levels of social  pluralism  in  our  society,  and  incubate  the  rise  of
multiple  social  forces  to  sustain  our  democracy.   No   democracy   is
sustainable in the long term if  the  productive  wealth  of  a  country  is
concentrated in the hands of a few.

The Government has a very important role  to  play  in  empowerment.  It  is
ultimately the champion of the empowerment process. Clause 10  of  the  Bill
provides that all Government departments and  state-owned  enterprises  must
take into account the empowerment credentials of any business competing  for
a state tender. This process is further assisted by, for the first  time,  a
comprehensive definition of what constitutes broad-based BEE.

Secondly, it must, as far as is  reasonably  possible,  apply  the  relevant
codes of good practice to ensure that those  firms  that  are  committed  to
legitimate broad-based empowerment  achieve  a  competitive  advantage  over
those that are not. The approach is simple: no one will be forced to  commit
to empowerment, but the state will use its  power  of  procurement  and  its
regulatory capacity in the economy to actively  assist  and  promote  broad-
based BEE. The entire process of BEE is guided  by  the  strategy  document,
the code of good practice and the sectoral charters.

Empowerment funding is another important area. One of the  major  challenges
we face in this  country  is  for  disadvantaged  people  first  of  all  to
identify the  right  business  opportunities,  preferably  opportunities  to
which they can add value and not simply be passive investors, and  secondly,
to obtain  sustainable  funding  for  such  transactions.  The  reason  some
empowerment transactions are failing or struggling is because they  did  not
meet these requirements for successful business transactions. They run  into
cash-flow problems and it is almost impossible to repay interest on  capital
borrowed for such transactions.

Empowerment funding has thus far been complicated  by  an  over-reliance  on
high-interest-bearing debt financing. The interest  on  empowerment  funding
offered by some state  agencies  is  unrealistically  high.  The  IDC  is  a
notable exception. If one looks at the  Isibaya  Fund,  one  is  looking  at
approximately 20% interest  on  loans  for  empowerment  transactions.  This
creates a sort of trap for many empowerment companies, because one can  give
a loan at 20% to some of the most experienced entrepreneurs in  our  society
and they will fail because this is simply  a  too  high  interest  rate  for
investment capital.

So, Minister, we must consider alternatives such  as  an  empowerment  bond.
With bond prices internationally being low at the moment, this is  certainly
something  you  need  to  explore  to  assist   historically   disadvantaged
individuals.

Another  option  is  to  build  our  equity  financing  institutions.  South
Africa's private equity and venture capital market  is  largely  undeveloped
and unexplored. The advantage here is that  the  financier's  share  in  the
risk and  the  upside  mitigate  the  risk  for  the  BEE  component.  These
financing options have the potential  to  deliver  much  cheaper  investment
capital for empowerment transactions.

I conclude. There are many challenges in the process of BEE  but  there  are
also many opportunities. I have endeavoured to highlight a few.  We  in  the
ANC support this Bill because we believe it creates the right  framework  to
nurture and build broad-based black economic empowerment.  We  believe  this
Bill  further  enables  our   Government   to   address   the   problem   of
underdevelopment amongst our people. It is a further step in our efforts  to
enable our people to push back the frontiers of poverty themselves.

Our country is founded on  the  pillars  of  human  dignity,  equality,  the
advancement of human rights and  freedom.  These  noble  objectives  of  our
democracy can only be achieved if our Government is enabled  to  assist  the
majority in our society to break out of  the  stranglehold  of  poverty  and
underdevelopment. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Deputy Speaker, the ACDP is in  agreement  that  ownership  of
the economy should reflect the demographic extent  of  our  population.  The
one distinction we hold, however, is that  we  support  a  policy  based  on
equitable empowerment which  allows  every  competent  South  African  equal
access to this country's available resources. South Africa  is  a  democracy
based on the  value  that  equality  is  the  right  of  all  its  citizens.
Therefore, equal access to equal opportunities is a national imperative.

The Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Bill  seeks  to  deracialise  the
economy by spreading economic  influence  among  all  the  people  in  South
Africa. However, even if these objectives are realised, the  problem  exists
that legislation such as the one under discussion  may  politicise  the  way
economics  is  practised  in  South  Africa  long   after   black   economic
empowerment has been achieved. There is a danger that if we place  too  much
emphasis on group preference, perpetually with no  sunset  clause,  economic
synergy representing all South Africans may suffer.

In the past we  had  white  Afrikaner  economic  empowerment.  It  was  done
sincerely to address the poor white question. The problem was  that  it  was
done at the expense of others, and  when  those  people  who  needed  to  be
empowered became empowered there was no sunset clause with  regard  to  that
kind  of  empowerment.  So  although  this  group  has   attained   economic
advancement, it did not  help  much  in  breaking  them  free  from  certain
ideological constraints.

Although this Bill has positive objectives, black economic business  per  se
must develop  its  own  independent  growth  needs.  So  although  the  ACDP
supports this Bill and the principles  of  the  Broad-Based  Black  Economic
Empowerment Bill, we wish to note our concern that black empowerment is  not
a panacea for economic growth. Economic growth is about a national  identity
equally engaging everyone involved in business. I thank you.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  the
Broad-Based  Black  Economic  Empowerment  Bill  seeks  to  create  a  legal
framework and policy clarity on a vital subject. It  is  the  lack  of  this
legal and policy  framework  that  last  year  precipitated  a  crisis  when
billions of the share value  of  mining  stocks  were  wiped  out  with  the
leaking of the draft  mining  charter.  That  incident  and  its  subsequent
resolution  has  proved  that  it  is  not  so   much   the   intention   of
transformation, as the uncertainty of how it will be  approached,  that  can
lead to suspicion and resistance on the part of  economic  stakeholders  and
investors.

As we progress towards an economy that is more inclusive and  participatory,
we must be vigilant against the abuse of this process for the  establishment
of a new elite. Such incidents do not improve the lives of the majority.  It
is therefore important  that  the  concept  ``broad-based''  should  be  the
operative theme in the pursuit of economic empowerment.

The UDM is particularly pleased with the prominent reference in the Bill  to
infrastructure as well as skills development. These two aspects are  central
concerns of the UDM, and we believe passionately that  our  future  economic
success depends on massive investments  in  these  areas  of  infrastructure
development and skills development.

It is our belief that the provisions regarding  transformation  charters  as
well as codes of good practice go a long way  towards  encouraging  economic
stakeholders to participate actively in this  vital  process.  The  specific
inclusion in clause 9(1)(c) and  (d)  of  indicators  for  measurement  will
hopefully ensure that proper monitoring of the process  is  conducted  on  a
regular basis to ensure that progress  is  encouraged,  strategies  are  re-
evaluated if positive results are lacking, and that abuse is identified  and
addressed timeously.

South Africa is potentially an  economic  powerhouse.  It  is  up  to  South
Africans from all backgrounds to embrace our collective potential  and  make
broad-based black economic empowerment  a  reality.  The  UDM  supports  the
Bill. I thank you.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Deputy Speaker and  colleagues,  the  Government  has
been at pains to improve  the  lot  of  our  people  by  passing  pieces  of
legislation such as the Labour Relations Act and the Employment Equity  Act,
and the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Bill is  another  measure  to
attempt to allow black people to taste the wealth of this country.

The Bill should however  not  be  used  as  an  instrument  to  cultivate  a
patriotic African bourgeoisie. It should assist in improving the lot of  the
diligent  disadvantaged  blacks.  Broad-based  black  economic   empowerment
should be approached with the greatest circumspection. It  is  necessary  to
keep in mind the SACP's  thesis  of  colonialism  of  a  special  type  when
saddling the black economic empowerment horse.

We in the UCDP will support the  Bill,  hoping  that  it  will,  unlike  its
precursors,  assist  in  making  headway  with  productive  investment,  job
creation, income growth, redistribution and working conditions. We  hope  it
will be broad-based in real terms.

As we deliberate on this Bill and hope to redress  economic  imbalances,  it
should not slip our minds that the fates of  black  economic  ventures  have
not been happy at all. The Business Times of 30 January  2000  reports  that
in  1997,  28  black-controlled  firms  listed  on  the  JSE  had  a  market
capitalisation worth 9,3% on the JSE total, but by the  end  of  1999  black
control of market capitalisation on the JSE had plunged to  6,8%.  Therefore
we need to be very circumspect.

We have no doubt that the guidelines laid down in the Bill will be  followed
religiously,  as  it  is  a  product  of  extensive   consultation   between
Government, the private sector and other institutions such as  the  chambers
of business. If the charters are as envisaged, and balanced  scorecards  are
used consistently by the advisory council to measure  progress  and  success
in empowerment, there may be hope that our economy  will  be  turned  around
and the lives of hardworking blacks could improve.

The UCDP supports the Bill.
Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Deputy Speaker, anyone who believes that  the  DA  will
be opposing this Bill because it wants a more robust  and  broader  approach
to BEE or that it stands for the interests of  the  majority  probably  also
believes in the tooth fairy and Father Christmas.

I have news for Mr Lowe, who I don't believe  was  sufficiently  engaged  in
the debates in the portfolio  committee.  The  Bill  before  us  today  does
promote a broad-based approach to black economic empowerment. It is  not  so
broad that it covers every programme to combat poverty  and  inequality,  or
so broad that it  attempts  to  reduce  all  other  interventions  to  black
economic empowerment, but it certainly does aim to  unleash  processes  that
will be of benefit to large numbers of black  people  across  society  as  a
whole.

Thus, while changing the racially skewed pattern of  ownership  of  existing
formal sector firms and enterprises, in effect,  combating  the  effects  of
long  entrenched  job  reservation  for  the  bourgeoisie  does  remain   an
important objective. The policy on which this Bill is based  also  seeks  to
promote structural change in the economy, which will broaden access  to  the
powers of economic ownership  for  large  numbers  of  black  people  across
society.

The  Bill's  first   objective   thus   speaks   of   ``promoting   economic
transformation in order to enable meaningful participation of  black  people
in the economy''. Other objectives  speak  of  ``increasing  the  extent  to
which communities, workers, co-operatives and other  collective  enterprises
own and manage existing and new enterprises, and increasing their access  to
economic activities, infrastructure and skills training''.

It has been increasingly widely recognised that broad-based  black  economic
empowerment of this type is not only a political  and  social  but  also  an
economic imperative. The Growth and Development Summit  which  was  held  in
June this year saw Government and social partners agreeing on  the  need  to
act  together  on  programmes  to  combat   the   trend   towards   economic
marginalisation of many of our people, trends which  have  their  origin  in
the 1970s and in processes outside the political economy of South Africa.

The social partners agreed at the Growth and  Development  Summit  that  the
absolute economic priority at the present phase of  our  development  is  to
enlarge income-earning opportunities for  many  thousands  of  black  people
suffering the effects of structural unemployment. A key feature of  informed
debate and thinking on this matter is a recognition that this will not  come
about through the expanded reproduction  of  the  existing  and  established
formal sector and the creation of wage  labour  employment  in  that  sector
alone. Rather, efforts to boost  job  creation  and  job  retention  in  the
formal economy need to be complemented by  structural  change  which  boosts
access  to  high-quality  income-earning   opportunities   for   people   in
alternative economic activities and which addresses the complex  reality  of
asset, skill and  income  poverty,  as  well  as  reducing  high  levels  of
inequality facing our country.

This indeed is increasingly widely seen  as  critical  to  boosting  growth,
which in the context of our reality cannot  be  separated  from  efforts  to
promote development. A notable feature of the Growth and Development  Summit
therefore was that the social partners endorsed broad-based  black  economic
empowerment as one of  the  critical  components  of  a  strategy  to  boost
developmental growth. One of  the  recommendations  in  the  report  of  the
portfolio committee which was published in  yesterday's  ATCs  is  that  the
revised version of the strategy document on which this Bill is based  should
adopt the definition of broad-based black  economic  empowerment  agreed  at
the Growth and Development Summit.

The Bill and the strategy document on which it is based are the  product  of
long debates and discussion. They build on important work undertaken by  the
Black Economic Empowerment Commission, chaired by Comrade  Cyril  Ramaphosa,
and on sections on BEE in the Resolution on Economic Transformation  adopted
at  the  ANC's  51st  Congress  in  Stellenbosch.  The   strategy   document
acknowledges that earlier efforts to promote BEE were both  too  narrow  and
too  fragile.  The  strategy  document   identifies   specific   points   of
intervention to shape a broader and more durable process.

As previous speakers  have  indicated,  the  strategy  document  presents  a
framework to measure a sector's or form's  contribution  to  BEE,  something
that was previously extremely subjective and elusive. It also  offers  clear
definitions of black enterprise, black-empowered  enterprise,  black  woman-
owned enterprise, and community  or  broad-based  enterprise,  which  should
assist in combating the practice of  fronting,  which  the  Deputy  Minister
referred to earlier.

The strategy document then indicates that Government  and  public  entities,
in decisions on awarding tenders, contracts  or  regulatory  benefits,  will
use a balanced scorecard measuring the  contribution  to  BEE  according  to
measurable  criteria  in  the  realm  of  ownership,   access   to   skilled
occupations, and so-called indirect empowerment,  which  includes  contracts
and tendering but also contributions to infrastructure development  and,  Mr
Lowe, to job creation - ie that all these are taken  into  account  in  such
decisions.

The Bill creates a legal basis to  give  effect  to  this  by  allowing  the
Minister to promulgate codes  of  good  practice  and  to  publish  sectoral
charters that the Minister is satisfied promote the objects of the Bill  and
have been arrived at by inclusive processes in  the  sector  concerned.  The
Bill places specific obligations on  public  entities  in  this  regard  and
also, as previous speakers  have  said,  establishes  an  advisory  council,
chaired by the President but including members, representatives of  relevant
constituencies, chosen through an appropriate consultative process.

One of the main changes made at the committee  stage  was  to  significantly
strengthen the provisions related to the  obligations  of  public  entities.
All organs of state and public entities are required to ``take into  account
and, as far as is reasonably possible,  apply  any  relevant  code  of  good
practice'' in regulatory decisions and in their own  transactions.  This  in
my opinion  considerably  advances  the  view  of  the  role  of  state  and
enterprises in promoting BEE over the initial drafts of the Bill.  The  Bill
makes it clear that public entities  have  broad  responsibilities  in  this
regard in the daily conduct of their operations, and further points will  be
elaborated in the shareholder compacts.

The Bill and strategy document will provide a framework.  The  details  will
emerge in the processes  that  will  follow,  namely  in  the  processes  of
developing sectoral charters and in compiling  and  assessing  the  balanced
scorecards. It is in and through the details  of  these  processes  that  we
will be able to measure and assess progress in  promoting  broad-based  BEE.
The advisory council will have a critical role to play in this  regard,  but
one would expect and hope that all other  monitoring  activities,  including
those undertaken by this Parliament, will begin to request  reports  on  BEE
performance as measured in balanced scorecards,  as  well  as  interrogating
the basis on which these measurements are constructed.
As I indicated earlier, it is now widely agreed in this country that  broad-
based BEE is an economic as well as a social imperative. I  hope  and  trust
that we will see this sentiment being translated into positive  co-operation
to push this process forward.

The ANC will of course be supporting this Bill. [Interjections.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Deputy Speaker, this Bill  has  good  intentions.  The
PAC supports it. The only problem is that the  expression  ``black  economic
empowerment'' is now becoming meaningless.

The purpose  of  the  Bill  is,  inter  alia,  to  establish  a  legislative
framework for the promotion of black economic empowerment. In  its  preamble
the Bill states, among other things, that under apartheid race was  used  to
control access  to  South  Africa's  productive  resources,  and  access  to
skills. This is correct.

But, can there be promotion of black economic empowerment when  the  African
people, who were never put in possession  of  resources  such  as  land  and
mineral wealth, are without capital to advance economically?  Can  there  be
promotion of black economic empowerment when the children  of  the  poor  in
this country cannot receive education because they cannot afford the  school
fees? Education determines the place of our children in  this  society,  and
in the world, when they become adults.

Statistics show that  the  African  people,  whom  we  call  black  in  this
country, are the most unemployed. Only 50% of African workers are  employed.
This shows that they are unskilled and therefore cannot compete  with  those
who have money to pay their school fees and acquire  university  and  higher
education.

Over 10 million Africans live in squatter camps not fit  for  human  beings.
Yet, there is a property clause in the Constitution  of  our  country  which
has legalised their land dispossession by confining  land  claims  to  after
June 1913, when the consequences of the Native Land Act  of  1913  are  well
known to have been the main cause of the poverty the African  people  suffer
today.

African businesspeople have become bankrupt  in  great  numbers.  They  need
assistance if this Bill is to have any meaning. African  farmers  throughout
the country have to be subsidised and given training  to  become  successful
farmers. Too many of  them  owe  banks  millions  of  rands.  They  are  not
protected.

Last week I saw the misery of some of these farmers in  Mafikeng.  It  is  a
disgrace that the vast African majority of this country controls only 2%  of
our country's economy, while this economy was  built  with  their  so-called
cheap native labour. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy  Speaker.  South  Africa's  economy
cannot operate to its full potential because  the  vast  majority  is  still
earning a very low income, and is excluded from ownership of  fixed  assets.
The MF feels that advanced skills are also urgently needed for the  majority
of South Africans to participate in the economy of South Africa.

The Broad-Based Black  Economic  Empowerment  Bill  seeks  to  extend  black
participation in the economy in terms of ownership,  management  and  skills
development, also to  reduce  income  inequalities  and  poverty,  which  is
wholeheartedly supported by the MF.

The proposal in this Bill to promote changes and economic transformation  of
the  racial  composition  of  ownership,  and  to  increase  management   by
communities, workers and co-operatives, are steps in  the  right  direction,
as are empowering rural and local communities which  were  totally  excluded
in the past by the apartheid regime.

This Bill makes provision for levelling the playing  field.  Therefore,  the
MF supports the Broad-Based Black  Economic  Empowerment  Bill.  Thank  you,
Madam Deputy Speaker.

Mr C AUCAMP:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  NA  is  in  favour  of  economic
empowerment, not of a few, but of all in South Africa. We  also  accept  the
reality that the focus inevitably will fall on black  economic  empowerment,
as objective statistics prove that this is the area where disempowerment  is
at its highest. This is, however, a very delicate issue, as  was  proved  by
the adverse consequences when the preliminary document on black  empowerment
in the mining sector was leaked to the press.

Die NA glo dat ekonomiese bemagtiging oor die volle spektrum  moet  geskied.
Ons glo in die ou gesegde: as die watervlak in die hawe styg,  dan  lig  dit
al die skepe op. Daarom moet selfs swart ekonomiese bemagtiging in  hoofsaak
fokus op ekonomiese  groei,  op  die  uitskakeling  van  beleidsrigtings  en
praktyke wat ekonomiese groei  belemmer,  en  op  die  verkleining  van  die
ontsaglike kloof tussen ryk en arm oor alle gemeenskappe heen. Ons  merk  té
min daarvan in hierdie wetsontwerp. Die fokus val steeds nie op  bemagtiging
nie, maar op bevoorregting.  In  die  proses  word  bloot  nuwe  ongelykhede
geskep.
Dit is verstaanbaar dat hierdie wetsontwerp slegs breë riglyne  wil  neerlê.
In die proses is dit egter só breed  dat  die  Minister  se  bevoegdhede  so
breed word dat hy met 'n bokwa daarin kan draai. Volgens klousule 9 mag  die
Minister self definisies en  vertolkings,  kwalifikasiekriteria  en  riglyne
bepaal. Juis die vaagheid en die breë basis van dié wetgewing gee  in  effek
carte blanche aan die Minister.

Hierdie wetgewing fokus hoegenaamd nie op die sleutelvraag van  werkskepping
nie, ook nie op die kritieke vraag van vaardigheidsontwikkeling nie.  Verder
is daar geen vereiste vir die ononderhandelbaarheid van  standaarde  en  die
plek van meriete nie.

Met dié wetgewing het ons die bal laat val om 'n beleid  daar  te  stel  wat
bemagtiging met  groei  kon  versoen  en  vertroue  in  die  Suid-Afrikaanse
ekonomie kon verhoog. Die NA kan nie dié wetgewing ondersteun nie.  Ek  dank
u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The NA believes that economic empowerment should take place over  the  full
spectrum. We believe in the old saying: if the water level  in  the  harbour
rises, it lifts all the ships. That is why even black  economic  empowerment
should focus mainly  on  economic  growth,  on  the  elimination  of  policy
directions and practices which hamper economic growth, and on the  reduction
of the giant gulf between rich and poor in  all  communities.  We  note  too
little of that in this Bill. The focus is still not on empowerment,  but  on
privilege. In the process new inequalities are merely being created.

It  is  understandable  that  this  Bill  only  seeks  to  lay  down   broad
guidelines. In the process it is, however,  so  broad  that  the  Minister's
powers become so  broad  that  he  can  turn  in  them  with  a  buck-wagon.
According to clause 9  the  Minister  may  himself  decide  on  definitions,
interpretations, qualification criteria and guidelines. The  very  vagueness
and the broad base of this legislation in effect give carte blanche  to  the
Minister.

This legislation does not  in  any  way  focus  on  the  key  issue  of  job
creation, or on the critical issue of skills  development.  Moreover,  there
is no requirement for the non-negotiability of standards and  the  place  of
merit.

With this legislation we have missed the chance to introduce a policy  which
could reconcile empowerment with growth and which could increase  confidence
in the South African economy. The NA  cannot  support  this  legislation.  I
thank you.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you, Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  Apartheid  is  apparently
alive and well and thriving in South Africa, if this Bill and its title  are
anything to go by.

If this Bill, geared to empower black South Africans - unfortunately at  the
expense of white South Africans - were,  in  practice,  to  set  up  wealth-
generating opportunities for the masses, there might  be  some  benefit  for
our economy as a whole. Instead, the vast disparity between rich  and  poor,
among whom a growing number are poor white  South  Africans,  is  the  harsh
reality.

In effect, BEE has resulted in widespread enrichment  of  politically  well-
connected fat cats, invariably thrust into  positions  of  influence,  often
ill equipped to  handle  the  huge  responsibilities  associated  with  high
office, resulting in the situation in which we now find  ourselves,  with  a
select few filthy rich individuals amid a sea of grinding poverty.

This is really not the way to true economic empowerment. BEE is  essentially
no  different  from  the  pernicious  and  racist  job  reservation  of  the
apartheid government. It is naked racism, discrimination in reverse,  except
in the case of the old  job  reservation  it  was  an  arguably  sustainable
version, empowering a small minority of South Africans, whereas  BEE  is  an
engineered empowerment of a huge majority, which is patently unsustainable.

What  South  Africa  requires  for  true  economic  empowerment   for   all,
irrespective of race, is the creation of a vibrant  economy,  dependent  not
on one's political allegiances, but on the hard work  and  industry  of  the
broad mass of ordinary or, should I say, extraordinary South  Africans.  And
all Government needs to do is  interfere  as  little  as  possible,  instead
playing a  facilitating  and  enabling  role,  removing  obstacles  such  as
restrictive labour legislation and excessive taxation, and  reserving  tough
laws to combat violent crime, which  is  a  growing  threat  to  the  future
economic sustainability of our country.

I thank you Deputy Speaker. I do not support the Bill.

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Thank  you,  Deputy  Speaker.  Hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy
Minister, hon members and comrades, indeed, as we  are  about  to  celebrate
our coming  decade  of  freedom  in  this  country,  the  Broad-Based  Black
Economic Empowerment Bill in front of us here today fulfils that  commitment
and the mandate our people gave us in 1955 when the Freedom Charter was  put
together by our people.

The Freedom Charter said to us that South Africa belongs to all who live  in
it and indeed that the wealth of the country shall  be  shared  amongst  all
those who work in it. It is ironic to hear the  IAM  talking  about  reverse
racism when we  have  a  Constitution  in  this  country  that  argues  that
equality is important  and  that  all  South  Africans  should  enjoy  equal
participation, not in certain things, but in particular in  the  economy  of
South Africa. We should maybe ask them to read  the  Constitution  of  South
Africa so that they can become familiar with  the  fact  that  this  country
belongs to all now, and not just to a few.

The 1994 democratic breakthrough by the ANC has opened up possibilities  for
the transformation of the South  African  economy,  and  for  a  society  in
pursuit of the historical objectives of the  social  emancipation  of  black
people and women in particular. There can therefore be no  contradiction  of
the urgency to raise the growth levels  of  the  economy  and  the  need  to
redistribute the skewed wealth and  ownership  patterns  we  still  have  in
South Africa today. These  are  mutually  reinforcing  imperatives,  neither
sustainable without the other.

The commitment given to this country at the Growth  and  Development  Summit
in June this year by Government, business and labour  and  the  communities,
not only identified the key challenges  to  broad-based  black  empowerment,
but most importantly, the  agreement  laid  the  basis  for  us  in  a  very
organised way to contribute to this realisation of  ending  the  dualism  in
this economy.

Today, as we pass this Bill, we mandate our Government to use the  necessary
tools at their disposal, such as procurement, licensing  and  tendering,  to
stimulate the creation of jobs  and  to  promote  small  enterprises.  Those
tools, we trust, Madam Deputy Speaker,  will  also  be  used  by  Parliament
itself and not only by the Government institutions.

The challenge ahead of us is to build what  I  would  argue  is  a  people's
economy. A people's economy places the eradication of poverty at the  centre
of economic restructuring and replaces the myth of ever-increasing  fronting
that most of our black people were led to  believe  was  necessary  to  gain
entry into the economy. Julius Nyerere was correct when he  said  we  should
not give people fish only, we must give people the rods also  in  order  for
them to catch the fish.

In the August edition of ANC Today the President articulated  these  issues.
I could hear many today trying to articulate and  interpret  some  of  these
issues, but of  course  they  are  not  in  the  ANC  and  they  will  never
understand our language. The President correctly argues in ANC Today  -  and
one wholeheartedly supports these views - that  sometimes  higher  rates  of
economic growth, of 6% and above, will not on  their  own,  hon  Mark  Lowe,
lead to a reduction in the levels of unemployment. On its own it will  never
reduce unemployment in South Africa.

This argument that I have put forward is a proposition  about  an  automatic
so-called trickle-down effect that  would  allegedly  impact  on  the  Third
World economy, rather than on the First World  economy.  The  task,  rather,
that faces us is to devise and implement a strategy  to  intervene  in  this
Third World economy that is still in South Africa and  to  make  a  people's
economy a reality.

For this we require the transfer of resources, so that such  transfer  could
empower working people and the unemployed, and we should  combine  the  many
decisions and programmes adopted by Government already in a sustainable  way
so that we can transform. There are many programmes  already,  such  as  the
skills development programme, our education  programme,  the  transformation
of the financial sector that is already taking place, our programmes  around
infrastructure in the country, and the provisions we  have  introduced  with
regard to basic water and electricity. By combining these, we will  be  able
to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty,  but  we  will  also  be  able  to
transform this economy so that we  are  able  to  end  underdevelopment  and
marginalisation.

As the ANC we pride ourselves on a long tradition of community  co-operation
and collectivism. Many of our members in our townships and rural areas  will
enhance these  local  initiatives  with  local  ownership  and  will  indeed
empower our communities to contribute to broader community  development  and
broad-based black empowerment for all, and not for a select few.

Of course this Bill on its own is not going to assist and  I  want  to  take
this opportunity to address many of our people out there  and  black  people
in particular. It is going to be important, if you want  to  participate  in
the economy and to benefit from this Bill, to make sure that  you  get  your
identity document now. Get your ID  so  that  you  can  participate  in  the
economy. And make sure that you get your ID so that  you  register  to  vote
and, of course, make sure that you vote for the ANC. [Interjections.]

I want to thank the department for helping the committee, as we  worked  for
many, many hours and days to draft a Bill which in our  view,  hon  Minister
and the department, will be a product that will assist our people.  We  want
to thank the Deputy Minister, the deputy director-general, my former  mentor
Lionel October, and the legal department for assisting  us  with  this  very
crucial process of bringing a product to  you  today  which  we  trust  will
work.

In conclusion, the global economy today is still characterised  by  division
into two worlds, which many are denying. Indeed we are sitting with a  First
World and a Third World; one in the North, one in the  South;  one  that  is
rich and developed and one that is poor  and  underdeveloped.  As  correctly
stated by our  President,  South  Africa  contains  this  global  phenomenon
within its borders and therefore the resultant co-existence of  two  nations
side by side. We have it  in  our  power  to  use  this  Bill  to  end  this
division. This we will achieve through a  protected  process  of  engagement
with the poor, in a people's contract to push back the frontiers of  poverty
and eradicate underdevelopment. I thank you for your attention. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson and colleagues, I  think  we
had this afternoon, at the beginning of these deliberations, a very  graphic
illustration of some of the political  schizophrenia  that  will  mean  that
certain parties in this country become increasingly irrelevant. I think  the
problem for a certain party - I don't have to name it -  is  that  they  are
very scared of anything done by this Government that will  actually  benefit
the majority, because they think that that  will  strengthen  the  ANC,  and
they know that that will be a problem for them. So  they  end  up  attacking
things which every other sensible person in this House  takes  as  a  fairly
normal proposition, that we  have  to  do  something  about  black  economic
empowerment.

We got a long attack. The  words  stated  here  were,  ``I  as  a  youngster
remember arguing and fighting against equal opportunity and  merit.  It  did
nothing then for the majority and it's going  to  do  nothing  now  for  the
majority.'' This is merely an attempt to excuse the status quo. This is  why
this particular party sitting here cannot and will not make  a  contribution
to change in this country.

What is interesting to me is that all other substantial  parties,  with  the
exception of ``I Am Crazy'' and ``NA'',  support  this.  We  all  know  it's
complicated. We all know there may be  certain  reservations.  But  I  think
everyone here has made it quite clear that they support the Bill.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister,  there  is  a  point  of
order. Can you take your seat please?

Mr D H M GIBSON: Mr Chairperson, on a  point  of  order:  The  hon  Minister
referred to a particular hon member of the House and said  ``I  Am  Crazy''.
Since that party is called the IAM, it's quite clearly a reference  to  that
party. I think it's inappropriate and unparliamentary.  Would  you  instruct
the hon Minister to withdraw that statement?
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: It's my understanding that the  Minister  did
not name any particular member of a party. Therefore,  I  don't  think  it's
unparliamentary, because it refers to a political party, not  an  individual
member. Please continue, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you very  much,  Chair.  I  concur
with your ruling.

I would like to make one or two points regarding matters that  were  raised.
Regarding the question of ministerial discretion, I really  would  urge  the
colleagues who raised it, hon Ngiba from the IFP and Cassie Aucamp from  the
NA, to look at what the Bill says. We are really trying to take a  situation
where, after consultation, we need some way of taking that  and  putting  it
in  the  public  domain.  That  is  what  we  are  doing  here.   There   is
consultation. The Minister would then put codes of good practice out, as  we
do under Nedlac in the labour arena. So we are not looking at all  sorts  of
issues coming out every five minutes.  There's  a  consultation  period.  We
have lengthened that consultation period. Inputs can be  made  and  we  will
have an advisory council as well to oversee this process.

Colleagues, I think it will be important for us to look at the process  from
here. I am taking it that this House will pass this Bill. The task team  has
been very valuable to me and the department and I have asked  that  we  meet
again in October. From the report made by the portfolio committee  and  from
our own experience and exposure to many of the events in recent  months,  it
is very clear that in the strategy document we need to spell  out  a  number
of other areas to bring about clarity in those areas. We therefore  need  to
make certain amendments to those. We are hoping, as well,  to  benefit  from
the experience of the financial charter process, which has  set  itself  the
target of coming forward with the  first  drafts  of  that  by  the  end  of
September.

This will allow us then to prepare for the institutional structure, for  the
advisory council. Once the President has put in place the  Act,  brought  it
into law, we appoint the advisory council.  As  I  have  indicated,  we  are
working through the IDC and the NEF, to deal with some  of  the  matters  of
finance that were raised by the hon Lockey, and  in  the  meantime  the  NEF
will continue with the existing programmes it has on venture capital.

Colleagues, my impression is, and I think it is confirmed by the task  team,
that the market is responding. The private sector  is  responding.  Contrary
to some of the nonsense we heard spoken about, there's  a  great  commitment
and goodwill amongst all peoples of South Africa to make sure that this  BEE
does work and does transform the economy. I think it's  in  our  hands.  The
member is right, laws can't do it. It's in our hands to be  committed  to  a
new South Africa where everyone has an equitable and fair chance to be  part
of this economy, and I think the majority of this House are truly  committed
to that; the exceptions are sad. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

                                 LIQUOR BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank  you  very  much,  Chairperson.  I
think it's about time that Ministers had  shop  stewards.  It's  becoming  a
tough day. Connie, maybe you can help me. [Laughter.]

Madam Speaker and hon members, ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Sorry, hon Minister, please continue.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: I was just  checking  that  I  got  full
time, Chairperson. They were trying to take some away from the Liquor Bill.

Chairperson and hon members, the Liquor Bill that has been tabled today  has
been long in the making, and is in a sense a building block in  the  concept
of co-operative  governance  set  out  in  the  Constitution.  There  is  no
question that we needed a new regulatory dispensation in this industry.  The
issue was the arrangement of powers and responsibilities between  the  three
spheres of government. The wait has been long, and  the  consultations  with
the provinces, various components of the industry  and  social  groups  have
been intense, and sometimes circuitous. However,  the  final  product  is  a
better piece of legislation for all.

As you will recall, the Liquor Bill was previously introduced in and  passed
by Parliament in 1998.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  Minister,  will  you  give  me  a
second? Order, hon members! Please be seated.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chairperson.  I  think  maybe
we should have a new section in this Liquor Bill which  says  that  the  bar
will be closed when the Minister of Trade and Industry speaks. [Laughter.]

That  Bill  introduced  the  concept  of  registration   of   manufacturers,
micromanufacturers, distributors and retailers or, in common  parlance,  the
three-tier system. This meant the  Bill  also  impacted  on  the  powers  of
provinces and local  government,  which  raised  issues  of  concurrent  and
exclusive powers and the matter of co-operative governance.

To  obtain  clarity,  the  Bill  was  referred  by  the  President  to   the
Constitutional Court before its promulgation. That court found the  Bill  to
be unconstitutional in some respects,  in  particular  with  regard  to  the
jurisdictions of national and provincial governments,  and  ruled  that  the
retail  and   micromanufacture   of   liquor   were   exclusive   provincial
jurisdictions.

After the Constitutional Court judgment was  handed  down,  the  process  of
redrafting  the  Liquor  Bill  was  initiated,  which  culminated   in   the
introduction of this new Liquor Bill in Parliament in May of this  year.  As
I have  indicated,  this  was  an  exhaustive  process  that  involved  many
stakeholders in one or other form. The Bill does  propose  a  new  and  more
comprehensive  regulatory  structure  for  the  industry,  and  it  was  not
surprising that at public hearings on the Liquor Bill, a number of  concerns
about the Bill were again raised relating to the proposed implementation  of
a flexible three-tier system, the constitutionality of  certain  aspects  of
the Bill, and other technical issues.

The  introduction  of  a  flexible  three-tier  system  understandably   has
proponents and detractors. Within the industry, this was  an  area  of  much
attention, and we once again canvassed many of  the  issues  dealt  with  in
1998. For Government, the intention was to  regulate  and  largely  separate
the three tiers, within  the  industry,  of  manufacture,  distribution  and
retail.

However, we have always been cognisant of the need for flexibility  in  this
regard so as to meet different economic realities and needs.  We  have  been
pragmatic and  not  dogmatic  on  the  matter,  provided  we  know  what  is
happening, and that we do effect a degree  of  economic  separation  of  the
three tiers.
The issues are many and complex. We welcome  the  fact  that  the  Portfolio
Committee on Trade and  Industry  granted  the  DTI  time  to  consider  the
technical matters that were raised, and consult with the liquor industry.  I
believe the time  has  been  well-spent,  and  the  Liquor  Bill  I  am  now
introducing  reflects  broad  agreement   with   the   industry,   addresses
constitutional  and  technical  matters   that   were   raised   and   meets
Government's original intentions in a workable manner.

I will not repeat what I said in 1998 about the very  special  and  somewhat
pernicious history of the liquor industry in South Africa. However, we  must
not forget the reality that  the  history  of  liquor  regulation  in  South
Africa was an integral part  of  segregation.  Legislation  prevented  black
persons from legally entering the economic dimensions of the  industry,  and
thus visited major social consequences on those persons. Liquor was used  in
the notorious ``dop system'' as a means  of  payment,  again  with  profound
social  consequences.  The  result  was  a  dualism  of   massive   economic
concentration in size on the  one  hand,  and  an  equally  massive  illegal
industry that was very socially vulnerable on the other.

This was a sad and bad situation that we are bound to redress as far  as  is
economically feasible in the present time. The work on  this  redress  began
in 1997 with the publication of the Liquor Policy. The stated objectives  of
that policy  were  to  restructure  the  liquor  industry  and  address  the
socioeconomic costs of alcohol abuse. This Bill  seeks  to  give  effect  to
these objectives, and to the principles of co-operative governance, and  the
requirements   of   the   Constitution   in   terms   of   the    respective
responsibilities of national and provincial government and local  government
in the regulation of the liquor industry.

In addressing the socioeconomic costs of alcohol abuse, the  Bill  seeks  to
address these in a particular manner as set out in Chapter  2:  restrictions
on the supply of liquor to minors; certain restrictions on  the  advertising
of liquor, particularly advertising targeting minors; the use of  liquor  as
an inducement  for  employment,  thus  outlawing  the  ``dop  system'';  the
manufacture and  supply  of  methylated  spirits,  and  the  prohibition  of
concoctions. In addition, in Chapter 3, the Bill requires manufacturers  and
distributors to submit a plan to combat the abuse  of  alcohol  as  part  of
their registration requirements.

In the restructuring of the industry, the Bill proposes the introduction  of
a flexible  three-tier  system  which  requires  separate  registration  and
regulation of the manufacture and distribution of  liquor  through  national
Government, and the registration and regulation  of  micromanufacturers  and
the retail sale of liquor through provincial government.

The Bill requires the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  to  evaluate  the
registration in terms of three main criteria: the  commitment  to  BEE,  the
commitment to combating the abuse of alcohol and the impact of  registration
on new entry into the industry, diversity of ownership  and  competition  in
the industry balanced against  the  impact  of  employment,  efficiency  and
exports.
Based on the evaluation of the criteria, the Minister may impose  conditions
on the registration. However, the Bill allows the  Minister  to  review  the
conditions of registration if the registrant  registers  as  a  retailer  or
micromanufacturer in provincial legislation,  contravenes  certain  laws  or
fails to meet the conditions of its registration. Chapters 4 and  5  provide
for inspection powers, offences and penalties.

I think that, in an important development, the Bill gives expression to  co-
operative governance by creating the National  Liquor  Policy  Council.  The
council  is  an  intergovernmental  forum  headed  by   the   Minister   and
constituted by the member of the executive council  responsible  for  liquor
licensing in each province. The council's functions are to develop  national
norms and standards for the liquor  industry,  develop  national  policy  in
respect of the liquor industry, and promote intergovernmental relations.

We have taken account of the need for a transitional mechanism  between  the
existing situation and the new Act. I believe that this  Liquor  Bill  gives
expression to  the  objectives  of  our  1997  Liquor  Policy  by  providing
mechanisms to intervene in the structure of the  industry  where  necessary,
to create conditions facilitating new entry and black economic  empowerment,
and to combat  the  socioeconomic  consequences  of  alcohol  abuse  through
certain public interest prohibitions and the development of  a  sustainable,
responsible liquor industry.

Yet again, let me express my thanks to the  portfolio  committee  which  has
helped us to steer this very difficult  piece  of  legislation  up  to  this
point. Thanks go to my provincial colleagues and  their  officials  for  all
their hard work. Thanks go to the DTI team for their hard  work,  with  more
to come as we set up the institutional capacity to implement the new Act.  I
shall also say a special word of thanks to  many  in  the  industry  and  to
various groups that went out of their way to  ensure  that  we  address  the
economic need and reality whilst ensuring social responsibility.

I commend this Bill to the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Thank you, Chairman. The Bill claims to have both a social  and
a  commercial  objective:  Its  social  aim  is  to   reduce   the   massive
socioeconomic cost of South  Africa's  widespread  alcohol  abuse,  and  its
commercial aim is to develop a responsible and sustainable  liquor  industry
that welcomes new participants, diversity  of  ownership  and  an  ethos  of
social responsibility.

This second objective  is  essentially  for  the  industry  to  restructure,
empower  and  transform.  But,  unlike  the  social  aim,  exactly  how  the
commercial one will be met is far from clear.

The need to combat and reduce the socioeconomic and other costs  of  alcohol
abuse in South Africa is  an  important  one  that  stems  from  decades  of
shameful apartheid legislation, including the current 1989 Liquor  Act,  and
stretching back to Lord Milner's Liquor Proclamation over a century ago.

Previous liquor policies were overly interventionist; they were  racist  and
patronising, intended to at  first  prevent  and  then  minimise  access  to
liquor by black South Africans as both consumers  and  entrepreneurs.  After
1960, in a failed effort to control the burgeoning  illegal  liquor  outlets
in locations and townships, the apartheid regime allowed blacks  to  consume
liquor, provided it was purchased from  government-owned  outlets  in  these
designated areas, or from a special window in white-owned liquor stores.

The abuse of liquor as a means of payment to workers, as  the  Minister  has
commented, particularly in the wine industry,  is  equally  well-documented,
with a sad and destructive effect still seen very  evidently  every  weekend
across this province and across this country.

The department justifies the imposition of  a  regulated  framework  on  the
liquor industry on the grounds that it will prevent alcohol abuse.  We  wish
it were so, but the ease  with  which  alcohol  can  be  obtained  in  South
Africa, despite already heavy restrictions,  suggests  this  argument  holds
little water.

The key to the previous regime's racist liquor policy was  strict  licensing
and regulation, and we concur with the Free  Market  Foundation  that  in  a
nonracial and democratic South Africa, it  is  profoundly  inappropriate  to
perpetuate this legacy. If we claim to be a free society with  a  government
that treats its citizens like responsible  adults,  capable  of  voting  and
enjoying the rewards, risks and responsibilities of freedom, then we  should
reflect that in our liquor policy.

The DA believes that restrictions on the sale  or  distribution  of  alcohol
must only be targeted at the real problem: abuse of  alcohol.  The  sale  of
alcohol to  underage  children  or  obviously  intoxicated  adults  must  be
strictly prohibited and  strongly  policed,  preferably  by  provincial  and
municipal authorities  which  are  best  placed  to  ensure  success.  Other
restrictions on public health grounds may often be justified, but they  must
be clearly  defined,  not  open  to  ministerial  discretion,  and  must  be
governed by the Departments of Health and of Social Welfare, rather than  by
Trade and Industry.

Otherwise, market forces  should  govern  the  organisation  of  the  liquor
industry, as with virtually all other consumer goods,  subject  to  existing
anticompetitive behaviour and quality control  legislation.  Ultimately,  it
should be for provinces to decide how best to structure and  regulate  their
liquor industries.

Despite the Bill recognising the  Constitutional  Court  ruling  making  the
licensing  of  retailers,  including  the  elusive   shebeens   and   tavern
operators, a  provincial  function,  we  believe  that  it  still  tries  to
regulate in areas of provincial competence, and to  prescribe  to  provinces
what they must do when it is unnecessary  to  do  so.  Our  Constitution  is
unambiguous about liquor licensing being an exclusive provincial  competence
and Government should respect this clear intent and not try to prescribe  or
impose its wishes on provincial governments.
The  Bill  grants  the  Minister  discretionary  powers   of   intervention,
regulation, review and appeal, but discriminates in  the  concurring  powers
allocated to provincial MECs by requiring them to  control  the  issuing  of
retail licences through a regulatory mechanism of a board under  the  Public
Finance  Management  Act.  If  the  Minister  can  take  decisions   without
reference to a board or a council, then why can the MEC not do the  same  at
provincial level?

The DA is also concerned  that  the  National  Liquor  Policy  Council  will
become a body intended to enforce central Government's views  on  individual
provinces, thereby violating their provincial competencies.

Again, we agree with  the  Free  Market  Foundation's  view  that  provinces
should have the constitutional right to determine their  own  liquor  policy
with the  sole  proviso  that  it  is  not  in  conflict  with  the  general
provisions about the sale of liquor to minors, sale during  confined  hours,
sale to intoxicated people and nuisance law.

Turning to the commercial objectives of the Bill, more  than  80%  of  South
Africa's beer consumption takes place in the townships  where  most  of  the
country's 200 000 shebeens - more than 90% of all retail  liquor  outlets  -
are found. Here is an ideal opportunity to reverse the  racial  restrictions
of the past and bring township entrepreneurs  into  the  mainstream  of  the
liquor industry through genuine and widespread black economic empowerment.

And so, in its original form, the Bill sought to legislate  a  restructuring
programme started by Government in 1995 with  the  Liquor  Forum,  a  broad-
based consultative process. It disentangled the marketing  and  distribution
arms of liquor by creating an  independently  owned  distribution  mechanism
free of producer control, thereby separating ownership of the  supply  chain
to ensure that it was not further entrenched  in  the  existing  monopolies.
Thus, wholesalers could choose from where to source their product,  breaking
the noose of tied-pricing arrangements.

The Bill gave the manufacturers who  owned  the  distribution  system  three
years to disinvest and was generally welcomed by thousands of small,  mostly
black,  retailers  who  recognised  the  opportunities  it   offered   them.
Understandably, it was condemned by the major industry players and,  despite
nearly eight years  in  the  formulation,  was  suddenly  withdrawn  by  the
department in  late  May,  ostensibly  for  further  consultation  with  the
industry.

At the time, the DTI claimed that the reason was mainly  to  reconsider  the
social responsibility and constitutional issues of the Bill,  and  that  the
three-tier system which premised the entire industry  restructure  was  non-
negotiable. Well, so much for that. One commentator subsequently noted  that
they might as well have just said, ``Read my lips''.

The amending Bill has been called a pale copy of its apartheid  predecessor.
Significantly, it accommodates the industry  monopolies  by  allowing  cross
holdings in the manufacturing and distribution sectors. Their ability  as  a
monopoly to control the trade  rests  on  their  control  at  the  wholesale
distribution level, and this effectively keeps the industry in the same  few
hands, leaving any restructuring of it entirely at their and the  Minister's
discretion - totally contradictory to Government's BEE strategy.

Some commentators have  seriously  wondered  if  the  Minister  hasn't  been
bought by an industry still  buried  in  apartheid  legislation,  whose  key
players are now able  to  perpetuate  the  status  quo  inherited  and  keep
empowerment and transformation at bay, or at least  on  their  terms,  until
such time as their overseas operations and markets substantially reduce  the
significance  of  the  South  African  one.  Because  the   Bill   regulates
manufacturing  and  distribution,  it  stymies  any  chance  of   provincial
legislatures creating new empowerment opportunities for their retail trade.

Irrespective  of  any  operating  efficiencies  currently  in   distribution
networks and channels, the point is that the Bill entrenches control of  the
manufacturing and distribution  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  the  retailing
sectors. It squanders a unique opportunity for  black  economic  empowerment
and to further the interests, such as they are, of thousands of small  black
businesses who remain shut out. It misses an enormous opportunity to  create
new jobs and force illegal shebeen owners to get licenses and  start  paying
taxes.

Given today's debate around the BEE Bill, the irony  and  duplicity  of  the
Government's position on the Liquor Bill is staggering. The  damage  to  the
detail in its amending Bill is so great as to all but destroy  the  original
intent.

The DA strongly  supports  the  Bill's  aims,  but  we  disagree,  at  times
fundamentally,  with  many  of  the  proposals  and  mechanisms  for   their
fulfilment and attainment. We will oppose the Bill. I thank you.

Dr R H DAVIES: Mr Chairperson, I'm not going to  respond  in  detail  to  Mr
Lowe. I'll refer to  some  points  as  I  go  along.  I  want  to  begin  by
elaborating on a point which was made by the Minister in  his  introduction,
namely that the history of liquor in  this  country  has  been  inextricably
linked to  the  history  of  exploitation  and  oppression  associated  with
colonialism and apartheid.

At the end of the nineteenth century, liquor  was  actively  promoted  among
the people of so-called African reserves, as a means of creating a need  for
money income that would induce people from these areas  to  make  themselves
available as  low-paid  migrant  workers  in  the  mining  industry.  Liquor
consumption was also actively promoted as a  mechanism  for  recruitment  of
labour for white-owned farms, and even in this province, in particular,  was
supplied to workers in lieu of money wages under the notorious dop system.

When mining  capital  later  found  that  other  recruiting  mechanisms  and
devices had become sufficiently entrenched and  that  the  disadvantages  of
liquor abuse on labour productivity in the mining  industry  outweighed  the
advantages in terms of recruitment, it led a crusade  which  resulted  in  a
policy of prohibition directed at African people.

For much of the twentieth century, the sale of liquor to African people  was
illegal, except for  the  sale  of  sorghum  beer  in  government-controlled
beerhalls that served as mechanisms of social control and to  raise  revenue
for so-called bantu administration.

It's not surprising, therefore, that these beerhalls  became  targets,  from
time to time, of protests and mass action, most notably  by  women,  in  the
1950s and 1960s. It's not surprising either that a  thriving  illegal  trade
emerged, with shebeens becoming a more acceptable  outlet  than  government-
run beerhalls. In  the  atmosphere  of  extreme  restriction  on  commercial
activities by African people, shebeens indeed became  an  important  way  of
generating income for a significant number of people.

At the same time, policy in relation to  liquor  manufacturing  was  closely
associated with struggles between different vested interests  in  the  white
power bloc and the subject, therefore, of much partisan state  intervention.
Excise tax policy favoured politically well-connected wine farmers over  the
near-monopoly beer brewer in this country.

In the 1980s, when the prospects for wine exports were limited by  sanctions
and international isolation, grocery shops  were  allowed  to  apply  for  a
grocer's wine licence, which was not available to other  products.  Monopoly
power was used, most notably by the beer brewer, to gain control  of  retail
and wholesale outlets and to exclude competitors' products.  The  system  of
liquor  licensing  provided  for   in   pre-1994   legislation,   and   more
particularly  in  the  1989   Liquor   Act,   was   expensive,   cumbersome,
bureaucratic and subject to partisanship.

Marx, quoting Hegel, once remarked that the past weighs down on the  present
like a nightmare. This is patently  so  in  the  case  of  liquor.  We  have
inherited a reality in  which  alcohol  abuse  still  remains  an  extremely
serious social problem. The impact of this reaches far  beyond  the  problem
of individual addiction found in all countries and recognised by  the  World
Health Organisation as a clinical illness.

In  addition  to  alcoholism,  we  confront  serious   abuse,   inextricably
intertwined with poverty and inequality, and indeed reinforcing poverty  and
inequality. According to  a  recent  communication  from  the  Western  Cape
provincial government, half of  all  our  natural  deaths  in  South  Africa
involve people with high levels of alcohol in their bloodstreams.

The dop system may be dead as far as the formal provision of liquor in  lieu
of wages is concerned, but unfortunately it persists in some  cases  in  the
form of the supply of liquor as an inducement or  incentive  in  the  labour
process. Foetal alcohol syndrome, which is  the  intergenerational  transfer
of the effects of alcohol abuse, is unfortunately rife in  areas  where  the
dopsystem was well established.

Ninety-five percent  of  the  retail  distribution  of  liquor  takes  place
outside of the officially regulated licensing system provided for under  the
1989 Act. A submission to portfolio committee hearings  from  the  Voluntary
Association of Shebeeners in the Western Cape indicated  that  less  than  a
quarter of the estimated number of shebeens in this  province  were  subject
to the association's voluntary code of conduct, preventing prostitution  and
drug selling, among other things.

The  liquor  manufacturing  and   distribution   industry   remains   highly
concentrated, and there are significant barriers  to  entry  for  newcomers.
This, Mr Lowe, I regret to say, is  not  a  context  in  which  free  market
principles can be appropriate. This is and has to be a regulated industry.

The Bill before the House is the  product  of  a  long  process,  which  was
described  by  the  Minister,  which  included  profound  debates   on   the
appropriate regulatory framework. As the Minister indicated, a  Liquor  Bill
was adopted by Parliament in 1998 and referred by President Mandela  to  the
Constitutional Court for an opinion, due to the fact that  the  Constitution
defines liquor licensing as an exclusive provincial competence.

I'm not sure that  Mr  Lowe  understood  the  Constitutional  Court  ruling,
because  the  Constitutional  Court  upheld  the  principle  that   national
Government could intervene and regulate  the  production  of  a  potentially
harmful substance, as  well  as  set  norms  and  standards  for  provincial
licensing. But the Constitutional Court ruled that the mode and  proceedings
for  licensing  of  retail  and  micromanufacturing  must  be  an  exclusive
provincial competence.

The basic principles of the 1998 Bill, in the  context  of  that  rule,  are
carried forward in the Bill which we have before us today. One principle  is
the establishment of a flexible three-tier system in  which,  by  and  large
and with some exceptions, those involved in  the  liquor  industry  will  be
able to receive a registration to be a  manufacturer,  a  distributor  or  a
retailer of liquor products, but not all three. The other principle is  that
all players in the industry must  abide  by  norms  and  standards  of  good
practice.

It was a disappointment to many of us in the portfolio  committee  that  the
public  hearings  did  not  attract  many  submissions  on  public  interest
provisions. However, I'm happy to be  able  to  report  to  the  House  that
committee members applied their minds and actively engaged on these  issues,
resulting, I believe, in their significant strengthening and improvement.

The Bill before us seeks comprehensively to prohibit the supply  of  alcohol
by employers  as  any  part  of  the  establishment  or  maintenance  of  an
employment relationship. The Bill bans the sale  of  methylated  spirits  or
any similar product as  liquor.  It  also  prohibits  the  addition  of  any
impotable substance to alcoholic beverages.

Other public interest provisions include  a  ban  on  false  and  misleading
advertising, the prohibition of liquor sales to minors and a provision  that
the Minister may  consult  with  the  Health  Minister  on  possible  health
warnings on  alcoholic  products.  Beyond  this,  all  participants  in  the
industry are placed  under  a  specific  obligation  to  contribute  to  the
combating of alcohol abuse.

As indicated earlier, the Constitutional Court ruled that the competence  of
national Government in the issuing of liquor  registrations  is  limited  to
manufacturing and distribution, which is  indeed  logical  in  view  of  the
structure of the industry. Registration of retail and micromanufacturing  is
an exclusive provincial competence.

All observers  appear  to  agree  that  the  biggest  challenge  facing  the
regulation of the liquor industry lies in the retail sphere,  where  95%  of
current sales are estimated to be taking place  within  unlicensed  outlets.
Although this will have to proceed on the basis of provincial law, the  Bill
before us sets up a framework for intergovernmental  co-operation  and  sets
criteria that will hopefully find echoes at all levels.

Registration to conduct activity in the liquor industry will be  granted  in
return for specific commitments and obligations. These  include  commitments
to contribute to combating alcohol abuse and  to  promoting  black  economic
empowerment. The Minister is also obliged to  evaluate  any  application  in
terms of the extent to which a registration will  restrict  or  promote  new
entry, will create jobs and will promote diversity of ownership.

The Bill before us, as was the case with the original draft  of  this  Bill,
provides for a flexible three-tier system. The norm will be to  fall  within
one of the three tiers, but there is provision for some latitude.  This  was
the subject of most submissions that the committee received from  interested
parties in the industry. It led to a decision to allow  the  department  and
key players to go away and see if they could reach an agreement on the  mode
of operation of this flexibility.

The Bill before us today is the product of the process which I  believe  has
improved the Bill, not led  to  its  departure  from  these  principles,  by
clarifying the extent of the flexibility and the basis on which it  will  be
applied. Basically, a manufacturer will  be  able  to  sell  liquor  it  has
manufactured to a retailer as well as to a distributor, if the terms of  its
registration permit this. The Bill makes it clear that in  order  to  access
this flexibility, applicants will be required to meet  a  higher  threshold,
in terms of the criteria for registration, than those who do not seek it.

This Bill, I believe, will be a step towards  a  central  regulation  of  an
industry producing a potentially harmful product,  but  an  industry,  also,
which can contribute to exports, to income and to  jobs.  I  therefore  have
pleasure in commending it to the House. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B C NGIBA: Mr Chairperson, the Bill  before  us  today  has  travelled  a
long, arduous and sometimes tortuous journey. This journey started  with  an
initial  joint  review  of  the  statutes  dealing  with  the   manufacture,
distribution and sale of liquor by the national and  provincial  departments
in 1994, and  culminated  in  the  tabling  of  the  first  Liquor  Bill  in
Parliament in 1998.

After  its  adoption,  the  Bill  was  referred  by  the  President  to  the
Constitutional Court to get clarity on its constitutionality.  In  the  end,
some parts of that Bill were found to be unconstitutional  and  a  new  Bill
was drafted to correct those problems. In  a  nutshell,  that  is  where  we
stand today.

In essence, the Bill provides for: Firstly, the  establishment  of  national
norms and standards in order to maintain economic unity  within  the  liquor
industry; secondly,  essential  national  standards  and  minimum  standards
required  for  the  rendering  of  liquor-related  services;  thirdly,   the
regulation  of  the  micromanufacture  and  retail  sale   of   liquor   for
consumption by default;  and  fourthly,  measures  to  promote  co-operative
governance in the area of liquor regulation.

The IFP welcomes the fact that the Bill does not provide for the  regulation
of the  micromanufacture  or  sale  of  liquor  for  consumption  except  by
default.  We  also  welcome  the  fact  that  the  Bill  allows   provincial
governments to legislate on liquor matters, except for a  number  of  public
interest prohibitions,  provisions  relating  to  vertical  integration  and
national norms and standards.

Although the IFP is  a  party  known  for  its  commitment  to  the  greater
devolution of powers and functions to the provinces, we are  satisfied  that
the national norms and  standards  are  necessary  for  the  maintenance  of
economic realities in  an  industry  that  provides  large-scale  employment
throughout the country. The effects of  providing  services  in  the  liquor
industry may vary depending on the  environment,  but  we  acknowledge  that
minimum standards should apply across the national territory.

Despite the fears of other parties, the IFP still supports the  creation  of
a National Liquor  Policy  Council  on  which  the  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry and the provincial MECs will serve. In establishing national  norms
and standards, it is clear  that  a  national/provincial  co-ordinating  and
policy formulating body will  be  required.  This  body  will  no  doubt  be
responsible for ensuring that  the  principles  of  co-operative  governance
enshrined in the Constitution are consistently applied and enforced.

The objectives of the Liquor Bill are twofold: Firstly, it has a social  and
health policy component in that it seeks to  reduce  the  socioeconomic  and
other costs of alcohol consumption to the population and the  country  as  a
whole. This is a laudable objective but one has to wonder  whether  it  goes
far enough in its scope or  whether  this  objective  would  not  be  better
served in dedicated health legislation. Standards and norms are  one  thing,
but as hon members will know, individual behaviour in  relation  to  alcohol
consumption is quite another.

Secondly, the Bill has an economic component in that  it  seeks  to  promote
access for new participants  into  the  liquor  industry,  thereby  creating
diversity of ownership. This objective cannot be faulted in  principle,  and
we believe that the Bill will play a decisive role in this regard.  However,
care must be taken not to fragment  our  national  goal  of  black  economic
empowerment through a plethora of statutes  that  set  different  conditions
for different sectors of the  economy.  It  is  exactly  this  fragmentation
potential that has led to the adoption  of  the  BEE  framework  legislation
earlier today.

The IFP will support the Liquor Bill. Thank you.

Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, in the Abuse of  Dependence-producing  Substances
and Rehabilitation Centres Act, Act 41 of 1971,  alcohol  is  defined  as  a
dependence-producing substance.

The first alcoholic liquor factory in South Africa was  called  ``De  Eerste
Fabrieken in de Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek'' - ``The First Factory  in  the
South African Republic''. In 1883 President Kruger  personally  declared  it
open and gave it the curious name of ``Volkshoop'' - people's  hope.  Today,
according to the latest statistics, South Africans consume  more  than  five
billion litres of alcoholic beverages every year, which is  120  litres  per
person.

I think we all know the background of  this  Bill,  and  I'm  not  going  to
repeat what other members have said. The impetus behind the  formulation  of
the new Liquor Bill, policy and legislation is primarily  twofold:  Firstly,
to ensure the effective regulation of the liquor industry, particularly  the
sale of liquor in order to minimise the potentially harmful consequences  of
liquor on our society, thereby promoting an ethos of  social  responsibility
in the industry; and secondly, to address the historical  legacy  of  liquor
regulation in South Africa through restructuring the liquor industry.

As the hon  Minister  has  already  mentioned,  one  has  to  recognise  the
historical context of  the  liquor  industry  and  its  evolution  in  South
Africa, as well as its legacy of  segregation  and  economic  concentration.
The structure of the liquor industry and its ownership is the direct  result
of the history of liquor regulation in South Africa.

Various forms of  legislation  were  promulgated  to  prohibit  blacks  from
producing and obtaining liquor in the past. As a  result,  a  large  illegal
and unregulated industry was created -  a  monster  in  fact.  More  than  a
quarter of  a  million  illegal  liquor  outlets,  which  are  today  called
shebeens  and  taverns,  emerged,   while   the   formal   industry   became
concentrated in the hands of a few.

The former regime adopted an  approach  that  resulted  in  constant  raids,
harassment, arrests,  prosecutions  and  imprisonment  of  blacks.  It  also
precipitated  an  inordinate  amount  of  social  decay,  family   violence,
township violence, alcohol-related  diseases,  crime,  accidents  and  work-
related problems in the black community.

We  must  recognise  that  liquor,  as  a  potentially  harmful  dependence-
producing substance, needs much stricter regulation.  We  need  to  regulate
the manufacture, distribution and sale of liquor with a flexible  three-tier
system and, as far as possible, ensure more  effective  empowerment  of  the
disadvantaged sector of our population. Of course, we also  need  to  ensure
compliance and imposition of severe penalties for violations.

The Bill also introduces a new element, the establishment  of  the  National
Liquor Policy Council, which will consist  of  the  Minister  of  Trade  and
Industry  and  the  relevant  members  of  the  executive  councils  of  the
provinces.

Finally, the constitutional concerns  and  reservations  expressed  in  1999
have been addressed in the Bill. So it is now over  to  our  nine  provinces
also to play their part in reducing the socioeconomic  and  other  costs  of
alcohol consumption, we hope with as much uniformity as possible.

In closing, the New NP supports the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]
Mr S  N  SWART:  Chairman,  hon  Minister,  the  objectives  of  this  Bill,
particularly  those  pertaining  to  preventing  alcohol   abuse   and   the
accompanying socioeconomic costs, are welcomed and supported by the ACDP.  I
wish, however, to focus on the issue of closed days, today.

Whilst the ACDP fully  appreciates  that  the  retail  sector  is  the  sole
jurisdiction of provinces, I would implore provinces and NCOP  delegates  to
ensure that provincial legislation  retains  the  concept  of  closed  days,
namely Christmas Day, Good Friday  and  Sundays,  prohibiting  the  sale  of
liquor by retailers such as corner cafés, supermarkets and Seven-Eleven.

In the 1997 Constitutional Court case of  Lawrence  and  Others  versus  the
Minister of Trade and Industry , the Constitutional Court  upheld  the  then
applicable Liquor Act that prohibited such stores  from  selling  liquor  on
those days. The  then  Attorney-General  stated  that  there  was  a  direct
relationship between the consumption of alcohol and violent crime, and  that
if restrictions on the times at which and the types of  liqour  which  could
be sold by supermarkets were removed, there would  be  an  increase  in  the
consumption of liquor to the prejudice of the community.

The Constitutional Court then found that liquor was in  fact  a  potentially
harmful  substance  and  that  the  excessive  consumption  of  liquor   was
universally regarded as a social evil. It is linked  to  crime,  disturbance
of the public order, impairment of road safety, damage to  health,  and  has
other derelicterious social and economic consequences.

Hon Minister, during this case you  relied  on  a  Christian  as  an  expert
witness. Marcel Christian was her name, and she said that a  large  body  of
recent research studies had found  that  the  relaxation  of  controls  over
availability, such as expansion of the type,  number  of  outlets,  extended
days and hours of operation, etc,  not  only  encouraged  consumption  among
modest drinkers but also among so-called heavy drinkers.

In view of this finding of the Constitutional Court, as well as  the  stated
objectives of the Bill, the ACDP strongly recommends  that  closed  days  be
included in  the  provincial  legislation  that  will  regulate  the  retail
sector. I thank you. [Time expired.]

Ms N C NKABINDE: Chair, hon Minister and  hon  members,  the  importance  of
properly regulating the liquor industry is beyond doubt. In  economic  terms
the industry generates billions of rands a year  in  turnover  and  provides
employment for thousands of South Africans. As  a  sector  of  the  economy,
this industry faces the same challenges as other sectors to allow  fair  and
equitable participation for all stakeholders, especially for  entrants  from
previously  disadvantaged  communities.  In   social   terms,   the   proper
regulation of liquor in order to avoid abuse and a host of  social  ills  is
vital.

It is imperative that stringent monitoring of the provisions of  clauses  8,
9 and  10  is  implemented.  The  employment  of  minors,  the  practice  of
substituting remuneration for  liquor,  the  enticement  of  minors  to  use
liquor through advertising, and the selling of  liquor  to  minors  are  all
matters that strike at the very core of our social fabric. These are  abuses
which must once and for all be eradicated from our society.

We agree with  the  high  standards  set  in  Chapter  3  of  the  Bill  for
registration in respect of manufacturing  and/or  distributing  liquor.  The
provisions of Chapters 4 and 5 to ensure compliance and  penalise  offenders
are necessary and show that the basic intention of Chapter 3  and  the  Bill
as a whole will not be undermined.

There are those who would argue that the industry is  entitled  to  regulate
itself and that Government would begin overregulating  if  it  pursues  this
Bill. We disagree with this argument that seems  to  propose  that  when  it
comes to a potentially disruptive substance such as liquor, we can sit  back
and believe that economics do  not  become  an  overriding  motivation  that
casts social responsibility aside in the pursuit of profit.

The UDM supports the Bill.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairman, the PAC welcomes many aspects of  this  Bill.  For
instance, clause 4 states that a person may not  manufacture  liquor  unless
he or she is registered as a manufacturer in terms of  this  Bill,  or  sell
liquor without being licensed.

Clause 5 deals with the concoctions used in liquor which  are  dangerous  to
human health. Some of those mentioned are  isishimane,  qediviki,  skokiaan,
and barberton. Our only question is: Are such dangerous drinks limited  only
to African brewers? Are there no other  people  who  brew  health-destroying
liquor?

Clause 10 prohibits the sale of liquor to minors. Indeed,  minors  ought  to
be drinking from the fountains of education instead of  being  destroyed  by
liquor prematurely.  The  Bill  also  prohibits  the  sale  of  liquor  near
schools. The PAC thinks this is a good thing.

Clause 9 prohibits drunken  behaviour  on  registered  premises.  Clause  10
prohibits the consumption of liquor on any  road,  street,  lane  or  vacant
land in an urban area. The establishment  of  these  national  standards  is
essential.

It must be observed that excessive use of liquor has never built  a  nation.
This Bill, however, could  contribute  to  the  promotion  of  the  economic
empowerment of the majority population of the have-nots  if  the  suppliers,
and ultimately the producers, are African businessmen and  -women.  Africans
are too often consumers and a market for others  who  enrich  themselves  at
their expense.

The provision for inspection  of  premises  in  clause  32,  to  investigate
complaints, monitor and enforce compliance, is essential.

The PAC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Malibongwe igama lamakhosikazi! [Praise  the  name  of  the
women!] Thank you, Chairperson.

The Department of Trade and Industry and the provincial departments  have  a
great responsibility  jointly  managing  and  regulating  the  Liquor  Bill,
taking into consideration the procedures in terms of section  76(1)  of  the
Constitution, since it involves an intervention in terms  of  section  14(2)
of the Constitution.

The MF is, however, very concerned about how the Bill  will  deal  with  the
community where unlicensed operations take place and liquor is  supplied  to
minors.  Alcohol  has  become  the  norm  today.  However,   the   extensive
communication with the industries and other stakeholders through  provincial
workshops and the national media is greatly welcomed.  Hopefully  this  will
alleviate some of the above problems in the community.

It is also encouraging to note that sufficient funding is available  in  the
current budget for the additional staff required to  perform  the  licensing
and inspection functions. The establishment of the  National  Liquor  Policy
Council, which will consist of  the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry  and
members of the executive councils of provinces,  is  a  move  in  the  right
direction.

The MF supports the Liquor Bill and wishes  the  Minister  and  his  council
every success in their endeavours. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mnu J MOLOI: Chairperson, Minister, Deputy Ministers, hon members, today  we
present before the House the Liquor Bill.

Ezindaweni  zasemakhaya  noma  khona  emadolobheni  lapho  kufudukele  khona
abansundu  ngenxa  yokufuna  imisebenzi,  kuyaye  kuthi  uma   sekuphunyulwe
kuhleziwe kusha ingxoxo, kube khona okubekwa  phakathi  kwenkundla  nokhamba
lugcwele. Leso isiphuzo sabantu esibizwa ngokuthi umqombothi.

Emishadweni   nasemigidini   uma   kuhlangenwe,    kujatshuliwe,    kufinywa
ngendololwane kusho nengoma - not with instruments, not  with  bass  guitars
and not with the organ (hhayi ngezinsimbi, hhayi  ngezigingci  nange  ogani)
kodwa ngehubo elihlanganisiwe  nokushaya  izandla.  Lapho  sesiyagiya  futhi
sikhomba ngophakathi. Sishaya indlamu kusho  nomqombothi  ovovwe  ngezandla,
wavuma, wakhihliza amagwebu. Siyakuzwela wena ongakwazi ukuvova.  [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J MOLOI: In rural  areas  or  even  in  cities,  where  African  migrant
workers get together, they often sit  down,  relax  and  chat  while  having
something to eat. The food is usually accompanied by a calabash  of  African
beer. Shame on you if you do not know how to brew it!

At weddings and festivities people meet to celebrate and enjoy  a  meal  and
some music together - not with instruments, not with bass  guitars  and  not
with an organ, but with a song composed  together  and  applause.  There  we
dance and enjoy. We perform the African  dance  and  drink  perfectly  home-
brewed and bubbling sorghum beer. [Applause.]]

This process is referred to as ``manufacturing'' in terms of  this  Bill.  A
famous way for Africans to celebrate will  never  be  complete  without  the
famous traditional African beer. That is why  we  find  people  like  Yvonne
Chakachaka singing ``WeMaDlamini uphi  umqombothi''  [``MaDlamini  where  is
the African beer'',] because this drink brings  joy.  When  such  activities
take place, it is referred to as ``manufacturing of  liquor''  and  in  this
case the manufacturing of African beer for consumption. It  is  for  private
consumption.

Gone are the days when the police would harass our people  just  for  having
fun and unwinding. No more will it  happen  that  this  delicious  drink  is
spilt on the ground while manufacturers are  arrested.  If  you  manufacture
for consumption,  this  Government  protects  you.  Songs  such  as  ``Nanka
amaphoyisa azongena endlini mama, khawuleza'' [``The  police  are  about  to
enter the house, mama, hurry up''] will only refer to the past.

What should be clear, even  to  larger  industries,  is  that  manufacturing
should be understood purely as  manufacturing  and  does  not  automatically
mean importing, since manufacturing and importing are two  separate  issues.
Again, manufacturing for the purpose  of  selling  will  thus  be  regulated
under micromanufacturing, ie, for smaller quantities.

This Government would be irresponsible if  trading  or  business  in  liquor
could not be regulated. As much  as  liquor  cannot  be  prohibited,  it  is
important to regulate the selling of liquor so that the  industry  does  not
become laissez faire or a free for all.

In order for us to understand the Liquor Bill, it is important,  of  course,
to do some revision of the background of this Bill.  Efforts  to  drive  the
new Liquor Bill started in 1994. That  Bill  was  tabled  in  Parliament  in
August 1998, but ended up in the Constitutional Court in  terms  of  section
84(2) of the Constitution, on 2 November of the same year.

The Constitutional  Court  ruled  that  the  Bill  was  unconstitutional  in
certain respects - not all of the Bill but certain aspects of the Bill.  The
Constitutional Court was of the view that the national  Government  had  the
power to regulate the liquor industry but not liquor licensing,  a  function
regarded as an exclusive provincial legislative competence,  unless  it  was
necessary to do so under section 44 of  the  Constitution.  Accordingly,  it
was constitutional for the national Government to regulate  the  manufacture
and distribution of liquor by establishing a single system  of  registration
nationally.

On the other hand, the regulation of  the  micromanufacture  and  retail  of
liquor was the exclusive preserve of  provincial  government,  unless  there
were compelling reasons for national Government to intervene. The  amendment
of the Liquor Bill was thus drafted in order to match the  constitutionality
of the Liquor Act of 1989, as  the  Bill  had  to  comply  with  the  recent
Constitutional Court judgment on this matter.

As a result, the Bill in front of us now structures the liquor  industry  in
the following categories: in terms of manufacturing,  distribution  and  the
retail  sale  of  liquor.  The  distinction  between  a   manufacturer   and
micromanufacturer is determined by the volume of liquor manufactured.
The principal tool of regulation of the liquor industry is the  registration
of those who  make,  distribute  and  sell  liquor.  Accordingly,  the  Bill
requires all manufacturers, distributors and sellers to be  registered.  The
registration of micromanufacturers and retail sellers  of  liquor  is  dealt
with by the provincial liquor authorities established under  the  provincial
legislation, or in the absence of such, the provision of default applies.

Pending  the  appointment  of  the  members   of   the   provincial   liquor
authorities, the Liquor Board established under the Liquor Act  of  1989  is
deemed to be the authority contemplated in  the  provincial  legislation  of
the default registration, as the case may be.

Again, the Bill, in line with the  decision  of  the  Constitutional  Court,
divides responsibility for these tiers  of  industry  between  national  and
provincial governments. It treats manufacturing and distribution  of  liquor
as a national domain. The registration  of  manufacturers  and  distributors
constitutes   a   national   competence.    The    Bill    recognises    the
micromanufacturer and the retail sale of liquor as a provincial  competency.
It further creates a national licensing function  for  the  manufacture  and
wholesale sale of liquor, in line with the  Constitutional  Court  judgment,
and it sets out norms and standards.

The new Bill provides for a policy formulation and  co-ordination  mechanism
in the form of a policy council, which consists of  the  Minister  of  Trade
and Industry and the members of the executive  councils  of  the  provinces,
giving official practical expression and  content  to  the  concept  of  co-
operative  legislative  governance,  as  set  out  in  Chapter  3   of   the
Constitution.

The whole process of  registering  ministerial  approval  essentially  means
that a person may not be both the manufacturer and distributor or  seller  -
or all three for that matter - but can be one. An example is the SAB,  which
controls approximately 97% of the beer market and proves to be  a  monopoly.
There is no room for other businesses to enter the market.  This  becomes  a
good example of nonstate intervention, with the hope that  the  market  will
create equality in the economy.

The principal reason for this policy is the dilution  of  the  concentration
of  power  in  manufacturing,  limiting  the  vertical  integration  of  the
industry  and  the  creation  of  opportunities  for  new  entrants  to  the
industry, particularly  those  drawn  from  the  historically  disadvantaged
groups. The separation was thus aimed at those corporations that  use  their
position at one level to purposely exclude others.

A distributor may only sell to a retailer. A retailer may  only  sell  to  a
consumer. The terms and  conditions  included  in  the  licence  will  guard
against  any  unfair  competition.  The  Bill  has  to   ensure   that   the
inequalities that  currently  exist  are  not  perpetuated,  and  the  costs
involved in ensuring this also have  to  be  considered.  The  Minister  may
permit a manufacturer to distribute its  own  products  to  retailers  under
limited  circumstances  if  it  serves  economic  efficiency.  However,  the
Minister  has  to  consider  the  efficiency  created  and  the   need   for
transparency in making the decision.

Provincial hearings were held and all  provinces  presented  various  inputs
and cases. The processes of implementing varied from  one  province  to  the
other. The pace of implementation happens to be advanced in  some  provinces
while others are still at the research phase. Hopefully today's debate  will
serve as an impetus in  accelerating  such  research.  There  are  provinces
which still argued that national Parliament had to conclude the Liquor  Bill
in order for them to kickstart, or proceed with, their process.

Gauteng, for example, is two years into having enacted the  liquor  law  and
managed to share  its  experiences  on  the  implementation  thereof.  As  a
result, this  exercise  demonstrated  critically  the  unequal  ability  and
capacity of various provinces on issues of development.

As a responsible society we must remain accountable to the values and  norms
that we have set.  Accountability  has  to  be  vested  in  the  responsible
citizens who will deal with the liquor legislation in a way  that  does  not
damage our society.

We appreciate the provision in the Bill that stipulates that  liquor  cannot
be sold to minors. To us it is a moral issue that we fully support.

As much as umqombothi is a traditional African beer,  famous  and  loved  by
its fans, it would  be  wrong  to  dilute  impotable  substances  inherently
harmful and unfit for human consumption. We cannot associate imbamba,  which
is diluted with battery acid and other harmful substances, with  umqombothi,
a healthy drink. We need to be clear in our minds  that  all  substances  in
liquor inherently unfit for human consumption are illegal, and indulging  in
this will be in violation of the law.

In conclusion,  this  Bill  encapsulates  the  policy  principle  previously
agreed to  with  stakeholders,  but  addresses  the  constitutional  matters
raised. We are glad to support a Bill that encourages applicants  to  commit
themselves to  a  broad  black  economic  empowerment  that  encourages  new
entrants  into  the  liquor  industry   and   creates   jobs.   Furthermore,
applicants' proposal to combat alcohol abuse will  indicate  value  attached
to human nature rather than unscrupulously making money without  regard  for
the human factors.

The ANC supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, I think that the inputs  of
the majority in this House have supported the general direction in which  we
have been taking this industry. I think there is clear majority support  for
the concept that this industry should be regulated, that it's  correct  that
it should be regulated. It does have particular features,  and  the  product
that it produces does have individual and social effects.

I think that the majority of sensible people in this House are  quite  clear
that we should regulate this. The issue at stake  was  how  this  should  be
done within the parameters  of  our  Constitution  which,  quite  correctly,
apportions different powers to different levels of government. I believe  we
have met our obligations in providing for that regulation, both in terms  of
its industrial dimensions, and in terms of ensuring that  there  are  public
interest concerns that are met and complied with.

I am also very pleased that the hon Moloi has raised what I think is a  very
important aspect,  and  that  is  that  provided  we  do  keep  this  within
regulated bounds, we are in fact opening a whole new set  of  prospects  and
possibilities as to what the liquor industry could  be  and  what  it  could
achieve.

Many of you have probably already seen the possibilities that  are  emerging
in   various   micromanufacturers   throughout   this   country,   producing
traditional brews of various types, producing beers, wines  and  many  other
products. As I stressed, provided we keep  this  within  the  parameters  of
regulation,  we  are  truly  opening  up  a  new  set  of  experiences   and
possibilities for the people of South Africa, and all its people,  not  just
industrial conglomerates.

You may have noticed that, as was quite predictable, the  spokesperson  from
the DA in effect accused me of being corrupt.  His  words  were  that  there
were people who felt I had been bought. Mr Lowe, I  find  this  contemptuous
conduct, but I cannot expect you to understand the measure of who  I  am  or
the measure of the comrades that I have walked with.  But,  Chairperson,  it
does seem to me that these kinds of  gratuitous  accusations  of  corruption
will only detract from the gravitas of this House. I  don't  expect  him  to
understand.  He's  a  little  twerp  whose  done  nothing   in   his   past.
[Interjections.]

But, I think for the House, if every time you don't like something  that  is
done by someone else or you disagree with the policy, you say  he's  bought.
Now, I don't know if he's bought by the liquor industry or not ...

Mr  I  J  PRETORIUS:  Chairperson,  in  my  view,  the  word  ``twerp''   is
unparliamentary,  and  I  request  you   to   make   a   ruling   on   that.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Seeing that you've raised it,  I  want
to address Mr Lowe.

I did hear Mr Lowe saying that the Minister had been  bought,  in  whichever
language. I would like to ask Mr Lowe that, if that  is  what  he  said,  he
withdraw it. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Don't deny it now.

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairman, if you'd been listening to my speech,  you'd  have
heard that I said that ``Some commentators had said that  the  Minister  had
been bought''. I did not say that  the  Minister  had  been  bought.  I  was
simply repeating what some commentators in the  media  had  said.  There  is
nothing to withdraw.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, I must ask you to  withdraw  that
comment.

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairman, if I didn't say it,  it's  impossible  for  me  to
withdraw it. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Lowe, from what I heard at the time,  and
we had made a note of it, we were convinced that that  was  what  you  said.
Now, I would like you to withdraw the comment that  the  Minister  had  been
bought.

Mr C M LOWE: With respect, Chairman, then you'll have to check  the  record,
because I did not say that. So, I need the record to be  checked.  I  cannot
withdraw something I did not say. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Lowe, I am going to put it  to  you  this
way: Even the quotation  is  unacceptable.  I  want  you  to  withdraw  that
comment.

Mr C M LOWE: Chair, I don't believe that the quotation is  unacceptable.  It
appeared in the press, in the media. I simply repeated what  had  been  said
in the media. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I am going to ask you for the last  time,  Mr
Lowe, to please withdraw the comment.

Mr C M LOWE: Mr Chairman, if I didn't say it, I can't withdraw it. I  didn't
say the Minister had been bought. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, order! Mr  Gibson,  please  take  your
seat. I am going to look at Hansard, and I will give a ruling when  we  have
the next debate.

Mr Lowe, we will look at the Hansard. We will ascertain what you  said,  and
we will report back to the House.

Mr M RAMGOBIN: Mr Chairperson, on a further point of order: I thought it  is
procedural that once a chairperson or presiding officer asks a member  three
times to withdraw, that statement must be withdrawn.  [Interjections.]  That
person must be given his marching orders.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon  member.  We  will  deal  with
that when we report back  to  the  House.  Please  continue,  hon  Minister.
[Interjections.]

I want to close this matter. We are reporting back to the House. Can  I  ask
that we suspend this discussion. The Chair will  look  at  Hansard,  and  we
will report back to the House and give a ruling. [Interjections.]

I recognise Mr Gibson and then Mr Turok.

Mr D H M GIBSON: Chairperson, there is an existing  point  of  order,  which
the hon Mr Pretorius took, and you haven't considered it  or  ruled  on  it.
The hon Minister referred to the  hon  Mr  Lowe  as  a  ``twerp''.  That  is
unparliamentary. You were listening when he said it. I ask you to  tell  the
Minister to withdraw that unparliamentary comment. [Interjections.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will look at  that  comment  as  well,  and
give a ruling on that.

Prof  B  TUROK:  Chairperson,  I  think,  in  this  incident,  there  was  a
disrespect of the Chair. The hon Lowe said, ``If you'd been listening to  my
speech, you'd have heard ... '', etc. It seems to me that its  disrespectful
of the hon Lowe to say to the Chair ``If you'd  been  listening  ...  ''.  I
think  that's  disrespectful,  and  I  think  he   should   withdraw   that.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Turok, I have said that we will  look  at
Hansard, and we will give a ruling out in the House. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE  AND  INDUSTRY:  Mr  Chairperson,  if  you  rule  that
``twerp'' is unparliamentary, I will withdraw  it.  I  said  that.  If  it's
unparliamentary and you order me to withdraw it, I will withdraw.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Minister.
The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Chair.

Let me address more serious matters that were raised by people who  seem  to
have a greater concern for their communities. The hon member  Miss  Rajbally
pointed out quite correctly  that  she  has  concerns  that  in  communities
themselves, we need to ensure that these public interest matters  are  dealt
with and are of concern. This is  the  reason  why  we  specifically  had  a
workshop in the NCOP, working with the provincial authorities.

It is quite clear that the total  system  needs  to  be  in  place.  As  was
originally conceived and is still conceived of in this legislation,  we  are
seeking to ensure that what is a massive illegal industry is  legalised.  We
should not be making criminals out of ordinary people.

Therefore, we do need to  make  sure  that  a  retail  licensing  system  is
introduced  and  that  the  prescriptions  regarding  public  interests  are
complied with. We've undertaken, as a national department, both through  the
National Liquor Policy Council and as  the  department,  to  work  with  our
colleagues in the provinces to get  that  system  in  place  as  quickly  as
possible. I think respected community leaders  can  play  a  very  important
role in facilitating this process.

Chairperson and those hon members that are honourable, thank  you  for  your
support for this Bill. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I would like to  remind  members  that
they may only vote from their allocated seats.  When  requested  to  do  so,
members must simply indicate their vote by pressing the appropriate  button.
If  a  member  inadvertently  presses  the  wrong  button,  the  member  may
thereafter press the  correct  button.  The  last  button  pressed  will  be
recorded as the member's vote when the  voting  session  is  closed  by  the
Chair.

The House divided:

     June 2003 to  the  Speaker  of  the  National  Assembly  informing  the

     EMPLOYMENT  OF  THE  SOUTH  AFRICAN  NATIONAL  DEFENCE  FORCE  IN   THE
     DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO AND  UGANDA  IN  THE  FULFILLMENT  OF  THE
     INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA  TOWARDS  THE
     UNITED NATIONS


     This serves to inform the National Assembly that on  the  20th  day  of
     June Two Thousand and Three, I authorised the employment of  the  South
     African National Defence Force (SANDF) personnel to the  North  Eastern
     part of the Republic of Congo and Uganda for service  as  part  of  the
     Interim  Emergency   Multinational   Force   to   contribute   to   the
     stabilisation of the security and humanitarian situation in Bunia.  The
     employment is in compliance with the United Nations Security Resolution
     1484 of 30 May 2003.


     This employment was authorised in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
     Section 82(4)(b)(ii) of the  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  South
     Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of 1993), [which section continues  to  be  in
     force in terms of Item 24(1) of Schedule 6 to the Constitution  of  the
     Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act No 108 of 1996], read with  Section
     201(2)(c) of the said Constitution of 1996, for service in  fulfillment
     of the international  obligations  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa
     towards the United Nations, in the Republic  of  Congo  and  Uganda  in
     terms of Section 227(1)(b) of the Constitution of 1993, (which  section
     is also still in force by virtue of the  aforementioned  Item  24)  and
     Section 18(1) read together with Section 11 of the  Defence  Act,  2002
     (Act No 42 of 2002).


     A total of twenty  five  (25)  will  be  employed,  consisting  of  the

     The expected cost of the deployment of personnel  to  the  mission  for
     three months until 1 September 2003, is R22.8 million.


     No provision has been  made  in  Defence's  allocation  to  cover  this
     expenditure. It is also not possible to accommodate the expenditure  by
     reprioritising current and/or future activities.  Defence's  allocation
     will need to be supplemented to continue with the deployment.


     The National Treasury officials have directed  that  unforeseeable  and
     unavoidable expenditure must be addressed through the budgetary process
     in the adjustments budget.


     I will also communicate this report to  the  Members  of  the  National
     Council of Provinces, and wish to request that you bring  the  contents
     of this report to the notice of the National Assembly.

     Letter from the President of the Republic dated 16 July 2003, addressed
     to the Speaker on  the  Report  on  the  Investigation  of  the  Public
     Protector on Minister Lekota:


         Madam Speaker


         REPORT ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE  PUBLIC  PROTECTOR  ON  MINISTER
         LEKOTA


         This serves to inform the National Assembly that on the  11th  July
         2003 I received a report from the  Public  Protector,  regarding  a
         complaint lodged against the Minister of Defence, Minister  M  G  P
         Lekota. A copy of the report is attached herewith.


         The complaint was lodged in  terms  of  section  4(1)(a)  by  Mr  D
         Gibson MP, a member of the  National  Assembly,  and  concerned  an
         alleged breach of paragraphs 3.6 and  6  of  the  Executive  Ethics
         Code.
         In summary, the findings of the Public Protector are:


         1. That there  has  been  no  conflict  of  interests  between  the
              interests that Minister Lekota had in the business  listed  in
              the report and his functions as a member of the Executive.


         2. That there has been a failure on the part  of  the  Minister  to
              declare some financial interest in the entities listed in  the
              report, but that imposing a penalty on the Minister  for  such
              failure would amount to double punishment, the Minister having
              been penalised by the National Assembly already.


         I accept the findings of the Public Protector.


         Having considered the Public Protector's findings,  the  report  of
         the Joint Committee on Members' Interest as well as the  fact  that
         the National Assembly has  penalised  the  Minister  for  the  non-
         disclosure, the Minister was  reprimanded  for  failure  to  comply
         fully with paragraph 6 of the Executive Ethics Code.


         Sincerely,






         T M MBEKI

     The following letter dated 19 June 2003 was received by the Speaker  of
     the National Assembly from the Minister  for  the  Public  Service  and
     Administration in  connection  with  an  extention  for  submission  of
     Strategic Plan: SAMDI:


     Dear Madam Speaker,


     EXTENTION FOR SUBMISSION OF STRATEGIC PLAN: SAMDI


     The South African Management  Development  Institute  (SAMDI)  recently
     experienced a number of difficulties. Amongst the challenges it had  to
     face, were the following:
     1.     The absence of a permanent Director-General in office  for  more
         than five months;


     2.     Ill-health experienced by the Deputy Director-General; and


     3.     The long vacancy of the Chief Financial Officer's position.


     Taking cognisance of these challenges, it was not possible to  finalise
     the strategic plan and submit it seven days prior to the  Budget  Vote,
     scheduled for 11 June 2003, as required  by  the  Treasury  and  Public
     Service Regulations.


     I have appointed a new Director-General with effect from 22 April 2003,
     and I instructed him to carefully assess the organisation and  then  to
     reposition it. My view is that a dramatic repositioning is required  to
     ensure the long-term sustainability of the organisation.  Clearly  this
     will require a thorough strategic planning process.


     The new  DG,  Mr  P  B  Soobrayan,  approached  National  Treasury  and
     requested a deviation from Treasury Regulation 5.2.1, which states that
     strategic plans must be tabled in Parliament at least seven days  prior
     to the discussion of the department's budget vote. (Copy of the  letter
     attached) National Treasury granted SAMDI extension of six  months  for
     the submission of its strategic plan, subject to the  Speaker  agreeing
     on an alternative date for the tabling of the strategic plan,  as  well
     as any other conditions that she may wish to attach to  this  approval.
     (Copy of the response attached).


     It is subsequently proposed that the new deadline for  the  tabling  of
     SAMDI's strategic plan be set at 30 November 2003. Should you  wish  to
     attach any  other  conditions  to  the  approval  granted  by  National
     Treasury, I will appreciate it if you can inform me accordingly.


     Your response in this regard is awaited.


     Yours sincerely,




     G J FRASER-MOLEKETI
     MINISTER

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development  on  Notice  in  terms  of   Interim   Rationalisation   of
     Jurisdiction of High Courts Act, 2001, dated 26 August 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the request  for  approval  by  Parliament  of  a
         Notice  which,  in  terms  of  section  2(1)(a)  of   the   Interim
         Rationalisation of Jurisdiction of High Courts Act, 2001  (Act  No.
         41 of 2001), alters the area  of  jurisdiction  for  which  a  High
         Court has been established, referred to  it,  recommends  that  the
         House, in terms of section  2(2)  of  the  said  Act,  approve  the
         Notice, as follows:


CREDA INSERT REPORT


     Request to be considered.

2.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the Criminal Procedure Amendment  Bill  [B  57  -  2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 27 August 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the subject of the Criminal  Procedure  Amendment
         Bill [B 57 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec  75),  referred  to  it
         and classified by the Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  as  a  section  75
         Bill, endorses the classification of the Bill and reports the  Bill
         with amendments [B 57A - 2002].


         The Committee wishes to report  further,  that  the  Bill  aims  to
         reintroduce the leave to appeal and petition procedures in  respect
         of decisions of the lower  courts.   The  provisions  dealing  with
         leave to appeal and petition procedures in the High Court are  also
         amended so  as  to,  among  others,  bring  it  in  line  with  the
         procedures contemplated in the lower courts.


         The Bill further  provides  that  certain  appeals  in  respect  of
         decisions in both the lower courts and the High Courts relating  to
         certain children may be noted without having to apply for leave  to
         appeal. The Bill also makes provision that certain appeals must  be
         considered only on the written arguments of the parties.


         Since all these amendments will have  an  impact  on  the  existing
         rules of court, the Rules Board for Courts  of  Law  will  have  to
         ensure that all rules in  respect  of  appeals  applicable  to  the
         Supreme Court of Appeal,  the  High  Courts  and  the  magistrates'
         courts are brought in line with the procedures contemplated in  the
         Bill. The provisions of the proposed new section 309B(3)(b) of  the
         Act may, for example, be highlighted. The relevant  section  allows
         for  an  accused  person  to  apply  orally  for  leave  to  appeal
         immediately after a magistrate has passed his or  her  decision  or
         order as a result of a conviction. During its deliberations on  the
         Bill the Committee found that Rule 67 of  the  Rules  of  Court  in
         terms of the Magistrates' Courts Act, 1944 (Act No.  32  of  1944),
         dealing with appeals under section 309B of the Act, does  not  make
         provision for the situation where an accused person applies  orally
         for leave to appeal, as contemplated in section 309B(3)(b)  of  the
         Act.


         Clause 7 of the Bill therefore places an obligation  on  the  Rules
         Board for Courts of Law to revise and, where necessary,  amend  all
         rules in respect of appeals applicable  to  the  Supreme  Court  of
         Appeal, the High Courts and  the  magistrates'  courts.  The  Rules
         Board must, within three months after the date of the  commencement
         of the Act, submit any draft  amendment  rules  to  Parliament  for
         approval.


         This resolution must immediately be brought  to  the  attention  of
         the Chairperson of the Rules Board for Courts of Law.
     Report to be considered.

3.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on the  Promotion  of  National  Unity  and  Reconciliation
     Amendment Bill [B 34 - 2003] (National Assembly -  sec  75),  dated  27
     August 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the subject of the Promotion  of  National  Unity
         and Reconciliation Amendment Bill [B 34 - 2003] (National  Assembly
         - sec 75), referred to it  and  classified  by  the  Joint  Tagging
         Mechanism as a section 75 Bill, endorses the classification of  the
         Bill and reports the Bill with amendments [B 34A - 2003].


         The Committee wishes to report further, as follows:


         (1)     During the Committee's deliberations on  the  Bill  it  was
              brought to the Committee's attention that the Final Report  of
              the Truth and Reconciliation Commission contains an  erroneous
              classification of a victim who is alive, as deceased.


         (2)     In light of the above, the Committee  recommends  that  the
              Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional   Development   be
              requested to correct the matter administratively, if possible,
              and if not, then to request him to direct  his  Department  to
              approach a High Court  with  an  application  to  correct  the
              erroneous classification as identified above.  As  the  person
              concerned is blameless, it is proposed that the cost  incurred
              in respect of the application to a High Court be borne by  the
              Department. The Committee further wishes to recommend that, if
              at a later stage any further substantial errors are identified
              in  the  Final  Report  of  the   Truth   and   Reconciliation
              Commission,  such  errors  should,  as  far  as  possible,  be
              corrected through the judicial process.


     Report to be considered.

     Petroleum Products Amendment Bill [B 25 - 2003]  (National  Assembly  -

         The Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy,  having  considered
         the subject of the Petroleum Products Amendment Bill [B 25 -  2003]
         (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it and classified by  the
         Joint  Tagging  Mechanism  as  a  section  75  Bill,  presents  the
         Petroleum Products Amendment Bill [B 25B - 2003].

5.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Health  on  the  National  Health
     Bill [B 32 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 76), dated 28 August 2003:

         as a section 76 Bill, reports the Bill with  amendments  [B  32A  -
         2003].

1.    The Speaker:


     Letter dated 5 August 2003 from the Minister of Health to the  Speaker,
     tabled in terms of section 65(2)(a) of the  Public  Finance  Management
     Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the delay in  the  tabling  of
     the Annual Reports and Financial Statements  for  the  National  Health
     Laboratory Services for 2001-2002 and 2002-2003.


     Dear Madam Speaker


     National Health Laboratory Services (NHLS):  Annual  Reports  2001-2002
     and 2002-2003.


     The purpose of this letter is to advise you that  the  National  Health
     Laboratory  Services  will  not  be  able  to  comply  with  the   PFMA
     Regulations in respect of the submission of the  abovementioned  Annual
     Reports to Parliament.


     The National Health Laboratory Services was  established  as  a  public
     entity on 1 October 2001 and used  the  budget  of  the  South  African
     Institute for Medical Research (SAIMR) for the first eighteen months of
     its existence.


     There was a delay in the appointment of external auditors, but  finally
     PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Gobodo have been appointed and commenced the
     audit for the 18-month period. This has been done with the  involvement
     of the office of the Auditor-General.


     The National Health Laboratory Services will  therefore  not  be  in  a
     position to present an annual report for 2001/02, but expects to submit
     one report for the 18-month period from 1  October  2001  to  31  March
     2003. The auditors have advised that they will only be able to  present
     the draft audit report to the National Health  Laboratory  Services  on
     the 15 September 2003. There is  insufficient  time  for  the  National
     Health Laboratory to submit  an  Annual  Report  to  the  Minister  and
     Parliament by the 30 September 2003.


     The Annual Report shall be submitted as soon as it becomes available.


     Kindly bring this to the attention of the Secretary to Parliament.


     Kind regards


     Dr M E Tshabalala-Msimang, MP
     Minister
