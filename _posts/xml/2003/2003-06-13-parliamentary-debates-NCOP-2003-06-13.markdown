                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met tevredenheid kennis neem van die verlaging van 150 basispunte  in
       die repokoers wat gister  deur  die  President  van  die  Reserwebank
       aangekondig is en  wat  'n  welkome  verligting  aan  miljoene  Suid-
       Afrikaanse verbruikers bring; en


  (2) verder  die  President  van  die  Reserwebank  aanmoedig  om  verdere

(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with satisfaction the reduction of 150 basis points in the repo
       rate that was announced yesterday by the Governor of the Reserve Bank
       and  that  brings  welcome  relief  to  millions  of  South   African
       consumers; and


  (2) furthermore urges the Governor of the Reserve Bank  to  give  serious
       consideration  to  and  implement  further  reductions  in  the  near
       future.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        RECENT DISCOVERY OF GASFIELD

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson, I move without notice:

   That the Council -


   (1)      rejoices at the discovery of gas offshore north of Saldanha  Bay
        this week by a US firm exploring off the South African coast;


   (2)      notes that the gasfield is estimated  to  have  reserves  of  13
        trillion cubic feet, which is about half of Britain's  total  North
        Sea gas reserves and is a considerably bigger find than  any  other
        off the South African coast;


   (3)      further notes that, according to the Forest Oil development plan
        for the next seven years, this will lead to  three  large  combined
        cycle gas turbine power stations, new gas-to-liquid fuel plants  at
        Saldanha Bay and hundreds of kilometres of  undersea  and  overland
        pipelines to convey gas to many towns for industrial purposes;


   (4)      expresses its joy at the fact that this will create thousands of
        jobs for our young unemployed matriculants and will  produce  clean
        burning fuel and more gas  for  industrial  and  heating  purposes,
        which will be better for our environment; and


   (5)      expresses the view that members of the Council should -


        (a)      take up their cudgels and ensure that our country does not
              fall prey to foreign investors who will eventually control our
              resources as the Firestone company controls the rubber of West
              Africa, and the oil of Nigeria and Ghana is now in  the  hands
              of investors from outside Africa; and


        (b)      ensure that labour-intensive methods are used  as  far  as
              possible to enable more men, women and young  people  to  earn
              their own living and have a stake  in  this  resource  of  our
              motherland.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               REFERRAL OF ORDER NO 4 AND ORDER NO 5 ON ORDER
                          PAPER TO SELECT COMMITTEE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the proposed Pan South African Language Board Amendment Bill and the
  proposed Promotion of Multilingualism Bill, as well as the reports of the
  Select  Committee  on  Members'  and  Provincial  Legislative   Proposals
  thereon, appearing on today's Order Paper as Order No 4 and Order  No  5,
  be referred to the  Select  Committee  on  Education  and  Recreation  in
  accordance with Rule 180(2)(b).

I am doing so on the basis that these items deal  with  a  private  member's
proposal  in  terms  of  Rule  179(3).  When  a  committee   considers   the
desirability of that proposal, and there is a possibility that it  may  have
financial implications for the state which might affect the decision on  the
desirability of that proposal, it  should  then  refer  the  matter  to  the
Chairperson of the Council, who would in  turn  refer  it  to  the  relevant
select committee. It is my submission that in the case of  Order  No  4  and
Order No 5 there was an inadvertent omission to do so, and consequently,  in
order to ensure compliance with Rule 179(3), I propose that  the  matter  be
referred to the Select Committee on Education and Recreation,  within  whose
ambit this proposal falls.

May I also mention  that  I  have  communicated  my  intention  to  all  the
provincial Whips and all the party Whips, as well  as  the  relevant  member
and the  Chairperson  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Private  Members'  and
Provincial Legislative Proposals concerned, and the view is  broadly  shared
that this is the correct procedure  to  adopt.  I  would  imagine  that  the
question would have to be put to the delegations of the different  provinces
in terms of section 65(1).

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, I should imagine it  would  have
the same effect, but the procedure in terms of section 65  would  mean  that
it would have to be referred to the  heads  of  the  delegations  from  each
province. So, in order to ensure compliance with  the  procedure,  I  assume
that this would be referred to the  heads  of  the  delegation  for  assent.
However, I imagine the effect is much the same.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Thank you  very  much.
I hope the heads of the delegation all agree that there is no  problem.  All
the heads of the delegations are here: Do you all agree, just for  the  sake
of the record? [Interjections.] I can see Mr Africa  also  agrees.  So,  the
motion is agreed to.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

        Policy debate on Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government:

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Chairperson  and  esteemed
members and delegates to the National Council of  Provinces,  yesterday  was
an important day in the lives of all those  who  are  intimately  associated
with  local  government  in  our  country.  Mayors,  councillors,  municipal
managers, traditional leaders and MECs from all corners of our  country,  as
well as  representatives  of  various  support  and  service  organisations,
assembled here  in  Cape  Town  to  witness  the  launch  of  the  Municipal
Performance Excellence Awards, also known as the Vuna Awards.

The initiative is the result of a collaborative effort, involving the  South
African Local Government  Association,  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government, the Development Bank of Southern Africa and  the  National
Productivity Institute. It is part of our strategic intent  to  cultivate  a
culture of performance and a continuous improvement in  the  performance  of
our municipalities.

The event not  only  introduced  yet  another  measure  to  complement  such
existing mechanisms for sharing best  practice,  as  the  knowledge  sharing
facilities and the  cities'  support  and  learning  network,  but  it  also
celebrated the growing maturity of the local government sphere.

Chairperson, within a period of under three years  since  its  inauguration,
the local government sphere has already established  its  credentials  as  a
significant player with respect to attending to  many  areas  of  government
priority. These include intervening to  alter  conditions  which  slow  down
productivity or deny us the possibility to attract  investments  that  would
stimulate local economies, create sources of locally generated  revenue  and
make it possible for our people to access welfare enhancing basic services.

In various parts of the country people are experiencing the emerging  system
of local government as a major causal factor in  the  improvement  of  their
quality of  life.  The  residents  of  Alexandra  Township,  Galeshewe,  the
traditional areas which are now formally part of  the  eThekwini  or  Durban
metropolitan municipality, are beneficiaries of the developmental impact  of
our new system of government.

The parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government
was exposed to some of these realities when it recently conducted a study
tour of 63 municipalities around the country. If the internal
administrative systems of many of our municipalities are beginning to
function with some modicum of efficiency, it is because some of our
councillors and managers are giving it their best shot. These are the men
and women who are producing best practices, which must be shared for the
benefit of those municipalities which are still battling to overcome the
lasting legacy of the system we have resolved to transform.

The absence of a functional and efficient local government sphere has, in
the past, acted as a limiting factor for national and provincial
governments to realise their developmental objectives, or to pursue their
policy goal of improving social welfare. This brings into bold relief the
necessity for bonds of cohesion between our three spheres of government.
Some of the national and provincial support instruments for local
government are already in place, for instance, steps have been taken to
augment the institutional capacity of 39 out of 47 district municipalities.
In those district municipalities we have established planning,
implementation, management and support centres, otherwise known as PIMS
centres. These centres will serve as a locus for ongoing capacity-building
at the level of municipalities.

As we said in the National Assembly yesterday, we shall soon be
establishing such centres in the remaining six district municipalities. The
Ministry and Department of Provincial and Local Government are working very
closely with all nine the provincial governments, and together with our 284
municipalities, conducted a comprehensive diagnostic assessment of the
functional relationship between our spheres of Government.

We conducted a series of conferences in the provinces, with representatives
of provincial and local governments sharing experiences about the way the
system is working in their respective areas. It became clear to us that one
of the areas which needs improving, is that of forging synergistic
connections between provincial growth and development strategies and
municipal integrated development plans.
Since the outcomes of the provincial government and development strategies
are simultaneously inputs for municipal IDPs and vice versa, it is also
important for us to ensure that both the provincial growth and development
strategies and IDPs are of the requisite quality. Thus, we have decided to
pay greater attention to the task of improving provincial and local
government's capacity for socioeconomic planning. In addition, IDPs are
meant to become increasingly central as instruments for intra-sphere
planning, budgeting and co-ordination.

Following the diagnostic study I referred to earlier, it became clear that
we need to make specific interventions in pursuit of the strategic goal of
stabilising our intergovermental system. A total of 15 interventions were
identified and these areas speak directly to the imperative of capacitating
governmental structures across all three spheres. Thus, what started as an
assessment of progress relating to local government, led us to adopt
measures which reverberate throughout the system. So, local government
transformation became a catalyst for fine-tuning and refining the entire
intergovernmental relations system.

As hon members and delegates know, municipalities are required to prepare
five-year IDPs with an associated financial plan. For their part, the
provincial and national governments express their priorities in three-year
Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks.

The absence of alignment in the budgeting and planning regimes means that
the system is not functioning as the cohesive unit it ought to be. The
Department of Provincial and Local Government, together with the National
Treasury is undertaking measures to correct this anomaly. This year
legislative steps are also being taken to improve the alignment between
provincial growth and development strategies and municipal IDPs.

Another important measure relates to the enactment of legislation on
municipal financial management. This, together with the new programme of
support to provinces, will seek to instil greater certainty and symmetry in
the support, monitoring and supervising regimes that affect provincial and
local governments.

In respect of intra-sphere co-ordination, the President's Co-ordinating
Council has succeeded in creating a measure of institutional discipline and
predictability. There may well be a need, however, for refinements in its
mode of operation. We also have Minmecs, which exist in both statutory and
nonstatutory forms. It is only in a few sectors, such as finance and
education, where these are statutory structures.

A similar pattern exists in the provinces where intergovernmental
structures have been established. These vary in purpose, composition and
modus operandi. All in all these structures lack a common set of rules and
protocols and are currently too fluid. Our strategic priority, therefore,
is to strengthen and increase certainty, stability and predictability in
our intergovernmental system.

One way in which we seek to strengthen the intergovernmental system, is
through the joint implementation of critical development programmes. Some
of these critical programmes, including the consolidated municipal
infrastructure programme, the water services programme, the Community-Based
Public Works Programme, the sports and recreation programme, the national
electrification programme and the urban transport fund.

Substantial increases have been made in the consolidated municipal
infrastructure programme between the 2003-04 and 2005-06 financial years
from over R2 billion to about R4 billion. And these increases demonstrate
the kind of investment Government will be making over the next few years.

Of particular importance this year, is the establishment of the municipal
infrastructure grant. An initial amount of R50 million has been allocated.
Government will seek to co-ordinate and integrate key capital and
infrastructure initiatives better. In the implementation, national,
provincial and local governments will be given distinctive, yet
complimentary, responsibilities.

The free basic services programme will also be intensified this year, with
the support of our key infrastructure programmes. In the current year
Government has set aside R1,1 billion for free basic services. This is set
to increase to R1,6 billion in the 2005-06 financial year. The integrated
sustainable rural development programme and the urban renewal programme
will continue to be the principal co-ordination instruments across
Government.

All the necessary core funding, basic planning and institutional systems
are in place across national, provincial and local government and
manifestations of positive impact already exist on the ground. We are also
happy to note that the parliamentary portfolio committee has identified the
urban renewal programme and rural development nodes as the next items on
the programme of their study tours. We hope that as was the case after
their tour of 63 municipalities, they will also share their insights with
us in order to help increase our capacity for servicing these nodal
municipalities.

Together with our strategic partners in the provinces and in
municipalities, we in the Ministry and Department of Provincial and Local
Government are feeling extremely bullish. We are thrilled by the tide which
is progressively turning in favour of a South Africa on which so many have
staked their lives - a  South Africa which guarantees all its citizens a
better life.

We hope, Chairperson and hon members, that we can continue to count on the
support of the members of this House for a contribution which will make
this tide irreversible. [Applause.]

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister and
hon MECs in this august House, the strides that we have made with our
system of local government would indeed evoke a sense of immense pride in
our founding fathers. For, when they declared their aspirations on 26 June
1955, under very trying conditions, detractors and the colonial oppressors
could not comprehend these aspirations.

As we gather here this morning and attend to the matter of governance, all
of us, the opposition included, are indeed declaring, once more, very
loudly and clearly, that the people shall govern. I am also sure that
several of us here in this august House will, in the course of making our
input, quote the Constitution and other pieces of legislation of the new
order. By so doing, we will associate ourselves with the Declaration of
Human Rights and the current national project of renewing the people's
contract for development.

We often find ourselves on the threshold of a very intricate value judgment
when we have to make an objective assessment of the strides that our local
government has made thus far. In the majority of cases we have stable and
progressive municipalities who are alive and on top of their
responsibilities. We have not only declared our commitment to attend to
rural communities, but we have also committed the necessary resources so
that the rural areas remain our major focus.

As regards developmental nodes, the integrated sustainable rural
development programme in particular, is a practical statement which
indicates that the focus is more on rural areas than on urban areas. We are
pleased to note the programmatic schedule designed by the Department of
Provincial and Local Government. We surely need to address the outcry about
the lack of involvement and delayed implementation caused by the lack of
clarity of the roles, fiscal commitments, co-ordination, timeframes and
seconding of the necessary personnel to these developmental nodes.

We sincerely hope that other departments and role-players will similarly
commit themselves to specific well co-ordinated and integrated programmes,
so that such projects proceed without further hindrance. We have said on
many occasions that people should be their own developers in the spirit of
reconstruction and development. The Integrated Sustainable Development
Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme offer these opportunities to our
communities once more.

Since the developmental nodes represent a drastic departure from normal
development as we know it, it becomes imperative that all available
opportunities are utilised for the long-term empowerment of our
communities, to learn hands-on about project management, business planning,
the tendering process and much more. The PIM-centres are doing sterling
work and should be encouraged to do more.

We believe that the relevant SETAS should be drawn in, in order to
formalise and possibly extend learning areas to sustain the communities,
long after the project has been finalised. Perhaps it is here that the
suggested community development workers will find their feet. No part of
the country, however, is being neglected in so far as development is
concerned. This is illustrated by the number of LED projects that are
assisting communities in implementing local development. The displays
outside this Chamber yesterday - and I think they are continuing today - by
entrepreneurs from across the length and breadth of this country, bear
testimony to the fact that, given the necessary support and resources,
communities can do it themselves.

Up there in the gallery there are also entrepreneurs from inter alia
Carolina, who came all the way from Mpumalanga to deliver their statement
of intent on the LED projects. Many thanks to the Ministry for making it
possible for our mayors, our councillors and all those entrepreneurs to be
with us this morning.

This House is, inter alia, charged with responsibilities in the realm of
intergovernmental relations. Surely we will not merely single out what we
would like to do and then not do it. Despite the fact that it is
uninteresting and we sometimes lack support, we still need to intervene
when necessary. By intervention we do not necessary mean intervention only
when there are problems. Surely our major focus is on section 154(1) of the
Constitution, which calls upon us, in this House, as the seat of provincial
government and local government in particular, to focus on prevention, so
that the issues relating to section 139 and section 100 seldom arise.

We are challenged, however, to have more interaction and more measures in
place. This is to ensure that, as is evident now, interventions in terms of
section 106 of the Municipal Systems Act are becoming more frequent. These
are not subject to timeframes. We are called upon to do so. Later this year
we will be dealing with intergovernmental relations and focus on these
areas. We should see to it that we do not tread on each other's toes. We
should not stand by idly and expect somebody to do our job for us, so that,
indeed, we know that we are interdependent and each sphere of government is
supporting the others.

During the intergovernmental forum briefing, we learned about certain
wastages that are taking place in municipalities. This is a situation that
demands the necessary attention from those municipalities. In one case it
was said that a municipality was losing up to 40% of its water due to
leakage and other wasteful management. We call upon these municipalities to
see to it that they indeed practise good governance. I am sure that the
municipality mentioned, is not the only one, since there are others who
have not as yet been singled out. Good governance means that the
utilisation of available resources is paramount in their actions.

We have also noted with concern the level of municipal debts in some of
these municipalities. This is not a good measure for our intergovernmental
relations. We call upon those departments that still owe money to the
municipalities to do the right thing and pay up. Perhaps, this is an issue
that we should take into account when we consider allocations to
departments and municipalities, so that we deal with the debts of each
department at national level.

We had the opportunity to visit the disaster management centre in Pretoria,
in order to familiarise ourselves with the readiness of that unit in the
Department of Provincial and Local Government. We are certain that the
department is ready to implement this piece of legislation when it comes
into effect. We have also noted that some of the provincial departments are
not yet up to scratch as far as their preparedness to implement this piece
of legislation is concerned. We also call upon them to do the necessary
work in this regard.

It is with some concern that we note that our major stakeholders in local
government, and indeed the only institution that has the privilege of
participating ... [Interjections.] We would like to see this organised
government being part of us. We know they are stretched thin in that they
have many responsibilities, but they should also see their constitutional
mandate in this regard.

Mr S L TSENOLI (Free State): Deputy Chairperson, this intervention will be
a brief one. I would like to link my remarks to the Minister's observation
that yesterday's launch of the Vuna Awards is a very significant step in
our overall transformation of local government. These awards not only
provide an additional incentive for all of us in local government to pool
our resources to make the biggest impact in improving the quality of life
of our people on the ground, but also provide resources to those
municipalities that win the awards, so that they are able to use them
creatively and innovatively to continue on their successful paths. And for
that reason we congratulate the Minister and the department on that
initiative.

There is an important shift taking place in our local government
transformation programme, and that shift has arisen as a result of the
progress which we are making in terms of our intergovernmental relations.
In this regard, in particular, I refer to the resources that go to
municipalities. Some of the resources that went through our provincial
departments of local government now go to the municipalities themselves,
because we have arrived at a situation where we have legal clarity and
policy certainty in respect of our local government transformation
programme, regarding which work was previously still in progress.

I referred during my speech in the debate on housing in this House, to the
reality that, as the National Minister of Finance has said, increasingly
more resources are becoming available to us, as the management of our
economy improves daily. So, in local government, I am referring
specifically to the increasingly large equitable share that is going to
municipalities. In the Free State, specifically, R94 million went to
municipalities in the previous financial year and this amount will increase
to about R117 million in this financial year.

This attests to the fact that our progressive and stable approach to
transformation is bearing fruits. I am referring to this shift because it
also relates to the decentralisation of powers and functions to the
municipalities, which are under consideration and which we have not rushed
through. For example, with the allocation of the powers and functions,
although temporary for now, we have been able to assist municipalities in
the interim to finalise their budgets. As we are speaking now some of them
have already finalised their budgets. The issue of the powers and functions
was central to them in deciding what resources they would need for the
spheres for which they were responsible. It has been a very important
process as far as I am concerned. I think that once we finalise this it
will ensure an additional improvement in the quality of service at
municipal level, by removing legal and policy uncertainty.

Our province is one of those that have been very successful in terms of the
provision of free basic water especially, with other services slowly coming
up as soon as clarity is arrived at. This is as a result of co-operative
relationships between ourselves and other departments in this regard and
providing municipalities with information and other support.

But there is a crucial point that I would like to raise here. Talking about
co-operation, the Minister's department and our provincial department held
specific meetings so that public servants in the provincial and national
departments were able to come together to identify common areas of co-
operation, and so that these departments could regularly be in touch with
each other and there was a learning programme on a regular basis. The
interventions that we make together in support of local government should
then be co-ordinated so that they will have a bigger impact. I hope that we
will continue to do that work.

The conferences that the Minister referred to were crucial in adding to
that co-operation and collaboration. The IDP is the key planning tool of
all of Government - and I emphasise all of Government. The Minister will be
glad to know that in February we held a meeting in our province between the
premier's office, our department and various national departments and
provincial departments, including local government, as well as consultants
who help municipalities with their IDPs, to discuss a variety of problems.
That meeting was critical, in that it helped clarify our different roles
and our different concerns about each other, in the process of the
formulation of IDPs.

The study tour of the National Assembly makes an observation about the
necessity for this, which the Minister also made in his imput here. It is
an area where we are already doing some work, and we have been able to
identify very important issues. But I would like to single out four
critical areas. Firstly, as a result of our work with some of our partners
in this area, specifically our partnership with Australia in local
government support, we have arrived at the need to simplify IDPs - and in
particular the process for their formulation. In order to reduce the
dependency of municipalities on consultants, we increased councillor and
community involvement in the integrated and development planning process as
such and this is crucial for us to consider.

Mostly, when it comes to community involvement in our province, we are
piloting community-based planning through our provincial capital. This is a
deepening of local community involvement and participation in defining
priorities but also in defining the allocation of resources in a deeper
manner than has possibly been the case up to now. We think that this
fulfils the requirements of the third overall objective of local
government, which is deepening democracy and local accountability.

The third important aspect of this alignment - and I have referred to this
- is that we are already working to align IDPs with the Free State
development plan. The Free State development plan has four strategic
objectives: People development, sustainable infrastructure, economic
development and job creation and good governance. At that February meeting
that I referred to the intention was to review what was contained in the
IDPs, the manner in which the provincial plan itself was reviewed and the
IDPs themselves to ensure this alignment. In other words, work is already
in progress to achieve exactly what we are talking about and we are very
excited about this.

But the other point I would like to make about IDPs is that we as a
department find it very destructive that, unless we do as we have done now
with housing and proactively provide support in the form of people who are
going to work with the municipalities to develop their sectoral plans, this
will not happen. We think that we are the province that has undertaken this
housing sectoral plan in a manner unlike any other province in the country.


It is instructive in the sense that we do not think that many of our
municipalities have the capacity to generate funds and work with their
national department on their own, without the sectoral departments
themselves taking the initiative to provide support to the municipalities.
In essence I think we need a more robust approach by provincial and
national departments, to work with municipalities to provide this five-year
sectoral plan with its annual components. When we speak about continuing
support, the initial outline of a plan needs to have been put in place, in
collaboration with the municipality. This will then facilitate the manner
in which we co-operate and co-ordinate. For us this has been very
important.

We do the same thing, for example, with disaster management. The gains we
are making in service delivery will be severely undermined if we do not do
the same with disaster management, linked to IDPs. To date we have started
work around the implementation of the Disaster Management Act, and many of
our districts have done tremendous work, with the support of the provincial
department, to have their development plans linked to the IDPs - and for us
that is crucial.

These are key aspects that are a challenge to us. At this stage, where we
are engaged in local government transformation, leadership is the most
important aspect as far as we are concerned. In what virtually amounts to a
two-and-a-half-year mid-term evaluation, we have come to the conclusion
that, increasingly, a passionate approach is what makes the difference in
this instance.

The successful municipalities are those that have leadership and are
cohesive, with very little, if any, conflict, with strong financial
management and self-reliance. Information communication technology is going
to be crucial, but only if we deal with the soft issues, the people issues,
the leadership issues and conflict resolution.

Mr M BHABHA (Mpumalanga): Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy
Minister, and hon members, I am quite certain that during the course of
this debate, a number of challenges will be raised, and rightly so. But in
doing so, Chairperson, there is a distinct possibility of the impression
being created that local government is not doing well. I therefore believe
that it is appropriate that I commence with a simple question: What indeed
is the prognosis?

From a political perspective, we see democracy slowly but surely being
entrenched. We see stability way beyond our expectation. We see the
development of a legal consistency and a predictability that is so
necessary in governance. We see an appreciation of the need and the
importance of accountability. We see the development of a corporate
identity in municipalities. In essence, what we are seeing is the
prevalence of law and order, and a growing appreciation of democracy from
those that govern and those that are governed. What we are not seeing,
Chairperson, is a state of anarchy. Instead, all the hallmarks of a
civilised democracy become increasingly prominent.

The Minister and the respective MECs of local government deal with an area
of governance, as opposed to the functions that our other MECs perform. The
strategies must be such that a balance is maintained between ensuring a
continuation of services on the one hand, and bringing services to those
that did not have them before, on the other. With regard to the former,
Chairperson, we can say, with a degree of confidence, that by and large the
infrastructure of municipalities remain intact.

To put it crudely, robots still work, we still have water in our taps, and
the garbage still gets collected. These are services that directly affect
the quality of life of a resident in a municipality. We can safely claim
that the fact that these services continue to be delivered at a quality
comparable to the best in the world, is no mean feat. Indeed, one only has
to walk downtown in central Johannesburg, or through Nelson Mandela Metro,
or even Alexandra Township, to feel a sense of pride, for having not only
maintained but also improved on what we found.

Chairperson, the provision of water poses one of the biggest challenges
facing municipalities. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry has
decided to transfer the water schemes that they are currently operating to
municipalities. There is a huge advantage in such a policy. For one, there
will be a greater degree of political accountability. However, the actual
implementation of the policy is a different matter. There are associated
cost implications and administrative details that need to be assessed and
addressed.

The challenge lies in ensuring that municipalities are in a position to
take over these schemes. The details of the operational costs and capacity
become extremely important. It is true that water is life. Politically and
morally it is essential that there is a continuity of services,
irrespective of the constitutional and administrative rearrangements that
may or may not take place.

In terms of separate agreements between municipalities and the Department
of Water Affairs and Forestry, the department will provide funds for
operational costs and technical expertise over the next three years.
Thereafter, the operational costs will be included in the equitable share.
We are particularly concerned about the state of the infrastructure and the
schemes, and the cost to repair them. What constitutes operational costs,
how costs are in fact calculated, and whether assistance should be limited
to operational costs, are all aspects which must be discussed. The transfer
of water schemes must be accompanied by a concomitant transfer of skills.
We reiterate that the continuity of the service must remain our priority.

It goes without saying that we have one of the most progressive and
sophisticated systems of local government. However, the success of our
efforts will depend largely on our ability to implement the new system. In
this regard I must highlight that we are facing two particularly vexing
challenges. A somewhat disturbing degree of haemorrhaging of capacity from
municipalities is taking place. The departure of skilled personnel is
attributable to, inter alia, in terms of the reaching of pensionable age
and better prospects elsewhere. With the departure of skilled personnel, we
lose corporate memory. The challenge is to retain that memory and fill that
vacuum immediately.

In small municipalities, where the core competency is small,  the  departure
of one person could  have  dire  consequences,  particularly  where  such  a
person is highly skilled. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact  that
it  is  extremely   difficult   to   attract   skilled   labour   to   small
municipalities. Often the salaries are not competitive,  and  a  small  town
does not have the attractions that would appeal to skilled people. In  order
to address this challenge, it is our  view  that  talent  will  have  to  be
nurtured locally.

We  must  hasten  to  add  that  the  Minister's  policy  and  strategy,  as
encapsulated in the Revenue  Enhancement  Programme,  to  address  precisely
this challenge, is very promising. The  creation  of  the  Local  Government
Academy would go a long way in taking up this challenge.

Again I must reiterate, Chairperson, that local government is an area of
governance, the development, policies and implementation of which, in every
department at national and provincial level, impacts on the affairs of
municipalities to varying degrees. We would go so far as to say that
without strong local government many of these policies would not even have
a chance of succeeding. It is in this context that the IDP of a
municipality must be viewed. Far too often municipalities are not even
consulted when projects from other spheres are implemented. This practice
has the potential of wreaking havoc with the finances and plans of a
municipality.

I must tell you, Chairperson, that we are pleased to be part of a very
innovative and practical strategy that has been initiated by the Nkangala
district municipality. They involved every provincial government
department, including the DG of the province, in the formulation of the
IDPs. With this process not only is there a buy-in from every department,
but it is also hoped that each department will respect that IDP, before it
implements a project in that municipality.

An interesting and very promising development is the establishment of what
we now call `munimecs', based on Minmecs. In terms of a Cabinet decision,
MECs will engage the political heads in every municipality and
intergovernmental forum on sectoral issues. The MEC of Health, for example,
will engage with chairpersons of health portfolios in municipalities to
discuss and address matters of health. Increasingly, the IDPs are also
beginning to inform the policies of provincial government. Slowly but
surely we are moving in the right direction. We can only be optimistic that
with improved levels of planning, there will be improved efficacy in the
use of our resources.

Incidentally, Chairperson, we have now moved away from the academic
question, as to whether the creation of district municipalities was
justified. Let me give you our view, Chairperson, and I think the Minister
will be very interested to know it. We find that district municipalities
are indispensable, particularly for proper co-ordination, regional support
and planning, which is precisely what they were created for.

I must say that all these arrangements, are, however, voluntary and
informal. With the huge investments made in IDPs, I would suggest that we
go a little further than the Minister has, and possibly introduce a
regulatory framework or even legislation to coerce - for lack of a better
word - provincial governments, at least to start to respect the IDPs in the
formulation of their policies.

Chairperson, in implementing the provisions of the various legislative
instruments promulgated since the passing of the Constitution, we are
suitably placed to observe the effects and efficacy of these provisions. It
is in this light that I believe that the functions contained in Schedules 4
and 5 of the Constitution need to be reviewed. I believe that some of these
functions are not properly placed, nor is there always consensus on the
definition of what a certain function entails.

Do we, for example, have a common understanding of what ``potable water''
means? Do we have a common understanding of what ``primary health'' means?
Is it viable, for example, to locate the library function at provincial
level, when it is being performed so well at municipal level? These are the
issues we need to address. Before there is any question of assignment of
functions, I think we should locate them correctly first, and this will
require amendment. But this is purely for the purposes of functionality.

Let me conclude, Chairperson, by congratulating the Minister and the Deputy
Minister on two things, namely their vision and, as part of that vision,
the appointment of the DG. I am sure my MECs will agree with me that there
is a genuine buzz and an excitement in the department with her at the helm.
I know that we have so many more challenges, but we are certainly doing
well. If we look back we have a lot to celebrate. With those words I thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, hon Minister, Deputy Minister, MECs and
colleagues, this sector is characterised by one phrase, namely, lack of
capacity.

There is a lack of capacity to bill people properly for the services they
receive. There is a lack of capacity to collect the moneys people owe for
the services they have received, and this, hon Minister, includes the
amount of R1,9 billion owed by central and provincial governments to local
governments.

There is also a lack of capacity in many municipalities to deliver on the
ANC's local government election promises and we are already on the eve of
the next election. People were appointed to senior positions, such as
municipal managers, who lacked the capacity to do their jobs. Nonetheless,
these people received astronomical salaries. In some cases their salaries
exceed the salary of our President. [Interjections.]

This lack of capacity also manifests itself in the fact that many local
governments are not even up to date in submitting their financial records
for auditing by the Auditor-General. Unqualified reports from the Auditor-
General are the exception rather than the norm. Training and capacity-
building are urgently needed, but provide only part of the solution.
Nepotism and jobs for pals must be actively discouraged.

In these circumstances the DA will not support this Vote. [Applause.]

Mr T K FOWLER (Gauteng): Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister Mufamadi,
Minister Botha, MECs, delegates to the NCOP, the historic mission of the
ANC is to implement the principles contained in the Freedom Charter. The
sum total of this mission is to undo the legacy of apartheid and transform
the state into a developmental state which can then effect socioeconomic
changes that result in a better life for all South Africans.

The key outcome which a developmental state strives to achieve is
sustainable development. In the words of Samir Amin, a radical thinker from
Egypt: ``The democratisation of the state is by definition an integral part
of a development process.'' It is this concept of development that has
guided the concept of legislation that informs the transformation of the
local government sphere.

I would, at this point, like to congratulate the hon the Minister and the
Deputy Minister on the success of the Vuna Awards yesterday, but also for
the detailed work that was undertaking in recent years and the results
which are so visible in the presentation that has been made today.

Comrade Deputy Chairperson, I must say, I do not know which country the hon
Lever lives in. It does not sound as if he lives in the one that I live in.
So I want to take him on a short journey through one of our provinces,
Gauteng, because it seems that he lives in a different country.
[Interjections.]

Last year we launched the Municipal Institutional Support Centre to provide
strategic support and to develop our municipalities. Treasury was included
in the interventions made and financial support given in this regard, and
municipalities such as Westonaria have markedly improved their collection
rate from 65% to 90%. The MISC has provided support and performance
management systems and municipalities are progressing well in implementing
this system. Training with regard to general accounting practice is also
being undertaken to prepare for the implementation of the Municipal Finance
Management Act.

The central task of a developmental state is to address poverty by means of
a multifaceted approach. The provision of quality basic services is central
to a developmental programme. We are striving to provide water and adequate
sanitation to all citizens in Gauteng by the year 2006 and have allocated
some R250 million out of our provincial budget over a period of four years
to this end. The programme also includes the eradication of the bucket
system by the end of 2004, as a key element in improving the health
conditions of our people.

All municipalities in Gauteng provide 6 000 litres of free basic water to
every low-income household. However, this has not been implemented
consistently within the province. There are several municipalities that
levy a basic charge to access it. Tswane is leading the way in effectively
implementing this programme.

We have urged municipalities to engage with farmers, where there is
difficulty in providing free basic services, because of private land, to
develop mechanisms for providing free basic services to farmworkers. The
municipality of Motgale City has extended the programme to incorporate farm
settlements.

A major challenge in respect of the provision of free basic electricity,
Comrade Minister, is the historical separation between the provision of
electricity to the erstwhile black local authorities by Eskom and the
remaining areas by municipalities. Comrade Chairperson, the length of time
the pilot programme by Eskom is taking has placed considerable pressure on
municipalities because of community expectations regarding free basic
electricity. The expectation that Eskom provides free basic electricity to
all qualifying households, must soon be fulfilled.

The Alex urban renewal node is progressing well. This includes the
completion of a people's centre, the greening of the banks of the Jukskei
River and housing that still has to be constructed. Our approach to
development and service delivery is people-centred and aimed at ensuring
sustainable communities. Ward committees play an important role as specific
vehicles to ensure community participation and that the needs of
communities are addressed.

Let me share with you an example of how a focused report for ward
committees can contribute to democratic governance. The community of
Zithubene in Ngygweni were dissatisfied, which resulted in tension and the
homes of councillors and municipal officials being set alight. Through the
assistance of the department and the province, the community and the
councillors engaged in a process that resulted in an inclusive ward
committee. Consequently the councillors and the community are together
addressing the service delivery challenges in Zithubene.

We are continuing to provide capacity-building support to ward committees
and councillors and community liaison officers. In March of this year 89
liaison officers and councillors from ten municipalities, including 900
ward committee members, were trained. As has been stated, community
development workers have made an immense contribution towards providing
that democratic link.

Preparations and consultations with municipalities are under way and we
plan to roll out the first pilot scheme of community development workers by
September this year. Accountability remains a key element of our democracy
and the programmes that we have implemented are aimed at dealing with
corruption and maladministration.

As you have so aptly said, Comrade Minister, the participation of
communities in IDPs is central and municipal IDPs form the basis of
planning for all spheres of government. The municipal IDPs have been
assessed to ensure compliance and alignment with national and provincial
programmes. In the last assessment received Municipal IDPs reflect that all
municipalities have taken up the challenge and have developed a vision for
the municipalities.

However, on the whole, IDPs have failed to provide a clear, overarching,
integrated strategy and planning process. A need for proper systems and
intergovernmental communication and improved alignment with municipalities
has also been identified. In order to facilitate greater integration, the
formulation of the Gauteng Integrated Development Plan or growth and
development strategy is in progress. The outcome of the assessment of
municipal IDPs will be incorporated in the GIDP, and the common strategies
and goals and objectives of the province and local government will also be
included.

Recently we passed the Gauteng Development and Planning Bill in the Gauteng
legislature which makes the Gauteng Integrated Development Plan a legal
instrument. It will include the 2014 process. Elements such as the Gauteng
spatial development framework have already been concluded. The Gauteng
Trade and Industrial Strategy has been concluded and is up for discussion,
and there is an infrastructure backlog study that has been concluded and
will be included in the IDP.

Sound intergovernmental relations are critical in providing effective
service in an integrated manner. In Gauteng, we have the Premier's Co-
ordinating Forum and the Gauteng Intergovernmental Forum. As hon members
are aware, in November last year we presented an assessment of the
municipal IDPs as well as the provincial strategy for the year 2003/04. At
the last meeting of our Premier's Co-ordinating Forum which took place last
month, we discussed the 15 interventions proposed by the President's Co-
ordinating Council and the conceptual framework of community development
workers.

Comrade Chairperson, in conclusion, organised local government should play
a central role in intergovernmental relations. Next week the Gauteng
Association of Local Authorities will hold its annual meeting, where it
will look at its capacity to improve its ability to contribute to
intergovernmental relations.

Ho a loka mona Gauteng le Aforica Borwa. Ke a leboha. [Mahofi.] [Everything
is going well in Gauteng and in South Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Deputy Chair, hon
Minister, hon MECs, hon delegates to the NCOP and hon members, when our
former President, Tat'uNelson Mandela made his maiden speech in this House
in 1997, he reminded members that the NCOP was set up as one of the core
institutions of co-operative governance. Indeed, we have witnessed and
experienced this over the past few years and commend the Council for the
excellent work it has been doing to ensure that there is greater co-
operation between national, provincial and local governments.

Our Ministry and department, as you know, is mandated to promote an
effective, efficient and integrated system of intergovernmental relations
between the three spheres of Government and the role that the Council has
played thus far has made our responsibility so much easier. We wish to
thank the NCOP for its leadership and support.

As we have moved into the consolidation phase of transformation, which is
2002-2005, during which period the systems and practices of developmental
local government will be consolidated into municipalities, we also have to
ensure stability, certainty and predictability in the system of
intergovernmental relations.

One of our department's priorities this year is to finalise the process of
drafting the national framework legislation for intergovernmental relations
in terms of the provisions of section 41 of our Constitution, and we hope
that the draft Bill will be submitted to Cabinet in the next few weeks.
This legislation should also provide for the appropriate mechanisms and
procedures to facilitate the settlement of intergovernmental disputes.
Coherent governance working collectively towards national objectives can
only be achieved through the co-operation of all three spheres of
Government.

For policies addressing development, poverty alleviation and service
delivery priorities to be implemented effectively, we would need an
approach which involves the three spheres of Government. Effective
implementation is predicated on effectively co-ordinating strategic plans.
Implementing common or joint development programmes on the local level is
not possible if the strategic plans of the participating spheres do not
speak to one another. It also creates difficulties when, for example, local
government initiatives as contained in the municipal IDPs are not matched
with the resource allocations of national or provincial government because
there is no alignment of the strategic objectives.

Our department has experienced this difficulty in some of the development
nodes we have been visiting recently. In the Western Cape, for example, we
are in the process of looking at the alignment of the local IDP priorities
and the provincial growth and development plan in both the Central Karoo
rural development node and the Khayelitsha and Mitchell's Plain urban
development nodes.

The department has recently made an assessment of the IDPs and interactions
with provinces in this process clearly indicated that an intergovernmental
planning policy may be necessary to outline the most suitable system and
mechanism through which alignment and co-ordination can be achieved with as
little resources and as little time as possible. However, it is heartening
to note that most provinces are making an effort to support municipalities
in setting up systems for service delivery and building capacity at the
local level.

The department has been given a role to co-ordinate and oversee the
implementation of both the Integrated Sustainable Rural Development
Programme and the Urban Renewal Programme. We have made significant
progress in getting increased involvement and commitment from all three
spheres of Government, as well as sector departments in the various nodes.
Over the past year and a half, with the support of the national, provincial
and local champions, we have seen the Urban Renewal Programme and the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme making a difference in
the lives of the communities.

We have embarked on a programme of visiting these nodes in order to assess
on a regular basis the progress being made and interact with people on the
ground through the medium of imbizo. In Motherwell, in the Eastern Cape
Province, there are plans for an integrated transport project that will not
only create 277 new jobs but will restructure the transport system serving
Motherwell in a manner that can be expanded in the future. In the same
node, they are progressing well with an urban agriculture project that has
the community involved in developing a ploughing field.

On a recent visit to the Central Karoo rural node, it was inspiring to see
how well Government's vision of tackling poverty was understood by
technical champions and experts from various Government departments such as
Social Development, Transport, and Environmental Affairs and Tourism, that
are working together to promote development in the region.

We are planning to visit the Inanda node and the KwaMashu node in KwaZulu-
Natal very soon. We have also been invited to visit the O R Tambo rural
node. We would like to commend provinces for supporting the districts and
local municipalities in these initiatives. The IDT has also played a
tremendous role in the rural nodes, acting as a programme implementation
agent. It is this type of partnership that characterises the work being
done by the IDT in the development of the nodes and we must commend them on
the work they are doing.

We recently received a report from the Portfolio Committee on Provincial
and Local Government which confirmed that most of the municipalities they
had visited had already established their ward committees. It is
encouraging to learn that a diverse range of civil society organisations
are actively involved in the ward committee structures, such as churches,
young people, women, business, taxi associations, community policing forums
and school governing bodies. Moretele Municipality in the North West
Province is one example of a municipality which has very vibrant ward
committees. The government of the North West Province has developed a
training manual for the training of members of ward committees. This will
go a long way towards assisting in the building of the capacity of those
ward committees and enabling them to participate in the processes at local
level. We must also commend the North West Province for the initiative they
have taken to support ward committees. They have undertaken to assist wards
committees by building small ward offices and providing them with basic
infrastructure.

We missed an opportunity of experiencing first-hand the NCOP initiative of
``Taking Parliament to the People'', when members visited the Taung and
Mafikeng areas in March this year. We wish to apologise for the
inconvenience our unintentional unavailability may have caused. It was due
to bad weather that the aircraft to Kimberley could not take off on that
particular day in time for us to be part of the proceedings. I thought we
should just explain this today.

We welcome the work being done by the NCOP with regard to the issue of the
institution of traditional leadership, and we have noted that this matter
will also be taken to the people during the NCOP's visits to the provinces.
I will assist the department a lot in the processes leading up to the
finalisation of the draft White Paper.
The local government sphere is an important site for the transformation of
South African society and for the effective delivery of services to local
communities. It therefore becomes important for all role-players at the
local level to participate equitably in the decision-making processes at
the various levels.

The Portfolio Committee on Provincial and Local Government, in its study
tour report, also refers to the inadequate representation of women in
senior management posts in the municipalities as well as in the ranks of
councillors. However, most importantly, we feel that more attention should
be given to addressing gender equality in our programmes of poverty
alleviation and the IDP process. We are still receiving reports which
indicate that in the provision of basic services, the municipalities do not
take into account the special needs of women. The department made an IDP
assessment study in April 2000 on poverty, gender and IDP, in South African
municipal practices. This report is available and may be very useful for
municipalities who are prepared to embark on this complex exercise of IDP
gender mainstreaming. And indeed, the special needs of children, young
people and people with disabilities need to be taken into account as well.

We would  like+  to  thank  the  members  of  the  Council  and  the  select
committee, in particular, for the tremendous work  they  have  done  through
their interventions in municipalities. We  would  also  like  to  thank  the
director-general, Ms Lindi Msengana-Ndlela and her  team  for  the  sterling
work they have done.  During  our  absence  they  have  been  able  to  keep
liaising and working with the NCOP.

We  also  want  to  thank  the  Ministry  staff  for  their   support;   the
parliamentary officers who have been keeping  us  informed  as  to  what  is
happening in the NCOP and our involvement in  the  NCOP.  We  also  wish  to
thank Salga, the Premiers, MECs, mayors, councillors, iinkosi  and  all  our
strategic partners who  have  supported  us  throughout  this  period.  Most
importantly, let me thank you, Minister, for your leadership,  guidance  and
support. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,
MECs, distinguished guests, hon members,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  first  of
all, I must apologise for my MEC not being able to be present today. I  will
be delivering his speech on his behalf.

The President of South Africa, Mr Thabo Mbeki, speaking at the Commonwealth
Local Government Forum, emphasised the need for countries to observe the
local government declaration that was adopted at the World Summit for
Sustainable Development in 2002. The declaration asserted, in part, that
there are four interconnected principles for local governments which need
to underpin and inform all efforts to combat poverty and build a just and
sustainable world.

We constantly need to be reminded, when we meet, that we have a new
democratic system of local government in place. We need to reiterate that
all our efforts at the department are committed to supporting
municipalities, by sparing no effort in facilitating a process for them to
become viable entities, committed to quality service provision and
efficient service delivery with the aim of improving the quality of life of
the people which they serve.

However, as we are aware, the process towards achieving this is not smooth
sailing, especially as municipalities rely on more than 90% of revenue
which they have to collect to make this a reality. Given the poverty and
unemployment levels in the province, the revenue raised from service
provision is less than 60% of what municipalities is rising alarmingly and
the outstanding debt of municipalities is rising alarmingly, making it very
difficult for municipalities to fulfil their developmental mandate. Service
provision debts owed to municipalities are in excess of R575 million,
making it very difficult for municipalities to fulfil their developmental
mandate. We would like to make a call to all residents of the Northern
Cape, the business sector and Government institutions to honour their debts
owed to municipalities.

Deputy Chair, we are looking forward to the enactment of the Municipal
Finance Management Bill which will assist municipalities in managing their
resources in an effective, efficient and economical fashion, emphasising
responsibility and accountability. Equally so, hon members, the enactment
of the Property Rates Bill will immensely increase the revenue base of
municipalities, affording them the necessary resources to give effect to
their developmental objectives. The above pieces of legislation will
enhance the capacity of more of our municipalities to implement the
national priority of free basic service provision to the poorest of the
poor in our province.

A survey which spans the spectrum of municipalities indicates that
currently 86% of municipalities are providing free basic services, which is
limited to water only to the targeted beneficiaries. The status of
municipal infrastructure which is either poorly maintained or inefficiently
managed and, in some cases, insufficient equitable share allocation
accounts for the remaining 14%. We are confident that the roll-out of the
electricity component of the free basic services programme by the
Department of Minerals and Energy will complete the full spectrum of the
provision of free basic services.

The department will continue to deliver on its mandate of monitoring and
facilitating the disaster readiness of the municipalities in compliance
with the newly enacted Disaster Management Act. In this financial year an
amount of R3 million has been made available to enable municipalities to
acquire some fire-fighting equipment. Volunteers will be recruited and
trained to utilise this particular equipment, which will improve the
reaction time to fire-related disasters.

As part of the requirements for the IDPs, municipalities are supposed to
have a performance management system in place, with key performance
indicators developed with the communities, as part of the performance
assessment of municipalities. The department has put processes in place to
ensure that performance management development systems for individuals at
municipal level are developed. This will enhance accountability and enable
municipalities to realise the key performance indicators set out in their
IDPs, as part of the overall transformation process at municipal level.

Another key programme in enhancing the viability of municipalities is the
Municipal Support Programme. In the 2002-03 financial year we targeted
eight municipalities at a total cost of R15,5 million. Those municipalities
have been given the necessary institutional and administrative capacity to
deliver on their developmental mandate. In this financial year the
following municipalities have been targeted for support under the Municipal
Support Programme: Mier, Magareng and Dikgatlong. The support to be
provided will include, amongst others, building strategic, administrative,
financial and human resource management capabilities and the funding of
income-generated projects to improve the revenue base of these
municipalities.

The following municipalities that were under the MSP in the last financial
year will again receive support to finalise the programme in terms of
financial capacity and human resource capacity: Tsantsabane, Emthanjeni,
Ubuntu and Siyathemba. This programme will be at a total cost of R15,1
million in this financial year.

The viability of municipalities is intricately linked to a vibrant local
economy. The rising costs of decent service provision, linked to the high
unemployment and poverty levels faced by scores of our people, put payment
of services beyond their reach, impacting negatively on the revenue base of
our already struggling municipalities. The contribution of the department
towards easing the problem of unemployment and providing much-needed jobs
is through the local economic development strategy for local government.

We have just completed a capacity-building programme for officials and
project steering committee members for all 19 projects currently funded
through this project in all districts. This programme is, in the main,
dealing with marketing, project management and promoting local ownership
for these projects to become viable and sustainable projects in the long
term. These projects have created 358 long-term projects and 287 short-term
job opportunities.

In the current financial year we have allocated R5,5 million to the
following new projects: Agri-business in the Emthanjeni municipality, a
peanut butter production plant in the Magareng municipality and the
development of a resort in the Hantam municipality ... [Time expired.]

Mr D E AFRICA (North West): Hon Chair of Chairs, hon Minister and Deputy
Minister, hom members of the NCOP, and my colleagues the MECs, we are
indeed living in interesting times for local government in South Africa.
Local government is critical in the consolidation of our democracy. We as
the North West, therefore, wish to welcome the Minister's Vote and
particularly its focus on free basic services and assistance to
municipalities.

We think that we have reached a stage in which our concentration must be in
the consolidation of the ward committees. It is our belief that ward
committees are an important instrument for the continued consolidation of
our system. We are particularly happy that a conference on ward committees
has been organised by the department and we believe that it will go a long
way in strengthening these essential instruments.

Ward committees, in our view, can create a platform for the participation
of our communities, but that platform can only be possible if ward
committees are appropriately capacitated. Without strong ward committees,
the consolidation phase of local government will be seriously undermined.

In the North West Province we are currently piloting a system to strengthen
ward committees by providing them with decent offices, computers and other
necessities. We believe that ward committees should not be seen as ad hoc
instruments, but should be consolidated even further to allow people the
opportunity to utilise them as instruments in which they can inform the
process of governance.

We are happy to inform this House that we are continuously reflecting on
the need to strengthen our interaction with municipalities through our
intergovernmental forum. We have realigned our intergovernmental forum so
that it can even inform processes at the PCC. Our intergovernmental forum
wishes to inform the House that it is functioning very well, and has even
innovatively created opportunities for traditional leaders to participate
in that forum, because it is our belief that stronger relationships with
traditional leaders will help in the provision of services to communities,
especially those under the jurisdiction of traditional leaders.

We are very concerned about certain national and provincial departments,
but national departments in particular, that are dealing with delegation or
agency agreements. We want to suggest that all current arrangements that
various departments have, should receive the attention of the Minister. We
believe that there is no greater focus on section 238 of the Constitution
in dealing with these matters. We also believe that all national
departments that are interacting with municipalities must be able to do so
within the context of that provision.

We are continuing to enjoy greater co-operation with traditional leaders in
our province. There is now a greater recognition among traditional leaders
in our province that an enduring partnership between municipalities and
traditional leaders is the only good thing to do to ensure that we are able
to work together as partners in providing sustainable services and
development to our communities. Traditional leaders in the province are
playing an active part in all activities of our province and they are also
demonstrating a desire to be part of the process of transformation and
change. As a demonstration of their commitment, many traditional leaders
are providing land for housing developments in many areas within the
province.

As part of our effort to build stronger municipalities which we believe are
essential to service delivery and the consolidation of our democratic
system, we have established a municipal leadership and training academy to
provide greater capacity to municipalities. We think that the leadership
that municipalities or councillors provide to our communities must be such
that we are able to inspire these communities to participate effectively.
Our effort in building this capacity through this municipal leadership
academy is an attempt by the province to consolidate and provide the
necessary assistance to local government so that it can play a critical
role in service delivery.

We are also happy that many of our municipalities have been able to
complete their IDPs and we have done an assessment as a province to assist
these municipalities so that the quality of these IDPs can be improved. We
are confident that many of the municipalities, through these IDPs, are now
going to orientate their provision of services properly and participate
effectively in providing services.

We have noted and made certain suggestions to municipalities about how best
they can improve the IDPs. We have suggested that there should be greater
alignment between planning and budgeting. We have also suggested the need
to improve disaster management plans within those IDPs, the need to improve
financial plans and spatial development plans within those IDPs, and that
they should also begin to focus more on environmental and waste management
issues.

We have suggested that municipalities do a comprehensive analysis of the
microeconomy at municipal level and how the microeconomy can fit into the
macroeconomy, and draw a link between local economic development and come
up with strategies that will ensure that municipalities play a key role in
tackling issues of poverty alleviation. We have also advised municipalities
to use the IDPs effectively to restructure the apartheid landscape, and
have also suggested to them that they need to do a proper profile of the
cost of providing services to all communities, given the distorted special
patterns that they have inherited.

We think that if the municipalities can incorporate these elements into the
IDPs then the exciting period I referred to will be even greater. The
excitement that people will experience in participating in and being part
of these municipalities will be enhanced.

There is no doubt that municipalities in our province, with all the
problems that we know they are experiencing at the moment, will begin to
provide a greater and greater service to the communities. We think that if
more and more assistance can be given and there can be more co-ordination
between national and provincial departments, we will be able to give more
help to municipalities.

We are very happy that the Kgalagadi Node has been selected as a Nepad
pilot. The Kgalagadi Node continues to inspire us, not only as a rural
node, but as an example of how integrated governance can be pursued. We are
happy that Kgalagadi, amongst the many nodes that exist, has been able to
show how it can integrate projects and programmes at local level allowing
municipalities themselves to lead.

What we appreciate even more, and what is also notable in the area, is the
participation of women, young people and traditional leaders in the node.
We think that, with greater assistance to this node, we will be able to
create better opportunities and change the situation in the rural areas.

We want to thank the Ministry, particularly the Minister and the Deputy
Minister, for their leadership and the department for the assistance they
are providing to our municipalities. As the North West Province, we are
happy because we have been informed that we will be used as a pilot for the
NEF (National Empowerment Fund) centres in terms of the implementation of
the IDPs and we appreciate ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mnr J HORNE: Agb Voorsitter, agb Minister en LUR's en lede van die Huis, ek
neem met graagte deel aan die debat oor plaaslike regering. Die begroting
as sodanig poog om plaaslike owerhede die nodige ondersteuning te gee, om
sodoende hul primêre funksies te verrig deur middel van dienslewering op
die grondvlak.

As 'n mens na die begroting in sy geheel kyk en jy sien hoe ver daar gegaan
word om munisipaliteite te ondersteun en te vestig, dan kom die vraag
onwillekeurig by jou op: Wat is die rede waarom soveel munisipaliteite met
rasse skrede sink, en dienslewering agteruitgang toon?

Die verantwoordelikheid van enige plaaslike owerheid is om basiese dienste
aan sy kiesers te lewer en altyd te poog om sy dienste op te gradeer. Baie
rade slaag egter nie daarin nie.

Met die afbakening wat in 2000 afgehandel is en die vermindering van
munisipaliteite van 834 tot 284 het dit nie juis verligting of verbetering
in die hand gewerk nie. Sommige bankrot munisipaliteite is bygevoeg by
ander wat finansieel gesond was, en die nadelige uitwerking daarvan is nou
sigbaar. Daar sal nou met hierdie werklikheid gehandel moet word.
Baie van die pasgestigte munisipaliteite vind dit moeilik om die
verskillende administrasies te konsolideer, asook die amptenare wat almal
voorheen verskillende werksbeskrywings gehad het. Almal word nou in een
organogram opgeneem.

'n Mens is dankbaar vir wat die nasionale en provinsiale regering, asook
die Nasionale Tesourie, doen. Tog bly baie van die munisipaliteite in
gebreke om voor die spertyd hul finansiële state op te stel en in te dien,
soos blyk uit die Ouditeur-Generaal se verslag. En waar konsultante
aangestel word, word daar nie toegesien dat iemand in diens opgelei word om
sodoende kapasiteit op te bou nie. Menige van die nuwe munisipaliteite het
ook nog nie hul verordeninge aangepas en in ooreenstemming gebring nie. So
is daar ook baie rade wat nog nie 'n krediet- en beheerbeleid in plek het
nie, en waar dit wel bestaan, word dit nie toegepas nie.

Die vermoë van verbruikers om vir hul dienste te betaal, is ook rede tot
kommer, daar dit in die meeste gevalle nie aan moedswilligheid toegeskryf
kan word nie, maar werkloosheid die oorsaak is. In sommige gevalle is 60%
van die verbruikers afhanklik van staatshulp om vir hul dienste te betaal,
wat beteken daar is nie 'n normale vloei van geld oor die toonbank van baie
munisipaliteite nie.

In die lig van genoemde feite, is dit baie duidelik dat ontwikkeling
sodoende gekortwiek word, en plaaslike owerhede sal in die nabye toekoms
geensins daaraan kan dink om eksterne lenings aan te gaan om sodoende
ontwikkeling te bevorder nie. Daar sal na ander maniere gekyk moet word om
projekte van die grond te kry, soos munisipaliteite wat sal moet kontak
maak met die Departement van Openbare Werke vir finansiering, vir die
opgradering van strate, asook met die Departement van Waterwese vir water-
en sanitasieprojekte.

Ten slotte, agb Voorsitter, sal daar ook gekyk moet word na die
salariskomponent binne die munisipale begroting, anders sit ons later met
'n paneel van hoogs betaalde amptenare, terwyl die plaaslike owerhede moet
spook om kop bo water te hou.

Ten slotte, Voorsitter, baie dankie aan die direkteur-generaal met haar
personeel wat die gekose komitee deur hierdie begroting gelei het. Ek dink
elke lid van hierdie gekose komitee verstaan die begroting en dat hierdie
begroting daarop gemik is om munisipaliteite te vestig en te orden.

Die Nuwe NP steun die begrotingspos. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and MECs and members of the
House, I take pleasure in participating in the debate on local government.
The budget as such endeavours to give local authorities the necessary
support so that they can perform their primary functions by means of
service delivery at grass-roots level.

If one looks at the budget as a whole and one sees how much is being done
to support and establish municipalities, one asks oneself involuntarily:
Why are so many municipalities going under so rapidly and why is service
delivery deteriorating?

It is the responsibility of any local authority to deliver basic services
to its voters and always to try to upgrade its services. However, many
councils are not succeeding in doing this.

The demarcation which was completed in 2000 and the decrease in the number
of municipalities from 834 to 284 did not really bring relief or
improvement. Some bankrupt municipalities were incorporated into others
which were financially sound, and the negative effect of that is visible
now. This reality will now have to be dealt with.

Many of the newly established municipalities are finding it difficult to
consolidate the various administrations, as well as the officials all of
whom had different job descriptions in the past. All of them are now being
included in one organogram.

One is grateful for what the national and provincial governments, as well
as the National Treasury, are doing. Yet many of the municipalities are
failing to compile and submit their financial statements before the
deadline, as is evident from the Auditor-General's report. And when
consultants are appointed it is not ensured that someone receives in-
service training in order to build up capacity. Many of the new
municipalities have also not yet adapted their by-laws and brought them in
line. Similarly, there are also many councils which do not yet have a
credit and control policy in place, and where such a policy does in fact
exist, it is not being implemented.

The ability of consumers to pay for their services is also a cause for
concern, since in most cases non-payment cannot be attributed to
stubbornness, but is caused by unemployment. In some cases 60% of the
consumers are dependent on state aid to pay for their services, which means
that there is not a normal flow of money over the counter of many
municipalities.

In view of the abovementioned facts it is quite clear that development is
being obstructed by this, and in the near future local authorities will in
no way be able to consider making external loans in order to promote
development. Other ways of getting projects off the ground, will have to be
considered, such as municipalities contacting the Department of Public
Works for funding for the upgrading of streets, and the Department of Water
Affairs for water and sanitation projects.

In conclusion, hon Chairperson, the salary component within the municipal
budget will also have to be examined, otherwise we will eventually be stuck
with a panel of highly paid officials, while the local authorities have to
struggle to keep their heads above the water.

In conclusion, Chairperson, thank you to the director-general and her staff
who led the select committee through this budget. I think every member of
this select committee understands the budget and that this budget is aimed
at establishing and regulating municipalities.

The New NP supports the Vote. [Applause.]]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, let me start off by expressing sincere
thanks to all our mayors and councillors for their hard work and for the
good work they are doing in our communities under trying conditions. We are
all aware that some of the areas in which they are supposed to serve us are
very fragmented and not properly demarcated. In some areas they had to
start from scratch. In other words, there were no services. Keep on: ``lena
bana ba Thulare'' [You children of Thulare]. It is just like a fly that
cannot quite reach the height of a great person but has to toil and toil
like a proverbial miner, while his companions are still asleep.

Chairperson, I want to touch on the activities of our demarcation board.
This is the body that was tasked to consolidate our areas into manageable
and sizable municipalities. As one can imagine, that was not going to be an
easy task. But, nevertheless, I want to congratulate and thank the
Demarcation Board for what they have done which, to some of us, was a
miracle. However, there are some areas where one can see that not much
research was done before demarcating those areas. Hence, there are some
areas that, in my view, need to be redemarcated or revisited.

The problem with some of our officials in some departments is that they
like to take arm-chair decisions. In most cases when that happens there are
likely to be some ill-considered decisions. I want to give only one
example. In Bohlabela, one of the municipalities in Limpopo, there are some
villages in ward 25 which are linked to ward 28, which is no less than 50
kilometres away from that ward. Some villages in ward 28, in the very same
municipality, are linked to ward 25. That proves that some people did not
do much research when taking those decisions.

As public representatives who are responsible, we took the matter up with
the Demarcation Board and they promised to rectify that mistake. That was
in the year 2000. I am addressing this matter because as you know,
Chairperson, in our wards or municipalities, as was rightly stated by the
hon Darkie Africa, the MEC from North West, for councillors to be effective
and to be seen to be working, they need the assistance of ward committees
and community development forums. The people I am mentioning are volunteers
and they are not getting any incentives. To travel those distances, trying
to cover villages that have erroneously been linked to other wards, is
difficult and inconvenient.

The unfortunate thing is that the last time we heard from the Demarcation
Board was in that same year - the year 2000. I want to believe, and I am
hopeful, that they are possibly in the process of drafting a letter to
respond to those requests. I know the Minister will say something about
this. [Laughter.]

I know there are many areas with similar problems. I want to humbly propose
to my Minister and my Deputy Minister: Could we task the Demarcation Board
to sit down and revisit and re-examine some of these areas? There might not
be many of them, but that will go a long way in ensuring that service
delivery is effective.

(Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Now I am switching to Thobela FM, so you should switch on the listening
devices. The hon the Minister understands, because he is from the North.
The committee visited the Disaster Management Centre in Mamelodi, Pretoria.
The officials of his department work very hard and with great skill. We are
satisfied with the way they work. The problem is that this department does
not get an adequate budget. Think how they worked during the trying times
of heavy rains and when strong winds destroyed buildings and houses. They
do the work on a tight budget as there is not enough money. Come to their
rescue, hon Minister, you can see that the department is working hard - if
there are fires anywhere, they help.

I want to talk a bit about Salga. Hon Minister, I feel that these gentlemen
are failing. [Laughter.] The way they relate to this House is not
satisfactory. The platform that we have given them to work hand in hand
with us is not being utilised. We ask permission for the House to empower
them to enable them to work with us, because we need them. There are things
that we cannot do without them. If they do not come to us, we do not know
what is happening and what their problems are. It is not right that we do
not know what their concerns are when we visit the provinces. We thank them
heartily for coming. And again, when we debate what we call Bills in
English ...

Let me speed up my presentation as there is not enough time - they have
heard me. I hope that the hon the Minister will act, because if we do not
do that we will be like those people who ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr G B BHENGU (KwaZulu-Natal): Chairperson, hon Minister, hon Deputy
Minister, hon MECs and colleagues, local government is a cornerstone of our
democracy and the latest legislation has elevated it to a cornerstone of
service and delivery in our country. The foundations upon which proper
efficient delivery must be undertaken are accountable and sustainable
traditional institutions, local governance, as well as sound corporate
management.

Transformation of departmental administrative support systems is of vital
importance for the enhancement of institutional performance capacity.
However, uncertainty regarding the allocation of municipalities' equitable
share to the different categories of municipalities, as well as the lack of
capacity-building on the part of staff, are serious impediments to service
and delivery. I am happy, because I have heard from the Minister that they
are aware of and are addressing these issues.

Legislation such as the Communal Land Rights Bill has the potential to put
serious obstacles in the way of the present effort to implement the
Integrated Development Plan in our country, especially in the rural areas,
where the vast majority of the poorest of the poor live. The IDPs are
instrumental in the transformatory process, hence an enormous capacity-
building programme is needed, especially in rural and semirural
municipalities.

The responsibility to deliver housing, water and so on, is very crucial for
the creation of jobs. To deliver and meet the basic needs of our people,
there must be solid growth and development planning among all levels in the
local government hierarchy. We need to expand our rural community
programmes at all levels by enhancing the skills and capacity of amakhosi
and izinduna, thus creating more service delivery and access points. There
cannot be solid progressive service and delivery in the rural areas without
their active participation and leadership.

We need a solid assessment and evaluation of criteria in terms of the
proposed implementation of the allocation of powers and functions to local
government. We need to aggressively develop infrastructure, alleviate
poverty and create more sustainable jobs. We must focus on the proper and
solid implementation of the existing plans. Above all, we need to seriously
re-examine the remuneration packages of municipal managers as this is a
serious impediment to the development of service and delivery. The huge
salaries of these officials burden the budget of small and rural
municipalities in particular. Despite the guidelines issued to
municipalities, there must be some regulation of the enormous personnel
cost.

Municipalities cannot sustain themselves. However, how long are we going to
allow municipalities to ignore the existing guidelines? Local government,
as I have said, is the root of democracy and growth. We must nurture and
cherish it. I commend the Minister for the efforts put into the development
of local government and we cannot continue to chide the local authorities
as we know they are still in their infant stage, and they are supposed to
be helped by this House through the various provinces, as they perform
their oversight function. [Applause.]

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, let me first start by tendering the apology of
the hon J Maswanganyi, the MEC for Local Government and Housing from
Limpopo, who could not be here today. Hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister,
hon MECs present and my colleagues, the local sphere of government has
undergone many phases of change since the advent of a democratic
dispensation in 1994.

In the Limpopo Province the transformation process has brought into
existence 32 municipalities, six of which are district municipalities. Of
significance is the fact that the process has brought into existence and
introduced four new districts and 12 new local municipalities that did not
exist before. In this final phase of structural and systematic
transformation of local governance, the mandate to capacitate and monitor
the local sphere of government becomes more acute and elaborate. This
requires the charting of strategies and a sustained effort towards
optimising the performance of local government structures.

Therefore, it is an achievement that we have operational administration
systems in all our municipalities. Our municipalities have all adopted
their IDPs that are the basis for all projects and developmental
initiatives that would take place in the municipalities. Of the 27
municipalities in which the Department of Provincial and Local Government
is piloting the performance management system, three are in the Limpopo
Province, namely the Tzaneen, Musina and Waterberg Municipalities.

While this is the case, our municipalities are also receiving elementary
training on the performance management system to prepare them for the roll-
out of the programme. As a result of the department's strategy for the
devolution of powers from both national and provincial departments to local
municipalities, currently in our province the Departments of Health and
Welfare and of Transport are engaged in the roll-out of the devolution
process.

Our country is confronted with the challenge of recovering the cost of
municipal services from consumers. During this financial year, Limpopo
Province will embark on a comprehensive debt recovery campaign in all
municipalities in general, with a specific pilot campaign being targeted in
six municipalities, namely Mogalakwena, Thulamela, Tubatse, Bushbuckridge,
Lepelle-Nkumbi and Greater Letaba.

Limpopo has a total of 1 238 councillors, of whom 313 are women. We have
entered into an arrangement with institutions such as the University of
Venda and the University of the North to design educational programmes
targeted at especially the youth and women councillors. We also have a
partnership with the women's foundation to train women councillors. These
efforts are aimed at cultivating sustainability and relevant capacity
required to enable them to effectively and meaningfully carry out their
social and economic tasks and responsibilities in their quest to push back
the frontiers of poverty.

The provision of free basic services remains a big challenge that is
receiving ongoing attention and maximum effort. The nature of our province
does not allow for the immediate blanket realisation of the above-mentioned
policy. The relationship between traditional leaders and municipal
structures has improved quite significantly, and their participation has
increased.

Another factor in respect of the Limpopo Province is that our communities
sometimes experience very turbulent times, in which disasters of one kind
or another are the defining features of their lives. These unfortunate
catastrophies require of us to develop strong capacity to ameliorate the
distress in which victims often find themselves.

In this regard, the Limpopo Province has constructed a provincial disaster
management centre to the value of R4 million. The Capricorn District
Municipality has established its own centre at the Polokwane Fire Station.
The latter centre will extend support to the municipalities found in the
district, until the local municipalities develop capacity of their own.
Road shows were undertaken to assess the status and capacity of
municipalities to respond to fire disasters. We noted the need for the
training of personnel in first aid and provisioning of infrastructure.

Lastly, the thrust of this budget is to further turn the tide towards a
better life for our people. As the end of ten years of freedom draws
closer, we can proudly proclaim that our Government does care for all our
people. Our social and economic progress demonstrates that fact.
[Applause.]

Mr G NKWINTI (Eastern Cape): Chair of Chairs, I wish to join my colleagues
in commending the Department of Provincial and Local Government for the
clarity of leadership that it is providing us as provinces. It is a very
cordial relationship that we are enjoying with the department, both at
political and administrative level.

Clearly, Chairperson, we have good reason to believe that synergies are
beginning to emerge in terms of clarification, with regard to how the
vertical relationships in terms of performing our mandates are actually
structured, and are going to be implemented. We commend the department for
that. Both the Minister and the Deputy Minister have been very prominent in
leading in this regard.

I will deal only with a couple of these themes here. I will deal with human
resources, initiatives to enforce good governance, guidance, support,
monitoring of municipalities, progress with regard to the provision of free
basic services, progress in the definition of roles and functions of
traditional leaders, LED projects, and in so far as that will be necessary,
of course we will deal also with the state of readiness and challenges in
implementing the Disaster Management Act. We will raise some of these
challenges where necessary.
With regard to human resources we are, in partnership with the Department
of Provincial and Local Government and Salga, engaging in the training of
councillors in financial management. This programme is proceeding very
well. With regard to municipal officials, a needs analysis for all
municipalities in the province has been conducted. The services of
recognised tertiary institutions, like the University of Fort Hare and the
University of Transkei and the Port Elizabeth Technikon, have been
contracted to provide training for municipal officials to enable them to
gain the necessary skills and qualifications to perform their functions
effectively. This programme will get under way soon, and funding has
already been transferred to these institutions.

We are also initiating a process of seminars on legislative frameworks for
councillors, municipal officials and community structures, focusing mainly
on ward committees which continue to be our Achilles heel. This exercise
seeks to clarify the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder.

With regard to the initiatives to encourage good governance in
municipalities and improve the efficiency of public services, especially
local government - the department is conducting walk-through audits, what
we call walk-through compliance audits in all municipalities. This
initiative is an attempt to determine the level of support that
municipalities need to ensure that they comply with all the latest
legislative prescriptions. The walk-through audit covers the following
areas: governance, administration, financial management, service delivery
and human resources.

We are convinced that this is the right thing to do. Experiences so far in
terms of what we have done and gone through with municipalities is that it
provides councillors, in particular, with a platform for them to be able to
better understand, and learn the functioning of their municipalities,
particularly at the administrative level.

With regard to guidance to, support for and monitoring of municipalities,
since last year the department has embarked on the annual performance
assessment of municipalities. A conference will be held in October this
year, and municipalities will be assessed on improved and co-ordinated
service delivery. This year has been declared the year of service delivery
for our municipalities. The best performing municipalities will be
rewarded. All municipalities will be supported in developing performance
management systems by 30 September 2003. Achieving this will practicalise
the monitoring and evaluation of municipalities.

A preparatory conference was held on 19 and 20 May 2003 to facilitate co-
ordinated service delivery in the province, and to align the IDPs, the
integrated sustainable rural development programme and the urban renewal
programme. And this was explored in detail. It is true that provincial
departments are not participating in the formulation of IDPs, and this is a
matter which is receiving very serious attention.

With regard to the Urban Renewal Programme, the department has budgeted R30
million this year for the three nodes, that is Motherwell, Mdantsane and
Ngangelizwe. And there we have already secured an amount of R3 million from
the Department of Housing for feasibility studies for each of the three
nodes. We are intending to engage in a major infrastructural development in
the three nodes.

Progress with regard to the provision of free basic services to the
communities, and the impact of the restructuring of electricity on free
basic services, has been slow. Now that powers and functions have been
finalised, municipalities will make visible progress. The provision of free
basic services is also being provided for in the municipal budgets for
2003/04. The provincial department is working with the national department
on the roadshows on free basic services.

With regard to progress in the definition of the roles and functions of
traditional leadership and institutions, of course we have a standing
conference with three standing commissions. Commission 1 is restoring the
dignity and integrity of traditional institutions and leadership.
Commission 2 is resourcing traditional institutions and leadership.
Commission 3 is integrating traditional institutions and leadership into
the democracy. These committees are composed of councillors and traditional
leaders. I am pleased to announce that some traditional leaders are
beginning to join municipal councils. These will soon be gazetted.

The challenge that is emerging now is subsistence and travel expenses to
council meetings. We have been faced with a big question. One chief said:
"I live in Malodi. I must attend a meeting in Mount Fletcher or Herschel,
and my neighbour here who is a councillor is compensated for subsistence
and travel expenses. I am not. I must pay my own way using my family's
resources. This is something that needs to be looked into." We are involved
in discussions with municipalities on this. Municipalities and ourselves
are agreed that we need to focus very carefully on this, and that
municipalities should also examine their budgets to ensure that we are not
involved in unfairly discriminating against traditional leaders, and also
that we are not inadvertently undermining the objective of Government to
integrate traditional institutions into the democracy.

With regard to LED projects, there are successes and challenges. The
highlights are: institutional arrangements are in place, there is a
provincial co-ordination committee, and provincial approval committees are
in existence and functioning well. There are sustainable projects with
success stories - a bakery, cultural centres, tourist trails and so forth.
A number of jobs have been created in 20 projects out of 48, valued at R30
million - 248 permanent jobs, and 1 295 temporary or seasonal jobs. Of the
jobs created, 60% are held by women, 40% by young people and 20% by
disabled people. Projects are linked to tourism strategy and other
programmes. Marketing strategies are in place for most projects, that is:
contracts are secured, strategic financial positions and making a profit in
some of these projects; community involvement, particularly young people,
and most of them women. Of course the intervention fund, the support that
we are getting from the Department of Provincial and Local Government, is
unbelievable in this regard.

At the programme level, we have challenges in respect of capacity,
particularly at provincial level where equipment, transport, monitoring and
evaluation are weak. At local government level the challenge pertains to
the transformation of local authorities and unpopulated organograms. In
other words there are no LED units in the sense of having a dedicated unit
that deals with LED projects. Individuals are dealing with LED projects,
and yet local economic development is the major responsibility of local
government.

My colleague, the hon Barbara said something about communication and
relations between the three spheres, and I am in agreement with him. We
think that we need to strengthen the policies around the LED, local
economic development and I am convinced that considering the way in which
the department is operating right now, this matter is going to be resolved
quickly. The monthly reports and provincial statements are also very weak.
Because we are not just municipalities alone, but form a province as well.
[Time expired. [Applause.]

Mr J J DOWRY (Western Cape): Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister Mufamadi and
Deputy Minister Botha, MECs and hon members, may I congratulate the
Minister, first of all, on his excellent speech yesterday in the NA, as
well as this morning in this august House, and especially on the very
impressive launch of the Vuna Awards yesterday in Cape Town. And I want to
add the name of the director-general to this, for the very big role she
played in this launch.

Let me start, Mr Minister, by giving you the assurance in this House that
local government in the Western Cape is on a sound and solid footing. The
last couple of months have seen the system of full-time councillors being
implemented, and we are currently implementing the system of executive
mayors and ward committees. By the end of this month most of the
municipalities will have implemented this new dispensation. This is a
practical step in the envisaged process of transformation of local
government, putting us firmly in the consolidation phase where
municipalities would aim to comply with Government policies and
legislation, setting up effective budgeting processes and service delivery
as well as monitoring mechanisms.

In the Western Cape, however, it was quickly realised that the process of
transition in local government would be a far more complex and difficult
exercise than was initially anticipated. We are also well aware that this
was a tiring time for the councillors, officials and communities involved
in the process, and different municipalities experienced the changes that
were brought about by transition with different levels of intensity.

As part of the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of municipal service
delivery, the department evaluates the progress municipalities in the
Western Cape are making with the finalisation of key transitional
activities by means of quarterly questionnaires. I am pleased to confirm
that the most recent data retrieved from the quarterly Transition Grant
Progress and Expenditure Reports showed that only eight of the
municipalities outside the metropole in the Western Cape experienced
progress below 70% with the finalisation of key transitional activities.
Only two of these eight municipalities were measured on a percentage below
60%. This means that more than 70% of the prescribed actions that were
required by the new legislation in terms of transition or establishment
after amalgamation have been finalised.

The good progress made by the municipalities in this regard can be
attributed to the support rendered by our department and assistance
provided through the Local Government Support Grant by means of the
Management Support Programme to finalise key activities. The most common
outstanding issues are the finalisation of the organogram and the placement
of staff. Unfortunately this has a negative effect on staff morale and
their performance.

Section 154(1) of the Constitution places an obligation on National and
Provincial Government, by legislative and other means, to monitor, support
and strengthen the capacity of municipalities to manage their own affairs,
to exercise their powers and to perform their functions. With this in mind
I need to raise a few concerns.

In considering the provincial obligation vis-á-vis municipalities the
general notion is to reduce it to a monitoring and supporting role with
only a reactive focus. The fact that provinces also have a co-ordinating
and regulatory role appears to be downplayed. To my mind there is a
definite proactive role to play, especially with regard to regional
planning and development, and I am convinced that a purely reactive role
will be counterproductive.

The Department of Local Government in the Western Cape sees its role as
being much more active, and, within the context of being the champion for
municipalities within the provincial jurisdiction, in the way that we are
proactive, value-adding, serious about our constitutional obligations to
monitor, support, regulate and co-ordinate, striking partnerships and
taking co-responsibility with municipal partners for our vision for
successful municipalities.

I want to highlight two specific areas in which we have been enabled to
play that role very effectively, namely the Consolidated Municipal
Infrastructure Programme and the Management Support Programme. Both these
programmes are funded by the national department, but with a definite and
proper value-adding role by the province. We have been able to proactively
influence infrastructure provision as a basis for optimal development, and
ensure that capacity gaps are taken into consideration. Over R500 million
has been disbursed through the Consolidated Municipal Infrastructure
Programme with very positive results.

With the Management Support Programme we have likewise been able to
proactively influence the way in which municipalities function in order to
avoid problems, and to rectify deficiencies before they get out of hand.
This could be done because we could back up our monitoring role with the
ability to fund remedies.

Alhoewel groot suksesse behaal is in die Wes-Kaap met die implementering
van bestuursondersteuningsprogramme, soos reeds na verwys is, is die fondse
waarmee dit gefinansier word net beskikbaar tot die boekjaar 2004-05.
Daarna word dit direk via die distriksmunisipaliteite gekanaliseer as deel
van een groot kapasiteitsboutoekenning, en verloor die provinsie nie net
hierdie belangrike fondse nie, maar sy rol in hierdie verband word ook
misken. In hierdie stadium lyk die kanse ook maar skraal dat eie
provinsiale fondse vir hierdie doel beskikbaar gaan wees om munisipaliteite
te steun, sou 'n finansiële krisis hulle in die gesig staar. (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Although great successes have been achieved in the Western Cape with the
implementation of management support programmes, as has been mentioned, the
funds with which this is being financed are only available until the 2004-
05 financial year. After that they will be channelled directly via the
district municipalities as part of one large capacity-building allocation,
and then not only will the province lose these important funds, but its
role in this connection will also be disregarded. At this stage it also
looks as if there is little chance that own provincial funds will be
available for this purpose to support municipalities if they were to face a
financial crisis.]

In both these cases the proposed changes to the institutional structure for
the disbursing of these funds indicate that provinces will be sidelined,
and merely become monitoring agents which may be blamed after the event.

The supposed benefit of these changes will be to bring predictability into
the intergovernmental fiscal regime, but my plea today is that because
serious capacity gaps in the sphere of local government are still being
experienced and must be taken into account when we make changes to
programmes which have been functioning with great success in the Western
Cape, we should reconsider the institutional and fiscal arrangements around
these new grant systems in order to build on the success that we have
achieved up to now.

Furthermore, the co-ordinating and facilitating role of provinces to ensure
proper integrated planning and development must be taken into account. In
this regard the value which can be added by the optimal involvement of
provinces in national funding programmes, combining it with the oversight
role, must not be underestimated.

In other words, these programmes are working and functioning in the Western
Cape. Please do not change it. My advice would be not to tamper with the
programme, especially in the Western Cape, where it is delivering excellent
results.

Chairperson, the Disaster Management Act, which provides for a
comprehensive, integrated and effective approach to disaster management in
South Africa, can be rated as one of the best pieces of disaster management
legislation in the world. The implementation of the principles contained in
the Act requires a multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach to
disaster management by all three spheres of government. The desired
outcomes will only be achieved with the establishment of the national,
provincial and municipal disaster management centres, as prescribed in the
Act. These centres, however, need to be staffed with competent disaster
management officials, who have to be provided with adequate and appropriate
equipment, systems and mechanisms to execute their disaster management task
effectively.

My concern is that the necessary mechanisms to fund the disaster management
function at provincial and municipal level are not clear at present. The
provision of the disaster management centres with adequate staff and
equipment is a very costly endeavour, which most provincial and municipal
structures will not, as it stands at present, be able to afford.

It is very important that national Government takes note of the fact that
the establishment of disaster management centres and the subsequent
staffing of those centres are too costly for provincial and municipal
structures to afford within their present budget allocation. It is
therefore recommended that national Government assists with the necessary
funding provision that will enable provincial and municipal authorities to
execute their role and function as required in the Act.

Chairperson, hon Minister, the Western Cape has had its fair share of
political instability, also at the sphere of local government. But I am
confident in reporting to you today that stability has returned, and that
our municipalities are focused. My main priority, coupled with the
provincial vision of ``iKapa elihlumayo: Hope, delivery and dignity for the
next decade'', is to ensure a focus on service delivery in this year and
the years to come. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Deputy Chairperson, Minister and Deputy Minister, MECs,
special delegates and members, the loss of Cape Town has really traumatised
our colleagues from the DA to the extent that, MEC Mr Afrika, they do not
live in the exciting times that you are referring to. Do you know what they
are doing? They are building their own laager, by now mobilising 150 000
policemen and -women to fight back.

We in the ANC support this Vote, precisely because it seeks to address the
problems that have been identified by our Government. [Applause.]

The MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Mr Chairperson and hon
members, allow me to start off by expressing a word of thanks to all those
who participated in this debate, including the Deputy Minister and the hon
MECs who are here today. Further, allow me to acknowledge, in particular,
the presence in the public gallery of some of the mayors, councillors,
municipal managers and other partners who were here yesterday for the
launch of the Vuna Awards. They stayed with us as we presented our budget
to the National Assembly. They soldiered on to stay with us today.
Sufficient words still have to be coined, to allow us to express our
gratitude for this gesture of solidarity.

A number of speakers have noted the progress which is being made towards
improving the functional efficiency of our system of government.
Constructive suggestions have been made as to what else needs to be done in
this regard. We have noted those suggestions with appreciation.

I want to single out at least three issues which arose in the course of our
discussion and comment briefly on them. Firstly, there was the issue of
municipal debt, which is indeed a matter of serious concern to us.
Secondly, there was the issue of disaster management and, lastly, the brief
comments which were made by Mr Lever in the House this morning.

Starting, as I promised, with the issue of municipal debt, I think it is
now a matter of public record that, concerned as we are about this
particular issue, we convened a national conference at which we presented
results of research conducted as to the causes of this problem. I think
that conference has played a very important role in helping us to identify
the measures that need to be taken.

However, the specific element that was raised relates to the huge amounts
owed to municipalities by provincial and national government departments.
We have embarked on a process which seeks to eliminate this particular
debt. We are working at establishing a new payment protocol through which
government departments will be able to deal with their municipal accounts.
We are certain that, with such a protocol in place, something that never
existed before in the history of this country, when we come back next year,
we will be talking about a new situation altogether.

Chairperson, we come next to the issue of disaster management. Firstly,
with regard to the observations made by the hon Mr Mkhalipi, who said that
a delegation from the NCOP visited the disaster management centre which is
housed in the Department of Provincial and Local Government, I think, that
these observations coincide with ours, namely, that we have an excellent
disaster management facility within the Department of Provincial and Local
Government. This observation can be confirmed by many communities which
have been touched by the healing hand of this disaster management centre as
they were seeking to recover from the devastating impact of disasters of
one kind or another.

However, what perhaps needs to be highlighted, and has possibly been under-
emphasised in the past, is that this disaster management centre actually
has come to constitute an instrument to transform the nature of South
Africa's relationship with other African countries. Talking as an African,
the word ``neighbour'' in the African context conjures up images of
interdependence and reciprocity. When you are in trouble in Africa, you can
count on the support of your neighbour. To millions of Mozambicans, this
country is a neighbour worthy of the name, in great measure because of the
central role played by the disaster management centre in organising relief
interventions after Mozambique was ravaged by floods.

Recently, the same disaster management centre co-ordinated nonmilitary
teams and rescue structures, which included trauma surgeons, who went on a
mission to Algeria in the aftermath of the earthquake. I am saying,
therefore, that they have become an instrument through which we are
transforming the nature of our relationship with neighbouring countries.

Mr Lever spoke, as he said, on behalf of the DA, about `this sector'. I
want us to underline the word `this'. He said: This sector is characterised
by one phrase, `lack of capacity'. Remarks about the so-called `this
sector', were limited to an expression of views about local government.
That alone betrays the inability to understand that the Ministry and
Department of Provincial and Local Government concern themselves with
issues of Government-wide cohesion, and therefore, when we talk about local
government, we talk about it as a sphere embedded in an interdependent
relationship with other spheres.

However, we possibly need also to look at this much touted `lack of
capacity' which the DA, this afternoon, gives as a reason for not
supporting this budget. There are three basic problems regarding this
attitude. Firstly, it reflects the lack of consistency in the understanding
of the DA of what is happening, at least in South Africa. Yesterday the DA
supported this budget in the National Assembly ... [Interjections.] ... and
conditions which prompted them to support it have changed overnight.
[Applause.]

The assertion about local government's lack of capacity is overgeneralised
and undifferentiated. Indeed, we have increased the equitable share of all
municipalities, including those that did not perform as well as we had
hoped. However, what needs to be understood, with regard to the element of
the increase in grants, is that this relates to capacity-building for these
municipalities. But an element of the increase in the equitable share is
also intended to subsidise the cost of payments which are made with respect
to the delivery of services to the indigent.

If we take the position that the DA is taking,  it  means  that  we  do  not
provide for subsidising the cost of services rendered to  the  indigent.  It
also means that we do not provide for the  building  of  capacity  of  these
municipalities. I want to state here and now that  one  can  only  put  that
kind of reasoning down to an unthinking aversion  to  the  local  government
sphere. [Interjections.]

One cannot expect a responsible government such as ours is, to be  complicit
in an action which seeks to further disadvantage  the  indigent,  an  action
which seeks to condemn relatively  weak  municipalities  to  a  position  of
perpetual weakness. We are not going to be complicit in that, and I want  to
assure the indigent people of South Africa, as well  as  the  municipalities
which are weak at present, that they can, at least, take heart in  the  fact
that people of goodwill remain in the majority both in  this  House  and  in
society at large. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
                    AFFAIRS - SADC PROTOCOL ON FISHERIES

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, I am going to try  and  behave  myself  as  a
disciplined cadre of the ANC. It is Friday today and I see I  have  only  10
minutes in which to speak on this protocol. I can assure  you  it  will  not
even take me five minutes to do so.

The Southern  African  region  straddles  three  great  oceans,  namely  the
Atlantic, the Indian and the Southern  ocean.  The  coastline  extends  from
Angola on the west coast, to Tanzania on the east coast. The coast  is  rich
in fish, seafood, mangroves and coral reefs, as well as  oil,  diamonds  and
other mineral deposits. The region has a  total  of  eight  coastal  states:
Angola,  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  Mauritius,  Mozambique,  Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa and Tanzania.

The exclusive economic zone of these countries is approximately five
million square kilometres, and in most instances, the living marine
resources of SADC waters are shared between two or more countries. The
major issue for coastal countries of Southern Africa is the depletion of
fish stocks by unsustainable levels of harvesting. Most of the region's
coastal and marine resources are under pressure from unsustainable raids
and methods of harvesting, which results from an increasing demand on
marine resources for food. There are also increasing incidents of pollution
from activities on land, and from oil spills and the potential impact of
sea levels rising, including inundation of major coastal settlements, with
associated damage to the ecosystems and infrastructure and the displacement
of populations.

Demand comes not only from the maritime countries, but also from inland
nations. The Southern African Development Community Protocol on Fisheries
was initiated at the workshop for inland and marine fisheries held in
Windhoek in February 1997. Based on this work, three consultants visited
all the Southern African Development Community member states to hold
discussions with relevant stakeholders and to formulate the draft protocol.
This was issued in December 1999 and immediately forwarded to the member
states for amendments and their comments. These were presented to be
discussed by national stakeholders in a regional workshop which was held in
Lusaka in April 2000. The final version of this protocol was approved by
all the fisheries Ministers in Maputo in May 2001.

The objective of this protocol is to promote responsible and sustainable
use of the living aquatic resources and ecosystems in our SADC countries.
It further notes that it is there to promote and enhance food security and
human health and to safeguard the livelihood of fishing communities.
Thirdly, it aims to generate economic opportunities for nationals in the
region, ensure that future generations benefit from these renewable
resources. Lastly, it aims to alleviate poverty with the ultimate objective
of eradicating it.

Chairperson, the Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs
recommends to the Council that, in terms of section 231(2) of the
Constitution, we approve this protocol.

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That concludes the debate. I
shall now put the question in respect of the second order. The question is
that the report be agreed to. As this decision is dealt with in terms of
section 65 of the Constitution, I need to ascertain very clearly whether
delegation heads are present. It looks like they are all here.

I shall now also allow provinces the opportunity to make their declaration
in terms of Rule 71 if they so wish. Is there any province wishing to make
any declaration of vote? Obviously not.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the question. I shall do this in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must please indicate to
the Chair whether they vote in favour of or against or abstain from voting.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Mr J J DOWRY: We do not support, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have eight provinces voting in
favour of this. The report is therefore adopted in accordance with section
65 of the Constitution.

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
  AFFAIRS - CARTAGENA PROTOCOL ON BIOSAFETY TO THE CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL
                                  DIVERSITY

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members, the Cartagena Protocol on
Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified by South
Africa, and this places an obligation on parties to the convention
regarding the protection of biosafety and biodiversity. The obligations of
the convention were very wide and this protocol narrowed them down
considerably.
The final text of the  Cartagena  Protocol  was  adopted  in  January  2000.
Although South Africa had been closely involved in the  development  of  the
Cartagena Protocol, the country had not signed the  protocol  on  time.  The
protocol contains references to a precautionary approach and  reaffirms  the
precaution language and principle 15 of the Rio Declaration  on  Environment
and Development.

The protocol also establishes a biosafety clearing house to facilitate the
exchange of information on living modified organisms and to assist
countries in the implementation of the protocol. In accordance with the
precautionary approach contained in principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on
Environment and Development, the objectives of the protocol are: To
contribute to and ensure an adequate level of protection in the field of
the safe transfer, and the handling and use of living modified organisms
resulting from modern biotechnology; to take into consideration the adverse
effects of modern biotechnology on the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity; and, thirdly, to take into account the risk to human
health and specifically to focus on the transfer of boundary movements.

Chairperson, the implications of access to the protocol to South Africa are
detailed. Because most of the provisions were already provided for South
Africa, only minor amendments to the current legislation will be necessary.
The capacity and resource commitment, however, will be significant and a
steering committee will be set up with the relevant Ministers to take the
process forward. Also, it was believed that the protocol would not impede
biotechnology.

Chairperson, the report of the Select Committee on Land and Environmental
Affairs on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety was dated 9 June 2003. The
Select Committee on Land and Environmental Affairs having considered the
request for approval by Parliament of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety
to the Convention on Biological Diversity, recommends that the Council, in
terms of section 231(2) of the Constitution, approves the said protocol.
The committee, however, appeals to the Department of Environmental Affairs
and Tourism to keep it abreast of further developments around the protocol.
Lastly, the committee also appeals to the Department of Environmental
Affairs and Tourism to promote and facilitate public awareness, education
and participation concerning the safe transfer, handling and use of living
modified organisms, as is stated in Article 23 of the Cartagena Protocol.
We move that this protocol be accepted by this House. I thank you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! That concludes the debate. I
shall now put the question. The question is that the report be agreed to.
As this decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,
I need to ascertain whether delegation heads are present.

I shall now also allow provinces the opportunity to make their declaration
in terms of Rule 71 if they so wish. Is there any province wishing to make

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: The Northern Cape supports.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: North West?

Mr Z S KOLWENI: North West ke wa rona [North West supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?
Mr J J DOWRY: Ons steun, Voorsitter. [We support, Chairperson.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Eight  provinces  voted  in  favour.
[Interjections.] I  was  looking  at  something  else.  Are  you  supporting
Western Cape?

Mr J J DOWRY: We support, Chairperson.

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  All  provinces  voted  in  favour.
[Applause.] I therefore declare the report agreed to in terms of section  65
of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 12:36.
