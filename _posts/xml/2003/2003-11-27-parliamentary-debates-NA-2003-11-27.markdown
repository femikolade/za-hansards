  than 28 February 2004.
Agreed to.

                        WOMEN IN CONFLICT SITUATIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN (ANC): Thank you, Deputy  Speaker.  As  we  mark
the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children, we  also
remember women  and  children  all  over  the  world  who  are  in  conflict
situations.

We remember women in the DRC, Burundi, Rwanda  and  others  who  were  raped
during the conflict and were infected with HIV/Aids. We  remember  women  in
Palestine and Israel where children are deprived of their rights to play  as
children and we call on all peace-loving people to  join  the  international
interreligious leaders in  their  peace  efforts  to  organise  a  rally  in
Jerusalem this December.

We urge all communities to join these peace ambassadors to make this  prayer
rally a success and break the anger  and  resentment  in  that  region,  and
contribute to lasting peace. Let the children  enjoy  their  childhood.  Let
them have a Merry Christmas this year. I thank you. [Applause.]

                       RACIAL QUOTAS IN POLICE SERVICE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, today's Cape Times states:  ``In
the interest of equity, 1 000  police  posts  advertised  not  for  coloured
applicants." [Interjections.] What is going on in South Africa?  Are  we  so
contaminated by apartheid that we say to  coloured  people  in  the  Western
Cape: There is no place for you; you are not black enough?

The ANC-New NP coalition here pretends to have  the  interests  of  coloured
people at heart. How do we justify telling people  that  racial  quotas  are
more important than ensuring a good competent police  force  of  people  who
will do the job of fighting crime?

There are 7 000 coloureds, 5  500  whites,  2  200  blacks,  and  85  Indian
members of the SAPS in the Western Cape. All of this bean  counting  reminds
me of the sickness of apartheid. Are we unable to escape from the  past  and
seek  a  new  future  where  merit,  not  colour,  is  what  counts,   where
opportunities are provided for  all,  whether  people  be  black  or  white,
Indian or coloured? Can't we  move  to  a  South  Africa  where  we  say  to
coloureds and everyone else:  You  belong;  you  are  part  of  the  rainbow
nation? [Applause.]

                          BY-ELECTION IN UKHAHLAMBA

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M MDLALOSE (IFP): Madam Speaker, yesterday there was a  by-election  in
Ward 12, uKhahlamba, which is in the uThukela District in  the  province  of
KwaZulu-Natal. The IFP won the by-election with 61%  of  the  votes  -  mark
you, 61% of the votes - followed by the ANC with 23% and the ACDP with  16%.
The big victory of the IFP is a  clear  indication  that  voters  have  full
confidence in  the  IFP.  We  wish  to  congratulate  Councillor  Bonginkosi
Khuzwayo, who was elected and wish him well in his endeavour  to  serve  the
people of ward 12, uKhahlamba. This is only the beginning.  [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

                            MIDRAND CONSTITUENCY

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms F HAJAIG (ANC): Thank you, Madam Speaker.  The  constituency  of  Midrand
comprises a large area between the cities of Johannesburg and  Pretoria.  It
is a complex area comprising an  industrial  hub,  middle-class  residential
areas, impoverished townships like Ivory Park, Ebony  Park  and  Rabie,  and
informal settlements like Kanana.

Despite all the problems facing our indigent communities, the  programme  of
visiting our schools has paid off, because the  Eqinisweni  High  School  in
Ivory Park was voted number one in the Gauteng province.

To deal with unemployment and the challenge of poverty, two  workshops  were
organised with the Department of  Trade  and  Industry  officials  who  were
invited to explain to the overflowing hall full of  people  what  programmes
were offered to promote entrepreneurship within the small, medium and  micro
business programme. Officials  of  the  Departments  of  Labour  and  Social
Development came to report back and answer questions  put  to  them  by  our
people.

On a rotating basis,  all  clinics  in  the  area  are  provided  with  food
parcels, blankets and clothing for HIV-positive and  TB  patients.  People's
problems concerning municipal  services  are  directed  immediately  to  the
various councillors so that relief can be speedily negotiated.

Houses are being built on an ongoing basis covering  the  bare  fields  that
existed before. The PCO has played  a  meaningful  role  in  mobilising  our
youth to register and  encouraging  voters  to  check  their  names  on  the
voter's roll. Much has been done, much remains to be done,  but  we  are  on
our way to a better life. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]
                                 ROAD SAFETY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

Tydens verlede jaar se feesseisoen het 1 882 mense  in  ongelukke  op  Suid-
Afrikaanse paaie gesterf. Ons kan  nie  'n  herhaling  van  so  'n  slagting
hierdie jaar op ons paaie toelaat nie. [During last year's festive season  1
882 people died in accidents on South  African  roads.  We  cannot  allow  a
repetition of such a massacre on our roads this year.]

The New NP has raised its concern with regard  to  road  safety  on  various
occasions. The recent spate of accidents involving trucks  and  buses  shows
that the enforcement of traffic laws and regulations must be a  priority  if
we want to end the unacceptably  high  number  of  fatal  accidents  on  our
roads.  Among  the  reasons  for  the  accidents  were  overloading,  driver
fatigue, unroadworthy trucks and drunk driving,  all  of  which  could  have
been prevented.

Daarom verwelkom die  Nuwe  NP  die  onlangse  maatreëls  wat  die  Minister
aangekondig het ten opsigte van swaar voertuie. Daar  moet  egter  toegesien
word dat dié maatreëls streng nagevolg word, anders baat dit niks. [The  New
NP therefore  welcomes  the  recent  measures  relating  to  heavy  vehicles
announced  by  the  Minister.  However,  these  measures  must  be  strictly
enforced, otherwise they will serve no purpose.]

There are currently about six million licensed  drivers  on  our  roads;  we
want to call on all motorists to be responsible and comply with the  traffic
rules. Road safety is  everyone's  priority,  especially  over  the  festive
season when the number of cars on our roads will double. The New NP  pledges
its support to the Arrive Alive campaign. Let us all  arrive  alive  at  our
destinations. I thank you.

                             RECENT BY-ELECTIONS
                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr P J GROENEWALD (VF):  Agb  Adjunkspeaker,  die  Vryheidsfront  Plus  het
vandag sterk groei getoon  in  al  die  plaaslike  bestuurstussenverkiesings
waaraan dié party deelgeneem het. Dit sluit in 'n goeie oorwinning  oor  die
DA in Bloemfontein en 'n stewige tweede  plek  ná  die  DA  in  Randfontein.
Daarteenoor het die steun vir die DA beduidend gedaal in die  Bloemfonteinse
tussenverkiesing, wat die VF onlangs gewen het, asook in die twee  plaaslike
tussenverkiesings wat gister in Uitenhage en in Randfontein gehou is.

In die DA-setel in Randfontein het die VF Plus  gister  535  stemme  behaal.
Dit beteken dat in Randfontein die DA se hoeveelheid stemme van 72% in  2000
na 47% gister gedaal het. Die daling in  DA-stemme  kan  daaraan  toegeskryf
word dat 'n beduidende hoeveelheid Afrikaanssprekende stemme hul rug op  die
DA draai en nou vir  die  Vryheidsfront  Plus  stem.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die
oneerlike politiek wat  die  DA  tydens  verkiesings  gebruik,  sal  in  die
toekoms steeds meer op  hulle  boemerang.  Die  misbruik  van  verstandelike
gestremdes tydens die verkiesing deur die DA is 'n skande.

Die VF Plus ondersoek tans ook 'n oortreding van die  Kieswet  deur  die  DA
oor 'n pamflet wat gister, op stemdag, versprei  is.  Die  pamflet  het  die
kiesers met leuens mislei oor die sogenaamde steun  wat  partye  op  daardie
tydstip van die stemdag sou hê. Die feite was  presies  die  teenoorgestelde
van dít wat die pamflet beweer het. Kiesers het hierná by die  Vryheidsfront
Plus om verskoning kom vra, dat hul eers  hierdie  krisis  moet  help  oplos
deur DA te stem, hoewel hulle eintlik Vryheidsfront Plus  ondersteuners  is.
Die Vryheidsfront Plus ondersoek  tans  hoe  ver  dié  tipe  propaganda  die
Kieswet  oortree.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [Tyd   verstreke.]   (Translation   of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD (FF): Hon Deputy Speaker,  the  Freedom  Front  Plus  has
shown significant growth today in all the local government  by-elections  in
which this party participated. This includes a good victory over the  DA  in
Bloemfontein and a strong second place  after  the  DA  in  Randfontein.  In
contrast support for the DA decreased significantly in the Bloemfontein  by-
election, which the FF won recently,  as  well  as  in  the  two  local  by-
elections which were held in Uitenhage and Randfontein yesterday.

In the DA seat in Randfontein the FF Plus polled 535 votes  yesterday.  This
means that in Randfontein the DA's number of votes  decreased  from  72%  in
2000 to 47% yesterday. The decrease  in  the  number  of  DA  votes  can  be
ascribed to the fact that a significant number of Afrikaans-speaking  voters
have turned their back on the DA and are now voting for  the  Freedom  Front
Plus.  [Interjections.]  The  dishonest  politics  used  by  the  DA  during
elections will backfire on them to an increasing extent in the  future.  The
abuse of the mentally disabled by the DA during the election is a disgrace.

The FF Plus  is  at  present  also  investigating  a  contravention  of  the
Electoral  Act  by  the  DA  regarding  a  pamphlet  that  was   distributed
yesterday, on polling day. The pamphlet misled the voters  with  lies  about
the so-called support which parties enjoyed at that  stage  of  the  polling
day. The facts were the exact opposite  of  those  given  in  the  pamphlet.
Afterwards voters came to apologise to the Freedom Front Plus,  saying  that
they first had to help to resolve this crisis by voting  DA,  although  they
were in fact Freedom Front Plus supporters. The Freedom  Front  Plus  is  at
present investigating to what extent this  type  of  propaganda  contravenes
the Electoral Act. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]]

           PROVISION OF ANTIRETOVIRALS IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S H NTOMBELA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC welcomes  the  decision  taken
by  Cabinet  on  Wednesday,  19  November  2003,  to  adopt   the   detailed
operational plan for  the  provision  of  antiretroviral  treatment  in  the
public health sector. This decision has gained the South African  Government
applause from the international community. This  plan  will  strengthen  the
Government's very comprehensive five-year strategy adopted in 2002.

As the ANC we commend  Government's  approach  on  this  matter  as  it  has
consistently sought to ensure that our response to  HIV/Aids  is  driven  by
our people's needs and by considerations of  affordability,  sustainability,
and the best scientific information available.

We further commend the Government for handling this  serious  matter  facing
our people in a responsible  manner,  refusing  to  yield  to  opportunistic
pressures from those who  seek  to  score  political  points,  even  at  the
expense of the lives of our people.

Since there is still no cure for HIV/Aids, let us continue doing  everything
humanly possible to ensure that prevention remains  at  the  centre  of  our
strategy. Let  us  care,  and  treat  opportunistic  infections  and  create
greater social awareness. Let us  strengthen  the  partnership  of  hope.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

                           CRIME IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Miss  S  RAJBALLY  (MF):  Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  Noting   the
seriousness of crime in KwaZulu-Natal, the MF is pleased and  expresses  its
gratitude to the SA Police Service for working closely with  the  community-
based committees in striving to combat crime in KZN.

Crime, however, remains a  major  challenge,  and  the  MF  hopes  that  the
involvement of the Department of Safety and Security will assist  in  making
KZN a safer place to live in. The statistics on crime in KZN are  scary  and
living in fear of losing your life is common.  We  need  to  strengthen  our
fight against crime.

The determination of  communities  and  the  SAPS  to  stamp  out  crime  is
intense, but minimal resources hinder this achievement. It is greatly  hoped
that the Budget of this year will assist the supply of resources being  made
available to the SAPS. The protection of our people  is  our  constitutional
duty.

We thank the department for all it has done thus far,  and  I  am  confident
that with the department's concerned attention,  safety  and  security  will
prevail. Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

                           CASTRATION FOR RAPISTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms T E MILLIN (IAM): Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Against  the  background  of
the 16-day campaign  of  activism  against  woman  and  child  abuse,  media
reports yesterday noted that Zambia -  where  400  known  child  rapes  have
occurred during the first half of 2003, a 68% increase from the same  period
in 2002 - is considering castrating rapists. MPs in Zambia are  giving  this
arguably barbaric method their approval as  a  deterrent  to  the  far  more
barbaric act of child rape, allowing the proposal to  go  to  their  cabinet
for consideration.

The IAM would support  similar  legislation  here  in  order  to  deter  the
incidence of woman and child rape, as this form of punishment  -  castration
- would not only reduce the pressure of overcrowded prison populations,  but
would also obviate the current 80%  repeat  rate  by  offenders.  Therefore,
such legislation would provide a  meaningful  contribution  to  the  current
campaign of no violence against women and children, and promote a safer  and
better life for all. Viva South Africa!

                            IMBIZO IN MPUMALANGA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P M MATHEBE (ANC): Deputy  Speaker,  as  part  of  the  ANC  Government's
commitment  to  deepening  democracy,  good  governance  and  accountability
through consultation and accessibility, the  Deputy  President  attended  an
imbizo in Mpumalanga on 17 and 18 November 2003.  This  imbizo  successfully
brought together the people  of  our  rural  and  urban  areas  -  different
communities of faith, youth, women and traditional leaders of our province.

It was indeed people's power in action  when  the  people  of  Umkomaaz  and
Moretele asked the Deputy President questions about the shortage  of  water,
the slow pace of the process of finalising land  claims,  unemployment,  and
the lack of institutions of higher learning in the area.

The people thanked Government for working with them in housing delivery  and
for all the efforts the Government is  making  in  alleviating  poverty.  To
further emphasise the confidence that the people of the  area  have  in  the
ANC-led Government, the by-election held on 26 November 2003 in  Delmas  Rot
was overwhelmingly won by the ANC. The results were as follows: ANC  -  79%;
UDM - 14%; PAC - 5%; IFP - only 2%. I thank you. [Applause.]

                            BY-ELECTIONS RESULTS

                            (Member's Statement)
Mnr T D LEE (DA): Adjunkspeaker, die DA het gister  al  drie  sy  setels  in
tussenverkiesings  behou.  Hy  het  ook  by  verstek  in  die   Noord-Kaapse
munisipaliteit, Renosterberg, 'n setel by die ANC afgeneem.

In Randfontein, wat voorheen as Mulder-wêreld bekend gestaan  het,  het  die
DA 48% van die stemme gekry, die VF Plus 30%,  die  ANC  21%,  en  die  ACDP
0,6%. Dit is Dr Boy Geldenhuys se kiesafdeling, maar die  Nuwe  NP  het  nie
eens gestaan nie.

In Kimberley het die DA  97%  van  die  stemme  gekry  en  die  ANC  3%.  In
Uitenhage het die DA 54%, die ANC 39%, die NA 6% en die  PAC  0,8%  van  die
stemme gekry.

Afrikaanssprekende kiesers in tradisioneel  konserwatiewe  gebiede  het  die
separatistiese  en  rassistiese  agenda  van  die  regse  vleuel  uitdruklik
verwerp  ...  [Tussenwerpsels.]   (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr T D LEE (DA): Deputy Speaker, the DA retained retained seats it  already
held in three by-elections yesterday. By default, it also took a  seat  from
the ANC in the Northern Cape municipality of Renosterberg.

In Randfontein, which was formerly known as Mulder country,  the  DA  polled
48% of the votes, the FF Plus 30%, the ANC 21% and the ACDP 0,6%. It  is  Dr
Boy Geldenhuy's constituency, but the  New  NP  did  not  even  contest  the
election.

In Kimberley the DA polled 97% of the votes and the  ANC  3%.  In  Uitenhage
the DA polled 54%, the ANC 39%, the NA 6% and the PAC 0,8%.

Afrikaans-speaking  voters  in   traditionally   conservative   areas   have
emphatically rejected the separatist and racist agenda  of  the  right  wing
... [Interjections.]]

Mr L M GREEN (ACDP): I rise  on  a  point  of  order,  Deputy  Speaker.  The
quotation, or the statistics given by the hon  member  ...  [Interjections.]
No, I just want to ask him something.  He  says  ACDP  something  per  cent.
Isn't it perhaps CDP? I am sure he's referring to the CDP.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No,  hon  member.  The  hon  member  can  look  at  the
correctness of the details of his statement. Please finish  your  statement,
hon member.

Mnr T D LEE (DA): Afrikaanssprekende kiesers in  tradisioneel  konserwatiewe
gebiede het die separatistiese en rassistiese agenda van  die  regse  vleuel
uitdruklik verwerp ten gunste van die DA se benadering, wat  'n  nie-rassige
alternatief vir die ANC wil bou. Die ANC moet nou weet dat  wanneer  hy  die
Vryheidsfront vlei en paai hy hom vereenselwig met  'n  party  wat  in  wese
rassisties  bly.  [Tyd  verstreke.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Mr T D LEE (DA): Afrikaans-speaking voters  in  traditionally  conservative
areas have emphatically rejected the separatist and  racist  agenda  of  the
right wing in favour of the DA's approach, who wants to build  a  non-racial
alternative to the ANC. The ANC must now realise that when it  flatters  and
appeases  the  Freedom  Front,  it  is  associating  with  a   party   which
essentially remains racist. [Time expired.]]

                           MEMBERS' GYM FACILITIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP):  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  wheels  of  Parliament
sometimes turn quickly, and sometimes slowly, but we must rejoice - even  as
opposition parties - that they do turn and that we help them to do so.

At the beginning of the  second  democratic  parliamentary  session,  imbued
with the desire to see through  a  healthy  term,  I  appealed  to  the  hon
Speaker to give members gym facilities and an exercise space in which to  do
yoga, pilates and aerobics, and to get dietary advice. What we had was  old,
cold, dark and always locked. It cried out for transformation.
The matter was taken forward by the IFP  Chief  Whip  and  by  the  Members'
Support Committee. This week I investigated the state of the gyms. They  are
still locked and unusable, but revamped, and by next year  we  will  have  a
state-of-the-art gym open for members to pump up muscles and push  up  heart
rates.

May we hope that by the time the third parliamentary session  ends,  members
will also have a pleasant space with a view of blue sky and green  trees  in
which to practise yoga, pilates and aerobics.

On behalf of the IFP, I wish members a happy and healthy  holiday.  May  you
all drive safely, dine well, and don't let the election stomp give  you  leg
cramps or headaches. Thank you.

[Ms M N OLIPHANT: Deputy Speaker, as the ANC we are grateful for a job  well
done by the KwaZulu-Natal MECs in working together to fight poverty so  that
people are able to overcome  hunger.  Even  as  I  speak,  last  month  they
introduced a community work programme, which will cost R1,2 million  in  the
area  of  oBuka.  This  indicates  that  the  programme  of  developing  the
community together, which is called the IDP, is working.

All this is an indication that the Congress is determined to  fight  poverty
to make the lives of the people of South Africa better, without  looking  at
party politics. We therefore appeal to all the people  of  this  country  to
work with the Congress in rebuilding this country so that  their  lives  may
become better.

This resulted in the Congress polling 1 901 votes, the IFP only  264  votes,
while the ACDP did not poll a single vote  in  yesterday's  election,  which
was held in Ward  12,  KwaNdengezi,  in  the  eThekwini  municipality.  This
indicates that  the  Congress  won  by  85%  in  the  Ward.  [Applause.]  We
therefore congratulate Councillor Ngcobo on winning  the  election.  We  say
congratulations Congress, congratulations!

HON MEMBERS: Congratulations!]

     DIFFICULTIES POLICEMAN IS HAVING IN PASSING HORSERIDING COURSE AND
                         OBTAINING DRIVER'S LICENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (Nuwe NP): Adjunkspeaker, vir  'n  bevelvoerder  van
die polisie se Veediefstaleenheid op  Wepener  het  die  uitdrukking  om  'n
verkeerde  perd  op  te  saal  nuwe  betekenis  gekry,   aangesien   hy   sy
perdrykursus gedruip het. Dit lyk of hy sy rybewystoets ook eers gaan  slaag
as die perde horings kry, want hy probeer blykbaar nou al sedert 1982 om  sy
voertuigrybewys te kry.

Die Nuwe NP wil 'n beroep doen  op  die  Minister  om  die  moontlikheid  te
ondersoek om vir dié kaptein 'n fiets aan te skaf en om  ook  te  onthou  'n
donkie is 'n wonderlike ding. Indien dit nie moontlik is nie, wil ons  darem
net vir dié bevelvoerder sê: "Ou perd, hou  moed".  Onthou,  met  dapper  en
stapper bereik 'n mens darem ook jou bestemming.

In die gees van "ou ryperd, ons ry die pad  tesame"  wil  die  Nuwe  NP  die
Minister van Arbeid versoek om geld uit  die  Vaardigheidsheffingsfonds  aan
sy     kabinetskollega     beskikbaar     te     stel      vir      spesiale
perdryvaardigheidsopleiding vir hierdie kaptein, anders gaan hy gedurig  die
kar voor die perde span in sy pogings om misdadigers te vang.  Baie  dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Deputy Speaker, for a  commanding  officer
of the Stock Theft Unit of the police in  Wepener  the  expression  "backing
the wrong horse" took on a new meaning, because he  failed  his  horseriding
course. By all accounts he is also only going to pass his  driver's  licence
test when horses sprout wings, because he  has  apparently  been  trying  to
obtain his driver's licence since 1982.

The New NP wants to appeal to the Minister to  investigate  the  possibility
of acquiring a bicycle for this captain  and  also  not  to  forget  that  a
donkey is a wonderful thing. If this is not  possible,  we  would  at  least
like to say to this commanding officer: Don't  despair.  Remember,  one  can
also reach one's destination on foot.

In the spirit of "ou ryperd, ons ry die pad tesame" [old horse, we  take  on
the road together] the New NP wants to request the  Minister  of  Labour  to
make money available  from  the  Skills  Development  Fund  to  his  Cabinet
colleague  for  special  horseriding  skills  training  for  this   captain,
otherwise he will constantly be putting the cart before the  horses  in  his
efforts to apprehend criminals. Thank you very much.]
                     TRANSFORMATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION

                                 (Statement)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker,  with  your  permission,  I
greet the Vice Chancellor of the National University of Ireland  at  Galway,
which recently conferred an honorary degree on Mr Nelson Mandela.

Madam Speaker, you will recall that I made a promise  to  this  House,  some
time ago, that  I  would  report  to  you  on  the  implementation  of  this
Government's programme for the transformation  of  higher  education.  I  am
therefore before you this afternoon to honour my undertaking.

I can think of few better ways to end an eventful year, both for this  House
and education, and a very  productive  year,  than  to  inform  you  of  the
significant progress that we are making towards the realisation of the  goal
of a transformed higher education system that the nation can truly  own  and
truly be proud of.
It is no exaggeration to claim that we are making history.  Indeed,  we  are
on the eve of the birth  of  four  new  institutions  which  we  established
through the merger of existing institutions on 1 January  2004.  These  are:
the University of KwaZulu-Natal from the merger of the University  of  Natal
and the University of Durban-Westville; the North West University  from  the
merger of the University of Potchefstroom and the University  of  the  North
West; the Tshwane University of  Technology  from  the  merger  of  Pretoria
Technikon, Technikon Northern Gauteng and Technikon North West; and the  new
University of South Africa from the merger  of  Unisa  and  Technikon  South
Africa and the Vudek component of Vista University.

In January 2005, five  more  institutions  will  be  established:  the  Cape
Peninsula University of Technology - the Minister of Finance  shouldn't  say
anything  rude  -  the  University  of  Johannesburg,  the  Nelson   Mandela
Metropolitan University in Port Elizabeth, the  University  of  Limpopo  and
the Walter Sisulu University of Technology and Science in the Eastern Cape.
There can be no doubt that the higher education landscape  is  well  on  its
way to  reflecting  the  values,  the  ethos  and  the  aspirations  of  our
democracy, away from the false  divisions  and  the  low  standards  of  the
apartheid past, which have, for far too long, scarred our  higher  education
system, and limited its ability to truly respond to the current  and  future
needs of our country and our democracy.

These new beginnings that we are witnessing  are  possible  because  of  the
commitment of this Government to building an efficient, effective, fair  and
equitable higher education system that is able to meet the  country's  needs
in terms of high level human resources, including the  professionals  needed
to drive key  sectors  in  the  economy  and  those  who  will  support  the
provision of social, health and education services to  improve  the  quality
of life of all our citizens. The new system will  also  nurture  the  coming
generations' intellectuals,  especially  black  and  women  researchers  and
scholars who should play a critically important role in the maturing of  our
democracy.

Let me assure you that our commitment to a new vision for  higher  education
is matched by the resources necessary for  implementation.  You  may  recall
the recent mid-term Budget statement of the Minister of Finance a  few  days
ago in which he  reiterated  the  Government's  commitment  to  funding  the
institutional reconstruction of the system.

Over the next three to five years R3 billion rands will be invested in  this
restructuring process. This is an investment in  the  coming  generation  of
students and staff who will benefit from higher education. Equally, it's  an
investment in the future social, economic and  political  wellbeing  of  our
country. I would  like  to  thank  my  colleague  Minister  Manuel  and  his
department for their confidence in our ability and capacity  to  restructure
and reshape our universities and technikons.

The transformation of higher education has been very  long  in  the  making.
Since the early nineties,  many  studies,  commissions  and  inquiries  have
informed our thinking. Here I need to single out the ANC  which,  nearly  10
years ago, with remarkable prescience, in the midst  of  struggle,  produced
an extraordinary document entitled A  policy  framework  for  education  and
training  or, as it's affectionately known, ``the yellow book'',  which  has
nothing to do with a lack of backbone; it's just the impressive colour  that
they use. The yellow book has guided our efforts in transforming the  entire
education system.

So, in the context of higher education, it called on  us  to  transform  the
system for the  development  of  policy  ``aimed  at  economic  growth,  the
enhancement of democratic political system, promotion of  the  cultural  and
intellectual life  of  our  society''.  As  I  mentioned  earlier,  this  is
precisely what we are trying to achieve, viz to carry  out  this  remarkable
mandate of 10 years ago.

I would like to express my deep appreciation to the many men and  women  who
have contributed to the rich  body  of  work  that  has  shaped  our  change
agenda. It would also be remiss of me if I  did  not  acknowledge  the  role
played by generations of students and staff activists  whose  struggles  and
sacrifices have helped us to achieve our dreams.

Let us remember the martyrs of 1976 and the students who  lost  their  lives
in the campus strife in  the  dark  days  of  the  1980s  in  the  state  of
emergency as well as the leadership  and  rank  and  file  of  the  national
student organisations such  as  the  South  African  Students  Organisation,
Saso, the Azanian Students Organisation, Azaso, the National Union of  South
African Students, Nusas, the cadres of the National Education  Co-ordinating
Committee, the South African National Students  Congress,  Sansco,  and  the
South African Students Congress.

I'm also reminded of the tragic and untimely death of  Dr  Kgomotso  Maseba-
Langa, the first secretary-general of Sansco, who was  gunned  down  only  a
few days ago. There are great patriots - Jack Simon,  Roy  Hoffenberg,  Rick
Turner and David Webster - who fought for real academic freedom.  While  the
others remained silent and made their peace  with  the  socio  and  military
system of apartheid, these patriots will  always  be  remembered  for  their
tremendous contributions to the vitality and life of our universities.

Closer to this House, the role of the Portfolio Committee on Education  must
be acknowledged. The committee, under the exceptional  leadership  of  Blade
Nzimande laid the  policy  and  legislative  foundation  for  the  post-1994
transformation of higher education.

The transformation  of  our  higher  education  system  has  been  and  will
continue to be an extremely challenging task. It is one that requires us  to
balance different interests and needs. However, I can confidently  say  that
it is informed by a set of principles that  are  articulated  in  the  White
Paper of 1997, entitled ``A  programme  for  the  transformation  of  higher
education'', and these principles  are  obviously  not  negotiable,  because
they've been accepted by this Government and this House.

Amongst  these  principles  are  a  commitment  to   equity   and   redress,
democratisation,  development,  quality   enhancement,   effectiveness   and
efficiency, academic freedom and public accountability.  The  very  ways  in
which we give effect to these principles have shaped the  unfolding  of  the
new system. It is a higher education system that is rooted in the  realities
of our society. Put differently, it is a higher education system  for  South
Africa and of South Africa.

It has been suggested by Malegapuru  Makgoba  and  Sipho  Seepe  that  ``the
central issue for universities today is an institutional  transformation  in
higher  education  that  will  provide  for  the  production  of  knowledge,
recognises the African condition as historical and defines the key  task  as
one of coming to grips with it critically''. It is my  vision  that  all  of
our universities should be responsive  to  and  embracing  of  the  national
reconstruction and development agenda through the  core  work  of  teaching,
research and community service.

This approach enjoys wide support both locally and  internationally.  As  is
stated  in  the  executive  summary  of  the  Association  of   Commonwealth
Universities, entitled ``Engagement as a core value for  the  university  in
2001'':


  The world depends increasingly on universities for knowledge,  prosperity
  and policy-thinking. Universities are thus required to become engines  of
  development for  people,  for  institutions  and  democracy  in  general.
  Engagement defines the whole  orientation  and  tone  of  a  university's
  policy and practice. Mission statements, strategic planning, teaching and
  learning policies, and research  directions  must  evince  and  encourage
  active respect for the concerns and challenges faced by society.

This is particularly important as we leave the old order.  As  we  begin  to
develop the new order, the sense of the engagement by higher education  must
be right in the centre of our tasks.

Such critical engagement  between  universities  and  the  societies  within
which they are located hardly translates into subservience  of  the  academy
to either the market or national political agendas, as  some  analysts  seem
to suggest. In fact, South Africa leads  the  world  in  ensuring  that  the
World Trade Organisation's approach of assimilating education as a  service,
as a  commodity  and  commercialising  higher  education  goes  against  the
fundamental ideas that we hold very dear, and there  is  reconstruction  and
development.

In other words, the market cannot determine the needs  of  higher  education
and the needs of our people. It is important to  remember,  therefore,  that
South Africa began the international  debate  as  to  how  the  World  Trade
Organisation Uruguay round  assimilated  education,  particularly  training,
and higher education to service for which there'll be free movement  between
the countries.

We offer free movement to one country, then the most favoured nation  clause
wants to offer it to everyone. Therefore, South Africa will be opened  as  a
source of profit, not as a service to higher education.  South  Africa  will
become a source of profit for the world, and the world largely  means  those
countries that do not invest in South Africa through direct investment  will
undoubtedly invest in education and training.

So, let me make it clear that there will continue to be space in our  higher
education institutions for all forms of  enquiry,  including  the  so-called
pure and applied research. As Minister, I have always tried  to  maintain  a
balance between pure and applied research both in the arts  and  humanities,
and especially in the sciences.

Teaching and learning must be in the full spectrum of academic  as  well  as
career-focused disciplines and fees. The  important  thing  is  that  as  we
enter this period  of  great  imaginative  thinking,  our  higher  education
institutions must be receptive, as they are in the rest  of  the  world.  As
the Vice Chancellor of the National University of  Ireland  will  tell  you,
Galway, 20 years ago, was an institution without a future. Now,  because  of
the investment in science and technology, in language and  in  arts,  Galway
is one of the most thriving universities in the whole of Europe.

The state will continue to  invest.  Part  of  that  investment  must  be  a
recognition that the universities must be  receptive  to  the  needs  -  the
intellectual, the  moral  and  ethical  needs  -  of  our  society.  We  are
committed to promoting diversity in  institutional  arrangements  in  higher
education.  We  will  not  be  bullied  into  uniform  and   one-dimensional
perspectives  on   what   constitutes   a   university.   It   must   be   a
multidimensional approach.

A hallmark of the new system should, however, be a commitment to quality  in
every aspect of the academic project, be it  teaching,  research,  community
service  or  in   the   administration,   management   and   governance   of
universities. We simply cannot be complacent when it comes to  quality.  Our
students deserve, hon members from all parts of this House,  the  very  best
in teaching and research that our country can afford, and  should  be  given
the opportunity to grow  through  a  quality  higher  education  experience,
which should not be marred by prejudice or poverty.

There is much that Government can do to provide the policy  and  legislative
frameworks  for  the  transformation  of  higher  education.  We  can   also
endeavour to resource  the  sector  properly  and  to  put  into  place  the
planning and quality assurance mechanisms, as we've done, required to  steer
the system. However, much of the outcomes will be shaped and  determined  by
the leadership of our higher education institutions, the councils, the  vice
chancellors and the student bodies.

I am pleased to report that the councils and vice  chancellors  of  most  of
our universities have embraced the challenges of  transformation  with  much
energy, enthusiasm and insight. I am most grateful for their commitment  and
support in this period  of  transition,  because  no  country  has  had  our
history.  No  country  has  therefore  tried  to  renew,   restructure   and
transform.

In conclusion, I would like to thank you for the privilege of  briefing  you
this afternoon on an area of education  which  I  know  is  of  considerable
interest to this House. However, for those of you who think that  everything
is now settled, that we have finished with this task, let me leave you  with
the powerful words of the Nigerian poet, Ben Okri, who reminds us that:


  They are only the exhausted who think that they have arrived at the final
  destination, the end of the road with all their dreams achieved,  and  no
  new dreams to hold.

We have many dreams which are still with us. We hold them  very  dear.  With
your assistance, we will fulfil them for the reconstruction  of  our  higher
education system. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr M H STEELE: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, the higher education  sector  of
this country, as is the case in most  countries,  often  attracts  political
debate which is proportionately greater than its budget  or  the  percentage
of the  population  that  it  engages.  There  are  good  reasons  for  this
disproportionate emphasis. The institutions  themselves,  whether  they  are
traditional universities or the new  universities  of  technology,  are  the
physical embodiments of intellectual capital, nurturing the minds that  will
produce the theoretical breakthroughs  of  the  future.  They  also  produce
employable graduates with valuable skills and every skilled worker  supports
the jobs of many who are unskilled.

To establish power and control over a higher education sector is a  struggle
for any government. Judging by the hon Minister's statement,  he  now  feels
able to congratulate himself on having achieved a measure of this control.

The Minister has  reflected  on  some  of  the  battles  of  the  past,  and
specifically on the tragic events of Soweto, 1976. It was a classic  example
of the folly of trying to  impose,  by  force  and  bureaucratic  edict,  an
education policy on an unwilling population. But 1976, decisive  as  it  may
have been for the future of apartheid, was not the beginning of the  clashes
between the state and the higher education sector.

The grossly misnamed Extension of Universities  Act,  which  the  former  NP
passed on the universities during the 1950s and 60s,  brought  a  passionate
reaction  from   particularly   the   English-speaking   institutions.   The
imposition of racial quotas and the denial of access of  black  students  to
the previously open universities was bitterly resented. It  was  opposed  by
staff and students of the day  as  a  flagrant  assault  on  their  academic
freedom and was the crudest form of racial discrimination.

Some of the issues that were foremost in the debate then are still  with  us
today.  These  are  issues  such  as  centralist   control,   academic   and
institutional autonomy, racial equity and justice.

The Minister is expansive on those issues  which  are  dear  to  his  heart,
particularly the changes which have resulted from institutional  mergers.  I
suspect that the Minister is a  statist  at  heart,  and  he  must  be  very
satisfied that the directives that have flowed from his Ministry  have  seen
newly compounded institutions come into being all over the country. We  have
to ask whether these mergers were ever primarily about delivering  a  better
quality of education to larger numbers of students or whether their  primary
goal was not simply about greater centralised control.

Have these mergers produced  greater  capacity  for  improved  teaching  and
research or merely greater compliance? Have the new  institutions  the  same
credibility among students and the wider  public  which  their  predecessors
enjoyed? I note that the Minister is silent on issues such as these  in  his
statement. For example, the Universities of Durban-Westville and Natal  have
been anything but enthusiastic partners. The merging of these  two  fiercely
independent  universities  has  been  accompanied  by  much  controversy.  I
suspect it has left a legacy of future mistrust.

The Minister can hardly be satisfied with  the  events  at  Durban-Westville
that led him to dispatch his own external assessor to investigate.  The  new
University of the North West has also come  into  being  over  a  legacy  of
unhappiness. Some former alumni  of  Potchefstroom  University  are  rightly
concerned over  the  loss  of  their  former  university's  character  while
students  of  the  former  University  of  Bophuthatswana/North  West   have
protested at possible fee increases. [Interjections.] It was, originally.

This would have been a glorious opportunity for  the  Minister  to  make  an
unequivocal declaration preserving the status of Afrikaans as  a  medium  of
instruction and dominant culture in at least two of  the  former  Afrikaans-
medium universities. But allowing for this kind of autonomy,  diversity  and
independence is not the style of the current Ministry. We  look  forward  to
hearing how the union of Unisa, Vista and Technikon RSA has resulted in  the
decentralised delivery of quality distance education.

The Minister is also silent about the need of the  higher  education  sector
to continue expanding. We see that the Minister is  now  not  so  optimistic
about the  massification  that  was  talked  about  in  February  2001.  The
Minister could also have congratulated many of  the  country's  universities
on the extent to which they have already transformed  themselves.  Pretoria,
Wits and UCT now all have more than 30% black enrolments.

We prefer to see a commitment  to  identifying  talent  and  potential  that
exists across all our communities. We prefer merit to be the only  criterion
for  success  and  for  academic  selection.  We  welcome   the   Minister's
commitment to academic and institutional quality. The Minister may not  like
to acknowledge it, but the academic enterprise is a classic example  of  the
free market, the market of ideas.

I hope the Minister will  also  welcome  the  inevitable  challenge  to  the
current orthodoxy that will come from  the  higher  education  institutions.
Academics and students will never refrain from critique of  any  established
status quo and even the policies of the  ruling  party  will  be  ruthlessly
evaluated. The right to dissent is as alive today as it was in the  60s  and
70s. Our Minister should be encouraging the kind of creativity and  critique
that only independent and autonomous institutions can  produce.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Deputy Speaker, our country has undergone  a  metamorphosis
in many respects in order to undo what the  apartheid  regime  did  in  this
country. We have seen Government  bodies  replacing  school  committees;  we
have seen learners having representative councils;  we  have  seen  learners
accessing schools that were like ivory towers in which resources were  never
a problem compared to the previously disadvantaged schools.

Higher education has been one of the areas in education which one would  not
dare tamper with because it has been an environment  in  which  intellectual
power was used to perpetuate political and economic power for a select  few.
Of  course,  there  have  been   zealous   efforts   from   the   previously
disadvantaged  institutions  to  empower  the   African   masses   for   the
metamorphosis we are still undergoing as a country.

Most of us are where we are today because of  these  institutions,  deprived
of resources as they were. Today, in each day, we hope for a better  present
and the very best for the future. Transformation is not a  stroke-of-the-pen
issue; humans will always  be  involved  since  transformation  is  for  the
people by the people.

As we transform higher education, we realise that these institutions have  a
culture each one has engendered and adopted over the years. It could  be  an
administrative culture, academic culture, admission  culture,  etc.  In  the
light of these issues, we should at all costs try  to  accommodate  students
that have been victims of the old order who cannot move at a  fast  pace  to
catch  up  with  the  intricacies  of  a  sophisticated  and  well-resourced
learning environment, an environment  that  has  also  not  thought  of  the
weakness of someone different as a normal weakness but as a malady.
These students must not be made to feel that they do  not  belong  at  those
institutions in the first place. They should  feel  that  transformation  is
also embracing them in their structural weakness.  There  must  be  academic
efforts to make them cope with the situation. Also, Mr  Minister,  we  would
like to appeal that the restructuring process should  not  hugely  victimise
African academics, as this  will  create  problems  and  the  end  will  not
justify the means. Everybody, especially those who  were  on  the  receiving
end,  should  feel  that  transformation  has  brought  them  some  if   not
substantial good.

The IFP supports the transformation process. I thank you.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: Deputy Speaker, the  New  NP  wishes  to  congratulate  the
various educational institutions on reaching agreement on a great number  of
issues  in  the  process  of  their  respective  mergers   into   a   single
institution.

This has been a give-and-take debate  and  it  is  proof  of  the  practical
goodwill that exists in our country. This process was started in  the  early
1990s and, after many studies, commissions, debates, etc, we have today  the
realisation of the idea that started back in 1990.

The New NP calls on these institutions of higher education  to  live  up  to
the proud record that some of these institutions  built  up  over  the  past
years, so that the students who leave with their qualifications may  realise
that as far as excellence is concerned they can  compete  equally  with  the
rest of the world.

As the hon Minister has said,  much  of  the  outcome  will  be  shaped  and
determined by the leadership of our higher education institutions.  We  call
on leadership, but especially the New NP  calls  on  the  students  too,  to
conduct themselves with  dedication  and  discipline,  because  they  are  a
fortunate group of people to have the chance to  further  their  studies.  I
thank you.

Ms C DUDLEY: Deputy Speaker, the ACDP supports positive  transformation  and
recognises the  difficulties  and  challenges  involved.  A  letter  from  a
student in KwaZulu-Natal highlights some of the challenges they  faced  from
a student's perspective. She writes:


  I have been a student at the University of Natal  for  four  years,  this
  year completing my honours degree. Details for the event have been scant.
  A facade has been constructed around  the  involvement  of  students  and
  their opinions. When questions and queries have been  raised,  they  have
  been met with blank nods and promises of "we'll see".


  Little consideration has been afforded the students during  this  period.
  Lecturers  and  professors  who  sit  on  various  merger  meetings   are
  continuously called to emergency meetings. We are then told at  the  last
  minute that lectures or seminars have been postponed or  cancelled.  Both
  students and lecturers have had to  organise  periods  outside  of  their
  regular timetable to ensure  completion  of  the  work.  Semester  dates,
  graduation dates and exam dates have been adjusted outside  consultation.
  When problems have arisen as a result, little has been done to help.

Now, at the time of writing they were about  to  write  supplementary  exams
and were faced with the possibility of graduating from a university with  no
name. They were very pleased that there was now a name.

The ACDP would like to remind the hon Minister  of  the  importance  of  the
responsibility that he has to  see  that  student  politics  on  campus  are
managed properly to ensure that violence and intimidation do not enjoy  free
reign, and we wish him all the best. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agb mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, die agb  Minister  kom  en
hy  sê  dat  as  ons  kyk  na  ons  akademiese  instellings,  dan  moet  dit
instellings wees van intellek, morele waardes, hoë akademiese standaarde  en
gehalte.

Ek wil vir die agb Minister sê die VF Plus stem 100% saam  dat  dit  behoort
te wees hoe ons akademiese instellings daar moet uitsien. Ek wil  egter  ook
vir die agb Minister sê hy moet dan nie toelaat dat  sy  politieke  onderrok
uithang nie, want 'n verskuilde agenda is baie duidelik by die agb  Minister
te bespeur, wat daarop dui dat hy  wil  sien  dat  daar  nie  'n  Afrikaanse
akademiese instelling moet wees met Afrikaans as medium van onderrig nie.

As 'n oudstudent van die Potchefstroomse universiteit wil  ek  vir  die  agb
Minister sê die rektor skuil agter die rok van die  agb  Minister  deur  vir
die mense te sê dit is die Minister wat so besluit het  en  hulle  het  geen
keuse gehad nie. Dit is wat daar buite gesê word en die  agb  Minister  moet
kennis neem daarvan. Dankie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon Minister  comes  along
and he says that when we look at our academic  institutions,  they  must  be
institutions  of  intellect,  moral  values,  high  academic  standards  and
quality.

I want to tell the hon Minister that  the  FF  Plus  agrees  whole-heartedly
that this is what our academic institutions should be like. However, I  also
want to tell the hon Minister that he should  not  let  his  political  slip
show, because it is quite clear that  the  Minister  has  a  hidden  agenda,
which indicates that  he  wants  to  ensure  that  there  is  not  a  single
Afrikaans academic institution with Afrikaans as its medium of instruction.

As a former student of Potchefstroom University  I  want  to  tell  the  hon
Minister that the rector is  hiding  behind  the  hon  Minister  by  telling
people that it is the Minister  who  made  the  decision  and  they  had  no
choice. That is what is being said out there and the hon Minister must  take
cognisance of this. Thank you. [Interjections.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker and hon members, it  is  a  long  and  weary
road that the restructuring of higher education has travelled. We  have  had
instances in which some vice chancellors have  threatened  litigation  while
others were happy just to go  along  with  the  mergers.  It  is  normal  in
society to have acquiescers, laggards and those resistant to change.

The pilot project of studying with  some  universities  this  year  is  most
welcome. We look forward to the new-look North West University, the  Tshwane
University of Technology and the University of KwaZulu-Natal.  The  Minister
deserves praise for the humane manner in which he resolved the  problems  of
the Vice Chancellor of the University of Durban-Westville.  He  showed  real
leadership and did not go for the fall of the man whose  tenure  was  ending
anyway.

The recent disruption of classes at the  present  University  of  the  North
West calls for  a  thorough  investigation.  There  is  surely  some  unruly
element that is bent on upsetting the applecart? Much can be  said  for  and
against the omission of the Vista Sebokeng component from the original  plan
to have it attached to the University of the North West.

We call on the authorities at the institutions to  be  considerate  and  not
set their fees so  high  that  economically  disadvantaged  students  cannot
afford them. The universities should be centres of  excellence  in  teaching
and research so that the graduates who emerge from them should  be  men  and
women of substance.

The UCDP supports the statement on the transformation and  restructuring  of
higher education.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Deputy Speaker, the PAC would like to congratulate  the
Minister on the way he handled a very difficult transformation exercise.  We
believe that he should be congratulated because higher  education  reflected
the very artificial creation of institutions in our land, and this  was  not
really good for our country.

Having said that, I spent the past weekend in Umtata.  People  there  are  a
little bit anxious  about  the  transformation.  They  accept  it,  but  are
wondering whether they are going to be served,  whether  this  is  going  to
produce results in the Transkei, or whether the  people  there  will  really
develop. I believe that we need to be sensitive as far as that is  concerned
and ensure that this does happen.

We hope that the whole educational landscape will stabilise.  The  time  has
now come to reap the fruits, to begin to see the fruits,  of  education.  We
are hoping that  very  soon  Afrocentric  values  will  emerge,  Afrocentric
research will be done and that, on the whole, we will  begin  to  enjoy  the
fruits coming out of universities of which we can rightly be proud.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  MF  would  like  to  take  this
opportunity to compliment the department and our hon Minister  on  the  hard
work to educate our nation and improve education throughout South Africa.

The challenges in education  are  many  as  we  have  a  largely  illiterate
population, but this department, through education and skills training,  has
managed to make a great turnaround. The changes and  development  in  higher
education are supported and viewed as changes that will benefit our system.

It is encouraging to note the enthusiasm and  co-operation  of  role-players
in transforming higher education. We are especially pleased with the  merger
between the University of Natal and the University of  Durban-Westville.  We
thank  you,  hon  Minister,  and  those  working  under  you  for  the  fine
development and management of our education nationally.

The MF supports the transformation process.

Mr C AUCAMP:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Minister  said  that  the  whole
exercise requires us to balance different interests and needs. This did  not
happen.  Universities  with  different  cultures,  ethos,   languages,   and
characters were forced to merge, without balancing the different  interests.
Universities with proud histories were moved like pawns by the chess  master
on my right.

My own alma mater lost its name and its distinctive  "For  Christian  Higher
Education". The Minister makes much of diversity and  he  states  that,  "we
will not be bullied into uniform and one-dimensional  perspectives  of  what
universities mean", but at the  end  of  the  day  diversity,  and  this  is
something new in the eyes  of  the  ANC,  means  that  every  school,  every
university and every organisation should reflect  the  demographics  of  the
country. This is not diversity, because then everyone looks the  same.  This
is uniformity.

The NA does not share the Minister's excitement with his latest Big  Brother
move. I thank you.

Prof S M MAYATULA: Deputy Speaker and hon members, allow me,  on  behalf  of
the ANC Government, to thank the members who have come  here  to  appreciate
the difficult task that the education department has gone through  in  order
to reconstruct the university scene.

I would first like to respond briefly  to  the  comments  made  by  the  hon
Steele. Firstly, I think he is concerned about  the  quality  that  will  go
hand in hand with mergers. I think if he had gone through the  documentation
that has to do with this and how this quality has been  put  upfront  where,
through the CHE, this will be monitored on a day-to-day basis, he would  not
have said what he has just said.

As far as credibility is concerned, I am not  sure  what  credibility  means
when we are trying to transform and bring South Africans together  to  share
in  this  new  country  we  are  building.  Hon  Steele  also  referred   to
massification. If he were to refer to current numbers and what is  happening
in our universities, compared to the depth that we have, I am sure again  he
would not be saying what he has been saying.

The right of dissent, I  think,  is  contained  in  our  Constitution  -  no
Minister, President or whoever will ever be able  to  refuse  anybody  that.
Again I think we need to sympathise with what happened,  as  shared  by  the
hon Dudley, about the postponement of lectures. I think that  that  must  be
taken in the spirit of change. When you are involved  in  big  changes  like
the ones that we have, surely things of that nature can be expected.

I want to believe  that  the  transformation  and  restructuring  of  higher
education is one of the greatest achievements of the ANC-led Government.  It
has literally turned the apartheid legacy upside-down. Who would  ever  have
thought that Potchefstroom University would even  have  thought  of  sharing
its resources with North West University, let alone come together  with  one
management to be able to drive all the programmes? Who on earth  would  ever
have thought of  the  University  of  Natal  accrediting  courses  from  the
University of Durban-Westville so that students are  able  to  move  without
any problems? What other magical formula could have been  used  to  see  the
students of Pentech and the students of  Cape  Technikon  working  together,
using all those resources in order to be groomed to be the students that  we
want?

For the first time, courses between universities are going to  be  portable.
Many of us have come across students who lack only one course. Because  they
did this one course at this particular university  and  they  happen  to  be
attending another university now, they cannot do the same course. They  have
to go back to the first  university  for  the  whole  year.  I  can  give  a
practical  example:  I  have  two  students  doing  Economics  III  at   the
University of Fort Hare. The external examiner is  from  the  University  of
Port Elizabeth. He examines, moderates, does all sorts  of  things,  but  if
that student dares to fail, there is no way he would be in a position to  do
that course in Port Elizabeth, if he happens to  work  there.  But,  through
this portability, all that will change.

Again a number of students have  been  frustrated  because  they  have  been
unable to change and share courses. If one glances at the  mandate  and  the
MTBP, one can also see that the ANC Government is ready  to  put  its  money
where its mouth is. As the Minister  has  rightly  said,  sums  of  money  -
billions and billions of rands - have been set aside  in  order  to  finance
this programme.

The new funding formula framework will encourage  improvement  and  it  will
also encourage graduation-linked funding. That means for now  we  are  going
to pay for more of our people going through, as a sum of  about  R80 million
has been allocated to assist those students who are unable to adapt  in  the
higher institutions and this is going to assist our people  and  change  the
quality.

Hon Mfundisi is concerned about fees. I think I must be upfront again  about
one of the best options out there which  says:  If  the  University  of  the
North-West is merged with Potchefstroom and the fees  at  Potchefstroom  are
R20 and the fees at North West were R10, suddenly those students  are  going
to have to find an extra R10 somewhere.  The  Government  is  serious  about
these matters. It is going to assist those  students  so  that  this  merger
does not affect them negatively. Some of the programmes of this  merger  are
going to change, in a sense.

I would like to borrow just one paragraph from the CHE. When they put  their
presentation before our committee on 11 November, this is what they said:
  In the South African context where the real past is in danger in the face
  of either amnesia or the tendency to invest in institutional histories in
  the service of immediate ends of institutional survival, it is  important
  to restate the real past.

They went on to say that the inherited education system was designed in  the
main to reproduce, in teaching and research, white and male  privilege,  and
black and female subordination in all spheres of  society.  And,  they  said
that the one vitally important imperative and  challenge  was  to  transform
our education so that it  became  more  socially  equitable  internally  and
promoted  social,  equitable  and  more   general   aspects   by   providing
opportunities  for  social  advancement  through  equity   of   access   and
opportunity.

Previous research and  teaching  were  extensively  shaped  by  the  social,
economic  and  political  priorities  of   apartheid-supported   development
programmes. Instead, higher education  is  now  called  on  to  address  and
become responsive to the development needs of a  domestic  South  Africa.  I
thank you.

Debate concluded.

      CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON PREVENTION AND COMBATING OF CORRUPT
                               ACTIVITIES BILL


Report adopted without debate.

             PREVENTION AND COMBATING OF CORRUPT ACTIVITIES BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam  Deputy
Speaker, thanks very much. The Bill before  this  House  today,  namely  the
Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Bill, reflects  international
best practice and legislation dealing with the prevention and  combating  of
corruption and related corrupt activities.

The  Bill  provides  for,  amongst  other   things,   the   following:   The
strengthening of measures to  prevent  and  combat  corruption  and  corrupt
activities; the creation of the general offence of corruption  and  offences
relating  to  corrupt  activities;  investigative  measures  in  respect  of
corruption  and  related   corrupt   activities;   the   establishment   and
endorsement of a register in order to place certain restrictions on  persons
and enterprises convicted of corrupt  activities  relating  to  tenders  and
contracts; it places a  duty  on  certain  persons  holding  a  position  of
authority to report  certain  corrupt  transactions;  and  it  provides  for
extraterritorial jurisdiction in respect of the offence  of  corruption  and
offences relating to corrupt activities.

For this Government, the  Bill  represents  a  radical  departure  from  the
existing  provisions  relating  to  corruption  contained  in  the   current
Corruption Act  of  1992.  Noteworthy  in  this  regard  are  the  following
provisions: Firstly, clause 10, which  aims  at  replacing  the  common  law
crime of bribery, prohibits  the  receiving  and  offering  of  unauthorised
gratification by or to a person who is party to an employment  relationship.
Whereas the common law crime of bribery  only  applies  to  persons  in  the
public sector, the offence in clause 10 aims at  also  applying  to  persons
who are party to an employment relationship in the private sector.

Secondly, in terms of clause 17(1),  any  public  officer  who  acquires  or
holds a private interest in any contract, agreement or investment  emanating
from or connected with the public body in which he or she  is  employed,  or
which is made on account of that public body, is guilty of an offence.  This
offence does not apply, amongst others, to a public officer who acquires  or
holds such  interest  as  a  shareholder  of  a  listed  company,  or  whose
conditions of employment do not  prohibit  him  or  her  from  acquiring  or
holding such an interest.

Thirdly, clause 23 provides for the application by the National Director  of
Public Prosecutions and the issuing  of  an  investigation  direction  by  a
judge in respect  of  the  possession  of  property  disproportionate  to  a
person's present or past loan resources, or sources of income or assets.

Following the issuing of an investigation direction, the  national  director
has the following powers: He or she may summon  the  suspect  or  any  other
person specified in the investigation direction who is believed to  be  able
to  furnish  any  information  relating  to  the  property  in  his  or  her
possession or under his or her control to appear before him  or  her,  or  a
person authorised thereto, at a time and place  specified  in  the  summons,
and to be questioned or to produce that property. He  or  she  may  question
that suspect or other person under  oath  or  affirmation,  and  examine  or
retain, for further examination or safe custody, such property.

He or she may enter any premises where the suspect is, or  is  suspected  to
be, and there inspect  and  search  the  premises,  examine  and  seize  any
property found on the premises which has a bearing on the  investigation  in
question. Any person who  refuses  or  fails  to  give  any  information  or
explanation when required to do so in  terms  of  the  above  provisions  is
guilty of an offence and liable to a fine or to imprisonment  for  a  period
not exceeding 10 years.

Fourthly, chapter 6  of  the  Bill  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a
register for tender defaulters. This register is established in  the  office
of the National Treasury. In terms of clause 28 a court may, in  respect  of
an accused who has been  found  guilty  in  respect  of  corrupt  activities
relating to tenders  and  contracts,  in  addition  to  imposing  any  other
sentence, issue an order in terms of which the particulars of the  convicted
person or enterprise must be endorsed on the register. This may include  the
endorsement of enterprises, partners, managers  and  directors  involved  in
the commission of the offence.

Furthermore, the National Treasury may, or must as the case  may  be,  where
the register has been so endorsed, impose certain  restrictions  in  respect
of the persons or enterprises so endorsed. This  includes:  the  termination
of an agreement; the determination of a period of between  5  and  10  years
for  which  the  endorsement  must  remain  on   the   register;   and   the
disqualification relating to future tenders and contracts.

Clause 34 creates a duty to report certain  corrupt  transactions.  However,
it is important to note that this duty only applies to a  person  holding  a
position of authority as defined in the Bill. The duty  only  applies  where
such a person knows, or ought reasonably to have known, or  suspected,  that
certain  serious  offences  have  been  committed,  and  where  the  offence
involves an amount of R100 000 or more.

Importantly, I am proud to say that South Africa has, within  two  years  of
the adoption of the Southern African Development Community Protocol  Against
Corruption  on  14  August  2001,  succeeded  in  drafting,  accepting   and
approving legislation in compliance with the objectives of the protocol.  In
some instances, as mentioned, the Bill goes well beyond what is required  by
the protocol. Needless to say the enactment of this  Bill  will  ensure  our
country's compliance with the United Nations' Convention Against  Corruption
that was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 31 October this year.

Last but not least, the Bill,  once  enacted,  will  constitute  a  critical
component of a panel of legal instruments the Government uses in  its  fight
against crime, in particular organised crime and corruption. Some  of  these
legal  instruments  are  the  following:  The  numerous  amendments  to  the
Criminal Procedure Act that were adopted in 1995 and 1997  which  strengthen
our bail laws; the provision for the  imposition  of  minimum  sentences  in
respect of certain serious offences including corruption that  was  actually
effected in 1997; the approval by Parliament in 1998 of  the  Prevention  of
Organised Crime Act  to  prevent  and  combat  crime,  money-laundering  and
criminal  gain  activities;  the  enactment   in   1996   of   the   Special
Investigating Units and Special Tribunals Act in order to create  mechanisms
through  which  allegations  of  serious  corruption,  maladministration  or
misappropriation of state funds can be investigated; and  the  enactment  in
1998 of the National  Prosecuting  Authority  Act  which  provides  for  the
establishment of a single, national prosecuting authority.

In the year 2000 this Act was amended to provide for the establishment of  a
Directorate of Special Operations, popularly known as  the  Scorpions,  with
the aim to investigate crime committed in an organised fashion. In 2000  the
Protected Disclosures Act was enacted in order  to  provide  protection  for
persons who disclose information relating to criminal or  irregular  conduct
in their places of work.

In 2002 the Regulation of Interception of Communications  and  Provision  of
Communication-related Information Act was enacted  in  order  to  bring  the
legislation dealing with the interception and monitoring  of  communications
into line with the latest communication technologies. I  must  also  mention
that my colleague, the Minister for the Public Service  and  Administration,
has introduced various comprehensive administrative  measures  in  order  to
prevent and combat corruption in the public sector.

We can thus proclaim, without any  fear  of  contradiction,  that  with  the
enactment of this Bill we will have in place a comprehensive  and  well  co-
ordinated anticorruption plan.  However,  it  is  axiomatic  that  a  proper
anticorruption strategy, a correct  anticorruption  plan,  intelligence  and
appropriate  legislation,  and  rigorous  law  enforcement  are  in  and  of
themselves not adequate. As  corruption  is  frequently  a  product  of  the
culture of a society, a change in the culture is necessary  and  can  indeed
be achieved through, among  other  things,  proactive  work,  education  and
training. We can win the war against corruption only  if  we  have  the  co-
operation of all.
Finally, I wish to thank  the  Chairperson  and  members  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Justice and Constitutional Development  for  their  hard  work.
They have, after many days of deliberation, produced  an  excellent  product
which I am sure will strengthen the hands of the criminal justice system  in
preventing and combating corruption and related activities. I thank you.

Adv J  H  DE  LANGE:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,  hon
members, ladies and gentlemen and the hon Mr Ellis, I rise on behalf of  the
ANC  in  unconditional  support  of  the  adoption  of  the  Prevention  and
Combating of Corrupt Activities  Bill  and  commend  its  adoption  to  this
House.

I start with a few thank you's; firstly, to all the parties. It has  been  a
long road. I think we have done sterling work at the end of the road and  we
can be proud of the work that we have done. To those parties that have  been
involved, that have been able to unanimously agree to this  Bill,  I  say  a
big thank you. Secondly, I say a big thank you to Mr  Gerard  Nel,  who  has
spent many days of his life down in Cape Town, when  he  could  surely  have
been up in Pretoria spending his time there more fruitfully.

Our President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, has consistently been in  the  forefront
of our Government and the ANC's war against corruption.  The  President  has
vociferously,  consistently  and  unequivocally  denounced   any   form   of
corruption. He  has  also  propagated  a  zero-tolerance  approach  to  such
deviant and  destructive  behaviour,  urging  and  supporting  the  vigorous
ferreting out, prosecution and incarceration of such deviants.

The President's response in the House yesterday on issues of corruption  has
again confirmed this uncompromising approach. A cursory glance over some  of
our President's pronouncements  over  the  last  few  years  on  this  issue
further contextualises this approach. I remind the nation of some  of  these
details. On 10 October 1999, the President opined:


  We must therefore conclude that corruption is a social phenomenon. In our
  own national case we would make bold to say that  a  basic  factor  which
  informs corruptive practice is the disjuncture that has occurred  between
  spiritual and material  human  needs.  It  seems  clearer  that  in  that
  contest, the material has assumed precedence over the spiritual. In  many
  instances, material values have gained their greater worth in the eyes of
  many people at the expense of spiritual values.


  In this situation, success in the accumulation of material values becomes
  acceptable within our social value system as a pre-eminent goal to pursue
  and a pre-eminent criterion by which to judge as to whether  the  citizen
  is  a  successful  person  or  a  failure.  Necessarily,  this  level  of
  deification of material values downgrades the importance of the  question
  of how these material values are acquired. The important thing is to have
  and to be known to have and not to question, how did you come to  possess
  what you possess.

In a similar vein, on an earlier occasion on 10 November 1998, he said:


  Since any Government is born of the society it seeks to govern, it  will,
  to a good extent, be a mirror image of and a reflection of the  prevalent
  levels of morality. In  the  macrocontext  of  world  values,  where  the
  private accumulation of material wealth is unleashed, a  total  onslaught
  on every other determining value possible,  mental  conditioning  remains
  captive to the triumph of  the  stronger  flow  of  success  measured  as
  personal prosperity.


  That we as South Africans in all spheres of life have been  overtaken  by
  material self-seeking should therefore come as no surprise, even if  it's
  contrary to public interest and at the public expense. In this regard, it
  is incumbent on Government unequivocally to affirm  its  seriousness  and
  desire to stamp  out  corruption  wherever  it  occurs.  Perpetrators  of
  corrupt practice in both the public and private sectors will be  severely
  punished for contributing to this moral mayhem which has been allowed  to
  creep into the fabric of our society.


  Zero tolerance will be shown to  the  parasites  of  our  land  who  have
  scorned the public interest and sought their own self-enrichment  at  the
  state's expense. For it  is  against  them  and  against  the  antinomian
  culture they seek to perpetuate that  we  must  continually  rebel.  Such
  rebellion must of necessity take on  a  public  face,  for  collusion  of
  individuals in deviant behaviour contrary to the common good  is  usually
  cloaked in silence. Government is firmly committed to come  down  harshly
  against all forms of corruption, including bribery and  abuse  of  public
  trust.

I have quoted the President in some detail to highlight the unequivocal  and
uncompromising leadership he  has  consistently  provided  in  this  regard,
despite a few incorrect averments by some to the contrary. It has become  an
internationally accepted truism that corruption  undermines  ethical  values
and morality, democratic institutions and values, as well  as  the  rule  of
law, and disturbs the development priorities of a  country.  It  slows  down
sustainable economic  growth  and  jeopardises  sustainable  development  by
disrupting the distribution of scarce resources.

Corruption exists everywhere, but it does most harm  in  those  areas  where
resources are already limited. It obviously also undermines the  credibility
of governments and provides a fertile breeding ground for  organised  crime,
ultimately endangering the stability and the security of societies.  Corrupt
actions in all spheres of life, especially  by  public  officials,  are  not
countenanced by any country, at  least  not  publicly,  if  that  government
wishes to retain its authority to enforce the law.

What exactly is corruption? The US scholar Hanning cogently deals with  this
issue fully in his scholarly work,  from  which  I  borrowed  liberally.  He
points out that there is no single definition of  corruption  and  the  term
has described everything from  blatant  acts  of  bribery,  to  the  use  of
political power to advance personal and party agendas.  While  every  nation
has criminalised the bribing of government officials, bribery  is  only  one
manifestation of corruption. Criminal law is not the only means  to  inhibit
corruption. Many nations have also adopted  ethical  guidelines  for  public
administration  and  regulations  on  campaign   finances   to   limit   the
opportunity to misuse and  improperly  influence  public  authority.  A  few
nations have even tried  to  introduce  such  ethical  guidelines  into  the
private sphere of life.

The issue of corruption has become one of  the  leading  matters  exercising
the collective mind  of  the  international  community.  Many  nations  have
worked at the international level to enhance the fight against all forms  of
corruption wherever it's found - especially public corruption - through  the
adoption of multilateral agreements, requiring the  signatory  countries  to
adopt tougher domestic criminal laws on all forms of  corruption  to  punish
both abusers of public authority and abusers within the  private  sphere.  A
case in point is the pending signing by the international community  at  the
end of this year of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.

Corruption is not a term acceptable to  easy  definition.  In  the  criminal
law, the fundamental form of corruption is bribery.  Judge  Noonan  captures
it as follows, and I quote:


  The  core  of  the  concept  of  a  bribe  is  an  inducement  improperly
  influencing the performance of a public function meant to be gratuitously
  exercised.

Every definition of corruption incorporates bribery as  the  principle  form
of misconduct and then usually seeks  to  expand  the  concept  to  cover  a
broader array of conduct. Another scholar  cogently  described  the  problem
with drafting laws, which  we  also  found  in  this  case,  to  criminalise
corruption beyond bribery as follows, and I quote:


  The crime of bribery is the black core of a series of concentric  circles
  representing the degrees of impropriety into official behaviour. In  this
  conception, a series of grey circles  around  the  bribery  core  growing
  progressively lighter as they become more distant from the centre,  until
  they blend into the surrounding white which represents  perfectly  proper
  and innocent conduct.

Adding to the difficulty in defining corruption is the absence  of  reliable
measures of its pervasiveness beyond general perceptions that  a  government
or a Ministry is corrupt. Relying  solely  on  conduct  that  constitutes  a
criminal violation  will  not  demonstrate  whether  corruption  is  rampant
because the misconduct is so  difficult  to  detect  that  conviction  rates
provide little insight into the scope of the problem.  Moreover,  corruption
in many instances occurs without a victim. At least in the common  sense  of
that term it is a person, not a party to  the  violation,  who  suffers  the
effect of a crime and who may report it to the authorities.

The hallmarks of corruption are stealth and obfuscation between  extensively
co-operating parties, and the pursuit of criminal cases can be  hampered  by
the involvement of offenders who possess a good reputation and  high  social
standing. Corruption  is  certainly  among  the  most  difficult  crimes  to
investigate and prosecute successfully. To elaborate further on this  point:
although corruption is not a victimless crime per se,  unlike  most  crimes,
the victim is often not easily identifiable.  Usually,  those  involved  are
beneficiaries in some way and have an interest in preserving secrecy.

Clear evidence of the actual payment of a bribe can  be  exceptionally  hard
to  obtain  and  corrupt  practices  frequently   remain   unpunished.   The
traditional  methods  of  evidence  gathering  will  often   not   lead   to
satisfactory  results.  Additional  laws  are  needed,  providing  for  more
innovative evidence-gathering procedures such as integrity testing,  amnesty
regulations for those involved in the  corrupt  transaction,  whistle-blower
protection, the abolition and/or limiting of enhanced  bank,  corporate  and
professional secrecy, money-laundering and access to information statutes.

Therefore, it can be concluded that corruption is  an  expanding  and  quite
flexible concept. Efforts to adopt new criminal laws to address the  broader
concerns about  official  misconduct,  therefore,  should  move  beyond  the
bribery paradigm as a predominant  form  of  corruption.  A  law,  unlike  a
scholarly  definition,  must  state  the  elements  of  the   offence   with
sufficient  precision  to  inform  those  subject  to  its  strictures  what
criminal conduct is and what penalties they may incur for a violation.

The broader the scope of the law, the greater the possibility that  arguably
acceptable conduct will come within the criminal  provision  and  result  in
punishment for acts that are not morally blameworthy. How has this  approach
been adopted and incorporated in the drafting of  our  corruption  Bill?  My
colleagues and my comrades will, in the next few  hours,  give  you  a  more
detailed overview on that. [Interjections.] Listen to  what  is  said  about
corruption. Don't worry or be so evasive about  this  one.  [Interjections.]
Listen well, if you want to hear, Sheila. It is not enough.  You  must  hear
the other side - the right side.

Let me tell you what our approach has been.  It's  been  international  best
practice to take the crime  of  corruption  and  unbundle  it,  firstly,  by
creating a general all-encompassing crime of corruption; and then, over  and
above that overall general crime of corruption, creating specific crimes  of
corruption within different spheres of  life.  Therefore,  we  have  created
further offences  specifically  for  public  officials  and  foreign  public
officials; for agents of the principal in certain instances; for members  of
the legislative authority - there are specific criminal offence for MPs,  so
you better be careful of what you do from now on;  for  the  judiciary;  and
for the prosecuting authority. Then we have created further offences in  the
area of trials in general, namely the  corruption  of  evidence  in  trials;
contracts; tendering processes; auctions; and  then  the  famous  Gibbs  and
Hansie Cronjé situation around sporting events, as  well  as  around  gaming
and gambling.

Then we also looked further at the crime of bribery. As you know,  in  1992,
this crime was repealed. There was a suggestion  that  it  should  again  be
incorporated in this legislation and be unrepealed, so  to  speak.  We  have
decided to do so, but not to do it as narrowly as in  the  past.  Therefore,
we have expanded the previous crime of bribery which only applied to  public
officials. We have also expanded  it  to  the  private  sector.   Therefore,
anyone in an employment relationship  -  whether  you  are  an  employer  or
employee - if you take any undue gratification for the work that you  should
be doing, henceforth, that will be a crime in terms of  clause  10  of  this
Bill.

Furthermore, there was a suggestion in connection  with  a  situation  where
persons  have  excessive  wealth.  We  have  looked  at  this  matter  quite
carefully. It is true that around the world,  crimes  like  that  are  being
created in some countries. Unfortunately the proponents of these crimes  are
usually in countries like Singapore,  which  do  not  necessarily  have  the
greatest human rights records.  As  far  as  we  are  concerned,  there  are
certain problems constitutionally and around the questions  of  desirability
to create such a crime.

What we did instead was that we did not go ahead and endorse the crime  that
was  created  in  the  legislation,  but  we  rather  created  a  particular
investigative mechanism whereby the prosecuting authority can  approach  the
courts and seek an investigation direction in a case where  they  feel  that
someone has excessive wealth. Therefore,  the  rule  of  law  will  run  its
course more carefully, in doing so.

I also want to mention  another  innovation  in  this  Bill.  The  Bill  was
introduced by creating a duty for public servants to report  every  instance
of corruption. We felt once again that it was an unbalanced way  of  looking
at things and that it was wrong not  to  treat  things  equally  within  the
private and public sectors. We have now created a duty at a  specific  level
within our  society  to  report  corruption.  What  we  have  done  is  that
regarding persons in positions of authority - certain civil  servants  above
a certain rank or, in the private sector, certain persons that  hold  senior
management positions - henceforth, there  would  be  a  duty  upon  them  to
report any form of corruption  amounting  to  more  than  R100  000  to  the
police. We have done so by trying to  create  capacity  around  this  issue.
Hopefully, in years to come, we will be able to create  a  more  generalised
duty for citizens to report all corruption in this country.

We obviously hope that this will put an end to those golden handshakes  that
are given to people,  particularly  in  the  top  echelons  of  the  private
sector. As soon as corruption is found amongst them, the way that  they  get
rid of the person is not to prosecute and not to make  such  matters  known,
but to actually give a golden handshake. My  colleagues  and  comrades  will
deal with some of the other relevant issues in the Bill. Can  I  just  thank
everyone for listening and, once  again,  for  unanimously  supporting  this
Bill. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: The DA has no hesitation in supporting this Bill.  In  fact
we have been agitating to  beef  up  our  anticorruption  legislation  since
February 2001, when we  introduced  in  Parliament  three  Private  Members'
Bills to amend the 1992 Corruption Act. We are happy to  say  that  most  of
our suggestions have been incorporated in this Bill.

As far as I am aware, all parties who participated in the  committee's  work
unanimously support the Bill. Only the hon De Lille, who was never  seen  in
the committee and is not participating in the debate today and is  not  even
in this House - she very seldom is - has told the media that she is  against
the Bill, unaccountably.

Corruption in the public sector and, to some extent, in the private  sector,
is rife in our country  and  is  in  danger  of  really  becoming  systemic.
Corruption seems to permeate all the way  to  the  top,  unfortunately.  The
allegation of corruption against the Deputy President now before our  courts
is a huge embarrassment to our country. We accept that the Deputy  President
must be regarded as innocent until proven  guilty,  but  a  public  document
before our courts establishing a prima facie case of corruption against  him
is a dreadful situation.

The ruling party clearly has a huge credibility problem around the issue  of
corruption. The Shaikh tentacles have also reached another high-profile  ANC
figure in the person of the former Transport Minister, Mr Mac  Maharaj,  who
is also under investigation by the  Scorpions  for  transactions  linked  to
Shaikh. Then there  are  the  fraud  and  corruption  cases  against  Winnie
Mandela and Tony Yengeni.

Moving away from personalities, just a few striking  examples  of  currently
alleged corruption in Government  institutions  indicate  the  size  of  the
problem.  Recently,  the   Justice   department   called   for   a   special
investigation authorised by the President into  the  disappearance  of  more
than  R100 million  in  fines,  maintenance  and  bail  money  held  by  the
department. The Road Accident Fund may have  wasted  R61 million  last  year
with the fund's audit committee  detailing  35  serious  irregularities  and
contraventions of the Public Finance Management Act. There  is  the  ongoing
R7 million Land Bank fraud trial. New Home Affairs  Director-General,  Barry
Gilder, has just gone  on  record  that  corruption  in  his  department  is
widespread and even endemic. Transnet is investigating  corruption  involved
in a R53 million Spoornet contract. Then there  are  the  goings-on  at  the
University of Durban-Westville, the fraud in the Golden Arrow  bus  company,
and the driver's licence frauds unearthed in Limpopo and  Mpumalanga.  There
are reports of extensive corruption coming from all  provinces,  which  will
take far too long to detail.

I do not believe any member  of  this  House  needs  convincing  that  South
Africa needs a comprehensive anticorruption law, which  follows  the  modern
trend of international legislation by  unbundling  corruption  in  terms  of
which  various  specific  corrupt  practices  and   actions   are   defined,
prohibited and attract heavy sentences as well as the general definition  of
corruption in the Bill. As our chair in the portfolio committee has  pointed
out, a number of specifically defined corrupt activities are detailed,  such
as  those  relating  to  public  officers,  members   of   the   legislative
authorities, and  those  associated  with  legal  proceedings  such  as  the
judicial authority, the prosecuting authority, witnesses  and  then  foreign
public officials. The role of  agents  is  dealt  with  in  detail,  as  are
tenders, auctions,  contracts,  sporting  events,  gambling,  etc.  If  this
sounds like belt and braces, this was  the  intention  -  to  have  an  all-
embracing  comprehensive  statute  that  will  be  effective  in   combating
corruption in all quarters of human endeavour, whether public or private.

It also attempts to bring within its ambit all  those  from  the  public  or
private sectors who attempt corrupt activities, even if they do not  achieve
them. Spelling out these offences in detail should assist  the  prosecution.
For instance, many of the  allegations  in  the  Shaikh  and  Marais/Malatsi
trials, currently underway, have  a  direct  correlation  with  specifically
spelt-out offences in the Bill.

Three further innovative aspects are to be welcomed in the establishment  of
the tender defaulter's register, the incorporation  of  a  duty  on  persons
holding a position of authority  to  report  corrupt  transactions,  whether
known or suspected, and modelled on  similar  provisions  contained  in  the
Prevention of Organised Crime and Financial Intelligence  Centres  Act,  and
the requirement to explain sudden discrepancies  between  known  income  and
lifestyle.

Getting to this point was a stop-start  affair.  The  Bill  was  before  the
committee for over a year and a half. For a  while,  the  DA  had  questions
about the political will of the governing party to fight corruption  and  to
get the legislation passed. And, in this regard, it  is  worth  quoting  the
hon Minister for Justice and Constitutional Development at the  Government's
international anticorruption conference, held  in  Durban  four  years  ago,
when he said:


  The problem may not be the absence of clear national strategies.  It  may
  not even be the  paucity  of  resources  to  implement  such  plans.  The
  disturbing feature of most anticorruption campaigns has been the lack  of
  political will.

It  took  another  two  years  for  the  Cabinet  to  adopt   the   National
Anticorruption Strategy for the public sector and four years to  bring  this
comprehensive anticorruption legislation to Parliament.

Once it is passed, we hope the Government will put  adequate  resources  and
mechanisms behind the legislation to  ensure  effective  implementation.  It
has to be admitted that corruption  is  a  notoriously  difficult  crime  to
define, pursue and obtain convictions on. Few, if any, were  achieved  under
the 1992 legislation.

Dr De Kock of the SA Police Service's crime analysis centre,  responding  to
my request for statistics two days ago, indicated  that  figures  pertaining
to corruption are not readily available as  a  large  number  of  corruption
cases are registered under codes like theft and fraud.  Very  often,  as  in
the Yengeni case, the corruption charge is dropped in favour  of  getting  a
theft and fraud conviction. The Justice  committee  has  laboured  long  and
hard to ensure that, in future,  corruption  charges  will  stick.  All  the
major international statutes and the United  Nations  convention  have  been
consulted and, where possible, incorporated and, in  this  regard,  I  would
like to commend Advocate Gerard Nel for his dogged hard work.

Corruption manifests itself  in  various  forms,  the  chief  of  which  are
bribery,  embezzlement,  fraud,  extortion,  abuse  of  power,  conflict  of
interest, insider trading, favouritism and nepotism. This latter  aspect  is
one of the most difficult manifestations of corruption to  pin  down.  After
all, how far do you go in family relationships? This is perhaps one  of  the
few areas that is not adequately covered by this Bill.

The DA sincerely hopes that, armed with  this  legislation,  the  Government
will begin to win the fight against corruption. It will surely have no  more
excuses. It will also have an international obligation to stand  up  and  be
counted in the global battle against corruption once  the  Government  signs
the United Nations Convention Against  Corruption  in  December.  Thank  you
very much, Chair.

Mr M V NGEMA: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. Normally Mr  Vezi  and  Mr  Van
der Merwe would have spoken on this subject of the portfolio committee,  but
due to problems, they have not been able to be here.

First of all, I wish to state that the IFP  supports  the  Bill  before  the
House. I am not going to repeat what previous speakers have said as  we  all
agree on the Bill. It is common cause that South  Africa  is  struggling  to
prevent and combat corrupt  activities  and  that  we  need  legislation  to
effectively deal with it. Yes, there are many rumours  of  corruption.  Many
people are charged, convicted and sentenced, but still corruption is rife.

We in the IFP are of the  opinion  that  legislation  is  but  part  of  the
solution. In  addition  to  legislation,  prosecution  and  imprisonment  of
offenders,  South  Africa  needs  more.  What  we   also   need   is   moral
regeneration. Our country should seriously pull up its moral  socks.  Family
values should be treasured. Discipline at  home,  in  the  schools,  at  the
workplace, all over, should be brought back and enforced. Our country  needs
men and women to take the lead in our country's  moral  rehabilitation.  We,
as members of Parliament, should especially take lead.

In  conclusion,  no  law  alone  will  be  effective  enough  to  deal  with
corruption unless we have the moral capacity to sustain it. Only  then  will
we overcome corruption in South Africa. I thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, the hon V  Meruti,
who is going to  be  speaking  next,  will  be  making  her  maiden  speech.
[Applause.]

Ms V MERUTI: Deputy Chairperson, hon  members,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  the
report of the United Nations Office on  Drugs  and  Crime  and  the  Country
Corruption Assessment Report on behalf of the South African Government  have
been received by the Speaker of the National  Assembly,  Dr  Frene  Ginwala,
and  then  launched  by  her,  the  Minister  for  the  Public  Service  and
Administration - Comrade Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi -  and  a  representative
of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and their regional  officer
for Southern Africa - Mr Rob Boone.

There is express political will in South Africa to address this problem.  In
recent years the Government has taken several significant  steps,  not  only
to ensure a clean public administration  system,  but  also  to  signal  its
intention  to  be  responsive  to  local  and  international  pressure   and
encouragement towards good  governance  and  to  promote  greater  openness,
transparency and accountability.

About 80% of corruption cases  in  Government  reported  in  the  media  are
discovered by the ANC-led Government. [Applause.] South  Africa  contributes
actively and substantially  to  international  and  regional  anticorruption
efforts. The country is improving in terms of  legislation.  Several  pieces
of legislation's enforcement structures are unique in  the  region,  and  of
the highest international standards. South Africa is improving in  terms  of
increased  institutional  capacity  to  investigate  and  prosecute  corrupt
practices.

By international standards, South Africa belongs to the group  of  countries
that occupy a middle position regarding their vulnerability  to  corruption.
This  is  clearly  the  position  of  South  Africa  with  respect  to   the
Transparency International corruption perception.

Among developing countries, South Africa is perceived as one  of  the  least
corrupt, and as the developing country whose citizens are least  exposed  to
public  sector  corruption.  The  Prevention  and   Combating   of   Corrupt
Activities Bill seeks to  provide  for  the  strengthening  of  measures  to
prevent and  combat  corruption  and  corrupt  activities,  to  provide  for
investigative  measures  in  respect  of  corruption,  to  provide  for  the
establishment and endorsement of  a  register  in  order  to  place  certain
restrictions on persons and  enterprises  convicted  of  corrupt  activities
relating to tenders and contracts, and to place a duty  on  certain  persons
holding a position of authority to report certain corrupt transactions.

Since  1994,  the  ANC-led  Government  has  put   numerous   anticorruption
programmes and projects in place. I would like to  end  with  a  quote  from
President Mbeki's speech at the  National  Anticorruption  Summit  in  April
1999:


  If the religious leaders present amongst us will pardon me, I would  like
  to cite a number of verses from the King James version  of  the  Biblical
  book of Ecclesiastes in an effort  to  answer  the  question:  What  went
  wrong? "I sought in my mind how to give myself unto wine, yet  acquainted
  my heart with wisdom; ... I gathered me also  silver  and  gold  and  the
  peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and
  women  singers,  and  the  delights  of  the  sons  of  men,  as  musical
  instruments, and that of all sorts".

Obviously this text gives a vivid description of a very successful  resident
of Jerusalem who, through his labour,  has  all  the  material  things  that
every one of us would like to have, from wine to silver and  gold;  from  an
army of servants to inhouse musicians; and from  an  abundance  of  food  to
what is described as "the delights of the sons of men", yet  the  text  goes
on:


  Then I looked on all the works that my hands  had  wrought,  and  on  the
  labour that I had laboured  to  do:  and,  behold,  all  was  vanity  and
  vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.

It seems to me that this text correctly raises what is perhaps at the  heart
of the problem of corruption which we have to confront  -  the  relationship
within each human being and  each  society  between  the  material  and  the
spiritual.

All philosophies recognise the fact that  what  distinguishes  us  as  human
beings from other forms of animal existence, is that we have  both  material
and spiritual needs. Thus, the normal human being we would like to see,  and
to be, is a  person  who  succeeds  in  maintaining  the  necessary  balance
between these needs, between what  is  materially  necessary,  and  what  is
morally correct.

In many instances our society itself describes as successful, and as  people
to be emulated, those who are like the residents of Jerusalem  described  in
Ecclesiastes, those who have accumulated more  wealth  than  any  other  who
ever lived in that city. No questions are asked about the ethical  behaviour
of any of us as part of determining whether we should be  emulated  or  not.
Success is defined as success in having addressed effectively  the  material
needs of the human being. Therefore, our youth grow up knowing  that  to  be
deemed a success, one must possess the luxury cars  whose  brand  names  are
familiar to all of us, one must have a big expensive house and dress in  the
finest garments available on the market.

The issue of how these possessions are acquired is  immaterial.  Indeed,  to
have acquired them without having worked for them  is  itself  applauded  as
demonstrating ingenuity and  a  fleetness  of  foot  and  mind.  In  such  a
situation, to commit murder  to  advance  my  goal  of  accumulating  wealth
becomes permissible. To rob an old age pensioner  of  his  or  her  pension,
becomes but a mere means of reaching the  goal  of  self-enrichment  by  the
shortest route possible. To steal public resources is merely to do the  done
thing by taking advantage of the position you find yourself  in.  Access  to
these resources is by virtue of the fact that you happen to be  employed  in
the Public Service. To rape women and children is also to take advantage  of
an opportunity  to  gratify  what  is  described  in  Ecclesiastes  as  "the
delights of the sons of men".

What I am trying to say is that our society evolved in a manner  which  gave
rise to a  situation  in  which  a  disastrous  collapse  of  social  values
occurred, to be replaced by the notion that what is good is what  serves  my
individual material interest and pleasures. I believe that if we  were  able
to correctly answer the question regarding what  went  wrong,  we  would  be
halfway to finding the solution which would make it possible for all  of  us
to realise the common dream of creating a decent and  caring  human  society
of which all our people would be proud.

Yes, the ANC-led Government has programmes in place to better  our  country,
and we can win with the co-operation of all, including the  DA.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Deputy Chair,  may  I  first  of  all  commend  the  previous
speaker on an excellently prepared maiden speech. It  is  quite  clear  that
she will make a very valuable contribution to this House.

When I saw the speakers' list today I was very excited, because I thought  I
was going to see an old friend of mine again - the hon Koos van der Merwe  -
after not having seen him for quite some time.  But  the  IFP  speaker,  who
stood in for him - I also have to stand in for another  member  -  did  very
well.

The Roman orator and scholar Cicero once remarked, and I quote:


  Those who mean to take charge of the affairs  of  government  should  not
  fail to remember two of Plato's rules. Firstly,  keep  the  good  of  the
  people clearly in view so that, regardless of their  own  interest,  they
  will make their every action conform to  that.  Secondly,  care  for  the
  welfare of the whole body politic and do not serve the interests of  some
  one party to betray the rest, for the administration of  a  government  -
  like the office of a trustee - must be conducted for the benefit of those
  entrusted to one's care, not for that of those to whom it is entrusted.

The Bill before us today aims to promote and strengthen measures to  prevent
and  combat   corruption   more   effectively.   It   will   also   increase
accountability and proper management of public affairs and public  property.
Good governance  and  fighting  corruption  are  among  the  most  important
challenges facing any government.
The New NP last week proposed in the Gauteng legislature that a register  of
persons  involved  in  corruption  against  the  provincial  government   or
municipalities in Gauteng should be compiled. Therefore, we want to  propose
that drawing up a name and shame list should be considered  in  the  various
provinces. This will ensure that  the  perpetrators  cannot  continue  their
criminal activities elsewhere. Such  a  list  should  be  distributed  among
state departments, parastatals and municipalities for  consideration  before
employing people or awarding Government tenders or contracts. This list  can
be based on the well-known credit record  system  which  allows  appropriate
credit checks that protect the rights  of  individuals,  but  in  particular
also meet the requirements of good governance.

Korrupsie kan nie  uitgeroei  word  as  die  skuldiges  telkemale  stil-stil
verdwyn en hulle werk net op 'n ander plek voortsit nie. Die  swartlys  moet
nie slegs staatsamptenare wat oortree insluit  nie,  maar  ook  diegene  wat
amptenare  korrupteer  deur  omkopery   of   ander   vorme   van   onwettige
beïnvloeding.
Mense wat hulle skuldig maak aan omkopery, is skuldig aan 'n  baie  ernstige
misdaad. As daar nie omkopers is nie, kan amptenare nie omgekoop  word  nie.
Benewens kriminele vervolging, moet maatreëls  ingestel  word  om  seker  te
maak dat sulke staatsdiewe, hulle frontmaatskappye of  vennote  tot  in  die
spreekwoordelike derde en vierde  geslag  nie  weer  naby  'n  staatskontrak
toegelaat kan word nie.

Die Ontvanger van Inkomste speel ook 'n belangrike rol as bykomende  sanksie
in hierdie proses. Dit sal sorg dat die  opbrengs  van  korrupsie  teen  die
staat  nie  in  die  misdadigers  of  hulle  vennote  se  sakke   bly   nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Corruption cannot be eradicated if the  guilty  parties  quietly  disappear
time and time again, only  to  carry  on  their  activities  elsewhere.  The
blacklist should not only include public  servants  who  have  violated  the
law, but also those persons who corrupt officials by bribery or other  forms
of illegal influence.

People who commit bribery are guilty of a very serious crime. If  there  are
no  bribers,  officials  cannot  be  bribed.   In   addition   to   criminal
prosecution, measures should be implemented to ensure that  people  such  as
these who steal from the state, their front companies or partners  will  not
be allowed near a state contract  up  to  the  proverbial  third  or  fourth
generation.

The Receiver of Revenue also  plays  an  important  role  as  an  additional
sanction in this process. This will ensure that the  gains  from  corruption
against the state will not remain in the pockets of the criminals  or  their
partners.]

Those who are aware of corrupt practices and  refrain  from  reporting  them
should also  be  held  accountable.  South  Africa  has  to  keep  track  of
international  developments  with  regard  to  corruption   and   means   to
effectively combat it.

Legislation in  South  Africa,  such  as  the  Promotion  of  Administrative
Justice Act, provides a very good basis for this anticorruption  Bill.  This
Bill will further enhance a culture of clean  government  and  transparency.
It  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  investigating   and   prosecuting
corruption cases and, therefore, the New NP  supports  this  Bill.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Deputy Chair, hon Minister, may I first thank  the  House  for
its unanimous support of my nomination for  the  Magistrates  Commission.  I
shall do my best to represent the House and the best interests of  this  new
democracy on this commission and consider it a great honour.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The ACDP supports the tough new provisions  intended  to  combat  corruption
contained in this Bill. In view of the widespread corruption,  both  in  the
private and public spheres, there can be  no  doubt  that  a  comprehensive,
integrated and multidisciplinary approach is required.

As far back as 1400 BC Moses indicated: "We must not accept bribes, for  the
bribe blinds the eye of the wise and subverts the cause of those of you  who
are right."  Bribery  and  corruption  undermine  human  development  and  a
transition to stable democratic rule. They prop up illegitimate  regimes  as
corporations bid for contracts by bribing. Wealthy nations are  wakening  up
to this and criminalising the practice of bribing foreign public  officials.
Similar provisions are contained in this Bill. However, such  measures  must
be  combined  with  stringent   domestic   anticorruption   strategies.   If
corruption is not addressed,  the  risk  of  investing  private  capital  in
economies, perceived to be highly corrupt, is further increased.

We support the provisions relating to blacklisting of persons  or  companies
found  guilty  of  tendering  for  contracts  corruptly,  as  well  as   the
provisions relating to the duty on persons in authority  to  report  corrupt
transactions. Whilst we are  also  in  broad  agreement  with  most  of  the
provisions, we agree that more attention needs to be given  to  address  the
serious problem of nepotism  whereby  family  and  friends  of  high-ranking
Government officials are awarded state contracts.

What  South  Africa,  however,  ultimately  requires  is  a  restoration  of
conscience, of morality. A corruption-free society can only  be  created  by
virtuous people whose individual consciences guard their behaviour and  hold
them accountable. Without conscience a society can be held in check only  by
coercion. Even coercion ultimately fails,  for  there  is  no  police  force
large  enough  to  keep  an  eye  on  every  individual.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, die Wetsontwerp  op  die  Voorkoming
van Korrupsie word werklik verwelkom deur die VF  Plus,  en  ons  steun  die
wetsontwerp.

Maar ek wil vir die agb Minister sê daar is 'n Engelse  spreekwoord  wat  sê
"the proof of the pudding is in the eating". Ons kom hier na  die  Parlement
en ons maak wetsontwerpe, maar as dit by die  uitvoering  daarvan  kom,  sit
ons met 'n bepaalde probleem. As ons sê ons wil 'n  wet  op  die  voorkoming
van korrupsie hê, en dat hy streng toegepas moet  word,  moet  die  boodskap
wat ons na die publiek uitstuur 'n boodskap wees wat sê ons is streng.

Ek moet vandag vir u sê die boodskap na buite is dat die  Regering  van  die
dag sag is op korrupsie. En hoekom sê ek dit? Die boodskap is daar word  nie
regtig streng opgetree nie, want as ons in  die  media  kyk,  lees  ons  van
staatsamptenare wat korrupsie gepleeg het, maar  wat  net  weer  herontplooi
word. Of ons lees van staatsamptenare wat korrupte aktiwiteite gepleeg  het,
en wat al twee jaar wag vir 'n saak om afgehandel te  word,  wat  hoë  poste
met hoë salarisse behou  -  belastingbetalers  se  geld  -  en  dan  is  die
boodskap wat uitgaan: ons is eintlik maar sag op korrupsie.

Ek wil vir die agb Minister sê die VF steun hierdie  wetsontwerp,  maar  dan
moet ons ook in die praktyk daadwerklik streng  teen  hierdie  mense  optree
sodat die boodskap wat ons na buite uitstuur 'n boodskap is om te sê ons  is
ernstig met dit wat ons doen hier in die  hoogste  Raadsaal  van  die  land.
Dankie, Voorsitter. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)
[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, the Prevention and Combating of  Corrupt
Activities Bill is really welcomed by the  FF  Plus,  and  we  support  this
Bill.

But I want to tell the hon Minister that there  is  an  English  idiom  that
goes "the proof of the pudding is in the eating". We come to Parliament  and
pass Bills, but when it comes  to  implementing  them  we  have  a  specific
problem. When we say we want an Act on the  prevention  of  corruption,  and
that it should be enforced strictly, the message we send out to  the  public
must be that we are strict.

I must tell you today that the message going out is that the  Government  of
the day is soft on corruption. And why am I  saying  this?  The  message  is
that no really strict action is taken, because if we look at the  media,  we
read  about  public  servants  who  committed  corruption,  who  are  simply
redeployed. Or we read about public servants  who  are  engaged  in  corrupt
activities, and have been waiting for two years for a case to  be  resolved,
who retain high posts with high salaries - taxpayers' money - and  then  the
message that goes out is: We are actually soft on corruption.

I want to tell the hon Minister that the FF supports this Bill, but then  we
must also in practice take strong action against these people  so  that  the
message we send out is that we are serious about what we are doing  here  in
the highest Chamber of the country. Thank you, Chairperson.]

Mr M T MASUTHA: Deputy Chairperson, hon members, comrades, I must  also  add
my voice in expressing appreciation for the wonderful inputs that have  been
made this afternoon, especially the input on moral regeneration  by  Comrade
Meruti in her maiden speech.

The Bill before us today, which is the product of painstaking  work  of  the
Justice committee and especially its chairperson, Comrade Johnny  de  Lange,
with the support of a dedicated team of departmental  drafters,  is  finally
being considered by  this  Parliament  before  the  end  of  its  term.  The
introduction  of  this  legislation  by  the   ANC-led   Government   is   a
manifestation - and even the DA had to acknowledge this  -  of  how  serious
the ANC is about sniffing out and uprooting all forms of corrupt  behaviour,
wherever and in whatever form  it  occurs  within  Government,  the  private
sector and society in general.

At it's 51st national conference  held  in  Stellenbosch  in  December  last
year, the ANC noted, amongst the resolutions it took, and I quote:


  Corruption is a social scourge that cuts across the  public  and  private
  sectors and society at large and involves a transaction between at  least
  the giver and the receiver.


  Corruption and unethical  conduct  pose  a  major  challenge  within  the
  public, private and  civil  sectors,  and  that  wherever  it  occurs  it
  undermines  the  values  and  objectives  of  the   national   democratic
  revolution.

It further noted, and I quote:


  Government has enacted legislation, such as the Public Finance Management
  Act and Protected Disclosures  Act,  which  protect  whistle-blowers,  to
  limit the areas in which corruption can take place, and is in the process
  of passing further legislation necessary to combat corruption.

The President, as many have already mentioned before me, has  on  more  than
one occasion in this House alluded to the important point that most  of  the
corruption, about 80%, that comes into the public domain is uncovered  as  a
result of Government initiatives to investigate and prosecute suspects  both
within and outside of Government  itself.  Further,  in  virtually  all  his
state of the nation addresses, the President has, since he  took  office  in
1999,  announced  various  initiatives  taken  by   Government   to   tackle
corruption.

In his 2002 address, for example, the President had the  following  to  say,
and I quote:


  In  accordance  with  the  Government's  comprehensive   Public   Service
  anticorruption strategy, we have introduced measures to ensure  that  the
  code of conduct is upheld, and  that  all  Public  Service  managers  are
  subject  to  conflict  of  interest  disclosures.  To  complement   this,
  legislation to fight corruption will be brought before Parliament  during
  this session.

Indeed, we are today considering that legislation which,  although  it  took
so long  to  complete  owing  to  the  complexity  and  illusive  nature  of
corruption, is one of the most precious gifts that could not have come at  a
better time than now, on the eve of the celebration of our first  decade  of
democracy as a free nation.

The ANC's 10-year review document, under the heading "Fighting  Corruption",
outlines some of the numerous anticorruption programmes  and  projects  that
have been put in place by the new Government since 1994. These  include  the
establishment in March 1997, by the government sectors responsible  for  the
SA National Crime Prevention Strategy, NCPS, of  a  programme  committee  to
work on corruption in the criminal justice system itself.
A fundamental point of departure in contextualising this challenge  is  that
corruption is a scourge that erodes the gains  that  we  have  made  in  our
transition as a people from the repressive,  immoral  and  corrupt  rule  of
apartheid that indulged in, and was sustained through, the  vices  of  bias,
exclusion, clandestine dealings, deceit, brutality and all  other  forms  of
humiliation against our people, to an open and democratic society  based  on
the  values  of  freedom,  equality  and  human  dignity  enshrined  in  our
Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

In order to safeguard  these  gains,  the  Constitution  has  in  Chapter  9
further created  state  institutions  supporting  constitutional  democracy,
which include  the  Public  Protector,  the  Human  Rights  Commission,  the
Auditor-General, etc, as independent institutions accessible to  the  public
and protected under the Constitution itself. Yesterday, in his  reply  to  a
question  posed  to  him,  for  example,  the  President   alluded   to   an
investigation by these institutions into alleged irregularities in the  arms
deal that was requested  by  this  House,  the  report  of  which  is  often
downplayed by  the  official  opposition,  especially  because  it  did  not
produce an outcome that suited its political goals.

The opposition must grow up and learn that democracy is  not  about  finding
people guilty of things they have not been  proven  to  be  guilty  of  just
because the opposition says so. After all,  we  have,  over  and  above  the
institutions I have just alluded  to,  independent  courts  which  have  the
power to decide whether a person has committed an offence or not.

Turning to the substance of the Bill itself, let me start  by  stating  that
unlike its predecessor, the Corruption Act  of  1992,  this  Bill  adopts  a
targeted approach to corruption by above all creating a general  offence  of
corruption, identifying the various  areas  in  which  corruption  manifests
itself, with all its ever-elusive characteristics, and, in a  very  detailed
and careful way, dealing with it so as to  maximise  the  net  within  which
corrupt activities can be captured. There are  special  provisions  to  deal
specifically  with,  for  example,  evidence  in   legal   proceedings,   in
particular  witnesses  and  evidential  material;  provisions  relating   to
procuring and withdrawal of tenders, auctions, contracts,  sporting  events,
gambling and games of chance.

The common law crime of bribery is at the heart of what is  referred  to  as
corruption. This  crime,  however,  is  generally  understood  only  in  the
context of the abuse by public officials of their positions of advantage  to
benefit themselves by entering  into  shady  deals,  usually  involving  the
private sector and members of the general public. Because  these  deals  are
often clinched under a veil of secrecy, it is often  difficult  to  identify
them or to prove their  occurrence,  hence  the  need  for  a  sophisticated
instrument, such as the Bill before us, to match up to the daunting task  of
sniffing out these corrupt activities.

The Bill also provides for  the  establishment  of  a  register  for  tender
defaulters. This register is established  in  the  office  of  the  National
Treasury. In terms of clause 28, a court may, in respect of an  accused  who
has been  found  guilty  of  corrupt  activities  relating  to  tenders  and
contracts, in addition to imposing any other sentence,  issue  an  order  in
terms of which the particulars of the convicted person  or  enterprise  must
be  endorsed  in  the  register.  This  may  include  the   endorsement   of
enterprises, partners, managers and directors involved in the commission  of
the offence.

Furthermore, the National Treasury may or must, as the case  may  be,  where
the register has been so endorsed, impose certain  restrictions  in  respect
of the person or enterprise so endorsed. This includes  the  termination  of
an agreement, the determination of a period between five and  10  years  for
which the endorsement must remain on the register, and the  disqualification
relating to future tenders and contracts.

The Bill further creates the duty to report  certain  corrupt  transactions.
It is important that this duty only applies to persons who hold  a  position
of authority as defined in the Bill.  Furthermore,  the  duty  only  applies
where such a person knows or ought reasonably to  have  known  or  suspected
that certain serious offences have been committed,  and  where  the  offence
involves an amount of R100 000 or more.

Let me conclude by stating that corruption is a thief that steals  from  the
poor by eroding  the  meagre  public  resources  that  Government  has  made
available to them and giving to those who are greedy and wish to reap  where
they did not sow. The challenge, therefore, is for all of us to  assist  the
various institutions, both in Government and in  the  private  sector,  that
seek  to  uproot  corruption  by  volunteering  information  about   corrupt
activities and the  culprits  behind  them.  We  must  use  the  tools  that
Government has provided us with to fight this scourge, and not  merely  fold
our arms and wait for some angel to do it for us.

The ANC views this Bill as being a critical step  in  the  pursuit  of  that
noble goal of creating a better life for all. Therefore we support the  Bill
wholeheartedly. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson,  hon  members,  Edward  Biggon  wrote,  and  I
quote, "The laws of a nation  form  the  most  instructive  portion  of  its
history." This is relevant to the South African  situation.  Posterity  will
come to learn from laws such as this one that corruption was  once  rife  in
our country. A responsible nation will not sit down with a tear or  a  frown
in the face of all that, hence  the  effort  to  paddle  our  own  canoe  by
unbundling corruption, as we are doing.

The Bill creates offences  in  respect  of  specific  persons,  and  in  the
interest of time, I shall confine myself to public officers. As  defined  in
the Bill, it refers to public servants and  to  members  of  Parliament,  of
provincial legislatures and of municipal councils.

According to the Bill, in so far  as  it  affects  public  officers,  it  is
improper for them to vote at public meetings. This implies  that  people  in
the Public Service, as contemplated in section 8(1) of  the  Public  Service
Act, Act 103 of 1994, have to know where and what to do and how to do it.
Failing to perform and not performing one's official  duties  adequately  is
corruption in itself. Such clots in the system block  the  free  circulation
and may cause thrombosis, and have to be got rid of. After  all,  thrombosis
is a condition of paralysis. Any paralysed part of the body cannot  function
properly, thus if a body is infected with thrombosis - public  servants  who
do not perform properly - it cannot function well.

Partiality is also corrupt behaviour on the part of  public  officers.  They
are expected to  act  even-handedly  and  treat  all  people  alike.  Public
officers should not be seen to be hobnobbing with  this  or  that  political
party. Their duty is to serve the government of  the  day.  The  Bill  warns
against public officers ... [Time expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, may I take this opportunity to compliment  hon
Meruti on her maiden speech. Well done. I  also  want  to  congratulate  hon
Swart on his position on the Magistrates Commission.

Sadly, corruption is evident in South Africa. We have taken note, with  much
dismay, of charges of corruption being levelled against  some  of  our  very
prominent people. Our disgust at corrupt behaviour is infinite,  considering
the poverty of our nation.

The MF is strongly anticorruption, and therefore supports the prevention  of
corruption wholeheartedly. It is hoped that introducing  laws  that  make  a
number of actions corrupt, will instil fear in criminals. It is  also  hoped
that awareness of corruption will increase, and  that  greater  emphasis  on
moral behaviour will lead to the prevention of corruption.

In our democracy  we  strive  to  assure  our  citizenry  that  we  are  the
Government of the people, and that we are trying our  utmost  to  govern  in
their best interest. Acts of  corruption  in  our  system  break  down  this
confidence, and no matter how hard the majority of us try  to  maintain  and
ensure our efficiency, corruption breaks down assurance  and  confidence  in
our system.

Corruption is a criminal  offence  and  deserves  punishment.  By  enforcing
punishing these criminals, we reassure those who lost  confidence  that  we,
as Government, will not tolerate any wrongdoing towards our citizenry.

The MF says: Stamp out corruption. We will not tolerate it in South  Africa.
We are a united people. Let's unite against corruption. The  provisions  are
well-structured in this Bill, and it is hoped that it  will  be  implemented
firmly. The MF supports the Prevention and Combating of  Corrupt  Activities
Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Chairperson, when the ANC came to  power  in  1994  and
brought to this country its first  democracy,  it  inherited  a  country  in
which corruption was rife. The pre-1994  state  mechanisms  to  prevent,  or
deal with, crime and corruption, were unstructured, ineffective,  incoherent
and therefore  completely  useless.  In  this  environment,  crime,  and  in
particular corruption thrived. Therefore, it is very surprising  and  rather
rich for somebody like Sheila Camerer,  who  was  so  intimately  associated
with that era, to stand here today and tell us how to deal with corruption.

What propped up that vile administration and state  if  not  "corruption  at
the highest levels", as she put it? The hon Camerer is being completely  and
blatantly dishonest when she suggests that we in the ANC  dragged  our  feet
in implementing anticorruption measures. What did the  apartheid  government
in which you ... Oh, I see she is not here.  So,  I  am  not  sure  why  she
laments the absence of Patricia de Lille when her own commitment is so  very
questionable. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: That's a bit unfair, you know.

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: The ANC Government has  done  more  in  ten  years,  Mr
Gibson, than has ever been done in the history  of  this  country  to  fight
corruption, and you know it, and she  knows  it  as  well.  [Interjections.]
Very early on, the ANC's approach ... [Interjections.] I am  going  to  show
why I am saying what I am saying.

Very early on,  the  ANC's  approach  was  to  improve  and  strengthen  our
legislative arsenal, as well as  our  crime-busting  institutions.  In  this
regard I am indebted to the Minister, who in  his  speech  has  referred  to
some of the measures we have taken in the last few years.

Mrs Camerer has spoken of their party's commitment  from  2001.  Let  me  go
well back to 1995 and 1997 when ... [Interjections.]  It  is  not  going  to
help to shout,  because  you  should  listen,  then  maybe  you  will  learn
something  about  what  it  is  that  we  are  doing  to  fight  corruption.
[Interjections.]

Various innovative amendments were effected to our bail laws  so  that  when
an accused is charged with corruption in excess of R500 000,  he  bears  the
onus of proving to the court that  the  interests  of  justice  dictate  his
release on bail.

Dis eintlik 'n baie streng boodskap, Mnr Groenewald ... [It  is  actually  a
very strong message, Mr Groenewald ...]

... who is also not  here.  Again,  in  1996,  this  Government  passed  the
Proceeds of Crime Act. This Act allows the  state  to  confiscate  money  or
property forming the proceeds of crime. This took profit away from crime.

There is another one: the Prevention of Organised Crime Act. The  Government
also established many crime-busting  institutions,  such  as  the  SIUs  and
special tribunals, which were refined by the Act  that  we  passed  in  this
House in 1995 called the Investigation of Serious Economic Offences Act.  We
passed the International  Co-operation  in  Criminal  Matters  Act  in  1996
already. Within the NDPP's  office,  there  exists  dedicated  directorates,
directed towards combating corruption specifically. These are just  some  of
the initiatives of this Government since 1994,  and  basically  to  suggests
that the ANC has been inconsistent in its  attempts  to  try  and  eradicate
this scourge, is completely and utterly untrue.

What our President is on record as saying, is that the  ANC  will  root  out
corruption and will display zero tolerance toward those who  seek  to  erode
our accomplishments as a people. But having said that, it must  be  kept  in
mind that the big difference between us and  the  DA  is  that  the  ANC  is
always mindful that in whatever we do, the rule of law must be upheld  first
and foremost.

It is not becoming of us, as a people, to display frenzied  glee  and  begin
frothing at the mouth at the mere allegation of corruption. As a people,  we
have committed ourselves to a higher,  more  profound  value  than  that.  I
thought we had become more civilised since  the  days  when  certain  people
were burnt at the stake without any recourse or scope for due process.

Innocent until proven guilty is a living commitment that all democrats  must
cherish. It is to the advantage of our country, our people  and  our  future
that we jealously guard its survival. I thank you. [Applause.]

The  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,
essentially I am rising to thank all  the  representatives  of  the  various
parties who have spoken in support of this very important  Bill.  Thank  you
indeed, hon members.

Quite a number of speakers, particularly from the ANC, have expressed  their
concern that the hon Sheila Camerer is not here. I want to  assure  the  hon
members that she has not gone  to  have  her  hair  done.  She  has  a  very
important public task to perform and  she  wrote  to  me  about  it.  If  it
pleases you, Chairperson and hon members,  I  am  going  to  read  the  love
letter I got from her, and it reads as follows:


  Dear Pennuel, I apologise for not staying for your reply, but my  son  is
  getting married on Saturday and I have a  houseful  of  guests.  Regards,
  Sheila.

It's a very important public task, indeed.

Firstly, I think we should state for the record that there  is  no  document
before any court in the  Republic  of  South  Africa  in  which  the  Deputy
President of the Republic of South Africa is implicated  in  the  commission
of crime. [Interjections.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: That's quite right.

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  We  should  state
that for the record. It would indeed be very sad if his name  was  mentioned
in a charge sheet or an indictment, but, the truth,  hon  members,  is  that
the Deputy President has  not  been  charged  with  the  commission  of  any
offence, and it behoves us, as leaders, to state these basic truths for  the
erudition of our own followers. It  doesn't  serve  any  useful  purpose  to
pretend that there is indeed a problem in that regard. You  won't  find  any
such document anywhere.

Secondly, it strikes me indeed that whilst the  hon  Sheila  Camerer  gives,
quite rightly so, a long catalogue of actions that have been  taken  by  the
ANC-led Government on the issue of corruption against  individuals  as  well
as certain  institutions,  including,  unhappily  so,  elements  of  my  own
department, what she doesn't say is who has taken this action against them.

But, before I come to that, I also want to say that we have  given  part  of
the catalogue of laws and,  indeed,  mechanisms  that  this  Government  has
established to deal with this problem. Now,  with  all  that  knowledge,  it
really surprises some of us that there are still  people  who  believe  that
there is a lack of will on the part  of  Government.  The  hon  member  even
quoted me out of turn to try and substantiate this palpable falsehood.

The truth is that I was not speaking about the lack of will on the  part  of
my Government because I knew what the Government was doing when I made  that
statement. I was talking about the need for all governments to act  robustly
against the issue of corruption. I wasn't saying mine  was  not  acting.  We
have a very long and impressive record of what we have done on the issue  of
corruption and related activities since 1994. Those who have eyes  will  see
it. Those who have ears will listen to this and at least, unless  they  have
evidence to the contrary, will accept the earnest resolve of  my  Government
to deal with this problem. We  are  dealing  with  it,  and  indeed  we  are
getting on top of it.

It doesn't serve any useful purpose  to  try  and  score  political  points,
especially when you are going to rely on falsehoods. We are  acting  against
it. For us there is no untouchable. We have not spared  anyone.  When  there
is probable cause to act against a person, no matter  where  he  or  she  is
located, we take appropriate action, and that is  correct.  Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

         CONSIDERATION OF RESTITUTION OF LAND RIGHTS AMENDMENT BILL

Mr D M DLALI: Chairperson, in introducing this amendment,  I  just  want  to
raise one or two issues. Firstly, we have been  advised  that  AgriSA,  with
Nafu and other stakeholders, are fully behind and  support  this  amendment,
in terms of clause 5, which also indicates, in terms of  section  3  of  the
Promotion of Administrative Justice Act, that we, therefore, support  it  on
the basis that it is going to deal with a  number  of  developmental  issues
and will also contribute to the betterment of  our  communities  in  various
areas. Thank you, Chairperson.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the Bill be agreed to.

Thank you.

Declarations of vote:
Mnr A  J  BOTHA:  Voorsitter,  hierdie  wetsontwerp  is  net  so  onderduims
gehanteer soos gister se verkiesing van die  Pan-Afrikaanse  parlementslede,
waartydens die ANC 'n apartheidsargitek aan Afrika opgedwing het,  in  plaas
van 'n Afrika-argitek soos Colin Eglin, wat 40 jaar van  sy  lewe  gewy  het
aan die herstel van die menseregte van al hierdie  ANC-lede  wat  hier  sit.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Waarskynlik moet dit niemand verbaas dat die nuwe  skenders  van  menseregte
die vorige  skenders  beloon  vir  hulle  kundige  dienstigheid  in  hierdie
verband nie. Die skending waarvan ons praat  is  die  drakoniese  magte  wat
hierdie wetsontwerp wil gee aan die Minister vir Landbou en Grondsake om  te
besluit wie is die regmatige eienaar van enige stuk grond, op enige plek  in
Suid-Afrika, en AgriSA steun nie daardie kwessie nie, wat  'n  mens  ook  al
daarvan mag dink.

Dit is 'n fundamentele aanval op die regstaat  en  geen  paneelkloppery  van
stertjies of angels kan dit verbeter, soos die besondere onkundige  Nuwe  NP
naprater van die ANC in die ander Huis  gereeld  probeer  voorgee  nie.  Vir
diesulkes en hulle imbongis se kennisname: moord kan nie verbeter word  deur
met stertjies en angeltjies te toor nie. As jy iemand se kop  afkap,  is  sy
kop af, of die byl nou stomp of skerp was.

Voordat  die  agb  President  die  DA  weer  soos  gewoonlik  beskuldig  van
rassisme, omdat ons kwansuis net bekommerd is oor wit regte, het ek vir  hom
'n stukkie opgedateerde  nuus.  Die  DA  sal  net  so  hard  spook  vir  die
menseregte van kommunale boere wanneer  die  ANC  probeer  om  die  Minister
soortgelyke diskresionêre magte te  gee  om  te  besluit  wie  is  regmatige
eienaars in kommunale gebied en wie is nie.

Dit is verblydend dat organisasies soos die SA Raad van Kerke en  die  Legal
Resource Centre, en andere, dieselfde mening huldig. Maar ons wil dit  onder
hulle aandag bring dat ook hulle nie dubbele standaarde moet  handhaaf  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Die onaanvaarbare diskressionêre magte  wat  die  Communal
Land Rights Bill aan die Minister wil gee, kon alreeds in die  kiem  gesmoor
gewees het tydens die openbare verhore van die  Wetsontwerp  op  Restitusie,
maar toe was hulle stil hieroor. Die les wat hieruit geleer  moet  word,  is
dat regte op beginsels berus en nie  op  dienstigheid  of  vooroordele  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A J BOTHA: Chairperson, this Bill has been dealt with  in  an  underhand
manner, as was the election of the members  of  the  Pan-African  Parliament
yesterday, during which the ANC forced an architect of apartheid on  Africa,
instead of an architect of Africa like Colin Eglin, who dedicated  40  years
of his life to the restitution of the human rights of all these ANC  members
who are sitting here. [Interjections.]

It should probably surprise nobody that the new violators  of  human  rights
are rewarding the previous violators for their skilful  expediency  in  this
regard. The violation we are referring to is the draconian powers that  this
Bill seeks to give the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs  to  decide
who is the rightful owner of any piece of land, anywhere  in  South  Africa,
and AgriSA does not support that, whatever one may think of it.

It is a fundamental attack on the legal state, and no panelbeating of  tails
and stings can improve it, as the extremely ignorant New NP yes-man  of  the
ANC in the  other  House  regularly  tries  to  suggest  it  does.  For  the
information of such people and their imbongis:  murder  cannot  be  improved
upon by juggling tails and stings. If you chop off someone's head, his  head
is off, whether the axe was sharp or blunt.

Before the hon President accuses the DA of racism as usual, because  we  are
ostensibly only concerned about the  rights  of  white  people,  I  have  an
updated newsflash for him. The DA will struggle just as hard for  the  human
rights of communal farmers when the ANC tries to give the  Minister  similar
discretionary powers to decide who  are  the  rightful  owners  in  communal
areas, and who are not.

It is heartening that organisations such as the SA Council of  Churches  and
the Legal Resource Centre, and others, are of the same opinion. But we  want
to bring it  to  their  attention  that  they  should  not  practise  double
standards either. [Interjections.]  The  unacceptable  discretionary  powers
that the Communal Land Rights Bill seeks to give the  Minister,  could  have
been nipped in the bud during the public hearings of the  restitution  Bill,
but they kept quiet about this then. The lesson to be learnt  from  this  is
that  the  rights  are  based  on  principles  and  not  on  expediency   or
prejudice.]

Great  structures  can  remain  standing  for  millennia,  or  they  can  be
destroyed suddenly by cataclysmic events, or they can be destroyed  by  slow
decay on account of neglect and pilfering. The  action  of  this  Parliament
today is most decidedly in the latter  category.  Those  colluding  in  this
pilfering of principle will be branded by  history,  just  as  certainly  as
those who colluded in the crime of apartheid are forever branded by it.

The DA rejects this Bill and we will in  future  reject  the  Communal  Land
Rights Bill for as long as it undermines the rule of law by diminishing  the
basic human rights of the communal landowners. [Applause.]

Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Agb  Voorsitter,  die  feit  dat  daar  restitusie  moet
plaasvind in Suid-Afrika word algemeen gesteun en aanvaar.  Dit  is  nie  in
dispuut nie. Wat wel in  dispuut  is,  is  die  wyse  waarvolgens  dit  moet
geskied.

Die wysigingswetsontwerp skep nuwe magte vir die  Minister  van  Landbou  en
Grondsake om grond weg te neem van een eienaar en dit aan  'n  nuwe  eienaar
te gee sonder dat dit deur  'n  hof  beoordeel,  en  deur  'n  regsuitspraak
gemagtig word. Die doel voorgehou vir hierdie magte aan die Minister is  dat
dit die verkryging van grond vir restitusie doeleindes  sal  versnel  om  so
die  hele  proses  te  bespoedig.  Die  FA  is  van  mening  dat  juis   die
teenoorgestelde sal gebeur, naamlik, dat die proses aansienlik vertraag  kan
word as gevolg van dispute wat agterna deur 'n  regsproses  uitgeklaar  moet
word, omdat dit nie aan die begin deur 'n hof uitgeklaar is nie.

Die probleem is nie die verkryging van grond  nie,  maar  om  die  legitieme
eienaarskap van individue en groepe eisers wat aanspraak maak  op  grond  te
bepaal,  en  om  die  gevolglike  oordra  van  eienaarskap   op   'n   vaste
regsuitspraak te vestig. Voorheen is die proses deur 'n  regter  in  'n  hof
uitgevoer, maar word nou, volgens die wysigingswet, aan die Minister en  die
Departement van Landbou en Grondsake oorgedra om oor te besluit  en  uit  te
voer.

Met alle respek teenoor  die  Minister,  maar  die  politieke  hoof  van  'n
departement is nie in regsake opgelei nie, en so  ook  nie  die  Departement
van Grondsake nie, om voldoende sekerheid te  gee  aan  so  'n  ingewikkelde
proses van onteiening deur hulle  besluite,  en  dit  sonder  'n  hofstempel
daarop. Die gevolg hiervan sal wees dat  indien  daar  'n  dispuut  oor  die
eienaarskap is, of indien die proses betwis word, sal die aangeleentheid  in
elk geval na 'n hof verwys word vir uitspraak. Sou dit gebeur,  en  dit  sal
gebeur, sal dit die proses nog verder vertraag.

Die beginsel in die wysigingswetsonwerp vervat, maak  van  die  Minister  en
die Departement van Landbou en Grondsake die ondersoeker,  die  beoordelaar,
die toekenner en  die  regter  om  restitusie  deur  te  voer.  Dit  is  nie
aanvaarbaar  nie.  Dit  is  onaanvaarbaar,  en  nie  goed  genoeg  vir   die
regsproses en demokrasie om soveel mag in  die  hande  van  een  persoon  of
Minister te plaas nie.

Die FA is teen die wysigingswetsontwerp gekant.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr A I VAN NIEKERK: Hon Chairperson, the fact that restitution has to  take
place in South Africa is generally supported and accepted. That  is  not  in
dispute. What is in dispute is the manner in which it should take place.

The amending Bill creates new powers for the Minister  for  Agriculture  and
Land Affairs to take land away  from  one  owner  and  give  it  to  another
without the matter being judged  by  a  court  and  authorised  by  a  legal
judgment. The reason for giving these powers to  the  Minister  is  that  it
will speed up the acquisition of land for the  purposes  of  restitution  in
order to expedite the  entire  process.  The  FA  is  of  the  opinion  that
precisely the opposite  will  happen,  namely  that  the  process  could  be
significantly delayed as a result of disputes having to be resolved  by  way
of a legal process afterwards because matters were not being cleared  up  by
a court to begin with.

The problem is not the acquisition of land, but determining  the  legitimate
ownership of individuals and groups of claimants laying claim to  land,  and
basing the consequent transfer  of  ownership  on  a  firm  legal  judgment.
Previously, this process was  carried  out  by  a  judge  in  a  court  but,
according to the amending Bill, it is now being transferred to the  Minister
and the Department of Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs  to  decide  upon  and
implement.

With all due respect to the Minister, the political head of a department  is
not trained in  legal  matters,  and  neither  is  the  Department  of  Land
Affairs, in order to provide such a  complicated  process  of  expropriation
with sufficient certainty through their  decisions,  and  that  without  the
approval of a court. The consequence of this will be  that  if  there  is  a
dispute about the ownership, or if the  process  is  contested,  the  matter
will be referred to a court for a judgment in any  case.  If  this  happens,
and it will happen, it will delay the process even further.

The principle contained in the amending Bill  makes  the  Minister  and  the
Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs the investigator,  the  assessor,
the  allocator  and  the  judge  to  carry  out  restitution.  That  is  not
acceptable. It is unacceptable, and not good enough for  the  legal  process
and democracy to place  so  much  power  in  the  hands  of  one  person  or
Minister.

The FA opposes the amending Bill.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Chairperson, the IFP is grateful to the DA for giving us  this
opportunity to inform the House that the amendment by  the  NCOP  was  first
introduced during the meeting by the  IFP  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Agriculture and Land Affairs. The IFP introduced this  very  amendment,  but
it was rejected. It took the NCOP to drive the sense home. The IFP  supports
this amendment, even now. [Applause.]

Mnr S ABRAM:  Agb  Voorsitter,  ons  in  die  ANC  steun  natuurlik  hierdie
wysiging wat deur die NRVP aanvaar is.

Ek wil net graag aan die agb Raad sê dat die agb lid Botha  van  die  DA  al
voorheen beweer het dat die Parlement met  hierdie  wetgewing  omseil  word.
Hier kry dieselfde agb lid, op sy eie aandrang, weer 'n  geleentheid  om  in
die Parlement daaroor te praat. Kan dit wees dat agb Botha  nie  Suid-Afrika
se Grondwet ken nie? Die een wat hy plegtig,  met  'n  handtekening  daarby,
onderneem het om te bevorder en te beskerm? Of is hy  juis  doelbewus  besig
om met hierdie uitsprake teen die Grondwet atmosfeer te skep?

Die beginsels vir die onteiening van grond in die openbare  belang  is  juis
in hierdie Grondwet se artikel 25 vasgepen. Of steun die agb Botha  nou  nie
meer die Grondwet as die land se  hoogste  wet  nie?  Die  DA  se  gemaklike
samewerking met regse elemente, soos  die  verkrampte  Transvaalse  Landbou-
unie en selfs die ou wit vakbond, die Blanke  Mynwerkers-unie,  wat  nou  sy
naam  na  Solidariteit  verander  het,  is  ook  blootgestel  toe  die  TLU-
afvaardiging  sy  voorleggings  kom  doen  het,  en  net  die  DA   se   wit
parlementslede met sy vertrek, voor ons almal se oë, gegroet het.

Mnr  Andries  Botha,  die  DA  woordvoerder,  het  onder  andere  gesê   die
veranderinge is kosmeties. Sy regse bedmaatjies,  die  Transvaalse  Landbou-
unie, het hom gesteun, en verskil skerp van die Regering  se  plan  met  dié
wetsontwerp.  Mnr  Willie  Lewies,   die   voorsitter   van   die   TLU   se
eiendomsregkomitee, het aan  koerante  bevestig  dat  die  TLU  in  beginsel
steeds alle grondeise gaan teenstaan, en glo dat alle grond, ook  dorpserwe,
nou onteien kan word.

Op 'n webwerf noem die TLU alle onteiening "grondroof" en u  heul  saam  met
hulle. Hoe roof 'n mens iemand se grond  as  jy  hom  daarvoor  billik  gaan
vergoed, want in hierdie wysiging  word  verwys  na  die  bepalings  van  'n
administratiewe regsproses, 'n wet? [Tussenwerpsels.] Tog  lyk  dit  of  die
TLU en die DA in so 'n siening verenig is. Onteiening kan tog  hoogstens  as
'n gedwonge verkoopstransaksie beskou word, en nie die teësinnige afvat  van
grond  soos  wat  in  Die  Beeld  en   Die   Burger   al   berig   is   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Mnr Botha, die DA se woordvoerder oor landbou, sê dit  is  onsinnig  om  die
Minister die reg te gee om te besluit oor  die  gematigdheid  van  eise.  In
Pretoria is daar huise wat al etlike dekades staan, en wat nou  onteien  kan
word, so beweer Mnr Botha. Mnr Botha reken die blote  moontlikheid  dat  dit
kan gebeur, is nadelig vir beleggersvertroue en vir reg en orde.

Laastens moet daar iets gesê word oor die DA se segsman oor  grondsake,  die
agb Dan Maluleke. Ons het hom leer ken as iemand wat  insig  het  en  begrip
toon vir die penarie van derduisende burgers teen wie al gediskrimineer  is.
Maar dit lyk asof sy landbou-ampsgenoot, die agb Botha, nie  na  goeie  raad
van hom kan luister nie. Miskien sal die agb  Maluleke  tuiser  wees  in  'n
party wat nie deur 'n blanke oormag oorheers word nie,  soos  die  DA.  [Tyd
verstreke.] [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr S  ABRAM:  Hon  Chairperson,  we  in  the  ANC  obviously  support  this
amendment as adopted by the NCOP.

I would just like to tell the hon House that the hon member Botha of the  DA
has  alleged  before  that  Parliament  is  being  circumvented  with   this
legislation. Here the  same  member,  at  his  own  insistence,  is  getting
another opportunity to discuss it in Parliament. Could it be  that  the  hon
Botha is not acquainted with the South African Constitution?  The  one  that
he, with an accompanying signature, solemnly swore to promote  and  protect?
Or is he deliberately trying to create  a  negative  atmosphere  around  the
Constitution with these remarks?

The principles pertaining  to  the  expropriation  of  land  in  the  public
interest are in fact entrenched in section 25 of this Constitution. Or  does
the hon Botha no longer support the Constitution as the highest law  of  the
land? The DA's convenient co-operation with rightwing elements, such as  the
ultra-conservative Tranvaal Agricultural Union and even the old white  trade
union, the White Mineworkers Union,  which  has  now  changed  its  name  to
Solidarity, was also exposed when  the  TAU  delegation  came  to  make  its
submissions, and only greeted the  DA's  white  parliamentary  members  when
they departed, in full view of us all.

Mr Andries Botha, the DA spokesperson said, inter  alia,  that  the  changes
are cosmetic. His rightwing bedfellows, the  Transvaal  Agricultural  Union,
supported him and disagree sharply with  the  Government's  plan  with  this
Bill. Mr Willie Lewies, the chairperson of the TAU's land tenure  committee,
has confirmed to newspapers that the  TAU  will  in  principle  continue  to
oppose all land claims, and believes that all land, even  urban  plots,  can
now be expropriated.

On a website the TAU calls  all  expropriation  land  robbery  and  you  are
collaborating with them. How do you rob a person of his  land,  if  you  are
going to offer him fair compensation, because in  this  amendment  reference
is made to the provisions  of  an  administrative  legal  process,  an  Act?
[Interjections.] Yet it would seem that the TAU and the  DA  are  united  in
this view. Expropriation can,  at  best,  be  regarded  as  a  forced  sales
transaction, and not the grudging taking away of land as  has  already  been
reported in Die Beeld and Die Burger. [Interjections.]

Mr Botha, the DA's spokesperson on agriculture, says it is  absurd  to  give
the Minister the right to decide on the legality  of  claims.  Mr  Botha  is
alleging that houses in Pretoria,  which  have  been  standing  for  several
decades, can now be expropriated. Mr Botha is of the opinion that  the  mere
possibility that this could happen is bad for investor  confidence  and  law
and order.

In conclusion, let me say something about  the  DA's  spokesperson  on  land
affairs, the hon Dan Maluleke. We have got to know him as  someone  who  has
shown insight and  understanding  for  the  predicament  of  thousands  upon
thousands of citizens who have suffered discrimination. But it seems  as  if
his agriculture colleague, the hon Botha, is unable to listen  to  his  good
advice. Perhaps the hon Maluleke would be more at home in a  party  that  is
not  dominated  by  a  white  majority,  like  the   DA.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Millin, I had recognised  your  hand  but
when I looked in your direction you were busy caucusing with the NA.  So,  I
had to give the opportunity to the ANC. I'm sorry about that.

Motion  agreed  to  (Democratic  Alliance,  Independent  African   Movement,
Freedom Front, Federal Alliance and National Action dissenting).

Bill accordingly agreed to.

               CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC COMMITTEE ON
                          PUBLIC AUDITING FUNCTION
Mr V G SMITH: Chairperson, the Ad Hoc Committee on Public Auditing  Function
was established by resolution of the House and mandated to introduce a  Bill
on the objects contained in the legislative proposal reviewing the  auditing
function, which was submitted to the Speaker by the Audit Commission.

The committee received and  considered  submissions  from  stakeholders  and
thereafter conducted public hearings. The committee also  consulted  widely,
amongst others, with the Chairperson of  the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on
Intelligence, the Chairperson of the Portfolio  Committee  on  Defence,  the
Auditor-General, the Speaker of the National Assembly, the  Presidency,  the
national Department of Defence, the SAPS,  the  National  Treasury  and  the
national Department of Intelligence.

The Public Audit Bill that we are introducing in the House gives  effect  to
section 55(2), section 181(3) and section 188 of our Constitution. The  Bill
is further proof of this Government's resolve  to  deepen  and  protect  our
democracy.

The Bill also seeks to improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the
Office of the Auditor-General. In introducing this Bill, we  recommend  that
members of this House be accorded an opportunity to debate the  Bill.  Thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

                            RULE OF ANTICIPATION

                                  (Ruling)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, before we proceed, I have to give a ruling. On  18
November, the hon Mrs Van Wyk made a statement on the proposed  appointments
to the SABC Board,  a  matter  that  had  been  specifically  scheduled  for
consideration by the House on the following day,  19  November.  The  Deputy
Chief Whip of the Majority Party subsequently, on a point  of  order,  asked
whether the hon Mrs Van Wyk's statement was not in breach  of  the  Rule  of
Anticipation. Member's statements, as an element of the proceedings  of  the
House are necessarily subject to the Rules of Debate.

The Rule of  Anticipation,  that's  Rule  68,  states  that  no  member  may
anticipate the discussion on a matter  appearing  on  the  Order  Paper.  It
provides further that the Chair, in determining whether a discussion is  out
of  order  on  the  grounds  of  anticipation,  shall  have  regard  to  the
probability that the matter anticipated will come before the House within  a
reasonable time.

I've always held the view that  there  should  be  as  few  restrictions  as
possible on members' right to freedom of speech and in  applying  the  Rules
I've always tried to exercise  my  discretion  accordingly.  Members  should
note, however, that the Rule of Anticipation, in essence, does  not  prevent
members from airing their views but requires them to make their input at  an
appropriate time.

In this specific case of the hon Mrs Van Wyk's statement,  she  was  clearly
anticipating the discussion scheduled for the following day,  and  was  pre-
empting that discussion for which debating  time  had  been  allocated.  I'm
therefore in agreement with the hon Deputy Chief Whip of the Majority  Party
that the hon Mrs Van Wyk's statement was in breach of the Rules.

It will serve no purpose for me to request  her  to  retract  the  statement
after the event. I would, however, appeal to members, generally, to  observe
the Rule of Anticipation when making statements and  to  raise  a  point  of
order when they think a member is transgressing the Rule.

Members' statements are  a  new  feature  of  our  proceedings  and  in  the
establishing  of  good  practice,  the  Chair  will  apply   the   Rule   of
Anticipation to members' statements in circumstances where there is a  clear
opportunity in the near future for a member to make his or her input on  the
particular subject.

I am giving this ruling as a guide to members.  It's  not  to  ask  for  any
withdrawal, as I have said, and I would appreciate  it  if  in  future  this
matter will be dealt with and members will take heed and  Whips  will  guide
their members. I know there is a long recess coming, so when you  come  back
maybe you can guide your members and make sure that we do not transgress  on
the Rule.

I'm  sure,  Mr  Gibson,  you  are  going  to  be  practising  your  whipping
techniques  during  the   recess.   [Interjections.]   Perhaps   that's   an
appropriate time, hon members, to come to farewell speeches.

                              FAREWELL SPEECHES

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam  Speaker,  I  rise  to  express  my  good  wishes  to
colleagues in all parts of the House, including the interjector there.  This
has been a busy year and the election, which I understand  is  taking  place
on 31 March 2004, means that holidays and relaxation  will  be  short.  Even
some of our less energetic colleagues will join the rest of us who are  keen
constituency MPs and reach out to those  whom  we  represent  or  aspire  to
represent.

This  year  has  been  packed  with  activity,   sensation   and   political
controversy, all of which are the lifeblood of politics and  of  Parliament.
I must say that in most respects Government and opposition  Whips  have  co-
operated well, and  I  thank  our  colleagues  in  the  Whippery  for  their
courtesy and consideration.

My friend, the hon ANC Chief Whip, rules with a light hand  and  his  deputy
is most hardworking and attentive, and we appreciate  the  efforts  he  puts
in. We have no difficulties on a personal basis with any of  the  ANC  Whips
and regard many of them as friends. The same may be said  of  the  Whips  of
all other parties.

What a pity it is that the ANC political leadership made the year end  on  a
very sour note. Instead of the launch of the Pan-African Parliament being  a
glad occasion for all South Africans, we saw a sham election which  rewarded
an MP for providing the sort of opposition which the ANC prefers.

I hope that after the elections, if the ANC is returned to  power,  it  will
resist abusing that power any further, because democracy is still a  fragile
plant in our country. Sometimes the wise move - and the wise thing to  do  -
is to refrain from exercising the power which you have.

I am glad that I missed yesterday's meeting of the  joint  rules  committee.
According to all reports, it was a meeting which achieved  too  little.  Ten
years into democracy we really should have been further along the  road  for
having a proper professional meeting which achieves concrete results.

Documents are  often  late  or  inadequate.  Decisions  are  delayed,  often
because the  parties  themselves  delay  matters  by  failing  to  do  their
homework. Sometimes decisions are not  carried  out  or  are  insufficiently
clear.
I want to suggest that we should consider having action minutes  instead  of
narrative minutes. It is all wonderful to read five years later what  Gibson
said, or what this one or that one said. What  is  much  more  important  is
what was decided and who was supposed to do something by what date, so  that
when one gets to the next meeting and if action has not been taken, you  can
say the New NP is the only party which has failed to  do  its  homework  and
they therefore delayed the decision - and put the blame  where  it  belongs,
instead of just saying, ``the parties have failed to  do  what  they  should
have done''. I really think that in  that  way  we  will  inject  some  more
professionalism into this whole thing.

I want to say that at the end of a year we have the  opportunity  of  saying
farewell to each other. We also  have  the  opportunity,  I  understand,  of
saying farewell to the former leader of  the  PAC.  I  understand  that  hon
Stanley Mogoba is soon going to be leaving us, and I want to wish him  well.
He is a decent and nice man and I don't think the PAC deserved him.
We have an opportunity of thanking the presiding officers and  we  are  very
grateful for what you do for us, also generally  ruling  with  a  relatively
light hand. We thank the parliamentary officials who serve  us  and  through
us, the people of South Africa. Most  of  them,  not  all  of  them,  do  so
willingly and cheerfully. I want to thank them at  all  levels,  right  from
the top to the bottom.

It remains for me to wish all of you in this Chamber a happy and  a  healthy
holiday and some good quality time with friends, with family  and  with  all
those who love you. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker and hon members, we have come to  the  end  of
yet another year and almost the end of another term  of  office.  This  past
year has been a difficult  year  for  most  people  and  this  last  term  a
particularly difficult period with many emotions running high.

There is still much unfinished business in this Parliament  at  this  stage.
There is still a sad lack of understanding by those who decide on  financial
priorities of Parliament, who still cannot grasp the plight of members  with
regard to adequate resources to be able to carry out their  responsibilities
as members of Parliament both here and in their constituencies.

But there have also been achievements, and let  us  rather  for  the  moment
dwell on them. Time does not permit me to say too much,  except  to  express
my appreciation to the many  who  deserve  our  thanks.  There  is  a  great
tendency in this world for individuals to take full  credit  for  what  they
have achieved in life, for the successes in particular,  and  to  put  blame
elsewhere when things go wrong.

In truth, there are few if any persons  who  can  claim  total  acclaim  for
anything good that has happened, for there is always  bound  to  be  someone
who has assisted along the way to make it happen - the secretary that  typed
the vital letter, the service officer who saw to  it  that  the  letter  was
delivered, the legal adviser who assisted in determining the  legalities  of
the matter, the colleagues from other parties  who  supported  a   proposal,
even our adversaries who, if nothing else, gave us  food  for  thought.  The
point is that we often take for granted the contribution others make in  our
lives and in our successes. We forget that they too have  been  part  of  it
and have succeeded as well.

Today, as we bid each other farewell for the year, I  would  like  to  thank
the many people who have  contributed  to  my  life  and  to  the  lives  of
parliamentarians over  this  past  year:  the  presiding  officers  -  Madam
Speaker, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Chairman of  Committees,  who  is  to  be
congratulated  on  making  major  changes  over  the  past  year  and   many
improvements that have been introduced to assist this Parliament; the  Chief
Whip and the Deputy Chief Whip of the ANC for their  co-operation  over  the
past year; programming Whips; Whips of other parties; and members  of  staff
of the Chief Whips' Forum. Our opinion is that the Chief  Whips'  Forum  has
done great things over this past year and together we have achieved a  great
deal.

I thank the Secretary to  Parliament  and  the  Secretary  to  the  National
Assembly and their staff members. Perhaps I should even mention  Mr  Mansura
and Ms Griebenouw because they are people that have done a  great  deal  for
us. The parliamentary legal advisers and many  people,  such  as  the  Chief
Financial  Officer,  that  have  done  a  lot  to  change  things  in   this
Parliament, and I thank  everybody  else.  When  I  say  everybody,  I  mean
catering staff, service officers, everybody.

Thank you all for your contributions over the past  year,  a  difficult  and
complex year, a controversial year, as we have  already  heard.  The  floor-
crossing gave many people much more than a few headaches, I  am  sure.  But,
people continued to contribute with a smile.  Each  and  every  contribution
has helped whatever successes have been achieved, and we thank you all.

As we reach election mode, let us all put into practice  the  words  of  the
great poet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, when he wrote:


  One virtue stands out above all others
  The constant striving upwards, wrestling with oneself,


  The constant desire for purity, wisdom, goodness and love.

May we all live as such, striving upwards, wrestling with ourselves,  having
the constant desire for purity, wisdom, goodness and love.

May I, on behalf of the IFP, wish you all a safe journey, wish you and  your
families a joyous and blessed Christmas, and may the peace and  joy  of  God
be with you throughout  the  recess  and  Christmas  period.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Speaker,  at  the  end  of  the  second  democratic
Parliament's fifth session, it is my pleasure to say a few words  of  thanks
on behalf of the New NP and to convey our season's greetings.

Die afgelope jaar was 'n besonder betekenisvolle jaar, waarin die  Parlement
steeds verder sy eie karakter ontwikkel het; 'n jaar waarin daar  weer  eens
oomblikke van plegtigheid en oomblikke van erns was, maar ook tye van  skerp
debat en gelukkig ook van gesonde humor wat aan die orde van  die  dag  was.
[The past year was an exceptionally significant  year  in  which  Parliament
developed its own character even further; a year in which  there  were  once
again solemn moments, serious moments, but also  times  where  sharp  debate
and luckily even healthy humour were the order of the day.]

The fact that the parliamentary process, as a whole, ran like  a  well-oiled
machine is, however, not only because of the members  but  also  because  of
the hard work of a diverse group of people.  Therefore,  we  want  to  thank
them and express our appreciation.

Namens my party, wil ek graag aan alle lede  dank  betuig  met  wie  ons  in
debat kon tree - soms vriendelik en soms krities - en waar die debatte  soms
hewig was, het ons dit egter almal met een doel voor oë  gedoen  en  dit  is
omdat elkeen van ons wil hê dat ons van Suid-Afrika 'n suksesvolle land  wil
maak. Waar ons met die hoofsweep van  die  amptelike  opposisie  soms  hewig
verskil, maar dit is 'n gewoonte wat mens nie kan afleer  nie.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[On behalf of my party, I wish to extend thanks to all members with whom  we
could enter into debate - sometimes friendly and sometimes  critical  -  and
where the debates were sometimes heated, we all did  it  with  one  goal  in
mind and that was because each one of  us  wants  to  make  South  Africa  a
successful country. We sometimes differ markedly with the Chief Whip of  the
Official Opposition, but that is a habit which cannot be broken.]

It is my pleasure to thank  the  Speaker,  Deputy  Speaker,  Chairperson  of
Committees and Deputy Chairperson of Committees for the manner in which  you
managed the Chair, sometimes under very difficult circumstances,  especially
during the past year with the number of parties increasing from  13  to  17,
which complicated matters even more.

Our thanks go to the Chief Whip and the Deputy Chief Whip  of  the  Majority
Party for the co-operation we enjoyed in specific forums. I would also  like
to thank the Whips of all  the  other  parties  for  the  collegiality  that
exists between us.

To the Secretary to Parliament, the  Secretary  of  the  National  Assembly,
Table and service personnel, caterers, security personnel,  including  those
who seem to have a tendency to bang the boots and bonnets  of  our  cars  in
the morning, our thanks and appreciation.

Aan die media wat 'n belangrike rol speel om die Parlement se werk  aan  die
gemeenskap daar buite bekend  te  stel,  wil  ons  ook  graag  ons  dank  en
waardering betuig. Ten slotte is dit vir my aangenaam om aan u een en  almal
'n vreugdevolle, rustige en veilige feestydperk toe te wens. Mag 2004 vir  u
almal voorspoed, vrede en geluk inhou. Ek dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[To the media who play a vital role in introducing Parliament's work to  the
community at large,  we  would  also  like  to  express  our  gratitude  and
appreciation. In conclusion, it is a pleasure to wish one and all a  joyous,
peaceful and safe festival season. May  2004  bring  prosperity,  peace  and
happiness to all of you. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, I am sure that all of us, and especially  those
MPs who have had a very large workload, are gratefully relieved  today  that
we have  come  to  the  end  of  a  very  busy  session.  This  session  was
exceptionally challenging to many of us, if you consider the many  hours  we
spent preparing our speeches,  attending  portfolio  committee  meetings  to
discuss legislation and the many other tasks thrust upon us as MPs.

The time has come  for  us  to  take  a  much-needed  break  from  our  busy
schedules. Our parliamentary debates have often been  very  robust,  but  we
thank  God  that  the  situation  never  reached  the  level  of  robustness
experienced in the Taiwanese parliament. Yes, we have had  moments  in  this
House when a strident MP would hit  below  the  belt,  especially  when  the
referee or the Speaker is not looking. But, usually such an  MP  is  brought
to order and reminded to fight according to the rules.  Despite  our  robust
and strident behaviour as MPs, we leave this  House  with  the  knowledge  -
like good sportsmen and  women  -  that  we  bear  no  grudges  against  the
governing party or any other opposition party.

We  are  mindful  that  all  of  us  are  in  Parliament  to  represent  our
constituencies; to speak for those who have elected us. By April next  year,
we will know how well we have articulated the views of our  supporters.  Let
us not encourage the loose talk from the public, when they say MPs are  lazy
and are riding on a gravy train. Only the uninformed will hold such a  view.
Now is the time to give more quality time to our family  members  and  loved
ones. Now is the time to do those many improvements at home  which  we  have
been pushing to the back of our minds.

In conclusion, let me wish you a well-deserved rest. My  sincere  thanks  to
the presiding officers, Madam Speaker and Deputy  Speaker,  the  Chairperson
and Deputy Chairperson of Committees. You have managed Parliament very  well
despite the robustness of this House. I wish to thank all the  Chief  Whips,
the Whips, the parliamentary staff, the Table  staff  and  all  the  service
sectors. We really appreciate your hard work. May you all rest  well  during
the Christmas holidays and come back next year refreshed, and we  trust  God
will keep you and your family members safe throughout the recess.

The ACDP wishes Bishop Mogoba of the PAC well in  his  retirement.  May  the
peace of God remain with us until we meet again. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P J GROENEWALD: Madam Speaker, we are yet again at  the  end  of  another
parliamentary year, and then I think of the words of Winston Churchill  when
he said that the only difference between war and politics  is  that  in  war
you are killed only once, but in politics many times. So  hon  members  will
know how many times they were killed during  this  parliamentary  year.  And
the FF Plus wants to say good luck for  what  lies  ahead.  I  can  actually
congratulate you on having survived this political year.

Maar, agb Speaker, ek wil ook namens ons hoofsweep ons  dank  en  waardering
uitspreek jeens die amptenare vir  hul  deel  wat  hulle  gelewer  het,  hul
bydraes. Uit die aard van die saak is niks volmaak nie, maar  dit  is  altyd
lekker om teen die einde van die jaar te kom dankie sê vir  dít  wat  gedoen
is. Ons wil ook graag namens die Vryheidsfront vir die lede  van  die  Suid-
Afrikaanse Polisiediens, wat eintlik sorg  dat  ons  kan  veilig  wees  hier
binnekant - ek weet nie, as ons partymaal kyk na sommige lede  se  reaksies,
weet ons nie of hulle 'n groter gevaar vir hulself óf vir mekaar  is  nie  -
dankie sê vir hul dienste wat gelewer is.

Ook wat die media betref, moet ons vir mekaar as parlementariërs sê  dat  as
die media nie ons boodskap uitdra nie, ons boodskap nie by  ons  mense  gaan
uitkom nie, en daarom van ons kant af ook baie dankie  vir  die  bydrae  van
die media. Ek aanvaar sommige toesprake mag vir hulle  baie  vervelig  wees,
sommige kan baie amusant wees, maar minstens dra hulle ook die boodskap  uit
na buite. Ons dank en waardering daarvoor.

Van die Vryheidsfront wil ons elke agb  lid  'n  geseënde  Kersfees  toewens
vorentoe. Mag u 'n ware Christusfees beleef, en mag u  volgende  jaar  almal
veilig terugkom, én mag ons almal 'n voorspoedige Nuwejaar hê. Baie  dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[But, hon Speaker, on behalf of our Chief Whip I want to express our  thanks
and  appreciation  to  the  officials  for  doing  their  share,  for  their
contributions. Naturally nothing is perfect, but at the end of the  year  it
is always a pleasure to come and say thank you for what has  been  done.  On
behalf of the Freedom Front we would like to say thank you  to  the  members
of the South African Police Service, who in fact ensure that we are safe  in
here - I don't know, sometimes when we look at some members'  reactions,  we
do not know if they are a greater danger to themselves or to one  another  -
for the services they have rendered.

With regard to the media, we must also tell one another as  parliamentarians
that if the media do not convey our message, our message will not reach  the
people,  and  therefore  we  want  to  say  thank  you  very  much  for  the
contribution of the media. I accept that they might find some speeches  very
boring, some can be very amusing, but at least they also carry  the  message
to the outside. Our thanks and appreciation for that.

On behalf of the Freedom Front we want to wish every hon  member  a  blessed
Christmas. May you experience a true  feast  of  Christ,  and  may  you  all
return safely next year, and may all of  us  have  a  prosperous  New  Year.
Thank you very much.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Madam Speaker and colleagues, today marks the last  day  of
the parliamentary year. We shall be going home to be with our  families  for
a while. To most of us  here  it  will  be  that  time  of  remembering  the
activity of Christ, and we wish all Christians the best  of  time,  as  they
celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace.

This year saw a proliferation of parties in the House, but we  are  grateful
that the exercise did not have any adverse  effects  on  the  procedures  of
this Assembly. We thank the staff for the way in which  they  were  able  to
adapt to the plethora of parties.

Great thanks go to the service officers who wear  smiles  all  the  time  as
they move about in the Chamber to render services. [Applause.] We could  not
have made the grade were it not for the dedication of the committee  clerks.
We owe it to them. We have had an unfortunate year in that this  institution
has been placed under the microscope on the issue of travel facilities.  Our
prayer is for members to be honourable  and  accept  the  responsibility  of
being leaders with responsibility.

Great thanks  go  to  the  Chief  Whip  of  the  Majority  Party  and  other
colleagues in the Whippery for  keeping  together  Parliament's  programmes.
The presiding officers, the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker, the Chairperson  of
Committees and the Deputy Chairperson of  Committees  deserve  the  greatest
applause for holding the debates in focus. God be with  you,  till  we  meet
again. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Speaker, when I came to this august  House,  six  years
ago, I felt like a  stranger  after  my  career  in  education,  church  and
prison, spanning nearly half a century, 43 years to be  exact.  What  struck
me most when I first came here was the lack of warmth in  this  House,  even
total hostility from the vast majority of people in this House and the  fear
that prevailed even among people I knew and had worked with before.

The short speaking time given to the minority parties was my next  shock.  I
had to get used to that. With time, I learnt how to make one or  two  points
in a speech, and cut out all the words, even  waffle.  My  famous  chop-chop
statement pulled me out of media obscurity into prominence  of  persecution,
even  almost  crucifixion.  [Laughter.]  That  statement  gave  me   useless
publicity which was so hostile that I could not even respond to  distortions
and misinterpretations. [Laughter.]

I do, however, wish to put the record straight. I'm not a violent person.  I
do not advocate violence. My entire career and belief is  a  statement  that
can be made. I was not even in favour of capital punishment, but the  horror
of the suffering of law-abiding, innocent and defenceless citizens moved  me
from my original position. Thus, unfortunately, I now  proclaim  a  Galilean
recantation, and yet it turns. So, somehow, one  gets  used  to  everything,
even praying.

I shall miss this Parliament and all the friends I made  here.  And  I  just
want to thank Madam Speaker, the  Deputy  Speaker,  the  officials  of  this
House and all the offices of Parliament for the manner  in  which  they  run
possibly one of the most important parliaments in the  world.  I  return  to
the pulpit to serve my home church, in Sekhukhuneland circuit,  and  I  hope
that from that situation, I will  have  the  opportunity  to  pray  for  the
President and for Parliament all the time.

Let me wish you a happy Christmas. Let me wish you accident-free  vacations,
and I hope God preserves you and  preserves  this  Parliament.  Amen.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Speaker, die FA  kyk  dankbaar  terug  oor  die  politieke
verwikkelinge van die afgelope  jaar.  Dit  was  ons  doelwit  om  opposisie
partye tot die besef te bring dat, ter wille van die land en  al  sy  mense,
hulle  'n  alliansie  moet  vorm  en  veelpartydemokrasie   moet   bevorder.
[Speaker, the FA is looking back gratefully to  the  political  developments
of the past year. It was our objective to bring  political  parties  to  the
realisation that, for the sake of the  country  and  all  its  people,  they
should form an alliance and promote multiparty democracy.]

At the end of another year it is clear that many politicians  still  do  not
know what multiparty democracy means. Many thought to themselves  they  must
become a "raasbalie" [windbag] - a one-person  party.  Others  thought  they
must add "plus" at the end of the name  of  their  party  to  become  multi.
[Laughter.]

There was one party whose member thought he must leave his party  -  and  it
was a one-man party - and he left it like he leaves a congregation, and  now
he holds the record for starting one-man parties. Strangest of all, a  dying
party claims that  by  joining  the  ruling  party  they  are  strengthening
democracy.

The FA, nevertheless, wishes all of you the best  over  the  festive  season
and holiday period, and hopes that you will experience peace  and  goodwill,
which Christmas brings to the world.

We look forward to seeing you back here in your benches  early  in  the  new
year, because at the end of the year some of you will no longer  be  members
of this Parliament, and then you will  hear  many  DA  speeches.  But  don't
despair; enjoy the holiday and come back refreshed so that you  can  perform
at your best during your notice month. [Laughter.]

Best wishes to you, Speaker, and your staff, and to all the members in  this
Chamber. And to everybody  who  will  vote  DA  next  year,  I  say,  "Drive
carefully," and to those who won't vote for the DA, who am  I  to  tell  you
how to drive anyway. You never did what the FA told you in any  case.  Thank
you, Madam Speaker. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker. Another year  draws  to  a  close
and I'm proud - we all have in our  diverse  political  views  ensured  that
democracy stands tall as a beacon of strength of the South  African  people.
We are sworn to perform our duties and have done so joyously.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all  those  who  have  worked
long hours to make our duties lighter. May God bless you for your hard  work
and dedication to the South African way. To the hon members, it has  been  a
challenging year and work well done. I hope  that  the  constituency  period
will enable us to return  next  year  with  greater  challenges  and  better
delivery for our people.

To our hon Speaker, Deputy Speaker, hon Ministers, Chief Whip, Deputy  Chief
Whip, all the Whips, presiding  officers,  chairpersons  of  committees  and
committee clerks, I sincerely thank you for all the  time  spent  in  making
our system more efficient and effective. To our support staff and  those  in
our offices, I thank you for all your  assistance  that  has  made  delivery
possible. To all those who have played a part in this governmental  process,
I thank you for your contributions. May God bless you.

Spend the holiday safely  and  return  safely  to  a  fresh  year  with  new
challenges. The MF joins in the celebration of our 10  years  of  democracy,
and as the MF we also  celebrate  10  years  of  existence  in  2004.  Merry
Christmas and a happy New Year filled with love, festivity and joy  to  all.
May I just say: Please don't drink and drive; if you drink, don't drive,  if
you drive, don't drink. God bless all of you. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker,  I  believe  this  is  my  last  end-of-the-year
farewell speech in this House, because after the elections the  NA  will  be
big enough to have its own Whip to perform this function. [Laughter.]

On behalf of the NA, I  want  to  thank  everyone  for  their  contributions
during the past year: to you, Madam Speaker, your Deputy and co-chairs,  the
personnel, the Whips, our secretaries, and the media.  It  was  a  difficult
year of adapting after the floor-crossings, and at the end  of  the  day  we
all came through it alive.

In view of the failure of our Springbok team  at  the  Rugby  World  Cup,  I
thought it fit today to choose a team from the ranks  of  Parliament,  which
would definitely have done better. And it is my privilege to  announce  that
team today. Unfortunately, some of the members are not present.

As fullback we choose the hon Tony Leon because  of  his  ability  to  fight
back from behind. [Laughter.] And, then, after his marriage to the  CP,  the
hon Petrus Mulder will, of course, occupy  the  right  wing,  with  the  hon
Jeremy Cronin on the left. [Laughter.]

The inside centre position will be taken by the hon Mosiuoa Lekota.  He  has
proved this year that he can take a lot of tackles.  [Laughter.]  The  other
centre will be the Rev Kenneth Meshoe; we must  have  someone  on  the  team
with higher contacts as well. [Laughter.]

As fly half, of course the  hon  Minister  of  Health.  She  tends  to  drop
everything that comes her way. [Laughter.] As scrum half,  the  Minister  of
Justice - he knows how to kick for touch when in trouble. [Laughter.]

Our tight-head prop is, of course, the Minister of Sport. By the  way,  he's
the only  quota  player  in  the  team;  the  rest  were  chosen  on  merit.
[Laughter.] As for  our  loose-head  prop,  well,  Patricia  "het  haar  kop
verloor" [lost her  head],  but  the  hon  Willem  Odendaal  gets  the  nod.
[Laughter.] Our  hooker  is  the  hon  Dennis  Bloem.  Ons  moet  darem  een
moeilikheidmaker in die span hê. [We should have at least  one  troublemaker
in the team.] [Laughter.]

Die een slot is Dr Boy Geldenhuys, want as die ANC sê spring dan spring  hy.
[The one lock is Dr Boy Geldenhuys, because when the ANC says jump, he  asks
how high.] [Laughter.] The other one must be the hon Gerhard  Koornhof,  but
he has a tendency to cross over to the opposition side halfway  through  the
match. [Laughter.]

The one flank will be the hon Deputy President. He has proved over and  over
again that he will never get a yellow card.  [Laughter.]  The  number  eight
will be the  hon  Douglas  Gibson,  only  because  of  his  nuisance  value.
[Laughter.]

The team will be captained by President Mbeki, provided it  plays  overseas,
otherwise availability may be  a  problem.  [Laughter.]  The  imbongi,  with
skildvel [hide shield] and assegai will be the hon Buthelezi.

The referee, of course, is Adriaan Blaas-die-fluitjie  [blow  the  whistle],
and the media officer will be Carol Johnson - if she can sell the New NP  to
100 people, she will also be able to sell this team to  40  million  people.
[Laughter.]

Madam Speaker, you will be the coach, but please,  no  Kamp  Staaldraad,  we
suffer enough in Parliament. [Laughter.]

To all the members,  everything  of  the  best,  a  peaceful  and  enriching
festive season, and may we see you all here  again  next  year.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms T E MILLIN: That is really unfair to have to follow  such  an  act.  Well
done, Cassie.

Hon Speaker, hon colleagues on all sides of this House,  on  behalf  of  the
IAM,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  heartfelt  best  wishes  to   all   my
parliamentary colleagues, and particularly to the various Whips, as well  as
to all the parliamentary support staff, all the officials and  everyone  who
has been so helpful and who has really done so much  to  ease  me  into  the
workings of the National Assembly earlier this year.

I pray that all of you enjoy a healthy, happy and peaceful recess with  your
families and loved ones, and that we may  all  safely  return  next  year  -
probably only for a very short time - refreshed and ready for whatever  2004
may hold for us. I thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam  Speaker,  may  I  please  seize
this opportunity with both hands to thank the  presiding  officers  for  the
indelible marks made forever on our minds, and  for  your  guidance  on  the
proceedings  of  this  House.  We  thank  you  for  your  guidance  on   the
proceedings  of  this  House.  We  thank  the  Presidency  for  the  immense
contributions it makes, adding to the vibrancy  of  debate  on  this  public
platform.

We also thank  Ministers,  Deputy  Ministers,  as  well  as  the  chairs  of
committees and Whips of all parties for their preoccupation  with  the  nuts
and bolts that keep the engine running. It has been a marathon year  in  the
service of our country and people. We thank all the members  of  this  House
for hanging in there. To  the  Table  staff,  Legislation  and  Proceedings,
service officers, catering and security  services,  Mamabolo,  Kallie  Pauw,
Goskar,  Jenny,  Hugo,  Sis  Joyce,  Coert  Smit,  Charlotte  Rademeyer   in
Questions - we take our hats off to all of you.

To all the support staff of all parties, to each and every soul  whose  life
is spent feeding on this,  holding  on  to  the  noble  aspirations  of  our
people; to all we say: Let us continue serving  our  beautiful  country  and
our people. We thank you.

To members of the media, in particular the Press Gallery Association -  your
role is invaluable. We do not have the words, you do:  Thank  you.  May  you
all, your families and friends have an enjoyable holiday season. Thank  you,
Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, we have a few months left of the first  decade  of
our democracy. We may want to take that time to reflect,  not  just  on  the
past, but on the lessons of the past, so we can hand  them  on  to  the  new
Parliament, where we have to look at whether we are there or not. It is  our
duty to hand on our experience so that it can then be built on and  the  new
group can build upon what we leave.

In the first five years of our democracy we  created  a  constitution  which
others might have said was undemocratic, because we said we would not  allow
elections for five years. I do not think we remember  that  and  the  reason
was that we said that whatever the results, we all had  to  live  with  them
for five years and learn to work together during those five years.  I  think
we have learnt to live with each other. I think we have learnt to live  with
each other and co-operate, though we all like to believe  we  don't,  except
during the end of year farewell speeches.

Otherwise, we have worked well. We have created good laws. With many we  had
to amend more than we should have; but I think we have learnt  on  the  way.
Therefore, I think we need to be aware of just how much  we  have  achieved.
The coverage we get is not always good, but we should  not  buy  into  that.
Generally this has been a very  hardworking  Parliament  and  one  that  has
achieved much. One just has to look across and visit other  parliaments  and
see the regard they have for this Parliament and its members.

Whatever people say, members are not layabouts. Members  have  worked  very,
very  hard.  [Applause.]  They  have  worked  hard,   often   in   difficult
circumstances. I am sure Sybil Seaton will appreciate it when  I  say,  with
not sufficient resources, and I am sure all of you will say  that.  We  also
need in the future to see how we  use  whatever  resources  we  can  acquire
better, manage them better. We have achieved much and I would like to  thank
you all for the effort that has gone into that achievement.

I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out  whether  members  keep  the
Whips in order, or the Whips keep the members in order. I am afraid  I  have
not quite resolved that. I will  continue  to  try  and  resolve  that,  but
whichever way it went, thank you,  members  and  Whips  for  keeping  order.
Someone referred to the problems of Taiwan, Korea and more recently, to  the
national problems in Georgia regarding parliament.

I speculated as I was watching it on television where there was an  invasion
of their parliament, and speakers and the president of the  country  had  to
be taken out. South Africa's democracy is not like that.  We  have  had  two
elections, we have changed and accepted the results. I believe  we  will  go
into the new election and accept the results and live  with  them,  whatever
they are.

We have managed what we have also because  of  the  support  of  the  staff.
First and foremost, I want to thank the staff of the National Assembly,  the
Table staff under the Secretary of the National Assembly, Mr  Hahndiek,  the
service officers, the  sound  system  operators  -  because  technically  we
needed much support, which I hope will be remedied by the time we come  back
- the interpreters,  the  language  services,  the  many,  many  people  who
sometimes are not visible on the floor but who actually enable the  Assembly
to function.

I would like to thank the Secretary, Deputy  and  Assistant  Secretaries  to
Parliament and all the different divisions who  have  provided  services  to
facilitate our work - sometimes we say  to  frustrate  our  work  -  but  on
balance it has been to facilitate and make it easier. I do not want to  omit
thanking the catering services, because whatever our comments  are  about  a
particular meal, they have provided sustenance regularly and  on  time.  The
cleaners and security staff may have thumped  the  cars,  but  basically  we
have been protected. In troubled times that is something we need to be  very
grateful for. It has been a kind of security that  a  parliament  needs  and
that is not obvious. We are not overwhelmed by security,  and  yet  I  think
every one of us has been able to feel secure as  we  have  carried  out  our
work.

To the members of the press: I would like to thank  them  for  coverage.  In
extent, it has improved. If I had a wish for them,  I  think  I  would  wish
them a little more discerning eyes in the new year so  that  they  see  much
more, and more space from their editors so they  can  give  more  space  and
coverage  to  what  happens  in  Parliament.  I  would  like  to  thank  the
Parliamentary Office-Bearers, the Chair and Deputy Chair of Committees,  the
chairs  of  committees,  the  Parliamentary   Liaison   Offices   and   most
importantly, the Deputy Speaker, who has always been  there,  supportive  in
the overall management of this institution.

To all of you,  I  wish  you  a  well-earned  rest,  followed  by  enjoyable
festivities, invigorating electioneering - as if I needed to remind you  all
of that - and to suggest that you are stimulated when you return in  January
as we go into our next decade. I want to wish  you  the  fulfilment  of  all
your wishes, but that wish rather fills me with trepidation. I had  to  cope
this last year,  as  we  have  shifted  from  13  to  18  parties,  and  the
trepidation comes - and if all your wishes are granted - I will  have  seven
or eight majority parties to cope with. And I don't know how  any  presiding
officer would ever be able to manage that process.

Maybe the advice given by Mr Aucamp about the  coaching  methods  and  team-
building spirit may  be  something  that  will  be  needed  with  that  many
parties. Whatever it is, I hope the laughter he  engendered  in  this  House
will stimulate you throughout the rest of this year and into the  new  year.
We will see you all in January: refreshed, invigorated, champing at the  bit
to finish the last few  months  of  this  first  decade  of  South  Africa's
democratic  Parliament.  Go  well,  come   back   safely   and   come   back
reinvigorated. Thank you. [Applause.]
