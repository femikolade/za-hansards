                            QUORUM IN THE CHAMBER

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Order!  Hon  members,  I  find  it  extremely
unacceptable, both  to  our  nation  and  to  ourselves  as  elected  public
representatives, that we cannot begin our sessions because we do not have  a
quorum. I think this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour  on  the  part  of
members of Parliament.
As elected representatives, our duty is to ensure that  we  pass  and  enact
the laws of our land, so that they may become part of that which guides  our
nation. I am absolutely horrified that we had to hold back starting  at  the
agreed time because we did not have a quorum.

I am asking the Table to provide me with the names of the  members  who  are
not in the House, so that those names may be forwarded to the  provinces  to
indicate  to  the  legislatures  how  the  representatives   designated   by
provinces are  conducting  themselves  in  terms  of  their  responsibility,
because we are not keeping up with the work that we should be doing.

The commentator on the SABC, who was waiting  for  this  session  to  begin,
said that even the Minister was on time and the House was not  quorate.  So,
we are pleased that  the  Minister  is  here,  but  I  think  it  is  really
unacceptable that our House was not able to meet on time, merely because  of
the quorum. There are no committee meetings, so there  are  no  reasons  for
members not to be here. I really think it is  unacceptable  and  I  hope  we
will get an explanation from the Whips as to exactly what occurred.

We will proceed then. Is there any member who wishes to  give  notice  of  a
motion?

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr G R KRUMBOCK: Chair, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the House I will propose:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that no matter how much spin is employed and no matter how many
       speeches and notices of motion politicians  make,  in  elections  the
       voters will always have the final say;


  (2) in the by-elections of Beacon  Bay,  Pietermaritzburg  and  Nelspruit
       that took place on yesterday on 27 August,  the  voters  have  spoken
       decisively and finally;
  (3) in Beacon Bay, the DA held  the  seat  in  a  tough  election  battle
       against the ANC by 1 964 votes to 1 852 in a remarkably high poll  of
       44%. The New NP could not field a candidate;


  (4) in Nelspruit, in a ward held by the New NP as recently as  1998,  the
       DA took 88% of the vote compared to the New NP's 5,8% of the vote;


  (5) similarly, in Pietermaritzburg South the DA polled 77%  of  the  vote
       compared to the New NP's 4%; and


  (6) these results prove yet again that the election in 2004 will be a two-
       horse race between the ANC on the one hand, and the DA and its allies
       on the other, with all other parties now reduced to irrelevancy.

[Interjections.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek sal by  die  volgende  sitting  van  die
Raad voorstel:
  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van  die  DA  se  woordvoerder  oor  grondsake,  mnr  Dan
       Maluleke, se voorstel dat die restitusieproses heropen moet word;


  (2) daarvan bewus is dat die President van Suid-Afrika  die  proses,  wat
       die DA nou wil uitrek, teen 2005 afgehandel wil hê sodat  onsekerheid
       uit die weg geruim kan word;


  (3) voorts daarvan kennis  neem  dat  die  voorstel  begrotingsrealiteite
       ignoreer en onhaalbare verwagtinge skep;


  (4) van mening is dat dit uit mnr Maluleke se voorstel blyk  dat  die  DA
       nie omgee dat 'n Zimbabwe-situasie in Suid-Afrika bevorder word  nie;
       en


  (5) 'n ernstige beroep op die DA doen om te besin oor hierdie  benadering
       en daarvan af te sien, aangesien Suid-Afrika nie die gevolge  verdien
       wat dit inhou nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I shall move at the next  sitting  of  the
House:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the proposal  made  by  the  DA  spokesperson  on  Land
       Affairs, Mr Dan Maluleke, that the restitution process be reopened;


  (2) is aware that the President of South Africa wants the process,  which
       the DA now wants to be extended, to be finalised by 2005 so that  all
       uncertainty can be removed;


  (3) further takes note that this proposal ignores budgetary realities and
       creates unattainable expectations;


  (4) is of the opinion that it appears from Mr  Maluleke's  proposal  that
       the DA does not care that a Zimbabwe situation is being  promoted  in
       South Africa; and


  (5) makes an earnest appeal to the DA to reflect on this approach and  to
       relinquish it, since South Africa does not deserve  the  consequences
       of this.]

                        EU GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) given the severe caution with which countries in the EU have  treated
       the possible use of genetically modified (GM)  foods,  and  the  many
       scientific question marks that go unanswered, calls upon the Minister
       for Agriculture and Land Affairs to place a moratorium on the further
       use of GM crops and foods produced from GM raw materials;
  (2) notes that the  EU  is  South  Africa's  most  important  market  for
       agricultural produce and goods, and that we need to be  very  careful
       not to find our products fenced off from the EU market by regulations
       in the future - we need to be in step and not out of step  with  that
       market;


  (3) further notes our limited research capacity and the fact that we  are
       a mega diverse country with a host  of  botanical  species  and  many
       botanical hot spots, and we need to be very clear as to the  possible
       knock-on effects of GM plants on our eco-system;


  (4) also notes the fact that some of our neighbours,  like  Zambia,  have
       banned the use of GM grains; and


  (5) calls upon the Government to proceed with caution in the field of  GM
       foods.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to the motion? There  is
an objection. The motion will therefore become notice of a motion.

                         NEVIRAPINE IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the newspaper reports that Nevirapine is being  distributed  to
       all 49 hospitals which offer maternity services in KwaZulu-Natal;


  (2) further notes that this was announced by the  Health  MEC,  Dr  Zweli
       Mkhize,  in  his  report  on  women-related  issues  tabled  in   the
       legislature in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday, 26 August 2003;


  (3)  believes  that  this  Nevirapine  roll-out  programme  is  also  now
       available in seven of the 10 community health centres and 228 of  the
       425 primary health care clinics; and


  (4) therefore commends the Health MEC for  the  part  he  has  played  in
       ensuring the distribution of Nevirapine in these hospitals.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

            ZIMBABWE SECURITY OFFICIALS TO STAFF POLLING STATIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms C BOTHA: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note of the Zimbabwean High Court decision to allow the use  of
       soldiers, policemen and  other  armed  security  officials  to  staff
       polling stations in the coming elections;


  (2)  observes  the  position  during  the  recent  Rwandan   presidential
       election, in which security personnel operated in a  noticeably  low-
       keyed fashion to secure voting stations, while polling stations  were
       staffed by volunteer officials;


  (3) notes that the counting of the votes took place in full view  of  the
       public and in the same locale where the voting took place;


  (4) commends the remarkable achievement  of  national  unity  in  Rwanda,
       where a member of the minority group was  overwhelmingly  elected  as
       president, only 9 years after the much publicised genocide that  took
       place in that country; and


  (5) requests the Government to put pressure on Zimbabwe  to  follow  this
       admirable example of African democracy in action.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there an objection to that motion? There  is
an objection, so the motion will become notice of a motion.

                        SUCCESSFUL RWANDAN ELECTIONS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr B J TOLO: Chair, I want to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with satisfaction the successful Rwandan elections  which  were
       held over the past two days;


  (2) congratulates and thanks the Rwandans for successfully holding  their
       elections without incidents of violence;


  (3) also notes that voters demonstrated their determination to  transcend
       the political and artificial ethnic divide in order  to  usher  in  a
       long-lasting peace in their country;


  (4) calls upon those who could  not  secure  more  votes  to  accept  the
       outcome of the elections and to support the  new  government  in  its
       efforts of rebuilding the country; and


  (5) further notes with satisfaction the role that South Africa played and
       is still playing in brokering peace in that country and other African
       states.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              TABLING OF WHITE PAPER ON TRADITIONAL LEADERSHIP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, I want to move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) thanks and  congratulates  the  Minister  for  Provincial  and  Local
       Government and his department for finally tabling the White Paper  on
       Traditional  Leadership  that  outlines  the  function  and  role  of
       traditional leaders;


  (2) is of the view  that  this  will  go  a  long  way  in  reducing  the
       unnecessary tension between the Government  and  traditional  leaders
       and will enable delivery of social services to be expedited in  rural
       areas where delivery was not possible because of these tensions;


  (3) notes that all stakeholders are negotiating in good faith; and


  (4) calls  upon  all  those  who  have  developed  an  interest  in  this
       institution, and those custodians of our rich culture, to  give  this
       process a chance.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: A go  na  le  yo  o  sa  dumalaneng  le  se  se
builweng ke Kgosi Mokoena? [Is there anyone who does  not  agree  with  what
Kgoshi Mokoena has said?]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

   NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL
                        MANAGEMENT: BIODIVERSITY BILL

               (Consideration of Bills and of Reports thereon)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL  AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson  and  hon
members, it gives me great pleasure to introduce the National  Environmental
Management  Amendment  Bill  and  the  National  Environmental   Management:
Biodiversity Bill in this House.

Both these Bills have travelled quite a long path  before  being  considered
by the National Council of Provinces. You would be interested to  know  that
these Bills have had a particularly long gestation period, and part  of  the
reason for that is the impact this Bill has on both national and  provincial
Governments and on the environment departments in provincial governments.

It is far-reaching, indeed, and in many ways it  is  revolutionary.  I  have
had numerous discussions in Minmec with the provincial MECs  on  this  Bill.
There has also been a great deal of consultation  and  meetings  and  to-ing
and fro-ing between the officials  of  provincial  and  national  Government
departments, and local government has also been consulted in this matter.

Perhaps, before I speak about the  Bills  themselves,  I  should  put  these
Bills in the context of the democracy that  we  are  experiencing  in  South
Africa at present. The environmental right in our  Constitution,  as  stated
in section 24, enjoins  the  Government  to  ensure  a  healthy  and  decent
environment, conducive to the well-being  of  all  South  Africans,  and  to
ensure that there is legislation in place to achieve this objective.
Therefore,  after  extensive  consultation,  way  back  in   1997   already,
Government published the  White  Paper  on  Environmental  Management  which
acknowledged the need  for  the  fundamental  reform  of  the  environmental
management legislation in this country. In pursuance of this objective,  the
Government at the time embarked on a law reform  programme  which  continues
up to today. One of the most important products of the law reform  programme
has been the passing of the  1998  National  Environmental  Management  Act,
which is a seminal piece of legislation. Apart from setting a framework  for
environmental  legislation,  it  lays  down   a   set   of   core   national
environmental management principles which all other legislation must  adhere
to.

I am saying that because, as you will notice even  from  the  title  of  the
Bill, it starts  off  by  saying  that  National  Environmental  Management:
Biodiversity Bill. It is part of a  larger  group  of  legislation,  all  of
which is derived from the 1998 fundamental legislation  on  the  environment
passed by Parliament at the time.
The National Environmental Management Act sets  the  overall  tone  for  all
Government departments to  adhere  to,  and  it  provides  a  framework  for
sectoral legislation. The two  Bills  that  we  have  before  us  here  must
accordingly be seen against this background and, therefore, should  be  read
within the framework of the National Environmental Management Act.

I  can  mention  that,  in  embarking  on  this  environmental  law   reform
programme, we have to constantly  be  vigilant  and  ensure  that  while  we
protect the environment we must, at the same time, not  lose  sight  of  the
other two pillars of sustainable development; namely,  economic  growth  and
social development. This country has embraced the globally accepted  concept
of sustainable development; one which was again endorsed by heads  of  state
at the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development.  This  concept  says  that
sustainable development has three pillars  to  it.  The  protection  of  the
environment cannot happen in isolation of  the  needs  of  people.  That  is
basically what it says, and that is  why  social  development  and  economic
growth are always tied  in  to  everything  we  do  when  it  comes  to  the
protection of the environment.

The motivation for the National Environmental Management: Biodiversity  Bill
has its origins in the Convention on Biological Diversity which  is  one  of
the outcomes of the Rio Earth Summit, the predecessor  to  the  WSSD.  South
Africa has subsequently ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity  and
thus has an international obligation to give it domestic effect.

The philosophy behind the convention is very much in line  with  the  ideals
of our  young  democracy.  Its  stated  objective  is  to  provide  for  the
conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.

It must be stated here that all this happens within  the  context  of  South
Africa's unique biodiversity. Even now,  very  few  South  Africans  realise
that South  Africa  is  considered  to  have  the  third  highest  level  of
biological diversity in the  world.  We  are  one  of  the  most  biodiverse
countries to be found anywhere  in  the  world.  So,  one  of  our  greatest
natural assets is the extreme richness  of  our  plant,  animal  and  insect
life. We are extremely fortunate in that regard. This places,  in  a  sense,
more of a responsibility on us to ensure that we deal with this adequately.

The old orthodox thinking of biodiversity  conservation  has  been  that  of
creating parks. Now, parks are something that we are  very  much  in  favour
of, but it was always thought that when you have an important  ecosystem,  a
fragile ecosystem, or one with  a  high  level  of  biodiversity,  that  you
should put a fence around it and create  a  park  and  protect  the  natural
environment within the park.

The modern thinking, which is very much what this Bill is trying to  do,  is
that biodiversity does not only exist within the confines  of  a  park.  You
cannot place a neat fence or boundary around an ecosystem. The  richness  of
our biological diversity extends well beyond national and provincial parks.

Therefore, you will find that this Bill talks about what is  referred  to  a
bioregional approach to conservation, so that the national parks  themselves
are seen as the core of what is a much wider bioregion as such.  This  Bill,
for the first time, requires that a national  bioregional  plan  has  to  be
developed and tabled. If this Bill is approved by Parliament,  and  once  it
is enacted, it will require that within three years, Government  would  have
to table a bioregional plan, taking into account the whole  complex  mix  of
ecosystems that we have in this country.

The Bill also goes into a number of specifics,  one  of  which  is  that  it
deals with threatened ecosystems and what to  do  about  them.  It  empowers
Government, firstly, to identify threatened ecosystems, and to list  all  of
the threatened and protected ecosystems that we have  in  the  country,  and
then  to  take  measures  to  ensure  the  protection  of  these  threatened
ecosystems.

It does the same as far as threatened species are  concerned.  There  are  a
number of plant and animal species in our country which  are  under  threat.
Government is required to make a list of these so that everybody would  know
which these are,  and  then  to  develop  a  strategy  around  each  of  the
threatened species that we have in this country.

It also deals with the management  and  the  strategy  to  deal  with  alien
invasive species. One of the biggest challenges that a country with  a  high
biodiversity faces, as is the case in South Africa, is the impact  of  alien
invasive species. Not only does it destroy  or  threaten  our  biodiversity,
but it also impacts very directly on the livelihoods of people.

We have seen, I think over the past seven or eight years, that  the  Working
for Water Programme has been able to show that the  proliferation  of  alien
invasive species, in fact, depletes  the  country's  very  rare  and  scarce
water resources. So, again, this  Bill  gives  a  comprehensive  legislative
framework in order to deal with  alien  invasive  species.  This  Bill  also
deals with another important matter which has for  a  very  long  time  been
ignored, not only at national level, but also at  international  level,  and
that is bioprospecting and the exploitation of indigenous genetic  material,
plant material and animal material.

We have had a situation for a very long time, probably since  the  beginning
of colonialism in South  Africa,  where  indigenous  South  African  genetic
resources have been exploited  and  patented  by  companies  in  the  United
States and elsewhere in the world. Other people have  been  making  lots  of
money out of South Africa's indigenous genetic material without any benefit-
sharing or without any benefit accruing, either to South Africa or to  local
communities.

This Bill, for the first time, seeks to regulate this. I must say that  it's
a matter which also came up very sharply at the World Summit on  Sustainable
Development. One of  the  decisions  of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable
Development, which everybody agreed to, was that a process should  begin  to
negotiate an international instrument, probably a  convention,  to  regulate
the exploitation of indigenous genetic material.

Then, the Bill is also aimed at modernising and upgrading  the  SA  National
Botanical Institute. As you know, the National Botanical Institute has  done
a great deal of work  in  categorising  the  botanical  diversity  of  South
Africa. It  also  does  scientific  research  which  underpins  all  of  the
protection work we do. It is an institution that is globally recognised.

The aim of this Bill now is to transform the  National  Botanical  Institute
into what is referred to as the SA National Biodiversity  Institute,  Sanbi,
so that it should deal not only with the botanical aspect  of  biodiversity,
but also with the zoological aspect of biodiversity and the whole  range  of
biodiversity as such, because when one talks about  an  ecosystem  approach,
one cannot separate species within an ecosystem in the manner in which  they
impact on each other.  This  is  a  great  advance,  and  I  must  say  that
everybody concerned is extremely excited about  the  possible  establishment
of the SA National Botanical Institute.

We are also considering here today  the  National  Environmental  Management
Amendment Bill. It has been said that we have a comprehensive and  excellent
set of environmental laws on our Statute Book, but there has  often  been  a
concern  that  there  is  not  sufficient  teeth  for  enforcement  of   the
legislation that we have.

You would know that I have begun  a  process  of  dealing  with  enforcement
issues, for example, together with the Department of Justice, for the  first
time establishing an environmental court in  Hermanus.  This  is  new,  it's
path-breaking and it's already beginning  to  deliver  some  very  important
results. The intention is that this must be  expanded  to  other  geographic
areas and to other domains also, such as in areas  where  pollution  control
is a problem.

The amending Bill, accordingly, greatly beefs up the enforcement arm of  the
Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  and  other  departments,
particularly the sister departments in the  provinces  by  providing,  among
other matters, for environmental management inspectors, with powers  similar
to other inspectors in other departments.

As I've said, these two Bills  represent  a  very  important  stage  in  the
modernisation of the legislative framework as  far  as  the  environment  in
South Africa is concerned. It is not the last piece of legislation. It is  a
staging post to take us to new heights, and I'm sure that we  will  have  an
opportunity to bring you further pieces of legislation  dealing  with  other
aspects of environmental management. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chair, hon Minister and members of your  department,  hon
members in this House, the National Environmental  Management:  Biodiversity
Bill of 2003 and the National Environmental  Management  Amendment  Bill  of
2003 were introduced in the NCOP, where they were  referred  to  the  Select
Committee on  Land  and  Environmental  Affairs,  and  we  appreciated  this
arrangement.

Firstly,  the   National   Environmental   Management:   Biodiversity   Bill
establishes controls on  the  management  and  utilisation  of  species.  It
provides for the management and conservation of the biological diversity  of
South Africa and the long-term sustainable use of our biological resources.

The term ``biodiversity'' refers to the natural wealth of  the  earth,  that
is, the earth's web of life, consisting of millions of species  of  animals,
plants,  insects  and  minute  organisms  such  as  bacteria.  The  National
Environmental Management:  Biodiversity  Bill  of  2003  was  introduced  to
provide for the  establishment  of  a  National  Biodiversity  Institute  to
replace the current National Botanical Institute. The Bill also sets out  an
enabling  regulatory  framework  for  the  integrated  management  of  South
Africa's biodiversity.

The  principle  behind  the  Bill  was,  firstly,  to  provide,  within  the
framework of the National Environmental Management Act, for  the  management
and conservation of biological diversity within the Republic. Secondly,  the
aim was to provide for the use  of  indigenous  biological  resources  in  a
sustainable  manner.  Thirdly,  it  was  to  give  effect  to  international
agreements relating to biodiversity which are binding on  South  Africa,  as
well as providing a regulatory framework for a  co-operative  governance  in
biodiversity management and conservation.

In fulfilling the rights contained in section 24 of  the  Constitution,  the
state, through its organs, is required to  act  as  the  public  trustee  of
South Africa's biological diversity and its genetic resources.

Concerning its scope and application, this Bill applies in the whole of  the
Republic, including its territorial  waters,  exclusive  economic  zone  and
continental shelf, as described  in  the  Maritime  Zone  Act  of  1994.  It
further binds all the organs of state in the national, provincial and  local
spheres, subject to section 146 of the Constitution.

In ensuring that  there  is  equitable  sharing  of  benefits  arising  from
commercialisation through the bioprospecting of traditional uses,  the  Bill
provides that no holder of a permit may, for the purpose of  bioprospecting,
apply  or  exploit  any  traditional  uses  or  knowledge  of  any  specific
indigenous biological resource, unless that permit holder has  entered  into
a benefit-sharing agreement with the person  or  community  practising  that
traditional use or knowledge.

The Bill also intends to repeal the Forest Act of  1984  and,  as  from  the
date of repeal, all assets and liabilities, and all rights  and  obligations
of the National Botanical Institute will be vested in the proposed  National
Biodiversity Institute.

South Africa is the third most biologically diverse country  in  the  world,
as the Minister has rightly said, and as such, is  fully  cognisant  of  its
responsibilities  in  ensuring  that  its  valuable  natural  resources  are
protected and used sustainably. The Biodiversity  Bill  is  a  mechanism  to
ensure the management and conservation  of  biological  diversity  in  South
Africa.

It is evident, however, that the Bill  has  triggered  many  concerns  among
civil society. These concerns would best be elicited in  the  context  of  a
forum offered by public hearings. The provincial hearings  that  are  to  be
held in the future are therefore to be welcomed, as these  will  enable  the
provisions of the Bill to be  widely  discussed  and  also  enable  interest
groups to put forward their concerns and suggestions.

The National Environmental  Management  Amendment  Bill  of  2003  seeks  to
provide for co-operative environment governance by  establishing  principles
for decision-making on matters affecting the environment, institutions  that
will  promote  co-operative  governance  and  procedures  for  co-ordinating
environmental functions exercised by organs.

It further seeks to provide  for  national  and  provincial  supervision  of
environmental management functions, as well as creating a framework for  the
delegation of power by the Minister, the MECs for environmental affairs  and
municipalities. It  also  provides  for  the  designation  of  environmental
management inspectors by the Director-General  or  the  provincial  HOD,  as
well as for judicial matters of compliance enforcement.

Reference can be made to  clause  47(b)(1)  which  provides  that  when  any
provincial organ of state cannot or does not fulfil an obligation  in  terms
of a specific section of the  National  Environmental  Management  Act,  the
Minister may, in terms of section 100  of  the  Constitution,  intervene  by
taking any appropriate steps to ensure fulfilment of that obligation.

The insertion of a new chapter 9(a)  provides  for  the  administration  and
enforcement of specific environmental acts,  and  to  enable  the  Director-
General  or  a  provincial  HOD  to   designate   environmental   management
inspectors to implement this  function.  The  powers  of  these  inspectors,
inter alia, include the power to  arrest,  to  enter  and  search  premises,
land, waters and other places,  and  to  seize  certain  articles  that  are
suspected of being the proceeds of an offence.

Judicial matters, such as  offences  relating  to  environmental  management
inspectors, the cancellation of permits, the forfeiture  of  items  and  the
issuing of infringement notices are dealt with in part four of the Bill.

Finally, the Bill exempts the state of liability  for  any  damage  or  loss
caused by the exercise of any power or performance of any  duty  under  this
Act or any specific Environmental Management  Act,  unless  exercising  that
power was unlawful, negligent or in bad faith.

We support these two pieces of legislation. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Agb Voorsitter, toe die aarde geskape is,  is  Adam  en
Eva aangestel as die eerste bestuurders van die omgewing, en selfs  daar  is
sekere voorskrifte al oortree.  Die  omgewing,  met  al  sy  diversiteit  en
sensitiwiteit, is iets wat ons van ons voorouers geërf het, maar eintlik  is
dit iets wat ons aan ons kinders gaan nalaat. Ons  het  dit  net  van  hulle
geleen. Wanneer 'n mens iets erf, kan jy daarmee maak wat jy wil as  jy  nie
respek het vir die persoon by wie jy dit geërf het  nie,  maar  as  'n  mens
iets leen, dan gee jy dit gewoonlik in 'n beter toestand  terug  as  wat  jy
dit gekry het. En dit is presies wat hierdie twee wetsontwerpe in  wese  ook
met ons omgewing wil bereik.

Dit is egter jammer dat daar nog steeds  soveel  roekeloosheid  bestaan  oor
die instandhouding van ons omgewing, maar die Nuwe  NP  wil  egter  die  agb
Minister en sy departement bedank vir hul volharding met die nodige  beleid,
wetgewing en die implementering van wetgewing, maar  ook  die  opvoeding  en
bemagtiging van ons mense wat onverskillig hierteenoor staan.  Die  Nuwe  NP
ondersteun die wetsontwerpe.

Dit is egter jammer, Voorsitter, dat ons in hierdie Parlement mense het  wat
die emosie en nood van ander mense vir eie aansien en 'n paar stemme  in  'n
volgende verkiesing misbruik.  Ek  het  in  verlede  Vrydag  se  Die  Burger
hierdie foto gesien. En dié van u wat dit nie kan sien nie, ek wil  dit  net
aan u verduidelik. Hier op 'n boot staan die leier van die DA  saam  met  'n
klompie vissers. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Mnr C ACKERMANN: Dit is die eerste keer in sy lewe op 'n boot.

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: U sal ook sien, hy staan daar op 'n  boot  waarvan  die
ankertou nie eens opgelig is nie. Hy is veilig in die hawe,  maar  wat  doen
hy? Hy kritiseer die agb Minister wat 'n beleid en  die  implementering  van
'n beleid by mekaar  wil  laat  uitkom.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Ek  wonder  tog:
Hoekom het die agb Tony Leon, die leier van die DA, nou  toegetree  tot  die
debat oor die vissers en die kwotas? Hier is tog 'n woordvoerder in  hierdie
Raad, naamlik die agb Versfeld - en ek  is  jammer  sy  is  afwesig  vandag.
Volgens hul standaarde word hul sukses gemeet aan publisiteit,  en  sy  doen
baie goeie werk met haar harde werk en trane. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Of  is  dit
nou omdat die  DA  die  vissers  se  stemme  nodig  het?  Of  is  hier  iets
diepliggends? Gaan dit moontlik oor die klag wat mnr Albert  van  den  Berg,
'n visser, teen agb Versfeld gaan  lê  het  oor  aansoeke  en  geld  wat  sy
vermoedelik nie ingedien het nie, en daardeur vissers te na gekom en van  'n
bestaansloon beroof het? Die tyd sal moet leer. [Tussenwerpsels.]

'n Visserskuit is tog gebou om op die oop see te wees, maar  die  leier  van
die DA staan in die hawe, lekker vasgeanker. Hierdie foto  is  'n  ``posed''
foto, net om in die koerant te kom - waarmee hulle dan ook geslaag het.  Dit
is net so vals soos die beloftes wat hulle aan die vissers van hierdie  land
maak. Die DA is nie in staat om een visserskwota, een permit of een reg  aan
enige mense toe te ken nie. Hulle is geïsoleerd. Hulle het geen inspraak  by
die agb Minister nie. Hulle is in 'n  hoekie  saam  met  die  media  in  die
koerante. Dis al. Hulle gaan heel waarskynlik  dreig  met  hofsake.  Dit  is
hulle styl, of met kommissies wat aangestel moet word,  maar,  ``so  what''.
Dit spreek kiesers se emosie aan, maar die  probleem  word  nie  aangespreek
nie. Dit word in baie gevalle net vererger.

Wil die  DA  hierdie  probleem  rêrig  opgelos  hê?  Ek  dink  nie  so  nie.
Voorsitter, u moet onthou dat hulle mos gesê het: Hoe slegter dit met  Suid-
Afrika gaan, hoe beter gaan dit met die DA. En  die  vissers  moet  dit  ook
weet. Hoe slegter dit met die vissers gaan, hoe beter gaan dit met  die  DA!
Want dan kan hulle raas en blaas en ``pose'' op  bote  om  die  koerante  te
haal.

Die  agb  Minister  het   vandag   ingrypende   aankondigings   gemaak   oor
langlynregte en permitte. Ons verwelkom dit en ons sê baie dankie.  En  ons,
die Nuwe NP en sy strukture, is beskikbaar om die 965 bona fide-vissers  aan
wie die Minister regte wil toeken, te help identifiseer. Die  Minister  moet
net onthou: Die DA gaan hierdie aankondigings  nou  opeis  as  hulle  sukses
deur hul leier wat op 'n boot gestaan het, en die ander druk wat hulle op  u
toegepas het totdat u geswig het. Ons weet dit is 'n klomp snert,  maar  die
vissers moet dit ook nou weet.

Daar  is  sakelui  wat  besig  is  om  die  African  Aqua  and   Mariculture
Development Corporation op  die  been  te  bring,  wat  gaan  help  met  die
ontwikkeling van hierdie industrie in Suid-Afrika en  in  Afrika.  Dit  gaan
die tekorte van die marine voorraad help aanvul, en van die  werkgeleenthede
wat verlore mag gaan oor die krimpende marinebronne,  kan  vervang.  Hierdie
inisiatief word wyd ondersteun, en ek sal dit graag met u en  u  departement
wil deel en bespreek. Ek dank u. [Applous.]  [Tyd  verstreke.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Hon Chairperson, when the earth was created,  Adam  and
Eve were appointed as the first managers of the environment, and  even  then
certain prescriptions  were  transgressed.  The  environment  with  all  its
diversity  and  sensitivity  is  something  that  we  inherited   from   our
forefathers, but it is actually something that we are going to leave to  our
children. We only borrowed it from them. When one  inherits  something,  one
can do with it what one wants to if one does not  respect  the  person  from
whom one had inherited it. However, when one borrows something, one  usually
returns it in a better condition than when one  received  it.  And  this  is
precisely  what  these  two  Bills  essentially  aim  to  achieve  with  our
environment.

It is a pity, however, that there is still such recklessness with regard  to
maintaining our environment, but the New NP, however,  wants  to  thank  the
Minister and his department for not only persisting with  essential  policy,
legislation  and  the  implementation  of  legislation,  but  also  for  the
education and empowerment of our people who are  indifferent  to  this.  The
new NP supports the Bills.

It is regrettable, however, Chairperson,  that  there  are  people  in  this
Parliament who abuse the emotion and need of  other  people  for  their  own
esteem and for a few votes  in  the  next  election.  I  recently  saw  this
photograph that was published in Die Burger of last  Friday.  And  those  of
you who cannot see it, I just want to explain it to you. Here on a boat  the
leader of the DA is standing with a few fishers. [Interjections.]

Mr C ACKERMANN: It is probably his first time on a boat in his life.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: You will also see, he is standing there  on  a  boat  of
which the anchor rope has  not  even  been  lifted.  He  is  safely  in  the
harbour, but what does he do? He criticises the hon Minister who desires  to
allow  policy  and  its  implementation  to  link  up  with   one   another.
[Interjections.] I nevertheless wonder: Why  has  the  hon  Tony  Leon,  the
leader of the DA, entered the debate about the fishers and the  quotas  now?
There is a spokesperson here in this House, namely the hon Versfeld - and  I
am sorry that she is absent  today.  According  to  their  standards,  their
success is measured in terms of publicity,  and  she  does  very  good  work
through her hard work and tears. [Interjections.] Or is it now  because  the
DA need the fishers' votes? Or is there something more deep-seated here?  Is
it possibly about the charge that Mr Albert van den Berg, a  fisherman,  had
laid against Mrs Versfeld about applications and money that  she  presumably
did not submit and, in so doing, offended the fishers and robbed them  of  a
subsistence wage? Time will have to tell. [Interjections.]

A fishing boat is surely built to be on the open sea, but the leader of  the
DA is standing in the harbour, nicely anchored. This photograph is  a  posed
photo, just to get into the newspaper - in which they also succeeded. It  is
just as false as the promises they make to the fishers of this country.  The
DA is unable to allocate a single fishing quota, permit or right to  anyone.
They are isolated. They have no say with the hon Minister.  They  are  in  a
corner with the media  in  the  newspapers.  That  is  all.  They  are  most
probably going to threaten with court cases. It  is  their  style,  or  with
commissions that must be appointed, but so what? It addresses  the  emotions
of voters, but the problem is not addressed. In many cases it is  only  made
worse.

Does the DA really want to have this problem resolved? I do  not  think  so.
Chairperson, you must remember that they have  said:  The  worse  off  South
Africa is, the better off the DA is. And the fishers must  also  know  this.
The worse off the fishers are, the better off the DA is! Because  then  they
can huff and puff and pose on boats to make the newspapers.

The hon  Minister  today  made  far-reaching  announcements  about  longline
rights and permits. We welcome this and say thank you  very  much.  And  we,
the New NP and its structures, are available to help  to  identify  the  965
bone fide fishers to whom  the  Minister  wishes  to  allocate  rights.  The
Minister should just remember: The DA is going to claim these  announcements
as being their success through their leader who had stood on a boat and  the
pressure that they applied to you until you gave in. We know it  is  a  load
of rubbish, but the fishers should also know this now.

There are businesspeople  who  are  busy  launching  the  African  Aqua  and
Mariculture Development Corporation  which  is  going  to  assist  with  the
development of this industry in South Africa and  Africa.  It  is  going  to
assist with augmenting the shortfalls in marine stocks, and may be  able  to
replace some of the job opportunities that may be lost  owing  to  dwindling
marine resources. This initiative is widely supported and I should  like  to
share  and  discuss  this  with  you  and  your  department.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.] [Time expired.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Agb lede, ek is  baie  bly  dat  agb  lede  ook
gebruik maak van ander tale. [Hon members, I am very glad that  hon  members
also speak other languages.] It is very important. Well done. [Applause.]

Ms B N DLULANE: Mhlalingaphambili, Mphathiswa ohloniphekileyo, silapha  kule
ngxoxo namhlanje, kwaye siyavuyiswa  bubukho  bakho.  [Chairperson  and  hon
Minister, we are here taking part in this debate  today  and  your  presence
makes us happy.]

The  two  Bills  that  are  currently  before  us  seek  to  strengthen  the
commitment we have made in terms of the  National  Environmental  Management
Act. In the words of our Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,
Comrade Valli Moosa, I quote:


  It will take the country into a modern period of environmental management
  and regulation.

Our environment plays an important role in meeting the development needs  of
our people in the new democratic South  Africa.  Our  country  is  currently
undergoing a major process of socioeconomic transformation  as  it  attempts
to correct the negative  impact  of  the  previous  political  regimes.  The
environmental damage in our country, which is a result of years of  neglect,
is massive. As we set on the course of bettering the  lives  of  people,  we
need to find ways to harness the positive links between development and  the
environment so that each objective promotes the other.

Utshilo apha uMphathiswa okokuba ngoko ibikade ingenamazinyo.  Yiyo  le  nto
sisenza le ntetho namhlanje,  sizama  ukufakelela  amazinyo.  [The  Minister
said here that it had no teeth then. That is why we are having  this  debate
today; we are trying to give it teeth.]

Section 24 of the Constitution states that:


  Everyone has the right -


  (a) to an environment that is not harmful to their health  or  wellbeing;
       and


  (b) to have the environment protected for the benefit of the present  and
       future generations, through reasonable legislative and other measures
       that -


       (i)  prevent pollution and ecological degradation,


       (ii) promote conservation; and


       (iii)      secure ecologically sustainable  development  and  use  of
              natural resources, while promoting  justifiable  economic  and
              social development.

The ANC-led Government's commitment to giving effect  to  the  environmental
rights enshrined in the  Constitution  is  evident  from  the  enactment  of
various pieces of environmental legislation since 1996, the  most  important
of which is the National Environmental Management Act.

NEMA's  primary  purpose  is  to  provide  for  co-operative   environmental
governance by establishing principles for  decision-making  on  all  matters
affecting the environment. In the past, responsibility for  the  environment
was divided between many different  Government  departments,  including  the
relevant  provincial  authorities.  As  a   result,   the   enforcement   of
environmental laws in South Africa has been unco-ordinated.

Yiyo   loo   nto   ke   sisithi   abaphathiswa    kumaphondo    mabangoyiki,
mabangangcangcazeli xa uMphathiswa okundlunkulu efaka esi  sihlomelo.  [That
is why we are saying  that  provincial  MECs  should  not  be  afraid;  they
shouldn't shiver when the national Minister makes this amendment.]

The following national  departments  administer  and  enforce  environmental
laws in South Africa: The Departments of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism,
Water Affairs and Forestry, Minerals and  Energy,  Transport,  Health,  Land
Affairs and Agriculture.

The key objective of NEMA is, therefore, to promote an  integrated  and  co-
ordinated approach to environmental concerns in the policy processes of  all
national  departments.  This  is  to   address   the   fragmentation   which
characterised the administration of environmental laws in  South  Africa  in
the past.

Moving on to the National Environmental  Management  Biodiversity  Bill,  it
provides, in  essence,  for  the  regulation  of  biological  resources  and
activities to ensure the long-term sustainability  of  biological  resources
and the equitable sharing of benefits derived from them.

The Bill provides  for  implementation,  by  the  Minister,  of  a  national
biodiversity framework to provide for  an  integrated,  co-ordinated  and  a
uniform approach to biodiversity management and conservation by all  spheres
of  government,  NGOs,  the  private  sector,   local   communities,   other
stakeholders and the public.

The purpose is to monitor the conservation status of various  components  of
South Africa's biodiversity and to promote biodiversity  research.  It  also
deals with the endangered or protected species,  with  the  aim  to  protect
them so as to ensure  their  survival  in  the  world,  to  give  effect  to
international agreements  relating  to  international  trade  in  endangered
species. This is to ensure that the  commercial  utilisation  of  biological
diversity is managed in an ecologically sustainable way.

In addition, the Bill also  regulates  bioprospecting  involving  indigenous
biological resources. Our people have been  very  resourceful  in  terms  of
identifying the  usefulness  of  certain  indigenous  biological  resources.
Ndithetha  ngamaxhwele  akowethu.  [I  am  talking  about  our   traditional
healers.]

Their knowledge must be protected by allowing them to share equally  in  the
benefits  arising  from  the  commercialisation  of  indigenous   biological
resources.

Yiyo  ke  loo  nto  uMphathiswa  eye   wagqiba   ekubeni   kubekho   ulawulo
ngokubhekisele kulo  mba,  kungasuke  kungene  abantu  bamanye  amazwe  beze
kuthabatha, mhlawumbi baxobule imithi ethile ukwenzela ukuba bona  bafumane.
Kufuneka kubekho ulawulo lwayo loo ko, njengoko kusenzeka. [That is why  the
Minister decided to effect control of this matter; so that  no  one  from  a
foreign country could enter and maybe pluck from a certain  tree  for  their
own benefit. There should be control over that, as it does happen.]

We certainly do not want to expose our people to losing their right  to  our
own biodiversity by having genetic material patented elsewhere in the  world
- the hon Minister mentioned that - which does not benefit South Africa.

The National Environmental Management Amendment Bill addresses  the  current
lack of effective enforcement and implementation of environmental laws  such
as NEMA. It is this lack of enforcement that has created  opportunities  for
poachers to continue depleting our marine resources, or  for  medical  waste
companies  to  dump  dangerous  medical  waste  in  open  fields  near  poor
residential areas to which our children are exposed.

Ndithetha  kabuhlungu,  engekho  omnye  ugxa  wethu  owuthandayo   lo   mba;
ii``poachers'  nee``marine  resources''.  Akathandanga  kuza  kuxoxa   apha.
Unikele umntakwabo utata uRaju, esingamaziyo ukuba uza  kuthetha  athini  na
ke yena kuba akalilo nelungu lale komiti.  Mhlawumbi,  oyena  mntu  ulilungu
usaye kuloba iintlanzi. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[I am experiencing pain as I speak in the absence of one  of  my  colleagues
who is interested in the matters of poachers and marine  resources.  He  was
not willing to take part in the debate here. He asked a colleague, Mr  Raju,
and we don't know what he is going to say, because he is not even  a  member
of this committee. Maybe the actual members have gone fishing.]

This amending Bill will create legal certainty in  terms  of  administration
and enforcement of our environmental laws. It will strengthen  our  hand  to
prosecute  and   punish   perpetrators   of   environmental   crimes.   Most
importantly, it will enable our Government to promote,  implement  and  give
substance to our constitutional right to a safe environment.

Besisoloko simva koonomathotholo, simbona koomabonakude, uMphathiswa  eyenza
le nto, ebabamba abantu. Futhi, kokokuqala simbona encediswa  nangamapolisa,
abagcini bomthetho. Huntshu, Mphathiswa! Siyayixhasa  yomibini  le  miThetho
eYilwayo  ephambi  kwale  Ndlu.  Enkosi,  Mhlalingaphambili.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[We've all along heard over the radio and seen the Minister  on  television,
doing this, arresting people. Also, it is the first time we  have  seen  him
being assisted by the police, law enforcement agents. Well done! We  support
both these Bills before this House. Thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]]

Mr J P GELDERBLOM (Western Cape): Hon Chair, hon Minister, the Western  Cape
supports in principle the National Environmental Management  Amendment  Bill
as introduced in the National Assembly as a section 76  Bill  and  published
in the Government Gazette  of  3  June  2003,  as  it  makes  the  necessary
provision for strengthening the  inadequacies  in  the  current  legislation
with respect to  law  enforcement  instruments,  compliance  and  monitoring
mechanisms and criminal sanctions and remedies.

We welcome the attempts made in  the  Bill  to  rationalise  and  streamline
administration and enforcement provisions in NEMA and the proposed  sectoral
legislation. The  Western  Cape  Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and
Development Planning has, however, registered concern about  the  manner  in
which some of the proposed positions dealing  with  concurrent  competencies
are weighed.

Furthermore, we wish to place on record that, in so  far  as  the  financial
implications of implementing the Bill are concerned, the principle of  funds
for the function will be applied and that the responsible authority will  be
able to  recover  moneys  directly  from  fines  and  forfeited  items.  The
introduction of spot fines would have helped the provinces in  dealing  with
transgressions.

In general terms, the National Environmental Management:  Biodiversity  Bill
in its current form is acceptable to  the  Western  Cape.  Although  several
suggested amendments were not included, these issues are,  in  our  opinion,
not critical and probably not worth pursuing any further.

Problems around the issue of concurrency have been addressed  to  a  certain
extent. Once again, these are not worth pursuing. The  department  requested
that Chapter 2, which  deals  with  the  functions  and  powers  of  the  SA
National Biodiversity Institute, should be moved to the  last  part  of  the
Bill, but this information has been ignored.

Preparation by all organs of state of  control  plans  on  invasive  species
will place a burden on certain provincial components in charge of  land  and
road, etc.

South Africa just cannot afford the eradication of invasive species  in  the
foreseeable future. In our  opinion,  the  financial  implications  for  the
state  do  not  reflect  the  actual  cost  to  provinces   and   management
authorities of protected  areas.  The  administration  of  a  bioprospecting
trust fund  will  require  a  clear  definition  of  owners,  providers  and
beneficiaries.

The scientific authority to be established  by  the  Minister  in  terms  of
section 59 should acknowledge the expertise vested in provinces  and  result
in a reduction, rather than an increase in costs. Reference  in  section  96
to appropriate consultation remains of concern as it is vague.
Apart from the above issues, we can confirm that we are willing  to  support
the Bill as amended.

Voorsitter, ek het ook die foto van die Leier van die Opposisie op die  boot
gesien. Die harde tragedie is dat die dame wat so hard  geveg  het  vir  die
kiesers, glad nie op daardie boot is nie. As ons mooi kyk na  daardie  boot,
sal ons sien dit is baie na aan die rotse. Ek dink dit sal ook  beteken  dat
die DA op die rotse sal wees. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, I  have  also  seen  the  photograph  of  the  Leader  of  the
Opposition on the boat. The real tragedy is that  the  lady  who  fought  so
hard for the voters is not on that boat at all.  If  we  look  carefully  at
that boat, we will see that it is very close to  the  rocks.  I  think  this
this would also mean that the DA will  be  on  the  rocks.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]]

Mrs J N  VILAKAZI:  Chairperson,  Minister  and  colleagues,  today  we  are
dealing with Bills  concerned  with  environmental  management,  namely  the
National Environmental Management Amendment Bill, Bill 29 of 2003,  and  the
National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Bill, Bill 30B of 2003.

The success of the management rests  on  the  efforts  of  the  co-operative
governance structures nationally. There is a need  for  a  co-ordinated  and
integrated  approach  from  all  levels  of  government  in  the   planning,
monitoring and management of  all  natural  resources  to  ensure  effective
management. This calls for an increased public awareness and involvement  on
environmental management, which includes vegetation, all animal  species  of
life, grasslands and surroundings as a whole.

South Africa's unique  biological  diversity,  variety  of  genes,  species,
ecosystems and ecological processes occurring in the country  are  an  asset
of international, national and local value and significance. The rivers  and
wetlands, mountains  and  planes,  estuaries  and  oceans,  and  magnificent
coastline and landscape contain an exceptionally rich and  varied  array  of
life forms which are integral to the existence of all  South  Africans,  and
upon which the national economy is fundamentally dependent.

To prevent the depreciation of our valuable resources,  the  following  must
be taken into consideration: First, there should be monitoring of all  alien
plants that affect our vegetation. Chapter 5 of the  National  Environmental
Management: Biodiversity Bill provides  for  the  management  of  alien  and
invasive species through the control of their introduction  and  spread,  as
well as the control of eradication of those already established.

Chapter  2  of  the  same  Bill  replaces  the  current  National  Botanical
Institute and provides  criteria  for  selection  of  a  governing  body  to
monitor provisions on general administration.  South  Africa's  biodiversity
is largely a result of  the  mix  of  tropical  and  temperate  climate  and
inhabitants occurring in the country. Since South Africa ranks as the  third
most biologically diverse country in  the  world  and  is  of  major  global
importance for biodiversity conservation,  failure  to  take  cognisance  of
this and failure to take immediate action will undermine the  resource  base
upon which people  depend.  We  will  close  existing  and  future  economic
opportunities of  using  our  biodiversity.  We  will  also  jeopardise  the
ecological processes which are necessary to keep our country fit for life.

The Constitution  accords  national  and  provincial  government  concurrent
legislative  competence  in  terms  of  most  branches   of   relevance   to
biodiversity conservation.

Ukunakekelwa   kwesimo   sobuhle   bemvelo   kubaluleke   kakhulu    impela.
UmThethosivivinywa esixoxa ngawo  namhlanje  thina  besifundazwe  saKwaZulu-
Natali siwamukela ngezandla zombili.

Imvelo  ibanzi  kakhulu  futhi  umhlaba  muhle  ngemvelo.  Umhlabathi   yiwo

Utshani nezithelo akulondolozeke, kulethe umnotho wezwe.

Sidinga ukubambisana emikhakheni  yonke  ezweni  lonke  ukuze  sigcine  izwe

[Taking care of nature's beauty is very important indeed. We  from  KwaZulu-
Natal province embrace the Bill under discussion today.

Nature is very versatile and the major source  of  world  beauty.  The  soil
produces crops and other things  for  us.  The  grass  in  turn  provides  a
blanket for the soil. There are various types of animals, water, swamps  and
many more. All the things I have listed provide beauty which should  not  be
interfered with, which we need to preserve and nurture so  that  we  do  not
destroy the very world that we live in. The animals with  whom  we  co-exist
must not be killed indiscriminately. Grass and fruits must be  preserved  so
that they can bring wealth to the land.

We need to co-operate in different sectors throughout the  country  so  that
we can keep our country wealthy, with clean  water  running  all  over,  the
people breathing sweet air devoid of  stinking  smells  and  smoke  that  is
unhygienic, bad for us, the animals and the whole of nature.

The grass serves as the land's blanket and should not be  burnt  anyhow,  at
any time and by just anyone. This is a bad practice which damages grass  and
soil, and which leads to the unnecessary  death  of  various  animals  while
causing the soil to erode.  Through  this  Bill  the  Government  helps  the
country preserve  nature,  prevent  soil  exhaustion,  protect  animals  and
improve the view through plants and flowers that will bring  in  wealth  and
make us proud of our country.

There are also things that live in water. The water needs  to  be  preserved
and nurtured since it is the  home  for  animals  that  live  in  it,  which
animals we in turn live on. However, the law takes care  that  they  do  not
become extinct, for if we destroy them, what are we going to  eat  tomorrow?
How is the wealth going to be created? I can discuss a long list  of  issues
concerning this very important Bill. However, it is enough to state that  it
ensures that we keep our country in a presentable and commendable state.  It
is up to all of us in this country, all governments,  all  spheres  and  all
families to do so.

We need to be on the lookout for imported plants  that  are  not  compatible
with our indigenous plants. Through this Bill experts will be  appointed  to
ensure that this does not happen. Thank you.]

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, as mentioned by  the
hon Minister in his opening remarks, the National  Environmental  Management
Act of  1998  is  a  seminal  piece  of  legislation  to  the  environmental
management area. This Bill seeks to  amend  the  Act  with  respect  to  the
administration and enforcement of those Acts that provide  for  co-operative
environmental governance. It establishes principles for decision-making  and
clearly delineates the procedures for co-ordinating environmental  functions
by the different organs of state.

The Bill has been described by the hon Minister as being ``far-reaching  and
revolutionary,'' and if it is indeed intended to strengthen  the  sinews  of
our decade-old democracy in South Africa, the DA supports the Bill.

The DA also sees  much  merit  in  the  National  Environmental  Management:
Biodiversity Bill. The Bill has a number of objectives, which are,  firstly,
to provide for the  management  and  conservation  of  biological  diversity
within the Republic,  the  use  of  indigenous  biological  resources  in  a
sustainable  manner,  and  the  sharing  of  benefits   arising   from   the
commercialisation of traditional uses and knowledge, and genetic  resources;
secondly,  to  give  effect  to   international   agreements   relating   to
biodiversity and which are binding on the Republic; thirdly, to provide  for
co-operative governance in biodiversity  management  and  conservation,  and
fourthly, to provide for a National  Biodiversity  Institute  to  assist  in
achieving those objectives.

Provision is also made  for  the  protection  of  threatened  or  endangered
species. This  has  a  direct  bearing  on  the  commercial  utilisation  of
biodiversity and seeks to ensure  that  this  is  done  in  an  ecologically
sustainable way.

Alien and invasive  species  also  come  under  the  purview  of  the  Bill.
Provision is made for the eradication or  control  of  such  plants.  Fairly
stringent  measures  are  introduced  relating  to  the  duty  and  care  of
landowners in relation to invasive species.

A potentially controversial  provision,  however,  concerns  benefit-sharing
agreements. No person may engage in bioprospecting without a permit, and  no
permit holder may exploit any biological  resources  for  which  traditional
use or knowledge exists without entering into  a  benefit-sharing  agreement
with the person or community practising that traditional use  or  knowledge.
This means that, in terms of the Bill, benefit-sharing is confined  only  to
the holders of traditional knowledge. The  implications  are  that  numerous
research institutions, organs  of  state,  companies  and  communities  that
engage in bioprospecting are excluded. That could be problematic.

Be that as it may, the DA finds much merit in this and has no hesitation  in
supporting the Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

[Mr V V  Z  WINDVOЁL:  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism, and hon members, it is a great pleasure for  me  to  be
one of the participants in this debate. I represent my  province,  which  is
Mpumalanga.]

It's just disturbing that I am following on the footsteps of  Mr  Raju  who,
in the NCOP Newsletter , is defined as a political animal. However, I  think
if that definition is correct,  he  is  a  political  animal  in  the  wrong
political kraal - an unsustainable political kraal, which can be defined  as
a political ecosystem where he might find  himself  becoming  an  endangered
species. [Laughter.]

Our debate today should be  understood  within  the  context  of  challenges
South Africa - and, of course, the world - faces in terms  of  environmental
management. The greatest challenge is that of improving human life for  both
present and future generations without  depleting  the  natural  capital  or
resources. This can only be achieved through a healthy, natural  environment
which  supplies  raw  material,  absorbs  and  treats  waste  products   and
maintains water, soil and air quality.

It's of importance to understand that food  security,  water  provision  and
climatic  stability  depend  on  having  properly  functioning   ecosystems,
maintained levels of biodiversity, sustainable rates of resource  extraction
and minimal waste production.

Our country, through the Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism,
has risen to the occasion through the introduction of  enabling  legislation
to  respond  to  the  aforesaid  challenges.  The   National   Environmental
Management Act gives a legal  framework  to  put  into  action  the  state's
obligation in terms of managing the environment. The National  Environmental
Management Act, which can be defined as the umbrella  legislation,  is  thus
complemented by the introduction of sectoral pieces of legislation;  namely,
the National  Environmental  Management:  Biodiversity  Bill,  the  National
Environmental  Management:  Protected  Areas  Bill,  National  Environmental
Management:  Air  Quality  Management  Bill,  the   National   Environmental
Management: Coastal Zone Management  Bill  and  the  National  Environmental
Management: Waste Management Bill.

In Rio, during 1992, the UN General Assembly Conference on  Environment  and
Development adopted Agenda No  21.  Our  country  has  gone  to  significant
lengths to implement some of these programmes nationally,  provincially  and
even at local government level.

Ten  years  later,  in  Johannesburg,  the  World  Summit   on   Sustainable
Development was in agreement to end poverty  and  protect  the  environment.
One of the successes achieved by the WSSD, inter alia,  was  the  launch  of
more than 300 partnerships, including 32  programmes  for  biodiversity  and
ecosystem management. It was further agreed that biodiversity loss is to  be
reversed by the year 2010, and the collapsed fish stock is  to  be  restored
by the year 2015. These  two  pieces  of  legislation  should  be  read  and
understood within this context.

paragraph follows.)

[We can simply say that this amendment to the NEMA gives the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism teeth to straighten the  crooked  and  the
perverse who are destroying our nature reserves. There, obviously,  will  be
assurance of order and obedience to the law. There will also be  prosecution
of those who violate the environmental laws and the safety of  the  citizens
from nature,  in  accordance  with  section  24  of  the  Constitution.  The
environmental degradation shall be reduced. This will be successful as  soon
as the soldiers of nature, EMIs, the  Environmental  Management  Inspectors,
are put in place and are functional.]

Speaking of the EMIs, for the  benefit  of  Mr  Tolo,  EMIs  does  not  mean
economic  marketing  institutions:   it   means   Environmental   Management
Inspectors. [Laughter.]

As the hon Minister has said, South Africa enjoys the  third  highest  level
of biodiversity in the world. The country's rich natural  heritage  is  vast
and staggering. We have got an  extraordinarily  varied  plant,  animal  and
marine life.

Mpumalanga shares a significant percentage of  this  biodiversity.  We  have
our provincial nature conservation parks,  the  Lowveld  National  Botanical
Garden with a lot of fauna and flora, site life species around  the  Mananga
mountains, the Barberton daisies, and  wetlands  with  numerous  species  of
birds, which include the blue crane.

As Mpumalanga, we are proud to be part of turning  the  tide  towards  sound
environmental  management,  and  we  fully  support  these  two  pieces   of
legislation. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon national  Minister  Moosa,  hon  Western
Cape Minister Gelderblom and hon colleagues, the  two  Bills  being  debated
today, namely the National Environmental Management Amendment Bill  and  the
National  Environmental  Management:  Biodiversity  Bill,  are  so   closely
interlinked that they are being introduced in tandem, and  it  is  therefore
logical that they should be discussed in the same debate. I  will  refer  to
the former Bill as the NEMA Bill and the latter as the biodiversity Bill.

This complex legislation is worthy in its intent, and has the  potential  to
impact on and introduce complicated requirements for a very wide variety  of
interests. The Gauteng Portfolio  Committee  on  Agriculture,  Conservation,
Environment and Land Affairs considered it, as a matter of fact,  to  be  of
such wide interest that it held public hearings on these two Bills.

The  NEMA  Bill  deals  with  measures  for   the   enforcement   of   other
environmental Acts and other Bills yet to come. It seeks to provide for  the
delegation of powers by the Minister, the director-general and the MECs  for
environmental affairs; to  provide  for  the  designation  of  environmental
management inspectors by the Ministers or  the  MECs;  and  to  provide  for
matters of compliance and enforcement.

A concern raised by the Gauteng  Department  of  Agriculture,  Conservation,
Environment and Land Affairs in the early stages  of  the  drafting  of  the
Bill is around the violation of the directive  in  terms  of  the  Act.  The
violation does not constitute a criminal offence, and it  therefore  remains
a key issue which is not addressed by the Bill. A second concern  raised  by
the department was that the Bill was heavily  biased  towards  dealing  with
enforcement aspects, and that there was virtually nothing in it  that  would
facilitate establishing a proactive compliance regime  that  would  possibly
have the effect of minimising enforcement problems.

The implementation of the  Bill  has  significant  personnel  and  financial
implications.  It  is  envisaged  that  implementation   would   imply   the
establishment of new working hours and the building of capacity  and  skills
in relation to environmental enforcement. Gauteng  accepts  that  this  must
happen. However, there needs to  be  a  realistic  assessment  of  financial
implications, and  my  province  would  only  be  able  to  accept  the  new
functions allocated to it if these were funded through an  intergovernmental
transfer. Gauteng nevertheless supports the NEMA Bill.

The biodiversity  Bill  establishes  controls  on  the  management  and  the
utilisation of species. It provides for the management and  conservation  of
the biological diversity of South Africa; the long-term sustainable  use  of
our biological  resources;  the  fair  and  equitable  sharing  of  benefits
arising from the use and application of generic resources and material;  and
the establishment of the SA National Biodiversity Institute.

I agree with the hon Minister that there has been uncontrolled  exploitation
of South Africa's biological resources and heritage.  A  recent  controversy
over bioprospecting which involved the commercial use of the  hoodia  plant,
traditionally used by the Khomani San of the Kalahari to  stave  off  hunger
and thirst, highlights the need to protect wild species,  to  promote  their
sustainable use and to ensure that indigenous people benefit  from  the  use
of their assets and of their traditional knowledge.

South Africa is the third most biologically diverse  country  in  the  world
and, as such, is fully cognisant of its responsibilities  in  ensuring  that
its valuable natural resources are  protected  and  used  sustainably.  This
Bill is a mechanism designed to ensure the management  and  conservation  of
biological diversity in South Africa.

During the public hearings on the biodiversity Bill held in Gauteng it  was,
inter alia, mentioned that the Bill was silent on  the  composition  of  the
scientific authority, which has a key role to play in the management of  the
wildlife  trade.  It  is  Gauteng's  view  that   each   provincial   nature
conservation authority should be recognised as a  scientific  authority  and
that the composition of the national scientific authority should be  defined
in such a way that each province, which is identified  as  a  permit-issuing
authority specified in the Bill,  should  be  represented  in  the  national
scientific authority body.

This would facilitate coherence in the implementation of  their  legislation
and administrative  efficiency,  as  well  as  ensure  that  the  scientific
capacity based in the provinces, and which is used to  assist  in  decision-
making around permits, is integrated into the envisaged national system.
We in Gauteng are  also  of  the  opinion  that  key  elements  of  wildlife
management are not addressed in the Bill. There are  a  host  of  activities
related to the wildlife trade,  including  the  regulation  of  professional
hunting,  the  registering  of  exemption  farms  and  the   regulation   of
nonthreatened indigenous species which may not be covered.

The effect of this is that the issues dealt with  in  provincial  ordinances
will not be addressed in  the  national  legislation,  and  that  provincial
legislation will, therefore, remain necessary. The implication is  that  the
present fragmented regulatory framework in regard to  wildlife  may  remain,
and the key reason for the introduction of national legislation may  not  be
achieved.

Despite these and other issues  raised  at  the  public  hearings,  which  I
cannot elaborate on now owing to the limited speaking time at  my  disposal,
I have pleasure in carrying out the mandate  conferred  on  me  to  indicate
that Gauteng supports this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, Minister, we in the ACDP  welcome  these  Bills.
When the Minister began his speech, he said  that  this  legislation  should
also be seen in the context of social  and  economic  development  and  that
there should be a balance.

I agree with that, except, Minister, we  must  be  very  careful.  There  is
nothing wrong with you being biased in favour of conservation, which I  know
you are, because the developers are biased  in  favour  of  development  and
they pull no punches. Therefore, in order to attain the  balance,  you  have
to be biased in favour of conservation, otherwise there will be no  balance.
So, when you are, you have the support of the ACDP.

The interesting thing is, Minister, that environmentalists have always  been
right. If you look at the literature in the 1970s and 1980s coming from  the
environmental lobby, who were then regarded as being loony Greens, you  will
see that they were right. All of the things we are seeing now,  were  warned
about in the 1970s by the environmentalists. So  we  should  listen  to  the
environmentalists, and it is good that we have this legislation. We do  have
a great responsibility of biodiversity to protect.

To understand this Bill one needs to look at it in context. The NEMA Bill  -
the National Environmental Management Bill - is the  overarching  Bill,  and
then there are its various legs. All the legs  are  not  in  place  yet.  We
have, for example, the Biodiversity Bill that is before us  today;  the  Air
Pollution Control Bill, which is  coming;  the  Protected  Areas  Bill,  the
Coastal Management Bill. It may well be that the  Minister  will  add  other
legs later to meet some of the things which my hon  colleague  from  Gauteng
had to say to us today.

The Bill is wonderful in its scope. One knows that it is ambitious  in  what
it seeks to achieve. Whether we have  -  and  I  pose  the  question  -  the
administrative  reach  to  fulfil  many  of  these  objectives  is   another
question. However, we have to start somewhere, and there  is  nothing  wrong
with  being  ambitious,  particularly   with   being   ambitious   regarding
conservation.
The Bill, however, does allow us to conform to our  national  objectives  on
sustainable use in order for  us  to  meet  our  international  obligations,
national environmental obligations and agreements we have entered into.

I just have a few things I would like to say in the very short time  that  I
am given to speak in this House, Minister. After the elections we will  have
many more members and I'll have much more time. We have  a  huge  amount  of
knowledge on fauna and flora at provincial level.  However,  to  rationalise
it, we must not dissemble and duplicate that pool of knowledge, but  try  to
increase the pool of knowledge in  a  national  effort.  We  have  to  guard
against that in what we do in the future in terms of this legislation.

We  need  to  look,  Minister,  at  changing  the   Constitution   to   make
conservation a local authority concurrent or devolved  competency  also.  At
the local level, if you look at the schedules - which I'm sure  you  have  -
you'll notice that only air  pollution  is  something  that  lies  at  local
authority level.  The  reality  is  that  land  use  is  a  local  authority
competency. They decide how land is going to be  used,  or  largely  decide,
and they are on the ground.  For  them,  then,  not  to  have  a  concurrent
obligation or devolved competence, I think, is wrong.

Also, we need to have the legislative teeth to dissuade people from  abusing
the environment, but we also have to incentivise in that  we  also  have  to
provide carrots and not only sticks. Most of the carrots that  can  be  used
effectively in this field lie at local government level.  So,  I  leave  the
thought with you, Minister. I really think this is a  profound  matter  that
needs to be looked at. The local authorities have to become a  part  of  the
process. This is a comprehensive, all-encompassing issue -  this  protection
of our ecosystems - and the local authorities should be  involved  and  also
constitutionally involved.

Also, there appears to be no provision for spot fines.  You  know  that  the
legislative process in this country,  Minister,  is  very  laborious.  There
should  be  provision  for  spot  fines,  which  are  an  effective  way  of
dissuading people from abusing the environment. This is something you  might
... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr  A  E  VAN  NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  this  is  the  first  time  that  the
legislature of the Northern Cape has requested me to  address  this  Council
on this specific cluster. I thank them for it.

However you will also see on the speakers' list that the very  last  speaker
before the hon Minister is the  hon  Mohammed  Sulliman  from  the  Northern
Cape, and I am sure he is there just in case I say something wrong or  leave
something out! [Laughter.]

We have been treated in this House today with so much  technical  detail  on
these two noncontroversial, but very important Bills that  it  would  surely
be an overkill if I go into detail as well. Going  into  overkill  would  be
totally out of order, especially in this debate. [Interjections.]

Wanneer  ons  oor  NEMA-wysigings  praat,  is  dit  baie  duidelik  dat  die
voorsiening  en  implementering  van  wetstoepassing  die  leemtes  in   die
oorspronklike wet kan vul. Die meer  doeltreffende  administrasie  word  ook
hierdeur aangespreek en sal 'n groter verbetering teweegbring.  As  ons  van
wetstoepassing praat, sal dit goed wees as die agb Minister reageer  op  die
moontlikheid dat sekere oortreders,  soos  verkeersoortreders,  afkoopboetes
kan betaal sonder dat hulle deur die hele regsproses hoef te gaan.

Die agb Minister van die Wes-Kaap, mnr Gelderblom, en agb Durr het  ook  pas
na sogenaamde ``spot fines'' verwys. Die regsproses moet  egter  nog  steeds
daar wees vir diegene wat nie betaal nie en dit moet hard op hulle  neerkom.
Hierdie benadering  behoort  vinniger,  kostedoeltreffend  en  effektief  te
wees.

Ten opsigte van die wetgewing oor biodiversiteit is  dit  belangrik  vir  al
die provinsies om kennis te neem van die wysigings wat  aangebring  is  deur
die gekose komitee om LURe in te sluit by die  opstelling  van  'n  lys  oor
sekere spesies. Dit is belangrik dat die nasionale Minister nie in  isolasie
optree nie, maar in oorlegpleging met die LURe. Die teenoorgestelde  is  ook
waar. Daar moet dus konsultasie wees.

Provinsies mag in  sekere  omstandighede  soos  met  rampe  oor  die  nodige
vermoëns beskik waarvan daar nie noodwendig op nasionale vlak  kennis  gedra
word nie. As daar konsultasie is voordat nasionaal opgetree  word,  kan  die
bronne tot voordeel van die provinsie en die land aangewend word.

Dit sal verwelkom word as die agb Minister 'n aanduiding  kan  gee  oor  hoe
die  biodiversiteitsinstituut  in  verhouding  tot   die   provinsies   gaan
funksioneer. Waar gaan die instituut wees? En sal dit bloot onder  nasionale
beheer staan, of wat is die omstandighede? Met dié  paar  gedagtes  en  vrae
ondersteun    die    Noord-Kaap     die     NEMA-wysigingswet     en     die
biodiversiteitswetsontwerp. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When we talk about NEMA amendments, it is quite clear  that  the  provision
for law enforcement and the implementing thereof can fill  in  the  gaps  in
the original legislation. The more efficient  administration  will  also  be
addressed hereby and it will bring about  bigger  improvement.  If  we  talk
about law enforcement, it will be good if the hon Minister  would  react  on
the possibility that certain offenders,  like  traffic  offenders,  can  pay
spot fines, without it being necessary for them  to  go  through  the  whole
legal process.

The hon Minister of the Western Cape, Mr Gelderblom, and hon Durr also  just
referred to so-called ``spot  fines''.  The  legal  process  should  however
still be there for those  who  do  not  pay  and  it  must  deal  with  them
severely. This approach  ought  to  be  quicker,  more  cost  efficient  and
effective.

In regards to the legislation on biodiversity, it is important for  all  the
provinces to take note of the amendments which were effected by the  elected
committee to include MECs in the compiling of a list on certain species.  It
is important that the national Minister do not  act  in  isolation,  but  in
consultation with the  MECs.  The  reverse  is  also  true.  There  must  be
consultation.

Provinces  might  in  certain  circumstances,  like  disasters,   have   the
necessary capacity which is not necessarily known about on  national  level.
If  consultation  takes  place  before  action  is  taken  nationally,   the
resources can be utilised to the benefit of the province and the country.

It would be welcomed if the hon Minister can give an indication of  how  the
institute for biodiversity will  function  in  relation  to  the  provinces.
Where will the institute be situated? And will it simply be  under  national
control, or what are the circumstances? With these couple  of  thoughts  and
questions the Northern  Cape  supports  the  NEMA  Amendment  Bill  and  the
biodiversity Bill.]

Li lethu siyaxhasa. [Ons steun die wetsontwerp.] Applous.

Mr R M NYAKANE: Hon Chair,  the  two  pieces  of  legislation  under  debate
before this House signify the Government's response to the obligation it  is
charged with in terms of section 21 of  the  Bill  of  Rights.  This  is  an
obligation to ensure that everyone lives in  an  environment  which  is  not
harmful to his or her health or wellbeing.

Needless to mention,  a  clear  link  exists  between  the  quality  of  the
environment  and  the  health  profile  of  the  people  exposed  to   these
environments.  Cholera  epidemics  which  occurred  in  some  parts  of  our
provinces testify to this phenomenon.

Protection of the environment benefits not  only  the  present  generations,
but future generations as well. Hence, the emphasis is laid on  the  concept
``intergenerational equity''. Harm to the environment  results  in  harm  to
the present and future generations.

Countries grossly polluted with landmines are characterised  by  a  sizeable
number of maimed persons, hence Scarlett Harding's  expression  about  ``the
tragedy of the commons''.

The past has taught us that legislative measures  alone  are  inadequate  to
ensure full compliance with the requirements of the law by its citizenry.  I
raise this matter in relation to section 31(g) and  31(h)  of  the  National
Environmental Management Amendment Bill wherein powers and functions of  the
environmental management inspectors have  been  clearly  articulated.  Given
this background, it therefore becomes imperative to focus  on  our  measures
which will ensure sustainable compliance with these laws. These  are  simply
the change of human behaviour towards their  environment.  Training  modules
for  the  environmental  management  inspectors  have  to   therefore   take
cognisance of this element.

Human behaviour is  usually  manifested  by  one's  lifestyle,  beliefs  and
practices which are, in most cases, responsible for the pollution of his  or
her immediate environment. Indiscriminate  faecal  disposal,  veld  burning,
littering, uncontrolled refuse disposal are practices that are motivated  by
human conduct. It is for this reason that training modules  should  strongly
stress a change in one's behaviour.

The media has recently  revealed  the  outcome  of  a  survey  conducted  at
Pietermaritzburg  and  Kwalezana   Hospital,   relating   to   environmental
pollution. The survey revealed that the incineration method  -  though  this
test case might not be relevant at this juncture - as a  means  of  disposal
has proved to be inadequate. Children were found in possession of  syringes,
bottles and plastic medicine containers which had survived  the  process  of
incineration. Disposal of substances such as microwaves posed another  great
concern.

I share this observation with this House in an attempt to depict the  extent
of the environmental pollution problem in our country.  Most  localities  in
the Limpopo province ... [Time expired.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Deputy Chair, I  rise  in  support
of these two Bills before us here today. Having listened to the debate,  I'm
think I'm not going to bore you with the details of the Bills, but just  say
that we in the ANC support the two Bills.

I want to join the hon Mr Van Niekerk just to assure him that  my  name  was
not put there to play policeman, but  in  order  to  support  him.  We  have
confidence in him.  All  of  us  in  this  House  represent  our  provinces.
Whatever party  you  are  from,  you  can  participate  on  behalf  of  your
province. [Interjections.]

Chairperson, I think I also need to mention  the  serious  allegation  which
was made by Mr Van den Berg in connection with  the  hon  member  Antoinette
Versfeld. It's a pity she is not in this august House here today.  What  she
did ...

Ms C BOTHA: On a point of order, Sir ...

Mr M A SULLIMAN: What she did was she took Mr Van den Berg's ...

Ms C BOTHA: On a point of order: Is it acceptable for assertions to be  made
and aspersions to be cast upon a person's character ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, excuse  me.  Mr  Sulliman,
could you take your seat please? Sorry, hon member. Actually, the  procedure
is that I should recognise you first.

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please go on.

Ms C BOTHA: Thank you very much. Is it  acceptable  for  a  member  to  cast
aspersions on the character of a member who  is  not  present,  without  any
proof - purely allegations that are being  made  while  the  member  is  not
present? [Interjections.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  That's  not  a  point  of  order,
actually. [Interjections.] Sorry, Mr Sulliman, could  you  take  your  seat,
please?

Mr L G LEVER: Deputy Chairperson, on a point of order: The statements  which
the learned Sulliman refers to have no relevance to the debate at hand  and,
on  the  rule  of  relevance,   are   not   admissible   in   this   debate.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Are you through?

Mr L G LEVER: Yes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. Again, that's not  a  point
of order. Mr Sulliman, would you please continue?

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, then I must say, at this stage, that I must  lead
my delegation out of  the  House,  which  will  no  longer  have  a  quorum.
[Interjections.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  [Interjections.]   Please
continue. [Interjections.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, it's  typical  of  the  DA  to  play  boycott
politics,  and  that  is  not  going  to   serve   our   country   at   all.
[Interjections.] It just shows you that they are  not  interested  in  South
Africa. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: The DA is against progress. [Interjections.]

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:   Hon   member!   Order,   please!
[Interjections.] Just hold on, Mr Sulliman.

Thank you. According to the list here, it was Mr  Gelderblom,  the  MEC  for
environmental affairs and development planning.  So,  Mr  Sulliman,  if  you
could continue.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Deputy Chair, if  you've  noticed,
the DA members have left the House. They are playing boycott politics  here,
and that is not good for South Africa. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Order,  hon  members!  Can  we
give Mr Sulliman a chance, please?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Thank you, Deputy  Chair.  Deputy  Chair,  the  hon  member
member Versfeld also took the R6 000 from Mr Van den  Bergh  and  she  never
submitted that particular application, which means that poor fisherman  from
Struisbaai stands a chance of losing his money. However, I  want  to  appeal
to the Minister today to investigate this matter. We must make sure, and  we
must also check on the conduct of the hon member Versfeld. It  seems  to  me
she is busy misleading people out there in order to get votes.

My appeal to the hon Minister is to consider Mr  Van  den  Berg's  situation
and see if there is any way in which he can perhaps be assisted. I am  doing
this because it is clear that people are  being  manipulated  somewhere  out
there. False promises are being made, and once  we  raise  these  issues  in
this House, they stand  up  and  disappear  from  this  august  House.  They
undermine this House. We as members of NCOP do have the right  to  speak  in
this House, and that is our constitutional right.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: They have respect for ... [Inaudible.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: They respect nothing, I do agree, hon member  Van  Niekerk.
However, I want to conclude by saying that we in the ANC support  these  two
Bills, hon Minister. We are awaiting the rest of  the  Bills,  and  you  can
rest assured that we will scrutinise them and do a thorough job on  them.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. What is your question,  hon
member?

Mr K D S DURR: I would like to know what the Minister's thoughts  are  about
local authorities' competency regarding conservation.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  I  wonder  whether  the  Minister  is
prepared to answer that question.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  I  should
have commented on that,  because  Mr  Durr  did  raise  it  in  his  earlier
comments during the debate. I  don't  think  that  it  is  necessary  for  a
constitutional amendment, because it is a concurrent competency  as  far  as
conservation is concerned. I think that we would  further  disaggregate  the
legislative  framework  and  responsibilities  as  far  as  conservation  is
concerned.

At present, national and provincial governments  share  that  responsibility
and commonage as far as conservation in this country is  concerned.  As  you
will see from this Bill, and even this debate, it is not necessarily a  very
easy thing to do. In many countries you would find that  when  it  comes  to
threatened  species  or  international  trade,  or  any  kind  of  trade  in
endangered species, there would simply be a national regime on this matter.
What I do agree with, though, is that local governments have a role to  play
in conservation, and local governments must have obligations  in  regard  to
conservation, so that when local government planning takes place, it  should
take  into  account  the   question   of   the   environment,   particularly
conservation.  This  can  be  done  through  both  national  and  provincial
legislation, to ensure that local governments adhere  to  certain  norms  as
far as conservation is concerned. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank  you.  Hon  members,  before  we
conclude this debate, I would like to refer to the incident that  has  taken
place in this House. The ruling from the Chair is  that  we  would  have  to
check the Hansard records and see whether what Mr Sulliman  said  is  valid,
and make a ruling thereon. Thanks.

Hon members, that concludes the debate. I shall  now  put  the  question  in
respect of the first order. The question is that the Bill be agreed  to.  As
this decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of  the  Constitution,  I
shall first ascertain whether  all  delegation  heads  are  present  in  the
Chamber to cast their provinces' votes. I think they are all here.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote if they so wish. There is none.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in favour or against, or  whether  they  abstain
from voting. Eastern Cape?

Mr K D S DURR: Die Wes-Kaap steun. [Western Cape supports.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. All  nine  provinces  voted
in favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed to. [Applause].

Order! I shall now put the question in respect  of  the  second  order.  The
question is that the Bill be agreed to. As this decision is  dealt  with  in
terms of section 65 of the Constitution, I  shall  first  ascertain  whether
all delegation heads are present in the Chamber  to  cast  their  provinces'
votes. They are all here.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow  provinces  the  opportunity
to make their declarations of vote if they so wish. There is none.

therefore declare the Bill agreed to. [Applause].

    CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON LAND AND ENVIRONMENTAL
    AFFAIRS PROTOCOL ON WILDLIFE CONSERVATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE
                   SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon Chair, it is good that we  have  just  passed  these  two
pieces of legislation that overlap each other.  This  protocol  also  serves
the same  statement  on  the  Protocol  on  Wildlife  Conservation  and  Law
Enforcement.

The protocol before us today signifies, in  a  very  profound  manner,  that
Africans have long been  utilising  natural  assets,  not  only  to  develop
socially and economically, but also to contribute to a deeper  understanding
of conservation and the sustenance of it. The objectives of the Protocol  on
Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement affirm  the  sovereign  rights  of
members states of SADC to  manage  their  wildlife  resources  collectively.
Furthermore, it recognises the conservation and sustainable economic use  of
wildlife and biodiversity in the region.

However, most importantly, it recognises that the survival of  wildlife  and
that of the population of the region depend  on  each  other  for  survival.
Therefore, it has become imperative  for  member  states  to  co-operate  in
enforcing laws governing wildlife since all member  states  are  members  of
Interpol and signatories of various international  and  African  conventions
relating to wildlife and biodiversity.

LELOKO LE LE TLOTLEGANG: Bua!

Moruti P MOATSHE: Ke  a  bua,  ke  a  bua!  [Tsenoganong.]  (Translation  of
Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[Rev  P  MOATSHE:  We  have  already  seen  the  efforts  made  during   the
construction  of  the  transfrontier  park  of   Kgalagadi,   or   Kgalagadi
Transfrontier Park. The construction of  the  Kgalagadi  Transfrontier  Park
has intensified the co-operation we are talking about  today.  This  feeling
is in line with the co-operation that we are establishing.  It  reveals  the
responsibility of  neighbouring  countries  to  take  joint  responsibility.
People should help each other.

This co-operation challenges the  people  and  communities  to  protect  all
living creatures, and to groups of people to make an effort to  protect  all
living creatures.  When  this  has  been  achieved,  people  will  see  good
results.

This  co-operation  binds  the  neighbouring  countries  to  strengthen  and
implement this law when it is broken. This includes  the  efforts  taken  to
protect living creatures, illegal trade in animals, to give powers  to  game
rangers and to neighbouring countries, to  respect  the  agreements  entered
into, and to respect each other as neighbouring countries.

An HON MEMBER: Speak!

Rev P MOATSHE: I am speaking, I am speaking! ... [Interjections.]]

What is also significant in  the  protocol  is  that  it  ensures  that  the
general population in the region  is  educated  and  that  public  awareness
concerning issues  of  sustainable  use  of  wildlife  and  conservation  is
ensured. It encourages research and the building of capacity to ensure  that
our youth are conscientised and kept informed about their heritage. In  this
regard, the establishment of a regional database is also envisaged and  will
report on the status and management of wildlife.

With regard to the provision of resources - financial, human  and  otherwise
- it will be incumbent on state parties to  honour  their  commitments  with
respect to the effective implementation of this protocol.

Lastly and in conclusion, South Africa's ratification  of  the  Protocol  on
Wildlife Conservation and Law Enforcement confirms  its  commitment  to  the
conservation and sustainable utilisation of  wildlife  and  biodiversity  in
the region.

Chairperson, we support this protocol. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the question that  the
Report be agreed to. As the decision is dealt with in terms  of  Section  65
of the Constitution, I shall first ascertain whether  all  delegation  heads
are present in the Chamber to cast their votes.

In accordance with Rule 71, I shall first give provinces the opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote, if they so wish. Since there are  none,  we
