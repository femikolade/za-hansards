Mrs S V KALYAN: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House-


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the  growing  frustration  amongst  doctors  over  the  chronic
           underfunding of hospitals;


       (b)  the deteriorating pay and working conditions; and

           Amendment Act on patients' access to  prescription drugs;


  (3) therefore resolves to discuss -


       (a)  the deteriorating quality  of  health  care  being  provided  to
           patients who are dependent on the state health care system;


       (b)  the consequent impact of that  on  the  morale  of  doctors  and
           nurses; and


       (c)  the state's ability to  retain  the  services  of  health   care
           professionals.

  SUBJECT OF FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION OF PARLIAMENT TO BE CONSIDERED WITH A
                          VIEW TO INTRODUCING BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr L J MODISENYANE:  Chairperson,  on  behalf  of  the  Chief  Whip  of  the
Majority Party, I move the draft resolution  printed  in  his  name  on  the
Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House instructs the Portfolio Committee on Finance to -


  (1) consider the subject of the financial  administration  of  Parliament
       with a view to  introducing  a  bill  dealing  with  the  matter,  in
       accordance with the Assembly Rules;


  (2) report to the House by no later than the end of November 2003; and


  (3) subject to the concurrence of  the  National  Council  of  Provinces,
       confer with the Select Committee on Finance of the  National  Council
       of Provinces.

Agreed to.

                        CALL FOR CARE OF THE ELDERLY

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M P MENTOR (ANC): Chair, the 22nd to the 28th September  2003  marks  Old
Persons' Awareness Week. During this focus week in aid of the  elderly,  the
ANC  reaffirms  its  commitment  to  improving  the  social   and   economic
conditions of the elderly in our society by improving their  social  grants,
access to health care facilities and protection.

We remain acutely aware of the many challenges that elderly people  continue
to face, including neglect and abuse by  even  those  who  are  supposed  to
assist them, such as corrupt officials and microlenders.

The ANC calls on all the people of  our  country  to  commit  themselves  to
working towards the creation  of  a  caring  environment  for  the  elderly.
[Applause.]

               UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES ACCORDING TO STATISTICS SA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C M LOWE (DA): Mr Chairman, the latest unemployment figures  released  by
Statistics SA this morning are cold comfort for South Africa's jobless,  and
confirm the devastating unemployment situation after 10 years of  ANC  rule.
Once again, the figures underline South Africa's mounting jobs  crisis,  and
show the unwillingness and inability of Government to grasp job creation  as
our most urgent national priority. As at March 2003, nearly 8 million  South
Africans - 42,1% - were unemployed, which is up from 41,8%  six  months  ago
and 2% more than a year ago when the figure stood at 40,9%.

South Africa is not working. More than a million jobs have been  lost  since
1994. Nearly 8 million South Africans are either out of work, looking for  a
job  or  have  given  up  hope  of  ever  finding  one.  June's  Growth  and
Development Summit remains a summit of  good  intentions  with  very  little
else to show for it. To face down the jobs  crisis,  the  ANC  must  nurture
small business, which is the only generator of new jobs.

The DA has repeatedly called for amendments to current  labour  legislation,
that will  encourage  job  creation,  rather  than  kowtowing  to  organised
labour. The DA has called for better access to finance for small  businesses
and for a black economic empowerment policy that is  equitable,  transparent
and measurable and not open to abuse, and, of  course,  for  the  widespread
skills training we so desperately need.

Until Government gets serious about everything that  it  does  and  measures
that against the impact on job creation, we will never  make  a  significant
dent in unemployment, and the unemployment  queues  will  only  get  longer.
[Applause.]

                         TRIBUTE TO CLEMENTS KADALIE

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Hon Chairperson, as it  is  still  Heritage  Month  I
rise to pay tribute to the late Clements Kadalie. During  the  time  of  the
repressive labour laws in mines and industry, he became the  sole  voice  of
workers and formed the Industrial and Commercial Workers'  Union  of  SA  in
1919 here in Cape Town.

In later years the ICU developed into  a  massive  workers'  movement  which
attracted over 100 000 members spread over  present-day  Gauteng,  the  Free
State and KwaZulu-Natal. Clements Kadalie became the  general  secretary  of
the federation, working tirelessly  to  organise  and  educate  his  members
about their rights on  the  docks,  the  mines  and  the  railways,  and  in
commerce and municipal services.

Kadalie consistently sought to win  international  recognition  and  support
for his union  by  frequent  overseas  missions,  but  the  regime  was  too
oppressive to allow this to happen. By 1929 the ICU showed signs of  decline
because of infiltration by the then state agents  and  because  of  internal
conflicts among its own members. Despite the virtual collapse  of  the  ICU,
Clements Kadalie remained the workers'  icon  and  will  be  remembered  for
having given many workers a brief taste of freedom in the  workplace.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

    PROGRAMME TO MAINTAIN GOVERNMENT FACILITIES AND FIGHT POVERTY IN THE
                                WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S C VAN DER MERWE (ANC): Chairperson, the  department  of  transport  and
public works  in  the  Western  Cape  is  establishing  a  programme  called
``Saamstaan'' aimed at maintaining government facilities while  contributing
to the fight against poverty.

The programme is in line with the resolution emanating from the  Growth  and
Development Summit  relating  to  the  roll-out  of  extended  Public  Works
programmes. Participants in  the  programme  receive  training  designed  to
equip them with skills which  they  can  use  even  when  the  programme  is
complete.

The ANC commends the Western Cape provincial  government  on  its  continued
commitment  to  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  I  thank   you.
[Applause.]

                      NEW NP-ANC CO-OPERATION AGREEMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP): Chairperson, the leader of the  New  NP  in  the
Northern Cape was sworn in as a member of this House last  Friday,  and,  in
terms of the co-operation agreement between the ANC and the New NP,  he  was
also sworn in as Deputy Minister of Correctional Services.

Allow me to point out once again that this  co-operation  agreement  between
the ANC and the New NP is not so much about posts and positions  as  the  DA
wants the electorate to believe. [Interjections.]  It  is  much  more  about
demonstrating that political reconciliation is possible in this country.  It
is about showing that former political adversaries can work together in  the
best interests of this country. [Applause.]

I am convinced that the hon Minister and the hon Deputy Minister will  be  a
formidable team.

Dis ook die eerste keer sedert 1994 dat 'n enkele staatsdepartement  bestuur
word  deur  'n  Minister  en  'n  Adjunkminister  wat  nie  lede   van   die
regeringsparty is nie. En dít demonstreer dat veelpartydemokrasie  in  Suid-
Afrika werk, en dat Suid-Afrika nie op pad is om 'n  eenpartystaat  te  word
soos die opposisie beweer nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.] (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[It is also the first time since 1994 that  a  single  state  department  is
managed by both a Minister and a Deputy Minister who are not members of  the
ruling party. And this demonstrates that multiparty democracy is working  in
South Africa, and that South Africa is not on its way  to  becoming  a  one-
party state as alleged by the opposition. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon members, may I  have
some order in the House please? The UDM? Order! Does  the  UDM  not  have  a
statement? No. Then we proceed to the ANC.

                    TRAINING INITIATIVE FOR TAXI INDUSTRY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G D SCHNEEMAN (ANC): Chairperson, the Transport  Education  and  Training
Authority is to give taxi drivers,  owners  and  rank  administrative  staff
training  on  road  safety,  the  Road  Traffic  Act,  and  parts   of   the
Constitution.

This  initiative  is  funded  through  the  National  Skills  Fund  of   the
Department of Labour and provincial transport departments. This  is  a  fine
example of the ANC-led Government's commitment to saving and  improving  the
lives of our people.

Such a project will assist in lowering the casualty rates on our roads,  and
has a positive contribution towards the  overall  improvement  of  the  taxi
industry. This is yet again another  proud  effort  by  our  Government  and
people to change our lives for the better. I thank you. [Applause.]

                             COMBATING OF CRIME

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr R P ZONDO (ANC): Chairperson, last  Friday  the  editorial  of  The  Star
newspaper commended the SA Police Service on  progress  being  made  in  the
fight against cash-in-transit robberies. In a related development,  Business
Against  Crime  chairperson  James  Fitzgerald  said  last  week  that   the
country's crime statistics were completely up to date and that  the  picture
created by the statistics was a positive one.

The clear message  is  that  the  tide  against  crime  has  turned.  It  is
heartening  that  the  Police   Service   is   registering   successes   and
particularly against cash-in-transit heists, as this heinous  crime  results
in loss of life of even ordinary people who often find themselves caught  in
the crossfire. Heists also contribute  much  to  tarnishing  South  Africa's
image both locally and internationally.

The ANC adds its voice in commending the SA Police Service on  its  untiring
effort to protect and secure all the inhabitants of our country. Thank  you.
[Applause.]

                           CONDITION OF DIRT ROADS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A H NEL (DA):  Mnr  die  Voorsitter,  die  skokkende  toestand  van  die
grondpaaie in die Noord-Kaap en veral in die  Namakwa-distriksmunisipaliteit
raak    nou    onuithoudbaar.    Die    begroting    van    die     Namakwa-
distriksmunisipaliteit is tussen sewe en agt miljoen rand. Hiervan word  70%
gebruik vir salarisse en  lone  -  duidelik  'n  teken  van  die  gebrekkige
bestuursvermoë van dié ANC-beheerde raad.

Die  afdanking  en  ignorering  van  kundige   amptenare   met   kennis   en
ondervinding het bygedra tot dié  toestand.  Selfs  die  goeie  insette  van
ander raadslede word eenvoudig net verwerp, bloot omdat dit  deur  politieke
opponente voorgestel is. Die  verval  van  paaie  het  tot  gevolg  dat  die
ekonomie van die hele streek daaronder ly. Die koste  van  die  vervoer  van
landbouprodukte op hierdie paaie het die hoogte ingeskiet, en toerisme  word
negatief geraak.

Padongelukke en sterftes neem toe. In  'n  ondersoek  deur  die  Namakwaland
Boere-unie is gevind dat  daar  oor  die  laaste  twee  jaar  456  ongelukke
plaasgevind het, waarin 179 mense beseer is, en  waarin  daar  26  ongevalle
was. Dié  toestand  is  onaanvaarbaar  en  daar  word  geen  ag  geslaan  op
herhaalde versoeke en voorstelle nie. Die enigste blywende oplossing  is  om
ons stemkrag te gebruik om ontslae te raak van dié raad, waarin  die  meeste
lede net in hulle eie en hul vriende  se  belange  geïnteresseerd  is.  Baie
dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr A H NEL (DA): Mr Chairman, the shocking condition of the dirt  roads  in
the Northern Cape and especially in the  Namaqua  district  municipality  is
becoming unbearable. The budget of  the  Namaqua  district  municipality  is
between seven and eight million rands. Seventy per cent  of  this  is  being
used for salaries and wages - clearly a sign of the poor management  ability
of this ANC-controlled council.

Dismissing and ignoring competent officials with  knowledge  and  experience
has contributed to this condition. Even the good  inputs  of  other  council
members are simply being rejected, just because they have not been  proposed
by political opponents. The deterioration of  the  roads  has  affected  the
economy of  the  entire  region.  The  cost  of  transport  of  agricultural
products  on  these  roads  has   escalated,   and   tourism   is   affected
detrimentally.

Road accidents and  deaths  are  increasing.  In  an  investigation  by  the
Namaqualand Farmers' Union it was found that 456 accidents had  taken  place
in the  last  two  years,  with  179  people  being  injured,  and  with  26
casualties. This state of affairs is  unacceptable,  and  repeated  requests
and proposals are being ignored. The only lasting solution is for us to  use
our voting power in order to get rid of the council, most members  of  which
are interested only in their own interests and in those  of  their  friends.
Thank you very much.]

                         BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M MDLALOSE (IFP): Deputy Speaker,  in  November  2000,  an  empowerment
charter for the liquid fuels industry was  agreed  to  by  the  role-players
from industry and Government. Among others, the charter provided  for  black
economic empowerment through equity ownership and  management  participation
for historically disadvantaged South Africans in the liquid fuel sector.
The implementation of the charter has gone well in certain instances but  in
others a lot of work remains to be done. One  of  the  cornerstones  of  the
charter is that BEE companies should receive preference  when  it  comes  to
the awarding of service and supply tenders in the industry.

By all accounts, much progress has been made by  all  companies  in  meeting
this commitment. Yet, this does not seem to be the case where state  tenders
are concerned. Just recently, industry players  complained  that  Government
departments were not awarding state contracts to BEE  companies.  This  goes
against the objectives of the empowerment charter.

Government is a signatory to the charter and it has  just  recently  piloted
broad-based BEE legislation through  this  House.  Preferential  procurement
legislation was adopted in 1998. It is, therefore,  disconcerting  that  the
state itself is not adhering to preferential  procurement  policies  in  the
liquid fuels industry.

This might be indicative of a fragmented approach to BEE  within  Government
departments, and we sincerely hope that the relevant Ministers will  rectify
this situation as soon as possible. Only then  will  truly  broad-based  BEE
become a reality. Thank you.

              ALLEGED RAPE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA HOSTEL

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S D MONTSISI (ANC): Chairperson, as a society, South  Africans  view  the
alleged rape incident at  the  University  of  Pretoria  hostel  in  a  very
serious light. Despite considerable progress made by this country  in  terms
of addressing the  centuries-old  patriarchal  attitudes,  exploitation  and
abuse of women, the violation of women's rights continue  to  undermine  our
quest to create a humane society.

Such incidents which occur mainly  amongst  young  people,  indeed,  inflict
great harm  on  the  victim  at  both  physical  and  psychological  levels.
Furthermore, our moral standing as a  people  is  demeaned  by  these  cruel
acts. Shocked as we all are, this calls for intensification of the  struggle
on all fronts against the abuse of women and children.

We should continue to sharpen our criminal justice system to  better  handle
all aspects of such cases, and strengthen our  moral  regeneration  campaign
and work to ensure that our young people are made aware, even at an  earlier
age, of our society's commitment to human rights and human dignity. I  thank
you. [Applause.]

                           LATEST CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr  J  SCHIPPERS  (Nuwe  NP):  Voorsitter,  ten  spyte  van   die   jongste
misdaadsyfers wat daarop dui dat  geweldsmisdaad  afneem,  is  die  Nuwe  NP
steeds bekommerd oor die  voorkoms  van  geweldsmisdade  in  ons  land.  Die
brutale aard van die geweld  het  'n  kenmerk  van  misdaad  in  Suid-Afrika
geword en moet dringend aangespreek word. Die Nuwe NP doen 'n beroep op  die
Minister om onmiddellik 'n wetenskaplike ondersoek in te stel na  die  redes
vir die brutale geweld by die pleeg van misdade.

Waarom maak motorkapers motoriste dood, selfs al verset hulle hul  nie  teen
die kapings nie? Waarom word vroue op  'n  gewelddadige  wyse  aangerand  en
verkrag as die motivering slegs  diefstal  is?  Waarom  word  boere  en  hul
vrouens met warm  strykysters  gebrand  en  wreedaardig  aangerand  alvorens
hulle goedere gesteel word?

Ondanks 'n afname in sommige misdade voel die publiek nie  veilig  nie.  Die
Nuwe NP doen daarom 'n beroep op die Minister om die statistiek van  misdaad
op plaaslike polisiekantoorvlak aan die plaaslike  polisieforums  beskikbaar
te stel. Nasionale statistiek gee nie die volle prentjie nie, omdat 50%  van
alle misdade in net 21 polisiegebiede plaasvind. Die publiek  wil  weet  hoe
veilig of onveilig hulle in die omgewing is waar hulle 'n huis gaan koop  of
hulle kinders skool toe gaan stuur.

Hierdie statistieke moet kwartaalliks bekend gemaak  word.  As  die  publiek
meer gereeld statistiek kry, kan hulle  hul  plaaslike  polisiehoof  daaraan
meet, en betyds ingryp  as  misdaad  styg.  Baie  dankie.  [Tyd  verstreke.]
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr J SCHIPPERS (New NP): Chairperson, despite the latest  crime  statistics
which indicate that violent  crime  is  decreasing,  the  New  NP  is  still
worried about the prevalence of violent crimes in our  country.  The  brutal
nature of the violence has become a characteristic of crime in South  Africa
and needs to be addressed urgently. The New NP  calls  on  the  Minister  to
start immediately with a scientific investigation into the reasons for  this
brutal violence during crime.

Why do hijackers kill motorists, even if they do not resist  the  hijacking?
Why are women brutally attacked and raped if the reason  for  the  crime  is
mere robbery? Why are farmers and their  wives  burnt  with  hot  irons  and
brutally assaulted, before their possessions are stolen?
Despite a decrease in some crimes members of the public do  not  feel  safe.
The New NP therefore calls on the Minister to make the crime  statistics  at
local police station level available to the local  police  forums.  National
statistics do not give us the whole picture, since 50% of all  crimes  occur
in only 21 police areas. The public want to know how  safe  or  unsafe  they
will be in a particular area where they are going to buy  a  house  or  send
their children to school.

These statistics need to be made available on  a  quarterly  basis.  If  the
public receive statistics more regularly, they can measure the local  police
chief's performance against them, and act timeously should  crime  increase.
Thank you very much. [Time expired.]]

           DISRUPTION OF CLASSES AT SOME SCHOOLS IN KWAZULU-NATAL

                            (Member's Statement)

Nksz J E SOSIBO (ANC): Sihlalo, ngesonto eledlule sethule isitatimende  kule
Ndlu mayelana nesimo sokuphazamiseka kwezifundo kwezinye  zezikole  KwaZulu-
Natali. Ephendula leyo nkulumo, kuyo le Ndlu, uNgqongqoshe wezeMfundo  uthe,
``Kukho konke  esikwenzayo,  kufanele  sibeke  phambili  ikusasa  labantwana
bethu.''

Kuyasithokozisa-ke   ukuthi   emva   kwemizamo   ephuthumayo   kaNgqongqoshe
wezeMfundo,  uKader  Asmal,  iNelson  Mandela  Foundation  seyelule  isandla
sosizo lokubiyela lezi zikole, kanti kubikwa nokuthi umphakathi  namaphoyisa
sebelusukumele lolu daba.

I-ANC ikushayela  ihlombe  lokhu  kubambisana  okukhona  phakathi  komNyango
wezeMfundo,  iNelson  Mandela  Foundation,  amaphoyisa   kanye   nomphakathi
waseLadysmith.  Ngiyabonga.  [Ihlombe.]  (Translation   of   Zulu   member's
statement follows.)

[Miss J E SOSIBO (ANC): Chairperson, last week we made a statement  in  this
House with regard to the disruption of education in some of the  schools  in
KwaZulu-Natal. Responding to that statement in this House, the  Minister  of
Education said: ``In everything we do, we must  put  our  children's  future
first.''

We are very  happy  that  after  the  speedy  efforts  of  the  Minister  of
Education, Kader Asmal, the Nelson Mandela Foundation has  lent  a  hand  to
fence these schools. There are also  reports  that  the  community  and  the
police are addressing this issue.

The ANC applauds this co-operation between the Department of Education,  the
Nelson Mandela Foundation, the police and the community of Ladysmith.  Thank
you. [Applause.]]

                           SITUATION IN THE SUDAN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr G B D McINTOSH (DA): Mr Chairman,  we  believe  that  this  House  should
recognise the situation that prevails in the Sudan, and  in  southern  Sudan
in particular, where there is a 20-year  war  which  started  in  1983.  The
potential for the issues in the Sudan to  create  international  instability
around issues such as Sharia law, allegations of ongoing slavery,  the  1929
Nile Agreement, racism against  the  people  of  the  south,  all  have  the
potential to inflict serious damage on the African Union, on Nepad, as  well
as on international relations.

Three members of Parliament from  this  House  visited  southern  Sudan  and
Kenya last week. They were able  to  see  that  real  progress  is  made  in
recognising the legitimate demands and  quest  of  the  people  of  southern
Sudan, and that the people of northern Sudan are coming to some sort  of  an
agreement in terms of the Machacos Protocol. We  also  particularly  commend
the involvement  of  other  international  countries,  such  as  the  United
States, Norway, Italy, Canada  and  the  United  Kingdom,  as  well  as  the
important role  that  a  South  African,  Mr  Fink  Haysom,  is  playing  in
facilitating the talks at Naivasha in Kenya. [Applause.]

                              RIGHTS OF WORKERS

                            (Minister's Response)

UMPHATHISWA  WEZABASENZI:  Mhlalingaphambili,  bonke   abantu   beli   lizwe
banamalungelo ngokoMgaqo-siseko weli lizwe. Neculo  lamaRhabe  litsho  ukuba
osityebi nolihlwempu, bonke bakulala ngcwabeni linye. Ngoko  ke  intlupheko,
ubuhlwempu nokunqongophala kwemisebenzi  makungenziwa  ityholo  lokuxhaphaza
amalungelo   abasebenzi.   Naxa    bengenayo    imisebenzi,    behluphekile,
mabaxatyiswe bahlonitshwe. Imithetho ke yezabasebenzi ikholo ukuphumeza  loo
malungelo. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, all the  citizens  of  this  country's
rights are enshrined in the Constitution of this country. One hymn  sung  in
the United Congregational Church of South Africa asserts that the  rich  and
the poor will go into the same grave. Therefore,  poverty  and  scarcity  of
jobs should not be used as a weapon to abuse workers'  rights.  Even  though
some people may not be employed and are poor, they should be  respected  and
valued. Labour laws are there to ensure that those rights are respected.  It
is culture that we are celebrating here today. It is natural  for  each  and
every person on earth to know where they  come  from,  and  where  they  are
going to.]

The ANC will continue to  promote  the  rights  of  workers.  The  ANC  will
promote the right of workers to form trade unions. The ANC will promote  the
right of workers to join trade unions, the right of workers  to  strike  and
the right of workers to bargain for their wages.  The  ANC  will  strengthen
the CCMA. The ANC will strengthen, and  resource  accordingly,  the  Nedlac.
The ANC will see to it that agreements that have been reached at the  Growth
and Development Summit are implemented.

The ANC will continue to defend the rights  of  domestic  workers.  The  ANC
will continue to defend the rights of farm workers. The ANC will  make  sure
that employers, whether they are members of the DA or not, comply  with  the
Basic Conditions of Employment Act. [Applause.]

The ANC will make sure that employers comply with the Labour Relations  Act.
The ANC will make sure that we root out racism in the  workplace  by  making
sure that employers comply with the Employment Equity Act.

We will make sure that workers, together  with  their  employers,  implement
the Skills Plans and we will make sure that the Skills  Development  Act  is
complied with. We will make sure that all employers register their  domestic
workers in this country and that is precisely the reason the people of  this
country will continue to vote for the ANC ... [Applause.] ...  because  they
know exactly where their home is. [Applause.] [Time expired.]

                            MINIBUS TAXI INDUSTRY

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Thank you, Chair. Hon members, I want to  express
my appreciation to the  hon  Schneeman  for  raising  the  question  of  the
Transport Education Authority.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!  Hon  Minister,  can  you  give  us  a
minute? Hon members, can we have some order in  the  House,  please?  Please
proceed, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Thank you, Chair.  The  Transport  Education  and
Training Authority, which is the issue upon which the question  was  raised,
has been one of the successful Setas of which we can be proud.  Now  I  know
that my comrade and colleague, the Minister of  Labour,  has  reported  that
there are a number of Setas that are not doing their work or have  not  done
their work well, or about whom there were problems. I can  safely  say  that
such problems did not exist and do not exist with regard to Teta,  that  is,
the Transport Education and Training Authority.

Teta has done well in that it set up a number of  chambers,  in  which  both
employers and employees are represented. One of the  last  of  the  chambers
which we established is the minibus taxi chamber. The minibus taxi  industry
operators are represented and the trade unions are also represented in  that
chamber. Together they have been able to plan training  programmes,  as  the
hon member pointed out, which will be of  great  benefit  not  only  to  the
industry and to drivers,  but  also  to  commuters.  The  training  involves
driver training, understanding the vehicle and  making  sure  that  vehicles
are safe and in a roadworthy condition.

Training also relates to management; how to manage  the  business  that  you
are running. And then there are also negotiations going  on  with  the  team
under the Minister of Labour to determine hours of work  for  taxi  drivers,
their conditions of service and minimum  conditions  of  service,  including
remuneration. These are all matters around which  the  parties  are  talking
and coming to an agreement. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                                    CRIME

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Thank you, Chairperson. Am I audible?
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, please proceed, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: They say not yet. Is  it  working?  Oh!
There it is.

Thank you very much, Chairperson. A newspaper such as  The  Star  and  other
media in this country are part and parcel of  those  forces,  together  with
Business Against Crime, that have made it their  business  to  join  the  SA
Police Service in a partnership to  fight  against  crime.  Even  today  The
Star's banner headlines are very positive, and so are the stories they  have
done on the annual report that we released yesterday.

But they are not the only ones. Many people out  there  who  are  giving  us
information and helping us are part and parcel of the resources that we  are
deploying  against  criminals  in  this  country.  And  because   of   their
involvement, we have been able to reduce the crime levels in  this  country.
Fortunately for us, all of these people laugh at the whining  and  whingeing
that some of the political organisations we have in this country proffer  as
a political programme.

You know, the other day I participated in a seminar, together with  the  hon
Douglas Gibson, at Pretoria University. The matter of the nature of some  of
the violent and serious attacks against our people was raised,  and  I  said
that where we stand we cannot produce  a  thesis  on  the  causes  of  these
horrendous crimes, but that there are others who should  be  doing  this.  I
know that it is very easy for people to throw these matters at our feet  all
the time. But the fact of the matter is that  there  are  other  people  who
should be investigating and interrogating this question  to  check  why  our
people are committing these horrendous crimes.

The matter of statistics is a matter that guides police officials  in  order
for them to mount operations against criminals. That is what statistics  are
for. I know that during this period of democracy in South Africa every  Tom,
Dick and Harry wants access to statistics. In  fact,  when  you  talk  about
statistics and you talk  about  local  areas,  you  are  talking  about  the
villages where some of our people are, and they know who commits crimes  and
what types of crimes are committed  where  they  live.  They  don't  require
statistics in order for them to understand  these  things.  If  you  require
statistics for you to know whether crime is happening in your area, or  not,
it means that you are not alive to what is happening in your  area  and  you
do not deserve the trust of people who, among others, have put you  in  this
House. Thank you. [Time expired.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order,  hon  Minister!  There  were   two
statements. Do you need a second slot to respond  any  further?  There  were
two statements on safety and security. Are you happy with your  response  to
the statement? Okay. Thank you, Minister.

                    HERITAGE DAY: CELEBRATING OUR FREEDOM

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Chairperson and hon members, fundamental  to  our  struggle
for liberation was the element of restoring the dignity and respect  of  the
indigenous people of South Africa and the peoples of Africa as a  whole.  It
therefore follows that celebrating our freedom should be  a  celebration  of
the restoration of our identity as a people and, more so,  a  South  African
identity. There are many and varied examples that all of  us  can  enumerate
to illustrate our achievements in areas  such  as  the  economy,  education,
sport, women and youth empowerment. The list is long.

As this is the month of heritage, I thought it would be important for me  to
focus on the South African heritage landscape and  how  it  has  contributed
and continues to contribute to the attainment of our  freedom.  The  Collins
Mini Dictionary gives a very simple definition  of  heritage  and  it  says:
``Possessions,  traditions,  conditions  passed  from  one   generation   to
another.''

One of the consequences of colonialism and apartheid  was  the  erasure  and
marginalisation of  cultural  heritage  and  intellectual  contributions  of
noncolonial systems. After centuries of cultural deprivation and  oppression
we are, after almost ten years of  freedom,  confidently  advancing  towards
the stated goal of the Freedom Charter, namely, that the doors  of  learning
and of culture shall be open for all. This situation is being  corrected  by
providing access to the arts, museums and symbols for all  our  citizens  to
have a common cultural heritage and consciousness.

In this context we will have to ensure that every South African  takes  full
advantage of and are exposed  to  the  projects  which  the  Government  has
started. Thus we are once more afforded the opportunity today to reflect  on
the evolution of culture, arts and heritage under our cherished,  democratic
dispensation led by the ANC. In  arts  and  culture,  since  1994,  the  key
challenge facing the Department of  Arts  and  Culture  has  been  to  shift
funding away from serving only a minority  and  to  explore  the  previously
neglected areas of culture and heritage of the majority. Greater  efficiency
and exploitation of the economic potential of the arts were required. It  is
against this background that we are proud to recall today that several  Acts
and  measures  which  passed  through  this  House  set  the  framework  and
established the institutions for transformation, in particular the  Cultural
Institutions Act of 1998 and the National Heritage Resources Act of 1999.

Central  to  these  challenges  was,  and  still  is,  the  task  of  giving
expression to our cultural linguistic diversity. One  instrument  that  will
in no small measure demonstrate our commitment to our  linguistic  diversity
is the National  South  African  Languages  Bill,  which  is  still  in  the
pipeline. To us in the ANC language is the  bedrock  of  cultural  heritage.
Moreover, we believe that language  is  the  one  instrument  through  which
culture is communicated from generation to generation. Now, because  of  the
influences of globalisation, we  live  in  an  era  where  there  is  little
progress towards recognising and embracing diversity and a growing  lack  of
emphasis on developing indigenous languages and multilingualism.

Therefore, given that our Constitution guarantees equality  of  11  official
languages through the National South  African  Languages  Bill  we  hope  to
intensify  our  efforts  to  develop  and  elevate  even  other   previously
disadvantaged languages, for example the San language which  we  are  afraid
is actually  facing  the  real  prospect  of  extinction.  Furthermore,  our
commitment to the challenges of multilingualism was given added credence  at
the National Multilingualism Conference that was held  on  12  and  13  June
this year.

Some of the resolutions taken at that conference include the alignment of  a
uniform language policy in the education sector and  support  of  mechanisms
that engender economic value  to  South  African  indigenous  languages.  It
encourages cohesion and  synergy  in  the  implementation  of  the  National
Language  Policy  Framework  and  it  encourages  the  study  of  indigenous
languages in higher education as a vital  tool  in  career  development.  In
respect of the latter it is encouraging to know that Cabinet has approved  a
task team to  advise  the  Minister  of  Education  on  the  development  of
indigenous languages as a medium of instruction. Indeed  we  have  cause  to
celebrate our national languages.

South Africa, in a postliberation stage,  has  made  tremendous  strides  in
shaping the nature and character of the society in which we live,  and  also
through  the  philosophy  of  reinvention.  Critical  to  this  process   of
reinvention was the objective to find new national symbols and orders  which
reflect, on the one hand, our unity in diversity and, on the other, a  unity
of purpose - these strides started with the  hoisting  of  our  flag  on  27
April 1994. Symbolically this moment represents one of the  decisive  breaks
from the past. It was  indeed  a  moment  of  reconciliation.  Our  national
anthem also strives to achieve this across all the language groups. This  is
another example of reconciliation.

The Department of Arts and Culture,  in  co-operation  with  the  Government
Communication and Information System, commissioned the designing of  symbols
and national orders to further affirm our rebirth as  a  people,  and  these
are the new Coat of Arms and three different  new  national  orders  namely,
the Order of Mapungubwe which has been bestowed on former  president  Nelson
Mandela and that former giant of the struggle Xhamela,  Walter  Sisulu;  the
Order of the Silver Baobab to Noria Mabasa; and the Order of the  Companions
of O.R. Tambo to Mahatma Gandhi  and  Olof  Palme,  both  posthumously,  and
former Zambian President Kenneth David Kaunda.

It goes without saying that previously we, the majority of  South  Africans,
neither identified with nor understood the relevance of the  previous  coats
of arms. To us they were meaningless, but  now  we  are  making  a  tireless
effort to engender the new patriotism our President consistently speaks  of.
We therefore trust that a new popular South African  history,  as  envisaged
by  the  Department  of  Education,  will  ensure  the  capturing  of  these
achievements. Similarly through this history we hope to remind  young  South
Africans not only about their immediate past,  but  also  about  their  more
distant past, and to develop an understanding of the  liberties  and  values
which enrich the struggle for freedom, dignity and  independence  by  former
generations of South Africans.

In building on these foundations and affirming our commitment  to  ensure  a
legacy that would inspire both reflection and teaching,  the  Department  of
Arts and Culture has embarked on a project that would be the  embodiment  of
our collective struggles as a people - the  Freedom  Park  Project.  Freedom
Park will serve  as  a  one-stop  heritage  precinct  and  would  strive  to
accommodate all the emerging experiences and symbols which  unfold  to  tell
one coherent story of the struggle of humanity in South Africa. It  will  be
a place to balance and indeed  engage  the  fragmented  inclination  of  our
multicultural, multiclass and  multi-ethnic  society.  Therefore  there  are
also intergrating processes in  which  Freedom  Park  must  engage  such  as
celebrations and commemorations of nationally significant days which  are  a
feature of any  people  who  share,  however  differently  perceived,  their
history, their territory, their economy, educational  as  well  as  cultural
institutions in a unitary state.

At the heart of Freedom Park's conception is the noble  human  condition  of
spiritual fulfilment derived from  the  willingness  to  cleanse  and  heal.
Central to this is the issue of moral regeneration which, needless  to  say,
is premised on the  age-old  African  philosophy  of  ubuntu.  Moreover,  it
appeals to the hearts and minds of South Africans to  rededicate  themselves
to the celebration of our common humanity and value systems, and  these  are
the values that our ANC-led Government continues to highlight.  It  is  also
the values that we will never abandon.

In this regard we have had contributions and requests for  participation  in
the activities of Freedom Park by various formations, both from  friend  and
foe, dating back to the apartheid era and beyond. More  significant  is  the
close proximity of Freedom Park to the  Voortrekker  Monument,  and  we  are
encouraged to know that the Voortrekker Monument has been  transformed  from
a formerly exclusive and divisive institution to the extent where it is  now
being visited by more than 200 000 people annually from  different  cultures
both domestic and overseas. Having said that, we trust  that  this  symbolic
act and indeed sincere gesture  of  reconciliation  is  appreciated  by  the
Afrikaner community.

In order to achieve its objectives, wide and  exhaustive  consultation  took
place between the Freedom Park Trust and faith-based organisations,  special
interest  groups  and  cultural  bodies  to   ensure   that   the   physical
manifestations of Freedom Park represent  the  wide  cultural  diversity  of
South Africa. This is thanks  to  the  ANC's  vision  of  a  united  nation.
Workshops have  been  held  with  traditional  healers,  youth  and  women's
organisations. The cleansing, healing and  symbolic  reparations  ceremonies
have  introduced  a  shift  from  a   philosophical   discussion   to   both
consultation processes and practical ways of creating the  context  for  the
emergence of Freedom Park. In this respect  Freedom  Park  has  claimed  its
place on the national agenda and in the hearts and minds of the people.

The declaration of certain places as heritage sites has  aroused  a  lot  of
interest with regard to heritage among South Africans. More and more  people
are beginning to identify places  of  historical  significance,  the  latest
being a burial site in Prestwich Street here in Cape Town.  This  has  added
to the already rich heritage of the Western Cape. As  another  example,  the
hon member Mzwandile Masala spent last weekend searching for the remains  of
one of the famous Xhosa  Chiefs,  Chief  Maqoma,  who  fought  against  land
invasion by colonialists, because the family who happen to be  part  of  his
constituency would like to have the Chief's remains buried with the  dignity
deserving his noble deeds. It is a long  list  of  heroes  and  heroines  of
South Africa.

In conclusion, on the eve of the 9th anniversary of Heritage  Day  we  would
like to earnestly call on all South Africans, regardless of race, colour  or
social background, to seize the moment tomorrow and celebrate  with  us  the
beginning of our first decade of freedom - a freedom that  has  endowed  all
South Africans with a new set of values. So while it is time  for  unbridled
celebration and thanksgiving, it is also time for renewed commitment to  the
vision of a better life for all South Africans on a continent  reborn  in  a
better world. Let us go out in our numbers  and  celebrate  our  freedom.  I
thank you. [Applause.]
Mr R  S  NTULI:  Chairperson,  hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  the  word
``heritage'' means many things to many people. To  those  who  live  in  the
Western Cape it might revolve around homes with leafy  vineyards  and  wheat
lands. To others, it might revolve around the sea together  with  the  small
harbours and fishing boats. If you are  from  the  deep  interior,  heritage
could mean the solitude of the bushveld  or  the  towering  majesty  of  our
mountain ranges.

So, what are we celebrating here today? In the understanding of the  DA,  we
are celebrating not  just  a  narrow  sectional  heritage  of  any  race  or
linguistic, religious or cultural group, we are celebrating the totality  of
what it is that has caused us to be labelled ``the rainbow  nation''.  There
is a tendency, when talking about heritage, to think in  terms  of  cultural
heritage only. If we  think  in  that  mode,  we  are  moving  along  fairly
restricted  lines  of  language  only.  This  can   easily   lead   to   the
politicisation of heritage.  Heritage  then  becomes  a  rallying  call  for
polarisation around a narrowly defined set of values which include some  and
exclude others. That bodes no good for the rainbow nation.

We should accept the fact that we are all  sons  and  daughters  of  Africa.
When we come to accept and celebrate that,  then  everything  else  that  we
have contributed by way of culture, language and religion  can  be  seen  as
enriching our heritage. It is then,  and  then  only,  that  we  will,  with
justification, be able to call ourselves the  rainbow  nation.  It  is  this
unity in diversity that binds us together and creates a national  bond  that
is unmovable and unbreakable. It is this South Africanness  that  caused  us
to transcend all bonds, fears and prejudice and  assisted  us  to  find  one
another and reach a negotiated  political  settlement  without  an  external
facilitator. Because political freedom  is  a  priceless  asset.  We  should
jealously protect and nurture it by being  vigilant  at  all  times  through
ensuring that the organs that were created by our Constitution in  order  to
protect it function effectively and efficiently.

On the eve of Heritage Day, we are also celebrating the achievements of  all
our people as  they  continue  to  make  a  difference  towards  creating  a
transformed society that is free from hunger, fear and ignorance, and  based
on the basic principles of nonracism and democracy. It is  in  this  context
that the noble words of the former President, Nelson Mandela,  resonated  so
powerfully in his inauguration address on 27th April 1994 and I quote:


  Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster that lasted  too
  long, must be born a society of which all  humanity  will  be  proud.  We
  have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We dedicate this  day
  to all the heroes and heroines in this country and the rest of the  world
  who sacrificed in many ways and surrendered their lives so that we  could
  be free. Their dreams have become reality. Freedom is their reward.

The struggle  for  liberation  has  been  the  single  most  powerful  theme
throughout 20th century Africa. In South Africa our own  political  struggle
against colonialism has a long history: from the  early  17th  century  when
the Khoi and slaves rose against their masters through  to  land  struggles,
worker resistance and exploitation, as well as the resilience shown  by  the
Afrikaner women  and  children  in  concentration  camps  when  they  fought
against British imperialism.  They  are  all  heroes  and  heroines  in  our
liberation struggle.

In conclusion, I  would  like  to  commend  the  Government  and  all  South
Africans for the establishment of the Freedom Park  in  Pretoria  which  the
former speaker alluded to. The central theme and objective  is  captured  in
this message: ``Motho ke motho ka batho,'' which means  ``I  am  because  we
are and because we are, I am.''

Freedom Park shall strive to accommodate and narrate all  of  South  African
humanity's experiences. It will be an international icon  for  humanity  and
freedom, and it  will  serve  to  inspire  people  all  over  the  world  to
rediscover their humanity. Freedom Park should  strive  to  accommodate  all
emerging experiences and symbols which unfold to tell one coherent story  of
the  struggle  for  humanity  in  South  Africa,  namely  the  struggle  for
survival, land and resources  and  how  they  shape  the  social,  economic,
political and cultural landscape of our country.

Finally, Freedom Park must address the gaps, distortions and biases  in  our
history, and provide a  new  perspective  of  South  Africa's  heritage.  We
believe that the ideas and the visions behind the establishment  of  Freedom
Park are the best way to acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of  all
our heroes and heroines in the liberation struggle.  It  is  also  the  best
legacy we can offer our children and grandchildren so  that  they  can  know
where we come from, the pain and  the  joys  of  the  past  and  our  common
destiny. I thank you. [Applause.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Chairperson, on Heritage Day our focus is on who we  are  as
a people, and what sectors promote our identity  as  a  nation  compared  to
other nations. This  takes  into  consideration  a  wide  range  of  issues,
including our historical inheritance, our creative expression, our  language
and various aspects of our culture.

The Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology  must  be  commended
for giving guidance and leadership in the development of  our  new  identity
within the new democracy. The department is taking  bold  steps  to  promote
our languages and to produce various  symbols  that  express  our  unity  in
diversity.  My  favourite  symbol  is  the  national  coat  of   arms.   Its
multilayered significance is profound,  enabling  us  to  express  our  past
history, our unity in diversity and our aspirations.

I've just said that my favourite symbol is the coat of arms,  which  we  all
see. [Applause.] And I like  it  especially  because  it  puts  forward  the
Khoisan people, the people who were marginalised over a period  of  history.
When we come together to strengthen our nation,  we  need  to  give  them  a
special  place  and,  therefore,  the  logo  says  in  a  Khoisan  language,
``Diverse people unite''. The oval shapes on top  of  one  another  indicate
unity in diversity and also represent femalehood and motherhood.

This symbol is bringing together all the various strands of the  peoples  of
this country. The elephant tusks  represent  power  and  peace,  because  an
elephant is a huge animal, but it will never  attack  you  unless  provoked.
Two people greeting each other mark friendship and harmony.  The  spear  and
knobkierrie symbolise defence, protection  and  feeling  of  security.  They
also represent malehood. Corn ears represent sufficience in  food,  security
and land. I can go on and on, but it is absolutely full of symbolism,  which
is very interesting.

Chairperson, what is still a cause for concern is that there is  no  visible
campaign to promote a full understanding of the meaning of some of our  very
important national symbols, such as the national flag and the coat of  arms.
Few people know what the colours and design of our national  flag  and  coat
of arms signify. This means that subtle  and  intricate  messages  that  are
conveyed by such symbols are often missed.
Perhaps in celebrating our freedom on this  Heritage  Day,  we  should  also
consider the best ways of handling communication  so  that  our  symbols  of
nationalism could be better understood by all people, in order to  foster  a
comprehensive  feeling  of  patriotism.  Establishing  and  promoting   firm
patriotic values is especially difficult  in  our  country  because  of  our
unfortunate history of racism and sexism over a long period of time.

In spite of difficulties, we need to continue to look for solutions.  It  is
perhaps instructive that this Heritage Day that we celebrate every  year  on
24 September originates from commemoration  of  the  day  when  one  of  the
greatest sons of Africa passed away. I refer to King Shaka,  ``Ilembe  eleqa
amanye amalembe ngokukhalipha'' [he whose  intelligence  outstrips  that  of
all others in his rank]. The very first sentence of  his  praises,  as  just
quoted, indicates that he  was  regarded  as  an  exceptional  person,  even
unique in the depth of his intelligence.

Translated into English it means, ``he whose intelligence  outstripped  that
of all others in  his  rank''.  A  young  Shaka  realised  that  unless  the
indigenous peoples came together to form a strong force,  they  would  never
be able to cope with the  new  settlers.  The  people  he  sought  to  bring
together constituted various strong groupings  that  shared  clanship  ties.
Such units of people were self-sufficient, occupying  defined  stretches  of
land, and independent in their economic and political structures.

Their identity with their clan's social structure was so  strong  that  most
of the clans had visible physical marks, thus wearing  their  identity  with
pride. Yet King Shaka found a way of persuading so many people who  did  not
belong together to cast in their lot with his  efforts  of  building  a  new
nation. What is even  more  impressive  is  that  such  nation-building  was
achieved within a period of only eight years, between 1820  and  1828.  When
he died at KwaDukuza, the nationhood he had produced continued to  flourish,
the demolition of which was the  main  reason  behind  the  attacks  of  the
British armies in 1879.

What we learn from this particular  history  of  that  section  of  our  new
nation is that it is possible to contain diversity within  the  umbrella  of
nationhood. The Zulu nation forged by King Shaka  was  made  up  of  diverse
people, who retained, nevertheless,  their  particular  individual  clanship
ties, as expressed in the leadership of their amakhosi up to today.

The amakhosi, in turn, found expression in the  monarchical  structure  that
symbolises the apex of the Zulu nation. What we further learn is that it  is
wise to build around what is already in  existence  and  enhance  it  rather
than destroy it, only to start all over again. It  is  therefore  gratifying
to realise that practically, all efforts at inclusive  nation-building  have
come out of Government's efforts, and most specially through the  Department
of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology.

However, we must not be complacent. There is still a lot of work to be  done
to realise a singular and identifiable South Africanness in all citizens  of
our country. One of the ways of keeping the  efforts  growing  strong  could
come out of well-designed researches  to  examine  how  some  of  our  great
heroes, such as King Shaka  and  King  Moshweshwe  of  Lesotho,  managed  to
foster the spirit of nationhood.

Research programmes of this type could identify some of the  main  stumbling
blocks that frustrate nation-building and could also come up  with  measures
to accelerate the efforts. My party and I wish  you  all  a  happy  Heritage
Day. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M J PHALA: Hon Chairperson, colleagues, hon members of Parliament,  today
we are celebrating Heritage Day.

Ke setšo seo re se ketekago mo lehono. Ke tlhago ya motho yo  mongwe  le  yo
mongwe mo lefaseng go tseba gore o tšwa  kae,  o  ya  kae.  (Translation  of
Sepedi paragraph follows.)
[It is culture that we are celebrating here today. It is natural  for  every
person to know where he/she comes from and where he/she is going.]

Since its inception, the ANC  has  been  committed  to  eliminating  racism,
oppression and exploitation. In order to do  so,  the  emancipation  of  the
blacks has been the theme of the day. That means that since 1912 the aim  of
black people, who were oppressed, was to get freedom.

When we met in Kliptown in 1955, it was clear that we needed to chart a  way
forward. Hence, we came up with a clause that says:  ``All  national  groups
shall have equal rights.'' This means  that  all  people  shall  have  equal
rights to use their own languages, and to develop  their  own  folk  culture
and customs. That is what we are doing today.

Heritage Day for us in South Africa means that we need to  nurture  the  day
because, in order for us to go ahead, we need  to  graciously  look  at  the
resources that we have  in  our  country.  You  know,  when  we  talk  about
heritage, especially in South  Africa,  it  is  customarily  we,  the  black
people all over the provinces, who have a really wonderful heritage. In  the
olden days, nature was very useful to us and we  need  to  go  back  to  our
roots  and  use  what  is  provided  for  us  by  nature   efficiently   and
effectively.

[In the past we had our traditional games. Those who know, are aware of  how
we used to play. It was to showcase our culture.  Some  of  the  games  were
merabaraba, meruba, diketo and masiba. Those who  were  once  herdboys  know
how we used to make lesiba.  When  we  called  each  other  to  the  chief's
kraals, the Ngwatos, the Kgolokwe Ngwatos and the Mathebes, they would  blow
the trumpets and the community would know that they  were  being  called  to
the  chief's  kraal,  to  be  updated   about   the   latest   developments.
[Applause.]]

As Africans in Africa, we need to share  our  natural  resources  and  value
them, and utilise what we have towards  economic  development.  The  Freedom
Charter says: ``The  people  shall  share  in  the  country's  wealth!''  It
further says: ``The national wealth of our country, the  heritage  of  South
Africans, shall be restored to the people.''

Celebrating Heritage Day contributes to the local economy and  therefore  it
is critical to implement recreation. A nation that  does  not  celebrate  of
its culture does not know where it comes from. Really, we have  many  people
who do not know ...

... setlogo sa bona gore ba tšwa kae, ba ya kae. Ba bona ge  ba  wet  še  mo

themselves in South Africa by sheer luck and  pushed  us  around.  Gone  are
those days.]

We are a country with diverse dialects that we are proud of.

[In the past we were able to communicate with people in other countries.  We
knew their languages and their cultures and we were able to agree  with  one
another.]

We are proud South Africans, and we do not regret being who we  are  because
we are unique. That makes us Africans. When Comrade President says he is  an
African and further says -
  I owe my being to the hills  and  the  valleys,  the  mountains  and  the
  glades, the rivers, the deserts, the trees, the flowers, the seas and the
  ever-changing seasons that define the face of our native land,

he refers to the Heritage Day we have today.

The ANC must protect its own cultural heritage, including history,  as  part
of our  major  contribution  to  South  Africa.  African  national  identity
ensures ways to keep that history alive  and  pass  it  from  generation  to
generation.

Se, se ra gore re tlogetše setšo  sa  gaborena,  gagologolo  lena  boNgwato.

cultures, especially you, the Ngwatos. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Dr S J GOUS: Voorsitter, ``erfenis'' is volgens die Verklarende  Woordeboek,
``die somtotaal van die regte en pligte van 'n oorledene''. Erf  en  erfenis
word in die reël geassosieer met iets wat 'n mens verniet  kry,  en  miskien
is dit die rede waarom sekere mense argeloos  staan  teenoor  ons  nasionale
erfenis. Hulle is soos bedorwe kinders wat hul erfporsie verkwis het.

Alhoewel ons erfenis oënskynlik verniet is, is dit by nadere  ondersoek  nie
heeltemal die waarheid nie. Feit  is,  iemand  het  die  een  of  ander  tyd
daarvoor betaal; net soos ons nou besig is om by te dra tot die  nalatenskap
van ons kinders. 'n Tweede waarheid wat duidelik na vore tree,  is  dat  ons
nasionale erfenis veel meer as net fauna en flora behels. Dit sluit  in  ons
gene, ons kultuur, ja,  al  die  verskillende  kulture,  monumente,  geboue,
kunswerke, musiek, ensovoorts.

Onder andere sluit dit ook ons sogenaamde vryheid in. Net soos  met  erfenis
aanvaar sekere Suid-Afrikaners  vandag  hulle  vryheid  baie  maklik  en  as
vanselfsprekend. Ons land is een van die min suksesverhale  van  vryheid  en
geregtigheid in die wêreld, maar ons wat vandag hier bly, is  geneig  om  te
gou te vergeet waar  dit  vandaan  kom.  Ons  hanteer  dikwels  ons  vryheid
onverskillig en waardeer dit nie genoeg nie, omdat  dit  oënskynlik  verniet
was. Feit is, miskien voel dit net vir ons asof dit verniet  was,  maar  dit
beteken glad nie dat daar nie 'n duur prys voor betaal is nie.  Ons  vryheid
is met bloed gekoop - met die bloed van mense wat bereid was om te  sterf  -
en daarom kan ons vandag vry wees. Elke enkele mens in Suid-Afrika staan  in
die skuld by hierdie mense wat hul lewe gegee het vir  dit  wat  ons  vandag
het. Ons moet dus  onthou  waar  ons  vandaan  kom.  Ons  moet  ons  erfenis
vertroetel en nooit afskeep omdat dit sogenaamd verniet bekom is nie.

Die grootste fout wat  ons  kan  maak,  is  om  dit  as  vanselfsprekend  te
aanvaar. Ons moet nooit vergeet dat dit jare geneem het om te kom  waar  ons
vandag is nie. Dit het 'n oorlog  en  'n  jare  lange  struggle  gekos,  wat
duisende mense se lewe gekos het, voordat  Suid-Afrikaners  vandag  kan  sê:
ons is werklik vry. Eers was dit die Anglo-Boereoorlog wat  Suid-Afrika  vry
moes maak  van  Britse  kolonialisme;  toe  die  jare  lange  struggle  teen
apartheid  wat  die  vryheid  van  alle  Suid-Afrikaners,  en  nie  net   'n
uitgesoekte groepie mense nie, moes verseker. Dit is  eers  oor  die  laaste
tien jaar dat almal in Suid-Afrika werklik kan sê: ons is vry.

Ons moet net onthou dat vryheid met niks anders as bloed  gekoop  word  nie.
Dit is die duurste vorm van betaling wat daar is. Erfenis en vryheid is  dus
nooit verniet nie. Alle oorloë, oor die wêreld deur die eeue  heen,  is  net
met een rede geveg, naamlik om  vryheid.  Mens  en  dier  het  'n  ingeboude
strewe na vryheid. Dit is een van die min dinge waarvoor hy bereid sal  wees
om te sterf. Dit kan dus onder geen omstandighede geringgeskat word nie.  In
Suid-Afrika is ons in die posisie dat vryheid amper tasbaar in ons  Grondwet
en Handves van Menseregte weerspieël word.  Vryheid  kom  egter  nie  sonder
verantwoordelikheid nie.  'n  Bekende  Nobelpryswenner,  Albert  Camus,  het
eenmaal gesê:


  Freedom is nothing else than a chance to better oneself.

Die vraag is dus: Wat maak Suid-Afrikaners met hulle vryheid? Hoe  wend  ons
ons vryheid aan om onsself en ons land te verbeter? Hoe  suksesvol  het  ons
ons vryheid oor die afgelope tien jaar gebruik om van Suid-Afrika  'n  beter
plek te maak? 'n Mens kan nooit oor  vryheid  praat  sonder  om  van  geykte
clichés en abstrakte beeldspraak  gebruik  te  maak  nie.  Vryheid  is  iets
abstraks, wanneer 'n mens dit het. Maar, wanneer mens dit nie het  nie,  dan
besef jy die praktiese implikasies daarvan. Wanneer vryheid vir ons as Suid-
Afrikaners 'n abstrakte konsep raak wat nie meer gewig  dra  nie,  moet  ons
net kyk na streke soos Zimbabwe, die Midde-Ooste, Sentraal-Afrika, Indië  en
Pakistan waar mense vandag nog veg  vir  vryheid,  want  dan  besef  jy  hoe
bevoorreg ons in Suid-Afrika is om te bly  waar  die  praktiese  implikasies
van vryheid so alledaags is dat ons  dit  as  vanselfsprekend  aanvaar.  Die
enigste manier waarop Suid-Afrika  dit  as  erfenis  kan  vier,  is  om  ons
daartoe te verbind en ons vryheid daagliks tot voordeel van die land  en  sy
mense te gebruik; om verantwoordelik daarmee om te gaan en  altyd  te  besef
aan wie ons dit te danke het. Ons moet ook  onderneem  om  ons  vryheid  ten
alle koste te beskerm, want 'n mens waardeer eers  jou  vryheid  wanneer  jy
dit die dag nie meer het nie. Kahlil Gibran het gesê:
  Life without liberty is like a body without spirit.

In Suid-Afrika het elkeen die geleentheid om liggaam en siel te  wees.  Laat
ons dit nie misbruik  nie.  Dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr  S  J  GOUS:  Chairperson,  according  to  the  Verklarende  Woordeboek,
``heritage'' is ``die somtotaal van die regte en pligte van  'n  oorledene''
[the sum of the rights  and  duties  of  a  deceased  person].  Inherit  and
heritage are generally associated with something  one  gets  for  free,  and
that is perhaps the reason  that  certain  people  are  indifferent  to  our
national heritage. They are like spoilt children who have  squandered  their
share of the inheritance.

Although our heritage is apparently for free, on closer  investigation  this
is not entirely true. The fact is that at some time  someone  paid  for  it;
just as we are now in the process of contributing to  the  heritage  of  our
children. A second truth that emerges quite clearly  is  that  our  national
heritage entails much more than just  fauna  and  flora.  It  comprises  our
genes, our culture, yes, all the different cultures,  monuments,  buildings,
artworks, music, etc.

It also includes, amongst other things, our so-called freedom. Just as  with
our heritage, certain South Africans nowadays take their freedom  very  much
in their stride and they also take it for granted. Our  country  is  one  of
the few success stories of freedom and justice in the world,  but  those  of
us who live here at present tend to forget too quickly where it  came  from.
We often deal with our freedom carelessly and don't  appreciate  it  enough,
because apparently it was for free. The fact is, maybe we just think it  was
for free, but that does not  mean  that  it  wasn't  paid  for  dearly.  Our
freedom was bought with blood - the blood of people  who  were  prepared  to
die - and that is why we can be free today. Every  single  person  in  South
Africa is indebted to these people who sacrificed their lives  for  what  we
have today. We need to cherish our heritage and never neglect it because  it
was presumably gained for nothing.

Our biggest mistake would be to take it for granted. We should never  forget
that it took us years to get where we are today. It cost  us  a  war  and  a
struggle that continued for years and  claimed  thousands  of  lives  before
South Africans can say today: We are truly free.  First  we  had  the  Anglo
Boer War that was supposed to free South Africa  from  British  colonialism;
then the struggle against apartheid lasting for years  in  order  to  secure
the freedom of all South Africans, and not just a  select  little  group  of
people. It is only for the past ten years that all of  us  in  South  Africa
can truly say: We are free.

We should just remember that freedom is bought with nothing  but  blood.  It
is the most costly form of payment that there is.  Therefore,  heritage  and
freedom are never free of charge.  All  wars,  across  the  world  and  over
centuries, have been fought for one reason only, namely for  freedom.  Human
beings and animals have an innate drive to be free. It is  one  of  the  few
things  he  is  prepared  to  die  for.  This  should  not,  therefore,   be
underestimated under  any  circumstances.  We  in  South  Africa  are  in  a
position that freedom is reflected almost tangibly in our  Constitution  and
Bill of Rights. However, freedom does not come without  responsibility.  The
well-known Nobel Prize winner, Albert Camus, once said:


  Freedom is nothing else than a chance to better oneself.

Therefore, the question is: What do South Africans do  with  their  freedom?
How do we harness  our  freedom  in  order  to  improve  ourselves  and  our
country? How successfully have we used our freedom over the past  ten  years
to make South Africa a better  place?  One  can  never  talk  about  freedom
without having to resort to  stereotyped  clichés  and  abstract  figurative
speech. Freedom is something abstract, when one has it. But when  you  don't
have it, you realise what the practical implications  are  as  a  result  of
that. When freedom becomes an abstract concept that no  longer  carries  any
weight for us as South Africans, we simply have  to  look  at  regions  like
Zimbabwe, the Middle East, Central Africa, India  and  Pakistan,  where,  to
this day, people are fighting for freedom, because  then  one  realises  how
privileged we are in South Africa to live in a country where  the  practical
implications of freedom are so common that we are  taking  it  for  granted.
The only way South Africa could celebrate this as  heritage,  is  to  commit
ourselves to it, and to use our freedom every day  to  the  benefit  of  the
country and its people; to deal with it  in  a  responsible  manner  and  to
remind ourselves always whom we owe it to. We also have to resolve to  guard
our freedom at all costs, because one only cherishes one's freedom  the  day
one no longer has it. Kahlil Gibran said:


  Life without liberty is like a body without spirit.

In South Africa everyone has the opportunity to be body and spirit.  Let  us
not abuse that. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chairman, the ACDP celebrates Heritage  Day  conscious  of  the
rich heritage passed on to  us  by  people  like  William  Wilberforce,  who
spearheaded movements to fight for the abolition of  slavery,  and  Florence
Nigthingale,  who  started  the  nursing  profession.  Christian  character,
sacrificial giving and faith inspired ordinary people  to  leave  behind  an
extraordinary heritage for which we are grateful.

This is as good a time as any to consider exactly what  heritage  or  legacy
we will in fact pass on to future generations. Of course, the whole  concept
of future generations is itself at stake with fertility rates in the  entire
developed world being below replacement levels.

Contrary to widespread perceptions of overpopulation,  humans  are  in  fact
endangered species. Yet, policies  of  contraception  and  legislation  like
abortion on demand continue to  target  population  growth.  The  impact  of
international law on South African law is evident as new norms are  used  to
destroy innocent lives and deconstruct long-standing  concepts  of  marriage
and family.

Until  relatively  recently  the  concepts  of  marriage,  family  and  even
children's rights were not commonly linked with international law.  However,
human rights issues have taken a centre stage at  international  conferences
as the UN has assumed the role of world policy-maker.

International law has clearly become hostile  to  long-standing  notions  of
marriage  and  natural  family  and  the  rearing  of  children,  presenting
marriage, motherhood, fatherhood and  childhood  as  cultural  and  economic
problems that demand immediate solutions.

Prior to the adoption of the Convention on  the  Rights  of  the  Child,  no
legal system in the world granted autonomy rights to children. In fact,  the
world limited children's autonomy in the short  run  in  order  to  maximise
their development of actual autonomy in the long run.  This  short-circuited
this process by legally granting rather than  actually  teaching  autonomous
capacity to children and  ignores  the  realities  of  education  and  child
development to the point of abandoning children to a mere illusion  of  real
autonomy.

There are many potentially harmful  autonomy  provisions  contained  in  the
Convention, including the right to privacy and the right to free speech  and
association. Legislation currently being considered at Parliament  in  South
Africa promises  to  accelerate  this  international  agenda.  Firstly,  the
criminal law  or  Sexual  Offences  Amendment  Bill,  which  surreptitiously
lowers the age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual sexual  acts;  and
secondly, the proposed Children's Bill which will make  anyone  who  refuses
to give condoms to 12-year-olds a criminal, and  outlaws  parental  corporal
punishment.

In South Africa homosexual rights do  not  only  have  protection  over  and
above the rights of other citizens  through  the  Constitution,  legislation
and now court judgements, but homosexual lifestyles are also  promoted  with
taxpayers' money.
New legislation giving relationships of all descriptions the same status  as
marriage is presently being dealt with by the SA  Law  Commission  and  will
proceed to Parliament in due course. Research confirms that  natural  family
structures benefit nearly every aspect of  a  child's  wellbeing,  including
greater education opportunities, better emotional and physical health,  less
substance abuse, lower incidences of early sexual activity for  girls,  less
deliquency for boys and reduced poverty.

If we want our children and their children to celebrate Heritage Day in  the
years to come and not live in the nightmare  emerging  we  must  refute  and
resist the lies that undermine family, marriage, motherhood, fatherhood  and
childhood.  In   South   Africa   this   will   necessitate   a   government
uncompromisingly based on biblical principles to  untangle  the  legislative
mess we are in.

Children are to be nurtured, protected,  educated,  disciplined  and  loved.
Family  values  must  be  forcefully  defended  and  promoted.  Respect  for
parenthood is key in building stable families. We must ensure that  children
are allowed to enjoy the benefits  of  growing  up  in  a  safe  and  secure
environment.

Not only has our history  of  apartheid  been  responsible,  but  now  South
Africa's humanist Constitution has taken over and places itself above  God's
law, and that is responsible for the decline in moral  values.  It  is  time
for change. [Time expired.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members,  the  most  important
heritage of South Africa is not our minerals, our land  or  our  businesses,
but our people. In our heritage of  human  capital  we  have  a  history  of
diversity, creativity and transformation. This makes us a rich nation.

As  a  nation  we  should  be  proud  of  our  rainbow  heritage  which  was
contributed to by different cultures and many histories  over  thousands  of
years.  One  such  heritage,  for  example,  is  found  in  our   mountains,
especially the Drakensberg range and the Cape mountains.  Here  the  art  of
people of ancient cultures, who roamed our country thousands of  years  ago,
tells the stories of their everyday life. The San people  left  a  priceless
and unique collection of Stone Age paintings and engravings  to  the  people
of South Africa. Their rock art shows hunting expeditions with  hunters  and
animals, their observation of new cultures and people entering their  world,
and important events in society.

This ancient rock art also captures visions of the spiritual  world  of  the
San. Complex symbols and metaphors illustrate the supernatural  powers  they
received from nature. The oldest rock art in South Africa  is  over  10  200
years old, namely an engraved stone discovered in a  cave  near  Kuruman  in
the Northern Cape.

The Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site on the border of  Gauteng  tells
us even  more  about  the  history  of  our  ancestors  than  any  place  of
comparable size elsewhere in the world. Evidence of an  early  African  Homo
erectus, known as the first easily identifiable true human ancestor  capable
of controlling the use of fire, was found in the Cradle  of  Humankind  site
in our country. This particular heritage dates back to  between  1  and  1,5
million years ago.

It was at the Sterkfontein caves that Mrs Ples, the  fossil  remains  of  an
adult apeman - please note it is not a woman  -  were  discovered  in  1947.
This 2,5 million year-old fossil proved that humanity's roots were  in  fact
African.

Over the centuries many changes have taken place in South  Africa,  and  our
diversified  cultural  groups   have   adjusted   to   these   changes   and
transformations. Our nation was  involved  in  many  wars,  adversities  and
conflicts. In most cases transformation and change was a painful and a  long
process, and yet  each  time  the  peoples  of  South  Africa  succeeded  in
transforming, surviving and becoming stronger and more resilient.

In 1994 we elected our first democratically  elected  government  through  a
peaceful  process.   International   countries   described   the   political
transformation  as  a  miracle.  Yet,  the  transformation  process  is  not
complete, and some people have difficulty in accepting transformation.

In hierdie verband wil ek graag 'n woord rig aan  minderheidsgroepe  in  die
transformasieproses, en in die besonder  aan  Afrikaanssprekende  mense;  om
hierdie rede praat ek nou in Afrikaans.

Ons land staan in erfenismaand aan die vooraand van  die  tiende  herdenking
van ons vryheid. Ons kan met trots terugkyk op wat  ons  bereik  het  sedert
die  einde  van  apartheid.  Ten  spyte  van   uitdagings   wat   deurlopend
aangespreek moet word, soos  armoede,  werkloosheid  en  misdaad,  is  Suid-
Afrika vandag 'n beter land om in te bly as  onder  apartheid.  Ons  het  'n
volhoubare  groeiende  ekonomie,   'n   stabiele   politieke   stelsel,   'n
onafhanklike  regstelsel,  'n  toonaangewende  Grondwet,  en  'n  land   wat
internasionaal aanvaar en erken word. Ons land presteer op  talle  terreine.
Op die Afrika-kontinent is ons 'n leier, wat in inisiatiewe soos  die  Nepad
weerspieël word.
Wanneer ek egter artikels en briewe in koerante lees oor  Afrikaanssprekende
mense sien ek begrippe soos onsekerheid, in gevoel van in verlies  van  mag,
onwelkom,  moedeloos,  onttrekking,  apatie,  besluiteloosheid,   emigrasie,
ensovoorts. In erfenismaand is dit dan miskien gerade om vir 'n  oomblik  te
besin en te reflekteer. Het minderheidsgroepe 'n toekoms  in  hierdie  land,
en kan minderheidsgroepe 'n bydrae maak? Die antwoord is 'n besliste ja.

Ek   wil   graag   aan   lede   van    minderheidsgroepe,    en    spesifiek
Afrikaanssprekendes, vra: Kom word saam met ander Suid-Afrikaners  deel  van
die transformasieproses, want daar is plek aan  die  tafel  vir  ons  almal.
Kweek 'n positiewe gesindheid teenoor ons land en medeburgers, en  laat  dit
weerspieël word in ons ingesteldheid teenoor mense.  Afrikaanssprekendes  is
deel van die nuwe gemeenskap. Kom met selfvertroue na  vore,  en  help  werk
aan oplossings vir die uitdagings wat die land in die gesig staar.

Die politieke leierskap van ons land  wil  ervaar  dat  Afrikaanssprekendes,
soos  ander  landsburgers,  deel  moet  wees  van  die   rekonsiliasie-   en
nasiebouproses in ons land. Die meerderheid van die kiesers in ons land  sal
dit verwelkom dat ook Afrikaanssprekendes  met  vertroue  en  hoop  vir  die
toekoms sal deelneem aan die heropbou en ontwikkeling van ons land. Ons  kan
'n waardevolle en kosbare bydrae lewer tot die  uitbou  en  versterking  van
ons  nuwe  demokratiese  bestel.  (Translation   of   Afrikaans   paragraphs
follows.)

[In this respect I would like to address the minority groups that  are  part
of the the transformation process, and in particular the  Afrikaans-speaking
people. That is why I am now speaking in Afrikaans.

In this heritage month our country is on the eve of  the  tenth  anniversary
of our freedom. We can look back with pride on what we have  achieved  since
the  end  of  apartheid.  Despite  challenges  that  have  to  be  addressed
continuously, such as poverty, unemployment and crime,  South  Africa  today
is a better country to live in than under apartheid. We have  a  sustainable
and growing economy, a stable political system, an independent judiciary,  a
leading constitution and a country  that  is  internationally  accepted  and
acknowledged. Our country is achieving in all fields. We  are  a  leader  on
the African continent, as reflected in initiatives such as Nepad.

When I read articles and  letters  in  the  press  about  Afrikaans-speaking
people, however, I note concepts such as uncertainty, a feeling of  loss  of
power, unwelcome, disheartened, withdrawal, apathy, indecision,  emigration,
etc. It may be advisable then, in heritage month, to  meditate  and  reflect
on this. Do minority groups have a future in this country, and can  minority
groups make a contribution? The answer is a definite yes.

I would like to say to members of minority groups, and specifically  to  the
Afrikaans-speaking people: Let's become part of the  transformation  process
with other South Africans, because there is enough space at  the  table  for
all of us. Foster  a  positive  attitude  towards  our  country  and  fellow
citizens, and let this be reflected in our  attitude  towards  people.  Come
forward self-confidently and assist in finding solutions to  the  challenges
that are facing the country.

The political leadership of  our  country  wants  to  feel  that  Afrikaans-
speaking  people,  like  other  citizens,  are  part  of  the   process   of
reconciliation  and  nation-building  in  our  land.  The  majority  of  our
country's voters will welcome the participation  of  the  Afrikaans-speaking
people in our reconstruction and development, trusting in  and  hopeful  for
the future.]

As indicated in the beginning of my speech, the most important  heritage  in
South Africa is our people. On Heritage Day  we  should  also  remember  the
high quality of African human capital which existed in South Africa  in  the
early  1900s,   whose   life   contributions   are   not   well   documented
unfortunately. This is an opportunity to reflect on their  contributions  to
our nation.

These quality people include for instance the Rev John Dube, leader  of  the
Dube deputation to England in 1914, to present to the King  of  England  the
grievances of the African people in  South  Africa  and  the  injustices  of
racial laws. Rev Dube was educated in America and was  the  first  president
of the ANC.

Other African contributors  to  our  heritage  of  excellent  human  capital
include: Firstly, Mr Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu  who  obtained  a  BA  degree
from London University and an education diploma from Birmingham  University.
He returned to South Africa in 1914 to play an important role in  developing
the teaching profession. Secondly,  Nurse  Mangena  was  one  of  the  first
qualified African nurses in South Africa in  1910.  Thirdly,  Mrs  Charlotte
Maxeke, born in 1874 in South Africa,  who  was  an  exceptionally  talented
singer and musician, and who  obtained  a  BSc  degree  at  the  Wilberforce
University  in  Ohio,  USA.  She  returned  to  South  Africa  and  made  an
outstanding contribution in the interest of our people. Fourthly, there  was
Dr D S Moleme who obtained his degree at the Medical School of  the  Glasgow
University. He commenced his practice in Mafikeng and distinguished  himself
as a medical practitioner of exceptional quality in the early 1920s.

It also includes Dr Walter Rubusana,  educated  at  Lovedale  from  1876  to
1882, who wrote ``History of SA from the African standpoint''  and  received
a honorary degree of Doctor of  Philosophy  from  the  Mckinley  University.
Then there was Dr P ka I Seme who studied law in the  USA  and  England.  He
returned to South Africa in 1910 and established a  law  practice.  In  1928
Columbia University, in the United States of America, conferred on  him  the
degree LLD. His brother graduated with a Doctor  of  Science  from  the  New
York University. Finally, there was Dr A B Xuma who was born in Engcobo  and
who obtained  a  number  of  international  degrees  in  medicine,  surgery,
midwifery and gynaecology in the early 1920s.

These are examples of world class citizens from  South  Africa,  people  who
were recognised internationally at the turn of  the  previous  century,  but
who are  not  well  documented  in  our  history  books  and  therefore  not
accordingly acknowledged. The list is not complete, and you may add to  this
list of quality people. Let us celebrate and  honour  the  contributions  of
our people in celebrating our freedom.

In conclusion, let me acknowledge in the gallery  two  young  visitors  from
India, Bejush Selat and Mano  Sohan,  who  are  cycling  around  the  world,
carrying out the message of Mahatma Gandhi's peace mission. We wish you  all
of the best ... [Applause.] We wish you all of the  best  on  your  journey.
Thank you for visiting Parliament. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members,  under  democracy
we have taken significant constitutional  and  legislative  strides  towards
protecting and promoting our physical heritage in terms of the artefacts  as
well as our national splendour. These measures are not necessarily  the  be-
all and end-all of preserving our heritage because heritage does not  reside
solely in certain artefacts, places or institutions and cannot  be  advanced
solely with legislative measures.

It is my firm belief that heritage in its deepest, most  significant  sense,
is that vital component of identity  that  resides  within  the  hearts  and
minds of the people. When we celebrate and seek  to  promote  heritage,  our
actions should focus on the people, each and every single South African  who
is the true custodian of heritage. We should seek to address this  and  have
it captured in our national Constitution as part of  our  mission  statement
which should read  as  follows:  We  are  united  in  the  spirit  of  South
Africanism by our common passion for our country,  mobilising  the  creative
spirit inherent in our rich diversity towards transformation into a  winning
nation.

If we as a nation want to celebrate our freedom and  promote  our  heritage,
our success will depend not so much on how many  museums  and  monuments  we
build, but on how all South Africans live and  share  their  heritage  on  a
daily basis with each other. Do we reach out to each other  and  learn  each
other's  cultures,  languages  and  traditions?  Do  we  discover  the  many
commonalities  and  revel  in  the  fresh  perspectives  revealed   by   our
differences? If in our places of work, our  schools  and  neighbourhoods  we
can answer these questions positively, then  we  would  have  protected  and
promoted our heritage far better. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr C P  MULDER:  Geagte  mevrou  die  Adjunkspeaker,  ek  het  'n  toespraak
voorberei, maar ek dink nie ek gaan by hom uitkom nie. Ek wil graag  reageer
op die agb lid dr Koornhof se toespraak van nou net.

Dr Koornhof het  spesifiek  verwys  na  minderhede  in  Suid-Afrika  en  het
spesifiek  verwys  na  die  Afrikaanssprekende  gemeenskap.  Hy't  die  punt
aangevoer dat Afrikaanssprekendes  moet  dankbaar  wees  vir  die  positiewe
veranderinge  in  Suid-Afrika  en  hy  het  gewys  op  'n  wye   reeks   van
veranderinge en verbeteringe wat die afgelope 10 jaar ingetree het.  Hy  het
ook verwys na die werklikheid. Briewe verskyn van mense wat  sê  hulle  voel
uitgesluit in Suid-Afrika. Hulle voel dat hulle  nie  deel  is  nie  en  dat
hulle nie welkom is nie en hulle nie 'n  bydrae  het  om  te  maak  nie.  Ek
verstaan dit is dr Koornhof se standpunt en dit is hoekom hy dit sê.

My probleem spruit voort uit my eie  ervaring.  Dis  die  ervaring  wat  die
Vryheidsfront gehad het die afgelope 10 jaar in hierdie  Parlement  met  die
regerende party, die ANC.

Die probleem van die regerende party, die ANC,  was  nog  deurlopend  gewees
dat hul uitgangspunt en filosofie is,  om  aan  ander  gemeenskappe  en  aan
ander partye te sê: ``Be reasonable, see it our way.'' ``Be reasonable,  see
it our way.'', want die meerderheid kan nooit begrip  hê  en  hy  het  nooit
begrip vir die standpunte van minderhede nie. Hy het nooit  begrip  vir  dít
wat belangrik is  vir  ander  gemeenskappe  nie.  En  daarom  was  die  hele
benadering van die regerende party, wat die meerderheid is, nog  altyd:  Kom
maak 'n bydrae. Julle is baie welkom. Kom help ons om  dit  beter  te  maak.
Maar kom leef dit uit deur middel van die meerderheid. Ek  wil  nie  met  dr
Koornhof baklei nie, want dit is klaarblyklik hoekom hy ook in die ANC is.

Die ANC het nog nooit ... Ek wil vir die ANC of dr Koornhof  vra,  noem  vir
my een voorbeeld van 'n  gemeenskap,  enige  minderheidsgemeenskap,  wat  in
hierdie land die reg het om 'n besluit van sy eie te neem oor  'n  saak  wat
vir daardie gemeenskap van  wesenlike  belang  is.  Daar  is  nie  een  nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Nee, dit  probeer  julle  ook  keer.  Dit  het  julle  ook
probeer keer.

Mnr D V BLOEM: Orania!

Dr C P MULDER: Mnr Bloem, jy verstaan nie die goed nie. Nou  wil  ek  vir  u
sê, die probleem is dat 'n minderheidsgemeenskap die reg moet hê om  homself
te wees. Hy kan homself nie net eenvoudig uitleef deur die meerderheid  nie.
Ek het nie uitgekom waar ek wil nie; en tien teen een kan ek  dit  nie  doen
nie.

Natuurlik is daar begrip en plek vir ons almal in  hierdie  land.  Maar  dan
moet daar werklike begrip wees dat minderhede hulleself kan uitleef. Dan  is
daar 'n rol en 'n plek vir elkeen. Maar nie deur die  meerderheid  nie.  Die
opsie van ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[Dr C P MULDER: Hon Madam Deputy Speaker, I prepared a speech, but I do  not
think I am going to get to it. I would like to respond to the speech of  the
hon member Dr Koornhof, of a moment ago.

Dr  Koornhof  specifically  referred  to  minorities  in  South  Africa  and
referred to the Afrikaans-speaking community  in  particular.  He  made  the
point that Afrikaans speakers should be grateful for  the  positive  changes
in  South  Africa  and  he  pointed  out  a  broad  range  of  changes   and
improvements which have taken place  during  the  past  10  years.  He  also
referred to reality. Letters appear from people who say they  feel  excluded
in South Africa. They feel that they are not involved and that they are  not
welcome and do not have a contribution to make. I understand  that  that  is
Dr Koornhof's position and that is why he says that.

My problem arises from my own experience. This is the experience  which  the
Freedom Front has had during the past 10 years with the  ruling  party,  the
ANC, in this Parliament.

The problem of the ruling party, the ANC, has consistently been  that  their
point of departure and philosophy was to say to other communities and  other
parties: ``Be reasonable, see it our way.''  ``Be  reasonable,  see  it  our
way'', because the majority can never understand and never  does  understand
the views of minorities. It never understands what  is  important  to  other
communities. Therefore the entire approach of the  ruling  party,  which  is
the majority, has always been: Come and make a contribution.  You  are  very
welcome. Come and help us make it better. But come and  give  expression  to
that by way of the majority. I do  not  want  to  argue  with  Dr  Koornhof,
because that is clearly why he is also in the ANC.

The ANC has never ... I want to ask the ANC  or  Dr  Koornhof  to  name  one
example of a community, any minority community, which has the right in  this
country to  make  a  decision  of  its  own  about  a  matter  which  is  of
fundamental   importance   to   that   community.   There   is   not    one.
[Interjections.] No, you are also trying to stop that. That you  also  tried
to stop.
Mr D V BLOEM: Orania!

Dr C P MULDER: Mr Bloem, you do not understand these things. Now I  want  to
tell you that the problem is: A minority community must have  the  right  to
be  itself.  It  cannot  simply  realise  its  full  potential  through  the
majority. I did not reach the point I wanted to reach;  and  ten  to  one  I
cannot do it.

Of course there is understanding and place for all of us  in  this  country.
But then there must be real understanding that minorities  can  reach  their
full potential. Then there is a role and a  place  for  each  one;  but  not
through the majority. The option of ...]

... ``Be reasonable, see it my way'' is no  solution  whatsoever.  It's  the
wrong option. Forget it. [Interjections.]

Mrs M A SEECO: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, as we celebrate  September
as heritage month in South Africa, we are reminded  about  our  past  as  we
plan for our future.

Despite our ugly  past  South  Africa  remains  one  of  the  most  exciting
countries in the world with its diverse cultures,  rich  natural  resources,
wildlife, unique  artworks  and  distinct  political  history.  It  is  this
reason, namely our history and our  culture,  that  is  the  cause  for  our
celebration. We are therefore challenged  to  promote  unity  in  diversity,
recognising  that  we  may  come  from  different  religions  and   cultural
backgrounds, but we are first South Africans. We are proud  to  be  Africans
on our continent. It is with this connection with our continent that we  are
truly a born-again nation. We owe it to ourselves to forge a national  unity
that is aimed at creating a nonracial society committed to  the  eradication
of poverty and inequality.

It is heartwarming to witness that South Africa's  top  corporate  companies
are now flying our national flag high on their  office  premises.  It  is  a
promising sign that almost 10 years into our democracy, the  private  sector
has taken initiative in participating at this level of embracing the  spirit
of unity. This does not suggest that they did not contribute to our  nation-
building initiative. They have, but not on the scale that we  expected  them
to.

We should also take this opportunity to remind both the public  and  private
television broadcasters that South Africa is not part of Europe. It is  part
of  Africa.  Our  children  are  constantly  exposed  to  foreign   cultural
products. Our culture is threatened by television products.  The  impression
is created that the American lifestyle is superior and  better  compared  to
our way of doing things. And this is far from the truth.

The other major challenge is that our  people  know  little  about  our  own
country's rich history. This calls for the Government to  devise  means  and
strategies which will link  our  institutions  to  work  in  a  manner  that
promotes our heritage from  manufacturing  to  education.  This  means  that
heritage programmes must promote all aspects of our lives as  being  proudly
South African. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M M RATSOMA: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. Ministers, Deputy  Ministers  and
members of  Parliament,  we  are  in  the  middle  of  a  very  special  and
significant month in our country's  history.  We  are  celebrating  Heritage
Month in recognition of our roots.

As we all know, you cannot have a future without a past. So, no  matter  how
good or bad it is, it is still our own. We must  not  lament  our  past,  we
must embrace it because it is our future guidebook. As  we  all  know,  some
bad mistakes were made subsequent to our first  democratic  election,  which
can now be rectified so that we can all see how important  our  past  is  to
us.

Deputy Speaker, please allow me to mention a  few  of  our  heroes  -  Chief
Luthuli, Oliver Tambo, Robert Sobukwe, Mahatma Gandhi, Lilian  Ngoyi,  Elias
Motswaledi, Chris Hani, Dr G  M  Naicker,  Walter  Sisulu,  Dorothy  Nyembe,
Alfred Nzo, Govan Mbeki, Steve  Tshwete  to  mention  but  a  few,  and  not
forgetting many more heroes and heroines.  Finally,  but  also  importantly,
let us not forget Sara Baartman, an icon of  South  African  history.  These
people dedicated their lives to the ANC and sacrificed their  lives  for  it
in order to better our lives, and we will not forget them. Because of  them,
we are who we are today.

These very people made it possible for us to have free and  fair  elections.
It is thanks to them that we now have a say in the running of  our  country.
It is thanks to the ANC that people are receiving services such as houses  -
estimated at more than 1,5 million people; water;  electricity  -  estimated
at more than 1,4 billion  households;  health;  and  education  without  the
racial discrimination they had to endure before.

Even in the light of our bad past,  our  Government  is  trying  to  provide
reparations to the people who were harmed during this horrific era. The  ANC
has tried to do so through the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  programme.  This
process may be taking a long time. We are trying to speed it up  so  as  not
to inconvenience the victims. These people have suffered enough.

This Heritage Day reminds us of many  things,  such  as  our  tradition  and
traditional leaders, such as King Shaka, King Sekhukhuni,  King  Moshoeshoe,
King Sobhuza, King Makhado, and so forth. We must not forget  these  people,
because they were real leaders of the past. They guided us to where  we  are
today. They showed great leadership where it was needed.  Therefore,  it  is
thanks to them  that  we  have  a  well-respected  history  on  the  African
continent.

It is thanks, also, to the culture of Africa that  we  have  been  given  Mr
Sontonga,  the  composer  of  our  famous  national  anthem  Nkosi  Sikelel'
iAfrica. It is a beautiful anthem no matter what people say. Our other  most
prized possession of a true patriotic South Africa  is  our  national  flag.
Yes, we are proud, because everywhere you  turn  you  find  T-shirts,  caps,
stickers, toys, and so forth. Having the national  emblem  on  these  things
shows that we are heading in the right direction.
The reconciliation and transformation process has brought happiness  to  our
people. Thanks to all the people who  made  this  possible.  I  say  to  the
Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, that we  recognise  the
good job you have been doing in uplifting our arts and culture.

I hope that from this day onwards we will celebrate and not moan  or  suffer
any  oppression,  and  that  there  is  no  more  racist  action  and   only
improvement in our lives. Long live Heritage  Day,  long  live!  I  dedicate
this poem to our heroes:


  Aowi lehu mohlakudi
  Lehu ke phiri le tla bosego batho ba robetse
  le a tsatsela
  Lehu ga lena pelo hlomogi
  Lehu ke moradia
  Lehu masenyeletsa o hlokile le go gaugela bagale ba rena

This poem I dedicate to Heritage Day:

Dr S E M PHEKO: Madam Deputy Speaker,  national  heritage  is  an  important
national possession. It is everything a nation has  materially,  spiritually
and morally. Heritage includes the entire  epistemology  of  a  nation:  its
culture, its language, its history, its  philosophy  of  life,  its  way  of
conducting its economic and political  affairs.  But  the  foundation  of  a
nation's heritage is land. All  over  the  world  land  is  a  critical  and
sensitive issue, because there is a connection  between  land  and  economic
power.

A nation must have land to be a nation. Nationhood is land and  sovereignty.
No people can be a sovereign nation, unless they possess land of  their  own
and control its riches. It is erroneous to claim that the problem  in  South
Africa is not landlessness, but homelessness. The fact is that no homes  can
be built in the air or in the sky. Homes are built on  the  land,  therefore
homelessness is a consequence of landlessness and land is the possession  of
the people. Land  is  national  power  and  dignity.  It  gives  its  people
national independence and freedom from economic  domination  and  servitude.
Land is the source  of  life.  Food,  water,  homes,  agriculture,  domestic
animals, mineral wealth, medicines and  all  raw  materials  come  from  the
land.

Land is the source of food and life. Without land there would  be  no  life,
no heritage. There can be no meaningful  talk  of  heritage  when  over  ten
million of our people live in unhealthy squatter camps that  are  unsuitable
for human habitation. Land  is  also  critical  in  the  creation  of  jobs,
wealth,  decent  houses  and  resources  for  education.  Too  many  African
children cannot afford education today  because  of  poverty  stemming  from
land dispossession. Let us not forget  this  important  national  asset  and
heritage on this Heritage Day.

It is unacceptable to the PAC that Africans in South Africa should let  land
for homes, farming, mining of minerals and live like the third  class  in  a
country that is endowed with so much wealth  and  a  country  that  is  four
times the size of Britain and Northern Ireland combined.  There  can  be  no
talk of heritage without land and celebration of freedom  without  equitable
distribution of land.

The foundation of a  nation's  heritage  is  land.  Celebration  of  freedom
without land repossession by the dispossessed is incomplete. Izwelethu!  [It
is our country!]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is amazing how fast  time
flies. I remember addressing the House not so long  ago  in  celebration  of
our  heritage.  Either  way,  returning  today  does   not   minimise   that
celebration, but makes it greater.  Our  greatest  heritage  marks  the  ten
years of democracy, freedom and togetherness. Thank  you  ANC  for  bringing
back our country from  total  segregation  to  one  united  rainbow  nation.
[Applause.]

Heritage - no matter where our roots have stemmed from, each and  every  one
is as much South African as the next. We are  proudly  undertaking  this  in
our  national  Constitution  that  proudly  spells  out  the  South  African
heritage,  its  composition  and   preservation.   One   of   our   greatest
accomplishments as part of our heritage is  our  national  Constitution  and
the democracy it has given birth to. But our  heritage  extends  far  beyond
our national Constitution and the people that make up South Africa. We  have
national symbols that make us unique in our  diversity  and  say  ``This  is
South Africa''.

The  many  colours  and  shapes  of  our  national  flag  all  symbolise   a
characteristic of our nation. The MF is  proud  to  have  it  hoisted  as  a
national symbol of heritage. To sing our  national  anthem  that  marks  our
past, present and future is respected from the heart. Our  national  flower,
the protea; our national tree, the real yellowwood; our national  fish;  our
national bird, the blue  crane;  the  national  animal,  the  springbok,  we
salute you and celebrate your existence in making us truly South African.

The MF celebrates the national emblems that symbolise our rich heritage  and
sees these symbols with their content of yesterday, today and tomorrow as  a
token of a transformed society, and takes the opportunity to wish all  South
Africans a very enjoyable, happy  Heritage  Day.  Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy
Speaker.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, in my boekrak by die  huis  staan  daar  'n
boek met die titel, My erfenis is vir my mooi, 'n  aanhaling  uit  Dawid  se
woorde in Psalm 16. Buite-op is die afbeelding van 'n goue kandelaar met  sy
sewe fakkels. Hierdie boek is 'n boek oor die ontstaan  en  die  geskiedenis
van die Potchefstroomse Universiteit vir Christelike Hoër  Onderwys.  Voorin
is die  universiteitslied,  die  alma  mater,  wat  begin  met  die  woorde,
``Gebore uit die nag van smaad, sien  ons  jou  staan  as  wonderdaad.''  My
erfenis is vir my mooi.

Vandag is daardie naam weg. Die kandelaar as wapen  -  net  'n  kwessie  van
tyd. Die karakter van daardie inrigting is voortdurend in die  spervuur,  en
dan vra u vir my om opgewonde te raak oor Erfenisdag, oor  die  wyse  waarop
ons erfenis in Suid-Afrika bewaar word.

Vir die meeste mense het Erfenisdag bloot geword om toeskouers  te  wees  by
'n  hengse  party  eenmaal  'n  jaar.  Gewoonlik  met  'n  slagspreuk   soos
``Celebrating our diversity''. Intussen word ons erfenis  daagliks  stukkend
getrap onder die voete van dit  wat  gewoonlik  genoem  word  transformasie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, in my book-case at home there  is  a  book
entitled My erfenis is vir my mooi [I  have  a  delightful  inheritance],  a
quotation from David's words  in  Psalm  16.  On  the  cover  there  is  the
depiction of a golden candlestick with its seven  flares.  This  book  is  a
book about the origin and the history of the Potchefstroom Universiteit  vir
Christelike Hoër Onderwys. On the front page there is the  university  song,
the alma mater, which begins with  the  words,  ``Gebore  uit  die  nag  van
smaad, sien ons jou staan as  die  wonderdaad''  [Born  from  the  night  of
content, we see you standing as a miraculous  deed].  I  have  a  delightful
inheritance.

Today that name no longer exists.  The  candlestick  as  badge  -  merely  a
question of time. The character of that  institution  is  in  the  ceaseless
cross-fire and then you ask me to become excited about Heritage  Day,  about
the way in which our heritage in South Africa is being preserved.

To most people Heritage Day has become merely being spectators  at  a  great
big party once a year. Usually with  a  slogan  such  as  ``Celebrating  our
diversity''. In the meantime our heritage is being trodden  on  daily  under
the feet of what is normally referred to as transformation.]

The moral of the story: Heritage is not about a  once-off  happening  and  a
diversity ``babelas'' [hangover.].  Heritage  is  not  about  the  President
doing some tiekiedraai waltz once in a  decade.  Heritage  is  not  about  a
museum at the outskirts of the city. It is  first  and  foremost  about  our
daily life, about our institutions, our society,  about  the  way  we  live,
about the scent of a place that is dear to us in our everyday life.  I  used
the Potchefstroom University as an example, but the list has no end.

In ons skole moes jare lange tradisies wyk, om van bo af  getransformeer  te
word.  Ons  monumente  en  standbeelde  word  bedreig  met  verskuiwing   en
verwydering. Wat plekname betref, die hele Tswane moet nou oor  Pretoria  se
naam besluit. Daar is die kwessie van 5 000 plekname wat in die Vrystaat  op
een dag op die agenda is. Hulle  het  skoonskip  gemaak  in  die  Noordelike
provinsie - behalwe die dorp wat na die duiwel vernoem is.

Ons het in 1994 geweet dinge gaan verander.  Politieke  verandering  beteken
nie net nuwe  gesigte  in  die  Uniegebou  en  die  res  van  die  land  bly
onveranderd nie. Afrikaners het in  groot  mate  daarmee  vrede  gemaak  dat
hulle in 'n tydperk van verandering leef. Benewens dit wat gesê is deur  die
geagte Koornhof, dra Afrikaners positief by tot  verandering  wat  die  lewe
van almal in die land verbeter.

Ek kan nie dink aan 'n ander gemeenskap in die wêreld wat hulle so  positief
by radikale veranderinge aangepas het nie. Ons het geweet  dat  veranderings
ook sal neerslag vind in gemeenskapstrukture en -instellings, maar  ons  het
gehoop dat dit sal geskied langs die weg  van  vennootskap  en  voortgesette
gesprek en nie langs die weg van dekreet nie. Nie by wyse  van  Big  Brother
wat besluit oor hoe elke instelling moet lyk nie.

Die NA sê vir ons mense: ``Jou toekoms is hier. Ons is  hier  om  te  bly''.
Ons sê, ``Suid-Afrika eerste''. Hierdie selfde nuwe Suid-Afrika, dis al  een
wat ons het. Maar die NA sê die voorwaarde daarvoor is die erkenning van  en
eerbied  vir  die  regte,  die  strukture  en  die   instellings   van   die
verskillende  gemeenskappe  van  hierdie  land.  Ons  sê  ook   ``unity   in
diversity'',  maar  dan  moet  die  Grondwet  toegepas  word.  Die  Regering
verstaan onder ``unity in diversity'' blykbaar iets totaal  anders  as  ons.
Vir  die  ANC  beteken  ``unity  in  diversity''  dat  elke  instelling  die
demografiese profiel van die land moet weerspieël.
Dan bly daar mos  niks  van  verskeidenheid  oor  nie,  want  dan  lyk  elke
instelling ook eenderste. Geen ``diversity'' nie. Dit faal, want  alles  lyk
dieselfde. Afrikaners wil deel wees van hierdie land. Ons  wil  voluit  deel
wees. Nie daar ver, eenkant, iewers  afgesonder  om  ons  eie  dingetjie  in
privaatheid op ons eie plekkie te doen in 'n geïsoleerde  gemeenskap  of  om
ons eie braaivleisvuurtjie nie. Ons  wil  nie  emigreer  nie.  Ons  wil  nie
eenkant toe ry om 'n beeldedorp by  die  monument  te  aanskou  van  al  die
beelde wat uit hulle plekke verwyder is nie. Ons wil deel wees  van  hierdie
land en sy ryke geskiedenis, maar nie  as  die  voortdurende  skurk  in  die
storie nie. Ons wil ook Erfenisdag vier, maar dan wil ons sê ons kinders  en
ons kleinkinders moet kan sien en beleef wat ons  bedoel  as  ons  sê,  ``My
erfenis is vir my mooi''. Hulle moet nie net eendag daarvan  in  boeke  lees
nie. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In our schools traditions of many years had to give way, to be  transformed
from the top. Our monuments and statues are under threat of replacement  and
removal. With regards to place names, the entire Tswane now  has  to  decide
about Pretoria's name. There is the question of 5 000  place  names  in  the
Free State being on the agenda on one day. Everything has  been  removed  in
the Northern Province, except the town which was named after the devil.

We knew in 1994 that things would change. Political  change  does  not  only
mean new faces in the Union  Building,  leaving  the  rest  of  the  country
unchanged. Afrikaners have to a large extent accepted  the  fact  that  they
are living in a period of change. In addition to what has been said  by  the
hon Koornhof, Afrikaners are making an active contribution  to  change  that
will improve the lives of everyone in South Afria.

I cannot think of another community in the world which  had  adapted  itself
so positively to radical changes. We knew that there would also  be  changes
in community structures and institutions, but  we  hoped  that  these  would
come about by way of partnerships and on-going debates and  not  by  way  of
decree. Not by way of Big Brother who decides how every  institution  should
look.

The NA says to our people: ``Jou toekoms is hier. Ons is hier om  te  bly.''
[Your future is here. We are here to stay.] We say,  ``Suid-Afrika  eerste''
[South Africa first]. This selfsame new South Africa  is  the  only  one  we
have. But the NA says that the condition for it is the  recognition  of  and
the respect for the rights, the  structures  and  the  institutions  of  the
various communities of this country. We also  say  ``unity  in  diversity'',
but then the Constitution must be applied. By  ``unity  in  diversity''  the
Government apparently understands something totally different from  what  we
do. To the ANC ``unity in diversity'' means that  every  institution  should
reflect the demographic profile of the country.

In  that  case  nothing  of  diversity  would  be  left,  because  then  all
institutions look the same. No ``diversity''. It fails,  because  everything
looks the same. Afrikaners want to be part of this country. We  want  to  be
totally part of it. Not somewhere far away and isolated to do our own  thing
in privacy in our own place in an isolated community or around our own  camp
fire. We do not want to emigrate. We do not want to ride  in  one  direction
to look at a town of statues at the  monument  comprising  all  the  statues
that have been removed from their  places.  We  want  to  be  part  of  this
country and its rich history, but not  as  the  proverbial  villain  in  the
piece. We, too, want to celebrate Heritage Day, but  then  we  want  to  say
that our children and our grandchildren must be able to see  and  experience
what we mean when we  say,  ``My  erfenis  is  vir  my  mooi.''  [I  have  a
delightful inheritance.] They must not only read about  that  in  books  one
day. I thank you.]]

[... I start by thanking the ANC-led Government for making it  possible  for
all South Africans to enjoy their cultures. People have different  cultures.
They all have their ways of living and things they do  at  different  times.
There are places that other people are not allowed to enter.

We differ in terms of languages. Everybody is proud  of  his  mother  tongue
because it is part of his or her culture. Culture  is  everyone's  heritage.
No one can change himself when  he  is  in  envy  of  another  nationality's
culture. Things won't go right for that person. Nowadays people are  allowed
to enter places that have been sacred  to  them  through  the  years.  These
changes were brought about by the ANC. We have sacred places  which  if  you
don't belong there, you are not allowed to enter. One  such  an  example  is
Lake Fundudzi, which is in Tshiheni. When people visit Fundudzi,  they  must
be accompanied by royal people from that place. When you reach  that  place,
as an outsider, you will be told to kneel down and  close  your  eyes  until
you are told to open them. It is then that you will  be  taken  to  see  the
lake.
We also have a small lake at Ha-Lambani and the  Makonde  cave  where  Nwali
used  to  pass.  We  also  have  hot  springs  with  hot  water,  which  are
responsible for curing bone  diseases  after  one  has  bathed  in  the  hot
springs. The former apartheid government did not allow blacks in  those  hot
springs. The truth was that those were sacred  places.  All  these  cultural
things must be preserved and upgraded because they are  our  heritage  given
to us by nature. We must make it a point that those sacred places are  taken
care of, for the sake of the next generation. Our  grandchildren  must  know
our roots.

When we are supposed to go and ask for the rain, people go out and  do  what
they are supposed to do, so that it can rain  and  they  can  plough.  Those
things must be revived because nowadays it no longer rains like it  used  to
in the past. There are  different  dances  which  they  used  to  perform  -
educational   and   entertainment   dances.   Entertainment   dances    were
tshigombela, malende and visa. Educational dances were  misevhetho,  vhusha,
mirundu and madomba. As South Africans, we are very proud of our heritage.
We  have  folklore  tales  which  our  grandparents  used  to   tell   their
grandchildren in the evenings when sitting  around  the  fire.  Folklore  is
also educational. Just like the story of Bugs Bunny and a Tortoise.  We  are
aware that Bugs Bunny had the wisdom of always leading  astray.  Bugs  Bunny
and the tortoise made an agreement that they  were  going  to  race  against
each other and there was going to be a prize. The  tortoise  took  his  wife
and placed her at the finishing point so that he  could  be  the  winner  of
that race. He knew that he could not run faster than  Bugs  Bunny.  As  they
were running different routes, they agreed  that  they  would  meet  at  the
finishing point. The race began.  When  Bugs  Bunny  arrived,  the  tortoise
said: I  arrived  before  you.  This  is  where  Bugs  Bunny  was  defeated,
irrespective of his wisdom. He was unable  to  see  that  it  was  a  female
tortoise.

All these things must be brought back and taught like before,  so  that  the
youth must not forget their  own  culture.  We  also  have  various  musical
instruments. We have tshihwana and dende, which are  specifically  for  men;
lugube is for women and girls; tshihwana is for bachelors; and we also  have
mafhuwe, which is for women when they are working.

As far as dramas are concerned, we have things like madaganana. Those  games
were played only after circumcision and when people  were  graduating.  They
were for  entertaining  people.  They  were  also  used  in  misevhetho.  On
Saturdays, in  the  afternoon,  people  used  to  go  there  and  watch  the
madaganana dancing. They never knew where the  dancers  came  from,  because
they used to watch them dancing from a distance.

Rural life is better because nowadays people are  also  free  from  slavery.
The present Government made it possible for them  to  enjoy  their  cultures
without fear of anything.  They  are  now  able  to  show  their  particular
abilities, for example, we have traditional healers like  Mr  Mushwana  from
Tzaneen. He has always used snakes to communicate with  his  ancestors.  But
now, because of the ANC-led Government, he  is  a  tourist  attraction.  The
tourists pay a R20 entrance fee and R50 to see the ancestral snake.
In rural areas they say no man is an island. They are still  doing  madavha,
for example, ploughing the fields together, gathering wood and so on. I  can
give you an example of what happened at  Ha-Davhana  in  September.  Luvhola
Cultural Village burnt down. This is a cultural  exhibition  centre.  People
agreed that with effect from 15 September, they would  all  be  involved  in
rebuilding the place and that they must finish. There are a lot  of  changes
in rural areas. They now have electricity and water.

We find that their lifestyle is now better and that people do as  they  wish
at any time. Rural people worship their ancestors. They sing all night  long
or for three days, without any disturbances. That is one of the reasons  why
rural people feel comfortable. We thank the ANC-led  Government  for  making
it possible for everybody to enjoy his culture, freely and without fear.  It
should also be possible for people to do similar things -  working  together
as one. They must not forget their roots.

Our culture is our heritage and life. I thank you. [Applause.]]
Mr S E OPPERMAN: Hon members, my theme this afternoon is  ``Celebrating  our
freedom as repairers of the bridge.''

Deputy Speaker, although the launch of the new South African  Coat  of  Arms
on 27 April 2000 with the Quena or the Khoi representation in  the  form  of
two human figures depicting an attitude of greeting  and  symbolising  unity
and with the motto, !ke e: /xarra //ke was a  powerful  declaration  and  an
acknowledgement of the indigenous peoples of our  country,  very  little  is
still known about the  Quena  people  by  the  majority  of  South  Africans
including the descendants of the Quena or Khoi on the Cape Flats and in  the
small dorpies of our country.

In his book Repairers of  the  Bridge  Vernon  Oosthuizen  reflects  on  the
prophetic destiny of the Quena people as follows:


  The biggest obstacle  to  discovering  the  Quena  identity  is  not  the
  obliteration of facts, or the distortions of the Khoi  history,  but  the
  Khoi denying and devaluating his own roots. We have denied where we  come
  from, yet looking in the mirror tells me where I  come  from.  There  may
  have been influence and European or Indian tints, but the  Khoi  base  is
  nevertheless there.

He continues by saying:


  I am not what I used to be I can never be, but I must step out of  denial
  and come home by making peace with where I come from and who I am.

Anders as wat baie historici glo, het nie net die wit  Afrikaners  'n  Groot
Trek beleef nie. Met die trek  van  1838  het  wit  Afrikaners  hulle  bande
losgemaak, en weggetrek uit die Kaapkolonie na die ruimtes waar dit oop  is,
en mens baie ver kan sien. Talle bruin Afrikaners  het  ook  'n  groot  trek
binne die land van hulle geboorte, in hulle woonbuurte, in hul huise  en  in
hulself beleef. Toe hulle die vernedering, die verguising en die  miskenning
nie langer kon verduur nie, het hulle hul sielsbande losgemaak van die  land
waarin die Quenabloed vir die eerste keer in  1488  by  Mosselbaai  aan  die
hand van die Europeërs gevloei het. Vir baie was, en is, die pyn  steeds  so
intens dat hulle nog nie huis toe gekom het nie. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Contrary to  what  many  historians  believe,  not  only  white  Afrikaners
experienced a Great Trek. With the trek of  1838  white  Afrikaners  severed
their ties, and moved out of the Cape colony to the wide expanses  where  it
is open, and where one can see a very long  way.  Many  coloured  Afrikaners
also experienced a great trek inside the country of their  birth,  in  their
townships, in their homes and in themselves. When they could not  stand  the
humiliation, the denigration and the disregard  any  longer,  they  loosened
their souls' ties from the country in which the Quena blood flowed  for  the
first time in 1488 at Mossel Bay at the hand of the Europeans. For many  the
pain was, and still is, so intense that they have not come home yet.]

So my speech this afternoon is also a home calling to  all  the  descendants
of the Quena to leave behind those shackles, to take  their  rightful  place
and, in so doing, endorse their freedom. It  is  a  pity  that  there  is  a
striking absence of any historical and  archeological  sites  attributed  to
the Quena, the Hautitou people on the historical, archeological and  tourist
routes in South Africa. Is this part of a deliberate attempt to corrupt  the
history once again?

The indigenous people owned  much  of  South  Africa,  Quenaku,  before  the
Europeans set foot on its soil in 1488. They lost it all;  recent  academics
even took away their name. They dubbed them as herders  as  opposed  to  the
hunting gathering Kung or Bushmen, implying that the  Quena  were  primitive
cattle or sheepkeepers without any linkage  with  the  civilised  Vedic  and
Biblical world  outside  the  continent.  Yet  their  country,  Quenaku,  is
littered with stonebuilt shrines, temples  and  astronomical  observatories,
built on the pattern of Indian temples which formed an integral part of  the
cosmological religion with sophisticated theology, astronomy,  geometry  and
social and religious ethics. The stone structures  of  this  culture  called
Litaku, are found in Komatiland while others litter the veld of the Karoo.
Toe Da Gama in Mosselbaai kontak met die Quenakhoi maak, was sy  kommentaar,
nadat hy die harmonie en ritme van hulle musiek gehoor het: ``Hulle  behoort
die ware God te ken''. Toe ek Vrydagmiddag, laatmiddag, 19  September  2003,
in  die  Moordenaarskaroo  tussen  die  eenvoudige  klipstrukture   van   'n
Quenatempel  en  sterrewag  staan,  het  ek  met  Da  Gama  saamgestem.  Die
afstammelinge van die Quena, met hulle ritme en harmonie in sang en  musiek,
behoort die ware God te ken.

Die tempel waarin ek was, waarskynlik gebou 500 jaar na Christus  -  dit  is
in die eerste millennium na Christus - het duidelik getoon dat hulle op  die
skepping gefokus het in hulle aanbidding. Binne die  tempel  het  ons  groep
ons vryheid gebruik om ons knieë voor die Skepper te buig. Met  die  sjofars
het ons vrylating uitgeroep, en in  die  geloof  'n  vlag  geplant  vir  die
Quena, vir ons  land,  vir  Afrika.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[When Da Gama made contact with the Quena-Khoi in Mossel  Bay,  his  comment
was, after he had heard the harmony and rhythm of their music:'' They  ought
to know the real God.'' Late Friday afternoon, 19  September  2003,  when  I
stood in the Moordenaarskaroo between  the  simple  stone  structures  of  a
Quena temple and observatory, I agreed with Da Gama. The descendants of  the
Quena, with their rhythm and harmony in song and music, ought  to  know  the
real God.

The temple in which I was, probably built 500 years after Christ - that  is,
in the first millennium after Christ - clearly showed that they  focused  on
the creation in their worshipping. Inside the  temple  our  group  used  our
freedom to bend our knees before the Creator. With the  shofars  we  shouted
out our liberation, and in the faith planted a flag for the Quena,  for  our
country, for Africa.]

That declaration was part of the building of  the  highway  from  Africa  to
Assyria, for the Assyrians to come into Africa and for the Africans to  come
into Assyria. We will be preparing the way for that day  when  Israel  shall
be the third, with Africa and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst  of  the
earth. That day will come as  the  beginning  of  the  true  renaissance  in
Africa, and the Quena descendants will play the role  as  the  repairers  of
the bridge. I so proclaim. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ARTS, CULTURE,  SCIENCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY:  Thank  you
very much, Deputy Speaker. I want to express my appreciation to the ANC  for
allowing me to participate in this very important  debate,  which  is,  more
often  than  not,  undermined;  yet,  this  debate   is   central   to   our
transformation.

I want to make a few comments on the points that were raised by some of  the
hon members here. Firstly, I will address myself to the comments  that  were
made by the hon Mulder. I think he himself does not  believe  that  what  he
said here is the truth, because I think he knows for a  fact  that  the  ANC
has an inclusive approach and the ANC is very accommodating.

I think that at times we are too humble, to the point  of  being  naive,  in
terms of asserting ourselves as the majority party. However, it  is  because
we are interested in nation-building. If we were to  conduct  research,  the
world over, there would never be a democracy in  which  the  majority  party
listens to anybody's and everybody's views. It is only the ANC that  can  do
that. [Applause.]

I think Dr Mulder misses the point that we have a responsibility to  act  in
the interests of the majority of South Africans who  voted  us  into  power.
Unfortunately, that's what democracy is all about. From his input, we  could
clearly hear or pick up that he is dearly clinging onto the past. He  really
is yearning for apartheid. However, we must tell Dr Mulder that  those  days
are gone. Apartheid will never come back. [Applause.]

I also want to make a comment on the points that  were  raised  by  the  hon
Pheko. I think we all appreciate the passion that  the  hon  Pheko  has  for
land. The majority of the people  share  that  sentiment  to  a  very  great
extent but, of course, we differ with regard to the approach of  giving  the
land back to its rightful owners. We believe that we need  to  do  it  in  a
responsible manner, we need to do it in an orderly manner and we need to  do
it in an organised manner. I also think that we are doing well,  as  far  as
rolling out that programme is concerned.

To the hon Gous, I could  not  agree  more  about  the  need  to  pass  this
heritage on to our children, but we must ensure that  what  we  pass  on  is
positive,  that  it  is  characterised  by  the  culture  of  human  rights,
equality, nonracialism and nonsexism, so that we know that when we pass  on,
we will be leaving a legacy that is good and that guarantees prosperity  for
our country.

The significance of this debate that  we  are  holding  today  serves  as  a
forerunner for the tenth anniversary of our democracy. As it's already  been
alluded to, it serves as a celebration of our cultural heritage. Perhaps  we
need to move back and respond to the following question: Why do we  have  to
celebrate our cultural heritage? To answer this question, I will refer to  a
statement that was made by Madiba on the occasion of declaring 24  September
as Heritage Day.
He said, and I quote:


  When our first democratically elected Government decided to make Heritage
  Day one of our national holidays, we did so because we knew that our rich
  cultural heritage has a profound power to help build our new nation.


  We did so, knowing that the struggles against the inequities of the  past
  are part of our national identity. They are part of our culture. We  knew
  that if, indeed, our nation has to rise like a  proverbial  phoenix  from
  the ashes of division and conflict, we had  to  acknowledge  those  whose
  selfless efforts and talents were dedicated to this goal of  a  nonracial
  democracy.

This particular statement,  in  itself,  is  inclusive  and  reconciliatory,
echoing the voice and the commitment of the ANC-led  Government  to  nation-
building. Surely, Mr Aucamp, you will agree that we have gone a long way  in
preserving heritage, especially if you look at the national anthem. Some  of
us never thought we would be able to sing Die  Stem,  but  because  we  were
committed to reconciliation, we included Die Stem in  our  national  anthem.
[Applause.]

Also, I'm sure you are not really following  world  procedures,  because  we
have what is called an apartheid museum. There was a lot  of  debate  within
the ANC. Not everybody was agreeable to the  idea  of  establishing  such  a
museum, but it is there and, in essence, it captures the very heritage  that
we have alluded to. Surely, this is a process and all of  us  must  continue
to participate to ensure that everybody is on board.

Kaloku  kwangaphambili  umbutho  we-ANC   owawukhokela   idabi   lenkululeko
wawungalwi nabemi okanye  abantu  beli  lizwe,  wawusilwa  inkqubo  yolawulo
olwalucinezele  isininzi  kweli  lizwe.  Yiyo  loo  nto  ke  ekuthe  xa  loo
rhulumente  wobandlululo  esiwa,  yakuthabatha  iintambo   zolawulo   i-ANC,
yaqalisa  ukudibanisa  isizwe  ngokomgaqo  wayo  okwimiqulu  emininzi   yalo
mbutho, uMqulu wamaLungelo (Freedom Charter) ngomnye waloo  miqulu.  Kungoko
ke namhlanje, xa sitshayelela  usuku  lwangomso  esivuyisana  ngalo  sisithi
`sinelifa esizenzele lona', sibiza wonke ubani  abe  yinxenye  yokwakha  esi
sizwe soMzantsi Afrika. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[The ANC, which led the liberation struggle since  the  beginning,  was  not
fighting against the citizens or inhabitants of this country. That  is  why,
when the apartheid regime fell, when the ANC took the reigns  of  power,  it
started by uniting the nation in accordance with its policies  expressed  in
many documents of the organisation, one of which is the Freedom Charter.  It
is on that basis that,  when  we  preliminary  rejoice  in  preparation  for
tomorrow and we say ``we have created for ourselves a legacy'', we  call  on
every individual to be part of building this nation of South Africa.]

Madiba's statement alludes to the character of our society,  a  legacy  that
the democratic state inherited: a country  fraught  with  racial  divisions,
racial conflict, cultural dominance of a minority  section  of  our  society
and an environment that surpassed the culture of the majority.
We were, indeed, a nation reeling from the effects  of  the  cultural  bomb,
the  effects  which  are  defined  by  Ngugi  wa  Thiong'o  in   his   book,
Decolonising the Mind.


  The cultural bomb ...

... he says,


  was unleashed by colonisation and  its  effect  to  alienate  a  people's
  belief in their names, in their languages, in their environment, in their
  heritage, in their unity and, ultimately, in themselves.

Hence the ANC has never separated the struggle for cultural liberation  from
the struggle for national liberation.

The theme of our  heritage  month,  which  we  launched  on  28  August,  is
celebrating our national symbols and  orders.  Why  do  we  celebrate  these
symbols and orders? Our symbols are defined in  terms  of  the  Constitution
and they are meant to promote reconciliation and  nation-building.  That  is
the message that the ANC  is  emphasising  today,  tomorrow,  yesterday  and
every  other  day.  We  are  preaching  reconciliation  and  nation-building
because we believe in it. We believe that we can only prosper if  we  are  a
united nation.

These symbols express the values on which the democratic state  is  founded.
It is founded on the values  of  human  dignity,  achievement  of  equality,
advancement of human  rights  and  freedoms,  nonracialism,  nonsexism,  the
supremacy of the Constitution, universal adult suffrage, a  national  common
voters  roll,  regular   elections,   accountability,   responsiveness   and
openness. All of these values are really foreign. They  are  only  10  years
old, and were never there before.

As we celebrate heritage month and our freedom, we reiterate  our  call  for
South Africans to unite and, together, face the challenges that confront  us
as a nation, united in our diversity. It is a message that runs through  all
our symbols. Perhaps I should take the liberty to explain the  symbolism  in
our national symbols, clarify certain points of confusion and  also  explain
how the symbolism speaks to me, what it says to you and what it says to  all
of us as South Africans.

The aim is to ensure that we all  understand  and,  ultimately  embrace  our
national symbols and orders. Perhaps, before I explain each of  these  three
symbols, I should remind the House that the process  of  deciding  on  these
symbols was inclusive and all in the spirit of building our  nation.  It  is
encouraging to see  that  South  Africans,  especially  the  majority,  have
accepted and are identifying with these symbols.

Firstly,  the  national  anthem  is  a  combination  of  two  anthems   from
previously opposing parties, Nkosi  Sikelela  and  Die  Stem.  It  has  been
modified to express  the  values  that  I  have  already  alluded  to.  More
importantly, the anthem is multilingual  and  composed  of  four  languages.
South Africans have  accepted  the  national  anthem  in  the  same  spirit,
although some still struggle to sing Die Stem because of  our  attitudes  or
our stereotypes from the past, especially towards Afrikaans, which,  at  the
time, was a language of  the  oppressor.  However,  we  are  all  making  an
attempt to embrace all those languages. That does not  come  as  a  miracle,
but it is because of the efforts and the beliefs of the ANC-led Government.

A lot of people have requested that we translate  the  anthem  into  various
languages. We express our appreciation for this request and this  sentiment,
because we see it as an  indication  of  positiveness  that  strives  for  a
vision on the part of  South  Africans  to  make  ours  a  workable  nation.
[Interjections.] It's disturbing me.

We are researching international practices regarding the translation of  the
national  anthem,  but  what  the  department  is  working  on  is  a  brief
explanation of the lyrics  of  our  national  anthem,  so  that  people  can
understand what the meaning and the message contained in those lyrics is.

At this point, I want to pay tribute to Amabhokobhoko,  our  national  rugby
team, for going the extra mile in learning how to sing the national  anthem,
thanks to the efforts of the late Mrs Mxhadana who taught them.

Regarding the flag, the emphasis of the flag is the symbolism  of  the  many
colours that appear on it. These very different colours  are  designed  from
divergence to convergence, because if you look at the flag, in  the  middle,
it tapers into a ``V''. It moves from a wider design to a  tapering  design,
which forms a ``V'' in the  middle.  What  the  emphasised  message  in  the
design says is that we are united  in  our  diversity,  which  is  the  same
message as the one contained in the  coat  of  arms:  united  in  diversity.
These are gazetted as a position of the Government and that of the state.

I'm not going to say anything  about  the  coat  of  arms  because  the  hon
Ngubane dealt with that very adequately, except to say  that  the  provinces
have, by definition, their own coat of arms. The coat of arms for  provinces
are not necessarily replacing or competing with the national  coat  of  arms
as national symbols, but the actual use is only for branding  and  marketing
the respective provinces.

However, there is already a misinterpretation that the  provincial  coat  of
arms reflect a federal system of governance. Let us be  reminded  that  this
is a wrong interpretation of our provincial coat of  arms  and  that,  as  a
department,  we  have  started  discussions  and  we  are  looking  at   the
implications of this perception. We hope that people will be  watching  this
debate and will participate in it.

The history of the people of South Africa is fundamental to the  process  of
restoring our heritage and  consolidating  our  freedom.  It  constitutes  a
wealth that needs to be recorded, lest we lose the basis  of  our  identity.
The history that the hon Mr Opperman has  alluded  to  and  the  process  of
recognising and honouring significant role-players in our  history  has  not
been closed. We look forward to all contributions from all members.

The legacy projects that  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology has been mandated to  embark  on  are  also  another  vehicle  of
restoring and reconstructing our historical heritage, our human dignity  and
our freedom. The department has, to date, delivered six of the  nine  legacy
projects that were approved by Cabinet.

We will yet roll out another legacy project of significance to the  majority
of South Africans, and this is scheduled for March next year.  That  is  the
Chief Albert Luthuli Centenary Commemoration Project. While  we  write  this
history, the participation of all the people of South Africa  is  necessary,
especially of those in the rural areas, as they hold a wealth of  intangible
heritage, which is oral history.

The challenge for all of us is that we who are knowledgeable about our  real
history do not have formal  education  in  the  traditional  western  sense.
Therefore, the promotion of  multilingualism,  which  is  the  core  of  our
language policy, becomes critically important.

Lastly, I was invited to appear on a television programme that seeks to  get
South Africa talking, Asikhulume. Xolani Gwala, the host, was  presenting  a
talk show on the Proudly South African campaign and was examining the  level
of patriotism. I was most encouraged to hear  that  89%  of  the  people  of
South Africa voted as being proud to  be  South  Africans,  against  11%  of
people who had reasons not to be proud. This  is  an  overwhelming  majority
and a clear vote of confidence in the Government of  the  day,  the  ANC-led
Government. [Applause.]

I just want to say that in spite of your ...  [Interjections.]  Whatever  it
is that you are saying, hon ... I don't know what your name is ... Yes.

I just want to say that, in spite of the fact that we have a  day  dedicated
to celebrating our cultural heritage, we need and we  must  treat  each  day
and every day as cultural heritage day, where we  will,  every  day  of  our
lives,  work  towards  embracing  each   other,   work   towards   achieving
reconciliation, because it is only when we have achieved these that  we  can
direct our energies towards the  economic  development  of  our  country.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

  of clause 9.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, will  you  please  put  the
question, and I will proceed from there. [Interjections.]

discussed and only brought to the House  precisely  on  the  basis  of  them
having been agreed to. Now, I would like to know, in this  particular  case,
whether the objection is, in factÿ ...

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Sorry, Madam Deputy Speaker, I'd  like  to
withdraw my objection.

Mr L J MODISENYANE: Thanks.

Agreed to.

The House adjourned at 16:33.

National Assembly:

Papers:

1.    The Speaker:


     Ninth Report of the Working Group on the African Union:


     Following its Eighth Report, which was published on 8  September  2003,
     the Working Group would like to report as follows:


     1.     Draft Rules for the Pan African Parliament (PAP)
        During 2002, the Working Group commissioned research on draft rules
         for the PAP with  a  view  to  submitting  recommendations  to  the
         African Union Commission through the PAP  Steering  Committee.  The
         research report was submitted to  the  Working  Group  in  February
         2003. During August 2003, the  Speaker,  in  her  capacity  as  the
         Chairperson of the Steering  Committee,  also  received  a  set  of
         draft rules of procedure for submission to the  Steering  Committee
         from the Deputy Clerk of the Kenyan National Assembly.


        On 9 September 2003, the Working Group established a Task  Team  on
         the Rules of the PAP to consider priority areas on which  rules  of
         procedure for the  Inaugural  Session  of  the  PAP  needed  to  be
         formulated;  to  identify  rules  of  procedure  for  the   general
         functioning of the PAP and to conduct  a  comparative  analysis  of
         the draft rules emanating from  the  commissioned  research,  those
         drafted by the Deputy Clerk of the  Kenyan  National  Assembly  and
         rules of procedure of other regional Parliamentary bodies.


        The Working Group identified the  following  issues  for  immediate
         consideration by the Task  Team:  (i)  Oath  of  office  or  solemn
         declaration; (ii) Election  of  office  Bearers;  (iii)  Rules  for
         decision-making; (iv) Rules of Debate; (v) Regional  caucuses;  and
         (vi) Committees.


        The  Task  Team  met  on  18  September  2003  and  its  views  are
         incorporated in this  report  which,  inter  alia,  contains  broad
         principles around the Rules of Procedure.


         (1)     Oath of office or solemn declaration
              Article 13 of the PAP Protocol provides  that  at  its  first
              sitting, after election and before proceeding with  any  other
              matter, the Pan African Parliamentarians shall take an oath or
              make a solemn  declaration  which  shall  be  set  out  as  an
              addendum to this Protocol.


              Various options in respect of who would administer  the  oath
              could be considered, amongst which would be the Chairperson of
              the  Assembly  of  the  AU  or  the  Chairperson  of  the   AU
              Commission. The Working Group recommends that the  Chairperson
              of the Assembly administers the initial taking of the oath  or
              making of a solemn declaration, as the inauguration would be a
              continental ceremony. However, a Rule  must  provide  for  the
              administering of  the  oath  or  declaration  thereafter  with
              regard to new members as it would be a continuous process. The
              swearing-in process does not require a Rule.  The  manner  for
              conducting the  swearing-in  would  be  a  logistical  matter.
              Members could be called up in groups of five or ten,  with  an
              acknowledgement of the countries from which they come.


         (2)     Election of Office Bearers
              Article 12(2) of the Protocol provides that the  Pan  African
              Parliament shall elect, at its  first  sitting  following  its
              election, by secret ballot, from  among  its  members  and  in
              accordance with its Rules of Procedure, a President  and  four
              (4) Vice Presidents representing  the  Regions  of  Africa  as
              determined by the OAU. The election shall, in each case, be by
              simple majority of the members present and voting.


              The Working Group expressed the view that the  AU  Commission
              could facilitate the administration of the election of  Office
              Bearers.


              (a) Procedures of Nominating
                  The Working Group recommends that the Steering  Committee
                  should, once sufficient ratifications are  deposited  with
                  the  AU,  request  regions  to  start   the   process   of
                  nominating candidates for both  the  Presidency  and  Vice
                  Presidency of the PAP.


                  The AU Commission would be the suitable central  body  to
                  monitor  nominations  by  regions.   There   was   general
                  consensus  on  the  need   for   time   limits   regarding
                  submission of nominations, as ballot papers would have  to
                  be prepared timeously.  However,  time  limits  should  be
                  flexible to allow for the  smooth  running  of  democratic
                  processes within regions. It would be important to  record
                  on the nomination  form  whether  the  candidate  accepted
                  his/her  nomination.  Consideration  should  be  given  to
                  whether  there  should  be  a  fixed  number  of   persons
                  supporting the nomination of a candidate.


                  The Working Group felt that the Steering Committee should
                  not  be  prescriptive  in  regard  to  regions  concerning
                  procedures for nominations, but it  may  wish  to  provide
                  guidelines as regards the process and timeframes.


                  The Rules should also provide for  a  situation  where  a
                  region was unable to forward  a  nomination.  The  Working
                  Group, however, felt that in the  absence  of  a  regional
                  nomination,  other  regions  should  be   free   to   make
                  nominations from the defaulting region.


                  Parliament would need guidance  from  the  Department  of
                  Foreign Affairs as to what the position was as  regards  a
                  host country wishing to  nominate  a  candidate  or  being
                  nominated by another country.


              (b) Method of Voting
                  Rules would need to be formulated on the following:
                  (i)   Ballot  for  election   of   President   and   Vice
                         Presidents;
                  (ii) Results of Voting;
                  (iii)     Reporting of Results;
                  (iv) Procedure if there is no successful candidate; and
                  (v)  Taking of Chair by President.


                 Consideration should be given to  a  situation  that  could
                  arise should there  be  a  query  regarding  the  election
                  results. The Working Group felt that there might not be  a
                  need for a specific Rule covering this aspect.


         (3)     Rules for decision making
              According to Article 12 (11) of the Protocol, the quorum  for
              a meeting of the Pan African Parliament shall  be  constituted
              by a simple majority. Article 12 (12)  states  that  each  Pan
              African Parliamentarian shall have one vote.  Decisions  shall
              be made by  consensus  or,  failing  which,  by  a  two-thirds
              majority of all  the  Members  present  and  voting.  However,
              procedural matters, including the question of whether a matter
              is one of procedure or not,  shall  be  decided  by  a  simple
              majority  of  those  present  and  voting,  unless   otherwise
              stipulated in the Rules of Procedure. In the event of an equal
              number of votes, the person presiding  shall  have  a  casting
              vote.


              Voting Procedure
              Apart from the election of Office Bearers of  the  Parliament
              for  which  an  election  procedure  was  prescribed  in   the
              Protocol, a situation might arise which would require  certain
              decisions to be taken during the first session, e.g.  adoption
              of rules of procedure.
              In this regard, Rules would need to be  formulated  on  areas
              such as (i) Declaration of Vote; (ii) the Manner of Voting  on
              Specific Questions; and (iii) What happens should there not be
              consensus.


         (4)     Rules Of Debate
              Rules should also be formulated on the following:(i)  Address
              of Chair by Members;  (ii)  Calling  of  Members;  (iii)  Time
              Limits for Speeches; (iv) Reference to  Member  by  name;  (v)
              Offensive  Language;   (vi)Explanations;   (vii)   Points   of
              Order/Interruption of Debates and Speeches; (viii)  Rights  of
              Members to Speak/Freedom of speech; (ix)  Closure  of  Debate;
              (x) Scope of Debate; (xi) Conduct of  Members  during  Debate;
              (xii) Role of President in  Debate;  and  (xiii)  Disciplinary
              measures.


         (5)     Regional caucuses
              Article 18  of  the  Protocol  states  that  the  Pan-African
              Parliament  shall  work  in  close   co-operation   with   the
              Parliaments of  the  Regional  Economic  Communities  and  the
              National Parliaments or other deliberative  organs  of  Member
              States. To this effect, the Pan  African  Parliament  may,  in
              accordance  with  its  Rules  of  Procedure,  convene   annual
              consultative  meetings  fora  with  the  Parliaments  of   the
              Regional Economic Communities and the National Parliaments  or
              other  deliberative  organs  to  discuss  matters  of   common
              interest.


              Regions  would  play  a  vital  role  in  the   Pan   African
              Parliament. The Working Group was of the view that it was  not
              necessary to formulate a Rule  detailing  the  functioning  of
              regional caucuses within the PAP. However, there ought  to  be
              an arrangement for  regional  caucuses  to  meet  and  discuss
              issues, inter  alia,  with  a  view  to  formulating  regional
              positions on specific matters.


         (6)     Committees
              Article 12(13) of the Protocol provides that the Pan  African
              Parliament may establish such committees as it deems  fit  for
              the proper discharge of its functions and in  accordance  with
              its Rules of Procedure.


              The Working Group felt that  particular  in-house  committees
              would need to be established during the first session  of  the
              PAP to facilitate the smooth running of the institution. These
              committees could deal with issues such as
                    i) Rules of the PAP;
                   ii) the budget; and
                  iii)  programming  of  business.  The  Working  Group  has
                       requested the  Task  Team  to  consider  further  the
                       specific functions of the proposed committees.


              Rules would therefore be necessary to  provide  for  the  (i)
              types of PAP committees  ("In-house"  and  "Portfolio");  (ii)
              Composition; (iii) Terms of Reference; (iv) Terms  of  Office;
              (v) Quorums;  (vi)  Decision-making;  (vii)  Meetings;  (viii)
              Reporting (ix) Powers and Functions; and  (x)  Publication  or
              Disclosure of Proceedings, Evidence, Reports, etc.


              A political management structure should be in place after the
              election of the Bureau to ensure that  the  necessary  support
              was given to the new institution. It would be  vital  for  the
              Commission to give consideration to this question.


         (7)     Appointment of staff
              The process of appointment of the Clerk and Deputy  Clerk  of
              the PAP would need to be discussed at the  Inaugural  Session.
              It was noted that as per the Protocol, the  staff  of  the  AU
              Commission would support the Bureau until such time as the PAP
              staff were appointed.


         (8)     Languages
              Article 25 of the  Constitutive  Act  of  the  African  Union
              states that the working languages of the  Union  and  all  its
              institutions shall be, if possible, African languages, Arabic,
              English, French and Portuguese.


              Consideration should be given to the use at the PAP of  Sign-
              Language and Braille.


     2.     Fourth Seminar on the African Union
        In its Eighth Report, the Working Group recommended that a
           seminar be held before the end of the 2003 Parliamentary
           session. To this end, the Working Group has agreed on the
           following key objectives for the Seminar:


           (i)   To enhance the understanding of the Pan African Parliament
                  amongst Members of the South African Parliament;
           (ii)  To foster institutional engagement on  the  African  Union
                  with particular reference to the Pan African  Parliament;
                  and
           (iii) To empower Members  to  have  ongoing  dialogue  with  the
                  people of South Africa and  embark  on  public  awareness
                  activities with respect to the Pan African Parliament.


         The Working Group recommends that the Seminar be scheduled  for  20
         October 2003. Further, consideration should be  given  to  inviting
         certain individuals to  participate  in  the  Seminar  as  resource
         people.


     Report to be considered.

2.    The Speaker:


     Correspondence from The Presidency dated 10 September 2003 addressed to
     the Speaker of the National Assembly for the filling  of  vacancies  in
     the Public Service Commission:


         Madame Speaker,


         Public  Service  Commission:  Filling  of  current  and   impending
         vacancies


         Five commissioners on the Public Service Commission  are  appointed
         by the President in terms of section 196(7)(a) of the  Constitution
         of the Republic of  South  Africa,  1996  (Act  No  108  of  1996),
         following the approval of the  National  Assembly  after  a  public
         notice process and a recommendation by a committee of the  National
         Assembly (herein referred to as national commissioners).


         The terms of office of two national commissioners Mr J H  Erntstzen
         (Deputy Chairperson) and Dr E G Bain will  expire  on  31  December
         2003 and the term of office of  Prof  S  S  Sangweni  (Chairperson)
         will expire on  30  June  2004.  Currently  there  also  exist  two
         vacancies  in  the   Public   Service   Commission   for   national
         commissioners.


         In terms of section 4(1) of  the  Public  Service  Commission  Act,
         1997 (Act No 46 of 1997),  I  hereby  request  that  five  fit  and
         proper  persons,  as  contemplated  in  section  196(10)   of   the
         Constitution, be approved as soon as  may  be  practicable  by  the
         National Assembly in  accordance  with  section  196(8)(a)  of  the
         Constitution to enable the filling of -


         (a)     the two current vacancies for national commissioners;
         (b)     with effect from 1 January  2004,  the  two  vacancies  for
              national commissioners, which will  arise  when  the  term  of
              office of commissioners, Mr J H Erntstzen (Deputy Chairperson)
              and Dr E G Bain expires on 31 December 2003;
         (c)     with effect from 1 July 2004, the vacancy  for  a  national
              commissioner, which will arise when  the  term  of  office  of
              commissioner, Prof S S Sangweni (Chairperson), expires  on  30
              June 2004.


         In view of the likely limited sittings  in  2004  of  the  National
         Assembly and the  2004  elections,  it  seems  advisable  that  the
         process in the  National  Assembly  regarding  the  above-mentioned
         vacancies be finalised before the end  of  the  2003  Parliamentary
         session. I request that the names of the persons  approved  by  the
         National Assembly be forwarded to me by the end of November 2003.


         If further information or assistance is required from the  national
         executive in this regard,  please  contact  the  Minister  for  the
         Public Service and Administration, Ms G J Fraser-Moleketi.


         Yours faithfully


         THABO MBEKI


     Referred to Portfolio Committee on Public  Service  and  Administration
     for consideration and report.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

CREDA INSERT PAGES 1157-1173 - Insert ATK2309e

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs  on  Petition  of
     Royal Swazi Families, dated 17 September 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Foreign  Affairs,  having  considered  a
         Petition of the Royal Swazi Families  (Bantfwabenkhosi)  and  Swazi
         Chiefs/Nation presiding in Traditional  Swazi  Areas,  praying  for
         Parliament to urge and encourage the South  African  Government  to
         expedite the final determination of a border issue, is of the  view
         that it has no locus standi or authority  to  consider  the  issues
         raised by the petitioners.


         The  Committee  wishes  also  to  draw  attention  the  1964  Cairo
         Resolution, adopted by the Organisation of  African  Unity's  Heads
         of State and Government meeting of that year. It is the opinion  of
         the Committee that it would be  preferable  for  the  Executive  to
         honour the letter and spirit of that resolution.


         The Committee is further of the view that any consideration of  the
         issues raised in the Petition must be preceded by  transparent  and
         full consultation of  all  South  African  citizens  likely  to  be
         affected by it. While the Committee recognises  the  constitutional
         standing of traditional  authorities,  including  the  Swazi  Royal
         Families, it recognises also  that  the  constitutional  rights  to
         citizenship of South African citizens of Swazi ethnic  origin  take
         precedence.


         In view of the above the Committee recommends that the  petitioners
         be referred to the Executive, which has both the authority and  the
         power to respond to the issues raised in the petition.


     Report to be considered.
