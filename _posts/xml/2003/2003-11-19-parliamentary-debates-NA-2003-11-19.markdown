                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE  OPPOSITION:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  hereby  give
notice that I shall move on behalf of the DP:


  That the House -
  (1) notes that despite the pressing needs highlighted by National  Police
       Commissioner  Jackie  Selebi  recently  at  a   police   intelligence
       gathering, and the fact that the  National  Intelligence  Agency,  or
       NIA, is tasked with co-operating with SAPS intelligence, the Ministry
       of Intelligence appears to be spending a substantial amount of  money
       on noncore functions, such as advertising and public  relations,  and
       on a VIP guesthouse in Cape Town, valued at about R6,5 million;


  (2) notes that the hon  Minister  refuses  to  answer  questions  on  her
       department's   expenditure   on   these    items,    hiding    behind
       confidentiality requirements, despite the fact that  the  information
       requested has absolutely no bearing on national security;


  (3) therefore resolves to appeal to the  Speaker  to  intercede  in  this
       matter  and  insist  that  the  hon  Minister  answers  parliamentary
       questions properly, reprimand the Minister for  trying  to  invoke  a
       blanket amnesty on answering parliamentary questions on the misguided
       basis that all expenditure on her Ministry, even on  advertising  and
       on free condoms, is  a  matter  of  national  security,  and  to  ask
       Parliament's Joint Standing Committee  on  Intelligence  to  draw  up
       guidelines to strike a reasonable balance between  national  security
       on the one hand and transparency and accountability on the other.

                      TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

Mr R D PIETERSE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  please  allow  me  to  thank  the
outgoing board of the SABC, particularly the chairperson, Dr ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!  Hon  member,  apparently  we  are  not  on  that
particular issue. In fact, we have no list of speakers  on  this  particular
Order, and therefore we will ask the secretary to read  the  Bill  a  second
time. Just take your seat for now.
There was no debate.

Bill read a second time.

       CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR APPOINTMENT TO SABC BOARD

Mr R D PIETERSE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  please  allow  me  to  thank  the
outgoing Board  of  the  SABC,  particularly  the  chairperson,  Dr  Vincent
Maphai, and the deputy chairperson, Dr Barbara  Masekela,  on  the  sterling
work and leadership they have given to the board.

The SABC Board has  a  particular  mandate  and  thus  needs  people,  as  a
collective, to execute that mandate.  Therefore  the  list  of  12  esteemed
nominees, as a  collective,  does  subscribe  to  the  said  mandate.  As  a
committee, we arrived at the conclusion that the process was credible,  fair
and transparent.

I do understand that hon members want to  play  politics  every  opportunity
they get, as we are in the election campaign stage. But I want to appeal  to
those that are opposing this collective list to grow up and to  accept  that
the people have spoken. [Interjections.]

The opposition must stop acting as spokespersons  for  those  that  did  not
make the final 12. They never appointed you to talk  on  their  behalf  and,
best of all, you are embarrassing them.

Afrikaans,  pragtige  Afrikaans,  moedertaal  van  baie  van  ons  oor   die
kleurgrens heen, maar wat ook spanning tussen ons bring - ons wat  Afrikaans
baie keer met politiek bevooroordeel en bemors. Menige van ons  wil  voorgee
dat Afrikaans aan hulle behoort, dat net hulle namens  Afrikaans  mag  praat
en dat Afrikaans net  met  'n  sekere  aksent  en  klem  gepraat  mag  word.
Afrikaans is nie meer eksklusief die taal van die  onderdrukkers  nie,  maar
hy het sy regmatige plek as 'n ware Afrikataal ingeneem.

En waar hoor ons 'n mooier Afrikaans as uit die volksmond  van  dié  op  die
Kaapse Vlakte wanneer hulle sê: "Dit is duidelik",  "dis  'n  ANC  ding"  en
"die DA se ding is wim". Waar hoor 'n mens 'n mooier Afrikaans as dit?

'n AGB LID: Op die DA se wa!

Mnr R D  PIETERSE:  Of  selfs  as  hulle  mooier  praat,  wie  praat  mooier
Afrikaans as die Namakwalanders? En  dan  sê  die  mense  -  party  van  die
politieke partye sê dan - ons praat namens Afrikaans en die Afrikaners.

Wanneer ek na die voorgestelde lede  kyk,  soos  byvoorbeeld  agb  Lagadien,
Swartz en Maralack, dan weet ek die taal Afrikaans is  beslis  veilig.  Maar
ons kan nie oor Afrikaans praat sonder om na die aspirasies  van  die  ander
tale te kyk nie. Wat van isiXhosa? Wat van isiZulu? Wat van  Sesotho?  Hulle
is nog altyd die benadeeldes vandag.

Afrikaanssprekendes moet dieselfde warmte en  liefde,  dieselfde  beskerming
en uitbreiding toon ten opsigte van ander tale  as  wanneer  ons  praat  oor
Afrikaans. Ons moet ook seker maak dat daar kontinuïteit is om  te  verseker
dat die goeie werk wat begin is deur die  uitgaande  raad,  voortgesit  word
sonder enige haakplek. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Afrikaans, beautiful Afrikaans, mother tongue of  many  of  us  across  the
colour bar, but it also creates tension among us -  we  who  so  many  times
soil Afrikaans with  political  bias.  Many  of  us  want  to  profess  that
Afrikaans belongs to them, that only they may speak on behalf  of  Afrikaans
and that Afrikaans may only be spoken with a certain  accent  and  emphasis.
No longer does Afrikaans belong exclusively to the  oppressor,  but  it  has
claimed its rightful place as a true African language.

And where do you here a sweeter  Afrikaans  than  from  the  mouths  of  the
people on the Cape Flats when  they  exclaim:  "Dit  is  duidelik!"  [It  is
fine!], "dis 'n ANC-ding" [it is an ANC thing] en "die DA se  ding  is  wim"
[the DA is finished]. Where do you hear an  Afrikaans  more  beautiful  than
this?

An HON MEMBER: Op die DA se wa! [On the DA's wagon!]
Mr R D PIETERSE: Or even when they use a more poetic language, who speaks  a
sweeter Afrikaans than the Namaqualanders? And then people  say  -  some  of
the political parties say - we talk on behalf of Afrikaans and Afrikaners.

When I look at the  proposed  members  like,  for  instance,  hon  Lagadien,
Swartz and Maralack, then I know  that  the  Afrikaans  language  is  indeed
safe. But we cannot talk about Afrikaans without looking at the  aspirations
of the other languages. What about isiXhosa? What about isiZulu? What  about
Sesotho? Even today, they are still the disadvantaged ones.

Speakers of Afrikaans should  show  the  same  warmth  and  love,  the  same
protection and expansion in respect of other  languages  as  when  we  speak
about Afrikaans. We must also ensure that  there  is  continuity  to  ensure
that the good work initiated by the outgoing council continues  without  any
hitches.]

This includes, amongst  others,  the  question  of  transformation  and  the
regional stations' language and convergence.  We  won't  demotivate  anybody
who did not make the list. We will surely not bad-mouth those  people.  They
- the nominees - are all people of integrity, quality  South  Africans  and,
as a collective, are best suited to ensure that the new board  of  the  SABC
hits the ground running.

I want to put it to the House that, in fact, all those that were  nominated,
but particularly those who  were  short-listed,  are  outstanding  people  -
people of quality; people of integrity. But like everything else  we  do  in
life, there were only 12  positions  and  we  could  only  pick  12  people.
[Interjections.] Nobody has lost, but the SABC has gained 12  quality  board
members.

Laastens, Afrikaans, soos enige ander taal, behoort nie aan enige  party  of
aan enige groep nie, maar behoort aan dié wat dit praat, lief  is  daarvoor,
dit beskerm, dit verdedig en dit  wil  uitbrei.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Lastly, Afrikaans like any other language, does not belong to any party  or
any group, but belongs to those who speak, love, protect,  defend  and  want
to expand it.]

Hon members, the ANC governs this country, because the  people  so  decided.
The ANC lives and the ANC leads, and will continue to  do  so,  because  the
people want the ANC to lead them to a better life. Therefore,  hon  members,
as part of that responsibility the ANC  proposes  the  adoption  of  the  12
nominees, the list of whom is in front of you. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: Madam, the SABC Board being voted in today will  be  run  by  no
more than four people: ANC confidante Mr Eddie Funde will take  charge,  and
perhaps resume the teamwork that he and Ms Nomboniso  Gasa  carried  out  at
the turbulent old SA Telecommunications Regulatory Authority,  Satra,  which
was torn apart by the Cell C soap opera; Miss Christine Qunta and  Mr  Thami
Mazwai will take on content. Their track record over  the  past  five  years
constitutes what, taken  together,  you  might  describe  as  an  Africanist
assault on free speech  and  journalistic  independence.  Their  appointment
bodes very ill for the public broadcaster.

Four of the names have our support. They are: Messrs  Swartz  and  Trikamjee
for continuity - but where are Ruth Teer-Tomaselli  and  Frits  Kok  -  Miss
Lagadien to serve disability in general, but especially the 4 million  South
Africans who are hard of hearing, and Alison Gilwald,  for  across-the-board
expertise. She too is a veteran of Satra, but she did not star in  the  Cell
C soap opera. She will not achieve much on her own, we fear.

The remaining four are seat-fillers, keeping better people out. Miss  Mkonza
deals with small media for the MDDA - the mega  media  are  not  her  field.
Cecil  Msomi  said  the  right  things,  but  enquiries  failed  to  illicit
enthusiasm. Mr Mbeki is young and nothing else.  Does  the  ANC  -  panicked
about the political demobilisation of the youth - really think  that  either
he or a youth channel pumped full of politics will make any difference?

Lastly, Mr Maralack is quite simply a mystery. To think, hon  members,  that
we could have had  Pinky  Moholi.  You  should  be  ashamed  of  yourselves.
[Interjections.]  The  SABC  must  meet   the   commercial   challenges   of
technological convergence soon, and it needs her combination of  engineering
and business judgment. She is brilliant, but brilliance is not what the  ANC
is looking for, especially when it is accompanied by the  rejection  of  all
qualifications to free speech.

The ANC was fully as impressed as I was with  Pinky's  interview.  The  only
explanation for the hon members' uncharacteristically zipped  lips  as  they
sat huddled in a corner of the committee room,  when  they  tabled  the  ANC
list on Friday, is that they were under orders. It is the  only  conceivable
explanation. [Interjections.]

The committee was supposed to finalise the board on 25 September. Now,  some
informal  discussion  about  the  short-listed  candidates  did  take  place
between the parties at that time, after 27 hours of interviews and  airfares
paid by the taxpayer. We, therefore, do have some impression - we  do  -  of
what the outcome might have been had MPs been free  to  apply  their  minds.
But, even then they showed signs of constraint and  then  that  meeting  was
cancelled.

Now, we are supposed to observe here the separation  of  powers.  We  are  a
powerful arm of state. We represent the people, not the parties, and  it  is
not - to the hon Randy Pieterse - the people who  have  spoken  here.  Above
all, the executive cannot  select  the  independent  bodies  because  it  is
precisely the executive they are supposed to be independent from.

This arm of state was very firmly twisted  behind  its  own  back  with  the
appointment of this board, I believe. [Interjections.]  No,  I  can't  prove
it. If I could, the process would be arguably unlawful.

This is why there were no negotiations this time,  no  discussions  -  which
might have revealed too much. Lastly, a wounded New NP protested that  there
had in fact been discussions between the black  and  the  white  nationalist
parties, and where was the product of the deal?

Die Nuwe NP soek bywonerstatus vir homself op die ANC se  plaas.  Hy  beskik
oor geen mandaat om in die naam van Afrikaans  te  onderhandel  nie,  en  ek
sluit my aan by wat Randy gesê het oor die onderwerp.

Ons sou graag wou weet watter name aan ANC-kant die Nuwe NP  bereid  was  om
te  aanvaar  in  ruil  vir  'n  bywonerboer  op  'n   Afrikanistiese   raad.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Watter prys sou hy betaal vir 'n  bietjie  skynwins?  Maar
op die ou end sit hy maar weer met  niks,  nè?  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The New NP is looking for tenant status for itself on the  ANC's  farm.  It
does not have the mandate to negotiate on behalf of Afrikaans, and I  concur
with what Randy has said about the subject.

We would like to know which names, on the side of the ANC, the  New  NP  was
prepared to accept in exchange for a tenant farmer on  an  African  council.
[Interjections.] What price would it pay for a little false benefit? But  in
the end it is yet again left with nothing, not so? [Applause.]]

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Deputy Speaker, while it is  I  who  stands  at  this
podium and my voice that you hear, the  words  I  use  and  the  ideas  they
express are those of the  IFP's  full  member  of  communications,  the  hon
Suzanne Vos. She is unfortunately not able to be  with  us  this  afternoon.
She had paid full and thorough attention to the selection of the SABC  Board
and saw considerable promise among the first 28  persons  that  were  listed
for selection. But the warnings contained in her response and  that  of  the
IFP  to  the  new  board  bode  ill  for  the  future  of  independence  and
transparency in the public broadcaster. This is Ms  Vos's  response  to  the
new SABC Board, and I quote:


  The Inkatha Freedom Party opposes this SABC Board nomination list. We see
  it as an attempt by the ANC majority to exert political control over  the
  SABC. And we know  why.  The  forthcoming  convergence  legislation  will
  completely rewrite broadcasting and telecommunications laws, and the  ANC
  wants a compliant and complacent SABC Board sitting on its  hands,  while
  it turns the SABC from a public broadcaster back  to  an  apartheid-style
  state broadcaster. And of course, we have an election around the corner.


  Unlike the present board,  under  the  excellent  chairpersonship  of  Dr
  Vincent Maphai, we cannot envisage this proposed  collective  challenging
  the Minister's already stated intention to control the editorial policies
  of the SABC. There can be no doubt in our minds that the vast majority of
  persons chosen by the majority party to be put forward in this House, and
  then to the President for appointment are biased  towards  the  ANC.  The
  names that we have before us today are stacked with people who have  long
  enjoyed the political patronage of the ANC and its allies. Some have been
  recycled from one  Government  appointment  to  another,  fulfilling  ANC
  directives. Others have  enjoyed  the  largess  of  lucrative  state  and
  parastatal contracts.
  On the whole, these nominees do not possess the range of skills  required
  by law for appointment to the board. This is a historic day.

Says Ms Vos.


  Mark this date as the day when the SABC finally  and  publicly  lost  its
  independence.

Well, we must all sincerely hope that the board  rises  above  these  dismal
expectations. I thank you.

Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Agb Voorsitter, mag ek net vir die  agb  Dene  Smuts  sê,
die Nuwe NP is nie 'n bywoner op iemand se plaas nie.  Volgens  die  jongste
meningspeilings, wat aantoon dat die  Nuwe  NP  fenomenaal  groei,  is  daar
duisende derduisende Afrikaanssprekendes wat die Nuwe NP ondersteun  en  dis
namens  hulle  wat  ons  hier  praat.  [Tussenwerpsels.]   (Translation   of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS: Hon Chairperson, may I just  tell  the  hon  Dene  Smuts
that the New NP is not a sharecropper on someone's farm.  According  to  the
latest  opinion  polls,  which  indicate  that  the  New   NP   is   growing
phenomenally, there  are  thousands  upon  thousands  of  Afrikaans-speaking
people who support  the  New  NP  and  we  are  speaking  on  their  behalf.
[Interjections.]]

The outgoing board of  the  SA  Broadcasting  Corporation,  under  the  able
chairmanship of  Dr  Vincent  Maphai,  did  excellent  work  and  should  be
congratulated on a job well done. Unfortunately, the New NP  cannot  support
the new list of SABC Board members to be  approved  by  the  hon  President.
Although the names of excellent candidates appear  on  the  list,  the  list
does not meet  the  requirements  of  the  Broadcasting  Act  of  1999.  The
preamble to the aforesaid Act speaks of the diverse nature of  South  Africa
and about the fact that the broadcasting system is  controlled  and  managed
by persons or groups of persons from a diverse  range  of  communities,  and
must reflect the multilingual and diverse nature of South Africa.

Section 13(4)(b) of the Act  further  requires  that  board  members  should
represent a broad cross-section of the Republic. The list that is  currently
before the House for approval does not reflect the multilingual and  diverse
nature of South Africa. There is not a single  person  from  the  Afrikaans-
speaking community on the list, despite  the  fact  that  Afrikaans  is  the
third most widely  spoken  language  in  South  Africa,  after  isiZulu  and
isiXhosa. Not only does the Afrikaans-speaking community contribute  greatly
to the coffers of the SABC by means of advertising and payment of  licences,
they are also committed to making the new South Africa work.

Die raad van die SABC is 'n belangrike  liggaam  wat  nie  in  omstredenheid
gedompel moet word nie en, ter wille van versoening  en  nasiebou,  doen  ek
daarom selfs op hierdie laat stadium 'n beroep op die agb President  om  die
samestelling van die raad te heroorweeg ten einde voorsiening  te  maak  vir
ten minste een persoon uit die Afrikaanssprekende gemeenskap  op  die  raad.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)
[The board of the SABC is an important body that should not be plunged  into
controversy and, for the sake of reconciliation and  nation-building,  I  am
appealing to the hon the President, even at this late stage,  to  reconsider
the board's composition in order to make provision for at least  one  person
from the Afrikaans-speaking community on the board. [Applause.]]

Dr P W A MULDER: Agb Voorsitter,  alle  Suid-Afrikaners  van  alle  tale  en
godsdienste word deur die wet  verplig  om  'n  televisielisensie  te  koop.
Daarom is daar tot op datum moeite gedoen om die samestelling van die  SAUK-
raad so verteenwoordigend  as  moontlik  te  maak  sodat  almal  voel  hulle
belange word verteenwoordig. Dit is ook deel van President Mandela  se  styl
van versoening na 1994.

Hierdie name nou voor ons  vir  die  nuwe  SAUK-raad  trek  'n  streep  deur
hierdie  benadering.  Waar  daar   in   die   verlede   konsensus   in   die
portefeuljekomitee was, het dit ook nou verander. Soos in die  President  se
Kabinet is daar byvoorbeeld geen Afrikaner in hierdie raad  nie.  Afrikaners
wat my skakel, sien dit as 'n  oorlogsverklaring  en  vir  die  eerste  keer
ongelukkig  sedert  1994  word  daar  weer  gepraat  van   lisensieboikotte.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER: Hon  Chairperson,  all  South  Africans  of  all  language
groups and religions are being compelled by law  to  purchase  a  television
licence. That is why a lot of effort has been  made  to  date  to  make  the
composition the SABC Board as representative as possible  so  that  everyone
feels that their interests  are  being  represented.  It  is  also  part  of
President Mandela's style of reconciliation after 1994.

These names before us at present for the new  SABC  Board  cancel  out  this
approach. Where in the past there was consensus in the portfolio  committee,
this has now also changed. As  in  the  President's  Cabinet,  there  is  no
Afrikaner  on  this  board.  Afrikaners  who  contact  me  see  this  as   a
declaration of war and, unfortunately, for the first time since  1994  there
is once again talk of licence boycotts.]

Prof Andreas van Wyk, previous rector of Stellenbosch,  said  that  this  is
not acceptable, and so  did  Gert  Claassen,  head  of  the  SABC  Technical
Services, Frits Kok, ex-council member, and  Margot  Luyt,  broadcaster  and
media expert.

Die ANC sê alles moet verteenwoordigend wees, behalwe hierdie raad, lyk  dit
my. Dis duidelik dat ons uit 'n politieke versoeningstydperk  van  President
Mandela na 'n politieke konfrontasietydperk beweeg. Hoe  dom  en  kortsigtig
is dit nie. Die VF Plus sal  hierdie  wetgewing  teenstem.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The ANC says everything should be representative, except, it seems  to  me,
this board. It is clear that we are moving from a  political  reconciliation
period of President Mandela to a political confrontation period. How  obtuse
and shortsighted this is. The FF Plus will vote against this legislation.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  The  MF  notes  the  constraints
regarding selection, but has faith in the abilities and discretion  of  this
committee. It  is  trusted  that  a  good  selection  has  been  made  after
considering a number of issues, such as qualification and  character,  among
others, that would indicate whether a  candidate  is  well  suited  for  the
post.

It is pleasing that Mr Maralack has chosen to  once  again  be  interviewed,
and we hope that this change of mind was caused by a determined  matter  and
not by indecisiveness.

In terms of the Broadcasting Act and national Constitution, all  appears  to
be  intact.  Having  considered  the  committee's  recommendations,  it  is,
however, hoped that affirmative action and gender  equality  will  be  taken
into consideration.

The committee has spent lengthy hours on this, and the MF is certain of  the
board's efficiency.  The  MF  supports  the  committee's  recommendation  of
persons to be appointed as 12  non-executive  members  of  the  SABC  Board.
Thank you.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson,  the  hon  Pieterse  said  that  the  ANC  was
mandated for a better life, and will bring it about.  However,  it  was  not
mandated to dominate every section of the whole society.

Dit is presies wat in hierdie geval gebeur het. Hierdie  raad  wat  aan  ons
voorgehou word, weerspieël nie die  diverse  aard  van  die  Suid-Afrikaanse
samelewing nie. Ek moet ander sprekers ondersteun wat gesê het daar is  geen
Afrikaans-moedertaalspreker in hierdie komitee nie.

Ons kry baie keer dat dit lyk asof die President 'n hand wil uitreik na  die
Afrikaner-gemeenskap toe, maar wanneer dit in  die  praktyk  kom,  word  dit
geïgnoreer. So byvoorbeeld in die Artikel  185-Kommissie  is  daar  net  een
Afrikaner  op,  terwyl  daar   selfs   uit   die   Griekse   gemeenskap   'n
verteenwoordiger is, en uit die Joodse, twee of drie. Ons sien dat  die  ANC
nie ernstig is om werklik die diversiteit  van  die  land  te  verdiskonteer
nie.

Almal moet lisensies betaal en die Afrikaanse mense, 'n groot deel  daarvan.
Oor die TV op TV2 is Afrikaans 'n terugtyd afgeskaal en  die  mark  het  die
mense gedwing om dit terug  te  bring.  Dieselfde  sal  gebeur  met  hierdie
komitee. Ons  ondersteun  dit  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[That is exactly what happened in this case.  This  council  that  is  being
held up to us does not reflect the diverse nature of South African  society.
I have to support other speakers who said that there is no Afrikaans mother-
tongue speaker in this committee.

We often find that it seems as if the President wants to extend  a  hand  to
the Afrikaner community, but in practice it is ignored. For  example,  there
is only one Afrikaner in the section 185 commission, whereas there  is  even
a representative even from the Greek community, and two or  three  from  the
Jewish community. We see that the ANC is not really serious in  its  efforts
truly to negotiate the diversity of the country.

Everyone has to pay licence fees and the Afrikaans people, a  large  portion
of them. On the television on TV2 Afrikaans was scaled down a while ago  and
the market forced people to bring it back. The same will  happen  with  this
committee. We do not support it.]

Mr M K LEKGORO: Chairperson, let us put it on record that,  regarding  those
of our interviewees who did not make it onto the board,  it  was  not  as  a
result of us passing a vote of no confidence in them.  That  we  had  short-
listed them from the 138 candidates we had at the beginning of  the  process
is a statement that they are amongst the best. We would like to  thank  them
for  participating  in  this  process  and  availing  themselves  for   this
important board.

Having said that, I must say that it is rather regrettable for a  member  of
Parliament to agree on a process  set  by  this  institution  and  to  later
vilify those who came through the same process. It is more so in  bad  taste
when the member goes on to pick one white member of those who  came  through
that same process as the only adequate candidate.

It is worse, and I think it borders on unethical behaviour, to stand out  in
public and  mention  people's  names  as  candidates  that  you  might  have
preferred. You might, in your little mind, have thought that you  made  them
feel good, but the flip side  is  that  they  might  be  embarrassed  to  be
preferred by you. To any of those who are affected in this  manner,  we  can
only say that we apologise for the inconvenience they may have been caused.

Section 13(4)(a) to (d) of the  Broadcasting  Act  directs  that  the  board
members,  viewed  together,  should  represent  the   various   competencies
relevant to broadcasting which are mentioned in subsection  (a).  They  must
be persons that are committed to fairness, freedom of expression, the  right
of the public to be informed, openness and accountability  on  the  part  of
those holding public office. They must represent a  broad  cross-section  of
the population of the Republic. To this end, I am  glad  to  report  to  the
National Assembly that the committee has accomplished its task. We are  also
satisfied that we have  attended  to  the  issue  of  gender  balance  to  a
satisfactory level.

We went further to cater for the  representivity  of  disabled  people.  The
deaf of our country  have  made  a  considerable  impact  on  the  issue  of
captioning and subtitling. We are aware that they  felt  strongly  that  the
matter would be given even more urgent attention if one of their own was  on
the board. We hope that through the one disabled  member,  and  through  the
board as a whole, the matter will be attended to once and for all.

On the last day of our interviews,  Mr  Andrew  Maralack,  who  had  earlier
withdrawn from our process, wrote a letter which stated that, and I quote:


  Due to a change in my circumstances, I hereby withdraw my letter dated 15
  September 2003 and declare my availability to serve on the SABC Board.

I took that letter to our parliamentary legal advisers  for  legal  opinion.
In their  opinion,  whether  or  not  to  consider  interviewing  Mr  Andrew
Maralack was a decision that the committee was competent to arrive  at.  The
committee then,  on  the  strength  of  this  advice,  voted  in  favour  of
interviewing Mr Andrew Maralack.

The merits and demerits of this decision depend on one's point of view.  Our
viewpoint  is  that  Mr  Andrew  Maralack  was  indeed  short-listed  to  be
interviewed. Among the short-listed, at least on paper as it  stood  in  the
CV, he was among the best in finances.  He  is  a  chartered  accountant  by
profession. It is beyond any argument  that  for  an  institution  like  the
SABC, which oversees such large sums of money, a competence in finance is  a
need. The second King report also pointed to this dire  need  in  order  for
the board to be able to function.

Without  politicking,  and  because  we  take  the  SABC  Board   with   the
seriousness it deserves, it is against this background that we agreed  that,
if it does not contradict the law, let us allow Mr  Andrew  Maralack  to  be
interviewed.

Let me seize this opportunity  to  also  clarify  the  myth  spread  by  the
opposition about the ANC loading the board with its members.  Early  in  the
days of the interviews, I could understand the fear  of  the  opposition  on
this matter. I had formed an impression that because the ANC  had  nominated
people to be interviewed for the board,  the  opposition  was  worried  that
they would all be appointed to the board. One would have thought that  after
the final selection of the board members had been made, the fear would  have
been taken care of. But, for some reason, this fear has been turned  into  a
deliberate lie. Anyone who looks at the totality of the selected members  of
the board and publicly states  that  it  is  loaded  with  ANC  members,  is
deliberately misleading the public. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Do you deny that?

Mr M K LEKGORO: Yes, the board might have people that you  don't  like;  the
board might be  without  people  you  would  have  preferred,  but  that  is
democracy at work, isn't it? Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

 THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF FATAL ROAD ACCIDENTS INVOLVING PUBLIC AND HEAVY-DUTY
                                  TRANSPORT

                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr S B FARROW: Chairperson, firstly, let me thank the Speaker  for  allowing
this debate to take place in what can only  be  described  as  a  very  busy
parliamentary  session.  This  debate  is  not  only  necessary,  but   also
important, as the recent spate of accidents involving public  transport  and
heavy vehicles has claimed the lives  of  drivers,  commuters  and  innocent
bystanders alike. Again, as the DA we would  like  to  express  our  deepest
sympathies to the families of those  who  lost  their  loved  ones  or  were
injured. With only weeks left before the Christmas  holiday  season  starts,
time is of the essence if we are to stop the carnage that lies ahead of  us.


During the past 12 months, I have  requested  the  Minister  to  organise  a
crisis summit on public and heavy-duty transport ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! hon members, if you  are  leaving  the
House, can you do so quietly? Can  we  ask  members  to  please  take  their
seats? Hon members, please take your seats. Please continue, hon Farrow.
Mr S B FARROW: The DA, at the very least, expected the Minister  along  with
his nine MECs, as well as delegates from  the  taxi  organisations  and  the
heavy-duty freight organisations to call such a summit in order to  put  our
heads together to stop the carnage on our roads. I noticed in press  reports
yesterday that the Minister did take heed  of  our  suggestion  and  that  a
meeting of sorts took place on 17 November. However, it is unfortunate  that
the Minister did not involve the portfolio committee, as I believe  that  as
parliamentarians facing the wrath of the public, we could  have  contributed
significantly to that meeting.

A national campaign called "Operation Juggernaut"  has  been  instituted  by
the Minister to check the roadworthiness of heavy and  public  transport  on
our roads. Although this is  seen  as  a  commendable  effort  with  partial
success so far, it does not address the real issues, namely: The reason  why
these vehicles are on the road in the first  place;  secondly,  whether  the
drivers of these  vehicles  should  even  be  allowed  to  drive  them;  and
thirdly, what urgent steps can be taken to  avoid  accidents  of  a  similar
nature.

Leading from the Minister's response to his  question  today,  the  question
arises as to how or when these changes will be  announced  and  implemented.
Minister, there is one thing that I have in common with you,  and  I'm  sure
even the majority of members in this House too, and  that  is  that  we  all
want to see an end to this problem. Many others  have  seen  or  have  known
someone who has been involved in  an  accident  of  some  sort.  One  of  my
colleagues, the right - I was going to say the ``right hon'' - the  hon  Roy
Jankielsohn nearly lost his life in a road accident recently. My own  father
was the victim of a fatal taxi-related accident some years ago.

The public is looking to us as leaders and legislators to find solutions  to
this wasteful and horrific loss of precious lives on our roads.  The  nearly
10 000 deaths a year - if you rely on the Arrive Alive  figures  -  and  the
more realistic 18 400-plus deaths recorded by the Medical  Research  Council
at provincial mortuaries, are among the worst road accident death  rates  in
the world and cost our economy over R12  billion  annually.  During  October
alone, 1 200 people died on our  roads.  By  comparison,  in  the  whole  of
Australia, only 1 500 people died in the last 10 months.

As part of our effort towards road safety,  the  DA  recently  launched  its
policy document, ``On the  move''.  Although  it  might  not  have  all  the
answers, it certainly goes a long way towards addressing many of them.  This
document was networked over a number of months with as many stakeholders  as
possible, but sadly, your department chose not to  take  the  invitation  to
contribute to the workshops that were held in Cape  Town,  Johannesburg  and
Durban. But many other organisations did. These  included  the  SA  National
Tax Council, Santaco, the Automobile Association,  Drive  Alive,  the  CSIR,
the SA Bureau of Standards, the  truck  freighters'  association,  and  many
more. The objective of the workshop was to find practical and  implementable
solutions to all these matters pertaining to transport in our country.
Transport policies are all very well in theory, provided that  they  can  be
implemented. Unfortunately, the department's policies fall into this  latter
category, for if they could be implemented, we would  be  a  lot  closer  to
solving the huge death  rate  on  our  roads  which,  instead  of  declining
appears to be escalating.

If I can just give the House an example: In 2000,  one  of  the  very  first
pieces of legislation I was involved in  was  the  National  Land  Transport
Transition Bill, something which  the  DA  wholeheartedly  supported  as  it
would form the basis to regulate the taxi industry and  put  in  motion  the
process to recapitalise the taxi industry.  Sadly,  we  all  know  how  this
legislation has materialised. To date not a single taxi has rolled  out  and
it doesn't look likely to happen until the middle of next year.

Despite assurances of everything being on track, and that the  industry  had
been fully democratised, communication problems still  seem  to  exist.  The
present court order in favour of the  KwaZulu-Natal  taxi  council,  against
the Department of Transport, which has to provide them with a memorandum  of
understanding, which was about to be signed, is a point in question. The  DA
has met with a number of taxi associations in most of the provinces,  and  a
lack of consultation and a top-down approach concerning decisions  affecting
the livelihoods of 97 000 taxi operators in this country appear  to  be  the
order of the day. It is a travesty that too many  role-players  with  direct
interests in this industry have been sidelined and left out of the loop.

The net result is that the taxi operators  have  been  forced  to  patiently
await the arrival of their MTV, whilst limiting repairs and  maintenance  to
their own fleets, in many instances making them  unroadworthy.  No  one  has
bothered to investigate the manoeuvrability of  the  new,  bigger  vehicles,
their low rate of acceleration, or the fact that they will be taking  up  to
1,3 times more road space per  passenger  than  that  of  the  minibus.  The
economic viability also has not been thoroughly researched.
Under  these  circumstances  and  with  the  understanding  that  the   taxi
operators are not obliged to take the new vehicles, I beg  to  question  how
many of these vehicles will be taken up and really solve  the  problem  that
we face. Meanwhile, the taxi fleet gets older and older by the day.

Until the taxi recapitalisation project finally commences, the  DA  suggests
that a phased campaign commences for all taxis over five years old,  whereby
thorough and vigorous roadworthy testing takes  place  before  an  operating
licence is issued or re-issued. Subsequent road testing should therefore  be
mandatory on annual relicensing of that taxi. The  same  routine  should  be
applicable for buses. Private sector garages could be  requested  to  assist
in this process. As an immediate  step,  all  taxis,  buses  and  heavy-duty
vehicles should drive with their lights on to  improve  visibility  to  both
other road users and pedestrians alike.

The second piece of legislation,  which  the  DA  supported,  was  the  Road
Traffic Management Corporation Bill. That  Bill  was  also  passed  by  this
House in 2000. As I speak today, we have a  CEO  and  a  few  support  staff
costing this country and its long-suffering taxpayers R794  000  per  annum;
yet there is no business plan in sight, and little or  no  co-ordination  of
road safety is taking place from that office. It is a serious indictment  on
this House to know that only R6 million out of an estimated R57 million  has
been budgeted by the department to get this corporation up and running.

We still sit with an estimated shortfall of 30  000  traffic  officers,  and
heavy vehicles  continue  to  bypass  fixed  weight-bridges  on  our  roads,
causing untold damage to surfaces. Vehicle roadworthy testing and  licensing
stations, which was also one of the key focus areas, still leave  a  lot  to
be desired. How serious are we in addressing these problems?  And  how  long
will it be before we see this new national traffic force that  the  Minister
refers to on our roads, and the budget to support that particular agency?

There can be no more important step that we  can  take  in  the  forthcoming
months than to redeploy  every  available  traffic  officer  onto  our  main
routes to ensure maximum visibility and  enforcement.  Camera  traps  cannot
spot dangerous driving, drunken driving,  missing  head  lamps,  taillights,
bald tyres, unlicensed vehicles and drivers, and unroadworthy vehicles  that
experienced traffic officers and video cameras can.

Over and above this, I truly believe that 100 inspecting  engineers  of  the
department, specially  trained  in  what  to  look  out  for  and  with  the
authority to suspend operating licences, would end the use of  unsafe  heavy
vehicles on our roads in  six  months,  if  properly  co-ordinated.  Serious
offenders must be penalised and owners charged under the  Criminal  Offences
Act. A serious appeal must go out to all transporters,  requesting  them  to
self-police the industry or face the consequences. These officers should  be
seen to be checking drivers and the hours spent on the roads to ensure  that
drivers are not  exceeding  the  permissible  or  prescribed  driving  hours
behind the wheel. All public transporters on long-distance hauls  must  have
obligatory co-drivers. This is something that can be  regulated  immediately
and would have a marked effect on road safety.

The  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Act  must   also   be   taken   into
consideration in respect of working hours. We do not have to  re-invent  the
wheel. We only have to introduce a  couple  of  recognised  innovations  and
developments relating to safe public transport to make our roads safer.  The
sooner we do it, the better.

In Zimbabwe, for instance, they have already  legislated  as  mandatory  the
use of safety tyre bands. In South Africa, 32% of accidents  are  caused  by
tyre failure. These products are known to reduce fatalities by 70%  to  80%,
as they prevent the tyres from coming off  when  punctured.  The  costs  are
minimal.

Private and fleet operators should seriously consider  fitting  these  bands
as part of their contribution to road safety. Daytime running lights,  which
I referred to earlier, should be enforced immediately, as the  Minister  did
for motorcycles some years ago. That, in fact, had a  tremendous  result  as
far as accidents are concerned. It is known that in countries where  daytime
running lights are used and  tested,  a  30%  reduction  occurs  in  head-on
collisions.

Finally, let me say something about the more  serious  problem  which  needs
long-term solutions. This is the problem of educational driver training  and
a behavioural change of our drivers and the impact  of  HIV/Aids  and  other
related illnesses. It is a well-known fact  that  developing  a  culture  of
road safety must begin at  school,  where  children  should  be  taught  the
basics. Programmes must teach school groups about road hazards and the  road
codes, encourage the  wearing  of  reflective  armbands  and  provide  basic
driving instruction to older children. We must have a hard-sell attitude  to
the road safety message and it must be pumped to the general public via  TV,
radio, newspaper features, billboards and forecourt  advertising  at  petrol
stations along main travel and transport routes.
Emphasis must be placed on the wearing of both front and  back  seat  belts,
not driving or  walking  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  and  not  using
cellphones. I'm sure that the department can enter into  some  collaboration
with the fuel distribution companies to assist in this campaign. After  all,
every vehicle, at some stage or other in its journey, has to go and refuel.

Educational  programmes  must  be  accompanied  by  zero-tolerance   towards
dangerous driving. For this to work, traffic officers must  be  seen  to  be
doing their jobs. A 24-hour toll-free number that  responds  to  the  public
reporting serious accidents is actually working. I think that those are  the
sorts of issues that need to be taken seriously.

A loss of competent and experienced drivers to HIV/Aids cannot  be  ignored.
We must ensure that truck stops are available on  major  routes,  to  ensure
that drivers can sleep, wash and eat -  to  reduce  the  fatigue  that  they
experience. All relevant information on the disease, together with  condoms,
should be available in order to educate drivers and  sex  workers  operating
on these routes. Many of the problems faced by the  transport  industry  are
caused by inexperienced drivers having fallen victims to Aids. And this  has
resulted in many younger drivers having to take the wheel. The  DA  believes
in an  apprenticeship  or  mentoring  scheme  for  all  public  and  private
transporters to be enforced by regulation to allow  these  drivers  to  gain
experience. Setas can assist here.

In summary, there are many urgent  interventions  that  can  take  place  in
saving the lives of our people during the next few weeks. And I appeal  once
again to the Minister to call for us to come together and  think  about  how
we can resolve this, because if we don't, Minister, I'm  afraid  once  again
you will be held accountable. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, on behalf of the ANC, I would like to  thank  Mr
Farrow for tabling this matter for a snap debate. I  think  we  welcome  the
chance, as the ANC, to try to reflect, collectively,  across  party  divides
and so forth, upon the high incidence of fatal road accidents,  particularly
those involving public transport vehicles and heavy duty transport.

The Sunday Times, two and half weeks ago, had an interesting,  and  I  think
important, editorial.  It  said  that  road  travel  is  possibly  the  most
extensively regulated aspect of our lives: Vehicles must be  roadworthy  and
licensed each year; laws regulate the depth of treaded tyres, the  state  of
lights, indicators and brakes, even the tinting of  windscreens;  and  there
are laws about how many people or how much  cargo  a  specific  vehicle  may
carry.

Drivers must past tests and get their licences which  specify  exactly  what
types of vehicles they may drive;  the  roadsides  are  littered,  says  the
Sunday Times, with signs which it is a criminal offence  to  disobey;  speed
is regulated on city streets and on highways; you may  not  drive  too  fast
and you may not drive too slowly, etc.

Despite all of these regulations, South Africans  kill  their  countrymen  -
and I would add countrywomen - with shocking frequency each year.  "What  is
the problem?", asks the Sunday Times.

The temptation, says the Sunday Times, in a country that is  still  emerging
from an era of totalitarian rule is to blame the authorities for failing  to
police the laws. It is, after all, the traffic police who  are  supposed  to
see to it that cars are roadworthy, that drivers are licensed and  that  the
rules of the road are obeyed.

This is true, it says, but it fails to identify the problem  satisfactorily.
The authorities, according to the  newspaper,  and  not  me,  have  in  fact
responded very well to the need for policing. Millions in extra funding  are
spent over the festive season to  see  to  it  that  more  officers  are  on
patrol, that more speed traps are set, that more motorists are pulled  aside
and checked, and yet the killing goes on.

The real problem is that many, perhaps most, of the people who are  expected
to obey the law - the drivers and the owners of vehicles - do not  have  the
self-discipline or the mental strength to do so of their own volition.  They
see the traffic police as a force to be  despised,  avoided,  outwitted  and
mocked. When there are no  police  visible,  they  place  themselves,  their
families and other road users in peril because somewhere in their  curiously
ordered psyches they  find  pleasure  in  defying  the  law.  Only  when  we
understand and obey the law, without prompting, will we arrive alive.

I think this a very salutary conclusion. It is saying that we are too  quick
in South Africa to blame authorities. As I  heard  an  ANC  speaker  in  the
previous debate say, "Minister Dullar Omar is not behind the  wheel  of  the
buses, the minibuses and so forth". I think that it is  in  this  spirit  in
particular that we would like, as the ANC, to enter into this debate.

The opinion of the Sunday Times is confirmed by  these  statistics:  90%  of
serious accidents relate to traffic offences; that is,  it  is  not  because
something unfortunately went wrong which was unpredictable  or  unavoidable.
In 90% of the cases there has been an active traffic offence of one kind  or
another on the part of the driver or on the part of an  owner  or  employer.
There is road rage; there is carelessness, arrogance; there  is  the  taking
of chances; there is drinking, and so forth.

We live in a society, unfortunately, in which life is often held cheap.  And
I have said in previous debates, we also live in a society where  the  urban
planning is a recipe for  serious  accidents.  We  have  massive  townships,
sprawling squatter camps surrounded by extremely fast freeway  systems.  All
of these are recipes for serious problems.

It is also important, Mr Farrow and others, to keep a  sense  of  proportion
because otherwise we could easily become absolutely despondent. There is  no
way that any of us would deny that the levels of accidents on our roads  are
unacceptably high, absolutely. However, the statistics - and  they  are  not
entirely reliable  -  we  do  have  suggest  that  in  terms  of  kilometres
travelled per vehicle, there has been a steady and significant decline  over
the past decade, and let us hope that we can continue to do that.

The first key point that we want to make, Minister, is that at the  root  of
the attitude is the culture of South Africans on the road: our attitudes  to
cars, vehicles,  our  roads,  our  passengers  and  to  each  other.  A  key
responsibility in this is often, in our view, caused by advertisements;  for
instance, car advertisements. I think many of us turning on  televisions  or
listening to the radio will note  that  many  car  advertisements  encourage
high speed and reckless  driving,  and  associate  those  things  with  male
virility, with physical prowess and so forth.

But there are other examples of reckless advertising. I have here  in  front
of me a copy of the  latest  Sawubona,  that  is  distributed  by  SAA.  The
headline of an advertisement carried in Sawubona reads:


  The Zulu Kingdom welcomes reckless drivers. If you like driving  you  are
  going to love the Zulu Kingdom.

[Interjections.] I'll tell you in a moment who it is.


  Long and winding, straight or narrow, slow or fast, you  will  find  that
  the trip is as pleasurable as  the  end  result  of  you  getting  there.
  Situated on the East Coast of South  Africa  is  this  wonderful  natural
  wonderland that embraces a free spirit. Here is absolutely no  reason  to
  fiddle with a safety belt. No speed limit and certainly  no  restrictions
  as to the driving tactics that you employ. Come  to  KwaZulu-Natal:  Push
  your driving skills to the limit! Only in the Zulu Kingdom, South Africa!

It is actually an advertisement for golf; to encourage people  to  come  and
play golf in KwaZulu-Natal. It is taken up by Tourism KwaZulu-Natal, and  if
I am not mistaken it  falls  under  the  MEC  for  economic  affairs,  Roger
Burrows, your associate. I hope that  in  your  consultation  process  about
driving, Mr Farrow, perhaps you forgot  to  consult  Roger  Burrows  in  the
process. There is clearly no understanding of the responsibilities  that  we
need to take in terms of encouraging safer driving. [Applause.]

But, of course, it is shocking. It is meant to be a joke, and so on. But  to
say that public attitudes,  public  conduct  and  the  fostering  of  decent
public attitudes surrounding a driver are very important, does not and  must
not, obviously, excuse  Government  in  all  its  three  spheres:  national,
provincial and local. In the first place visible policing, as Mr Farrow  has
correctly  said,  is  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  of   encouraging,
sustaining  and  fostering  changed  public  attitudes,  unfortunately.   We
shouldn't have to be reminded by the presence of police, but in the  reality
that we live in, having visible policing on our roads is  a  very  important
factor in assisting us to be encouraged to think more  constructively  about
how we use our roads.

A few weeks back, Minister, in my constituency which, as you  know,  is  out
in Eerste River, Blue Downs, somewhere on the Cape Flats, I  was  approached
by the Eerste River Taxi Association and they  said:  "Can  we  get  to  the
Minister?" I said, well, I don't know, but perhaps I  can  help,  and  asked
them what the problem was. And they said that there was a problem of  pirate
taxis operating there in Eerste River, and they wanted the Minister to  come
and sort it out. They even implied that there might be some trouble  if  the
Minister was not able to sort it out. I said to them - I  hope  that  I  was
right, Minister - look, I think the Minister would like to  help,  but  this
is a matter that has to be sorted out at  the  local  level.  In  the  first
instance that is what we have to do.

I approached the  community  policing  forum,  my  colleagues  and  comrades
there. I approached the local police station, a  satellite  police  station,
Kleinvlei, which is linked to  Kuilsriver.  We  also  approached  the  Metro
police who have joint responsibility in Cape  Town  for  overseeing  traffic
offences,  as  well  as  the  local  development  forum  in  Eerste   River,
Bluedowns.

What was very encouraging was that they all came to this meeting,  including
the Eerste River Taxi Association. The problem of this association was  that
there were three or four pirate taxis that were operating in the area.  They
have knowledge of the local area, so they were able to say  exactly  who  it
was and what colour their minibuses were and so forth.

The police then came. I was really pleased to see the  senior  officer  from
Kuilsriver, outside the  area,  overseeing  the  satellite  station,  and  a
senior from the Metro police who took time off from detaining Sactu  workers
who were protesting outside the Cape Town Airport - well,  that  is  another
matter - to attend this meeting.

What the police said to us - both the local police and the  Metro  police  -
was that they agreed with them and that they would certainly come into  that
area and would look for pirate taxis, but they wanted  to  tell  the  Eerste
River Taxi Association that they would not discriminate; they will  look  at
all taxis,  and  if  a  taxi  was  unroadworthy  or  a  driver  was  driving
dangerously, and so on, then they  had  invited  lightning  onto  their  own
heads.

The Eerste  River  Taxi  Association  accepted  this  in  good  spirit,  and
correctly so. They said this was indeed part  of  their  plans,  and  I  now
realise that what they were talking about was  Operation  Juggernaut,  which
the department, in conjunction with many  others,  has  now  launched  on  9
November  to  support  Arrive  Alive,  if  I  understand  correctly.  If   I
understand correctly, the idea of Operation Juggernaut  is  aimed,  in  this
month of November, at finding unfit  drivers,  and  unfit  and  unroadworthy
trucks, buses and minibuses so that we get those off the road ahead  of  the
festive season.

An unroadworthy vehicle will be suspended on the spot. There  is  a  24-hour
rolling operation. This is not just a couple of hours here  and  there,  and
it will roll right through till 29 November. And then in December,  and  all
the way through to January, the same operation will extend to other  things,
broadening the spectrum and looking at drunken driving and so forth.

This morning I was nearly late for my portfolio  committee  meeting  because
at the intersection of Klipfontein and Liesbeek ParkWay,  there  they  were,
out in force, pulling off minibuses. I saw  they  were  taking  breathalyser
tests and so on. So, there on  the  ground,  certainly,  in  my  experience,
whether in my constituency or on my way to work,  we  are  seeing  Operation
Juggernaut, not as a theory, but  actually  being  rolled  out.  One  really
commends the department and wishes them well in taking this forward.

All of this is not going  to  work  unless,  of  course,  we  have  the  co-
operation of all stakeholders in this process. It is not just about  traffic
policing or the department; it's about the owners, the operators,  the  taxi
formations, the AA and so forth. Therefore, I was very happy, along with  Mr
Farrow, who felt that he had convened the meeting but  was  not  invited  to
it.
I was very pleased to see, Minister, that you had taken  the  initiative  on
Monday, 17 November, to convene what  I  think  is  called  a  road  traffic
safety board meeting, which involved a wide range of stakeholders, in  order
to encourage them to  buy  in  to  this  important,  concrete  and  specific
campaign.

There is one aspect that I would like particularly to highlight  in  all  of
this. I think that as  the  Minister,  you  are  sensitive  to  this.  I  am
actually wearing my Cosatu tie, to remember that amongst the victims in  the
terrible accidents that have happened were Cosatu workers on their way to  a
May Day rally. They are not the only victims, alas, but were  also  involved
in a very significant and tragic accident at Saulspoort. So that  is  partly
why I thought I should wear my  tie  today.  But  it  is  also  for  another
reason.

Drivers are frequently blamed, and sometimes they are to  blame.  Sometimes,
however, the real origin of bad driving lies elsewhere, namely in the  long,
long hours of driving; very poor working conditions for many of them;  being
compelled to drive in vehicles that are unroadworthy,  but  being  desperate
for a job and feeling they have little say over the matter; and the  neglect
of training, and here the responsibility lies very firmly  with  owners  and
employers in particular, who often pursue profits. In a  capitalist  society
that is a legitimate pursuit, no doubt, but  often  that  pursuit  overrides
safety issues.

Therefore we welcome the intention of the department to  introduce  measures
quite soon whereby we would not just suspend or cancel licences of  drivers,
but also possibly of suspend and even  cancel  operating  licences,  because
the owners and employers, when they are unscrupulous and  pursue  profit  at
any price, must also suffer very seriously.

We also need, and I know the Minister is looking at this, to use  Teta,  the
Transport  Education  Training  Authority,  to  ensure  that   drivers   are
equipped, skilled and so forth. I also believe that you are working  closely
with the Department of Labour to draft an appropriate definition of  working
conditions so that we can set regulations for  working  conditions  in  this
area. I am sure that you will also  bring  the  trade  union  movement  into
looking at safety for drivers.

There are, of course, some areas of concern. You are well  aware,  Minister,
that we would like to see the road traffic  management  corporation  up  and
running and, if not, if it is proven to be a  model  that  is  not  working,
that a decision be made in that direction. It is a point that we  have  been
making and we would like to use this opportunity. We would also like to  see
the points demerit system in operation.

In conclusion, I might be guilty of politicising the matter, but at the  end
of the day, let us not politicise it.  This  is  a  concern  for  all  South
Africans; that is the position of the ANC. We encourage all South  Africans,
regardless of political and other affiliation, please to work  together,  to
change attitudes and to co-operate with the  authorities.  And  let  us  all
have a safe  festive  season  and  arrive  alive.  Thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Prince N E ZULU: Mr Chairperson, hon Ministers and  colleagues,  it  is  not
uncommon in South Africa to talk about road fatalities involving public  and
heavy-duty transport. It has been embedded in our  thought  system  that  we
always hold our breath at Easter and Christmas time.

Road users behave recklessly during  these  seasons  with  the  belief  that
their ill-mannered behaviour will be understood  within  the  context  of  a
season. In a human rights culture there is no such thing as  seasonal  death
or seasonal fatality.

We deplore  the  publicity  given  to  the  KwaZulu  Kingdom,  as  has  been
demonstrated here by the  last  speaker,  in  the  Sawubona  magazine.  It's
unfortunate that this publicity, bad as it  is,  has  been  carried  out  so
widely on the South African airwaves.

Lately we have seen  a  string  of  uncalled-for  fatalities,  including  12
deaths in Limpopo, 6 in KZN and 10 in the Karoo, as well as  15  injured  in
the Free State, to name but a few. The IFP expresses its sympathies  to  all
the families of the victims of these fatalities.

Is it because it is in our  system  to  understand  and  tolerate  such  bad
driving behaviour? The answer is no. We believe that all avenues  have  been
explored to  address  this  issue.  We  have  seen  traffic  officers  being
arrested for allowing laxity through bribes. We also have the  Arrive  Alive
campaign, Operation Mpimpa, Zero Tolerance  in  KZN,  and  Don't  Drink  and
Drive countrywide. All these  are  very  powerful  campaigns.  In  a  normal
driver society and human-rights-respecting culture, they would have worked.

Those who travel by air have inner peace, though this is supposed to  impose
a near-fatal thought to the passenger. But the reality is that with  public,
heavy-duty and road transport, everyone begins  to  calculate  the  plusses,
divisions and minuses, as soon as he or she  thinks  about  taking  a  trip,
because death is just the blink of an eye away.
It has, of late, become important for a well-behaved road  user  to  make  a
decision on which route to take, the type of car to  drive,  its  mechanical
state, or even how fast he drives. In all fairness, the Government has  done
its share in addressing the situation and we cannot, and should  not,  blame
any one  person  more  than  we  should  blame  ourselves  individually  and
severally as road users.

Our attitudes should change, for the future of our society.  Perhaps  a  few
suggestions might work. Uneconomical as it may seem, we  need  to  legislate
retraining of road users from time to time. If this is done,  from  time  to
time, for aviation transport worldwide, why can't it be good to  do  it  for
road transport?

We also need to think about setting aside lanes for  public  and  heavy-duty
vehicles. Thorough research should also be undertaken as to  whether  it  is
not possible to get a safety feature, or device, that will  detect  impaired
driving performance to alert the driver that  he  or  she  is  bordering  on
crashing the vehicle.
We accept the penalty decided on by  the  national  Minister  of  Transport,
together with the provincial transport MECs, and various transport  industry
stakeholders on Monday, in Midrand, of six years'  imprisonment  or  a  R120
000 fine, or both, which will  be  given  for  drunken  driving  during  the
festive season. Even though our drivers have no regard  for  the  law,  when
one is languishing in jail because of a sheer mistake  and  because  of  the
fact that the fine is unaffordable to most reckless drivers, it  will  bring
some sense for the future.

It is the taxi, bus and truck drivers who mostly commit these offences,  not
the owners of companies or operators they work for, who may  afford  to  pay
this fine.  We  thank  you,  Mr  Minister,  for  informing  the  House  this
afternoon of the measures to  be  taken  on  our  roads.  However,  can  you
inculcate a new culture of traffic policy, namely for  cops  to  be  visible
throughout the length and breadth of our roads, rather than  hide  behind  a
tree to trap speeding drivers at that  particular  point  only,  while  many
traffic offences are being committed elsewhere on the  road?  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]
Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Meneer die  Voorsitter,  ek  vereenselwig  my  graag  met
vorige sprekers wat hulle kommer uitgespreek het oor  die  slagting  op  ons
paaie. Die aankondigings  wat  die  Minister  vanmiddag  gedoen  het  tydens
vraetyd oor sekere maatreëls wat getref gaan word om te help om te  verseker
dat ons paaie veiliger word, is ook te verwelkom.

Ek wil tog reg aan die begin vra dat die Minister  vir  ons  werklikwaar  so
gou doenlik meer besonderhede beskikbaar sal stel, asook die  datum  wanneer
hierdie goed in werking gaan tree. Maar, meneer  die  Voorsitter,  met  alle
respek, hierdie is die korttermynoplossings wat op die tafel  geplaas  word.
Ek dink die tyd het aangebreek dat ons, soos wat vorige sprekers  ook  reeds
voorgestel het, om 'n tafel gaan sit en 'n lang-  en  mediumtermynbeplanning
op  die  tafel  plaas  sodat  hierdie  klomp  wapens  van  massavernietiging
permanent van ons paaie verwyder kan word, want ons het  infrastruktuur  wat
weliswaar opgeknap kan word.

Die tyd  het  aangebreek  dat  ons  weer  behoorlik  gebruik  maak  van  ons
spoornetwerk. Hoe langer ons aanhou, hoe  swakker  sal  die  situasie  raak.
Meneer, dit is 'n alombekende feit dat om een kilometer teerpad te  bou,  R6
miljoen kos. Om hom te rehabiliteer, kos R2,5 miljoen. Om net een  kilometer
teerpad te herseël, kos R1,2 miljoen. Dit is die koste wat  veroorsaak  word
deur oorlaaide, oorgewig vragmotors op ons paaie wat ook 'n  gedeelte  bydra
tot die slagting op ons paaie. Ons kan dit verhoed deur  hierdie  mense  van
ons paaie af te haal.

Baie  sprekers,  en  ons  stem  daarmee  saam,  het  al  gepraat   oor   die
onpadwaardigheid van voertuie. Dit is die een enkele  grootste  oorsaak  wat
aanleiding gee tot ongelukke. En diegene van u wat gereeld op  die  pad  van
die dood tussen Laingsburg en Beaufort-Wes ry, sal met my saamstem dat  daar
maniere is hoe ons hierdie probleem kan oplos.

In die eerste plek, meneer, het ons in die jare  sewentig,  en  u  sal  goed
onthou, 'n ligte-toetsingveldtog gehad. Vandag as jy op die nasionale  paaie
ry, is hierdie vragmotors se hoofligte ver in die toekoms ingestel sodat  hy
betyds die verkeersman kan sien. En die moment as hy die  ligte  domp,  gooi
hy hom vol op jou as motorbestuurder se gesig wat jou totaal  verblind.  Dit
is een van die oorsake van ongelukke. Ons behoort, en ek wil staan  daar  by
- mits ons spoornetwerk regkom -  hierdie  voertuie  van  die  paaie  af  te
verwyder sekere tye van die dag, veral ná sononder.

'n Ander ding wat ook aandag behoort te geniet - en die  agb  Jeremy  Cronin
het verwys na wat  in  die  Sunday  Times  geskryf  gestaan  het  -  is  dat
padverkeer die mees gereguleerde ding in ons  land  is,  maar  dat  dit  die
meeste oortree moet word. Maar ons kan gerus daarna kyk - weer  eens  verwys
ek na die pad van die dood. Dit is mos net eenvoudig  nie  menslik  moontlik
as tien van hierdie voorhakers teen 'n spoed van 120km  per  uur  20  of  30
meter uitmekaar soos 'n lang trein daar op  daardie  pad  aangaan  nie.  Dit
maak ander motoriste mismoedig. Mense vat kanse en  probeer  verbysteek,  en
wanneer hulle langs hierdie ding kom, besef hulle dis hopeloos  te  laat  en
dis doodsgevaarlik.

Ons behoort, noudat u die stilhouplekke ingestel het  -  ek  weet  dis  meer
werk wat nodig is - dit so te reguleer dat daar te alle tye  nie  binne  een
kilometer van mekaar af van hierdie lang vragmotors op die  pad  behoort  te
wees nie. Ek weet die padvervoermense gaan huil daaroor -  hulle  praat  van
hulle  geld.  Maar  dit  was  makliker  vir  my  die   afgelope   week   ter
voorbereiding van hierdie toespraak om 'n  tender  te  kry  om  'n  vrag  te
vervoer na Johannesburg. Die antwoord was maklik.  Die  padvervoermense  kon
'n antwoord gee, maar by die spoornetwerk kon ek geen antwoord kry nie.

En dan die laaste ding, daar waar weegbrûe, en ek is bly u  het  aangekondig
dat daar  mobiele  weegtoestelle  gaan  wees,  meneer  ...  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Mr Chairman,  I  would  like  to  associate  myself  with
previous speakers who expressed their  concern  about  the  carnage  on  our
roads. The announcements that the Minister made today during  Question  Time
about certain measures that will be taken to help to ensure that  our  roads
become safer are also to be welcomed.

Right at the outset I want to ask that the Minister really will  provide  us
with more details as soon as possible, as well as  inform  us  of  the  date
when these things are going to be implemented. But, Mr  Chairman,  with  all
due respect, these are short-term solutions that are being tabled.  I  think
the time has come for us to go and sit around a table, as previous  speakers
have already suggested as well, and  come  up  with  long-  and  medium-term
planning so that this lot of weapons of  mass  destruction  can  be  removed
permanently from our roads, because we do indeed  have  infrastructure  that
could be upgraded.

The time has come for us  to  utilise  our  railway  network  properly  once
again. The longer we continue, the worse the situation will become. Sir,  it
is a well-known fact that it costs R6 million  to  build  one  kilometre  of
tarred road. To rehabilitate it costs R2, 5  million.  To  reseal  only  one
kilometre of tarred road costs R1, 2 million. This is  the  cost  caused  by
overloaded, overweight trucks on our roads, which also contribute  partially
to the carnage on our roads. We can prevent this by  removing  these  people
from our roads.

Many speakers have already spoken about the  unroadworthiness  of  vehicles,
and we agree with that. This is the single biggest cause of  accidents.  And
those of you who travel regularly on the road of  death  between  Laingsburg
and Beaufort West will agree with me that there are ways  in  which  we  can
resolve this problem.

In the first place, Sir, we had,  and  you  will  remember  well,  a  light-
testing campaign in the seventies. If one  travels  on  the  national  roads
today, one notices that the headlights of these trucks are focused far  into
the future so that the driver can see the traffic officer in time.  And  the
moment he dims the lights, he casts his lights straight in  one's  face,  as
driver, and this blinds one  completely.  This  is  one  of  the  causes  of
accidents. We should, and I want to insist on this - if our railway  network
is restored - remove these vehicles from our roads during certain  times  of
the day, especially after sundown.

Another thing that should receive attention -  and  the  hon  Jeremy  Cronin
referred to what was written in the Sunday Times - is that road  traffic  is
the most regulated thing in our country, but that it must be  the  one  that
is broken most often. But we can really  look  at  it  -  once  again  I  am
referring to  the  road  of  death.  Surely  things  simply  become  humanly
impossible when ten of these articulated  vehicles  travel  at  a  speed  of
120km per hour 20 to 30 metres from one another, like a long train  on  that
road. It disheartens other motorists. People take chances and  try  to  pass
them, and when they come alongside this thing they realise  it  is  hopeless
too late and it is deadly dangerous.

Now that you have established the stopping-places, we should - I  know  more
work is needed - regulate them in such a way that these long trucks  should,
at all times, not be within one kilometre of one  another  on  the  road.  I
know the road transport people will cry about it -  they  talk  about  their
money. But during the past week, in preparation  for  this  speech,  it  was
easier for me to obtain a tender to transport a load  to  Johannesburg.  The
answer was easy. The road transport people  could  give  an  answer,  but  I
could not get any answer out of the railway network.

And then the last thing, where there are weigh-bridges, and I  am  glad  you
have announced that there will be mobile weighing devices, Sir ...]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member, your time has expired.

Mr C B HERANDIEN: Ek dank u, mnr die Voorsitter. [Applous.]  [I  thank  you,
Mr Chairman. [Applause.]]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, travelling on  South  African  roads  has  become
hazardous, with an increase in unsafe  vehicles,  road  surfaces  and  human
error. The recent spate of road accidents  involving  heavy  freight  trucks
requires urgent intervention. We also wish to express our sympathies to  the
families of those who died and were injured in these collisions.

Road accidents in South Africa cost the lives of 12  000  persons  annually,
and  although  the  Arrive  Alive  campaign  posits  success   through   its
initiatives, the question still remains, "Why such  high  accident  rates?".
There can be no doubt that to control road accidents the adequacy of  driver
training and testing must be reviewed.

South African drivers are purported to be below  the  accepted  standard  of
driver proficiency and professionalism. They have even  less  competence  in
adequate collision avoidance driving techniques. Besides  having  roadworthy
and sound mechanical  vehicles,  companies  should  be  compelled  to  equip
drivers with adequate resources for rest to avoid fatigue. And I would  join
the previous speaker who  suggested  that  during  evenings  heavy  vehicles
should be compelled to go alongside the road.

Drivers should also be  required  to  undergo  regular  health  checks.  The
department must insist that all companies keep  an  updated  record  of  the
wellbeing of their drivers. Something must also be done  about  the  serious
levels of HIV/Aids among truck drivers.

The festive season is upon us and we  trust  that  the  department  will  do
everything  in  its  power  to  effect  appropriate  law   enforcement.   We
consequently welcome the Juggernaut campaign. However,  as  pointed  out  by
previous speakers, it is a matter of personal conscience for all road  users
to obey the law, irrespective of whether there is a law-enforcement  officer
present.  We  must  be  responsible  road  users  and   show   respect   and
consideration for one another and  our  public  roads  in  order  to  arrive
alive. Thank you.

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI: Chairperson, South Africa is regarded  as  one  country
with the best infrastructure in Africa, one aspect of that being the  roads.
But over the years that has not given us a clean bill of health with  regard
to fatal accidents that occur on these roads.

The recent spate of fatal accidents, particularly  those  affecting  trucks,
leaves much to be desired. It is impossible  at  this  stage  to  say  which
factors contributed to the accidents, but  the  following  reasons  are  the
biggest contributors: traffic violations and driving under the influence  of
alcohol.

These fatal accidents bring human tragedy and  serious  social  consequences
to families, particularly those that are already affected  by  poverty.  All
our road users have to take co-responsibility for what is happening  on  our
roads. We  need  to  co-operate  to  make  our  road  environment  safe  for
ourselves and also for the other road users.  Every  vehicle  owner  has  to
keep his or her vehicle in a roadworthy condition. We  also  have  to  treat
others with respect on the road, as we would like to be treated.

The accident that occurred on 20 October 2003 at Tugela Ferry which  saw  17
people killed and 13 others injured, could have been avoided. Again, it  was
a drunken driver who decided to disregard the  rule  of  law  by  recklessly
driving while under the influence of liquor.

The pensioners who were involved in that accident were  queuing  to  collect
their grants from a mobile unit when  a  truck  tried  to  overtake  another
truck. The hawkers there, who are the breadwinners of  their  families,  and
the pensioners whose families depend on their meagre income, had  to  suffer
because of the recklessness of one individual.

In this case, I would like to thank Minister Zola Skweyiya  for  his  prompt
response in this matter. The Minister quickly assembled  a  team  to  assist
the victims and their families to lessen the burden of the funeral costs.

The consequences  of  reckless  driving  have  a  long-term  impact  on  the
affected families, while the perpetrator is going on with his life. We  need
our courts to take traffic offences seriously and impose harsh sentences  on
those road users who endanger the lives of others.

These human tragedies place an unbearable burden, again,  on  the  families,
the community and also the Government. Perhaps  the  DA  should  stop  using
these to play party politics with regard to  such  a  sensitive  issue.  How
many people do each one of us in this House  know  whose  disabilities  were
caused by reckless driving? Many of those people are breadwinners.

The consequences of this for these families cannot be costed. Through  these
tragedies, families have broken up. Young children have  lost  opportunities
to go to school. Some had to drop out of school and become  beggars  on  the
streets. Other victims resort to alcohol owing to  denial,  frustration  and
depression brought about by the negative changes in their lives.  All  those
positive dreams that they had about their future and  the  future  of  their
families have been squashed by an individual who did not  have  respect  for
others on the road.

Many of the above people now  depend  on  a  meagre  grant  that  Government
provides, and have to take care of their families and  all  their  needs  on
the little that they get. In many cases, some of these  people,  even  those
who were well-off, lose their houses and their investments because  all  the
investments that they had accumulated over the years  have  to  be  used  to
cover the basic needs. Indeed, serious  punishment  has  to  be  imposed  on
defaulters.

I want to thank the Minister for the recent decision that he took, with  the
MECs, to actually  increase  the  minimum  sentence  for  these  defaulters.
Sometimes all of us disregard the law and think that talking on a  cellphone
without proper equipment while driving,  and  not  wearing  seat  belts  are
minor  offences.  We  must  always  remember  that  it  can   have   serious
consequences for ourselves and for other people as well.

Poor people sometimes cannot afford to drive  roadworthy  vehicles  and  put
their lives and other people's lives in danger. In all  townships  you  find
many unroadworthy vehicles on the road, and a disregard for the law. I  call
on municipalities to put more resources  where  they  are  needed  most  and
minimise possible accidents on the roads.

Owners of vehicles in every corner of South Africa, even in  the  townships,
have to ensure that their vehicles  are  safe  and  are  taken  for  regular
roadworthy testing, and the law enforcement officers must enforce the law.

The Department  of  Transport  has  undertaken  a  number  of  campaigns  to
minimise road accidents. Arrive Alive and Operation Juggernaut are but  two.
The Minister announced that next year a call centre to  report  drivers  who
endanger lives on  the  road  will  be  operational.  All  these  and  other
measures that the Government puts in  place  to  make  our  roads  safe  are
futile exercises if road users themselves behave irresponsibly on the road.

Government cannot be blamed for  all  accidents.  I  urge  all  road  users,
particularly drivers who drive unroadworthy vehicles, to  observe  the  rule
of law. In a few weeks' time, we will be starting  our  festive  season  and
many people will be travelling to different places to spend  Christmas  with
their families and friends, many of whom do not have vehicles of their  own,
but depend on public transport.

I urge people to choose safer means of transport. They  must  refuse  to  be
bundled  into  overloaded  buses  and  taxis,  and  report  these   to   the
appropriate authorities.  For  instance,  the  Department  of  Transport,  I
think, Mr Minister, must at  least  have  a  24-hour  service.  I  know  the
Minister knows places like Langa and Philippi, from which areas  most  buses
and taxes depart, ferrying people from Cape Town to the Eastern  Cape.  What
is happening in those places is that, owing to the demand, buses  that  have
not been on the road for a long time decide to come and  actually  transport
people. These are the ones that cause accidents on the road.

We have to actually make sure that we nip this in  the  bud  and  not  allow
them even to move from the spot  where  they  are.  The  danger  that  these
accidents pose is actually serious and is very costly  to  the  country  and
its people, and in money terms it cannot be costed.

In this case, we wish all our people a happy Christmas and new year, but  we
must make sure that while they enjoy it, they still have  to  take  care  of
their lives because there are so many other people out  there  who  actually
would want to use this period to take other  people's  lives  and  cause  so
many people to be disabled and unable to look after themselves.

Let us all be good and responsible citizens and make  sure  that  our  roads
are safe for ourselves and other people. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G  T  MADIKIZA:  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  without
overstating semantics,  I  have  to  point  out  that  the  word  "accident"
originally meant an unforeseen and unfortunate incident.

When a large  vehicle  is  overloaded,  unroadworthy  and  speeding,  and  a
collision or crash occurs, it is no accident. The essence of road safety  is
responsibility. When we speak of preventable and unnecessary road deaths  as
accidents, we acknowledge the lack of responsibility by many road users  and
members of the traffic authority.

A culture of carelessness has become  acceptable  on  our  roads.  Too  many
vehicle owners and drivers, including, but not  limited  to  heavy-duty  and
public transport, simply do not bother to comply with the law.  On  the  one
hand, many traffic authorities do not bother with enforcing the law  in  its
entirety. Under such circumstances it is no accident that tens of  thousands
of South Africans die on our roads every year.

The problem is not the lack of laws, but rather  a  permissive  attitude  by
drivers and some  authorities  alike.  A  mindset  has  developed  in  which
otherwise responsible road users are beginning to say: "Everybody  does  it,
so why can't we?"

Can any of us honestly say that in a single day on our roads we do  not  see
drivers who jump red traffic lights, tailgate vehicles  in  front  of  them,
neglect to use indicators, do not wear seat belts or drive with  a  cellular
phone pressed against their ear?

Twice a year, the Government spends millions on campaigns that mostly  focus
on speeding. For the rest of the year,  speed  trapping  and  parking  fines
seem to be the sole activity of most traffic authorities. At some  point  we
need to acknowledge that two million speed traps will not stop the  carnage,
because speeding is just one factor in the road deaths. I thank  you.  [Time

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Agbare mnr die Voorsitter, verskeie  sprekers  het  hier
gesê dat die vervoersektor basies die sektor is wat  die  meeste  gereguleer
word. Ek wil vir  die  agb  Minister  sê  as  ons  praat  oor  padongelukke,
spesifiek wat taxi's en swaarvoertuie betref, gaan dit  oor  die  aspek  van
wetstoepassing.

'n Agb lid het hier verwys na die pad van die dood. Dit  is  'n  200km  stuk
pad op die N1 tussen Beaufort-Wes en Laingsburg. Ek  wil  die  agb  Minister
uitnooi om op van  'n  Donderdag  af,  sê  so  twee  uur,  tot  en  met  die
Vrydagaand twee uur op daardie pad te wees. Ek  sal  vir  u  sê  die  aantal
taxi's wat daar verbykom, veral in die dag, 98% van hulle  is  oorlaai,  90%
van  hulle  se  ligte  werk  nie  behoorlik  nie,  want  die   probleem   is
wetstoepassing hou agtuur die aand op. Ek wil vir die agb  Minister  vra  om
te kyk dat daar langer wetstoepassing gedoen word.

Ek is oortuig dat as die wetstoepassing daar toegepas  word  daar  letterlik
miljoene rande uit boetes gemaak  sal  word  en  dan  wil  ek  vir  die  agb
Minister sê daardie geld moet aangewend word om  verkeersbeamptes  behoorlik
op te lei. Ek dink dit is skandalig as 'n mens in 'n koerant moet  lees  van
'n verkeersbeampte wat 'n persoon 'n boetekaartjie  gee  omdat  sy  remligte
brand as hy die rem trap, of dat sy truligte brand as sy voertuig in  trurat
is. Ek dink dit is skandalig. Ons sal daarna moet kyk.

'n Verdere aspek, ek wil vir die agb Minister sê daar is 'n weegbrug op  die
N12 net buite Potchefstroom wat meer buite werking is as wat hy  in  werking
is. Dit het ongeveer twee jaar gevat vandat  hulle  hom  gebou  en  miljoene
rande daaraan gespandeer het, maar hy werk nie en daarom wil ek vir die  agb
Minister sê as ons dit begin toepas dan sal ons beter verkeersreëls  op  ons
paaie kan begin toepas. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Hon Chairperson, various speakers have  said  here  that
the transport sector is basically the sector that is regulated the  most.  I
want to tell the  hon  Minister  that  when  we  speak  of  road  accidents,
specifically those involving taxis  and  heavy  vehicles,  it  concerns  the
aspect of law enforcement.

An hon member has made reference to the road of death. It is  a  stretch  of
road 200km long on the N1 between Beaufort  West  and  Laingsburg.  I  would
like to invite the hon Minister be on that road from a Thursday,  let's  say
about two o'clock, until Friday night at two o'clock. I will tell  you  that
of the  taxis  that  pass  there,  particularly  during  the  day,  98%  are
overloaded, and 90% of them do  not  have  lights  that  function  properly,
because the problem is that law enforcement ceases at eight o'clock  in  the
evening.

I am convinced that  if  law  enforcement  is  undertaken  there,  literally
millions of rands can be made from the fines and I  want  to  tell  the  hon
Minister to use that money to train traffic officials properly. I  think  it
is a disgrace when one reads in the newspaper  of  a  traffic  official  who
writes out a ticket to a person because their  brake  lights  come  on  when
they apply the brakes, or  because  the  reverse  lights  are  on  when  the
vehicle is in reverse. I think it is a disgrace. We shall have  to  look  at
this.

A further aspect that I want to convey to the hon Minister is that there  is
a weigh-bridge along the N12 just  outside  Potchefstroom  that  is  out  of
commission more than it is operational. It took almost two  years  from  the
time they had built and spent millions of rands on it, but it does not  work
and therefore I want to tell the hon Minister that if we start using it,  we
will be able to start enforcing better traffic rules  on  our  roads.  Thank
you.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. According to the  Medical  Research
Council, there were 18 443 deaths in South Africa in  the  year  2000  as  a
result of road accidents. The MF is horrified  by  this  and  calls  for  an
intensification of road safety nationally.

A total of 108 deaths have been estimated over the past month  as  a  result
of bus, minibus taxi and truck  collisions.  We  are  very  concerned  about
these fatalities and even  more  concerned  about  the  approaching  festive
season, when road accidents are usually at their peak.

The MF has great respect for and confidence in the Minister  of  Transport's
ability to address such issues and make our roads safer. However,  a  recent
rise in road accidents involving public and heavy-duty  transport  has  been
noted. Just this past weekend 12 people were killed and  two  injured  in  a
collision between a minibus and a truck on a  road  between  Thabazimbi  and
Northam. Early the same day in Polokwane, a runaway  truck  smashed  into  a
funeral procession, injuring 31 people, as a result of failed  brakes.  This
is frightening and worrying. We need to step up our road  safety  with  this
sector of transport.

We have not forgotten the 13 people who died when their  bus  crashed  on  a
slippery road and the 21 people who were killed as a result of  a  collision
between a truck and a bus two weeks ago. These  are  but  a  few  fatalities
which occurred over the past month in South Africa.  Our  sympathies  go  to
all the families who have lost their loved ones.

A  weekend  roadblock  near  Laingsburg  in  the  Western  Cape  netted   17
unroadworthy vehicles, with traffic officers issuing 196 summonses.  The  MF
is pleased that efforts are being made to step up road  safety,  but  it  is
concerned and seeks a tighter grip on the situation, especially with  regard
to public and  heavy-duty  transport.  We  give  our  full  support  to  the
Minister  of  Transport  in  such  endeavours.   Thank   you,   Chairperson.
[Applause.]
Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Voorsitter, die voorkoms van noodlottige ongelukke  waarby
openbare  en  swaarvoertuie  betrokke  is,  het  in  die  onlangse   verlede
epidemiese afmetings aangeneem en daarom  verwelkom  die  NA  hierdie  debat
vandag in die vertroue dat dit 'n werklike verskil gaan maak, ook hier  voor
die vakansieseisoen.

Allereers is dit eers 'n saak wat nie gepolitiseer moet word nie  en  daarom
ons dank ook aan die inleier van hierdie debat  wat  hom  nie  verpolitiseer
het nie, maar met positiewe voorstelle gekom het.

Ons moet kyk oor die lang termyn, die medium termyn en die kort termyn.  Wat
die lang termyn betref, daar is 'n Afrikaanse liedjie wat sê:  "Solank  daar
treine loop, is daar geen skeiding." Ons moet weer die treine laat  loop  in
Suid-Afrika - dit het  die  agb  Herandien  gesê.  Paaie  word  oorlaai  met
swaarvoertuie waarvoor die paaie  nie  toegerus  is  nie  en  'n  toenemende
ekonomiese groei gaan hierdie lading eenvoudig laat toeneem.  'n  Neweproduk
van as ons ons spoorweë weer aan die gang kry  sal  wees  werkskepping,  die
herstel  van  uitgestorwe  plattelandse  gemeenskappe   -   ry   maar   deur
Middelburg, De Aar en Noupoort  en  u  sal  besef  die  verdwyning  van  die
spoorweë is 'n groot oorsaak van ontvolking van die platteland.  Ek  versoek
u, Minister, om 'n deeglike  uitvoerbaarheidstudie  te  laat  doen  oor  die
finansiële implikasies as ons werklik weer ons spoorweë laat herstel.

Oor  die  medium  termyn  moet  korrupsie  aangespreek  word,   wat   betref
padwaardigheidsertifikate van voertuie. Jy  kan  in  Pretoria  vir  R395  'n
padwaardigheidsertifikaat kry al het jou kar nie  eers  remme  nie.  Onlangs
moes ek 'n kar deur die toets sit; dis 'n BMW - dis 'n  oue,  ek  is  lankal
ryk. Die persoon by die toetsentrum sê vir my verkope  het  toegeneem,  maar
wettige padwaardigheidstoetse by die  toetsentrums  het  afgeneem.  Duisende
voertuie kry padwaardigheidsertifikate sonder ligte, remme, wat ook al.  Ons
steun die kwessie van mobiele weegbrûe. Swaarvoertuie  gaan  gewoon  met  'n
ompad verby die statiese weegbrûe en hulle ry dan ander paaie klaar.

Oor  die  kort  termyn:  Beter  wetstoepassing,  zero   toleransie   teenoor
oortreding,  nie  net   mobiele   toetssentrums   nie   maar   ook   mobiele
verkeersbeamptes - hy moet opduik waar jy hom nie verwag nie.  Ons  vra  ook
begrip by ander padgebruikers vir die  swaarvoertuie.  [Tyd  verstreke.]  Ek
dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, the incidence of  fatal  accidents  involving
public and heavy vehicles has  recently  reached  epidemic  proportions  and
therefore the NA welcomes this debate today in the hope that it will make  a
real difference, now just before the holiday season.

First of all it is not something that should be  politicised  and  therefore
we thank the opener of this debate who did not engage in  politics  but  put
forward positive proposals.

We must look at the long term, medium term and short  term.  Concerning  the
long term, there is an Afrikaans song that goes: "Solank daar  treine  loop,
is daar geen skeiding." ["As long as there are trains running  there  is  no
separation"] We must get the trains moving again in  South  Africa,  as  hon
Herandien said. Roads are overburdened with heavy  vehicles  for  which  the
roads are not equipped and increasing economic growth will  simply  increase
this load. If we can get our railways on track again a by-product  would  be
job creation, the restoration of deserted rural  communities  -  just  drive
through Middelburg, De Aar and  Noupoort  and  you  will  realise  that  the
disappearance of the railways is a major cause of the  depopulation  of  the
countryside. I request you, Minister, to have a  feasibility  study  carried
out on the financial implications of having our railways repaired.

In the medium term corruption  should  be  addressed,  with  regard  to  the
roadworthy  certificates  of  vehicles.  In  Pretoria  one  can   obtain   a
roadworthy certificate for R395  even  if  your  car  doesn't  have  brakes.
Recently I had to put a car through the test, it is a BMW -  it  is  an  old
one, I've been rich for a long time. The person at the testing  centre  told
me that sales have increased, but legal roadworthy tests at testing  centres
have decreased. Thousands of vehicles without lights, brakes  -  whatever  -
obtain roadworthy certificates.  We  support  the  issue  of  mobile  weigh-
bridges. Heavy vehicles merely bypass  the  static  weigh-bridges  and  thus
damage other roads.

In the short term: better law enforcement, zero tolerance for offences,  not
only mobile testing centres but also mobile traffic  officers  -  he  should
pop up where you don't expect him. We also ask for understanding from  other
road users for heavy vehicles. [Time expired.] I thank you.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Hon Chairperson, I wish to  focus  on  heavy-duty  transport.
Here is what I would dearly like to see implemented.

Firstly, weigh-bridges on the N1, N2 and other arterial routes, 24  hours  a
day, seven days a  week,  as  the  hon  Farrow  also  asked  for;  secondly,
taillights for heavy-duty trucks should be of a  special  type  and  length,
allowing clear detection of  such  vehicles  by  those  that  are  following
behind. We could ask the CSIR to undertake the necessary  research  in  this
regard. Thirdly, I would like to see the provision of  affordable  overnight
facilities for heavy-duty trucks at regular  intervals.  In  this  regard  I
fully support the hon Cronin in what he said about driver fatigue.

Fourthly, we need to ameliorate the boredom factor, particularly on the  N1,
where  there  are  long  straight  stretches  of  monotonous   road.   Water
fountains, for example, where the Orange River crosses the N1 could  have  a
great reviving effect on drivers. Other  such  devices  could  be  used  and
maybe the Department of Arts and Culture could assist in this matter.

Fifthly, I would  like  to  see  the  use  of  digital  signs  permitting  a
reduction of speed limits when road and weather conditions are  poor.  These
are used  in  Australia.  Sixthly,  suggestion  boxes  could  be  placed  at
identified filling stations; seventhly, phone  numbers  should  be  provided
where motorists on a  particular  road  can  provide  information  or  lodge
complaints to a co-ordinating office, and, lastly,  roadside  courts  should
be  made  permanent,  and  we  should  appoint  roadside  researchers  where
accidents are frequent. Let such researchers camp on the  spot  for,  maybe,
three to six months so that they could actually tell us  what  is  going  on
and help us find solutions. Thank you.

(Translation of Tsonga paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs T L P NWAMITWA-SHILUBANA: Chairperson, both  Government  and  the  road
transport industry have expressed their concern over  the  recent  spate  of
accidents involving public and heavy-duty  vehicles.  These  accidents  have
again highlighted concerns over road safety on South African roads.

About 31 people die on South African  roads  every  day,  which  amounts  to
about 11 315 people every year. You will agree with me that this  figure  is
too high. This year alone, a total of 7 499 people have already died on  our
roads between January and  October.  During  October  four  fatal  accidents
involving taxis and trucks killed nearly 60 people and injured more than  40
others.

Accident statistics for the period 1 October to 11  November  2003  indicate
that  trucks,  buses  and  minibus  taxis  have   contributed   heavily   to
fatalities. Of these accidents, 87 were in Gauteng, followed by 81  in  KZN,
79 in the Western Cape, 65 in the Eastern Cape, 59 in Mpumalanga, 46 in  the
North West, 44 in the Free State, 33 in  Limpopo  and  12  in  the  Northern
Cape. Of the people killed, 211 were passengers,  170  pedestrians  and  125
drivers.

As already stated, we believe that the main causes of  these  accidents  are
general recklessness, negligence, inconsiderate driver behaviour and  poorly
maintained vehicles. Research conducted indicated that in  the  majority  of
cases, 57,1% of bus accidents had been caused by  driver  and  human  error,
for example reckless driving such as overtaking  in  the  face  of  oncoming
traffic.  Twenty-eight  comma  six  percent  had   been   caused   by   poor
maintenance,  and  only  14,3%  had  been  caused  by  road  conditions  and
environmental factors such as mist and rain.

The Road Freight Association also believes that  poor  vehicle  maintenance,
poorly  trained  drivers  and  overloading  are  major  causes  of   freight
accidents. This is especially a problem with regard  to  unscrupulous  truck
owners who use unsafe and overloaded vehicles with untrained drivers.]

The Road Freight Association has, as a result, emphasised the importance  of
law enforcement to address the problem. It has also suggested that  the  use
of two drivers on long-distance trips should  become  a  legal  requirement,
which we fully support. A lack of stop-over facilities for truck drivers  on
certain routes should be addressed.

The national road traffic regulations were amended  on  25  September  2003.
Various important amendments have  been  promulgated  which  affect  various
areas in the transport industry.  To  mention  but  a  few:  That  different
grades of driving licence examiners are  introduced;  training  requirements
for  drivers  of  trucks  with  dangerous  goods  have  also  been  amended;
extensive amendments to the traffic signal legislation have  been  published
and, as already mentioned, the use of cellphones without  a  hands-free  kit
or a walk-and-talk device should be abolished.

Lexi nga sala eka vatirhisi hinkwavo va mapatu i  ku  xiyaxiya  milawu  leyi

paragraphs follows.)
[All that is left is for all road users  to  observe  all  road  regulations
which the Government has laid down, the Government that is  concerned  about
the safety of its people.

The  National  Department  of  Transport  has   launched   its   ``Operation
Juggernaut'' that aims to curb road accidents  during  the  festive  season.
Operation Jaggernaut will complement the  Arrive  Alive  campaign  and  will
focus on road  law  enforcement  during  the  festive  season,  with  strong
emphasis on overloaded and unroadworthy taxis, trucks and buses.

Other areas of focus will be speeding, the use  of  alcohol  and  pedestrian
safety.  As  part  of  the  implementation  of  Operation   Juggernaut   the
department  has  allocated  R12  million  for  distribution   to   the   law
enforcement agencies at both provincial and local traffic authority levels.

In conclusion I want to point out that as a result of the high rate of  road
accidents, the economic and social aspects of our country are affected.  Two
weeks ago in Limpopo they were constructing a road and they also  put  up  a
sign which, when green, allowed vehicles to proceed, and  when  it  was  red
they were to stop.]

The lorry that came had a brake failure and it crashed into the  back  of  a
taxi, and eventually six cars were involved and 11 people died.

Hikwalaho hi nge mali leyi tirhisiwaka hi timhaka ta makhombo  a  yi  fanele

[That is why we say that money that was supposed to be used for the RDP  and
other  programmes  is  being  spent  in  relation  to  these  accidents  and
fatalities.

In the past four years a lot of money has been spent as a  result  of  these
accidents. For example, in 2000 about R13,4 billion was used, in 2001  about
R61,1 billion and in 2002 about R18,7 billion. These figures  have  to  come
down.]

You can see that the figure is rising.

Christmas. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Thank you, Chairperson. I'm on the podium  today  for  the
first time since a motor vehicle accident that left  me  with  a  number  of
broken bones and other injuries. It is therefore with this personal  insight
into the pain and trauma of road accidents that  I  stand  before  you  here
today. I'm fortunate to have survived since many  victims  of  accidents  do
not even make it into the trauma unit.

My hometown of Kestell has lost many of its sons and daughters in  the  past
few years, four of whom were children who were killed in  an  accident  last
year owing to a reckless truck driver. And who  can  forget  the  Saulspoort
Dam bus disaster that took place at Bethlehem this year, and left 55  people
dead and many families traumatised? According to  the  SA  Medical  Research
Council's report on unnatural road deaths in South Africa in 2001, 28%  were
as a result of road accidents.

Before we can decide what can be  done  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  road
accidents, we must determine what the causes of accidents are. In  my  view,
the major causes of accidents may be placed into four  categories:  Firstly,
there are natural elements, over which  we  have  little  control,  such  as
rain, mist and darkness; secondly, there are infrastructural  defects,  such
as potholes and other road  defects,  road  construction  and  bad  signage;
thirdly, we have human error, which includes aspects  relating  to  fatigue,
bad judgment and slow reactions; and fourthly, there is criminal  behaviour,
such as reckless driving, driving without driver's licences,  driving  under
the  influence  of  alcohol  and  drugs,   and   deliberately   driving   in
unroadworthy and defective vehicles.

In many instances, accidents may occur as  a  result  of  a  combination  of
these factors and may have been avoided if one of them was  not  applicable.
There are two instances, however, that  are  inexcusable.  These  are  where
criminal behaviour has taken place or where  road  signs  are  defective  or
nonexistent, especially during bad weather.

I have driven in Bloemfontein during rain when the  white  lines  fade  away
completely, and drivers have to try and judge where the traffic  lanes  are.
A friend of mine, on hearing that I was giving this  speech  today  informed
me that a taxi passed both him and a traffic  officer  in  Cape  Town  on  a
yellow line with total disregard for the law or  the  fact  that  a  traffic
officer  was  present.  In  fact,   the   traffic   officer   ignored   this
transgression completely. This type of behaviour from  the  driver  and  the
lack of action from the traffic officer are unacceptable.

There are some things that could be done to  improve  the  situation.  These
include, among others, the following: firstly, a campaign  to  repair  roads
and ensure adequate road signs across the country. As an  example,  I  would
like to refer to the Senekal-Paul Roux road  in  the  Free  State  that  has
become dangerous to drive on and has to  carry  the  heavy  traffic  between
Cape Town and Durban. Secondly,  we  need  zero  tolerance  law  enforcement
campaigns to clamp  down  on  and  remove  unroadworthy  vehicles,  reckless
drivers and people without driver's licences from our roads. Very often,  we
see such vehicles and  drivers  receive  a  fine  and  thereafter  they  are
allowed back on our roads. Dangerous vehicles should  be  removed  from  our
roads and impounded. Thirdly, improve the railroad infrastructure to  supply
an alternative cheap transportation system to get trucks off our  roads.  It
is virtually impossible to pass trucks in the  rain  or  at  night  on  some
roads, which forces road users to take unfortunate risks.  Fourthly,  public
transportation must be drastically improved.  Such  systems  must  be  user-
friendly and safe, if they are going to become an  alternative  to  personal
vehicles and taxis.

There are good drivers on  our  roads.  It  is,  however,  the  unroadworthy
vehicles and illegal and irresponsible drivers who  continue  to  place  the
lives of  other  road  users  at  risk.  With  a  concerted  effort  by  law
enforcement officials and co-operation between various levels of  government
regarding an improvement in the quality of roads, accidents may be reduced.

In the interim, my advice to South Africans this coming  festive  season  is
simple: Stay at home! And if you have to leave home, you can  always  go  to
KwaZulu-Natal and play golf. I'm sure the hon Cronin will be  there  playing
golf, probably without his Cosatu tie. [Laughter.]

In closing, I would like to use this opportunity to thank all the  emergency
personnel as well as the doctors, sisters and nurses who have to  deal  with
the most horrific scenes of pain, suffering and  death  on  a  daily  basis.
They are the real heroes and heroines who continue to fight  to  save  lives
of victims of this carnage. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Thank you, Chair. Hon members, I  would  like  to
thank all members who have participated in this debate.

It is clear from  what  everyone  has  said  that  there  are  no  quick-fix
solutions; that there are long-term, short-term and  medium-term  strategies
which we should follow. Many members have expressed outrage at some  of  the
things that have happened on the road,  and  I  think  that  that  is  quite
correct. We all feel a sense of outrage. I  want  to  join  those  who  have
expressed condolences to the families of those who have lost loved ones  and
to wish those who have been injured a speedy recovery.

If I say that there are no quick-fix solutions, it does not mean that  there
are not things that we could do immediately, and the programme that  we  are
following  over  the  current  period  represents  some  of  the  short-term
initiatives that need to be taken in an attempt to  stem  the  tide  and  to
ensure that we reduce the number of collisions to a  minimum,  and  that  we
get road users to observe the rules of the road.

I have looked at all the major accidents that  have  taken  place  over  the
past two months. I've got a list of them here, but I'm not going to  mention
them. I just want to indicate to you that there is  not  a  single  case  in
which it was the road or  road  condition  which  was  responsible  for  the
collision. Not a single case. In all these cases, the collisions have  taken
place on good roads, not on bad roads. I know that we do have bad roads  and
part of the responsibility of different levels of government is  to  address
that infrastructure problem. There are programmes in place  and,  hopefully,
over the next few years, we will see a much more  systematic  and  concerted
approach to ensure that all our roads are good roads.

I also do fear that if all our roads  are  good  roads,  what  is  going  to
happen to behaviour on our roads? It has to be accompanied by  a  change  of
attitude. If I say that there is not a single case in  which  the  road  was
responsible for the accident, that does not mean that we must  not  look  at
our roads. We must look at our roads on a continuous  basis.  We  must  make
sure that our road signs are adequate and we must make sure  that  our  road
markings are of assistance to road users. These are matters  which  we  have
discussed.

The SA National Roads Agency, which is responsible for national  roads,  has
embarked upon a programme to look at all  of  these.  Also,  our  provincial
counterparts  are  doing  exactly  the  same.  So  in  terms  of  our   road
conditions, a great deal of work is going on.

I also believe that consultation is very important. This was  raised  during
the course of this debate. I do consult very widely. We have  meetings  with
the SA National Taxi Council, with the road  freight  association  and  with
the bus industry. We have consultations with other stakeholders.

We are spending quite a bit of money to organise small bus operators in  our
country, because there are many of them in  every  province  and  they  form
themselves into provincial organisations with  great  difficulty.  They  are
not often able to meet, but that is the area in which some  of  our  biggest
problems occur. We have also met with them, called them  together,  assisted
them to get together, and we  have  met  with  other  stakeholders  in  that
industry.  Saboa,  the  Southern  African  Bus  Operators  Association,   is
important, but very few small operators belong to Saboa.

So we interact with the small operators in all the provinces through  myself
directly, through the department, through the  provinces  and  even  through
the local government level, with two objectives in  mind:  one,  to  promote
black economic empowerment and  to  ensure  that  the  contracts  which  are
available to the bus industry are spread and broken up into  smaller  chunks
and can be accessed by small bus operators, and secondly, to ensure that  we
do those things which help to promote road safety  -  vehicle  fitness,  the
training of drivers and a host of other related things.

I must say that from the organised industries  we  have  received  good  co-
operation. Santaco and Saboa, for example, are  implementing  programmes  of
their own, though we are not leaving it to them.

In so far as training is concerned - which  was  stressed  by  a  number  of
people - we have invoked the assistance of  Teta,  the  Transport  Education
and Training Authority. There are a number of transport  chambers.  Teta  is
the one Seta that is working very successfully.  I  cannot  comment  on  the
others, but Teta works very successfully. It consults regularly  as  to  the
kind of training programmes we want. It is training  drivers  of  buses  and
drivers of trucks  and  minibus  taxis  in  a  host  of  matters,  including
driving; raising standards and creating  recognised  qualifications  in  the
process, so as to give drivers an incentive. It also  provides  training  in
business management for taxi operators and small bus  operators,  and  there
are other levels of training in which Teta is also engaged.

At the level of the industry itself, we meet with the organisations and  try
to influence the kind of programmes they have in  respect  of  training.  So
training is very, very important, and consultation is important. I  want  to
say that, for example, at the Road Traffic Safety  Board  meeting  which  we
had on Monday, the trade union SA Transport and Allied  Workers  Union,  was
represented.

In fact, Satawu participated in the meeting, because  the  issue  of  driver
fatigue cannot just be addressed in  a  high-handed  manner.  We've  got  to
address it by taking into account the kinds of problems  which  exist,  with
drivers under heavy pressure - both  in  the  taxi  industry,  the  trucking
industry and the bus industry, and with some of the big coaches moving  from
one part of our country to the other - to  reach  their  destinations  by  a
particular hour.
Even though there is a requirement that two drivers must  be  used  on  long
distances, that in itself does not  solve  the  problem.  It  mitigates  the
problem, but for so long as there are those pressures on drivers, this  kind
of problem will continue. So, we are working with the Labour department,  as
the hon Jeremy Cronin indicated; we are looking  at  the  Labour  department
and we have met with the Labour department. There is a special task team  to
look at hours of  work  for  drivers  and  others,  conditions  of  service,
pensions, health benefits and a host of other  things.  We  are  encouraging
the industry and the trade unions to meet, because they need to come  to  an
agreement.  Some  of  these  matters  can  be  resolved  through  collective
bargaining.

I'm also happy to say that the trade  unions,  the  taxi  industry  and  the
others that I have mentioned participate in Teta, so they can have a say  in
the kinds of programmes which are being developed.

I'm not going to comment on taxi recapitalisation today, except to  indicate
that the programme is  on  course.  There  are  difficulties.  A  number  of
legitimate concerns were raised during meetings of the portfolio  committee,
one of which was the question of affordability. I can report to  this  House
that the Department of Trade and Industry is currently engaged in the  best-
and-final-offer process to determine the best price that we can obtain  from
the manufacturers. I believe that that process should  be  completed  before
the end of this year. Then we will be able to  meet  with  the  industry  to
discuss what the  possibilities  are  and  the  levels  of  assistance  that
Government can give.

However, irrespective of what happens  to  the  recapitalisation  programme,
the National Land Transport Transition Act provides that by  a  date  to  be
fixed by the  Minister,  no  public  passenger  transport  vehicle  will  be
licensed  unless  such  a  vehicle   complies   with   the   basic   minimum
specifications, such as roll-over bars, chassis, speed limiters and  so  on.
By another date to be fixed by the Minister, no vehicle will be  allowed  on
the road unless it complies with those specifications.

So you must look at the recapitalisation programme in  context,  because  it
is part of a larger programme, many of  the  elements  of  which  have  been
implemented quite successfully. There is the  big  issue  of  infrastructure
for the new taxis, but that is an issue which we have discussed with  Salga,
because it is very much a local government issue.

This brings me to the issue of different  levels  of  responsibility.  There
has been a reference, for example, to Langa and other areas, and it is  true
that the Department of Transport  and  the  national  Minister  must  assist
where  they  can.  However,  many  of  these  issues  are  local  government
functions. Many of them are provincial government functions.  Now,  we  must
not make scapegoats of one or other level of government. What I'm saying  is
that we all have some responsibility, even  our  NGOs.  All  of  us  have  a
responsibility. The various stakeholders have a responsibility.

The challenge facing us is to co-ordinate our activities in such a way  that
we are able to meet our responsibilities at the different levels,  and  that
is what we are working on at the moment. I  agree  with  the  view  that  we
mustn't have traffic police hiding behind bushes. What we  want  is  visible
policing. If a traffic policeman's presence can compel a  driver  to  reduce
speed, it is much better than trapping the person driving at high  speed.  I
agree with the view which has been expressed that we need  to  address  this
problem.

With regard to Tugela Ferry,  I  just  wanted  to  mention  that  the  much-
maligned Road Accident Fund played a very, very important role in  assisting
families. In all the accidents to which I have referred - there is almost  a
dozen of them that I have here - one of the first to come  forward  was  the
Road Accident  Fund.  In  every  single  case,  it  has  provided  families,
immediately, with an amount of R10 000, in respect of each  person  who  has
been killed, to assist families with regard to funerals, etc. This  has  got
nothing to do with other claims that families may have.  I  am  just  saying
that that kind of initiative  by  the  Road  Accident  Fund  has  been  much
appreciated by everyone.

There is the question of sentences.  There,  too,  we  need  a  bid  of  co-
ordination. We have discussed  this  matter  in  Cabinet.  I  just  want  to
quickly give you one example of the type of problem we experience.

A few days ago, in Limpopo province, a loaded truck  came  out  of  a  minor
road and crossed a main road. There is a stop  sign  along  the  minor  road
requiring this vehicle to stop. In addition, there was a person with  a  red
flag trying to flag down vehicles, warning them and  asking  them  to  stop.
This truck driver did not stop. He ignored this warning,  crossed  the  main
road, went smack-bang into a minibus taxi  and  killed  12  people.  He  was
taken to the police station and he was released on warning.

We also have examples of fines which are imposed  by  traffic  police  being
drastically reduced by prosecutors in some of the areas. We  have  good  co-
operation at some levels, but at some levels  there  are  also  problems  in
that regard.  We've  raised  and  discussed  this  matter  in  Cabinet  and,
hopefully, we can get better co-operation at that level.
Chairperson, I've decided not to bore you with all  the  programmes  we  are
engaged in over the holiday period. If our portfolio committee has time,  we
can get our team to make another presentation,  especially  with  regard  to
the coming holiday period.

I brought this toy along. It is a credit card verification device.  We  have
managed to acquire 100 of them, and they  are  now  being  used  very,  very
effectively. It reduces the amount of time that a  traffic  officer  has  to
spend by at least 50%, and it doubles and trebles the amount of input.

There are a number of things that this machine does. It gives direct  access
to the  National  Traffic  Information  System,  Natis.  It  allows  traffic
officers, from wherever they stop a vehicle, to  check  with  Natis  whether
the driver's licence is valid or not. It can also check the details  of  the
vehicle, whether the registration is a genuine registration  or  whether  it
is fraudulent, whether the vehicle has been licensed again or not  licensed.
It also checks whether the professional driver's permit is a valid one,  and
a number of other things of a similar kind. It performs 10 functions.

There are 100 of them out at the moment and we are  hoping  to  spread  them
out throughout the country because it is very clear to us that  the  use  of
technology plays a very, very important role in making law enforcement  more
effective.

In conclusion, I agree with the view that we  have  a  challenge  to  change
attitudes and change behaviour, but I also agree with the view that we  need
tough  law  enforcement,  because  without  tough   law   enforcement,   law
compliance will be eroded. That is the reason we are concentrating  a  great
deal, through Operation Juggernaut, on  the  question  of  law  enforcement,
tough law enforcement and, already, that programme is showing some signs  of
success.

May I once again thank hon members for their very positive support  for  the
programmes, and I, too, wish you all a very merry Christmas and a happy  New
Year. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

National Assembly:

Papers:

1.    The Speaker:


     Tenth Report of the Working Group on the African Union:


     Following on its Ninth Report, adopted by the  House  on  25  September
     2003, the Working Group would like to report as follows:


     (1)    Ratification of the Pan African Parliament (PAP) Protocol


        The PAP Protocol requires ratification  by  a  simple  majority  of
         Member States that are party  to  the  original  AEC  Treaty  which
         provided for the Pan African Parliament. There are 47  states  that
         are signatories to that Treaty and therefore  24  instruments  were
         required. In terms of Article 22, the Protocol  enters  into  force
         30 days after the deposit of the instruments of ratification  by  a
         simple majority of the Member States.


        On 14 November 2003, HE Prof Alpha Oumar Konare, Chairperson of the
         AU Commission, announced that the Protocol  on  the  Pan    African
         Parliament has received sufficient ratifications  to    enter  into
         force after 30 days from that day (14 November 2003).


     (2)    Beginning of first term of office of the Pan African Parliament


        It is the intention of the  Commission  to  convene  the  Inaugural
         Session towards the end of January 2004, probably in the 3rd  week.
         Thus, the Pan African Parliament will  be  established  within  the
         timeframes set by the 2nd Summit of the AU  held  in  Maputo  which
         had resolved that the Pan African Parliament should meet before  31
         January 2004. The  Chairperson  of  the  Commission  is  consulting
         President Chissano, Chairperson of  the  African  Union,  regarding
         the dates for the Inaugural Session and confirmation of the  venue.
         The Resolution of the Summit relating to the PAP had also  stressed
         the importance of setting up this  organ  "which  will  ensure  the
         effective and full participation of  the  African  Peoples  in  the
         Development and Integration of the Continent".


     (3)    Election of delegation to the Pan African Parliament


        The Working Group would like to draw to the attention of the  House
         the following provisions of the Protocol:


         -  Each Member State  shall  be  represented  in  the  Pan  African
              Parliament by 5 Parliamentarians, at least one of  whom  shall
              be a woman (Article 4.1);


         -   The  representation  of  each  Parliament  shall  reflect   the
              diversity of political opinions in each national Parliament or
              other deliberative organ (Article 4.2);


         -  The Pan African Parliamentarians shall be elected or  designated
              by  the   respective   National   Parliaments   and/or   other
              deliberative Organs of the  Member  States  from  among  their
              members (Article 5.1);


         -  The Pan African Parliamentarians shall vote  in  their  personal
              and independent capacity (Article 6);


         -  Membership of the Pan African Parliament shall  be  incompatible
              with the exercise of executive  or  judicial  functions  in  a
              Member State (Article 7);


         -  The Pan African Parliament shall elect,  at  its  first  sitting
              following its election,  by  secret  ballot,  from  among  its
              members and in  accordance  with  its  Rules  of  Procedure  a
              President and four Vice Presidents representing the Regions of
              Africa as determined by the OAU (now AU). The election  shall,
              in each case, be by simple majority of the members present and
              voting (Article 12.2).


         The Working Group recommends:


         (a)     That the Houses elect the 5 members who  are  to  serve  on
              the Pan African Parliament,  in  terms  of  the  Protocol.  It
              should be noted that the delegation will comprise members from
              both Houses.


         (b)     That parties need to discuss and agree on  the  composition
              of the delegation and the election process.


         The Working Group in its Eighth Report gave  the  following  option
         regarding representation:  If  the  largest  party  is  to  have  a
         majority - 3 members from the largest  party  and  2  members  from
         among other parties.


         In the same report, the Working Group recommended that at  least  3
         of the members should be women. This  report  was  adopted  by  the
         Assembly on 25 September 2003.


         Once these members have  been  elected,  Parliament  will  need  to
         inform the AU Commission by 30 November 2003, indicating the  names
         of the members, the process of their election and their  curriculum
         vitaes so that representivity can be considered.


         The Commission has indicated that a Credentials Committee  will  be
         set up  before  the  Inaugural  Session.  The  Committee  will  not
         accredit  any  representatives  who  do  not   conform   with   the
         stipulated requirements of gender and political diversity.


         The  Commission  has  also   distributed   for   consideration   by
         Parliaments the "Draft Oaths of Office" for Members  and  Presiding
         Officers. Parliament also needs to  make  recommendations  on  what
         committees should be set up at the Inaugural  Session  as  well  as
         the nature of the debate to be held at that  Session.  The  Working
         Group is currently considering these matters with a view to  making
         recommendations.


     (4)    Reporting Mechanisms


        Parliament should also consider how the five  members  of  the  PAP
         will report. The  Working  Group  has  previously  recommended  the
         establishment of a Committee, before the Inaugural Session  of  the
         PAP, to process and deal with issues  emanating  from  the  African
         Union and the Southern African Development Community  Parliamentary
         Forum (SADC-PF). The Committee  would  also  discuss  mandates  and
         receive reports from the members of the PAP with a view to  tabling
         them.


     The Working Group recommends:


     (a)    That  a  Committee  on  the  African  Union  be  established  as
         previously proposed and agreed to by the House when it adopted  the
         Eighth Report.


     (b)    That the terms of reference of the Committee as suggested in the
         Eighth  Report  be  amended  to  exclude  the  SADC-PF   and   SADC
         Parliament, pending developments in that regard.


     Report to be considered.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality  of
     Life and Status of Women, dated 26 September 2003:


         The Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of  Quality  of  Life
         and  Status  of  Women,  having  considered  the   Report  of   the
         Independent Experts' Assessment on Women, War and  Peace  (UNIFEM),
         reports that it endorses  the  recommendations  contained  in  that
         Report, in particular the following:


         1. The Secretary General of the UN to give  priority  to  achieving
              gender parity in his appointments of  Special  Representatives
              and Envoys beginning with the minimum of 30% in the next three
              years with a view to gender parity by 2015.


         2. Gender  equality  to  be  recognized  in  all  peace  processes,
              agreements  and  transitional  governance  structures  with  a
              minimum of 30% representation of women in all negotiations.


         3. Establishment of a United Nations Trust Fund for Women's  Peace-
              Building.  The  fund  must  be  used  to  leverage  political,
              financial and  technical  support  needed  for  women's  civil
              society organisations and women leaders to have an  impact  on
              peace efforts.  The  Fund  should  be  managed  by  UNIFEM  in
              consultation with other UN agencies.


         4. UNIFEM and the Department of Political Affairs (DPA)  to  ensure
              that  gender  issues  and  women's  full   participation   are
              incorporated    in    peace-building     and     post-conflict
              reconstruction. UNIFEM and UN Population Fund  (UNFPA)  to  be
              represented in all relevant inter-agency bodies.


         5. Peace Negotiations and agreements to have a  gender  perspective
              through  the  full  integration  of   women's   concerns   and
              participation in peace processes.


         6. UN and donors to invest in women's organisations as  a  strategy
              for conflict prevention, resolution and  peace-building.  They
              should exercise flexibility in  responding  to  urgent  needs,
              time-sensitive  opportunities,  and  foster  partnerships  and
              networks  between  international,  regional  and  local  peace
              initiatives.


         7. National electoral laws and international  electoral  assistance
              to establish quotas to achieve  gender  parity,  ensure  voter
              registration, education and increase in the ratio of women  in
              electoral commissions and observer  missions  and  to  provide
              training for women candidates.


         8. A lead organisation to be designated within the  United  Nations
              for women's education  and  training  in  conflict  and  post-
              conflict situations. This  lead  organisation,  together  with
              UNESCO, UNHCR and UNICEF, should  ensure  that  all  education
              programmes for displaced persons provide for women as well  as
              girls.


         9.  The  International  Labour   Organisation   (ILO)   to   expand
              vocational and skills  training  for  women  in  post-conflict
              situations including in non-traditional,  public  and  private
              sectors, in a manner that is sustainable and responsive to the
              local and national economy.


         Additional recommendations by Committee:


         1. That a regional TRC  structure  on  violence  against  women  in
              armed conflict for women in Africa be established  within  the
              African Union and that it be linked to the International Truth
              and Reconciliation Commission on  violence  against  women  in
              armed conflict under the United Nations  as  proposed  in  the
              UNIFEM  report  as  a  step  towards  ending   impunity.   The
              continental  structure  should,   however,   model   a   joint
              government and civil society initiative.
         2. Further decreasing  domestic  violence  should  be  a  criterion
              against which countries will be reviewed in the  African  Peer
              Review Mechanism process.


         3. That a Council  for  African  women  mediators  be  established,
              comprising women who are not in active formal politics and who
              will be available and who may be utilised  as  special  envoys
              and who as a council will have a special status with the Peace
              and Security Council.


         4. That training workshops be facilitated  for  empowering  African
              women  with  conflict  analysis,  negotiation,  mediation  and
              leadership skills.


         5.  That  relations  with  the   DRC,   Rwanda   and   Burundi   be
              strengthened.


         6. That a delegation of women leaders be sent to  Burundi  and  the
              DRC to work towards facilitating lasting peace.


         7. That a mission of three women leaders from  each  of  the  Great
              Lakes countries and South Africa  be  constituted  to  support
              international efforts for  establishing  peace  in  the  Great
              Lakes Region.


         8. That the Peace and Security Council  of  the  African  Union  be
              engendered with immediate effect.
