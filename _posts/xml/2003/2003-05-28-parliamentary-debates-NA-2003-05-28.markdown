                         EDITING OF ARMS DEAL REPORT

Ms R TALJAARD:  Chairperson, I hereby give notice that I shall move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  statements by the Auditor-General that  he  had  no  choice  in
           editing the JIT Report due  to  section  4(6)  of  the  Auditor-
           General Act of 1995;


       (b)  that section 4(6) was notoriously used by the apartheid  regime
           to hide certain military  and  intelligence  projects  from  the
           public and that it offends against sections 181 and 188  of  the
           Constitution and may well be unconstitutional; and


       (c)  that the statement of  the  Auditor-General  merely  serves  to

       (d)  what  requests  were  received  from  the  President  and  other
           Ministers concerned in respect of the JIT Report.


                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Budget Vote No 17 - Labour

The  MINISTER  OF  LABOUR:  Hon  members,  Deputy  Chairperson  or   is   it
Chairperson - well they change seats every now and  again.  Sekela  Sihlalo,
...  [Deputy  Chairperson,  ...]  allow  me  to  commence  my  address  from
borrowing a few lines  from  the  well-known  and  highly  esteemed  African
writer Ben Okri, who in his book A Way of Being Free, states the  following:



  The vast realities of our age are manufactured realities, it is therefore
  our task as creative participants in the universe to redream  our  world.
  The  fact  of  possessing  imagination  means  that  everything  can   be
  redreamed. Each reality can have  its  alternative  possibilities.  Human
  beings are blessed with a necessity of transformation.

Deputy Chairperson, it was the atrocious reality manufactured by  those  who
colonised us and subjected the majority of our people to horrendous acts  of
social oppression  and  economic  exploitation  that  the  founders  of  our
liberation movement, the  African  National  Congress,  sought  to  redress.
Indeed the pioneers of our struggle had an  alternative  dream  to  the  one
cherished by those who sought to rob  our  people  of  their  birthright  to
liberty and peace. They dreamt of denying  our  people  access  to  economic
opportunities  by  restricting  their  right  to  trade,  to  obtain  decent
education and training and to practise their trade of choice.

Incarceration, being forced into exile and the threat  of  death  could  not
suppress the dream or shatter  the  hope  of  creating  a  truly  nonracial,
nonsexist, democratic South Africa. The capacity of human beings to  redream
a new  and  different  reality  to  the  one  manufactured  and  imposed  by
detractors  and  an  inherent  ability  of  homo  sapiens  to  recreate  and
transform their reality in a manner contemplated by Ben  Okri,  was  clearly
demonstrated when freedom-loving South Africans, black  and  white,  marched
alongside each other and  gathered  47  years  ago  in  Kliptown,  south  of
Johannesburg, to constitute the  congress  of  the  people  that  adopted  a
charter in which they declared that South Africa belongs to all who live  in
it, black and white. The significance of this declaration was  that  it  was
not acceptable that the majority  of  the  population  of  South  Africa  be
relegated to the humiliating status of being regarded as sojourners  in  the
land of their birth.

As hon members would know, the Freedom Charter  further  declares  that  the
national wealth of our country shall be restored to  the  people;  that  all
people shall have equal rights to trade where they  choose,  to  manufacture
and enter all trades, crafts and professions. This was the dream dreamt  and
the hope harboured by the masses of our people assembled at the congress  of
the people in 1955. The people declared that on that day that all who  work,
shall be free to form trade unions, to elect their officers  and  make  wage
agreements with their employers.

The Congress of the People also demanded that  the  state  should  recognise
the right and duty of all to work and to draw  full  unemployment  benefits.
It declared that men and women of all races  shall  receive  equal  pay  for
equal work; that domestic  workers  and  farmworkers  shall  have  the  same
rights as all others who work. The congress  called  for  the  abolition  of
child labour  and  the  tot  system.  These  are  some  of  the  dreams  and
aspirations that all progressive South Africans gathered at the Congress  of
the People had in common.

Deputy Chairperson, it should also be  understood  that  while  millions  of
South Africans could not attend the congress in Kliptown,  they  shared  the
same dreams, the same hopes, the same aspirations. So those who gathered  in
Kliptown articulated the dreams of many other South Africans.

So determined were the delegates at the congress to realise this  dream  and
translate their hope into reality, that they  concluded  the  document  they
adopted with these words, and I quote: ``These freedoms we  will  fight  for
side by side throughout our lives until we have won our liberty.''

No better words would have demonstrated the determination of the  people  to
redream a new order and to transform our country into a broader society  for
all. The commitment to fight for these freedoms  was  not  inspired  by  the
desire for war. Our undertaking operations that made us live  side  by  side
with death was not inspired by a desire to be listed  in  history  books  as
martyrs. All of these were unselfish hopes and choices inspired by  a  dream
to be free and to free others. For that reason, no sacrifice was  considered
too high.

I find it interesting, Deputy Chairperson,  that  some  liberal  politicians
seemed to have shared some aspects of this dream in the early days. I  would
like to remind the members of the Democratic  Alliance  here  today  of  the
words of Dr Zach De Beer - in particular  new  members,  the  ones  who  are
going to follow me - of the then Progressive Federal Party in 1979, when  he
was speaking in this House against amendments to the second reading  of  the
Industrial Conciliation Act. In  endorsing  a  sentiment  from  the  Wiehahn
Commission to which amendments were responding, he said: ``The denial  of  a
fundamental right to  which  all  workers  should  be  entitled  is  morally
indefensible.''

I only wish that those who claim to have inherited and to be taking  forward
this liberal tradition were as principled today instead of telling  us  that
we must scrap the labour laws. Mrs Helen Suzman in the same debate spoke  of
the hopes that at last  the  workers  of  South  Africa  were  going  to  be
provided with a real charter of industrial freedom. But this was not  to  be
at that time. It is ironic, is it not, that  today  the  same  discourse  on
fundamental rights of vulnerable workers case the same freedoms  as  onerous
regulations which inhibit investment and job creation.

Mr Chair, having won political power, we owe it to all freedom-loving  South
Africans to use the might and the resources of the state  to  transform  our
society into one that truly cares for  its  people:  Be  it  those  who  are
forced to work long and unregulated hours  in  locked  up  sweat  shops;  or
those who only earn enough to pay for transport to go back to work the  next
day;  or  those  who  work  in  hazardous  conditions   without   protective
equipment; or  those  who  are  discriminated  against  in  their  workplace
because they are black, female, disabled or  are  HIV-positive,  or  because
they were prevented from obtaining skills that would enable them  to  depend
for their livelihood on full participation in productive  work;  or  because
they are school leavers who are unable to  obtain  employment  because  they
lack work experience; or they were  unfairly  dismissed;  or  casualised  by
their uncaring bosses; or are in need of financial  support  due  to  short-
term employment; or are in need of compensation for  injuries  sustained  at
work and diseases contracted in the call of  duty.  Chairperson,  those  are
the ones whose aspirations, needs and concerns my department is called  upon
to address in order to contribute  to  the  goal  of  the  movement  of  the
people, the ANC, of ensuring a better life for all.

Building on the policy framework developed during our first  five  years  of
democratic government and the work done in the  first  half  of  the  second
cycle of our democracy, the Department of Labour has made great  strides  in
realising  the  dreams,  fulfilling  the  hopes,  meeting  the   needs   and
addressing the concerns of those it is required  to  serve  with  the  money
voted to us by this Parliament.

Chairperson, during the year under review, we began vigorously to  implement
the amendments to the Basic Conditions of  Employment  Act  and  the  Labour
Relations Act aimed at improving the application of the labour  legislation,
ensuring the effective alignment  of  our  laws  with  the  changing  labour
market environment and increasing the sensitivity  of  our  legal  framework
with the imperative to create jobs and  addressing  unintended  consequences
of some of the provisions. As  a  result  of  these  amendments,  legitimate
workers  can  no  longer  be  reclassified  by  unscrupulous  employers   as
independent  contractors  to  render  them   ineligible   for   labour   law
protection.

Employers who intend to retrench workers can  no  longer  do  so  without  a
legally enforceable process  aimed  at  either  preventing  retrenchment  or
mitigating the effects thereof. The labour market is now more efficient  for
business  people,  especially  small  businesses,  to  take  care  of  their
business more effectively and with a greater degree of certainty.

Key  and  historic  sectoral  determinations  were  published  in  extremely
vulnerable  sectors  of  the  labour  market,  namely,  the   domestic   and
agricultural sectors respectively.  Each  of  the  determinations  prescribe
minimum wages and regulate service conditions and  thereby  give  effect  to
the dictum in the Freedom Charter that  states  that  domestic  workers  and
farmworkers shall have the same rights as all others who work.

The domestic work sectoral determination ensures that for the first time  in
the history of this country domestic workers are recognised as  workers  and
not just as  so-called  helpers.  Consequently  their  contribution  to  the
economy will no longer be undervalued. Implementation of these two  separate
determinations will ensure that the  level  of  abuse,  marginalisation  and
exploitation of vulnerable workers in  these  two  sectors  shall  become  a
thing of the past.

Chairperson, while the determination  for  domestic  workers  was  met  with
great enthusiasm by the majority of employers and workers, the  same  cannot
be said of some employers in the  agricultural  sector.  It  is  interesting
that the majority of black  farmers  represented  by  the  National  African
Farmers Association, most of whom, for historical reasons, are new  entrants
and therefore  not  well-off,  welcomed  this  initiative  as  an  important
instrument to prevent exploitation  of  workers.  On  the  other  hand  some
individual white farmers and  their  associations  are  tempted  to  wage  a
political battle against the determination. I think that they would like  to
be allowed to continue paying their workers in kind and  deduct  from  their
wages an amount in excess of the allowable  10%.  Acceding  to  that  demand
would not only have resulted in the Government  becoming  an  accomplice  in
entrenching the cycle of poverty  amongst  farmworkers  that  has  for  many
years been transmitted from one generation  to  the  next,  but  would  also
breed an environment wherein those  who  do  not  like  the  policies  of  a
democratically elected ANC  Government,  undermine  the  rule  of  law  with
impunity.

I  sincerely  hope  that  this  policy  aimed  at  eradicating  poverty  and
protecting the rights of vulnerable workers is not turned into a racial  and
political football. I would like to state without  equivocation  that  those
who think they can turn the clock back by putting political pressure  on  us
to stop the ANC's transformation agenda  have  undercalculated  our  resolve
and determination. To them I can only say:

Asijiki. Siya phambili, nokuba sekumnyam' entla. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [We are  not
turning back. We are moving forward no matter what. [Applause.]]

That the ANC has more than 90 years of experience in resistance we  have  to
remind people that:

I-ANC ngumbutho wabantu,  woxolo,  onjongo  yawo  ikukukhulula  abantu  beli
lizwe kumakhamandela  neenkxwaleko  zengcinezelo.  I-ANC  ayilelanga,  iguqe
ngamadolo. Ningayinyatheli emsileni. [The ANC is a people's organisation  of
peace, whose objective is to free people of this country from  the  shackles
and chains of struggle and oppression. The ANC is wide awake.  Do  not  dare
bother it.]

I-ANC  ayahlukanga  kumeva  etolofiya  xa  ingaphethwanga  ngobunono   ngabo
bayinyevulelayo. [Uwele-wele.] [The ANC is no different from the  thorns  of
the prickly pear if and when it is not handled with care by those who  sneer
at it. [Interjections.]]

However, in the interest of promoting peace  and  stability  in  the  labour
market, I have set up a task team consisting of officials of  my  department
and representatives of employers and unions to work  with  the  agricultural
sector  to  develop  a  programme  of  action  to  ensure   the   successful
implementation of the sectoral determination. Thus far not a  single  farmer
has  opposed  the  sectoral  determination;  they  are   complaining   about
implementation - some of them even before they implement.

Chairperson,  the  work  on  developing  the  comprehensive   programme   to
eradicate child labour, carried out in collaboration with  other  government
departments and civil society formations, is now at an  advanced  stage  and
is likely to be concluded during the financial year.

As hon members would know, my department has launched in the last  financial
year a code of good practice on disability following the  successful  launch
of a similar code on HIV/Aids. HIV/Aids, hon members,  is  a  challenge  for
all of us - one that we can overcome by working together in the  partnership
against Aids. The fight against the epidemic takes  place  on  many  fronts,
mostly out of the public eye. We need from time to time  to  bring  together
all that has been done so that all of us can know both that together we  are
making an impact and that now we must continue to intensify the campaign.

Our country has a comprehensive five-year HIV/Aids  and  STI  strategy  that
addresses  prevention,  treatment  and  care,  research  and  human   rights
aspects. It is founded on the premise that HIV causes Aids.

Since there is no known cure for Aids, prevention of HIV  infection  remains
critical. Government's pervention strategy is to promote  public  awareness,
to make condoms - Comrade Madasa, I'm calling you  ``comrade''  because  I'm
talking about condoms - widely available and to develop the life  skills  of
young people. I became a Christian before you repented. [Laughter.]

The Technical Assistance Guidelines that I launched on Monday 26 May  should
be seen in this context. The Technical Assistance  Guidelines  will  provide
support and guidance to employers in  the  implementation  of  the  HIV/Aids
code.

HIV/Aids and other diseases for that matter have  a  devastating  effect  on
all South African workplaces  and  the  economy.  Its  impact  can  be  seen
through an increase in absenteeism  and  sick  leave,  staff  turn-over  and
lower staff morale.

The Technical Assistance Guidelines are designed  as  an  accessible,  user-
friendly manual for employees, employers and trade unions  on  how  to  deal
with HIV-related discrimination and to respond to the impact of HIV/Aids  in
the workplace.

All these initiatives are aimed at preventing unfair discrimination  in  the
workplace.  However,  the  acid  test  on  whether  the  employment   equity
legislation is successfully being implemented will be when we  see  concrete
evidence of changes in the workplace. The recent report  of  the  Commission
for Employment Equity demonstrates that very little  is  happening  in  this
regard. While one may concede that the law is relatively  new  and  that  it
takes time to change  a  culture  that  has  been  entrenched  by  apartheid
policies over many years, the 1% increase in the number of blacks who  moved
to top management positions over  the  last  two  years  is  definitely  not
acceptable.

I have reasons to believe that  there  are  companies  that  are  intent  on
resisting workplace transformation. It is  therefore  my  intention  to  pay
particular attention to this in the next financial year. I also  await  with
keen interest the report of the findings of the portfolio committee  arising
from their recently held public hearings on employment equity.  Indeed  some
of the suggestions made by social partners and other stakeholders  may  help
us in ensuring that the dreams and aspirations  of  the  majority  of  South
Africans, as  declared  in  the  Freedom  Charter  and  articulated  in  our
Constitution, find practical expression in the workplace.

Kungoko sisitsho sisithi asijiki. Siya  phambili  nokuba  sekumnyam'  entla.
[That is why we maintain our stance and say we are not turning back. We  are
moving forward through thick and thin.]

It has become common knowledge that one  of  the  factors  constraining  our
economy from growing to optimal  levels,  from  attracting  foreign,  direct
investment and increasing  job  opportunities  is  the  skills  deficit  our
country inherited from the big-mouth members who are  sitting  on  my  left.
[Interjections.] Given the significance of this  matter,  my  department  is
confronting the issue head-on, as evidenced  by  the  fact  that  since  the
beginning of 2001 to date, a total of not less than 3,1 million people  have
received  training  relevant  to  their  work  or  relevant  to  trades  and
occupations they aspire to enter into.

Given the poor performance of some Setas  in  this  regard  and  the  strict
fiscal conditions under which grants must be disbursed, it is only fair  for
us to applaud this 250% improvement. Of course these  accolades  should  not
be seen as a cover-up for those Setas that are  underperforming.  While  the
majority of Setas are doing very well, it is  common  knowledge  that  there
are those few whose performance  is  so  dismal  as  to  besmirch  the  good
reputation and progress made by the rest.
My department has developed a programme of action to assist those Setas  who
are struggling. At the same time we are compiling legislation to be  brought
to Parliament soon, which we trust will go  a  long  way  in  improving  the
functioning and accountability of the Setas.

As regards learnerships, hon  members  will  remember  that  the  department
exceeded by far the 3 000 target that was set for the first intake  for  the
year 2000-01. It gives me pleasure to announce today that as at the  end  of
the financial year under review, a whopping total  of  23  517  people  were
already in learnerships, 8 159 of whom were unemployed young people.  If  we
add 17 735 people  engaged  in  apprenticeships  since  the  launch  of  the
strategy, it means that a total of 41 252 have  received  quality  training.
[Applause.]

Members will recall that last year we announced that  over  a  billion  rand
had been allocated to strategic projects being managed  by  18  Setas.  Time
does not permit a report on the progress of each of these, but  I  am  happy
to report that the project being managed by  the  Financial  Services  Seta,
Fasset, is galloping ahead.  Their  project  has  focused  on  the  training
carried out in promoting the learning and teaching  of  maths,  science  and
accounting. It has shown remarkable results, including the 84% pass rate  of
first year B Com students at The University of Fort Hare.

Training funded by the department through our provincial  offices  supported
the training of a total of 78 467 people, of which 48 119 were youth  and  2
504  were  people  with  disabilities.  About  3  265  scholars  were  given
bursaries to address the problem of scarce skills. Chairperson, an  analysis
of  these  figures  demonstrates  in  no  uncertain  terms  my  department's
overwhelming response to the President's call that our  country  should  act
decisively to increase the number of those who rely for their livelihood  on
participation in the economy.

Chairperson, one of the  plethora  of  hopes  the  people  who  gathered  in
Kliptown had, was that a day would come  when  the  consumer  of  government
service, the citizenry, especially black  citizens,  will  be  treated  with
dignity when they approach  Government  for  services.  Many  of  those  who
gathered at Kliptown to adopt the Freedom Charter may have already  departed
from their physical and mortal dwelling. But those who are still alive  will
be glad to know that my department has responded  to  a  call  to  make  the
department user-friendly. Pursuant to that objective we have  established  a
service delivery arm of the department under  the  leadership  of  a  Deputy
Director-General.

Therefore Chairperson, the praises we get will not cause us to rest  on  our
laurels with arrogance and complacency. At the same  time  the  constructive
criticism will only motivate us to spare no strength or effort  in  ensuring
that we give nothing but the best for our people. This is the least  we  can
do to show honour and reverence  to  many  of  those  who  have  made  great
sacrifices to procure the freedom and liberation of all South Africans.

The service delivery  branch  is  also  responsible  for  routine  workplace
inspections as well as blitz inspections aimed at  ensuring  that  employers
comply with labour legislation. It is heartening to announce that last  year
alone a total  of  87  815  inspections  were  carried  out  throughout  the
country.  Each  year  we  undertake  analysis  of  high  risk  sectors   and
geographic areas and develop a programme of action to remedy the problems.

Is it not an interesting observation that of all the  workplaces  inspected,
less than 7% were issued with  contravention  notices,  prohibition  notices
and compliance orders,  while  only  1%  of  cases  resulted  in  inspectors
recommending prosecution. This illustrious performance illustrates a  change
of culture.  While  in  previous  years  inspectors  found  high  levels  of
noncompliance, especially with occupational health and  safety  regulations,
the levels of compliance have  increase  significantly.  This  can  only  be
attributable to the fact that the vigilance of labour inspectors has sent  a
signal to the perennial violators of labour legislation  that  there  is  no
place to hide. And that is why we do want to repeat ...  [...  Asijiki  siya
phambili nokuba sekumnyam' entla. [We are moving forward no matter what.]

The new unemployment  legislation  aimed  at  overhauling  the  Unemployment
Insurance Fund was promulgated during the year under review. This  opened  a
new chapter in the history of the fund as unprecedented, bold and  ambitious
initiatives   were   introduced   to   address   the   historic,    systemic
inefficiencies that had plunged the fund into an economically  unsustainable
one with a deficit. As a result of these changes the liquidity and  solvency
of the fund has significantly improved and as at 8 May 2003 the fund  had  a
cash flow in excess of R2,7 billion.

The most progressive and radical provision of the new  legislation  was  the
extension of coverage to include the most vulnerable workers in  the  labour
market, domestic workers. Many arguments were advanced to persuade  the  ANC
Government to exclude this category of workers and treat them the  way  they
were treated by a regime  that  did  not  recognise  them  as  workers.  Key
amongst  the  reasons  advanced  for  their  exclusion  was  the  fact  that
extending  coverage  to   domestic   workers   would   put   an   inordinate
administrative burden on the infrastructure of the department.

While we agreed that  this  unprecedented,  progressive  intervention  would
place an enormous burden on us, we thought that  it  would  be  immoral  and
preposterous of us to exclude, from UIF coverage, those workers  who  needed
it most. Our only regret is that, notwithstanding the fact that the  Freedom
Charter had declared in 1955 that domestic workers  should  be  entitled  to
rights enjoyed by other workers, it took  47  years  before  they  could  be
registered with the Unemployment Insurance Fund.

Indeed this initiative poses challenges we have  never  experienced  before,
and indeed our systems and infrastructure  could  not  cope  with  the  last
minute rush by employers to register their workers. The  fact  that  we  now
have exceeded - in fact this morning I was informed  that  we  have  reached
the 400 000 mark of registration - the target by more than 33%  demonstrates
that even the unthinkable can  be  achieved  if  there  is  political  will,
commitment and dedication.

I know there are those who wish that I  would  become  harsh.  I  cannot  be
harsh on people who are complying with the law in the manner  that  many  of
the employers who are sitting in this august House have done.

Chairperson, let me also take this opportunity to  inform  this  House  that
the  nation  at  large  is  busy  with  preparations  for  the  Growth   and
Development Summit, which are on course.  The  premature  and  opportunistic
attack on the summit by the DA is at best  unfortunate  and  at  worst  ill-
conceived. To suggest that a summit, aimed at providing  an  opportunity  to
social partners to work together towards raising the rate of investment  and
growth in order to create more  employment  opportunities  and  address  the
legacy of development deficit, is simply a  talk  shop,  is  a  contemptuous
insult not only to the Government but also to organised labour, captains  of
industry and civil  society  formations  who  have  all  demonstrated  their
commitment to collaborate in addressing  our  painful  past,  which  if  not
addressed will continue to haunt many generations to come.

Only those who are not conversant with the  arrogance  of  the  DA  and  its
racist agenda will be flabbergasted  by  its  sustained  campaign  aimed  at
creating an impression that nothing plausible will ever come  from  a  black
government. In an attempt to obtain votes  from  victims  and  survivors  of
policies predicated on a theory of  white  supremacy,  the  DA  claims  that
South Africa is in a worse situation today than it was 10 years  ago.  Those
whose lives have been improved through the progressive policies of  the  ANC
will not believe this flagrantly irresponsible, naked lie.

The truth of the matter is that we have inherited an  economy  that  was  in
decline and destined to worsen. The truth of the matter is that our  country
was exposed to vicious, macroeconomic threats. The truth of  the  matter  is
that we have inherited structural unemployment. The truth of the  matter  is
that we have inherited a labour market with  a  large  supply  of  unskilled
workers and a short supply of skills. The truth of the  matter  is  that  we
have  inherited  a  labour  market  environment  characterised   by   racial
inequalities and deepening adversarialism. The truth of the matter  is  that
the ANC has developed and  implemented  policies  aimed  at  addressing  all
these historical problems. The truth of the matter is that the President  of
this country,  in  discussions  with  captains  of  industry  and  organised
labour, has agreed that Government cannot solve all these problems.

Let me conclude by saying...

...Kuninzi esikwenzileyo. Kusekuninzi nekusafuneka sikwenzile. Indlela  yona
isende ngaphambili. Kufuneka sizise  utshintsho  neenguqu  kwiindawo  abantu
abahlala  kuzo.  Indima  esele  siyihambile   iyabonakala.   Abo   banamehlo
bayabona.  UMayihlome  kaTshstwete  uyangqina   kwincwadi   yakhe   asandula
ukuyibhala Road from now.  Yiva  ndikucaphulele:  (Translation  of  isiXhosa
paragraph follows.)

[We have achieved a lot. There is still much that we must do.  The  road  is
long ahead of us. We must bring about change in  our  communities.  One  can
already see the results of our sweat. Those who have eyes can  see.  In  his
recently published book, The Road from Now, Mayihlome Tshwete asserts  that.
I quote:]


  Recollecting images of resting soldiers,
  As I look at faded pictures
  of those missing
  those who stood against the greatest opposition.
  Driven only by vision.


  My memory dwells on the moments of their lives
  When their actions gave the masses hope.
  I think of them, the dying breed
  forever grateful they were never silent.

He concludes by saying:


  Today, because of them,
  We can proudly say:
  "that's the way it was"
  Mayibuye! I-Afrika!
  Umhlaba ngowethu
  Ilizwe lelethu.
  [Let it come back! Africa!
  The land is ours
  The country is ours.]

[Applause.]

Mr M S MANIE: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, if we want  to  assess
what has been done to date since our democratic elections, we are  compelled
to take a few steps back in order to assess what the  democratic  Government
inherited, notably the very deep-rooted  levels  of  poverty  and  the  vast
inequalities. The ugly face  and  effects  of  apartheid  was  most  starkly
experienced in the workplace and the inhuman laws that  governed  it.  These
laws resulted in the black majority being largely unskilled  or  semiskilled
and employed at the lower levels in the workplace.

Over the past 10  years  our  primary  role  was  to  outlaw  all  forms  of
discrimination, develop a  strategy  to  ``upskill''  the  majority  of  the
labour force, bring the marginalised sectors  into  the  mainstream  of  our
economy and introduce measures to correct the inequalities of the past.

Because of job reservation we had a  very  skewed  distribution  of  skills,
almost exclusively white at the top and  almost  exclusively  black  at  the
lower  levels.  For  South  Africa  to  enter  the  global  market  and   be
competitive, with the vast majority of  its  people  unskilled,  required  a
comprehensive human resource development strategy.  The  skills  development
strategy of the Government should be seen against the backdrop of the  above
problems and I will be  the  first  to  admit  there  are  still  very  many
challenges ahead.

Our initial task was transforming the old training structures  and  creating
ones in all sectors with a clear mandate. The economy was  divided  into  25
sectors and a Sectoral Education Training Authority (Seta) was  successfully
established in each of these sectors. At the public hearings held on  skills
development it became clear that some Setas have made  remarkable  progress,
while others again were lagging very far behind.

The task of training and allocating it a position high up on the  agenda  is
the primary task of the employers. It appears as if there is still a lot  of
reluctance from many employers. They seem not to understand that the  skills
development will benefit them directly. The skills development  is  seen  by
some of them as a further tax burden only. A drastic change of  attitude  is
required  there.  Skills  are  linked  directly   to   competitiveness   and
productivity  and  it  holds  obvious  benefits  for  companies,  not   only
domestically, but also to position them to enter the export market.

The sectoral  determination  for  domestic  workers  to  determine  a  basic
minimum wage and basic, decent working conditions was  a  milestone  in  the
history of South Africa. This sector was particularly difficult to  regulate
because of the low level of organised labour,  as  well  as  the  fact  that
almost each worker has his or her own employer. From now on  a  contract  is
required between a domestic worker and employer. Domestic workers must  also
be registered with the UIF  and  the  Department  of  Labour.  For  sleep-in
domestic workers, decent accommodation must be supplied  and  no  deductions
can be made for food.

The registration of domestic workers for the UIF to date has been  far  from
perfect and many of the reasons cited why it will be difficult  to  register
these workers have been proven correct. But let us look at the  matter  from
the other side. The most vulnerable workers are also  now  able  to  benefit
from the UIF and have entrenched worker rights like  all  other  workers  in
our country.

A lot of  work  still  needs  to  be  done  to  ensure  that  these  workers
understand what their rights are, as  well  as  making  employers  aware  of
their new duties and responsibilities. On this issue we can all  feel  proud
that we have made significant progress  to  include  domestic  and  seasonal
workers  in  the  mainstream  of  our  labour  market.  They  are  not   the
stepchildren of South Africa anymore. To encourage all employers  to  comply
with the  registration  process  is  also  not  the  responsibility  of  the
department alone, but forms part of our collective responsibility.

Of the close to 1  million  domestic  workers,  470 000  have  already  been
registered. This is a fantastic achievement, considering the complexity  and
difficulties associated with this task.  And  the  Minister,  the  Director-
General and the people involved must be commended for having worked so  hard
to achieve this. [Applause.] If you  want  to  applaud,  applaud  with  some
vigour! [Laughter.] [Applause.] Thank you. Much better!

About farm and seasonal workers, this sector employs  more  than  a  million
workers. Regulating this sector, as contentious and contested  as  it  might
have been, was absolutely essential. Farmworkers were  generally  considered
as the possessions of the farmer who could just about  treat  them  as  they
wished in the past.

Chairperson, I agree, agriculture forms a vital part of our economy and  our
ability to feed ourselves as a nation. However,  for  us  to  have  accorded
agriculture its important status, we were compelled to  address  the  plight
of farmworkers. Farmworkers are the  ones  who  support  40%  of  all  rural
households. This sector employs some of the most  marginalised  and  poorest
in South African society. On a previous average of  R500  per  month,  these
people were sentenced to a lifetime of poverty. Some people  spend  R500  in
one night when they go out and eat at a restaurant. So  how  can  we  expect
workers to support their families on this amount?

Some  farmers  have  objected  strongly   to   aspects   of   the   sectoral
determinations, but these measures  have  given  farmworkers  their  dignity
back, so compliance is a must, it is not a  luxury.  Although  the  sectoral
determination for farmworkers is not the total answer, it at  least  laid  a
foundation to improve the minimum wage and the working conditions of one  of
the most vulnerable groups in our country. I commend the  Minister  and  his
department for taking these bold steps with regard  to  farm,  domestic  and
seasonal workers.
On the 13th and 14th of this month the portfolio committee conducted  public
hearings on employment equity.  The  absence  of  organised  labour  at  the
hearings was of great concern to the portfolio  committee,  because  at  the
hearings the crucial role of labour to drive the process came  through  from
various presentations.

The report from the Commission on Employment Equity  has  illustrated  three
things in a very unambiguous way: Firstly, that  a  great  reluctance  still
prevails to implement employment equity; secondly, that the pace  of  change
is unacceptably slow; and thirdly, that there are very many myths  projected
as the truth in the media amongst  the  general  public  when  it  comes  to
affirmative action.

Although employers have submitted their reports, it appears as  if  many  of
them  have  not  developed  company  policies  or  allocated  the   required
resources to implement the Act. Very few companies have  demonstrated  their
commitment and the profile of the workforce  remains  largely  the  same  as
before.
The information supplied to the committee at the hearings by the  Commission
on Employment Equity showed a mere 1% change from 2000 to 2001. At the  rate
of 1%, it will take us several decades to implement a 100% change  and  none
of us can wait so long to ensure that we actually have employment equity  on
the shop floor.

Chairperson, I would like to  remind  those  reluctant  employers  that  the
Government did not want to introduce  compulsory  quotas  at  the  beginning
when the legislation was being considered. It opted for  the  softer  option
of allowing employers to set their own targets  based  on  their  individual
and personal circumstances. Ten  years  into  our  democracy,  many  of  the
workplaces still have exactly the same face. Once again let  me  state  that
equal opportunity is not the same as affirmative action.  Equal  opportunity
only becomes applicable when we have a level playing field.

Employment equity structures, where  they  have  been  established,  are  so
underresourced and so low down the managerial hierarchy that they have  very
limited authority to impact on changing  the  workplace.  The  opponents  of
affirmative action have propagated the view that white  workers  lose  their
jobs, cannot get promotions and cannot  enter  the  job  market  because  of
their colour.  This  myth  was  emphatically  dispelled  by  the  statistics
supplied at the public hearings. A very strong view that was also  supported
by many others was that our skills development strategy, and  in  particular
the role of Setas, should be linked more directly to the  Employment  Equity
Act.

In its report to Parliament, the Portfolio Committee on Labour will  address
the question of whether stronger measures  indeed  need  to  be  considered,
because submitting reports amounts to very little.  Those  people  who  have
felt the brunt of discrimination in the past  had  great  expectations  that
the new Employment Equity Act would eradicate all  forms  of  discrimination
and  remove  the  imbalances  that  existed  in  the  workplace,  caused  by
apartheid.

In conclusion, let me say that everyone says that apartheid  was  wrong  and
we struggle to find people who supported apartheid and  who  voted  for  it.
So, if we all agree that apartheid was  wrong,  we  must  then  surely  also
agree that the Government's agenda of what it is trying to do is correct.

So, what is the DA doing when they are saying that they want to fight  back?
All they are fighting back against is affirmative action, they are  fighting
against the skills levy, they are  fighting  against  domestic  workers  and
farmworkers.  They,  in  fact,  only   want   to   bring   apartheid   back.
[Interjections.] [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Mr C R REDCLIFFE: Chairperson, as a constructive and responsible  opposition
we believe we should give credit where it is due  and,  therefore,  wish  to
commend the Department of Labour  for  the  turnaround  in  respect  of  UIF
contributions paid by employers since the SA Revenue Service  was  appointed
to do the collections. Allowing the fund to  register  a  surplus  of  R1,45
billion in 2002-03 is quite impressive. It is the first time in  many  years
that such a surplus has been realised, allowing a  substantial  decrease  in
the allocated transfer to the fund.

However, I want to say to the hon Minister that I wrote a letter to  him  on
7 May 2003 regarding the initial chaos around the registration  of  domestic
workers for UIF purposes and up to now still have not had the courtesy of  a
reply, never mind an acknowledgement. I find this quite appalling.

Apart from the other major challenges we face such as  crime  and  HIV/Aids,
unemployment is undoubtedly our single greatest challenge.  It  is  probably
not an exaggeration to say that this has become  a  national  crisis.  Among
South Africa's grave socioeconomic problems,  unemployment  is  one  of  the
most serious and intractable. It  is  the  greatest  single  cause  of  deep
poverty and has replaced race as the major  factor  in  inequality,  and  it
underlines or contributes to a wide range of other socioeconomic ills.

We can be proud of some achievements since the advent of our  democracy.  We
agree that good progress has been  made  in  stabilising  the  macroeconomy,
reducing inflation, reducing the  budget  deficit,  stabilising  the  fiscal
situation, relaxing exchange  controls,  liberalising  international  trade,
introducing a new skills development framework and  stabilising  the  labour
market. There is no doubt that these achievements have laid the basis for  a
more sustainable and higher economic growth platform for South Africa.  But,
South Africa's investment and growth rates remain  far  too  low  to  tackle
high unemployment and to raise the living standards of the majority  of  our
people.

The DA is unanimous  in  its  support  for  the  Government's  broad  macro-
economic policies, unlike the ANC which has such wide  divisions  about  the
policy. Incidentally, last week the hon Mike Tarr waxed  lyrical  about  the
success of the Government's macroeconomic policies. We can concur with  him,
but ask the hon Jeremy Cronin whether he shares that passion.
We cannot have political freedom without economic freedom.  We  cannot  have
the ballot without bread. Freedom is an indivisible concept. It is  probably
appropriate to misquote the  former  President  of  Ghana,  the  late  Kwame
Nkrumah, and we should  now  say:  "First  seek  the  economic  kingdom  and
thereafter everything will be added."

I believe it to be a truism that governments do not create wealth  and  only
consume it. It is business which creates  wealth,  and  it  has  no  colour.
Unless we seriously address unemployment,  rolling  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty, which is now becoming a hackneyed phrase of the  ANC,  will  be  an
elusive dream. The DA will attempt to make a constructive  contribution  and
put some concrete proposals on the table.

There are varied statistics about the levels of unemployment.  The  official
figure used by Nedlac in its last annual report, puts the figure  at  29,5%.
Others  put  the  figure  closer  to  40%.  Business  South  Africa,  in   a
presentation to the Portfolio Committee on Labour  last  week,  stated  that
7,6 million are unemployed.

I attended a presentation in 1997 in which Lawrence Schlemmer  and  Charisse
Levitz released a research publication about unemployment in  South  Africa.
In that they stated that:


  It seems fairly inevitable, therefore, that we will become more and  more
  clearly an enclaved economy in which the formal, unionised and relatively
  well-remunerated sectors of  the  economy,  while  producing  more,  will
  nevertheless shrink in relation to the overall labour force. The  pattern
  of a relatively privileged inner sector of the economy  surrounded  by  a
  vast and widening sea of unemployment and precarious marginal  employment
  is likely to threaten stability and  deepen  the  damage  to  the  social
  fabric which has already depressed confidence in this country.

That analysis, in my view, is still relevant. What are  the  impediments  we
need to address to get this  country  on  a  higher  growth  trajectory  and
consequently much lower levels of unemployment? We must accept  the  reality
that our domestic savings are far too low in  order  to  provide  the  fixed
investment and, therefore, foreign direct investment  is  critical  to  spur
growth. Unless the Growth and Development Summit seriously  deals  with  the
issue of the rigid regulatory framework and  labour and capital costs  which
hamper our FDI, we will not get this country on a higher growth trajectory.

The SMME sector has universally shown  to  be  the  biggest  contributor  in
creating jobs, as opposed to the large  corporations,  but  it  is  in  this
sector where many small employers find the existing labour  laws  difficult,
if not impossible, to comply with. And I differ with the hon  Minister  when
he says small and medium businesses do not find these labour laws onerous.

Some of the small and medium enterprises I spoke to say that labour laws  in
general impose a relatively higher cost on small firms than on  large  ones.
They also say that they are disadvantaged in  dealing  with  highly  trained
union officials whose skills are honed  in  negotiations  with  the  experts
employed by large corporations. Our labour laws  need  to  take  account  of
this, not only to provide  relief  to  small  firms,  but  to  increase  job
opportunities for the unemployed and allow the economy to grow faster.

Unlike  large  firms,  less  skilled  persons  look  to  small   firms   for
employment. These small firms  just  do  not  have  the  resources  to  have
personnel managers to evaluate prospective employees and are more likely  to
assess people by instinct. They function  on  a  hit-or-miss  or  trial-and-
error basis, hoping that the person  they  appoint  will  fit  the  job  and
handle it efficiently.

I am told that people with low skills are taken on  in  the  knowledge  that
they will have to be taught the job and may  initially  not  be  productive.
Small employers also hope, when they  appoint  people,  that  new  employees
will help increase the earnings of the business sufficiently to cover  their
wages. When this does not  happen  or  there  is  incompatibility  for  some
reason, employers are faced with having to dismiss the unsuitable  employee.
And this is the nightmare for the owners of the small and medium firms.

If one looks  at  the  number  of  the  cases  which  are  referred  to  the
Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, the  bulk  of  these
involve small businesses and most of these cases were for  allegedly  unfair
dismissals. In fact, for the year ending March 2001,  the  CCMA  dealt  with
over 103 000 cases, 16% up on the previous year.

These firms have to spend an inordinate amount of time and effort to  defend
these allegations. They also have to spend a  fortune  on  expensive  labour
lawyers, pushing up their overhead  costs.  They  simply  do  not  have  the
expertise or the resources to comply with all the regulations. Labour  costs
also constitute  a  major  cost  item  of  most  small  businesses  and  the
additional costs imposed by the new laws have led many small  businesses  to
curtail any additional labour intake. In many cases labour has  simply  been
shed. Some businesses have also closed down as a direct result of these  new
laws. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr R M MOROPA: Thank you, Chair. Chief, this person  that  has  just  spoken
now is fairly new in the portfolio committee, so he  could  only  afford  to
recycle the speech that was done last year by his party.

On 27 April 1994 the people of South Africa, black and white,  came  out  in
their numbers to take part  in  the  first  ever  nonracial  and  democratic
election. That onset of democracy in South  Africa  formally  ended  several
decades of colonial apartheid discriminatory policies and legislation  which
deeply affected the structure and efficiency of the  labour  market  in  our
country.

The legacy and apartheid practices remained and  are  continuously  attended
to by this Government. Our labour market reforms give grounds for  optimism.
Since 1994, with progressive  labour  market  policies,  we  have  seen  the
almost complete disappearance of illegal strikes and  plant  stoppages.  All
of this, together with other policy interventions, gives rise to a  positive
domestic economic outlook, which explains why South Africa stands out  as  a
success story.

Since then the Government, under the leadership of the  ANC,  has  engrossed
itself in an overarching goal of  creating  a  society  that  is  nonracial,
nonsexist and prosperous. It is trying so hard against huge  odds  to  push,
cajole and nudge the  cynics  in  the  direction  of  positive  struggle  to
achieve national democratic change, a course we have sworn never to  deviate
from. Indeed, the tide has turned against the legacy of apartheid.

The legacy of differences in human capital investment as well  as  in  other
individual attributes is playing a major  role  in  explaining  the  varying
incidences  of  unemployment  and  poverty,  and  the  racial   and   gender
inequality of labour in both access to occupation  and  incomes  within  the
South African labour market.

The year 2003 marked the  critical  phase  in  the  remaining  part  of  the
Department  of  Labour's  strategic  plan  that  has  always  served  as   a
management  tool  to  implement  the  department's  political   and   policy
mandates. Our strategic plan  has  drawn  its  policy  objectives  from  the
Ministry's 15-point programme of action, which was adopted at the  beginning
of the second part of our decade of governance and political  transformation
in the Republic of South Africa. At the core of  the  strategic  plan  is  a
clear   and   determined   shift   from   policy   formulation   to   policy
implementation. The President of the Republic made a clarion  call  when  he
stressed the need for the closure of  the  undesirable  gap  between  policy
formulation and policy implementation,  and  this  budget  adheres  to  this
call.

It is within this labour market environment that apartheid's most  draconian
laws and the application thereof suffered their worst failure, as they  were
based  on  inadequate  information,  defective  reasoning  and   unrealistic
assumptions. Most of the defective reasoning continues to inform the  Mickey
Mouse party's, the DA's, simplistic notion of the  characterisation  of  the
country's labour market. To avoid similar mistakes, the department  proposes
a scientific research programme in the budget on  co-operatives,  employment
creation  and  atypical  employment.  This  research  programme  is  a  huge
investment and it will increase the quality of policy  formulation  and  the
rate of successful policy implementation with less  impediments  to  service
delivery.

It should also be able to produce the synergistic factors required  to  pull
South Africans out of poverty during these nascent years of  our  democracy.
Although we celebrate the fact that associated  with  racist  labour  market
policies were some of  apartheid's  greatest  failures  and  defeats,  as  a
direct consequence of poor economic performance and the rise of  a  powerful
trade union movement, their legacy still constitutes  the  main  feature  of
many workplaces today.

It is against this backdrop that the  broad,  labour  market  transformation
policy objectives are consistently aiming at  replacing  the  policy  vacuum
that existed prior to 1994 with policies capable of removing  the  apartheid
labour  market  legacy;  addressing  the  challenges  of  unemployment   and
employment  poverty  rocking  the  lowest  echelons  of  our  labour  force;
mitigating the adversarial apartheid relations between labour and  business;
providing  resource  capacity  to  increase  levels  of   productivity   and
turnaround strategies for ailing businesses; pursuing  a  skills  revolution
on both managerial  and  technical  levels  required  to  drive  an  economy
increasingly open to  rigorous  tests  of  international  competition;  and,
lastly, providing remediation intervention to  those  whose  skills  do  not
meet the new skills demanded by the labour market now.

Guided by our Reconstruction and Development Programme, when  it  says  that
active  labour  market  policies,  productivity  enhancement  and  a  stable
macroeconomic  environment  are  key  mechanisms  for  meeting   the   RDP's
employment-related objectives'', it is within this  context  that  we  today
vote in favour of this budget which will give the Department of  Labour  the
necessary financial resources  to  accelerate  their  labour  market  reform
programmes.

The  policy  objectives  of  this  budget   have   been   consistent,   both
historically and contemporaneously, with the broad vision of  transformation
of the economy of South Africa. The inadequate and defective explanation  of
unemployment by the DA on  regulatory  policies  that  rigidify  the  labour
market and economy contributes negatively to  both  the  local  and  foreign
investment potential of our country. Flexibility  to  us  does  not  mean  a
euphemism for lower wages and management prerogative.  Rather,  it  means  a
multifaceted concept with labour market security  at  its  centre.  It  must
also be confirmed that job creation can  be  achieved  when  new  businesses
invest in the economy and old businesses expand their  investment  by  using
technology  that  employs  people  and  labour-intensive   techniques,   and
improving the skills levels of the people while they are employed.

The International Labour Organisation's report notes ``that changes in  work
organisation, work practices and technology have led to an increased  demand
for skilled workers in  both  developed  and  developing  economies''.  This
global trend of employing  higher-skilled  individuals,  when  coupled  with
South Africa's existing inequalities  in  access  to  education  and  skills
training, holds the potential to entrench and  deepen  existing  racial  and
gender labour market inequalities.

It is in this context that rigorous labour market  reforms  and  progressive
employment equity  measures  are  inescapably  valuable  tools  in  enabling
appropriate responses to an ever-globalising  and  unequal  economic  world.
Our democracy demands this.

The laws to support what I've said above are already in place and have  just
been reviewed in 2001 in response to the public  view  that  the  laws  were
achieving unintended consequences and we want to congratulate  the  Minister
in this regard for his decisive political leadership provided  when  it  was
so urgently needed.  [Applause.]  It  is  also  worth  mentioning  that  the
monumental role played by social partners within the Nedlac  institution  is
valuable.

These amendments sought to improve the application of both Acts, align  them
with the labour market realities and increase the sensitivity of  the  legal
framework. Since then the CCMA has experienced  an  improvement  in  dispute
settlement, both in terms of conciliation and arbitration.

Also of significant achievement is the passage of the UIF  Act,  Act  63  of
2001, which became effective on 1 April, as its objective was  to  turn  the
operation of the fund around by including the previously  excluded  and  the
most vulnerable workers, containing costs and enhancing compliance. We  also
want to commend the commissioner for a job well done and  we  hope  that  we
will sustain the type of positive cash flow that we are seeing today.

Thanks for the  amendments,  which  will  assist  us  in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty by breaking down the racial structure of poverty  which
persists both because of current discriminatory practices and because  steps
taken to redress the legacy of apartheid have thus  far  been  countervailed
by the ``Fight Back'' strategy of the DA as the opposition  in  this  House,
the negative outcomes of which  bear  most  heavily  on  the  poor  and  the
disempowered. And they will claim that they are representing the  poor,  and
I cannot understand why.

If we are to disentangle the poverty-stricken from  the  position  in  which
they  are,  and  from  which  they  cannot  escape  without  labour   market
developmental reforms that are currently being implemented, we must vote  in
favour of Budget  Vote  No  17.  These  achievements  so  far  give  us  the
ingredients for  faster  progress  on  this  particular  front.  However,  a
laudable achievement in itself, it has not  translated  into  the  increased
quality jobs intended by the labour market  and  economic  reforms.  We  are
under no illusion that the challenges are massive and  do  acknowledge  that
the  enterprise  of  national  democratic  transformation  is  in  itself  a
daunting task and a learning experience for all South Africans.
The investigative study under way into the forestry sector is a  major  step
in   the   right   direction,   in   particular    regarding    issues    of
contractorisation, which so far has achieved further marginalisation of  the
most vulnerable of our workers. We wait  in  suspense  for  the  status  quo
report in this regard. The reason for our scepticism  about  outsourcing  in
this sector is against the backdrop of what was experienced by  our  people.
This sector has a notorious record of replacing better-paying, more  secure,
formal jobs with primarily survivalist activities  with  very  low  incomes,
which creates an enabling environment for  poverty  to  deepen  amongst  the
already poor.

The National Productivity  Institute  is  an  irrefutable  champion  of  the
holistic, innovative and sustained development of South Africa's  productive
capacity.  Congratulations  to  the  chairperson  of  the  board,  Mr  Ketan
Lakhani, and executive director, Dr Yvonne Dladla, on their election as  the
president and secretary-general respectively on the  interim  board  of  the
Pan African Productivity Association, PAPA for short.
We salute these two South Africans for their role in taking a keen  interest
in areas of promoting  and  sharing  ideas  and  experience  on  strategies,
techniques and practices for productivity enhancement, accelerated  economic
growth and social development  on  the  African  continent.  You  have  just
started making your contribution to ensuring that this century is indeed  an
African century.

Since 1994 we  have  also  seen  the  achievement  of  a  dramatic  rise  in
productivity levels, as opposed to the two decades of stagnant or  declining
productivity  preceding  the  first  democratic  election.  The   programmes
embarked upon by the NPI involve  the  popular  social  plan  that  prevents
employment decline and ameliorates the impact of  job  loss  on  individuals
and communities. It will be proper to share some of the successes  that  the
NPI has scored during the period under review. Goodhope and  Don  Mines  was
faced with an economic downturn and was left with no option  other  than  to
dismiss workers on the grounds of operational requirements. The social  plan
of the NPI, with their turnaround strategy, stepped in and saved  124  jobs.
The role played by the union in  securing  an  investor  to  take  over  the
business in this regard was remarkable.

Women in rural areas, in partnership with South African  Breweries  and  the
NPI launched three productivity projects  as  follows:  one  project  called
Thuthukane women's project in Mpumalanga, the Basadi Ikageng project in  the
North West and the Tsoga a itirele project in Limpopo.  All  these  projects
are being carried out under the ANC Government.

In conclusion, more than just an economic  imperative,  the  deracialisation
and engendering of our economy is a moral requirement in  keeping  with  the
values and principles of equity enshrined in  our  Constitution.  Issues  of
women in the labour market are real structural issues of the economy  rather
than being residual.

Away from shop-floor benefits and employment, we are proud that millions  of
our people now have access to clean water, electricity, a  roof  over  their
heads, improved health and education. The communities of  Leroro,  Moremela,
Matibidi in Mpumalanga,  through  their  Motlatse  Forum  chairperson,  have
requested me to pay tribute to the Minister for  the  skills  they  acquired
from the Tourism, Hospitality and Sport  Education  and  Training  Authority
recently.  Due  to  organisational  commitments  I  missed  the   graduation
ceremony. Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Hon Chairman, hon colleagues, it is now an  accepted  fact
that at every budget debate, nearly every speaker has expressed  concern  at
the underfunding of the various portfolios by our Government. It is also  an
accepted fact that the previous system of apartheid is  the  main  cause  of
our present financial dilemma. Of course there are other reasons  pertaining
to this.

Frederick  Douglas,  that  black  American  slave,  wrote  during  the  18th
century:


   We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the  present
   and to the future. To all inspiring motives, to noble deeds which can  be
   gained from the past, our fathers and mothers have lived and died. And we
   who are left must carry the burdens of tomorrow.

It has become more and more clear even to the socialist supporters  that  it
is impossible to separate a policy on labour from  that  of  a  more  global
economic policy. It is no secret that globalisation, restructuring  and  the
fast changing world of work is bringing more and more  pressure  from  trade
unions than ever before. Thus, the clear message to both  trade  unions  and
businesses is adapt, be relevant and add value unless  you  want  to  die  a
slow death.

Our labour policy must be seen as a part of  a  more  generous  and  general
economic policy  -  the  one  which  emphasises  improvements  in  both  the
macroeconomic and the microeconomic environments. Such a policy or  policies
cannot be separated from the general economic policy of  any  polical  party
of the country.

The IFP still believes that the ideal labour policy  is  one  which  ensures
that the nation enjoys full  employment  and  price  stability.  It  is  the
obvious truth that all boats rise with the tide,  that  is,  a  nation  that
engages in solid, rational and workable solutions  is  bound  to  eventually
succeed. It is for this  reason  that  the  IFP  has  always  advocated  the
introduction of tax incentives in order to stimulate employment  growth  and
minimal interference by Government in business  and  labour  relations.  The
IFP has  always  advocated  the  introduction  of  more  and  more  taxation
benefits to the employers who establish and contribute to medical  aids  and
to the pensions and provident schemes of their employees.

We should further encourage farmers  who  provide  schooling  and  education
services and housing to  their  workers,  as  well  as  their  families,  by
granting them some form of tax relief as well. This  should  also  apply  to
farmers who provide  running  water  and  sanitation  facilities  for  their
workers and families. They should also be  granted  more  tax  relief.  This
will all help to boost our economy.
Whereas the IFP fully supports the  present  partnership  between  business,
labour and Government as exemplified by Nedlac, it is still  our  contention
that Government should assume a neutral position in labour  versus  business
discussions. Our further concern is that Nedlac has become a forum  for  big
businesses as well as big labour federations. This has resulted in the  fact
that smaller trade unions and smaller businesses are  not  being  adequately
represented. We have to address this problem in order to bring everybody  on
board.

Increases in the budget allocation  to  some  of  the  seven  department  of
labour programmes are  highly  appreciated  even  though  insufficient.  The
allocation of the employment and skills development service which  has  been
increased by R16,2 million is to be acknowledged. This programme focuses  on
the  implementation  of  the  National  Skills  Development   Strategy   and
contributes  to  the  implementation  of   the   National   Human   Resource
Development Strategy. However, we would have  appreciated  more  allocations
of funds to the Skills Delivery  Programme  as  this  is  a  programme  that
provides for the administration and the enforcement of labour laws  as  well
as employment services.

The answer should be delivery, and  more  delivery  through  enforcement  of
labour laws. This enforcement should  apply  more  so  to  the  occupational
health and safety of  workers.  Far  too  many  workers  are  still  getting
injured  or  die  due  to  improper  occupational  health  and   safety   at
workplaces. For all these reasons, besides all this, the IFP  supports  this
Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]

Ms H F MATLANYANE: Chairperson, employment is a focal pillar for social  and
economic transformation. Everything we do as a nation,  as  South  Africans,
revolves around us being able to create, and committed  to  creating  enough
employment. For poverty eradication, education and economic participation  -
local and global - job creation remains the most important priority  of  our
Government.

A job gives a person not only an income,  but  also  pride  and  respect  in
knowing that she or he has an opportunity to contribute to the  economy  and
participate in the growth and building of our nation. So, for us to  succeed
in feeding our nation, is to get South Africa working.  For  us  to  compete
globally, we need to create more jobs; we need  sustainable  and  productive
jobs. We need guidance and direction on the way forward.  We  need  a  long-
term solution to tackle, fight and erode unemployment.

Job losses is not a problem that started after  1994.  It  is  a  cumulative
problem we inherited from the previous political and economic policies.  The
Reynders Commission of Inquiry was  appointed  to  look  into  the  economic
decline in the early seventies. This shows to what  extent  we  inherited  a
mess as the ANC Government. The report notes that:


  The Commission is convinced that the problems facing South Africa in this
  external sector are more than cyclical or temporary ones;  they  are,  in
  fact, of a structural character,  although  temporary  factors  are  also
  having an effect on the situation.

Hon members can get the report  for  further  information.  High  population
growth, lack of skills and lack of real economic  growth  contributed  to  a
large extent.

Studies also point to an increase in levels of poverty and  inequality.  The
South African Human Rights Commission Report on Economic and  Social  Rights
- the Taylor Report - released last year, Statistics South Africa,  and  the
Idasa 2002 Afro Barometer all pointed out that the greatest concern was  the
high level of unemployment. We acknowledge the  fact  that  unemployment  is
too high; that not enough jobs are  being  created.  People  who  have  been
unemployed for a long time are no longer looking for employment. We need  to
bring hope back to our people by communicating  the  plans  that  Government
has for job creation. We need to identify areas that block job creation.

(Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, we need  to  develop  some  policies  that  would  ensure  job
creation. The solution to this problem requires the closer collaboration  of
each and every South African. We need to discuss with our people  out  there
what strategies we can put into place so that together  we  can  tackle  the
scourge of unemployment.  An  African  injunction  says:  United  we  stand,
divided we fall. For our country to develop and be  able  to  overcome  this
monster of joblessness, we need to strive for viable  economic  growth  that
is aimed at job creation. This is indeed a challenge that  faces  all  those
who are longing to make  South  Africa  a  success  story,  especially  with
regard to productivity, economic growth and job creation that will place  us
on a par with other progressive countries worldwide.]

South Africa has enjoyed eight  years  of  consecutive  economic  growth  as
significant achievements have been recorded  since  1994.  The  economy  has
experienced resilience in the face of several external shocks  and  positive
growth  is  forecast  for  2003.  What  needs  priority  attention  is   the
strengthening of the linkage between this growth  and  employment  creation,
poverty eradication and a marked reduction in  labour  market  inequalities.
In order to achieve this, we need policies that aim at  the  development  of
the economy, and that includes the ability to absorb labour that can  create
sustainable job opportunities, and to produce goods  and  services  of  high
quality.

To increase the demand for labour we need to raise  the  special  employment
programmes and the absorption capacity of the  economy.  Key  programmes  to
achieve  these  are:  the  Community-Based  Public  Works   Programme;   the
Municipal Infrastructure Programme; the Working  for  Water  programme;  and
clean cities, and land-care campaigns. We also need to preserve jobs in  the
private sector. We need to  promote  SMMEs.  Evidence  has  shown  that  the
labour absorption capacity of the small business sector is  as  high  as  in
other  developing  countries.  SMMEs  have  an  innovative   and   technical
contribution to make to the development of our country. The SMME sector  has
been identified as critical in achieving the goal of empowering  communities
historically oppressed by apartheid.

Small, black-owned businesses suffered various impediments under  apartheid,
and creating conditions for growth and  development  of  the  sector  is  an
important goal of the transformation of our country. The  small  and  medium
enterprises sector of the economy is thus important to the future  prospects
of our country, in terms of employment, growth, black economic  empowerment,
innovation and competitiveness.

The Jobs Summit of 1998 culminated in research that was done by  the  Labour
Market Commission of Inquiry.  The  report  noted  that  key  South  African
economic sectors have been subjected to the process  of  structural  changes
for some time. The Jobs Summit was  used  to  urge  Government,  labour  and
business to commit themselves to special partnerships in economic affairs.

There is a social plan that came after the Jobs Summit. The agreement  notes
that job growth and job creation are  urgent  priorities,  and  it  aims  to
avoid job losses and  an  employment  decline  wherever  possible.  It  also
envisages  support  for   communities   that   have   suffered   large-scale
retrenchment. This is spearheaded by the Ministry for Provincial  and  Local
Government  in  line  with  the   summit   agreement   on   local   economic
regeneration.  In  the  Mooi  River  local  authority  the   Department   of
Provincial  and  Local  Government,  the  Department  of  Labour   and   the
Provincial  Economic  Council  are  working   together   to   identify   new
opportunities for income generation.

[These efforts are aimed at poverty eradication and job creation.  Each  and
every one of us needs to ensure that South Africa has the  capacity  to  end
poverty. We are trying to show to what extent it would benefit us if we  all
stopped slinging mud at one another and  started  contributing  towards  our
economic development so as to ensure that ...]

We get South Africans working,  so  that  each  and  every  one  of  us  can
participate in ensuring that our people are employed.
The following structures were formed to oversee  the  programmes  that  were
agreed upon in the Jobs Summit. The Cabinet  Interministerial  Committee  is
chaired by the Minister of Labour - this is to ensure  that  the  agreements
reached are monitored and implemented. There is the Jobs Summit  Supervisory
Structure that was established. It consists  of  labour,  business  and  the
community constituency, established to review the progress.  The  Department
of Trade and Industry is responsible  for  integrated  provincial  projects.
The Department  of  Labour  is  responsible  for  managing  the  process  of
registering job sectors  and  also  enhancing  their  skills  to  match  new
opportunities.

The business community established a business trust that funded work in  the
education sector, as well as supporting growth in the  tourism  sector.  The
trade union movement formed the Job Creation Trust with a special  committee
to investigate specific criteria for project funding, and the  launching  of
those projects is expected to be this year.

In his state of the nation address, President Mbeki stated:


  Our country has a continuing task to push back the frontiers of  poverty,
  and to expand a better life for all. The challenges we all face as  South
  Africans, is to put our shoulders to the wheel to accelerate the pace  of
  change.

The purpose of the Growth and  Development  Summit  is  to  respond  to  the
President's  call.  The  much-awaited  Growth  and  Development  Summit   is
scheduled to be held early next month.

South Africa depends on human resources development  to  encourage  economic
growth.  Legislation  like  the  Skills  Development  Act  and  the   Skills
Development Levies Act  should  be  utilised  to  their  full  potential  to
improve  skills  among  the  population  in  the   workplace.   The   Skills
Development Act moves the country towards  building  real  skills,  and  the
Skills Development Levies Act funds the process  envisaged  by  the  former.
Moreover, these pieces of legislation should promote employability  for  the
population. One measure of  promoting  employability  is  to  focus  on  all
skills development areas, like science and technology. Chairperson, the  ANC
the supports the budget. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson,  Chris  lived  in  Kliptown,  where  the  historic
Freedom Charter was adopted. He was diagnosed with HIV and has  subsequently
passed on before he could reap the fruits envisaged by the Charter.  He  did
not receive any benefits from his employer while he was ill -  no  insurance
company would insure him, not even for a funeral policy. His wife and  three
minor children are destitute. Chris was one of the many  vulnerable  workers
in our country; somehow our system failed him. That is a stark reality.

I would like to see this budget make a serious  effort  in  protecting  such
vulnerable workers. I am aware that  the  Minister  launched  the  Technical
Assistance Guidelines. However, I would  like  the  Minister  to  provide  a
clear explanation of  what  the  exact  status  of  the  guidelines.  Is  it
enforceable in any way; if so, by whom? Or, is there an assumption that  all
employers will exercise their  social  conscience  and  act  humanely?  That
didn't happen in the case of Chris.

Chairperson, there are thousands of people like Chris. The question in  this
regard is: Does this budget in any way address the matter? In a question  to
the Minister of Health on 20  September  2002,  the  hon  Bakker  asked  the
Minister whether the  department  had  calculated  the  cost  in  the  South
African labour market of the loss  of  productivity  due  to  HIV/Aids.  Her
reply was that the Department of Health has not yet  quantified  the  fiscal
implications of HIV/Aids in the South African labour market.  Such  a  study
will require an intergovernmental approach. I would  like  the  Minister  of
Labour to provide us with a clear explanation of  how  he  intends  to  deal
with this matter, and whether or not this budget caters for any research  or
studies. HIV/Aids is having a huge impact on the labour market and  we  need
some clarity on the matter. If this budget does not cater  for  this  issue,
it is a matter of great concern.
Of all inspections that were carried out  by  the  department  during  2002,
about 9% of those were found to have contravened  labour  legislation.  This
is another area of concern to us, and  we  would  prefer  that  this  budget
ensures a greater allocation to this activity by the  department.  There  is
an increase in cases that are reported to the CCMA. What is even more of  an
issue are those employees that are unable to access a labour  centre,  where
they may be able to obtain assistance. The department should make a  greater
effort in ensuring compliance with labour legislation. Often  one  hears  of
driver fatigue with regard to road accidents.  The  Minister  should  ensure
that more inspections are carried out in transport companies.

The number of complaints to the CCMA by retail workers  has  increased,  and
together  with  the  security  industry,  this   constitutes   the   largest
percentage of complaints. It is therefore  imperative  that  the  department
reviews  its  inspection  methodology  and  rate  in  those  sectors.   Such
inspections must be intensified and increased in  frequency.  Clearly  these
economic  sectors  warrant  additional  attention.  We  would  like  to  see
occupational health  and  safety  receive  a  higher  budget  allocation  to
enhance its performance level.

Unemployment, HIV/Aids and poverty are a triad of issues that create  havoc,
and are steadily and surely breaking down the fabric  of  our  society.  The
task of dealing with unemployment is immense and once again a major  portion
of that task falls on your shoulders, hon Minister. The  triad  of  problems
affects all of Africa, and it does not help us in any way to find floods  of
people from all over  the  world  coming  into  South  Africa.  People  from
Eastern Europe, the Far East, Asia, and Africa arrive here on a daily  basis
- a tiny fraction enters the country legally, whilst a  huge  and  virtually
unknown number are here illegally. All the  major  cities  of  South  Africa
have an  influx  of  illegal  immigrants.  Our  social  services  are  being
stretched to  their  limits,  whilst  unemployed  and  poor  South  Africans
languish in rural areas. It is a national problem,  and  we  must  recognise
and take measures to manage it.
Hon Minister, one has to  find  solutions  to  unemployment  here  in  South
Africa, being mindful of the imperative issues regarding  Nepad.  A  balance
has to be created in this sector. Hopefully  when  Home  Affairs  begins  to
function in a better way, it will help regulate the  entry  of  people  into
the country. Both private and public sectors are shedding jobs.  Surely  the
time must be now for that to stop. Perhaps the Minister  can  also  indicate
whether or not his department has any plans  to  assist  the  Department  of
Education with career guidance in schools.  It  would  be  helpful  to  job-
seekers if they received additional advice from the  Department  of  Labour,
whilst completing  their  studies.  Some  Setas  have  accredited  community
organizations ... Thank you. [Time expired.]

Adv Z L MADASA: The question to be answered in this debate  is  whether  the
budget allocated has been  fully  utilised  for  the  stated  objectives  or
targets in the budget. Generally we know that the department has  done  well
but in future the budget ought to be laid for intended output in  accordance
with PFLA principles. Such an approach to budgeting will not only  help  the
department to measure its performance, but  also  the  portfolio  committee,
thereby enhancing accountability.

Despite  a  competent  restructuring  programme,  we  still  find   unfilled
vacancies. This is not good, especially in view of unemployment,  especially
in  the  Department  of  Labour.  If  these  vacancies  are  redundant,  the
department must say so. An important principle in lawmaking is the  doctrine
of effectiveness of legislation. The continued problems of  enforcement,  of
passed  laws  by  the  department  are  repugnant   to   the   doctrine   of
effectiveness. The department must attend to these difficulties urgently.

Lastly, the impact of minimum wages needs to be  carefully  looked  at  with
regard to emerging farmers and not so rich farmers. Despite that,  the  ACDP
supports the Budget Vote. Thank you.

Mr M J G MZONDEKI: Thank you Deputy Chair. It is important that as we  enter
this debate today we also reflect on the history  of  the  workers  of  this
country. It is important to reflect  on  this  history  because  it  is  the
history that will make us strive not to to go back to that situation  again.


I am talking about the history when  the  workers  had  no  rights  in  this
country. I am talking about the time when  there  was  nothing  wrong  about
employers not reporting accidents; nothing wrong about workers  not  getting
decent salaries; nothing wrong about not training  and  developing  workers.
There was nothing wrong about all  these  as  long  as  the  employers  made
enough profit for themselves and invested nothing in  their  workers.  There
was nothing wrong about unfair dismissals and  unfair  labour  practice.  It
was  not  uncommon  for  employers  to  instruct  employees  not  to  report
accidents because they would lose awards such as  accident-free  awards  and
bonuses.

It was these awards that enabled supervisors, then mainly  white  and  male,
to be considered for promotions. They were getting these promotions  because
they were deliberately misinforming the owners  of  the  companies  so  that
they  were  seen   as   efficient   managers   who   created   accident-free
environments. Some of  the  people  are  still  suffering  the  consequences
today.

Since the democratic dispensation when the people of this country  spoke  in
their majority and said the ANC shall govern, we have seen  drastic  changes
in the labour environment. We have legislation in  place  that  ensures  the
protection of workers. We have institutions such as the CCMA and the  labour
courts where workers can refer their cases for unfair labour  practices.  We
have ratified ILO conventions. Our workers can freely associate  and  belong
to unions in order to use their collective power to continue to fight for  a
better life and push back the frontiers of poverty.

In my debate today I will focus on two areas,  namely,  occupational  health
and safety as well as compensation. The Occupational Health  and  Safety  of
Persons Programme promotes the health and safety of people in the  workplace
through regulating the use of plant machinery and dangerous activities.  The
objective of this programme is to develop and force safety enhancing  labour
legislation in order to reduce occupational injuries and diseases.  The  ANC
welcomes the progressive increase to this programme which  will  enable  the
appointment of more inspectors and increase the capacity of  the  department
to carry out special investigations. We hope that through this programme  we
will see more blitz inspections at companies. Hon  Minister,  we  appreciate
the amount of work and commitment by your  department  to  reduce  workplace
accidents.

We also believe that through the  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Accord,
signed last year by the social partners, Government,  organised  labour  and
organised business, which embraces  the  principles  enshrined  in  the  ILO
convention 155 and 176, they will continue to commit themselves  to  working
together in the OHSA.

The second area I will discuss is compensation which falls under the  social
insurance programme. My other colleagues will talk  to  the  UIF.  Employees
sustaining  occupational  injuries  or  diseases  in  the  course  of  their
employment, are provided with compensation for such  disablement,  death  or
matters  connected  therewith  through  the  Compensation  for  Occupational
Injuries and Diseases Act, which is administered by the compensation fund.

The  question  I  want  to  raise  is  whether  employees   are   adequately
compensated for their injuries or death. Whether as a caring nation we  care
enough for those that through such disablement need more  specialised  care,
and whether we care sufficiently for dependants of those  that  die  in  the
course of duty.

Mponyana Mogeti is a contract worker in one of the Free State mines.  He  is
covered under COIDA and sustained his injuries in November  2002.  He  is  a
paraplegic, using a wheelchair. He comes  from  the  mountains  of  Lesotho.
When I visited him at the  hospital  in  April  this  year,  he  had  almost
finished his rehabilitation.

Mponyana had not received his payments for  three  months  at  the  time  of
visiting him. Mponyana had also indicated to his  rehabilitation  team  that
he  would  have  to  relocate  because  his  residence  in  Lesotho  is  not
accessible by wheelchair. Mponyana is therefore unable  to  visit  his  home
while he is still in rehabilitation because this is not provided for by  the
Act.

He relies on the mercy of his employer to decide whether he would make  such
a donation or not. Nothing compels the employer to assist, except out  of  a
sense of social responsibility.  Some  companies  have  a  policy  that  can
address such a problem. Others do not because nothing  compels  them.  I  do
not know whether we can say Mponyana is well cared for and  whether  we  can
say that he will be well compensated for his injuries. One thing is  certain
and that is that he has no guarantee of a job.

This is just but one of such cases that indicate a need  to  relook  at  our
compensation  system.  I  hope  that  as  we   engage   ourselves   in   the
comprehensive social security debate, we will be able to find  solutions  to
these problems.

During my visit to the constituency, the following  issues  were  raised  by
workers, medical staff  and  other  members  of  the  community.  Incomplete
accident  reports  by  employers  -  the  hospital  staff  state  that  some
employers bring blank accident forms because they do not know  how  to  fill
out these forms. Delays in the enquiries - they state that they get  delayed
responses from the officers or sometimes they get no answers at all.  Delays
in compensation payouts - sometimes these claims are  only  paid  out  after
the employee has already been discharged from  his  employ.  This  places  a
burden on the employee who wants to track or  trace  his  or  her  claim  by
either travelling to the hospital or to his place of employment.

The added  burden  is  that  such  a  person  is  not  earning  any  income.
Assessment queries - there are instances where the assessment panel  queried
a doctor's report and this causes  great  delays.  And  the  list  is  long.
Outpatients who need to be transported daily from work  to  hospital  seldom
arrive on time or regularly, which delays their recovery period.
The recommendations from constituencies to solve some of the  problems  were
that all labour centres be well-equipped to handle such claims;  that  there
is a need for company policies to be reviewed  to  ensure  that  they  cover
needs that are otherwise not covered under COIDA; that  the  employers  must
be educated to fill out accident reports correctly to avoid delays. This  is
a very strong appeal from the  constituencies  that  these  matters  receive
attention.

I know that there are many such problems that we come across in our  various
constituencies. But let me say that the  department  is  aware  of  some  of
these problems. Initiatives such  as  the  automation  of  the  compensation
system, the improvement of  the  ITC  system  and  the  decentralisation  of
claims enquiries to some labour centres are all aimed at  improving  service
delivery to injured workers.

The  ANC  strongly  believes  that  public  representatives   can   play   a
significant role in improving service delivery by taking  up  these  matters
consistently with the department or the officials concerned. They  can  also
play a role by conducting education campaigns  on  these  matters,  both  to
employers and employees, without undermining the role that the trade  unions
play. Our efforts will only enhance the  public  information  campaign  that
the department has already embarked upon.

The ANC supports this Budget Vote  and  believes  that  it  will  assist  in
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr P J GROENEWALD: Mnr die Voorsitter, die vraag is, wat is  die  taak  van
'n Minister van Arbeid? Die Minister van Arbeid moet toesien  dat  die  land
'n groeiende en tevrede werkerskorps het. Die vraag is, wat  is  die  rekord
van die agb Minister? Een toets vir die agb Minister is as ons  kyk  na  die
werkloosheidsyfer.

Kom ons kyk wat was die werklike werkloosheidsyfer die afgelope aantal  jare
onder die bestuur van die agb Minister. Volgens die eng  definisie  was  die
werkloosheidsyfer in September 2000 25,8%. In September 2001  styg  dit  tot
29,5% en in September 2002 tot 30,5%. Oor drie jaar is dit  'n  toename  van
ongeveer 5%,  en  dít  uit  'n  ekonomies  aktiewe  bevolking  van  ongeveer
18 miljoen mense.

As ons egter kyk na die breë definisie sien ons  die  werkloosheidsyfer  was
in September 2000 35,9%. In September 2002 eindig dit  op  41,8%.  Die  breë
definisie is meer van toepassing, want dit is mense  sonder  werk,  wat  net
nie  die  stappe  gedoen  het  om  werk  te   soek   nie.   Suid-Afrika   se
werkloosheidsyfer is in werklikheid dus ongeveer 42%.

Die vraag kan gevra word, vanwaar die hoë toename en hoekom  heers  daar  so
'n hoë werkloosheidsyfer in ons land? Die antwoord  is  baie  duidelik:  Ons
het 'n Minister van Arbeid wat meer begaan is  oor  partypolitieke  besluite
en nie bekommerd is oor die land en sy mense nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Die  agb
Minister stel wette op wat mense werkloos laat. 'n Tipiese voorbeeld is  die
minimum loon vir huiswerkers. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Volgens Statistiek SA het in die tydperk Februarie 2002 tot  September  2002
97 000  huiswerkers  hulle  werk  verloor.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Dit  was  die
tydperk waarin dit aangekondig is dat die agb Minister 'n minimum  loon  wil
instel.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die  instelling  van   'n   minimum   loon   vir
plaaswerkers moet nog verreken word. Aanduidings is dat tot 200 000  werkers
hulle werk daardeur  kan  verloor.  Hulle  kan  die  agb  Minister  daarvoor
bedank. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Nog  'n  goeie  voorbeeld  is  die  toepassing  van  regstellende   optrede.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Ek wil vir die agb Minister sê,  regstellende  optrede  is
niks anders as rassisme in die werkplek nie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dis  blatante
diskriminasie teen blanke mense.  Hoekom  sê  ek  so?  Die  topleerling  van
Gauteng in 2001, Riaan Lizamore, met 'n  gemiddeld  van  98,9%  kon  nie  'n
studiebeurs kry nie. Hy sê die meeste maatskappye se verweer  is  dat  hulle
nie beurse aan wit mans toeken nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Nog 'n voorbeeld is Dewald van den  Heever,  wat  11  onderskeidings  behaal
het, en ná 50 pogings nie 'n studiebeurs kon kry nie.  Volgens  hom  het  hy
meer as een keer gehoor: "Meneer, weet jy nie wat die  land  se  beleid  ten
opsigte van witmense is nie?" [Tussenwerpsels.] Die wette en die beleid  wat
die agb Minister van Arbeid instel, sê veral vir jong blankes hulle  is  nie
welkom in die arbeidsmark in Suid-Afrika nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek wil vir die agb Minister sê solank as wat hy voortgaan met sy houding  om
ANC-politieke beleid uit te voer en nie in belang van almal  in  Suid-Afrika
optree  nie,  sal  werkloosheid  bly  toeneem.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Die   agb
Minister dink hy verminder armoede, maar in werklikheid bevorder hy  armoede
deur te sorg dat mense hulle werk verloor.

My advies aan die  agb  Minister  is:  Hersien  u  arbeidswetgewing  om  dit
beleggingsvriendelik te maak en beleggers te lok om werk  te  skep.  Ek  wil
vir die agb Minister sê as hy nie beleggers in Suid-Afrika kry nie, as  daar
nie 'n behoorlike ekonomiese groei  is  nie,  en  as  hy  nie  ophou  om  te
diskrimineer teen blankes in die werkplek nie,  sal  daar  nie  werk  geskep
word nie en sal daar nie beleggers wees nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]

As daar genoeg werk is  vir  almal,  dan  sal  armoede  verminder.  Dan  sal
misdaad verminder. Dan is dit nie nodig vir regstellende optrede nie en  sal
lone van so 'n aard wees dat almal goed sal kan begin lewe in hierdie  land.
Dankie,  Voorsitter.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Mr P J GROENEWALD: Mr Chairperson, the question is, what  is  the  task  of
the Minister of Labour? The Minister of Labour  must  see  to  it  that  the
country has a growing and satisfied workers' corps. The  question  is,  what
is the record thus far of the hon Minister? One test for  the  hon  Minister
is to take a look at the unemployment rate.

Let us look at what the real unemployment  rate  was  during  the  past  few
years under the management of the hon  Minister.  According  to  the  narrow
definition the unemployment rate in September 2000 was 25,8%.  In  September
2001 it increased to 29,5% and in September 2002 to 30,5%.  In  three  years
it increased by approximately 5%,  and  that  from  an  economically  active
population with approximately 18 million people.

However, if we look at the broad definition we  see  that  the  unemployment
rate was 35,9% in September 2000. In September 2002 it ended at  41,8%.  The
broad definition is more relevant, because that refers  to  people  who  are
not employed, who not merely  took  the  steps  to  seek  employment.  South
Africa's unemployment rate, therefore, is in reality approximately 42%.

The question can be asked, where does this high increase emanate  from,  and
why does such a high unemployment rate reign in our country? The  answer  is
very clear: We have a Minister of Labour who is more concerned  with  party-
political decisions and who is not  concerned  about  the  country  and  its
people. [Interjections.] The hon Minister  drafts  legislation  that  leaves
people unemployed. A typical  example  is  the  minimum  wage  for  domestic
workers. [Interjections.]
According to Statistics SA, 97 000 domestic workers lost their work  in  the
period from February 2002 to September 2002. [Interjections.] This  was  the
period in which it was announced that the hon Minister wanted  to  implement
a minimum wage. [Interjections.] The implementation of a  minimum  wage  for
farmworkers must still be calculated. Indications are that  up  to  200  000
workers could lose their work because of this. They can thank  the  hon  the
Minister for this. [Interjections.]

Another  good  example  is  the  implementation   of   affirmative   action.
[Interjections.] I would like to say to the hon  Minister  that  affirmative
action is nothing more than racism in the workplace.  [Interjections.]  This
is blatant discrimination against white people. Why do I say this?  The  top
student of Gauteng in 2001, Riaan Lizamore, with an average of 98,9%,  could
not get a bursary. He says that the defence of most companies is  that  they
cannot award bursaries to white men. [Interjections.]

Another example is Dewald van den Heever, who achieved 11 distinctions,  and
after 50 attempts could not get a bursary. According to him he had  to  hear
more than once: ``Sir, do you not know what the  country's  policy  is  with
regard to white people?'' [Interjections.] The laws and the policy that  the
hon Minister of Labour implements states, especially to young  whites,  that
they are not welcome in the labour market in South Africa. [Interjections.]

I would like to say to the hon Minister that as long as  he  continues  with
his attitude to execute ANC political policies  and  does  not  act  in  the
interests  of  everyone  in  South  Africa,  unemployment   will   increase.
[Interjections.] The hon Minister thinks that he is  reducing  poverty,  but
in reality he is promoting  poverty  by  ensuring  that  people  lose  their
employment.

My advice to the hon Minister is: Review your labour legislation to make  it
investor-friendly and to attract investors to  create  employment.  I  would
like to say to the hon Minister that if he does  not  attract  investors  to
South Africa, if there is not proper economic growth, and  if  he  does  not
cease to discriminate against whites in the workplace, employment  will  not
be created and there will be no investors. [Interjections.]

If there is enough employment for everyone, then poverty  will  be  reduced.
Then crime will be reduced. Then it will not be  necessary  for  affirmative
action, and wages will be of such a nature that everyone  will  be  able  to
begin  to   live   well   in   this   country.   Thank   you.   Chairperson.
[Interjections.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Deputy Chairperson, one of the biggest  challenges  for
any government is the protection of workers from all kinds  of  exploitation
as well as health and safety issues  in  the  workplace.  Azapo  notes  with
appreciation that the protection of  workers  has  advanced  over  the  past
years, and that this has culminated in the determination  of  minimum  wages
both for domestic workers  and  farmworkers.  We  regard  this  act  by  the
department as a step that has made history for  the  vulnerable  workers  in
our country. [Interjections.]

The department has indeed brought dignity to those who for many  years  were
marginalised.  [Applause.]  The  dignity  and  self-worth  should   now   be
jealously guarded by all of us and mechanisms should be  found  to  make  it
easier for domestic wokers  and  farmworkers  to  challenge  dismissals  and
other forms of discrimination faster than at present.

As a former trade unionist, I know how  difficult  it  is  for  an  ordinary
worker to have his or her matter brought before the courts or  the  CCMA.  I
also know that many farmworkers and domestic workers do not belong to  trade
unions, and as a result they would not even  know  where  the  CCMA  offices
are. Therefore I urge the Government to do  something  about  this  so  that
they can get protection and get some help from those who have knowledge.

Reports in the media  have  indicated  that  farmers  as  well  as  domestic
workers' employers have in the past month dismissed  workers  on  the  basis
that the new regulation from the department  prescribe  salaries  that  they
cannot afford.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member, your speaking  time
has expired.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Oh no! [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson.  I  also  stand  here  today  as  a
former  trade  unionist  of  40   years'   standing.   Phansi   ngomzabalazo
wabasebenzi phansi! [Down with the labour struggle, down!]

HON MEMBERS: Phambili! [Forward!]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Phambili! Phansi-ke manje. [Now forward, this time!]

No more struggle; we're going  forward!  [Laughter.]  Is  there  a  need  to
mention how much poverty has eaten away at our society?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!
Miss S RAJBALLY: Poverty, starvation and unemployment Government strives  to
overcome.  Sustainable  development,  better  living  conditions  for   all,
employment and many more ideals are what we are striving to achieve.

This department has taken the horrific statistics  of  unemployment  and  is
correcting the injustice and inequality of the past regime  in  all  spheres
with regard to  colour,  sex,  through  job  creation  in  many  sustainable
developments and overcoming poverty. Unfortunately,  after  all  this  time,
poverty and unemployment is still rife and it is a duty ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order!

Miss S RAJBALLY: ... for Government and our people to overcome.

The MF strongly supports the vision and mission of the department  with  its
primary intention to encourage economic growth,  investment  and  employment
creation. A major factor that hinders employment is that more  than  50%  of
our citizenry is illiterate, and creating skills development is  very  hard,
but programmes have been introduced by the department, not only  to  promote
rising skills, but to institute equity.

Sound labour  relations,  respect  for  employment  standards  and  workers'
rights are all important factors in instituting a valid  system  of  labour.
What is more encouraging to note is that the  department  has,  through  its
programmes,  committed  itself  to  reducing   unemployment,   poverty   and
inequality.  The  determination  in  improving   economic   efficiency   and
productivity certainly is an asset in view of  the  global  advancement  and
standards. Through skills development there is a greater, more workable  and
stronger labour supply.

Eliminating inequality and discrimination in the  workplace  is  crucial  to
attaining equity in our community, and abiding by the Constitution  and  its
supremacy. Through creating more jobs there is an  increase  in  employment,
thus alleviating poverty.

Another factor that is pleasing is that the department is taking the  killer
epidemic HIV/Aids very seriously, and notes the serious  effect  it  has  on
our labour force and economy. Our hon Minister of Labour  has  ensured  that
the Technical Assistance Guidelines, TAG, on  HIV/Aids  and  employment  are
part of the department's programme. This strengthens  the  department  as  a
contributor in meeting the global and national challenge.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your speaking  time
has expired.

Miss S RAJBALLY: The MF supports Budget Vote No 17. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K MOONSAMY: Comrade Deputy Chairperson, Comrade Minister, Comrade  Deputy
Minister, hon members and comrades, I take  the  podium  to  support  Budget
Vote No 17. Comrade Deputy Chairperson, we continue to face many and  varied
challenges in bringing about much needed reform in the labour market. It  is
all too clear that even today the legacy  of  the  apartheid  labour  market
continues to weigh heavily on the workers of our country. Therefore,  as  we
look towards reinforcing the gains that we have  made  since  1994,  we  are
reminded, in the words of Comrade President, of our "continual task to  push
back the frontiers of poverty and expand access to a better life for all".

Here, as the ANC, we are acutely aware  that  securing  the  rights  of  all
workers is vital to achieving this better life for  all.  Some  of  our  key
challenges remain therefore to addressing  high  unemployment  rates,  work-
based inequality and  discrimination  and  the  exploitation  of  vulnerable
workers in the labour market.

Comrade Deputy Chairperson, it is the last two of these points that  I  wish
to deal with, employment equity and  protecting  the  rights  of  vulnerable
workers through sectoral determinations for the  domestic  and  agricultural
sectors. The  Employment  Equity  Act  of  1998  is  the  primary  tool  for
advancing constitutional rights to equality in the labour  market.  That  we
were able to steer the Act  through  Parliament  despite  strong  resistance
from opposition parties constitutes a significant victory for  the  majority
of this country. It is also a testament to the ANC's  commitment  to  ensure
that there is redress for past discrimination. We must be  mindful  that  we
will be called on time and again to defend this gain. On this note  we  must
challenge very rigorously any  misconceptions  that  employment  equity  and
affirmative action is job reservation.

The Employment Equity Act has been in operation for almost  four  years.  We
now have the benefit of the analysis of  the  first  two  Employment  Equity
Registry Reports, which provide data based on the employment equity  reports
submitted by designated employers for 2000 and 2001. It is,  therefore,  now
opportune for us to review the progress made thus far in implementation.

The reports by the Commission for  Employment  Equity  indicate  that  while
some progress has been made, the  pace  has  been  very  slow.  We  need  to
intensify our efforts to ensure that workplaces in our country become  truly
representative across all occupations, levels and sectors.  There  is  still
clear racial and gender stratification in the workplace, with  black  people
and  women  still  being  underrepresented  in  top  and  senior  management
positions. Employers are giving far too little attention to  employees  with
disabilities, with representation being low across all occupational levels.

For those who have been complying with the spirit of the  Employment  Equity
Act, they are symbols of what is possible  by  responsible  employers  in  a
postapartheid labour market. However, the many  others  who  see  employment
equity as an unnecessary operational cost and  not  their  moral  duty,  see
barriers  where  there  should  be  opportunities.  Complaints   about   the
unavailability of skills and poaching of employees  from  designated  groups
reflect  a  lack  of  commitment  to  implementing  our  skills  development
legislative framework, which would enable and support the implementation  of
the Employment Equity Act.

Here we are reminded  of  the  resistance  we  encountered  in  the  process
leading to the enactment of the Employment Equity  Act.  Therefore,  as  the
ANC, we are not surprised by the resistance we now experience,  and  are  in
fact emboldened to intensify  our  efforts  to  ensure  the  realisation  of
equity, and thereby increase the democratisation of the workplace.

Comrade  Deputy  Chairperson,  let  us  now  deal  with  unequal  employment
relations of a different kind. The labour market that we inherited  reflects
that  inequality  is  deeply  structural  in  nature,  with   black   people
concentrated in unskilled and semiskilled positions. Here,  notions  of  the
meaning of ``skilled'' has undoubtedly been influenced by our  racist  past,
with  those  occupations  that  are  associated  with  black  people   being
considered of lower  value  and  therefore  deserving  of  minimal  pay  and
benefits.  This  has  resulted  in  the  super  exploitation  of  the   most
vulnerable workers, being domestic workers and farmworkers.  Nearly  10%  of
all  South  African  workers  are  domestic  workers,  with  domestic   work
constituting the single most important form of  paid  employment  for  black
women. However, after farmworkers it is  the  lowest  paid.  With  increased
shedding in the  agricultural  sector  the  picture  currently  is  unclear.
However, until recently agricultural employment constituted 11,4%  of  South
Africa's total formal employment.

These  figures  illustrate  that  reform  within  these  two  sectors   will
contribute  substantially  to  the  overall  transformation  of  the  labour
market.  However,  virtually  every  other  day   there   are   reports   of
maltreatment and physical abuse. We often hear about farmworkers being  paid
slave wages of as little as R100 per month and that they  are  subjected  to
unacceptable working and living conditions. Occupational health  obligations
are severely neglected, with workers not being informed  or  too  afraid  to
complain. In both sectors workers are often required to  work  longer  hours
than the legal limit with no compensation for overtime and are  not  granted
paid annual leave.

According to a recent report in the City Press an employer deducted  R1  200
from a domestic worker's salary of R1 400 for allegedly poisoning  her  dog.
These are only some of the wide range of abuses that  domestic  workers  and
farmworkers are subjected to.  Surely,  then,  one  of  the  most  important
achievements over the past twelve months in the labour market has  been  the
bringing into law of the sectoral determinations for  the  agricultural  and
domestic  sectors.  Added  to  this  is  the  recent  introduction  of   the
Unemployment Insurance Act's application to seasonal and  domestic  workers,
which constitutes a major step towards addressing the conditions in both  of
these vulnerable sectors of employment. Together with the  Basic  Conditions
of Employment Act and the Skills Development Act, we can only  come  to  the
conclusion  that  we  have  transformed  the   labour   landscape   of   the
agricultural and domestic sectors and have begun to meet the  long  standing
plight of these workers for recognition and at least a minimum wage.

Our key concern has to be to ensure that all  employers  understand  why  we
have intervened in the way we have in these  vulnerable  sectors,  and  that
they adhere to the legislation  and  follow  procedures  where  difficulties
arise. Secondly, that we not only retain the existing employment  levels  in
these sectors,  but  make  use  of  the  Skills  Development  Act  in  these
vulnerable sectors to ensure the creation of new  employment  opportunities.
For those employers who have registered their domestic workers and  who  are
paying the prescribed minimums, they are  an  example  of  a  shift  in  the
mindset that has dominated  this  sector  for  centuries  in  this  country,
starting with the arrival of colonialism on our shores.

Our philosophy which underpins declaring specific sectors as vulnerable,  is
rooted in the philosophy that guided the drafting of  our  Constitution.  In
this the Bill of Rights is fundamental and therefore any part of the  labour
market which is not in line with the Bill of Rights must  by  definition  be
transformed through the mechanism of  sectoral  determination.  No  one  can
deny  that  both  agricultural  and  domestic  sectors  have  been   totally
undervalued in terms of their  contribution  to  the  GDP  of  our  country.
Though marginalised for so long,  they  have  made  a  contribution  to  the
running of our economy in a manner that is yet to be measured.

What we have achieved through sectoral  determination  of  these  vulnerable
sectors  is  to  challenge  the  isolation,  invisibility,  low  levels   of
organisation, unequal power relations and highly  individualised  employment
relations. In addition, with over 930 000 agricultural workers and  800  000
domestic workers, regulation of these  sectors  is  an  act  of  responsible
governance. The reality that we have to face up to  is  one  in  which  most
employers  have  disregarded  the  Basic  Conditions  of   Employment   Act,
especially on overtime  pay,  Sunday  pay  and  the  continued  practice  of
payment in kind which makes it difficult to determine the monetary value  of
this when trying to set norms and standards in the vulnerable sectors.  Very
often benefits such as food, clothes, medical  assistance,  where  provided,
are more often than not provided free  of  charge.  However,  no  conclusive
proof can be found that lower wages are  paid  in  lieu  of  such  benefits.
Farmworkers are the worst paid sector workers.

Comrade Deputy Chairperson, let us deal with the negative reaction that  has
come from certain quarters over  the  sectoral  determinations.  In  setting
minimums in these two  vulnerable  sectors  we  have  had  to  take  a  very
considered approach, namely, the needs of domestic  workers  and  employers;
the impact of minimum wages on poverty alleviation; the  impact  of  minimum
wages on employment creation; and the wage levels that existed.  The  impact
of the new labour  laws  since  1994  has  not  had  a  negative  impact  on
employment levels and therefore it  clearly  shows  the  need  for  existing
employment levels to be increased. However,  we  are  now  confronted  by  a
series of threats and in many cases actual loss of employment.

Comrade  Deputy  Chairperson,  what  we  cannot  accept  is  a  practice  of
circumvention and conscious avoidance of legal  responsibility.  In  setting
out  sectoral  determinations  we  are  testing  our   humaneness   in   the
improvement of the living standards of the most  exploited  workers  in  our
society. Urban and rural differentials have been  taken  into  account  when
setting minimum wages. Here the hon Minister of Labour  has  indicated  that
the two differentials, R650 and R800, have been deliberately set low.

These therefore, do not constitute a minimum living wage. Where  even  these
low minima pose a  danger  of  seriously  either  bankrupting  a  particular
business in the agricultural sector or seriously  impoverishing  a  domestic
employer, the sectoral determination provided for individuals to  apply  for
exemption. Nothing could be fairer than this. Whilst many have  complied  in
the spirit in which the sectoral determination was  passed,  we  have  those
who have indulged in conduct that indicates that we have a long  way  to  go
in changing the mindset in these sectors. In the  domestic  sector  we  have
cases where employers have sacked workers and  recruited  new  workers  from
mushrooming employment agencies in this sector.

In the agricultural sector workers are being  sacked  whilst  farmers  claim
that they can't afford to employ, even though provision has  been  made  for
exemption in the case of hardship. What is worse is  that  we  now  have  to
contend with groups of farmers legally challenging the  Ministry  of  Labour
through their lawyers in open disregard of the fact  that  all  applications
have to be received individually.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member your  speaking  time
has expired.

Mr K MOONSAMY: Comrade Chairperson, thank you. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Moonsamy, I can give you a tip: 150 words  per  minute  and
you will make it.

Chairperson, The Employment Equity Act and the Promotion of Equality Act  of
2000 clearly stipulates that disabled people  are  part  of  the  designated
group  intended  to  benefit  from  affirmative  action.  No  part  of   the
Employment Equity Act stipulates that handicapped or  disabled  persons  are
less entitled to affirmative action treatment than other  groups.  But,  hon
Minister, practically all South Africans with  disabilities  are  unemployed
and the few who are fortunate enough to  be  employed,  do  not  succeed  in
achieving higher positions.

When all these factors are considered, it should be obvious that this  group
needs the highest level of official intervention,  since  they  are  in  the
most disadvantaged position  of  all  the  designated  population  segments.
Whereas black people and women are historically disadvantaged,  people  with
disabilities are both historically and currently disadvantaged.

The Department of Labour only incidentally refers  to  disabled  persons  in
its report from the Commission for Employment Equity.  The  main  thrust  is
clearly aimed at black people and, to a lesser extent, women. There is  even
an admission  in  that  report  that  no  progress  has  been  made  in  the
employment of disabled people.

In the Department of Labour's Green Paper  on  Inequalities  in  the  Labour
Market, it is stated  that  only  one  in  every  100  disabled  persons  is
employed in the formal labour market.

Hon Minister, the question is, is  Government  paying  lip  service  to  the
promotion of this designated group? Is the inclusion of disabled persons  in
the definition of designated  groups  only  a  decoy  to  soften  resistance
against the real intention of the relevant  laws,  namely,  reversed  racial
discrimination?

That brings me to the crucial matter of affirmative action.  The  hon  Manie
said ...

Hy sê ons jaag spoke op; kyk na die syfers, hoe baie wit  mense  is  nog  in
die werk. Maar in dieselfde asem sê hy daardie syfers  moet  omgekeer  word;
dit moet totaal verander word. [He says we are invoking  spectres;  look  at
the figures, how many white people  are  still  working.  But  in  the  same
breath he says those figures must be turned around;  they  must  be  changed
totally.]

One of the stated aims of the Employment Equity  Act  is  to  transform  the
workforce of South Africa to such an extent that it will  be  representative
of the demographics of the population. What is the impact of this aim?

En hier gee ek graag erkenning aan mnr Dirk  Hermann  van  Solidariteit  vir
die volgende inligting. [And here I take pleasure in acknowledging  Mr  Dirk
Hermann of solidarity for the following information.]

Using information from Statistics SA's 1996 Census, it was  determined  that
whites form 12,2% of South Africa's population between the ages  of  15  and
65, the potentially economically active age group.

According to the aim of the Act, whites should thus constitute 12,2% of  the
workforce, while at present 20,4% of the force  is  white.  This  implies  a
surplus of 750 000 whites in the labour  market,  if  measured  against  the
ultimate aim of the Act. In terms  of  the  Act  this  imbalance  should  be
corrected.  The  question  is  how  it  can  happen  without  discriminating
unfairly against whites and without creating a new disadvantaged  community.
The best way would be for the  economy  to  grow  to  such  an  extent  that
thousands of job opportunities can be created.  Unfortunately  our  economic
growth is lower than the population growth, making this impossible.

The only remaining option to meet the demands of the Act, is to replace  the
750 000 whites with blacks. Even if the decision  is  made  not  to  dismiss
whites, but to wait for the normal processes of resignation and  retirement,
it will take, according to Dr Louis Botma of Free State  University,  up  to
30 years. The aim of the Act could therefore have dire consequences for  all
young whites trying to enter the labour market over the next 30 years.

Hon Minister, can you answer this question today, once and for all: Are  you
going to revise this aim  of  the  Act?  Is  this  part  of  the  unforeseen
consequences of the labour policy that should  be  revised?  Or  must  white
South Africans accept the reality that they are  overstocked?  Can  you  say
yes, with 750 000 in the labour market and that this figure is to be  worked
off in future? If so, what is your government's  plan  with  these  750  000
whites whom you so often call part  of  the  people  to  whom  South  Africa
belongs? I thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Order! Hon member, your speaking time has expired.

Mr C M LOWE: I have limited time  at  my  disposal,  Minister,  therefore  I
shall be direct and to the point. Forgive me, I shall also be blunt.

Your department faces a labour crisis of epic proportions  with  the  latest
unemployment statistics and  jobless  situation  a  shameful  and  appalling
indictment of the ANC's failure to deliver on the one thing it  promised  so
vehemently to do: To provide jobs.  While  that  great  liar,  Yengeni,  has
gone, the same cannot, unfortunately,  be  said  of  that  other  ANC  false
promise about jobs.

As you know, Minister, there are no new jobs. Frankly, like the much  talked
of, often promised, but seldom seen  growth  rates  and  moral  regeneration
campaign, jobs too have failed to materialise under an ANC regime  hell-bent
on control at any cost; choosing dogma over doing well;  inflexibility  over
investment; ensuring  that  they  flail  about  in  the  murky  darkness  of
joblessness -  unsure, unwilling and unable.

For a party that claims unashamedly to represent the poor, to speak for  the
disadvantaged, to defend the weak and  deliver  the  services,  the  reality
must be truly hard to bear. After nearly a decade of the  ANC  rolling  back
the frontiers of poverty, we  have  1  million  jobs  lost  and  nearly  42%
unemployed - and those figures are not from Stats  SA,  so  we  can  believe
them! One in every three South Africans, over 7 million  people,  is  either
looking for a job or has given up looking ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON: Order! Order!

Mr C M LOWE: ... realising that they are not going to find a job.

And  how  has  Government  met  this  jobs  crisis,  our  country's  gravest
challenge? Not by making investment and growth its single-minded  obsession,
but by being arrogant, intransigent, more inflexible; by  blaming  everybody
- anybody but itself; by looking backward and blaming the past,  instead  of
looking forward  and  embracing  the  future;  and  because  of  its  rigid,
inflexible, stupid and draconian labour legislation.

How dare you talk of a better life for all, Minister, when 7 million of  our
people cannot find a job?

Instead of listening to sound advice  from  various  quarters  and  amending
your draconian labour legislation and abolishing exchange control,  both  of
which will kick-start  new  job  opportunities,  Government  tries  to  keep
awkward topics like Gear and HIV/Aids off next months's  Growth  Summit  and
allows the ANC/NNP controlled Cape Town  metropole  to  racially  reallocate
thousands of posts for other population groups, so that thousands  of  black
and coloured male unskilled workers will lose their positions and  join  the
40% plus unemployed, while white men and women and  coloured  women  replace
them in a piece  of  social  engineering  so  bizarre  that  it  belongs  in
apartheid utopia. Not only does the ANC  not  know  what  to  do  about  the
mounting jobs crisis but, by their words and actions,  they  simply  do  not
give a damn.

In contrast, the  DA  believes  that  unemployment  is  the  worst  possible
working condition, and addressing this  should  be  our  nation's  priority.
This starts, Minister, with amending inflexible and impractical labour  laws
to encourage employers to take on new hands - not to do everything to  avoid
taking them on.

A departmental slogan outside today reads "Changes that improve the law  for
everyone-!" But they do not. The problem is that not everyone  is  employed.
In fact, nearly half of all South Africans do not  have  a  job.  And  until
these changes apply to them, until they have the security  and  the  dignity
of a job, that legislation will remain meaningless.  And  so  too  will  the
ANC's promise of a job. I thank you.

Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Mr Deputy  Chairman.  I  shall  not  use  any  party
propaganda, but I would  like  to  discuss  the  state  of  labour  in  this
country, based on an article in the Sunday Times on Sunday.

The past nine years have been marked by the  transformation  of  the  labour
market through the introduction of laws such as the  Labour  Relations  Act,
the Basic Conditions of Employment Act and the Skills Development Act.

Such laws are helping to redress imbalances caused  by  apartheid  policies,
while  ensuring  an  improvement  in  working  conditions  and  the  general
standard of living for many workers. Nowhere else in the world today do  you
find such impressive labour legislation. The labour laws are being  reversed
in Western countries and they have never even  existed  in  many  developing
countries.

Away from the shop floor, workers have  also  benefited  from  many  of  the
government's  service-delivery  programmes  aimed  at  uplifting  the  poor.
Millions now have access to clean,  running  water  and  electricity,  roofs
over their heads and improved access to education and health. [Applause.]

The  International  Monetary  Fund  has  praised  South  Africa's   economic
management, saying the country was poised to achieve three percent  economic
growth in 2003. During the  year  under  review  revenue  collections  over-
performed, expenditure management was enhanced  by  new  legislation  and  a
lower-than-budgeted deficit was recorded due to robust economic growth.

The IMF - not the political party - report  also  noted  conditions  in  the
labour market improved with the introduction of  legislation  to  streamline
the arbitration process and to allow for more flexibility in employment.

But, colleagues, according to Statistics SA, joblessness rose  from  15%  of
the past five years of the labour force to over 30% by September last  year.
The number of unemployed has doubled to more than four  million.  These  are
conservative figures and exclude unemployed individuals who  have  been  too
discouraged to look for jobs. If they were included, the  number  of  people
without jobs would have ran to about seven million.

Job losses in  traditional  union  strongholds  such  as  manufacturing  and
mining are in line with the global trends - not  a  unique  thing  to  South
Africa. They result from the new realities of  globalisation  where  labour-
intensive industries are declining.

Minister, jobs are being created in the informal sector and by SMMEs in  the
formal sector. Government must thus investigate and  find  out  what  is  it
that Government needs to do to  create  jobs  and  an  enabling  environment
where more jobs can be created. Employed workers in the formal  sector  have
much to celebrate after 10 years of freedom, but the  unemployed  have  paid
with their economic life. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr D A A OLIFANT: Mnr die Adjunkvoorsitter, ek wil darem  net  sê  dat  dit
baie duidelik is wie die mense is wat kom  kla  oor  hierdie  wette  waarmee
hulle nie tevrede is nie. Ons kan hulle opnoem: agb Groenewald, hoe lyk  dit
vir u? Agb Mark Lowe, hoe lyk dit vir u? Wie is  die  ander  een?  Hulle  is
almal so ``pale'', want hulle wil hê ons  moet  teruggaan  na  die  swaarkry
toe.

Die agb Groenewald wil weer hê die huishulpe moet terug na die  kombuiskamer
toe gaan waar hulle net kos en koffie kan verdien. U  weet  u  brein  is  so
klein dat u vergeet het dat, ná daardie wonderlike  uittog  na  Orania,  nie
lank daarna nie, het al daai huishulpe weer teruggehardloop  na  Suid-Afrika
toe, want hulle kon nie die swaarkry vat nie - en  dit  was  wit  huishulpe!
[Applous.]

So, ons moet nie vergeet waar ons vandaan kom nie. Ons moet  versigtig  wees
wat ons ook sê. Verder, Meneer, wil ek net vir jou sê  daai  wit  mannetjies
wat vir jou sê dat die mense hulle nie in  diens  kan  neem  nie  omdat  die
Minister so sê, vertel 'n blatante leuen. Dit is  onwettig  en  jy  kan  vir
hulle sê hulle kan daai persone gaan aankla by die wet. Ek kan jou  verseker
jy kan dit doen, want my Minister sê nie dit in sy wette wat hy opstel nie.

Mev S V Kalyan: Ja, baas!

Mnr D A A Olifant: O jene, hoe gaan dit met jou dan? Moet  nie  dat  ek  jou
naampie skreeu nie. Hou net jou mondjie. [Gelag.] (Translation of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr D A A OLIFANT: Mr Deputy Chairperson, I would just like to say  that  it
is very clear who the people are that come and  complain  about  these  laws
what they are dissatisfied about. We can name  them:  Hon  Groenewald,  what
does it look like to you? Hon Mark Lowe, what does it look like to you?  Who
is the other one? They are all so pale, because they want us  to  return  to
the difficult times.

The hon Groenewald in turn wants domestic workers to return to  the  kitchen
where they can only earn food and coffee. You know, your brain is  so  small
that you have forgotten, after that wonderful exodus  to  Orania,  not  long
afterwards, those domestic workers hurried back  to  South  Africa,  because
they could not handle the hardship, and they were  white  domestic  workers.
[Applause.]

So we must not forget where we come from. We must also be  careful  what  we
say. Furthermore, Sir, I just want to tell you that those little  white  men
who tell you that people cannot employ them because the  Minister  says  so,
are telling a blatant lie. It is illegal and you can  tell  them  that  they
can report those people to the authorities. I can assure you  that  you  can
do that, because my Minister does not say that in the  laws  that  he  draws
up.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Yes, master!

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Oh dear, how are you doing then? Don't let  me  shout  out
your little name. Just keep your little mouth shut. [Laughter.]]

Mr Minister, let me get back to my speech please. Let  me  leave  this  one;
when this woman starts, there will be problems.

Significant progress has been made in ensuring  that  South  Africa's  young
democracy is built on a solid foundation.  Most  of  the  institutions  that
support democracy have been put in place. [Interjections.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: I don't want to handle a woman of your calibre.  There  is
nothing there in any case.

As a result of the liberalisation  of  trade  and  exchange  control,  South
Africa's economy has opened  to  global  forces,  including  access  to  new
markets. Furthermore, South Africa's corporate sector, Government and  civil
society levels play a much ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Hon member  we  have  an
undertaking from all members that you will have interjections, but  we  have
to maintain the decorum of this House. So I  will  not  permit  this  cross-
referencing where it actually begins to become disruptive  of  the  process.
So, please, you may interject, but you may do so on the basis that  it  does
not totally  disrupt  the  proceedings.  Thank  you.  Hon  member,  you  may
proceed.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Thank you. Furthermore, South Africa's  corporate  sector,
Government and civil society levels play a much  more  significant  role  in
global debates through multilateral discussions and  agreements.  Of  course
there is no doubt  that  these  achievements  have  contributed  to  a  more
sustainable and higher growth platform in our country.

Also, our country has a number of advantages and strengths which  form  part
of the  attraction  for  domestic  and  foreign  investments.  There  is  an
abundance of natural  resources;  a  well-developed  and  efficient  capital
market; world-class companies in a number of sectors  and  very  good  laws.
And I must say your colleague, Charles Redcliffe, was there  the  other  day
when Business SA presented these, and he wholeheartedly  agreed  with  that.
Because this is what Business SA is telling us in this regard.

If the situation in our country is so bad,  and  in  particular  our  labour
laws, as Mark Lowe is saying - hon Mark ... I hope you deserve that.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  member,  there  is  no
qualification there. It is all hon members.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: If the  situation  in  our  country  is  so  bad,  as  the
opposition is saying, why are there companies such as DaimlerChrysler,  BMW,
Toyota, and Volkswagen. Why have they not packed  their  bags  and  gone  to
their countries if it was so bad? Why did  Ford,  General  Motors,  IBM  and
Mobil come back to  the  country  if  things  were  so  bad?  Instead  these
companies have opted to invest and to stay  in  this  country  so  much  so,
because the quality we produce is of such a standard  that  they  say  build
all our right-hand driven vehicles. And for that ...  [Interjections.]  They
are not going back. You're dreaming that really.

If we were such a bunch of bad, unskilled people in our workforce,  with  no
sense of quality workmanship, why did we get these vehicles to  manufacture?
And you know what, Ms Kalyan, we even won  international  awards  for  these
kinds of standards and achievements. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: She does not read the newspaper.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: She does not do that.

They did not say South Africa's labour laws are bad. It is only  this  party
that says that.

In a book named South Africa: How are you? leading economists  -  and  these
are Afrikaner people - Louis Fourie, Mike Schussler as well  as  J  P  Malan
had the following to  say,  and  I  quote:  ``Maybe  not  First  World,  but
definitely first class. Our country has improved from 39% in 1985 to 63%  to
date.''

That is the quote. And here are  people  who  are  saying  things  have  not
improved since 1994. They are definitely living in a dream world.

Tourism has grown in leaps and bounds and a significant number of jobs  have
been created in this sector. While there is job creation  in  other  sectors
of our industry, it is very true to say that our industries in  general  are
shedding jobs at an alarming rate, and  that  is  totally  unacceptable.  We
want to re-emphasise that more focus should be on  public  works  programmes
and labour-incentive ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Are you rising on  a  point  of
order hon member?

Mr C M LOWE: I am, Mr Deputy Chairperson.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, what is the point of order?

Mr C M LOWE: I would like to ask the hon member if he will take a  question.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, when  I  asked  you
whether you were rising on a point of order, you indicated yes. You  are  in
contempt of the Chair if you then proceed to some other subject. Thank  you.
Hon member, you may proceed.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: It is also a fact that ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  There  is  no  question.  You
asked for a point of order. There was no point of order. I  don't  recognise
you now. [Interjections.] Order! you may take your  seat  now.  Hon  member,
proceed.

Mr D A A OLIFANT: I'm not going to lose my time. Mr Deputy  Chairperson,  it
is also a fact that there is huge growth in the informal sector.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Point of order, Chairperson!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes. Order! Hon member, what  is  your
point of order?

Mrs S V KALYAN: My point of order is that the member is  allowed  to  ask  a
question according to the decorum which was discussed at  the  Chief  Whips'
Forum this morning. A  point  of  order  will  constitute  questions  around
procedure as well as a question to the speaker at the podium.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Ms Kalyan, I think you  are
totally incorrect in the supposition that you are making. A point  of  order
is clearly a point of order and when one rises to  ask  whether  a  question
can be taken, they are two separate, distinct things.  The  Chair  is  quite
clear in recognising the two separate ideas and I think  the  argument  that
you are making has no validity whatsoever. Thank you. Hon  member,  you  may
proceed. [Applause.]

Mr D A A OLIFANT: Hulle mors net 'n man se tyd. [They  are  just  wasting  a
man's time.]

It is also a fact that there is huge growth in the informal sector. You  can
see the flea markets and a  myriad  of  other  businesses,  such  as  garden
services, after-school care, crèches, dance classes, open-air  hair  salons,
cellphone and car exhaust repairs as well as IT  companies,  of  which  some
focus on website design in particular.

Do you think that these informal companies have  robots  doing  their  work?
Absolutely not; it is human beings. There is a level of  employment.  It  is
also extremely difficult to give an accurate account of where  those  people
are who lose their jobs in the formal sector who then go into  the  informal
sector. It is also a known fact that South Africans are beginning to  create
jobs for themselves, because they are becoming business people.  [Applause.]


And I also need to reflect, Mr Deputy Chairperson and Mr Minister, that  the
whole question of job shedding did not start in 1994. I  mean  we  must  not
confuse ourselves. The whole question of job shedding started  way  back  in
the seventies and as a result of the skewed economy  of  this  country,  and
where we were the losers at all times since  that  period,  jobs  have  been
lost. We mustn't come here and confuse ourselves that we are just to  blame.
We are busy at this point and we are doing a remarkable  job,  and  that  is
really to bring the economy and the structures of this economy  into  place,
so that we can benefit at the end of  the  day.  We  are  not  making  cheap
politics about this, like the DP.

I must also tell you that in the mid-eighties, PW Botha started a  quick-fix
skills development programme, which turned out to be a big disaster.  Now  I
want to tell you, hon Minister,  the  fact  that  you  have  now  introduced
programmes such as the Setas and the Skills Development Programme makes  our
future more certain in this particular country. We will be able  to  attract
much more foreign investment now and thus create more job opportunities.

We also want to acknowledge that some Setas are very successful  with  their
programmes and their implementation, while others leave much to  be  desired
and we are appealing to the department to please do something  about  it.  I
just need to stress that the function of the Labour Ministry - Mr  Lowe  you
must please listen - and the department is to  ensure  that  good  laws  and
procedures are being put in place to protect workers. It is only you  people
who complain about that. Our people who were  at  the  receiving  end  never
complained about these laws. Are you people  complaining?  No,  we  are  not
complaining. You people are complaining, because you want to go back to  the
days of exploitation. That's what you want to do. Those days are  gone.  You
must remember that.

Mr Minister, you have already said in your speech  today  that  the  initial
target ... [Interjections.] I wonder  whether  you  lived  in  Bishopscourt.
Didn't you live in Marabastad? I wonder. [Laughter.]

You have already said in your speech today that the initial target of 3  000
persons for the learnership programme for 2000-01  have  far  exceeded  your
expectations with a whopping 23 517 persons to date that are already in  the
learnership programme, of which over 8 000 were unemployed. If  we  add,  of
course, the 17 000 that  are  currently  in  the  programmes,  then  we  are
talking about over 41 000 people.

We want to congratulate you, Minister, because we  believe  in  achievement.
As the community of Atlantis we want to add to  this  ever-growing  success.
This coming Friday, 30 May  2003,  a  company  called  Atlantis  Forge  will
launch its first learnership programme through Merseta and we  promise  that
you can be assured of a very huge success. The reason for this is that  this
company has dislodged itself from the now defunct  Atlantis  Diesel  Engines
and pursued a direction of full adherence to and engagement  in  the  growth
employment equity  programme  by  doing  the  following:  Where  this  heavy
engineering and automotive component manufacturing company  was  once  white
and coloured male dominated, it now has a high percentage  of  African  men,
African and coloured women as well as disabled men and women working on  the
shop floor. This is apart from the normal white women working  there.  These
people are working on an equal footing  with  their  able-bodied  colleagues
with industrial giants such as DaimlerChrysler - I'm coming back to  that  -
Perkins, Ford,  Caterpillar,  Bell  and  Iveco.  And  these  components  are
exclusively for export. This company has also introduced  an  apprenticeship
programme as well as  provided  bursaries  for  the  workers'  children  and
student engineers, of whom some are African, who are doing their  internship
at this company.

Having said all this, we also know the sad history of  Atlantis  as  a  true
child of apartheid prostitution, unemployment and social problems. We  hope,
given this background, that Atlantis Forge will be a shining  example  of  a
company that is taking responsibility for its workforce and  its  community.
We hope that other companies in  Atlantis  and  other  industries  in  other
areas will follow suit.

Lastly, Deputy Chairperson, in supporting this budget and pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty, we in the ANC  and  the  majority  of  South  Africans
know, Minister, that  you  have  chosen  the  right  path.  With  all  these
training programmes, the rights  and  protection  of  domestic  workers  and
farmworkers as well as workers in other sectors, we can only say,  don't  be
misled by these whingers and whiners like the DA, which they are,  but  look
around and see all the achievements that we have achieved in  such  a  short
period of time. I thank you. [Applause.]

UMPHATHISWA WEZABASEBENZI:  Mhlalingaphambili,  mandiqale  ngokubulela  onke
amalungu athe athabatha inxaxheba apha. Ndisifundile  isiqanaqwana  sentetho
yakho, mfo kaNefolovhodwe, kanti kuwe  Mama  uRajbally  ndibamba  ngazibini.
Amalungu  eNkongolo  sesiwaxelele  ukuba  asijiki,  siya   phambili   nokuba
sekumnyam' entla. Ndibamba ngazibini.

Andingekhe ke kodwa ndihlale phantsi  ndingakhange  ndiwulungise  lo  mcimbi
weli lungu,  ohloniphekileyo  uGroenewald  kunye  neli  qela  likweli  cala.
Kungelishwa ukuba libe ngasekhohlo apha kum.

Andazi  ukuba  i-DA  ibathabathi  phi  oothwantu   bamaqiqisholo   eziqihela
zezinyhola. [Kwahlekwa.] [uwele-wele.]
Ithetha loo nto kanye. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Chairperson, let me start off by thanking  all  hon
members who  took  part  in  this  debate.  I've  read  a  portion  of  your
contribution, hon Nefolovhodwe, and to you, Mama Rajbally, I say thank  you.
We have already told members of the ANC that there is no  turning  back,  we
are moving ahead, rain or shine. Thank you.

Indeed, I cannot leave the podium without correcting hon Groenewald and  the
party on my left. It is unfortunate that it is on  my  left.  I  don't  know
where the DA gets its hopeless nincompoops. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]  It
means exactly that.]

Is it not embarrassing that the only contributions the DA can offer  to  the
Growth and Development Summit are criticism and the rehash  of  the  sterile
debate that if we allowed workers to be killed at  work  and  paid  a  slave
wage, more investment would be raised and more jobs would be created?
I'm not sure whether it is owing  to  a  problem  of  collective,  selective
amnesia, or the turnover of DA labour spokespersons that  this  illegitimate
debate is being rehashed, because less than two years ago the  DA  supported
a set of amendments to labour legislation, aimed at sharpening  the  balance
between labour market efficiency and decent labour standards. Our  approach,
as empirical evidence shows, has led to an improvement  in  workplace  peace
and stability and to a drastic reduction  in  person  days  lost  to  strike
action.

If you don't want peace and stability, what more do you  want,  DA?  Do  you
want anarchy and chaos? Despite the  DA's  self-righteous  pontification  on
this matter, we shall proceed with the Growth  and  Development  Summit  and
ensure that it succeeds, because the success of the summit shall  constitute
an important milestone in steering our country to a prosperous and  glorious
future, under the leadership of the ANC Government.

Such success will bring shame  to  those  who  unapologetically  believe  in
market supremacy.  However,  since  the  majority  of  freedom-loving  South
Africans - black and white, hon Groenewald - share  the  dream  of  a  South
Africa that is characterised by high levels of growth and investment,  since
they share the dream of a country where there is equitable  distribution  of
wealth, since they also share the dream of a country with  an  abundance  of
access to jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities, it is  the  responsibility
of all of us to ensure that the collective dream of the  majority  of  South
Africans does not turn into a nightmare.

As creative participants in  the  reconstruction  of  a  new  order  in  our
country, we must hold fast to our dreams. For if  dreams  die,  our  country
will be like a broken-winged bird that cannot fly and a barren fleet  frozen
with snow. As our President once said, we as South Africans  "must  together
run our own Comrades marathon as comrades who are ready  to  take  the  road
together, refusing to be discouraged by the recognition  that  the  road  is
very long, the inclines very steep and that, at times, what we  see  at  the
end is but a mirage".

The President said  further:  "When  the  race  is  run,  all  humanity  and
ourselves will acknowledge the  fact  that  we  only  succeeded  because  we
believed in our own dreams." Even  if  those  dreams  seemed  impossible  in
1955, we dreamed anyway. Even if they seemed improbable for more than  three
decades thereafter, we continued to dream. Even if these dreams  seemed  too
ambitious in 1994, we pursued a strategy aimed at realising those dreams.

For its part, my department will confidently and  enthusiastically  continue
to steer our country in the direction dreamed of by the  majority  of  South
Africans, recognising that this  race  is  a  marathon  not  a  sprint.  The
distance is long and the surface on which we run is rough, but hardly a  day
goes by without us reducing the distance still to be covered. [Applause.]

For this reason I do want to thank those who made these  advances  possible.
I want to thank our director-general, Adv  Ramashia,  and  his  hard-working
team which is sitting there with him, and our new -  very  new  -  executive
managing director in the Free State. Stand  up,  mama.  Let  Groenewald  see
you. [Applause.]

I say that he must see you, because the  ANC  has  never  had  its  struggle
against white people. [Applause.] Ever since  its  inception  in  1912,  our
struggle was  against  racism.  [Applause.]  The  reason  why  we  are  firm
Africans is precisely because of  the  problem  that  was  created  by  your
fathers. If there was  no  apartheid,  then  there  would  be  no  need  for
affirmative action.

Mr Groenewald, you are suffering  from  conveniently  selective  amnesia  as
well. [Laughter.] It is because we want to  undo  what  your  ancestors  did
through the job reservations Act - remember that, Mnr Groenewald -  that  we
are embarking on an affirmative action programme precisely because  of  what
your fathers did. [Interjections.] He cites  sporadic  cases  of  two  white
students allegedly discriminated against. Has he forgotten that it  was  his
ancestors who promulgated the Bantu Education Act that was aimed  at  making
blacks the hewers of wood and drawers of water? How  can  you  forget  that?
[Interjections.]

Is he aware that the majority of those  who  are  poor  and  unemployed  are
black youth? Is he aware that this  phenomenon  was  not  occasioned  by  an
accident of history, but engineered by a racist regime? He belonged to  that
racist regime. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Let me proudly tell you,  my  brother,  that  the  ANC  wants  a  nonracial,
democratic and nonsexist South Africa. If you read the Constitution  of  the
ANC - 2.1 of that Constitution - you will see that our main objective is  to
unite the people of this country, blacks and Africans in particular.

Mr P J GROENEWALD: United in affirmative action.

The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Affirmative action, my  brother,  we  will  continue
with. We will affirm the blacks that you with your ancestors have  tried  to
undermine.

Ons is nie domkoppe nie. Ons is slim. [Applous.] [We are not stupid. We  are
clever. [Applause.]]

This is our land. Umhlaba, ngowethu!  Ilizwe,  lelethu!  Kufuneka  sonke  ke
singcamle  ubuncwane  beli  lizwe,  nokuba  uyathanda,   nokuba   akuthandi,
Groenewald. Abantwana bakho baza kungcamla  ilizwe  elikhululekileyo  ngenxa
yombutho  lo  wesizwe  i-ANC.  Wena  abantwana   bakho   ubasa   esihogweni.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[The land is ours! The country is ours! We must all enjoy  the  niceties  of
this country, whether you like it or  not,  Groenewald.  Your  children  are
going to enjoy life in a free country because of the national  organisation,
the ANC. You are leading your children towards hell. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Yes, hon member.

Mr C AUCAMP:  Hon  Chairperson,  I  want  to  raise  a  point  of  order  in
connection ... [Interjections.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order! Yes, hon member.

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, is it in order for a Minister  -  if  he  has  the
opportunity in his reply - to  answer  questions  members  raised  in  their
speeches? While I was speaking the Minister was  answering  me  from  across
the floor, shouting ``yes'' and shouting ``no'', but  he  didn't  answer  me
when  he  had  the  opportunity  in  his   speech.   Is   that   in   order?
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member,  I  think  you  know  very
well that whoever comes to the speaker's podium  is  quite  free  to  choose
what he or she wants to say and to neglect what he or she does not  want  to
say. That is the choice of the person who is at the podium.  The  Chair  has
no ability in any way to ensure that something happens that will be  to  the
satisfaction of all members.

THE MINISTER OF LABOUR: Bendicinga ukuba uza  kundibona,  Mhlalingaphambili.
[I thought you were going to see me, Chairperson.]
I was just going to tell him, the hon Aucamp, and  Groenewald  ...  ngumgubo
wengxow' enye. [They are birds of a feather.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Minister, you've  had  your
say. Also, thank you. I think it has been a long evening,  but  Wfortunately
we've now come to the end.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 19:43.
