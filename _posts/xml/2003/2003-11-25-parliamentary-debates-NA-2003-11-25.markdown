                     INTERNATIONAL DISABILITY RIGHTS DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that 3 December is International Disability Rights Day;


  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  for many years disability was treated merely  as  a  health  and
           welfare issue;


       (b)  disability was not included in the human rights and  development
           agenda of societies; and


       (c)  in this  regard,  disabled  people  were  treated  as  dependent
           objects of pity;


  (3) believes that the formation of the disablity rights movement in South
       Africa began the process of change towards  a  positive  approach  to
       disability;


  (4) further believes that since 1994 the new democratic  Government  has,
       through legislation and other policies, begun the process of creating
       a climate within which disability rights are  respected  and  upheld,
       and on 1 January 1999 the Africa  Decade  for  Disabled  Persons  was
       declared; and


  (5) calls on -


       (a)  all South Africans to actively transform their attitude  towards
           people with disabilities so that disabled people can take  their
           rightful place in classrooms, jobs and society in general; and


       (b)   all  Government   departments   to   continue   the   work   of
           transformation to enable people living with disabilities to have
           access to buildings, transport, justice, education,  health  and
           welfare.

Agreed to.

   SUSPENSION OF RULE 253(1) IN ORDER TO CONDUCT SECOND READING DEBATE ON
                        PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That Rule 253(1) be suspended for the purposes of conducting  the  Second
  Reading debate on the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Bill  [B  19  -  2002]
  (National Assembly - sec 75).

Agreed to.

 RATIFICATION OF DECISION OF JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE TO FAST-TRACK PROCEEDINGS ON
                    ELECTORAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper as follows:


  That the House ratifies the decision the Joint Subcommittee of the  Joint
  Programme Committee adopted on 20 November 2003 in accordance with  Joint
  Rule 216(2), namely that the proceedings on  the  Electoral  Laws  Second
  Amendment Bill [B 73 - 2003] (National Assembly - sec 75) be fast-tracked
  by, where necessary, shortening any period within which any step  in  the
  legislative process relating to the Bill must be completed, in  order  to
  make it possible for the Bill to be passed  by  the  adjournment  of  the
  current parliamentary session (see Announcements, Tablings and  Committee
  Reports, 20 November 2003, p 1503).

Agreed to.

     SIXTEEN DAYS OF ACTIVISM FOR NO VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms A VAN WYK (ANC): Today we South Africans join millions around  the  world
in marking the start of Sixteen Days of Activism  for  No  Violence  Against
Women and Children. The  16  days  of  activism  will  run  from  today,  25
November, to 10 December. During this  period,  Government,  community-based
organisations, NGOs and other sectors of civil society will  be  campaigning
for greater awareness about violence directed at women  and  children.  This
year's campaign focuses on strategic partnerships  between  Government,  the
private  sector,  civil  society,  organised  labour  and   the   diplomatic
community to spread the message to combat this inhumane crime.

All South Africans are asked to show their  support  for  this  campaign  by
wearing white ribbons for the duration of the 16 days campaign. Let  us  all
contribute to the national effort  to  eradicate  the  scourge  of  violence
against women and children. Let us  build  a  humane  society  that  values,
loves and nurtures itself. [Applause.]

                            RACIST FREEDOM FRONT

                            (Member's Statement)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE LARGEST MINORITY  PARTY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the
hand-licking lapdog FF we see in Parliament is quite  different  outside.  A
by-election occurs tomorrow in  Randfontein,  the  constituency  of  Mr  Boy
Geldenhuys,  but  which  is  known  as  ``Mulderwêreld''.  The  New  NP  has
surrendered and is supporting the ANC. The FF is fighting a  vicious  racist
campaign.

In contrast to the ANC, which accuses us of being  far  too  white,  the  FF
pamphlet states that there is a simple difference between  the  DA  and  the
FF. They say, correctly, that DA membership is now more than 60%  black  and
the DA youth is about 90% black. They say that,  in  contrast,  their  party
stands for Afrikaners and ``ons eie wyse''. They  also  say  the  following:
What has the black ANC done for you and what can the black DA  do  for  you?
Here are the pamphlets, I'm going to pass them around.

South Africa needs to know the racist face of the FF since being taken  over
by the Conservative Party and the AWB. They're  your  favourite  opposition,
you must rethink it.
The FF needs to know that  the  overwhelming  majority  of  South  Africans,
including Afrikaans speakers who, in droves, vote for the  DA,  have  chosen
South Africa above Orania and have chosen to live together in peace  and  to
reject  racism.  And,  tomorrow  Randfontein  will  reject  the  racist  FF.
[Applause.]

                     VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr U ROOPNARAIN (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, today is the beginning  of  the
Sixteen Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women  and  Children.  This
is meant to highlight the plight of women and children who are subjected  to
all forms of abuse on a daily basis in our country.

We appreciate the efforts of our  Government  in  trying  to  highlight  the
seriousness of this matter. The reality is that we are still inundated  with
cases of violence and abuse against women and  children,  which  is  clearly
unacceptable. Freedom will only be attained once  all  forms  of  abuse  are
totally eliminated in our society.

We therefore urge that these 16 days of activism  must  not  be  a  symbolic
gesture, and, therefore, we call on all men and women to unite against  this
violence and say ``no'' to violence against women and children. Thank you.

                     NATIONAL FEMALE FARMER OF THE YEAR

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs T J TSHIVASE (ANC): Deputy Speaker, we say Halala! Tendani Sinwamadi  on
being crowned National Female Farmer of the Year. In a ceremony held at  the
Grand Hotel, Mrs Tendani Sinwamadi from Venda in Limpopo, this weekend,  won
the National Female Farmer of the Year Award.  The  competition,  which  was
established in 1999 by the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land  Affairs,
recognised the role played by  rural  women  in  contributing  towards  food
security and economic growth.

Mrs Sinwamaḓi obtained the award through her skills in farming  with  export
bananas. The ANC congratulates her  and  takes  pride  in  the  progress  we
continue to make in the struggle to empower women so  that  they  can  claim
their rightful place in the economic life of the country.

Ri khou ṱuṱuwedza vhafumakadzi vha mahayani uri vha dzhenele  kha  u  takusa
ikonomi ya shango sa zwe vho Tendani Sinwamaḓi vha  ita.  Sa  ANC,  ri  khou
fhululedza mishumo nga maanḓa nahone sa Muvhuso, ri a i hulisa. Kha vha  ise
phanḓa u fhirisa afha. Ndi a livhuwa. [U  Vhanda  Zwanḓa.]  (Translation  of
Tshivenḓa paragraph follows.)

[We encourage rural women to take part  in  uplifting  the  economy  of  the
country, just as Mrs Tendani Sinwamadi did. As the ANC,  we  highly  applaud
the good work done by her and as the Government, we cherish it. Keep up  the
good work. I thank you. [Applause.]]

                  NEW NP'S CONTRIBUTION TO NEW SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr B L GELDENHUYS (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die  Adjunkspeaker,  as  'n  gebaar  van
erkenning  het  president   Mbeki   tydens   die   prysuitdeling   van   die
Presidentsgholftoernooi oud-president F W de Klerk geprys vir sy  bydrae  in
die oorgang tot en die geboorte van 'n nuwe Suid-Afrika. Hy het  hom  geprys
as 'n voorloper om apartheid af te skaf.

Hierdie erkenning  onderstreep  opnuut  die  dikwels  vergete  rol  wat  die
destydse NP gespeel het in die totstandkoming van 'n  nuwe  Suid-Afrika.  In
plaas daarvan om die land in vlamme te laat opgaan  het  die  destydse  ANC-
leiers en NP-leiers besluit om in vrede te onderhandel oor die  toekoms,  en
dit was die regte ding om te doen in belang van Suid-Afrika en al sy  mense.


Net so is die jongste besluit  van  die  ANC  en  die  huidige  Nuwe  NP  om
konstruktief saam te werk, in plaas van om net op  mekaar  te  skree  vanuit
hulle politieke loopgrawe, weer eens die regte ding om te doen en dit is  in
die  beste  belang  van  Suid-Afrika  en  al  sy  mense.   [Tussenwerpsels.]
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Dr B L GELDENHUYS (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, during  the  prize-giving
ceremony of the President's golf tournament, President Mbeki, as  a  gesture
of recognition, praised former President F W de Klerk for  his  contribution
to the transition to and the birth of a new South Africa. He praised him  as
a frontrunner in the process of abolishing apartheid.

This recognition again underlines the often overlooked role  played  by  the
erstwhile NP in the establishment  of  the  new  South  Africa.  Instead  of
allowing the country to go up  in  flames,  the  then  ANC  and  NP  leaders
decided to negotiate in peace about the  future,  and  this  was  the  right
thing to do in the interests of South Africa and all its people.

Similarly, the latest decision of the ANC and the current  New  NP  to  work
together in a constructive manner instead of merely shouting at one  another
from within their political trenches, is, once again, the right thing to  do
and  it  is  in  the  interests  of  South  Africa  and  all   its   people.
[Interjections.][Applause.]]

                             UNSPENT DONOR FUNDS

                            (Member's Statement)

Rev K R J MESHOE (ACDP): Deputy Speaker, the ACDP welcomes the  announcement
that the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr Brian Cowen,  has  pledged  millions  of
rands to the South African Government  after  touring  poor  communities  in
Johannesburg and Pretoria. About R264 million will be  made  available  over
three years to assist the Government's development projects.

However, we were shocked to  hear  earlier  this  month  that  donations  of
nearly R1 billion are sitting idle in the  Government's  Reconstruction  and
Development Fund and that about R40 million of this money has been  returned
to donors in Europe because of a lack of capacity to spend sait.
There are many poor and homeless  South  Africans  desperately  waiting  for
help from Government. By not spending  aid  money  to  help  the  poor,  the
Government is sending  the  message  that  it  does  not  care  about  them,
particularly when they allow millions of rands to be sent back to donors.

Not being able to distribute the funds due to a lack of capacity after  nine
years of governing is inexcusable. Capacity-building must be a  priority  so
that all our needy individuals and communities will  benefit  from  generous
donors who are  pledging  millions  of  rands  to  our  Government.  If  the
Government has capacity problems, as it surely does, then the unspent  money
should be directed to the non-governmental organisations, such  as  churches
and others at grass-roots level, to use it to help the poor. Thank you.

Siswati member’s statement follows.)

[Mrs D G NHLENGETHWA (ANC): Deputy Speaker, today the  Deputy  President  is
officially launching the sixteen Days of Activism for  No  Violence  Against
Women and Children campaign at Kimberley. However, there are  still  farmers
that are stiff-necked and who still continue to abuse women and children.

In the Mpumalanga province there is a farm called ``Waaihoek'' in  the  Gert
Sibande Region of the Msukaligwa municipality, Sheepmore. The farm owner  is
Mr M Meyer. He assaulted and evicted Mrs Alvina  Sikhosana  and  her  family
without the authority of a court order.
Thereafter, the matter was reported to the police and a docket  of  assault,
abuse  and  destruction  of  property  was  opened.  The  case   number   is
36/10/2003. The constituency office  followed  up  that  case  to  establish
whether the suspect had been arrested or not. The reply  from  the  district
commissioner was that the matter was being investigated and that they  still
had to obtain another statement from  a  certain  witness.  The  office  was
assured that the docket would then be forwarded to the Public Prosecutor.

The farm owner denied having beaten Mrs Alvina Sikhosana, but  claimed  that
he had merely scared her by chasing her. In actual fact,  he  destroyed  her
chicken coop, and eggs worth R300 were crushed together with  the  shed.  He
also destroyed her furniture and, to crown it all, he forced the  family  to
sign a letter saying that they  were  to  vacate  the  farm  with  immediate
effect.

The family had already submitted their ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

                 AWARDS FOR NELSON MANDELA AND FRENE GINWALA

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr G W KOORNHOF (ANC): During  their  recent  visit  to  South  Africa,  the
Brazilian delegation, led by President Lula da Silva,  handed  to  President
Thabo Mbeki a certificate conferring on former President Nelson Mandela  the
freedom of the Brazilian town of Sao Bernardo do Campo and yesterday, on  24
November, Comrade Frene Ginwala, the Speaker of this House, was awarded  the
North-South Prize, an annual award that recognises  outstanding  achievement
in the protection of human rights.

These recent awards to South Africans are a  further  demonstration  of  the
honoured role that we as a country  and  people  continue  to  play  in  the
advancement of the struggle for a just and humane world. That  these  awards
have been conferred on members of the African National Congress, is a  clear
demonstration of the trust and confidence that the world and the  people  of
our country have in the ANC. This is further proof and acknowledgement  that
the ANC remains at the forefront of the  struggle  for  the  creation  of  a
better life for all.

We salute and congratulate u'Tata  u'Madiba.  We  share  the  pleasure  with
Comrade Ginwala. Together we will continue  to  work  for  our  common  good
until we defeat poverty, the legacy of  racism  and  sexism.  I  thank  you.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

              RESTRICTION OF ACCESS OF VEHICLES TO COASTAL ZONE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr V C GORE (DA):  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism has restricted the access of  vehicles  to  the  coastal
zone. These  regulations  are  aimed  at  protecting  the  environment  from
uncaring and irresponsible drivers on South African beaches.

However, the Minister has also prevented access to our wonderful beaches  by
disabled people. Of all the disabled persons who have applied for  exemption
from the ban, not one has received the go-ahead from Minister Moosa to  gain
access to beaches. It is simply ludicrous to believe that  a  small  handful
of disabled people, spread along the entire South African  coastline,  could
cause such disastrous damage that the hon  Minister  sees  fit  to  restrict
their constitutionally enshrined right to freedom of movement.

The DA implores the Minister to come  to  his  senses.  He  must  stop  what
clearly amounts to unfair discrimination against  a  significant  sector  of
our society who cannot simply  walk  onto  the  beaches.  Think  again,  hon
Minister, and allow disabled people to enjoy the splendours and  wonders  of
South African beaches. I thank you. [Applause.]

                  BEACH FATALITIES OVER THE FESTIVE SEASON

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr T E VEZI (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, with the sunny summer  weather  and
the festive season fast approaching, there is bound to  be  an  increase  in
the number of people on our beaches. This  is  supposed  to  be  a  time  of
celebration and fun, but this could just as easily  be  a  tragic  time  for
many people.  During  this  period  there  are,  usually,  cases  of  people
drowning or children getting lost.

This past weekend, there were already a number of reported cases  of  people
almost drowning at beaches here in the Western  Cape.  There  was  also  the
case of a 15-year-old boy who disappeared while swimming in the  ocean,  and
who has not been found yet. He is feared to have drowned.

We therefore urge all beach-goers, especially over the  festive  season,  to
exercise extreme caution and only swim  where  there  are  lifeguards.  They
should also obey and heed the warnings of the  lifeguards  and  observe  the
rules of the various beaches, as they are there for our own protection.

We should do everything in our power to enjoy the festive season  and  avoid
the unnecessary loss of lives. I thank you. [Applause.]

                LANDSLIDE VICTORIES BY SASCO AT UNIVERSITIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr K M MOEKETSE (ANC): Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  recently,  students  at  the
University of the Western Cape and the University  of  Zululand  held  their
annual  student  representative  council  elections  at   their   respective
campuses. Students turned up in  their  numbers  to  vote  for  the  student
political organisations of their  choice.  In  these  elections  which  were
keenly contested by different student  political  organisations,  the  South
African Students' Congress, Sasco, won all the seats on both campuses,  that
is the Universities of the Western Cape and Zululand.

Bearing in mind  that  the  student  population  constitutes  a  significant
percentage of young people who will be voting  for  the  first  time  during
next year's elections, these  landslide  victories  by  Sasco  are  a  clear
signal of our young people's confidence in  the  ANC,  and  demonstrate  the
continued relevance of our policies and programmes.
We congratulate Sasco on its  decisive  victories.  We  take  pride  in  the
slogan they used for their campaign, which said and I quote:  ``A  vote  for
Sasco is a vote for ANC!''

We also take pride in the fact that democratic processes are becoming a  way
of life in South Africa, with all sections of  our  population  learning  to
rely on democratic practices  and  principles  to  regulate  their  affairs.
Thank you. [Applause.]

                    WOMEN AND CHILD ABUSE IN SOUTH AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New  NP):  Madam  Speaker,  during  the  16  days  of  activism
everyone is encouraged to take a stand against violence  and  against  abuse
of women and children. The New NP supports this campaign.  But,  what  about
the other 349 days? South Africa is moving toward its tenth  anniversary  of
democracy. And, still women and children are being victimised! What  is  the
use of a gender-sensitive Constitution  if  women  and  children  are  being
raped and murdered?

South Africa's rape statistics are amongst the highest in  the  world.  And,
with HIV/Aids, rape has become the equivalent of a death sentence. Abuse  of
women and children in South Africa has  reached  shocking  proportions,  and
these figures are escalating. Government has expressed  its  concern  during
Child Protection Week, Women's Day and will, again,  do  so  during  the  16
days of activism. But, this is not enough.

Even though the Deputy President made it clear that there will be no  change
in the Government's policy with regard to the death penalty, there is  still
a public outcry for justice. In the absence  of  the  death  penalty,  other
means of discouraging criminal behaviour must be found.

The New NP would like to urge all men  to  take  a  stand  against  violence
directed at women and children and support the men's  march  in  Cape  Town,
today. Let this period of activism not only last for 16 days. I thank you.

             CORRUPTION AND MALPRACTICES AMONGST PUBLIC SERVANTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr A BLAAS (ACDP): Agb Adjunkspeaker,  alle  regeringsfere  is  blootgestel
aan korrupsie en wanpraktyke van amptenare.  Daar  is  gevalle  bekend  waar
boukontrakteurs in Gauteng betaal is vir huise wat  hulle  gebou  het,  maar
nie een baksteen gelê het nie, en nou bou hulle huise in die Vrystaat.

Daar is amptenare wat weens korrupsie aangekla en ontslaan  is  in  Gauteng,
wat nou in senior posisies aangestel is in KwaZulu-Natal. Gauteng beoog  nou
om 'n stelsel te implementeer waarvolgens hierdie mense op  'n  lys  geplaas
gaan word en dié inligting sal versprei  word  na  ander  provinsies  om  te
voorkom dat die amptenare of kontrakteurs weer 'n geleentheid kry.

Enige maatreël om korrupsie of die herhaling  daarvan  te  voorkom  kan  net
voordeel inhou. Die gedagte behoort uitgebrei te word na alle provinsies  en
ook na nasionale vlak sodat 'n sinvolle databasis bygehou kan word en  mense
daarvan verhoed kan word om die regering  twee  keer  te  benadeel.  Dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS (ACDP): Hon Deputy Speaker, all the spheres  of  government  are
exposed to corruption and malpractices of officials. There are  known  cases
of building contractors in Gauteng who were paid for houses  that  they  had
built, whereas they had not laid a single brick for these houses  and  these
same contractors are now building houses in the Free State.

There are officials, who were  charged  with  corruption  and  dismissed  in
Gauteng, who have now been appointed in senior positions  in  KwaZulu-Natal.
Gauteng now intends to implement a system whereby these people will  be  put
on a list and this information will be disseminated to  other  provinces  to
prevent these officials or contractors from getting another opportunity.

Any measure to prevent corruption or its  recurrence  can  only  be  to  our
advantage. This idea should be extended to all provinces  and  the  national
level so that a meaningful database can  be  maintained  to  prevent  people
from doing Government an injustice twice. Thank you.]

 ACKNOWLEDGING AND PRESERVING OUR HISTORY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING SOUTH
                                   AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L M KGWELE (ANC): The Atlantic Sea Board is rich in  history.  Throughout
South African history, the Atlantic Sea Board was  a  refuge  to  those  who
were on the fringes of mainstream society. Slaves and nonconformists,  those
suffering from diseases brought here  by  the  colonialists,  and  Jews  and
Muslims who came to South Africa, then all  settled  there  in  what  was  a
thoroughly integrated society. In many ways it was a  small  cosmos  of  our
country's history. The discovery of skeletons in  July  served  as  a  stark
reminder of our history and of the history of the Atlantic Sea Board.

The symbolic appearance of these skeletons in a free  South  Africa  reminds
us that, in building our future, we need to  acknowledge  and  preserve  our
history for the generations of tomorrow. The voices  of  the  past  are  now
asking us whether we are going to allow the  development  of  De  Waterkant,
near Greenpoint and the Waterfront, to continue  without  acknowledging  the
rich  history  that  lies  within  the  streets  and  is  hidden  underneath
buildings. We need to remember and adequately  commemorate  this  very  real
part of our history. In their long-term planning  and  development  strategy
for the area, the city council and private  developers  need  to  take  this
rich history into consideration and it  should  form  an  integral  part  of
future development in the area.

The communities need to be involved and they must be  consulted  in  finding
an inclusive and respectable  way  in  which  this  part  of  our  unwritten
history can be told and preserved for the future. I  call  on  the  relevant
government departments to ensure that they  consult  widely.  I  would  also
like to commend the Hands-off Prestwich group for the commendable work  they
are doing in ensuring a more inclusive and  consultative  process.  The  ANC
branch in Sea Point offers its full support. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Are there any Ministers who would  like  to  respond  to
the statements? The Ministers are not in the mood today. Clearly  there  was
nothing the Ministers want to respond to. After  scratching  his  head,  the
hon Alec Erwin.

                          PRESIDENT'S CUP AT GEORGE

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I  seek
protection for the nature and structure of my  head  from  these  very  rude
colleagues, please.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: You are protected. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: I would just like to say  that  I  think
that the events at George over the weekend were  really  very  exciting  for
our country. Not only because we showcased exactly what we can do, but  also
how people participated, our excellent crowds and mixed  representatives  of
our people.

My scores at golf were far better than Minister Manuel's, but that  is  what
you would expect. But I think the final event, where President Mbeki  showed
what we have achieved in South Africa by taking  former  President  F  W  de
Klerk's hand, did indicate what we have done as a nation. And I was  struck,
as I think all of us there were, by the comments  of  visiting  people.  The
Americans were saying to me: We feel so  relaxed  and  comfortable  in  this
country. I think this is a great achievement. Thank you. [Applause.]

                                  EU GRANTS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. I would like to  respond
to the statement made by the hon leader of the  ACDP.  The  money  that  was
returned to the  EU  was  returned  in  very  specific  cirmcumstances.  The
negotiations between the EU and provinces and sometimes between  cities  and
towns were done individually rather than at the national level. The EU,  for
its part, had tightened up the conditions of these grants over a  period  of
time,  and  some  of  these  were  negotiated  as  early  as  1994  and  the
circumstances for which the grants were requested had changed.  In  each  of
those instances it wasn't possible to renegotiate the use of the grant.

Right now the EU has tightened up even further on the conditions of  grants.
I think we will see across the world that the EU  will  recall  grants  from
countries. They call it not decommissioning, but  decommitting  moneys.  And
so in circumstances where allocations  have  been  made  over  a  number  of
years, they are suddenly terminating programmes. We have unfortunately  also
seen this in respect of the  UK,  where  they  now  need  to  fund  enormous
commitments in respect of the war in Iraq and so  on  and  are  decommitting
resources that had been properly negotiated with South Africa.

These are the circumstances  and  I  think  it's  quite  important  that  we
understand that in each of the instances  there  would  be  a  very  tightly
structured contract, the terms of which are tightened even  as  you  proceed
so it is not possible to  comply  with  circumstances  that  would  see  the
transfer of those grant moneys to NGOs. The RDP fund is merely a  mechanism.
It is a mechanism into which moneys are received and then reallocated.  It's
just a street through which money passes.  It  doesn't  have  any  say  over
their allocations or over their contracts. The RDP fund was  established  in
1996 merely to act as a conduit and we  report  to  Parliament  annually  on
what has  travelled  through  it.  Thank  you  very  much,  Deputy  Speaker.
[Applause.]

                    ELECTORAL LAWS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF HOME  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  subsequent  to  the
passing of the Electoral Laws Amendment Act, Act 34 of 2003; by  Parliament,
representations were  made  to  the  President  and  the  Deputy  President.
Reportedly, a key promoter of such representations was  our  colleague,  the
hon MP, Dr C Mulder, who reportedly made them on  behalf  of  South  African
citizens living abroad, arguing that the Electoral Laws  Amendment  Act,  as
it stood, infringed upon their constitutional right to vote.

When I spoke to this House during the debate on my  department's  budget,  I
had committed myself to making provision to enable South Africans abroad  to
vote. Accordingly, in the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill which I  brought  to
Cabinet,  provision  was  made  for  all  South  Africans  abroad  to  vote,
irrespective of their reasons for being abroad. However, Cabinet  chose  not
to adopt my proposal and I am bound as a  member  of  Cabinet  to  abide  by
that.

During its parliamentary process, the  Electoral  Laws  Amendment  Bill  was
amended by the portfolio committee to make provisions similar to  those  now
contained in the Electoral Laws Second Amendment Bill, which is  now  before
us. However, such provisions were then dropped.

After considering representations submitted  to  him,  His  Excellency,  the
President, instructed that urgent amendments be prepared to provide for  the
casting of votes by South Africans who are registered on  the  voters'  roll
and are temporarily absent from the Republic during the election,  elsewhere
than the voting district where they reside.

I am pleased, Madam Deputy Speaker, that what I had originally proposed,  as
the responsible line function Minister, has now been partially accepted  and
is before us for approval.

I would like to state for the record that I have made many  other  proposals
within my line function's responsibilites and as the leader  of  a  minority
party in Cabinet. These proposals - which have not  been  embraced  even  in
this House - ranged from  civic  affairs  matters  to  HIV/Aids,  crime  and
unemployment. Because he seems to carry more credence than I  do,  I  should
perhaps have considered asking the hon Dr Mulder to champion them.

I do not believe that the Electoral Laws Amendment Act,  as  it  stands,  is
unconstitutional, because the right  of  citizens  abroad  to  vote  may  be
limited, as it is limited in many established democracies. However,  I  felt
that as a matter of policy it was essential to allow all South  Africans  an
opportunity to participate  in  its  electoral  process,  when  I  made  the
original suggestion.

However, what in my opinion was not constitutionally problematic may  become
so, as the Bill before us now only allows certain citizens  who  are  abroad
for certain temporary purposes to vote, while depriving others who are in  a
similar situation from doing so. For  instance,  a  citizen  who  is  abroad
working on a temporary basis as  an  employee  will  not  be  able  to  take
advantage of this opportunity. The same will apply  to  all  South  Africans
who have been living abroad for an  extended  period  of  time.  It  may  be
problematic to  justify  such  differentiated  treatment.  It  may  also  be
problematic to administer this Bill as it may be difficult to judge  whether
somebody is, indeed, abroad on a temporary basis and to give meaning to  the
expression ``temporary'' under the various real-life circumstances.

As I have always spoken with candour to my colleagues in this House  and  in
the Cabinet, I felt that I should share these concerns. Yesterday, as I  was
coming here, I saw the headline for the KwaZulu-Natal newspaper,  the  Daily
News, was ``Lieu of sterling jobs:  Nurses,  teachers  double  their  pay''.
There was also a report which stated how many of  our  nurses  and  teachers
who are low earners in South Africa can earn up  to  double  their  salaries
abroad while enjoying unrivalled packages and attractive allowances.  Nurses
are paid around R220 000 a year in the UK. Teachers  are  paid  up  to  R350
000. Locum radiographers, in short supply both locally and  internationally,
can earn a whopping R550 000 a year, etc. It just crossed  my  mind  in  the
plane whether such people have the right to vote or not.

However,  objections  were  also  raised  against  the  use  of  the  phrase
``assistance  to  handicapped  voters''  in  the  long  title  of  the  Act.
Therefore, the amendments substitute the phrase ``assistance to  handicapped
voters'' in the long title of the  Act  with  ``assistance  to  voters  with
disabilities''.

I hope these amendments may  be  in  the  best  interests  of  our  fledging
democracy and may avert threats  of  legal  action,  which  could  have  the
effect of disrupting our preparations for  next  year's  elections.  I  urge
that this House accept the Electoral Laws Second  Amendment  Bill.  I  thank
you, hon Madam Deputy Speaker, and the House.

Mr H P CHAUKE: Thank you  very  much  Deputy  Speaker,  Ministers  and  MPs,
today, as we meet to debate  this  Electoral  Laws  Second  Amendment  Bill,
there are a number of areas that I want to raise.

During the deliberations in the portfolio committee, it was very clear  that
there were other organisations and individuals who were not happy  with  the
manner in which we had concluded clause 33. Hence the engagement  that  then
took place between other opposition parties and ordinary  members  with  the
President and ourselves. We then considered the position that  the  Minister
has just alluded to, that this clause needed to  be  amended,  and  we  have
done that accordingly.

What is currently contained in the clause is that only  South  Africans  who
have registered will be allowed to cast their votes, but  by  notifying  the
IEC within 15 days after the proclamation of election  day.  So,  it's  very
clear, Mr Minister, that we are quite flexible, and  we  take  into  account
free and fair elections and we are making sure that  we  don't  infringe  on
anyone's rights. Even those who will be going for their holidays  and  those
who are studying overseas, I think, are catered for as  the  Bill  currently
stands.

I think there are a number of areas, as we deal  with  this  Electoral  Laws
Second Amendment Bill, that we should not forget. The ID campaign  is  still
continuing. The allocation that was given to the department,  currently  R30
million, really emphasises the point that the  department  has  been  trying
very hard, in fact, together with other stakeholders, to make sure  that  we
provide the bar-coded ID books to the people so that they are able to vote.

I still want to make the call  that,  as  we  are  beginning  to  shape  our
electoral  system  and  all  that,  we  should  bear  in  mind  that   voter
registration is still continuing. The  IEC  has  announced  again  that,  in
January, they will allocate another two days for voter  registration,  which
is a call that all South Africans should be sure to take very seriously.

On that note, I just want to thank the Minister for the leadership  that  he
has given on  these  issues,  particularly  on  the  Electoral  Laws  Second
Amendment Bill. I know that, at some point, it was very tense, Mr  Minister,
but we really appreciate the support that you have given us.

Again, I thank the Deputy Minister for making sure  that  she  is  in  touch
with the portfolio committee and for making sure that these issues  do  come
to us. This Bill came  to  the  portfolio  committee  on  Thursday,  but  by
Friday,  we  had  passed  these  amendments.  So,  it  then  shows  you  the
commitment that we get from all the parties, that is, the DA, FF  Plus,  New
NP, ACDP and all the  parties  that  are  participating  in  this  portfolio
committee. They were very supportive, and we really appreciate  the  support
and the leadership that you have given in this particular area.

I also want to thank the department and specifically  the  Director-General,
regarding the role that he played with  his  staff  -  Malatji,  Tshabalala,
Mmabulo and others - in ensuring that  they  prepared  these  amendments  in
time. We were very worried at the beginning, Minister. As you know,  we  had
been saying that the delay would affect the preparations of the IEC for  the
elections. But we are very happy.

Obviously, other issues will come, but we are an  open  democracy.  We  will
listen to them as they come and take everybody's view  into  account  as  we
prepare these electoral amendments and systems in the country.

On that note, I would like to  thank  all  the  MPs,  the  Minister,  Deputy
Minister and everybody who made sure to  support  this  portfolio  committee
and its functions. I really thank you very much,  hon  members.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Agb Adjunkspeaker,  die  DA  sal  die  wetsontwerp  slegs
steun indien daar  geen  twyfel  daaroor  bestaan  dat  Suid-Afrikaners  wat
ingevolge 'n tweejaar-werkpermit tydelik in die buiteland werk  of  studeer,
daarop geregtig sal wees  om  te  kan  stem  nie.  'n  Verdere  vereiste  is
natuurlik dat hulle as kiesers geregistreer moet wees.

Alvorens die DA sy steun aan die wetsontwerp kan toesê,  moet  die  Minister
dan ondubbelsinnig die versekering gee dat die DA se interpretasie  van  die
wetsontwerp korrek is. Nou, ons het so pas  na  die  Minister  geluister  en
gehoor dat daar twyfel by hom bestaan of die  wetsontwerp  inderdaad  korrek
is. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die Minister het dit hier baie duidelik gestel, en dit het met die  koalisie
niks te doen nie, mnr  Durand.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  In  alle  geval,  ek  wil
verder gaan deur te sê die DA sal in dié omstandighede  buite  stemming  bly
en ons sal in die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies 'n  amendement  voorstel  om
die saak bo alle twyfel op te klaar. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Hon Deputy Speaker, the DA will only support the Bill  if
there is no doubt that South Africans who are  working  or  studying  abroad
temporarily in accordance with a two-year work permit will  be  entitled  to
vote. A further requirement is, of course, that they must be  registered  as
voters.

Before the DA can support the Bill, the Minister has to give an  unequivocal
assurance that the DA's interpretation of the  Bill  is  correct.  Well,  we
have just listened to the Minister and heard that  he  doubted  whether  the
Bill is, in fact, correct. [Interjections.]

The Minister stated this here very clearly, and it has nothing  to  do  with
the coalition, Mr Durand. [Interjections.]  In  any  event,  I  want  to  go
further and say that under these circumstances  the  DA  will  abstain  from
voting and we  shall  propose  an  amendment  in  the  National  Council  of
Provinces to resolve the matter beyond all doubt.]

The MINISTER  OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  while  interjections  are
allowed, I seriously can't hear. I'm struggling with the translation, and  I
really can't hear. It's drowned out by the noise.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please do interject, but  do  it  in
such a manner that the Minister can hear. Proceed, hon member.

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Adjunkspeaker, ek wil  voorts  redeneer  dat  die  DA  se
interpretasie inderdaad korrek is. As 'n mens egter die situasie in  oënskou
neem, is dit inderdaad 'n onnodige stuk wetgewing, nie omdat die DA nie  wil
hê Suid-Afrikaners wat tydelik in die buiteland is en geregistreer is,  moet
kan stem nie, maar omdat die ANC by 'n vorige geleentheid  die  voorgestelde
wetgewing nek omgedraai het. Dit was nie ons nie; dit was die ANC!  Die  ANC
se optrede tydens die bespreking van die Kieswet  op  26  September  vanjaar
was inderdaad skandalig.

Dit is elke Suid-Afrikaanse burger van 18 jaar  en  ouer  se  onvervreembare
reg om sy of haar stem te mag uitbring. Die meerderheidsparty speel  eintlik
speletjies met die stemreg van alle Suid-Afrikaners. Algemene stemreg is  ná
'n lang en bloedige stryd in 1994 verkry. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daarom rus  daar
op hierdie Regering 'n dure plig om toe te sien dat die reg om  te  stem  op
'n verantwoordelike wyse gereël word. Die Kieswet is ná die  ommeswaai  deur
die ANC in September vanjaar in omstredenheid gehul.  'n  Demokratiese  land
se kieswet behoort sover moontlik nie omstrede bepalings te bevat nie.

Nou sê die ANC twee kleinerige opposisiepartye se  sogenaamde  konstruktiewe
onderhandelings het die Regering oortuig om  die  wet  weer  eens  te  wysig
sodat Suid-Afrikaners wat tydelik in die buiteland is,  nou  sal  kan  stem.
Die VF Plus en die Nuwe NP is tevrede met die krummels wat  van  die  koning
se tafel val. Die DA is nie so naïef nie. Dis mos pure bog! As dit die  reël
in Suid-Afrika word dat opposisiepartye oor 'n  grondwetlike  reg  die  ANC-
regering moet soebat om dit toe te staan, is dit laat in die dag.

Stemreg is 'n fundamentele reg en  daarom  is  dit  nie  nodig  dat  daaroor
onderhandel word nie.  Die  ANC  is  inderdaad  besig  met  'n  rampspoedige
benadering. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek is nie bereid om vrae  te  beantwoord  nie.
Die DA, as die amptelike opposisie in die  Raad,  het  die  reg  om  hierdie
beginselsaak in 'n openbare debat aan te spreek. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Deputy Speaker, furthermore I  want  to  argue  that  the
DA's interpretation is, in fact,  correct.  However,  if  one  examines  the
situation,  one  sees  that  it  is,  in  fact,  an  unnecessary  piece   of
legislation, not because the  DA  does  not  want  South  Africans  who  are
temporarily abroad and who are registered voters, to be able  to  vote,  but
because the ANC squashed the proposed legislation on  a  previous  occasion.
It was not us; it was the ANC! The actions of the ANC during the  discussion
of the Electoral Act on 26 September this year were indeed scandalous.

It is the inalienable right of every South African citizen of  18  years  of
age and older to be allowed to cast his or her vote. The majority party  are
actually playing games with  the  right  to  vote  of  all  South  Africans.
Universal suffrage was obtained in 1994 after a long  and  bloody  struggle.
[Interjections.] For this reason this Government is duty bound to see to  it
that the right to vote is regulated in a responsible way. The Electoral  Act
has been controversial since the about-face by the  ANC  in  September  this
year. A democratic country's
Electoral  Act  should,  as  far  as  possible,  not  contain  controversial
clauses.

Now the ANC says the  so-called  constructive  negotiations  of  two  fairly
small opposition parties convinced the Government  to  amend  the  Act  once
again so that South Africans who are temporarily abroad will now be able  to
vote. The FF Plus and the New NP are satisfied  with  the  crumbs  from  the
king's table. The DA is not that naïve. Surely it is utter nonsense!  If  it
becomes the rule in South Africa that opposition parties should beg the  ANC
Government to grant a constitutional right, it is late in the day.

The right to vote is a fundamental right and  for  this  reason  it  is  not
necessary to negotiate about it. The ANC is in fact  adopting  a  disastrous
approach. [Interjections.] I am not prepared to answer  questions.  The  DA,
as the official opposition in the House,  has  the  right  to  address  this
matter of principle in a public debate.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Pretorius, will you please just  stop  for  a
while.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Is the hon member  prepared  to  answer  a  question
now?

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Nee! [No!]

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Is jy bang? [Are you afraid?]

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Dit is mos nie nodig om in privaatheid te onderhandel  oor
so 'n belangrike saak nie. [Surely it  is  not  necessary  to  negotiate  in
private about such an important matter.]

It's not necessary to discuss this matter in private. Let's  discuss  it  in
the open as we did then.

Dit  is  die  President  se  parlementêre  raadgewer  se  plig  om  hom  oor
verwikkelings in die Nasionale Vergadering op die hoogte  te  hou.  Die  agb
Sue van der Merwe is klaarblyklik besig om haar plig te versuim. Dit is  nie
die opposisie se  plig  om  mooi  broodjies  by  die  President  oor  so  'n
kardinale saak te bak nie. Die riglyne oor wie mag stem  staan  mos  in  die
Grondwet. Daar kan mos nie elke keer as daar 'n  krisis  ontstaan  eers  met
die President onderhandel word nie. Ek weet van geen ander  demokrasie  waar
dit die gebruik is nie.  Daarom  het  die  Kabinet  uiteindelik  'n  besluit
geneem; nie oor daardie ANC-vriendjies se bemiddeling nie, maar omdat  hulle
besef het hulle het 'n fout gemaak. Dit is die DA se onvervreembare  reg  om
so 'n saak namens die kiesers aan te spreek.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is the duty  of  the  President's  parliamentary  adviser  to  keep  him
abreast of developments in the National Assembly.  Apparently  the  hon  Sue
van der Merwe is neglecting her duty. It is not the duty of  the  opposition
to curry favour with the President about such a cardinal matter. Surely  the
guidelines about who are allowed to vote are  in  our  Constitution.  Surely
there cannot be negotiations with the President every time a crisis  arises.
I know of no other democracy where this is the  practice.  For  this  reason
the Cabinet eventually took a decision; not as a result of the mediation  of
those little ANC friends, but because they realised that  they  had  made  a
mistake. It is the inalienable right of the DA to address such a  matter  on
behalf of the voters. I thank you.]

Prince N E ZULU: Deputy Speaker, hon Minister of Home  Affairs,  Ndabezitha,
and colleagues, any law that ushers in a country's elections is,  indeed,  a
piece  of  cornerstone  legislation,  as  no  meaningful  democracy  can  be
realised without holding a valid, free and fair election.

Any  electoral  law  should  undergo  a  well-considered   and   synthesised
legislative process, and be given a sound mandate by political  parties  and
the electorate during public inputs at the time of public hearings.

The Bill before the House is an attempt  to  panelbeat  the  Electoral  Laws
Amendment Act, 2003, passed recently by this Parliament. The IFP  registered
a strong objection to that Bill, where it excluded a large section of  South
African citizens, who will temporarily be abroad,  from  voting  during  the
2004 elections. This was viewed in a serious light, as it violates one of  a
person's fundamental rights, the right to vote.

A new democracy such as ours could not afford to disenfranchise any  section
of its electorate. Thanks go to  those  who  sounded  the  alarm  bells,  Dr
Mulder, as mentioned by the Minister. In trying to correct this anomaly,  it
is said that the ANC component of the Portfolio Committee  on  Home  Affairs
was summoned by its principals to be given a directive on how to  deal  with
the amendment.

I believe this Parliament has not forgotten that, last year, the  Department
of Home Affairs presented to the nation a Bill on  immigration  which  ended
up, not only a patchwork from the ANC, but a complete redraft.  That  was  a
very unpleasant experience, and it caused a lot of  consternation  for  many
political quarrels.

Today, we are dealing with another Bill from Home Affairs,  which  has  gone
through  a  process  of  incomprehensive  panelbeating.  The  definition  of
temporary absence from the Republic is a cause for concern,  and  one  hopes
it is not going to arouse  a  constitutional  challenge  from  some  of  the
citizens who may wrongfully be affected by such a definition.

Thank you. The IFP supports the amendment.

Mr S PILLAY: Madam Speaker, it is the constitutional right  of  every  South
African to register as a voter and to vote. Therefore, the New  NP  supports
the provision of the Bill that is before us.

Much debate took place within Parliament and in many parts of  the  country,
and the common goal was established regarding how to ensure that  all  South
Africans who are outside the country on a temporary basis would  have  their
right to vote protected and enabled. The acceptance  of  this  Bill  by  the
House ensures that.

The  Independent  Electoral  Commission  now  has  the  difficult  task   to
implement this piece of legislation,  and  will  have  to  ensure  that  the
integrity of all procedures,  including  transportation  of  ballot  papers,
remains intact. It is an excellent example of what can be achieved when  all
parties work together to achieve a common goal that benefits the country.

This was achieved because specific political parties, such as  the  New  NP,
engaged constructively with the ruling party and the Government. It  clearly
indicates that much more can be achieved when we have a common  vision.  The
one test that is still to come is: How to deal  with  all  the  millions  of
people in the country who have not registered to vote? We  must  not  forget
that there are still a huge number of people living in the country  that  do
not have identity documents and will, therefore, not  be  able  to  vote  if
this matter is not remedied.
I hope that the zeal, energy and effort that  some  parties,  including  the
New NP, put into ensuring that people outside of the country on a  temporary
basis are able to vote, will be applied in  equal  measure  to  ensure  that
people inside the country are also empowered to vote. Are we  expecting  too
much in that regard? If that does not happen, it  will  be  a  tragedy  -  a
tragedy that history will remember to our discredit. However,  we  will  not
be surprised if some parties choose to ignore the will of the people in  the
country ...

... ngoba kukhona abantu abathi uma bekuleli zwe bakhulume lokhu  kodwa  uma
bephesheya bakhuluma okunye, baphikise lokhu  akade  bekusho  lapha  ekhaya.
Ngalokho-ke,   bangamashayakhothe.   Kuyasimangaza   ukuthi   yini   inhloso
yamashayakhothe. Lapho engakhulela khona, uma sibona  umuntu  oyishayakhothe
sasimhlalisa phansi simbuze umbuzo owodwa vo. Umbuzo uthi:  Sawubona  fishi;
uphume nini ethinini? Ngiyabonga. [Uhleko.] (Translation of  Zulu  paragraph
follows.)

[... because there are people who say  one  thing  when  they  are  in  this
country but then contradict themselves when they speak abroad. When they  do
that they show that they are two-faced. We just wonder what the aim of  two-
faced people is. In the village of  my  childhood  whenever  we  encountered
such people we would sit them down and say: Hello there, where on  earth  do
you hail from? Thank you.] [Laughter.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker, the ACDP has been one of the parties  at
the forefront of the campaign to allow overseas citizens  to  vote.  It  has
been the first party to raise the issue  in  the  portfolio  committee,  and
elicited  petitions  from  South  African  citizens  in  27   countries   in
supporting their right to vote.

We also engaged legal counsel to advise us as to  the  constitutionality  of
the exclusion of the overseas voters. We, consequently, support  the  latest
amendment to  the  Electoral  Act  to  allow  persons  who  are  temporarily
overseas to vote in next year's elections. South Africans are  operating  in
a global environment and there's no reason why  those  temporarily  overseas
should be denied the opportunity to vote. We also, however,  share  concerns
as to the exact definition as to who is covered by the phrase  ``temporarily
abroad''.

In conclusion, we support the majority party in its stand  against  allowing
convicted prisoners  the  right  to  vote.  It  will  be  unacceptable  that
thousands of South Africans, law-abiding citizens overseas who do  not  fall
within the categories contained in today's amendment, will not be  permitted
to vote whilst convicted prisoners will be allowed to do so. I thank you.

Dr C P MULDER: Deputy Speaker, failure is a stepchild but success  has  many
fathers. Today we saw how many fathers tried to claim the success, even  the
DA.

The legislative provisions that stipulate the rules  for  the  election  are
central to the question: Is it a true democracy or not? Remember, the  right
to vote is the most basic and fundamental right that lies at  the  heart  of
any democracy.

For more than two years now, the FF has been championing the cause of  South
African citizens who are temporarily outside the borders  of  the  Republic.
Many young South Africans from all communities are temporarily abroad.  Many
of them are on two-year Commonwealth working holiday visas. They  pay  their
taxes in South Africa and they are determined to  return  home  as  soon  as
possible.

We have had petitions signed, we made representations  to  the  authorities,
we argued in the portfolio  committee,  and  we  made  personal  and  public
appeals. Sometimes we succeeded and sometimes we failed.  The  fact  is,  we
kept on even after many  others,  like  the  DA,  abandoned  this  cause  as
hopeless. Even after the Bill was signed by President Mbeki, we kept on.  We
never gave up. We did this because we believed that our cause was  just  and
that the Bill was unconstitutional. In the end, common sense and  logic  did
prevail.

Two months ago, we passed the rules for our election in 2004 in this  House.
Those rules stipulated that those South Africans would not  have  been  able
to  vote.  Today  we  are  changing  those  provisions  to  allow  them   to
participate in the 2004 election. When it became clear that  we  were  going
to succeed, many tried to claim this as their  victory  -  once  again,  the
poor DA.

Today I would like to thank  the  hon  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  who  was
prepared to speak the truth. He said in this House and I quote: ``It is  not
because of the DA, it is because of the constructive intervention of the  FF
Plus.''

We  will  support  this  Bill  and  we  will  follow  the  regulations   and
implementation of these provisions very closely.  We  are  not  out  of  the
woods yet. There are certain uncertainties  and  we  have  to  look  at  the
wording in that respect.

Oops! I almost forgot - there is one more thing. Exactly two months ago,  on
26  September,  we  debated  the  issue  of  the  constitutionality  of  the
Electoral Laws Amendment Bill in this very House. I  then  argued  that  the
Bill  was  unconstitutional  because,  for  all   practical   purposes,   it
disenfranchised South African citizens who would be abroad on  polling  day.
I gave my motivation for this in my speech.

The honour, on behalf of the ANC, to respond to the debate went to  the  hon
Piet Mathebe. In  one  of  the  worst  speeches  I've  ever  heard  in  this
Parliament, he dealt with mine and  other  arguments.  His  response  to  my
claim of unconstitutionality was the following, and I quote:


  Now, Chairperson, coming to the hon Dr Mulder, really, after listening to
  what he was saying here, one is obliged to think that he can  only  be  a
  doctor of animals.

Maybe, just maybe, hon Mathebe could have been saved from the  embarrassment
if someone from the ANC had informed him that I am not a doctor  of  animals
but a doctor of constitutional law. Thank you.
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker and hon members, the UCDP will  support  the
Bill as it answers to our objection thereto in September. We, however,  call
on the ANC not to be obsessed with their majority, in this House and in  the
committee, and overturn agreements arrived at. Were it not for the  airs  of
the ANC, there would be no  need  for  this  debate  as  the  amendment  was
proposed by the IEC at the committee stage and was agreed to, only  for  the
ANC to make an about-face later and then  use  their  numbers  to  lead  the
nation in a merry-go-round.

In the  words  of  the  President,  legislators  must  legislate  and  leave
execution to the executive. Members of Parliament must  be  on  the  lookout
and not let the President do their work. It  is  something  which  we  shall
regret,  if  it  persists.  We  are  grateful  that  the  President,   after
persuasion,  though,  showed  his   mettle   and   put   a   stop   to   the
disenfranchisement of South Africans abroad. The UCDP supports the Bill.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Deputy Speaker, the PAC supports  this  amendment.  The
substitution of the words ``handicapped voters''  with  the  words  ``voters
with disabilities'' is a clear improvement and should be supported by all.

The amendment of section 33 of the Electoral Act to allow South Africans  on
holiday, and other categories of South Africans who are abroad, to  vote  is
also accepted by the PAC. Our only comment is that the  amendment  does  not
go far enough. It ought to be extended to all legitimate South Africans  who
hold South African passports and live abroad.

There are South Africans, for instance, who became  refugees  and  who  were
employed abroad and cannot return to this country without  forfeiting  their
pensions and investments. Such people  feel  that  they  are  part  of  this
country and also feel that to be excluded from  voting  is  a  painful  blow
from their country. We have nothing to lose or fear by  enfranchising  them.
Thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  MF  has  no  objection  to  the
amendments made in the Electoral Laws  Second  Amendment  Bill,  and  agrees
that the  phrase  ``handicapped  voters''  is  politically  insensitive  and
totally inappropriate to use. The proposed  substitution  for  this  phrase,
namely, ``voters with disabilities'' is both respectable and appropriate  in
use.

The MF has concerns about citizens abroad and their right to vote.  We  have
no objection to  this  provision  being  extended  only  to  those  who  are
temporarily absent and yet who are registered to vote. The duty placed  upon
such citizens to inform the electoral commission of their voting  intentions
should be a Government duty too, so as to ensure that  such  people  are  in
some way notified or made aware of such a process  concerning  their  votes.
The MF supports the Bill. Thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

Ms ANNALIZé VAN WYK: Madam Deputy Speaker, in many  debates  in  this  House
our opposition is trying to create the impression, especially when it is  TV
time, that the ANC  uses  its  majority  in  order  to  steamroll  decisions
through. This House and the voters are told that the ANC does not listen  to
others' arguments. We are subjected to continuous criticism, but few if  any
alternatives are suggested. We see political parties, the size  of  the  DA,
acting the size of their inflated egos.

Throughout its 10 years  of  government  the  ANC  has  tried  to  encourage
political parties to engage  constructively  instead  of  blowing  hot  air.
Today we have seen more of the same. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Is u op die ANC se lys vir die verkiesing? [Are  you  on  the
ANC's list for the election?]

Ms A VAN WYK: I need to respond to a few issues. The first  is  that  it  is
not true that teachers and nurses who are not  here  will  not  be  able  to
vote. The truth is that no South African who is temporarily abroad  will  be
disenfranchised. There are only two requirements: that they are  abroad  for
a limited period of time  and  that  they  have  been  registered  and  have
alerted the IEC.

In the case of those who are living abroad  permanently,  their  rights  are
indeed limited, which is  in  line  with  our  Constitution.  They  have  no
interest in South Africa, nor are they planning to come back. They  are  not
paying taxes here either. [Interjections.] Why should  they  be  allowed  to
vote? We need to focus our resources  and  we  will  not  deviate  from  our
priorities.

Its amazing that some political parties seem to know more than the ANC  does
about what's happening within the ANC. We were not summoned to any  meeting.
We were not whipped, as Mr Pretorius put it in certain  media  releases,  by
party authorities to make this change. The only whipping that seems to  have
taken place seems  to  have  happened  in  the  DA,  because  on  Friday  he
supported this amendment in the committee. [Applause.]

It's  also  important  that  the  FF  Plus  notes  that  this  Bill  is  not
unconstitutional.  It  was  tested  before,  to  see  whether  it  would  be
unconstitutional to limit the  rights  of  South  Africans  abroad  and  the
Constitutional Court made a clear decision in that regard,  and  we  believe
that this Bill provides for that.  Despite  having  a  Constitutional  Court
ruling in our back pockets, which says  it's  not  unconstitutional  not  to
allow South Africans abroad to vote, the ANC proposed the amendment  as  set
out before the House.

There were  basically  three  reasons  why  we  introduced  the  amendments.
Firstly, yes, some constructive discussions did take place between the  ANC,
the FF Plus and the New NP. The ANC listened  and  decided  that  there  was
merit in the request that was put before it. A political party  that  ceases
to reconsider its opinion is a menace to a democratic community.

Secondly, the ANC is serious about nation-building  and  reconciliation.  We
believe that by allowing as many South Africans as possible  to  participate
in  an  election,  each  and  every  South  African  is  provided  with  the
opportunity to  constructively  participate  in  the  democratic  processes.
There is therefore no need for anyone to be alienated or to find  themselves
on the fringes of society. As long as they subscribe to  the  principles  of
democracy, they have the opportunity to participate in  decisions  affecting
the country, none of which is more important than participating in  deciding
who must govern our country for the next five years.

Thirdly, there is the question of free and fair  elections.  Free  and  fair
elections are one of the cornerstones of democracy, and in one as  young  as
ours we need to nurture it by widening the democratic process  and  ensuring
maximum  participation.  By  allowing  those  South   Africans   abroad   to
participate in elections, we are doing exactly that. The  ANC  brought  this
amendment because we believe that it was the  right  thing  to  do  for  our
country, its people and democracy.

What needs to happen now is for South Africans who qualify to  make  use  of
this opportunity to inform the IEC of their intention to  vote  abroad.  The
ANC also calls on its many supporters abroad to celebrate  with  us  our  10
years of freedom and to ensure that they vote in their  thousands.  I  would
also like to make use of the opportunity to repeat the  call  to  those  who
still do not have bar-coded IDs  to  go  and  apply  for  them  as  soon  as
possible.

While for parties such as the DA the need for identity documents is  limited
to the elections every five years, it is important that all  people  realise
that their identity as South Africans gives them  access  to  indiscriminate
Government  services.  There  can  be  no  daily  democracy  without   daily
citizenship. You won't be  able  to  understand  me,  in  any  case,  in  an
instance such as this.

Anybody  who  cares  about  the  livelihood  of  people  should  assist   as
volunteers, as facilitators and communicators to ensure  that  people  apply
for their identity documents. Those political parties that  make  themselves
guilty of hindering access  to  services  by  those  they  believe  are  not
supporting them politically should stop doing so as we  will  come  down  on
them with all the might of the law.

The ANC would also like to urge people to  continue  to  register,  if  they
have not done so yet. Those who have  not  registered  and  who  have  moved
since the last elections should go and do so at  municipal  offices  without
delay. Even if you are not sure who you want to support at  this  stage,  do
not disenfranchise yourself by not registering. With this, the ANC  supports
the amending Bill before the House.

I cannot but respond to the continuous screaming as to whether I am  on  the
ANC list or not. The fact of the matter is: when I moved to the  ANC  I  did
so out of a principled decision, and that is not something I expect  the  DA
to understand because ``principle'' is not in their vocabulary. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would  like  to  thank
all the hon members who have actually participated in this  debate  on  this
electoral amendment.

An HON MEMBER: Except the DA.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Well, I'm not your puppet. When I'm  here  I'm
speaking for myself. I don't need your wisdom. [Applause.]
I would like to thank all the members. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, I just wish  to  clarify  that  this
Bill amends the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill which was passed earlier  this
year.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (Democratic Alliance abstaining).

   CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN
     CUSTOMS UNION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF
 BOTSWANA, THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO, THE REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA, THE REPUBLIC OF
                  SOUTH AFRICA AND THE KINGDOM OF SWAZILAND

Mr R H DAVIES: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Southern African Customs  Union  is
an arrangement that had its origins in colonial economic relations. It  took
shape at the end of the 19th century, and was first formalised in 1910  when
the Union of South Africa was part  of  the  British  Empire  and  Botswana,
Lesotho and Swaziland were administered from South  Africa  by  the  British
High Commissioner.

The 1910 SACU arrangement encapsulated both the  integration  into  and  the
subordination within  an  emerging  Southern  African  region  or  political
economy of the so-called  high  commission  territories.  These  territories
were drawn into  a  South  African  dominated  regional  political  economy;
fundamentally as labour reserves to supply  cheap  migrant  labour  for  the
mining industry, but also as captive markets for South African goods.

The 1910 arrangement provided both for  the  duty  free  movement  of  goods
within the common customs area and for the extension of tariffs in force  in
South Africa, and set by  South  Africa  alone,  to  Botswana,  Lesotho  and
Swaziland. Namibia was incorporated on the same basis after  that  territory
was seized from the Germans in the First World War.

It is worth recording that the architect of the apartheid grand  design,  Dr
Verwoerd, had  ambitions  to  formally  incorporate  Botswana,  Lesotho  and
Swaziland into South Africa. Verwoerd's  basic  idea  was  premised  on  the
absurd proposition that if the Kalahari Desert was incorporated  into  South
Africa,  the  proportion  of  land  allocated  to  black  people  under  the
apartheid grand design would appear - even if it would not in reality  be  -
more equitable than the well-known 13:87% division of the territory.

Fortunately,  this  ambition  was  thwarted  and   Botswana,   Lesotho   and
Swaziland,  BLS,  became  independent  in  the  late  sixties.  After  their
independence BLS negotiated an essentially pragmatic arrangement with  South
Africa which came into force in 1969. It retained  a  customs  union  and  a
common external tariff.

The 1969 agreement extended the  arrangement  under  which  the  tariffs  in
force in South Africa, and set  by  South  Africa,  applied  throughout  the
customs union. In return for the loss of sovereignty that this implied,  and
also the price raising effects that resulted from being drawn  behind  South
Africa's highly protective tariff walls,  Botswana,  Lesotho  and  Swaziland
were guaranteed a  disproportionate  share  of  common  customs  and  excise
revenue.

The deal was essentially one in which South  Africa  secured  a  small,  but
significant, captive market for  its  domestic  industries,  and  in  return
provided a guaranteed revenue stream - which was of  significant  importance
for the fiscuses of those countries.

There was enough in this agreement for it to survive,  but  it  was  not  an
arrangement that really satisfied either side,  as  evidenced  both  by  the
complaints  from  Botswana,  Lesotho  and  Swaziland  about  South  Africa's
predatory trade practices,  and  the  previous  South  African  government's
complaints about revenue transfers. Nor did the 1969 agreement  provide  any
basis for the  promotion  of  the  kind  of  equitable  development  focused
integration that has repeatedly been identified as fundamental  for  African
development.

The agreement before us today is  the  product  of  nearly  eight  years  of
negotiation, beginning after our own democratic  transition  in  1994,  that
has sought to address itself precisely to  such  questions.  While  the  new
agreement retains a number of key elements of the 1969 arrangement,  notably
a customs union and a revenue sharing arrangement asymmetrically  tilted  in
favour of smaller economies, it also  revolutionises  the  way  the  customs
union is operated, and creates the basis for SACU to become  a  vehicle  for
equitable integration. The 2002 agreement we  are  asked  to  ratify  today,
provides for joint decision-making on tariffs and related matters in  common
SACU institutions.

When this Parliament adopted  the  International  Trade  Administration  Act
last year, we reiterated that the principle  of  mutually  beneficial  joint
decision-making must also apply to our relations with SACU.  At  that  time,
the Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry reported to the House that  in
public hearings on  that  Bill,  both  business  and  labour  had  expressed
concerns about procedures  for  joint  decision-making  in  connection  with
trade remedies, anti-dumping, safeguards and implementation  of  provisional
remedies.

At the time we said these concerns,  while  legitimate,  would  have  to  be
accomodated within a framework of joint  decision-making.  In  the  hearings
for ratification of the present agreement, our committee was presented  with
two proposed annexures to the SACU agreement  on  the  role  of  the  tariff
board and national bodies. We were informed that there was a high  level  of
agreement among Nedlac partners on these,  and  also  that  they  have  been
positively received amongst SACU partners.

We believe that this offers a basis for us to proceed with the  ratification
today, and I have pleasure in commending this agreement to the House.  Thank
you. [Applause.]

Mr C M LOWE: Madam Speaker, although  the  Southern  African  Customs  Union
agreement originated in 1910 as a trade agreement between the then Union  of
South Africa and the so-called high commission territories of  Bechuanaland,
Basutoland and Swaziland, as we have heard, it was only in  1994,  with  the
transition to a democratic South Africa, that serious negotiations around  a
customs union  for  these  countries,  which  all  share  in  an  integrated
regional economy, could begin.

In October 2001, the respective SACU Ministers  of  Botswana,  Lesotho,  the
Republic of South Africa, Swaziland and Namibia, which  joined  the  customs
union in 1990, agreed on a  new  agreement,  which  was  then  approved,  in
principle, by the heads of state in October 2002.

How unfortunate that South Africa's rebirth as a free and democratic  state,
paving the way for a new SACU agreement,  has  not  been  accompanied  by  a
similar path to democracy in human rights for the people of Swaziland.  That
journey to democracy for Swaziland must now begin, and the DA believes  that
it must be one of SACU's most important  priorities,  especially,  Minister,
for the Republic of South Africa. This new agreement is  an  important  step
forward in the improving of the customs union and establishing  a  means  to
integrate member states' economies into the global economy.

Today's debate takes place against the background of other  important  trade
negotiations. Submissions to the portfolio committee at its public  hearings
indicated  that  the   new   agreement   has   important   innovations   and
improvements. It establishes regional  institutions  and  creates  a  rules-
based system to effectively carry out trade and assimilation amongst  member
states.

It is important to note that this agreement is only a  framework  agreement,
and that subsequent annexures and other legal instruments will be  drawn  up
and added to it from time to time. This will enable us to  take  account  of
the fact that the SACU is presently also engaged in  negotiations  for  free
trade agreements with the United States,  Efta  and  Mercosur,  and  intends
opening negotiations with India and China in the near future.

It may also be necessary because the present SACU agreement  does  not  have
jurisdiction over matters like trade, services and investment,  which  could
complicate matters should the agreement be cast in stone, and  perhaps  even
impact on SACU's own regional integration agenda.  Therefore,  the  approval
of the agreement  by  the  Parliament  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa,
together with its ratification by the member states,  is  necessary,  if  we
are to achieve the objectives that  will  allow  for  a  new  basis  of  co-
operation amongst these countries, in line  with  their  constitutional  and
democratical ideals.

No objective is more important than extending  those  democratic  ideals  to
Swaziland as well - as one of the original SACU member states from 1910.  It
alone has rebuffed the freedoms and democratic principles  that  have  swept
across this continent and region.

We cannot ignore this anachronism any  longer.  It  is  simply  unacceptable
that the Swazi people, particularly women  and  girls,  remain  enslaved  in
feudal servitude without human rights or recourse to the rule of  law  under
an  absolute  mornachy  without  any  parliamentary  democracy;  let   alone
parliamentary opposition and institutions which we now take for  granted  in
South Africa.

This is a trade agreement, and I acknowledge that.  But  SACU  offers  great
hope and promise for trade in the region. I believe it offers great hope  to
the people of Swaziland as well. Thank you.

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker and hon members, at the outset I  would  just
like to say that I am filling in for the hon Mr Ngiba who  is  a  member  of
the Trade and Industry Portfolio Committee and is unable to  participate  in
this debate. The hon Davies has given us an eloquent historical  account  of
the Southern African Customs Union and I am not going to repeat what he  has
said.

The IFP expresses its support for the SACU and realises  that  South  Africa
needs  a  more  competitive  and  effective  customs  union  which  the  new
agreement favours. We believe that regional economic  integration  is  vital
for free trade, as well as to address unfair  trade  practices  and  provide
for improved customs and tariffs.
We also realise that growth and development are not enough. There has to  be
investment. So, we  will  support  cross-border  free  trade  and  we  would
endorse the report. However, hon Minister, we  would  like  you  to  address
some of Sacob's concerns. I believe that Sacob  graced  the  committee  with
their presence and elucidated some of the problems or  grey  areas.  Perhaps
the  Minister  can  allay  their  fears.  Some  of   these   areas   include
protectionism,  the  complex  web  of  restrictions,  protection  of  infant
industries and other lacunae in agreements such as duplication.

With these few words the IFP voices its support for the report.  We  believe
it is a step in the right direction and it is  something  that  we  have  to
support and it is all part of co-operative governance.

Ms C C SEPTEMBER: Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me first of all, on behalf  of
the ANC, to wish all Muslims a joyous Eid Mubarak today. As stated  already,
the present SACU can be traced back to the  1889  Customs  Union  Convention
between the Colony of the Cape of Good  Hope  and  the  Orange  Free  State.
Lesotho, that was then called Basutoland, joined the union on  1  July  1891
and Botswana, that was then called Bechuanaland on 1  July  1893.  Swaziland
acceded to the union on 11 October 1904.

We need to place the SACU Agreement in its political context.  By  the  mid-
90s SACU members recognised that  the  agreement  did  not  encourage  great
economic  integration.  During  the  period  from  1969  to  1994  the  SACU
Agreement provided a framework for trade but not for regional integration.

The new agreement aims to make SACU democratic and it  creates  a  framework
to develop common sectorial policies to  further  harmonise  trade  policies
and to address the needs of all members. There  were  six  central  problems
with the 1969 agreement, namely: It  was  undemocratic  in  decision-making;
there was a resultant loss of  fiscal  discretion  by  the  BLNS  countries;
there were price-raising effects; there was industrial  polarisation;  there
was a decline in the share of revenue for South Africa; and,  lastly,  there
were time lags in the dispersing of revenue to the BLNS countries.

Whereas import duties were intended to protect  Southern  African  producers
from non-SACU competition, these duties could raise  the  price  of  imports
from  the  BLNS.  Industrial  polarisation  resulted  from  the  fact   that
industries serving the customs union market were located primarily in  South
Africa. In order to  address  the  problem  relating  to  the  time  lag  in
payments, initially estimated amounts were calculated and  remitted  in  the
year that the payment was due and were revised  when  final  data  was  made
available two years later.

The new SACU Agreement seeks to address all the  shortcomings  of  the  1969
Agreement. It provides for democratic decision-making through a  council  of
Ministers. It reconfigures what was essentially a  colonial,  apartheid  and
undemocratic arrangement. It further furnishes it with democratic  decision-
making and consultation and  establishes  new  institutions  of  governance.
There is a sound basis for revenue-sharing and it  creates  a  platform  for
deeper  integration,  common  policies   in   the   industry,   agriculture,
competition and anticompetitive practices.

The  agreement  sets  out  a  framework  or  guidelines  that  are   largely
nonprescriptive but a basis for further elaboration  including  through  the
annexures. The new  revenue  formula  provides  a  better  basis  for  South
Africa. The shares are now established for all members,  with  South  Africa
receiving about 50% of  the  pool,  somewhat  greater  than  under  the  old
formula.

Under the new formula South Africa will get R13,5 billion in 2004-05 and  in
2005-06 it will get about 55%. Under the new  agreement  South  Africa  will
receive a share which in our projected calculations should stabilise  around
55% of the total pool of about R23,8 billion. South Africa should be  better
off under the new formula.

In  conclusion,  it  is  important  to  understand  that  the  objective  of
renegotiating the SACU Agreement is to restore the integrity of the  Customs
Union in recognition of the fact that, taken  together,  Botswana,  Lesotho,
Namibia, Swaziland and South Africa constitute a single market.

The ANC supports this agreement. [Applause.]

Dr R T RHODA: Madam Deputy Speaker, as the hon member Connie  September  has
just stated, the SACU Agreement dates back to 1910. This  new  agreement  is
an  important  development  for  enhancing  and  creating  a  framework  for
integrating the economies of the member  states  into  the  global  economy,
globally changing the old landscape and levelling the playing fields  so  to
speak.

The new agreement also contains very  important  innovations  in  comparison
with the SACU Agreement of 1969. It  will  establish  regional  institutions
and will allow  for  a  rule-based  system  to  conduct  trade  and  further
integration amongst member states.

The main implications of the new agreement are, amongst  others,  and  I  do
not know if I have time to discuss them all, South  Africa  will  relinquish
its dominant position in SACU. The council of Ministers which represent  all
the SACU member states will make final decisions on all matters  related  to
SACU in a democratic manner.

A more equitable and sustainable revenue-sharing formula  will  replace  the
destabilisation  of  South  Africa's  SACU  partners.   The   rather   loose
relationship that, at present, exists between SACU members will be  replaced
by a coherent organisation with appropriate democratic  institutions  and  a
secretariate to administer and co-ordinate the operations of the new SACU.

The large difference in economic development between South  Africa  and  the
other member states is recognised and certain provisions  in  the  agreement
represent an effort to  address  the  problem.  There  is  thus  a  movement
towards policy harmonisation and co-ordination that  was  not  part  of  the
1969 agreement.

The New NNP supports the agreement. [Applause.]
Miss  S  RAJBALLY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  being  eager  to  build  better
relations throughout Africa, the MF approves the  Southern  African  Customs
Union Agreement between  the  governments  of  Botswana,  Lesotho,  Namibia,
South Africa and Swaziland.  We  especially  support  it  in  terms  of  the
approval of section 231(2) of our National  Constitution  which  we  respect
and uphold as the supreme law.

We have confidence in our departments and Portfolio Commitee  on  Trade  and
Industry in guiding South Africa  to  greater  success  and  growth  in  the
sector. A stronger relationship  with  Africa  would  make  for  a  stronger
Africa on the global market. Africa has an affluent supply that will  enable
stronger markets.  The  MF  supports  the  Southern  African  Customs  Union
Agreement. Thank you. [Applause.]

Prof B TUROK: Deputy Speaker, as  we  listen  to  colleagues  from  the  ANC
giving the historical background to this particular  agreement,  one  cannot
but be struck by the difference between the conditions when  this  agreement
was put in place and the conditions that exist across the  whole  of  Africa
today.

One  is  really  fascinated  by  the  difference  historically  between  the
conditions in which  we  operate  and  in  which  this  agreement  is  being
discussed, and the conditions that obtained in  the  period  of  colonialism
and the birth of apartheid when these neighbouring  countries  were  treated
as countries where certain interests  in  South  Africa  could  operate  for
their own benefit.

Today Sacu is being discussed in the context of African integration, and  in
the period of Nepad, when the harmonisation and  co-ordination  of  all  our
economic activities right across the continent is a priority.  This  process
fits in with the discussions that are now taking place in the African  Union
and in the context of the creation of the Pan-African  Parliament,  when  we
ourselves  will  have  a  say  as  Parliament  in  the  discussions   around
integration, co-ordination and harmonisation across the whole continent.

It is therefore appropriate that this agreement should  make  provision  for
the new conditions in which co-operation in the region will  take  place  at
ministerial level, rather than at the level of officials only. We  certainly
need new political mechanisms for discussions.  We  need  a  new  democratic
approach  to  the  whole  question  of  trade,  customs  agreements,  excise
agreements and  also  the  development  aspect  which  is  built  into  this
particular agreement.

We also understand that we need a  new  sound  basis  for  revenue  sharing.
Revenues for the neighbouring countries, which are based only on tariffs  or
primarily  on  tariffs,  cannot  fly  in  the  new  world   environment   of
globalisation. We must discuss with our neighbours new  methods  of  raising
revenue and not only tariffs alone.

We also consider the question of capacity. Certainly,  there  are  different
levels of capacity between South Africa and some of our neighbours,  and  we
are taking action to address that. For example, the SA Revenue  Service  has
been visiting our neighbours to advise  them  on  mechanisms  for  improving
revenue  collection.  Our  Competition  Commission,  similarly,   has   been
visiting our neighbours and there have been discussions about how  they  can
improve  their  own  functioning.  So,  in  general,   the   whole   process
incorporates methods and  procedures  which  will  streamline  the  way  our
neighbours and ourselves process the mechanisms of revenue  collection,  and
this is very important.

This also includes timeframes to ensure that these discussions do not go  on
forever. They have been dragging on. We have been told that  this  agreement
has been in progress for eight years. That must now be speeded up.  We  need
efficiency in this area,  and  South  African  business,  particularly,  was
concerned about that aspect. We trust that the new agreement will take  care
of that.

We must also create the proper foundation for  regional  integration.  There
has been some concern expressed through the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade
and Industry that with the opening up of the whole region, there  may  be  a
movement of  some  firms  from  high-labour-cost  areas  to  low-labour-cost
areas.

However, we have the  view  that  anyone  who  invests  in  industries,  and
manufacturing industries in particular, in our  neighbouring  countries  for
labour-cost  reasons  alone,  is  taking  a  very  narrow  view.  In   fact,
industrialisation and the birth of manufacturing capacity in the  region  as
a whole depend not  simply  on  low  labour  costs,  but  on  all  sorts  of
considerations including the capacity of a particular country to  support  a
particular industry, the question of demand in  a  particular  country,  and
it's not labour costs alone which matter.

Therefore we feel fairly confident that this agreement will indeed create  a
basis for regional integration of a more sophisticated kind than existed  in
the period of colonialism and in the days of  apartheid,  that  it  will  be
equitable, that it will be democratic and, above all, that it will help  the
building  blocks  upon  which  the  new  African  Union  is  based  and  the
conditions in which Nepad can flourish. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  would  like  to
begin by thanking my colleagues in the portfolio committee for the  detailed
and very accurate descriptions they  have  given,  of  the  history  of  the
agreement,  the  contents  of  the  recent  agreement  and  the  process  of
negotiation. I would also like to thank all the parties that have  supported
this agreement - and all parties have indeed supported it. I think  this  is
a very strong and positive statement too, about  our  commitment  to  Africa
and particularly our commitment to  our  closest  neighbours,  the  Southern
African Customs Union.

I would agree with all speakers: This is,  I  believe,  a  very  significant
agreement  indeed.  It  is,  if  you  look  at  it,  a  very  advanced   and
sophisticated form of economic integration. The fact that we have been  able
to set this  up  does  bode  very  well,  I  believe,  for  future  economic
integration in Africa, which is inevitable.
One of the main reasons we took so long  to  renegotiate  the  agreement  is
precisely  because  of  the  fiscal  and  budgetary  implications  that  the
agreement has for our neighbours. Quite clearly, all of our neighbours  were
concerned that the revenue flows from  the  agreement  would  be  stable.  I
believe in working with the National Treasury and the Minister  of  Finance,
Trevor Manuel. We were able to fashion a formula on revenue  sharing,  which
embodies two very important principles.

One is that the formula would not destabilise any of  the  fiscal  positions
of any country - and South Africa  has  in  recent  years  had  considerable
aspects of instability introduced into its planning - but at the  same  time
would ensure that the smaller economies  effectively  have  a  developmental
transfer to stabilise their  revenue  shares.  I  believe  this  is  a  very
important aspect and was the most difficult of the aspects to negotiate.

The structures of  co-operative  decision-making  were  somewhat  easier  to
negotiate, but I believe are very profound indeed in bringing  together  the
various council  structures  that  will  now  jointly  administer  and  make
decisions in regard to SACU.

I would like, in this  House,  also  to  extend  particular  thanks  to  the
Minister of Finance, Minister Gaolathe from Botswana. He and his  team  from
the national treasury in Botswana played a  very,  very  important  role  in
facilitating the final stages of this negotiation, and actually  piloted  it
through.

I believe this also indicated, to all of us in the customs union,  that  the
capacity to participate is indeed growing. Business has  expressed  concerns
about whether such a  large  structure  would  be  able  to  make  decisions
relatively  quickly.  I  believe  that  we  will  be  able  to  do  so.  The
transformation of the  International  Trade  Administration  Commission  was
precisely designed to give us the room and the space to make decisions  more
effectively, within the customs union.

Speakers have also pointed to the fact that we now negotiate as a bloc.  The
Southern African Customs Union is a common negotiating  bloc,  and  we  have
now embarked on some extremely large  and  important  negotiations.  Jointly
with United States, we embarked on  negotiations  with  Microsoft,  and  the
customs union Ministers and the cabinets  of  the  different  countries  are
considering proposed negotiations with India  and  China.  So  there  is  no
question that the degree of integration and common  action  is  rising  very
rapidly in the customs union.

Let me conclude by also saying that a careful look at the agreement, as  has
been pointed out by the hon member Lowe and others, shows  that  this  is  a
framework agreement. If you look at  it,  you  will  see  that  it  actually
points the way to deeper economic integration  through  the  harmonising  of
various  policies:  competition  policy,  agricultural  policy,   industrial
policy. And it is inevitable that this  will  take  us  along  the  path  of
something  approximating  a  full-fledged   economic   union   between   our
countries.

I would like, once again, to thank  the  portfolio  committee  for  piloting
this  through,  for  holding  the  hearings,  and  thank  all  parties   for
supporting what I believe is a very historic agreement indeed, on  the  path
towards economic integration in Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Southern African Customs Union Agreement  between  the  Governments  of  the
Republic of Botswana, the Kingdom of Lesotho, the Republic of  Namibia,  The
Republic of South Africa and the Kingdom of Swaziland approved.

                        CONSIDERATION OF LIQUOR BILL

                       Bill agreed to without debate.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I request that  Order  No
4 on the Order Paper stand over.

             REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF INTERNATIONAL
                AGREEMENTS ON DOUBLE TAXATION AND TAX EVASION

CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Orders number five to nine  on  the  Order  Paper
are for the request for the approval by Parliament of certain  international
agreements and conventions, in terms of section 231(2) of the  Constitution.
By agreement the orders will be dealt with together and thereafter,  I  will
put each instrument separately.

Ms B A HOGAN: Chairperson, these are agreements that relate  to  our  double
taxation agreements which we have with a number of countries. One  would  be
aware that during the apartheid era, we were not in a position  to  finalise
double taxation agreements with a large number of countries. Since then,  we
have been doing a lot  of  catching  up.  So,  regularly  every  year,  this
committee  and  Parliament  approves  a  whole  number  of  double  taxation
agreements.

They  run  to  a  standard  formula,  which  is  internationally   accepted.
Occasionally, there are one or two changes to  that  formula,  depending  on
the particular characteristics of a particular  agreement  and  our  trading
relations with that country. But, generally, they are very standard  formula
agreements. This year we are placing before this House, the  agreement  with
the Republic of Rwanda, the Republic of Botswana,  the  Sultanate  of  Oman,
the Republic of Belarus, the Federative Republic of  Brazil,  and  then  the
Convention on Temporary Admission for the Istanbul Convention. I  move  that
we approve these agreements. Thank you very much.

Debate concluded.

government of the Republic of Rwanda for the avoidance  of  double  taxation
and the  prevention  of  fiscal  evasion  in  respect  of  taxes  on  income

         REPORTS OF JOINT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS AND MEMBERS' INTERESTS

Mr L T LANDERS: Chairperson, it is my privilege to  present  to  this  House
the findings and recommendations  of  the  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics  and
Members' Interests on its consideration of three complaints received by  the
Registrar of Members' Interests. These are: The complaint  against  the  hon
Deputy President Zuma, the complaint against the hon D A A Olifant  and  the
complaint against the hon Mr M A Maziya.

The committee's reports on each of these matters speak  for  themselves  and
do not require further elucidation by me. However, I do wish to address  you
on one or two issues arising from these enquiries. The first one relates  to
the criticism by certain sections of the media that the joint committee,  in
considering complaints against members, needs to be  transparent.  I  assume
this to  mean  that  the  registrar's  investigations  and  the  committee's
considerations of the reports of those investigations should be thrown  open
to the media and by extension to the public.

Presently, these enquiries take place behind closed  doors  because  in  our
view, both the registrar and the committee  need  that  space  in  which  to
conduct the enquiry and to consider the facts  and  evidence  pertaining  to
such an enquiry. We must be mindful of the  fact  that  as  politicians  and
elected representatives, we easily succumb to the need to grandstand and  to
adopt political positions on most matters. I  have  no  doubt  that  if  the
enquiries of the committee were thrown open, as demanded by  these  critics,
it would be to the detriment  of  us  all  and  certainly  to  that  of  due
process.

We must guard against these enquires being conducted in the  media,  by  the
media and for the media. However, if this criticism  is  aimed  at  my  ham-
handed, amateurish interaction with the media, then I will  readily  concede
my guilt. I assure this House that I will make  every  effort  at  improving
this, provided that in doing so, we do not impinge upon due process.

The second  issue  I  wish  to  raise  relates  to  the  procedure  for  the
investigation of complaints and, in particular, the  provision  relating  to
the holding of hearings. The rule states as follows, and I quote:


  Hearings must be held when the facts are in dispute.  The  committee  may
  decide to call a  hearing  if  the  investigation  by  the  registrar  is
  inconclusive or if the registrar is unable to make a recommendation or if
  the committee decides that a hearing should be held.

In the matter of the complaint against Deputy President Zuma, the  committee
decided that a hearing should not be held. The committee took this  decision
for the following reason: It accepted the registrar's finding that the  case
against the hon  Deputy  President  should  be  dismissed.  The  registrar's
findings were conclusive. The facts were not in dispute.

The committee reached the conclusion that the facts  were  not  in  dispute,
based on information that the registrar had obtained the previous  day  from
the National Prosecuting Authority and from one of the witnesses,  Ms  Norah
Fakude-Nkuna; information which until then had been kept from the  committee
for whatever reason. What was this information?

Firstly, that Ms Fakude-Nkuna is  a  business  partner  of  the  hon  Deputy
President's nephew, Mr Ray Zuma. This fact  explains  the  relationship  and
puts into clear perspective the financial arrangements between  herself  and
Mr Ray Zuma.

Secondly, the NPA admitted that they had not taken sworn affidavits from  Ms
Fakude-Nkuna, but, instead, had conducted  extensive  interviews  with  her.
Morever, the National Prosecuting Authority had not taped these  interviews,
nor did they have transcripts  of  these  interviews  with  Ms  Fakude-Nkuna
because they had been lost. Indeed, the  investigator  who  conducted  these
interviews  had  since  left  the  service  of  the   National   Prosecuting
Authority.

Given these facts, the committee could come to no other conclusion  than  to
accept and uphold the recommendation by the registrar, which  was  that  the
Deputy President did not have  a  case  to  answer.  I  wish  to  take  this
opportunity to correct one or two things. The  report  does  not  make  this
particular matter clear. In my interaction with the media, again in my  ham-
handed way, I might have overlooked this or given the wrong impression.

In the complaint against the hon Mr Maziya, an amount of R70 000  was  added
to a list of other figures which he allegedly received. Now  the  amount  of
R70 000 is the subject of abitration between  Mr  Maziya  and  his  business
partners. Therefore, the amount of R70 000 does not form part of our  report
and the finding of the joint committee. So what is it that we have found  Mr
Maziya guilty of? We found him guilty of having received the following  sums
of money: R30 000 in cash, a cheque for R5 000, a cheque for  R2  500,  cash
of R2 500, another cheque for R5 000, cash of R2 000, cash of R4 000. In  my
very humble mathematics, that comes to a total of R51 000.

These are sums of money that the hon Mr Maziya did not declare and which  he
has since admitted to. On a lighter note, while dealing with Mr  Maziya,  at
the meeting of 19 November, the committee was  privileged  to  have  in  its
midst, joining us for the first time, the hon Mr Lever -  a  member  of  the
NCOP. We welcomed Mr Lever and we are sure that  he  will  make  a  valuable
contribution to the committee.

I make this point because it took us less than half an  hour  to  deal  with
this matter on 19 November. In that half an hour, I want to put it  to  you,
the hon Mr Lever could not have applied his mind to the matters  before  us,
particularly with regard to the hon Deputy President. However,  the  hon  Mr
Lever exercised his right to vote against the  registrar's  recommendations,
despite not having applied his mind to the matter.

When we had concluded the matter of the Deputy President, we then  moved  on
to deal with the matter of the complaint against the hon Mr Maziya.  Members
of the DA had left by then. One of the people who  had  also  voted  against
the registrar's recommendation, was the hon Mr Aucamp. When it  got  to  the
matter of Mr Maziya, Mr Aucamp  then  adopted  a  very  noble  position  and
wanted it placed on record that he had not applied his mind  to  the  matter
of  the  complaint  against  the  hon  Mr  Maziya,  and  therefore  he   was
abstaining. Yet, he had applied his mind in the time span of less than  half
an hour to the matter pertaining to the hon Deputy President.
I raise this point merely to make hon members a little aware  of  what  took
place in the committee. We  are  confident  of  what  is  contained  in  the
reports  before  this  House  and  we  accordingly  commend  them  to   you.
[Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move:


  That the reports be adopted.

Declarations of vote:

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Mr Chair, the purpose of the code of conduct in the  ethics
laws is to prevent unethical  conduct  by  imposing  regulations  which  are
implemented to prevent infractions rather than to  punish  offenders.  In  a
report  recently  compiled  by  the  Political  Information  and  Monitoring
Service - South Africa, titled: ``Government Ethics in  Postapartheid  South
Africa'', it has  been  stated  that  the  principles  of  ethics  laws  are
prevention, simplicity, relevance and protection.

It is ironic that Idasa's political information and  monitoring  service  is
today holding a one  day  seminar  on  this  very  relevant  topic,  namely,
debating ethics in postapartheid South Africa, as we speak.

The DA concurs with the reports of the Ethics Committee on  Mr  A  M  Maziya
and Mr D A A Olifant. With regard to Mr Olifant, we would like to note  that
although Mr Olifant's explanation was  found  to  be  acceptable,  his  name
appearing on an advertising brochure, indicating him as a  director  of  the
business, without his in fact being so, indicates the extent to  which  care
and caution have to be displayed by members in conducting their affairs.

The DA, however, strongly rejects the majority view of the Ethics  Committee
that the hon Deputy President Zuma be cleared of all charges with regard  to
the alleged nondeclaration of benefits. The loans and  financial  agreements
constitute substantial benefits which  in  our  view  the  Deputy  President
failed to declare. He is, therefore, in contravention of  the  Parliamentary
Code of Ethics - according to us.

The documents with which the committee dealt, reflected a most  unusual  set
of circumstances, and I think it was at some point in time  a  common  point
of departure that they were  an  unusual  set  of  financial  circumstances,
which raised serious questions of  credibility.  There  were,  for  example,
serious contradictions which called for further investigation.

The minority view was that it was essential for the affected parties  to  be
required  to  give  evidence  before  the   committee   to   explain   these
contradictions. This was rejected by the majority, led  by  the  ANC  ruling
party. Various disputes of facts arose in respect of  the  allegations.  The
code is clear on what should happen when disputes arise, viz, that  hearings
must be held. To deny this basic requirement, as happened, is to render  the
code and the committee redundant.

The Ethics Committee, by claiming to clear  the  hon  Deputy  President,  Mr
Zuma, when so many questions remain unanswered,  has  shown  little  concern
for the  ethical  standards  which  the  public  expects  of  their  elected
representatives. The political bias  shown  by  individual  members  of  the
committee, especially the ANC,  when  they  ought  to  remain  neutral,  was
shocking.  Statements  by  individual  members  that  the  purpose  of   the
committee is to protect members,  is  clearly  not  true.  Members  have  to
function independently and with fairness in coming to a fair and  considered
decision, whether it be guilty or not guilty or  contravening  the  Code  of
Ethics.

It was furthermore clear that whatever the issues were to be in  respect  of
the  hon  Deputy  President,  Mr  Jacob  Zuma,  however  incriminating   the
evidence, the individual ANC members  of  the  committee  had  predetermined
their decision, quite clearly: total exoneration.  This  proved  true,  when
during committee session, decisions were taken without me  being  given  the
opportunity to state my view. Decisions had to be, or were purported to  be,
rescinded at one stage in respect of whether or not  Mr  Zuma  had  breached
the Code of Ethics. In the light thereof, and in particular in the light  of
the bias displayed by ANC members of the committee, we cannot agree  to  the
committee's report on the hon Deputy President. [Applause.]

Mrs  S  A  SEATON:  Chairperson,  I  do  not  have  very  much   time.   So,
unfortunately, I cannot deal with it to the extent that others are going  to
or have dealt with this matter. I just wanted to place on  record,  firstly,
that I believe that I have shown over the past 10 years in  this  Parliament
that I have tried to be unbiased and principled on issues that I deal with.

I cannot agree with the chairperson of this committee that this  report  was
acceptable to all. Dealing with the report on the Deputy President,  let  me
state at the outset: I  do  not  support  the  report,  and  I  specifically
requested that my objection be recorded against that  report  on  the  basis
that incorrect  and  unsatisfactory  procedure  had  been  followed  in  the
matter.

There were facts in dispute and there should, therefore, have been  hearings
held in terms of clause 3.1  of  the  procedure  for  the  investigation  of
complaints. It is said  that  where  there  are  disputes,  there  shall  be
hearings. There were disputes. The fact that a section of the committee  was
opposed, indicates that there were disputes.

In addition, on numerous occasions  during  the  deliberations,  there  were
accusations from members of the majority party that opposition  parties  had
come together and taken a decision to adopt a particular stand.  I  had  not
even discussed this within my own party, how could I have discussed it  with
opposition parties?

I took points of order on several occasions, and sadly  the  chairman  chose
not to deal with the issue. He even  allowed  a  member  who  had  not  been
present at the time I put my proposal to vote against me. He proceeded  with
a full disciplinary hearing while the person was  not  present.  She  walked
in, hearing that my proposal was being discussed - those  four  had  already
been  done  -  she  put  her  hand  up,  and  was  allowed  to   proceed   -
notwithstanding the fact that she was not even in the room at the time.

The sad thing is that as far as this matter is concerned,  in  my  heart,  I
will never know if the Deputy President was guilty or  not  guilty,  because
the matters have not been fully placed before us.

With regard to the matter of Mr Maziya, I  concur  with  the  decision  with
regard to his conduct. However,  again,  I  cannot  accept  the  report  for
procedural reasons. Procedures were not followed. So, I reject that report.

On the matter of Mr Daniel Olifant, I  wholeheartedly  support  the  report.
Notwithstanding that, the points made by Mr Schmidt are  very  clear,  there
are problems. Members have to take cognisance of what they do and  how  they
operate their business matters, and ensure that Parliament  is  always  seen
in a good light. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Chair, the ruling  by  the  Ethics  Committee,  made  up  of  a
majority of ANC and New NP members is, in my  opinion,  premature,  as  this
investigation  cannot  be  concluded  when  evidence  before  the  committee
contains contradictions which have not been adequately explained.

It is my opinion, and that of  the  ACDP,  that  key  role-players  and  the
Public Prosecutor should have been asked to give oral  evidence  before  the
committee before any conclusions were drawn. Even then, this finding  should
merely have been an interim one, pending the  outcome  of  the  Shaik  court
proceedings which are inextricably linked to the  issues  discussed  by  the
Ethics Committee.

The strong likelihood that evidence will emerge  during  this  trial,  which
will impact on the Ethics Committee findings, has  been  ignored.  The  ACDP
disagrees with the Ethics Committee's opinion that the question  of  whether
or not the loan agreement compromised or impaired the judgment  of  the  hon
Deputy President Jacob Zuma is not relevant.

The purpose of disclosure to  Parliament  is  to  guard  against  situations
where office-bearers abuse or compromise their positions, and this  question
is  surely,  therefore,  relevant.  The  committee  has  set   a   dangerous
precedent, as anyone who has been found to have received money  can  produce
loan agreements after the fact to support nondisclosure of funds.

It  appears  that  Ministers  are  clearly  off-limits,  and  this  prevents
Parliament  from  performing  any  real  oversight  function.   Members   of
Parliament are strictly dealt with and punished, while in matters  involving
the executive, Parliament treads lightly and MPs apparently feel obliged  to
defend their leaders.

The Ethics Committee is, therefore, not a suitable structure  to  deal  with
allegations  against  any  executive  member  of  the  Government,  and   an
independent  inquiry  should  have  been  set  up   to   investigate   these
allegations. Findings in respect of Mr Maziya and Mr Olifant  are  supported
by the ACDP.

Mr J P CRONIN: Chairperson, I think the first thing to bear in  mind  is  to
understand what the Ethics Committee is  all  about.  I  think  there  is  a
tendency to understand the Ethics Committee as Atlas holding  up  the  whole
burden of ethics in South Africa. It is one component of a broad panoply  of
institutions and structures that this ANC-majority  Government  has  brought
into being in South Africa: the Public Protector, ethics committees  -  both
at national and provincial level. There is the independent media,  which  is
a whole lot more independent than it was before. There is robust  opposition
from political parties. All of those are components of upholding  ethics  in
public life in our country. I think that is the first point.

For instance the ACDP  speaker  just  said  that  the  Ethics  Committee  is
inappropriate to look at executive members. The Ethics Committee has  looked
at executive members, including, for  instance,  recently  the  Minister  of
Defence.  The  Minister  of  Defence  co-operated  fully  with  the   Ethics
Committee. We came to a  certain  finding.  However,  there  are  additional
requirements on executive members,  which  is  why  there  is  an  executive
members' code of conduct and  a  Public  Protector,  who  looked  into  this
matter by the way, and into the matter of the Deputy President.

So I think it is very  important  to  understand  the  role  of  the  Ethics
Committee. We are not holding up the whole burden of ethics in South  Africa
and if we fail to punish or  introduce  capital  punishment  for  offenders,
somehow, ethics is going to crumble in South Africa.

A second  key  point,  is  that  this  Ethics  Committee  with  its  limited
resources, with its perhaps limited powers and so on  has  done  an  amazing
amount of work. The Chief Whip of the Majority Party has been involved  with
this Ethics Committee. A  Defence  Minister  has  been  involved.  A  former
president of the ANC Women's League was involved and now we have dealt  with
the Deputy President and that  Deputy  President  and  his  office  has  co-
operated fully with this Ethics Committee. So it is  not  some  limp-wristed
entity incapable of addressing the challenges in front of us.
Let me address the key issue which is coming up a great deal.  According  to
members of the opposition, there is a dispute in terms of the  facts  before
us regarding the issue of the Deputy President. As far as we  are  concerned
there is no dispute and there was no evidence countering it.  What  we  have
is  hearsay  allegations  from  the  Scorpions   saying   that,   in   their
investigation,  certain  things  have  been  said.   We   asked   them   for
documentation, for the sworn statements that  they  have  taken  from  these
members of the public. They said to us that  they  had  actually  not  taken
sworn statements.  They  had,  in  fact,  lost  the  documentation  and  the
official involved in that investigation had since left the Scorpions.

Up against that we have five sworn statements, five affidavits in  front  of
us  from  the  two  individuals  involved  in   that   particular   set   of
circumstances. There is no dispute, nor contrary information.  If  there  is
further information that will emerge later on, at some future  date,  so  be
it, and we, as the Ethics Committee, may or may not  have  to  address  that
matter,  should  it  arise.  But  to  suggest  that  there  was  some   huge
contradiction and that we just chose to sweep that contradiction  under  the
carpet is absolutely and completely wrong. It is simply without any  factual
basis.

These committee reports have the full support of  the  ANC,  especially  the
recommendations of the committee in respect of all three matters, not  least
that in regard to the Deputy President. There is an allegation that we  came
in as the ANC, with a predetermined agenda  to  find  the  Deputy  President
innocent. The predetermined agenda  was  the  headline  in  newspapers.  One
newspaper had to apologise twice over for a  headline  in  which  the  facts
were manipulated in order to suggest that  this  had  happened.  Twice  over
that newspaper had to back down: Headline on the front  page  the  one  day;
the next day, a tiny little microscopic apology on page two.

You think we came in with a predetermined agenda but we can  equally  allege
that members of the opposition came in with  another  predetermined  agenda.
Firstly, to find the Deputy President  guilty  at  all  costs  and,  failing
that, at least to prolong this matter until April next year.  We  completely
reject what the minority of the members of the committee have suggested.  We
feel that we have done  justice  to  the  matters  in  front  of  us.  [Time
expired.]

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, I think that it is very  important  to  understand
the scope and role of the Ethics Committee. The hon Cronin referred  to  it.
We are neither a court of law, nor are we  an  investigating  authority.  We
need to assess whether or not the member has breached the code of conduct.

In terms of that, the New National Party agrees to  the  recommendations  of
the committee. Today should have been a celebration for this Parliament,  it
should have been the celebration of a democracy that is 10 years old.  Where
in the world would you find a democracy where three of the  members  of  the
ruling party with a two-third majority, are charged?

We looked at this with  the  ruling  party,  with  opposition  parties  very
carefully, very thoroughly. One member was reprimanded, another  member  was
cautioned. When we looked at the Deputy President, what was the  essence  of
his case at the end of the day? He  had  received  loans.  We  had  letters,
statements from both parties, that all  three  loans  were  interest-bearing
loans. What was there to moan and shout about?

How can we  celebrate  today  that  we  are  a  fair  democracy?  When  this
Parliament sits as a jury of our peers, we look at  each  other  justly  and
very fairly. If that has not happened, do we want to destroy  the  lives  of
three people for politics?

                              AFTERNOON SITTING
                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT


  Mr N M NENE: Deputy Speaker, it is my singular pleasure to participate in
  today's debate on the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  that  was
  tabled by the Minister of Finance  on  12  November  this  year.  In  the
  foreword to the statement the Minister says and I quote:


  This Statement sets the tone that will guide the  2004  Budget  and  help
  steer our course through a second decade  of  democratic  development  in
  South Africa.

He continues:


  It affirms Government's commitment to supporting growth  and  development
  through higher levels of investment in our people and our infrastructure.

This statement we  are  debating  today  is  the  outcome  of  a  considered
scrutiny that emanates from the  publication  titled,  ``Towards  a  10-year
review'',  which  is  a  frank  and  honest  assessment   of   the   ANC-led
Government's performance over the past nine and a half years.

This  document  measures  our  Government's  performance  against  the  five
objectives  that  were  outlined  in  the  Reconstruction  and   Development
Programme. These objectives are: The meeting of basic  needs,  building  the
economy, democratising the state and  society,  developing  human  resources
and nation-building.

The Reconstruction and Development Programme  was  an  integrated,  coherent
socioeconomic policy framework. It sought to mobilise  all  our  people  and
our country's resources towards the final eradication of apartheid  and  the
building of a democratic, nonracial and nonsexist society.

The  statement  is  also  built  on  the  solid  foundation  of  growth  and
development summit commitments. Census 2001 was also an important  yardstick
to refocus the Government on policy  priorities  for  improving  growth  and
broadening participation in the economy.
The document, ``Towards a  10-year  review'',  which  I  have  referred  to,
tracks the challenges faced by this country  since  the  attainment  of  our
democracy. The challenges identified relate to institutional  transformation
and  the  introduction  of  new  policies  in  line  with   the   democratic
Constitution.

The ANC Government was also confronted with the legacy of apartheid,  whilst
at the same time facing new challenges  of  integrating  the  country  in  a
rapidly changing global environment. It is in response to  these  challenges
that the ANC Government is pursuing an expansionary  fiscal  framework  that
aims  to  support  growth  in  both  the  medium  and  long-term,   increase
Government spending on social services and infrastructure development  needs
in the medium-term, while  also  contributing  towards  human  and  physical
capital formation required for long-term sustainable growth.

The policy priorities for the 2004 Budget, which I will speak  about  later,
seek to reduce dependence on social welfare  by  increasing  the  number  of
people  that  rely  on  normal  participation  in  the  economy  for   their
livelihood. The  Joint  Budget  Committee,  as  mandated  by  our  terms  of
reference, held hearings on the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement from  14
to  20  November  this  year,  with  a  number  of  Government  departments,
business, labour and civil society organisations making submissions  to  the
committee.

The  departments  that  appeared  before  the   committee   demonstrated   a
relatively high level of readiness to meet the obligations of the MTEF  with
the limited resources that are available to them. The committee also took  a
dramatic approach in its hearings with the following themes: Firstly,  rural
development and urban renewal, which one of my colleagues will  be  speaking
about; secondly, economic growth and employment;  thirdly,  social  security
and health; fourthly, justice  and  protection;  and  lastly,  international
relations. My other colleagues will be speaking about rural development  and
urban renewal and also social security and health.

Allow me to say a few words on economic growth and  employment  as  well  as
international relations. Under this theme the  committee  heard  submissions
from eight national departments, categorised into  two  type:  Firstly,  the
implementing  departments,  which  were   Public   Works,   Water   Affairs,
Agriculture and Transport;  and,  secondly,  regulating  departments,  which
were Trade and Industry, Environmental Affairs and Tourism and Labour.

These departments were invited to make presentations because  of  their  key
roles  in  implementing  Government's  development  policy,  including   job
creation  and  black  economic  empowerment,  in  a   stable   microeconomic
environment. Except for a  few  concerns  expressed  by  the  committee  and
reflected  in  the  report,  the  departments  are  well-prepared  for   the
challenges ahead.  Portfolio  committees  are  also  urged  to  monitor  the
performance of these departments in their oversight.

Under the theme of international  relations,  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence
made submissions to the committee, the central element of  which  was  South
Africa's role in the continent and abroad.  The  country's  achievements  in
this regard are tremendous and we have every reason to celebrate  and  share
our experiences more particularly with the continent.

According  to  this  statement,  overall  spending  on  policy   priorities,
including  social   and   economic   infrastructure,   human   capital   and
administrative services will grow by an  annual  average  of  4,4%  in  real
terms over the MTEF period. According to the statement,  this  will  sustain
the growth of infrastructure and  capital  spending  established  since  the
2001 Budget.

The Joint Budget Committee agrees that the underlying  processes  have  been
improved tremendously to ensure better outputs  and  outcomes.  However,  we
have conceded that  the  link  between  strategic  planning,  budgeting  and
reporting  needs  to  be  further  strengthened.  National  and   provincial
departments are now basing their spending  plans  on  strategic  plans  that
have been informed by sound policies and reporting formats are improving.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please  can  we  lower  our  voices.
Remember the attendance  is  very  good  so  we  might  think  that  we  are
whispering but then we end up really doing more than that.

Mr N  M  NENE:  These  policies  are  entrenching  accountability  and  good
governance. This is an integral part of the Public Finance Management Act.

The key spending priorities as outlined in the  statement  are  as  follows:
Renewed focus on employment creation  through  the  expanding  Public  Works
programme  -  which  my  colleagues  will  be  speaking   about;   increased
infrastructure spending; scaling up of the  Aids  treatment  programme;  the
extension of social grants through the child support grant and other  grants
targeting vulnerable groups; the provision of learner support  material  for
schools; the continued roll-out of free basic  services  and  investment  in
municipal infrastructure;  strengthening  the  safety  and  security  sector
through the sector policing structure strategy  and  a  new  protection  and
security services division  that  has  been  established,  while  the  child
justice centres have also been taken care of; improving  core  Home  Affairs
services to citizens, including a roll-out to rural areas; the promotion  of
peace in the continent and regional trade  and  development;  and  promoting
broad-based black economic empowerment, which is a new budgetary priority.

These priorities are confirmation of  a  continued  commitment  by  the  ANC
Government to better the  lives  of  all  South  Africans  and  restore  the
dignity  of  South  Africans  and  Africans  at  large.  Let  me  take  this
opportunity to invite members to read the committee's report  in  the  ATC's
of 24 November. The ANC supports this statement.

Dr P J RABIE: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  hon  Minister  and  hon  members,  the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement is in essence a pre-election statement.

The DA  welcomes  the  announcement  in  the  MTBPS  that  the  tax  amnesty
deadline, regarding exchange  control,  will  be  extended  to  the  end  of
February 2004. The fact that the deadline falls on the same date as the  end
of the tax year  will  enable  South  Africans  to  repatriate  much  needed
offshore funds back into South Africa.

What is of concern, however, is that the absence of another tax overrun  may
result in limited tax relief for the middle and  lower  income  groups.  The
hon Minister mentioned that the revenue shortfall is  expected  to  be  some
R4,6 billion due to the strength ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please lower your voices.

Dr P J RABIE: ... of the rand and the decline in exports, especially in  the
manufacturing sector.

The DA is the  official  opposition  -  we  play  a  constructive  role,  we
criticise when necessary, and we will give credit to the Government when  it
is due. The excellent reduction in  the  budget  deficit,  public  debt  and
better tax collection is noteworthy, but of  concern  is  the  fact  that  a
number of state, provincial and  municipal  budgets  are  still  underspent.
This is clearly not acceptable.

It is estimated that more than one  million  jobs  were  lost  in  the  past
decade, forcing millions of  middle  and  lower  income  South  Africans  to
adjust their personal budgets. The cost of security, transport  toll  roads,
education and other expenses have escalated dramatically in  the  past  year
which has made it extremely difficult for  millions  of  South  Africans  to
make ends meet.

The announcement by the hon Minister that taxation on  retirement  funds  is
to be reduced from 25% to 18%, in his  Budget  Speech  this  year,  is  very
significant.

Die DA versoek dat hierdie belasting tot  minder  as  10%  in  die  volgende
belastingjaar  verminder  word.  Die  huidige  stelsel  van   belasting   op
pensioenfondse is 'n  vorm  van  dubbele  belasting.  Etlike  pensioenfondse
bevind  hulle  vandag  in  'n  finansiële  oorlewingstryd.  Die  DA   beskou
pensioenfondse en ander welsynsinstansies as 'n bate  wat  die  maatskaplike
las en verpligting  van  die  staat  verminder.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[The DA requests that this tax be reduced to less than 10% in the  next  tax
year. The current system of tax  on  pension  funds  is  a  form  of  double
taxation. Several pension funds at present find themselves  in  a  financial
battle for  survival.  The  DA  regards  pension  funds  and  other  welfare
organisations  as  an  asset  which  decreases   the   social   burden   and
responsibility that rests on the state.]

Due  to  the  incidence  of  HIV/Aids,  South  Africa  may  experience  zero
population growth by 2011. The South African population is  ageing,  and  we
are experiencing an alarming exodus of highly  skilled  predominantly  young
people. Time is of the essence, and the DA urges  the  Minister  to  request
the task team, which has been set up, to investigate taxation on  retirement
funds, to finalise their report in order to alleviate  the  plight  of  some
members of pension funds.

The following forecasts  of  Treasury  are  noteworthy.  Growth  in  GDP  is
estimated at 2,2% for 2003; 3,3% for 2004  and  3,5%  for  2005.  Our  CPIX,
metro and urban, is projected at 6,9% for 2003, 4,9% for 2004 and  5,4%  for
2005. This is well within our inflation target  band  and  should  encourage
investor and consumer confidence.

The continued global economic downturn, coupled  with  a  relatively  strong
rand, resulted in the Treasury adjusting the estimated growth from  3,3%  to
2,2%. A positive development is that South  Africa's  foreign  reserves  had
increased. By the end of September 2003, gross  gold  and  foreign  reserves
had risen to US$20,2 billion - up almost 30% from March 2003.

The fact that the Net Open Forward Position was eliminated by 2003  is  also
significant, and the Net Open Forward Position strengthening to  a  positive
US$1,8 billion  at  the  end  of  September  may  also  be  a  factor  which
contributed to the strengthening of the rand.

Policy measures announced, and given effect in the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment
Act of 2003, relate to incentives for urban renewal, reduction  in  the  tax
on  retirement  funds,  allowances  to  encourage  business  investment  and
adjustments to foreign business taxation.

The key spending priorities for the 2004 Budget are: A focus  on  employment
creation  through   the   Expanded   Public   Works   Programme;   increased
infrastructure spending;  and  R12  billion  apportioned  for  HIV/Aids  and
antiretroviral rollout over four years.

Another priority is the extension of  social  security  grants  through  the
child support grant and other grants, targeting  school  textbooks  for  the
poor; further assistance in respect of free basic  services  and  investment
in municipal infrastructure; further assistance to the safety  and  security
sector; improving core Home Affairs  services  to  citizens  -  there  is  a
particular need in rural areas for ID documents, etc; and  promoting  broad-
based black empowerment.

Adjunkspeaker, die DA het besondere waardering vir al die lede van die Suid-
Afrikaanse Weermag en vir wat hulle op  grondvlak  -  in  Suid-Afrika  doen.
Verder is dit gebiedend noodsaaklik dat die Weermag  toegerus  word  om  ons
marienebronne en grense te  beskerm.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Deputy Speaker, the DA has special appreciation for all the members of  the
SA Defence Force and for what they are doing at grass-roots level  in  South
Africa. Furthermore, it is of the utmost importance that the  Defence  Force
is equipped to protect our marine resources and our borders.]

In the adjusted estimate, an unforeseeable and  unavoidable  expenditure  of
R500 million for Defence is mentioned. South Africa has committed the  SANDF
to a number of peace support operations in Africa. There  are  currently  10
members deployed in Ethiopia, 4 in Eritrea, 1 418 in the DRC and  a  further
1 512 in Burundi. The troops stationed in Burundi differ from  other  United
Nations deployments in as far as they are a part of the African  Mission  in
Burundi. South Africa thus has to pay for its own troops in Burundi.

The initial deployment in Burundi was responsible for  VIP  protection.  The
current mission, however, has been extended to include  the  supervision  of
two demobilisation centres.  According  to  figures  handed  to  me  by  the
spokesperson for Defence of the DA, the  expected  cost  of  our  troops  in
Burundi will be about R679 million in 2003. It could  cost  a  further  R564
million in 2004, R577 million in 2005, and R600 million in 2006.  There  are
no timeframes in Burundi, and South Africa has, therefore,  become  involved
in an open-ended process with no apparent exit criteria in place.

Besides the astronomical costs and the apparent lack of exit criteria,  huge
logistical problems exist due to  long  distances,  the  lack  of  political
planning and  risk  assessment.  Troops  on  the  ground  endure  inadequate
accommodation  and  medical  facilities.  It  is  reported  that   the   low
serviceability of vehicles has also become a constraint.

Die bekende nyweraar en sakeman, Dr Anton Rupert, het by geleentheid  gemeld
dat indien jou buurman honger is, is dit moeilik om  rustig  te  slaap.  Ons
buurland noord van die Limpopo, Zimbabwe, staar 'n ernstige  hongersnood  in
die gesig. Daar word bereken dat bykans 60% van 'n bevolking van 11  miljoen
deur 'n voedseltekort bedreig word. Die inflasiekoers in  Zimbabwe  is  tans
in die orde van 400%.

Daar vind tans ernstige skending van basiese menseregte plaas.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The well-known industrialist and businessman, Dr Anton  Rupert,  once  said
that if your neighbour is hungry, it is difficult to sleep  peacefully.  Our
neighbouring country, north of the Limpompo, Zimbabwe, is facing  a  serious
famine. It has been calculated  that  nearly  60%  of  a  population  of  11
million is being threatened by  a  food  shortage.  The  inflation  rate  in
Zimbabwe is currently of the order of over 400%.  Serious  infringements  of
basic human rights are currently taking place there.]

Chances are that the entire Zimbabwean economy, or what is left of  it,  may
implode in the foreseeable future. Charity begins at home. It  is  important
that we take proactive steps to guard  our  borders.  South  Africa  has  an
important role to play in Africa. The role,  however,  must  be  weighed  up
against domestic needs. All  indications  are  that  at  present  the  South
African Defence Force has overstretched  its  capacity  in  terms  of  peace
support.

The substantial additional allocation of R1,9 billion to  HIV  and  Aids  is
welcomed  but  long  overdue,  and  is  a  victory   for   democracy.   This
announcement is good news for  five  million  South  Africans  who  are  HIV
positive. Thousands of doctors and medical nursing personnel  will  have  to
be trained in order to administer the antiretroviral  drugs  in  the  proper
manner.

Aids is posing an alarming threat  to  the  South  African  society.  Eleven
thousand South Africans, many  of  them  in  their  prime,  die  daily.  The
emotional trauma for their next of kin,  especially  the  children  orphaned
because of Aids, is a human tragedy of grave proportion.

Drie bekende Suid-Afrikaanse ekonome het die Gesamentlike  Begrotingskomitee
toegespreek en 'n aantal aspekte  gemeld  wat  verdere  toeligting  verdien.
Naamlik, eerstens, die herstrukturering van staatsbates is nie voldoende  in
die agbare Minister se voorligting aangespreek  nie.  Tweedens,  klein-  tot
medium  sake-ondernemings  en  volhoubare  werkskepping   vir   die   hande-
aarbeidkomponent van die  arbeidsektor  is  van  sleutelbelang  en  moet  in
detail aangespreek word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Three well-known  South  African  economists  addressed  the  Joint  Budget
Committee  and  mentioned  a  number  of  aspects   that   deserve   further
elucidation. Namely, firstly, the restructuring  of  state  assets  has  not
been adequately addressed in the hon Minister's  briefing.  Secondly,  small
to medium business enterprises and sustainable job creation for  the  manual
component of  the  labour  sector  are  of  vital  importance  and  must  be
addressed in detail.]

Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  DA  supports  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Deputy Speaker, patterns within the budget  numbers  had
become so consistent over recent years that it did come as  something  of  a
surprise to see certain trends suddenly coming to an end in the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement.

These, of course, are not so much on the expenditure side,  where  it  seems
social spending trends and an expansionary tendency  are  being  maintained,
but rather on the financing side. Here, in summary, we  are  presented  with
assumptions from which predictions of slowing tax revenue growth  and  lower
privatisation proceeds are made and in view of which a higher  deficit  will
be run in order to sustain the  expenditure  side.  So  this  constitutes  a
changing arithmetical permutation of the Budget for at  least  a  few  years
ahead.

Now these shifts seem to have excited some interesting analysis and  comment
from relevant public quarters - some of which is worth  musing  over.  There
was that which saw Maggie Manual, or was it  Trevor  Thatcher,  edging  away
from a neo-liberalism and towards some dated social democracy model.  Others
saw the  shifts  as  less  ideologically  inspired  but  more  situationally
demanded.

The Minister's fans, of whom  there  are  many,  claim  that  the  movements
represent the masterful and strategic thinking of a pragmatist.  The  cynics
cut through all this to explain it essentially as an attempt to sustain  and
even boost social and welfare type spending as a  pre-election  tactic.  And
there have been the prophets of doom arguing that, in  response  to  slowing
income, increasing the deficit is an act of desperation which amounts  to  a
gamble which will have serious medium-term  economic  consequences  for  the
country.

Then there is a less dramatic, but  more  conspiratorial  interpretation  of
shifts mentioned earlier, which I have found  myself  pondering  over,  that
concerns the revenue to GDP percentage - which we  know  to  be  a  starting
consideration of potential foreign direct investors, ie those investors  who
we desperately need to come and give impetus to our economic growth.

The Minister, the Governor of the South African Reserve Bank,  the  IMF  and
most emerging  economies  place  serious  effort  on  keeping  the  national
revenue as a percentage of the GDP at below 25%, and the lower  the  better.
We note that our percentage is on the high side, and has been  under  upward
pressure for some years now. So  the  conspiracy  question  is  whether  the
24,8% shown in the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement for  the  next  three
years is more pivotal to the budget arithmetic,  and  indeed  the  increased
deficit, than meets the eye.

Is it possible that, notwithstanding this year's  tax  revenue  performance,
the policy statement is being unduly pessimistic  about  tax  collection  in
order to bring the percentage in question  under  the  25%  mark  -  but  of
course to do that the deficit has to be boosted  in  order  to  provide  the
full financing required by the expenditure levels.

An observation which adds intrigue to this theory is  that,  notwithstanding
the Minister's correct claims that our  income  tax  rates  are  competitive
with most developing countries, the overall tax burden as  depicted  by  the
tax to GDP percentage tells a different story. It  suggests  that  the  many
other taxes, duties, fees and obligations are cautioning investors  in  this
regard, and underneath it all they see a shift towards a  social  democratic
order which is characterised by high levels of social spending  financed  by
correspondingly high levels of taxation.
Moving to the expenditure side which, as indicated  earlier,  showed  little
change other than a modestly increased emphasis  on  poverty,  job  creation
and  Aids  spending,  again  there  has  been  some  interesting   reaction,
especially the analysis which saw  the  growth  of  the  so-called  ``social
wage'' as a direct response to the failure to  achieve  reasonable  economic
growth and job creation. Others, while  acknowledging  the  growing  welfare
spending as a percentage of total  spending,  applaud  the  latest  spending
plans concerning the Public Works programme, skills  development  programmes
and capital spending - all directed towards  renewed  efforts  to  stimulate
job growth.

Forgive us for pointing out that these are simply  the  latest  ideas  in  a
very long list of past ideas introduced in  the  hope  of  raising  economic
growth and creating jobs. It seems that Government continues  to  throw  new
and modified plans at problems which are not  going  away.  I  think  as  an
opposition  party  which  has  supported  many  of  these  plans   and   has
acknowledged their potential, there comes a time when we  must  ask  why  so
many serious problems still exist, notwithstanding the good  plans  we  seem
to introduce.

We offer an  observation.  Firstly,  our  plans,  especially  regarding  the
economy and sustainable job creation, excluding the Public Works  programme,
place too much emphasis on  trying  to  create  conducive  environments  and
nurture inviting conditions and refrain from considered interventions  which
actually kick-start and drive  the  activities  we  are  seeking.  In  other
words, the intervention which will ``make it  happen''  as  opposed  to  the
trickle down that is not really happening.

The same observation of poor problem solving can be seen  right  across  the
Government.  The  ability  to  put  together  good  and  creative  plans  is
constantly negated by the inability to make these plans work and  to  demand
a reasonable return for the money and effort invested  in  these  plans.  If
you glance back to the national  departments'  budgets  and  annual  reports
over the past number of years you might be surprised to see  how  many  good
plans with important intentions have just never delivered.  Again  it  seems
to be about the inability to go beyond policy  contained  plans  and  ideas,
and to make those ideas realise what they should.  If  even  half  of  those
plans  had  been  successful,  economic  growth,  job  creation,   education
standards, skills development, crime prevention, etc would  have  progressed
considerably further than they have.

So it tells us that for the promise of successive budgets and  their  policy
parameters to be more than just the  latest  Government  plan  pursuing  the
same  old  problems,  there  has  to  be  greater  commitment,  ability  and
accountability for results. [Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Deputy Speaker,  managing  an  economy  always  involves
balancing contradictions and, indeed, this  Budget  demonstrates  remarkably
how well this Government has been managing contradictions which  are  always
inherent in economic policy.

On the one hand, we are faced with a world economy that is on  the  decline.
That has  had  an  impact.  Our  manufacturing  exporting  sector  has  been
impacted on, and that in turn has affected growth and we  have  revised  our
figures  downward.  Remarkably,  we  still  maintain  a  resilient   growth,
regardless of the downturn,  and  our  growth  still  exceeds  many  of  our
trading partners.

So, that is one side of the equation. The other  side  of  the  equation  is
that, because the rand  has  been  affected  by  the  slowdown  in  economic
growth, that in turn has had an effect on  our  being  able  to  bring  down
interest  rates,  and  that  in  turn  has  had  an  effect  on  stimulating
investment production.

So, whilst  our  manufacturing  export  sector  has  been  affected  by  the
worldwide global  slowdown,  our  domestic  manufacturing  sector  has  been
stimulated and we have seen it, in the last six months or so, at  8%  growth
of investment. That too has been  assisted  by  Government's  investment  in
infrastructure  and,  particularly,  by  the   public   corporations'   very
vigourous investment policies.

Contrary to what my DA  colleague  said,  there  has  been  substantial  tax
relief given to  poor  and  middle-income  groups.  Government's  policy  of
reducing and giving  tax  relief  has  eased  the  costs  of  an  increasing
interest rate in the last year and  the  previous  year,  and  has  managed,
thereby, to maintain consumer spending at a robust level.

So, whilst we have the negatives of a downturn and how that's impacted on  a
sector of our economy, we have  the  positives  of  Government-led  economic
investment fiscal growth managing to counterbalance those negatives.

What I would like to put to you is that, if we are looking at South  Africa,
not as a developed economy and not  as  a  less  developed  one,  but  as  a
developing economy, this judicious balancing of the good with  the  bad  and
forging a way even between the good and the bad  is  what  is  going  to  be
required of us in the years to come.

When I hear opposition  colleagues  saying  that  this  isn't  fast  enough,
unemployment hasn't been dealt with quickly enough and that there are  still
substantial problems in our society, I say to myself that  we  are  only  10
years down the line. We do not have, as European  countries  had  after  the
Second World War, a huge  Marshall  Plan  to  deliver  us  out  of  economic
recession.

We have what we have at our disposal, and that is resources, yes, to  attack
poverty. We are not  a  country  that  does  not  have  resources.  We  have
considerable resources to attack poverty and we  are  using  them,  I  would
say, in a very judicious and balanced way.

It is seen that we have, in an accumulating way, been able  to  improve  the
housing stock of our people. We've seen it in the way that  water  has  been
delivered. We've seen it in the way that  more  and  more  matriculants  are
coming through the matriculation schooling systems successfully,  and  we've
seen it in the roll-out of electricity.

We are talking about steady and accumulative growth that is  sustainable  in
the future. Yes, there are those amongst us who would  have  said,  when  we
came into Government in 1994, let  us  invest,  let  us  spend  and  let  us
ratchet-up the budget deficit because we have to deliver.

We said no, that is going to be unsustainable in the long term. Let us  look
at the sustainability question first, and then see  how  we  can,  within  a
sustainability framework, start to develop even more.

The fact that even in downturn  and  economic  recession,  we  are  able  to
deliver R37 billion more  over  a  three-year  period  than  was  originally
anticipated, because we have brought the costs of debt down and  because  we
are able to spend more, shows the judicious path between  reckless  spending
in order to get short-term rewards and a more  judicious  path  of  reducing
debt and looking at other mechanisms  for  the  way  in  which  we  can  get
sustainable growth.

I would suggest that other countries such as ourselves,  countries  such  as
Brazil and India, are increasingly starting  to  look  at  a  steady  growth
rather than volatile growth and volatile policy interventions that can  have
detrimental effects in the  long  term.  I  would  suspect  that,  in  South
Africa, we are beginning to see a large range of very creative options.

I take, for instance, the  social  welfare  grant.  We  are  aware,  in  the
developed world, that pension  pay-outs  and  the  cost  of  carrying  those
pensions are crippling many economies. Just look at the state of Germany.

We are, I think, the only developing country in the world  that  provides  a
social grant. It's a social welfare net. It has been  proved  by  the  World
Bank to be one of the most effective poverty relief programmes. It is not  a
great amount of money, but it does keep hunger from the door.

That is what I mean when I talk about a road of  judicious  steadiness.  So,
we cannot provide a full  social  welfare  net,  but  we  can  look  at  the
essentials of that welfare net. We can look at ways in which  we  can  start
improving the conditions of our people within the  resources  that  we  have
available, in a sustainable way.

I think this has been the remarkable achievement of this Government and  its
management of the economy. Let me say  that  few  countries,  faced  with  a
worldwide  economic  downturn,  faced  with  revising  their   GDP   figures
downwards and, in the same instance, faced with declining  revenue  figures,
have been able to increase spending at the same  time  merely  because  they
have been able to bring their  debt  costs  down.  It's  been  a  remarkable
fiscal achievement, and it's indicative of the creative  and  judicious  way
in which we have been managing our economy.

I believe that in the next five  years,  now  that  we  are  maturing  as  a
government and now that we have experienced civil servants  and  experienced
policy-makers, we will start to see a maturing of  a  kind  of  creativeness
which our country is well-known for.

I believe that in the interventions around the Public Works programmes,  for
instance, much as one recognises that there  are  short-term  interventions,
we will start to see creative partnerships with the  private  sector  around
Public Works programmes that will be far more sustainable than just a  three
to six months duration.

We saw that with the Working for Water Programme that started off simply  as
a  job  creation  programme.  That  is  no  longer  simply  a  job  creation
programme. Its benefits are  being  recognised  and  the  spending  on  that
programme has been integrated into the mainline Budget. That programme  will
go on.

Similarly, when you look at our tax laws and the  interventions  around  the
urban development zones, that is not just going to be a once-off  or  three-
year programme, but is going to be an ongoing programme to rehabilitate  the
inner cities, and I could go on.

However, what I would like to say is that, as an ANC member,  I'm  proud  to
support this last Budget of this present session of Parliament, and I  would
like to congratulate all concerned for the judicious, creative  and  skilful
way in which they have managed our economy and enabled us as  a  society  to
withstand the ravages of a negative downturn in the  global  economy.  Thank
you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Dr W A ODENDAAL:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  underperformance  of  small,
medium and  micro  enterprises  with  regard  to  economic  growth  and  job
creation in South Africa, compared to other developing countries, has to  be
blamed on the red tape of an overregulated labour  environment  forced  upon
the informal sector by big business and organised labour.

The determination,  however,  of  Government  and  the  private  sector,  in
partnership, to stimulate the role of  small  business  in  the  economy  is
demonstrated by the  decisions  taken  during  the  Growth  and  Development
Summit, the resolutions incorporated into the Financial Sector  Charter  and
the goals set for the Expanded Public Works Programme.

A major portion of this  medium-term  Budget  is  dedicated  to  accelerated
growth in the small business sector.  The  New  NP  supports  the  drive  to
strengthen small business and wishes to propose a  plan  to  intensify  this
acceleration process. The concept is to strive towards full  employment.  We
suggest that Government consider  an  employment  grant  that  would  enable
emerging entrepreneurs to employ more and more people from the ranks of  the
unemployed. Everybody in South Africa must work.

The production factors in business are management, capital and labour.  Only
the  employed  are  recognised  as  part  of  the  economic  structure.  The
unemployed looking for work are perceived as outcasts.  We  need  to  change
this and accept the unemployed as the potential workforce of the future  and
part of the economic goal. We should start treating them  with  dignity  and
the respect they deserve.
The mechanics of the Jobs-For-All Programme  is  to  establish  and  run  an
employment fund in partnership between Government and  the  private  sector.
Grants from this  fund  will  be  allocated  to  emerging  entrepreneurs  to
encourage and enable them to employ as many registered unemployed people  as
possible. The grant will assist the emerging employer to  pay  the  salaries
of his or her employees for the first few months until the  embryo  business
can afford the total remuneration package of the staff.

Financial institutions must help to administer the programme at  grass-roots
level. Emerging entrepreneurs have to be assisted with  business  plans  and
financial  management.  Experienced  local  business   people,   through   a
mentorship programme, should be involved in guiding  emerging  entrepreneurs
towards success. The key to the success of the  employment  grant  programme
lies in the deregulation  of  the  labour  market  for  the  informal  small
business sector.

The proposed New NP employment grant programme will spawn many benefits:  It
will expand the economic base for accelerated growth in the  GDP  to  reduce
unemployment; it  will  serve  as  an  incubator  for  entrepreneurship  and
private  initiative;  it  will  restore  dignity  to  the   breadwinner   by
empowering him or her to care for his or her own  family;  it  will  reverse
the growing culture of dependence  on  social  grants  in  our  society  and
restore the principles of self-help and responsibility  in  the  individual;
and, it will serve as a safety net to prevent  many  new  entrepreneurs  and
skilled labourers emerging from the Extended  Public  Works  Programme  from
being lost because of the lack of job opportunities.

The only question that remains is to determine whether  we  can  master  the
testosterone and the oestrogen to bite the bullet and do  what  we  have  to
do.

Mr A BLAAS: Deputy Speaker, the  policy  framework  promotes  growth  within
macroeconomic constraints by  focusing  on  specific  actions  to  stimulate
growth, although slower than anticipated, but still  positive.  The  success
of achieving the growth objectives, however, relies heavily on the  capacity
to translate these policies into action.

There is general consensus on the macroeconomic forecast and  the  alignment
of the Medium-Term Budget Policy Framework in  terms  of  these  indicators.
The main focus on job creation  through  direct  and  indirect  measures  is
welcome. The focused approach to assist  the  vulnerable  and  poor  through
social support measures will help the most needy  in  our  communities.  May
the time arrive when people will become  less  dependent  on  the  state  by
having the opportunity to be self-sufficient. The  contribution  to  nation-
building  by  citizens  who  can  retain  their  dignity   should   not   be
underestimated.

With regard to their concerns, success in achieving the  objectives  of  the
policies  depends  on  the  capacity  to  give  effect  to  the   supporting
programmes underpinning the policies. This capacity at this stage  is  under
suspicion.

A further concern is the reduction in the Defence budget to 1,3% of the  GDP
in the outside year compared to an international norm  of  1,8%  to  2%  for
countries similar to South Africa.  International  commitments  without  the
necessary financial support resulted in the landward capabilities of the  SA
National Defence Force being severely compromised. This must be rebuilt  and
sufficient  funding  must  be  made  available  to   support   international
commitments.

The Safety and Security allocation  is  also  questioned.  The  SA  National
Defence Force supports the police services, and this support must  be  taken
over by them. Considering the scope of the existing  support,  the  required
allocation to the SAPS is not reflected in the policy framework.

The policy framework gives consistency for future economic  expectation,  as
well as the confidence that has manifested itself in  the  market  reactions
that were experienced  after  the  announcements.  Defence  and  Safety  and
Security budgets must, however, be revisited. [Applause.]
Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker, while we know that  Government  thrives  on
taxes paid by citizens, it is also worth noting or taken into  account  what
Government does in its efforts to assist citizens.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement envisages the reform of taxation  of
retirement savings. This measure will  assist  in  having  the  pensions  of
senior citizens not being bled  through  taxation.  Tax  relief  to  support
business investment will go a long way towards alleviating  joblessness  and
poverty, as investors will have no difficulty in  putting  up  factories  in
deprived areas or even using factories that just stand vacant  and  deserted
because of high taxation currently.

The R37 billion set aside in  the  budget  framework  will  go  a  long  way
towards contributing to the  creation  of  jobs  and  the  reinforcement  of
higher education, transformation and skills. We hope that the  promise  made
by His Excellency the President that a million jobs  will  be  created  will
not remain hollow, as has been the slogan of the ANC in 1999 that, if  voted
for,  they  would  create  jobs.  Five  years  down  the  line,  more  jobs,
regardless of how menial they were, have been lost.

Like we said in our response to the state  of  the  nation  address  earlier
this year, Government will introduce labour-intensive construction  methods.
Each person, according to us, has to live by the sweat of  their  brow.  The
doling out of food packages should cease.  The  money  used  for  grants  in
respect of able-bodied individuals should be used for job creation  so  that
those people can earn a living.

We learnt only this morning from the Minister of Finance that large sums  of
money had to be returned to donor countries because  provinces  were  unable
to utilize the money as prescribed. This should not be allowed  to  continue
as this was in the very provinces where poverty and joblessness abound.

Finally, we appreciate the good intentions laid down in the  statement,  but
remain sceptical whether the envisaged skills  development  programmes  will
be realised as at present 21 000 public servants  have  been  identified  as
surplus to  their  establishments,  and  two  months  have  passed  with  no
training  programmes,  as  promised,  to  ensure  their  retention  in   the
Government service. However, we shall support the statement.

Mr G D SCHNEEMANN: Madam Deputy Speaker, Comrade Minister, comrades and  hon
members, today as we debate the Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  the
first decade of democracy and freedom is just a few months  away,  a  decade
during which our country has changed into what is today a  vastly  different
country to the one which existed prior to 1994.

The 2003 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement continues  along  the  path  of
change through an expansionary fiscal stance, fighting poverty and  reducing
unemployment, raising  the  level  of  public  and  private  investment  and
building sustainable communities.

Some of the key programmes in attaining the  above  include  the  integrated
sustainable rural development programme, the urban  renewal  programme,  the
expanded public works programme, and the skills development  programme.  The
13 rural development and eight urban renewal programmes  focus  on  reducing
poverty and underdevelopment. In the 13 rural  nodes,  155  anchor  projects
have been identified  that  will  help  to  create  viable  and  sustainable
communities in the long term.

The development and the  urban  and  rural  nodes  are  creating  employment
opportunities, improving and expanding  existing  infrastructure,  providing
housing opportunities and releasing land for agricultural purposes,  amongst
others. The urban renewal and rural development  programmes  are  not  about
dictating where people should live and work, but rather about giving  people
the choice to decide where they would like to live and work.

The housing delivery programme is playing  an  important  role  through  the
provision  of  housing  opportunities.  Between  1994  and  2003, 1  985 545
subsidies were approved while at the same time 481 373 houses built  in  the
apartheid era  were  transferred  to  the  occupants  through  the  discount
benefits scheme. This amounts to almost R48 billion worth of housing  assets
which have been transferred to South African citizens. The housing  delivery
programme has impacted positively on  the  living  conditions  of  over  six
million people.

Whilst these are highly impressive achievements, still more work  will  have
to be undertaken to reduce the housing backlog. The national housing  summit
held last week is expected to strengthen  the  housing  delivery  programme,
with role-players in housing joining together with Government  in  a  united
effort to speed up housing delivery.

At this point I would like to say to the hon Semple that there is no  crisis
in housing, as she indicated in her statement in this House on  13  November
this year. [Interjections.] Perhaps if she had taken the time to attend  the
housing summit in her capacity as the DA spokesperson on housing, she  could
have made  a  meaningful  contribution  towards  the  strengthening  of  the
housing delivery programme.  [Interjections.]  By  not  attending,  the  hon
Semple has sent out a  very  clear  message,  namely  that  the  DA  is  not
concerned about improving the living conditions of the poor.

The development of our rural areas will  assist  in  stemming  migration  to
urban areas and will hopefully  see  a  reversed  trend  taking  place  with
people going back to their homes. In Brazil, the development of rural  areas
has seen such a trend taking place. The benefits of growth and tourism  need
to be harnessed to impact on rural towns. Rural towns need  to  be  assisted
in identifying opportunities that will attract tourists to their  towns  and
in turn stimulate local economic growth.

The renewal of urban areas is not  restricted  to  the  eight  nodes.  In  a
number of cities, improvement areas have been identified.  In  Johannesburg,
for example, initiatives such as the  Nelson  Mandela  Bridge,  the  Newtown
Precinct, and the newly announced provincial government  precinct,  are  all
playing an important role in rejuvenating the city.

The expanded  Public  Works  programme  will  play  a  significant  role  in
creating employment opportunities. The programme is expected to  employ  one
million people over the next five years. During this time,  people  will  be
trained whilst being employed. Once they  exit  the  programme,  the  skills
they have gained will assist them in increasing their capacity  to  earn  an
income. The three spheres of Government will have to ensure that  they  work
in a co-ordinated  manner  so  that  this  programme  achieves  its  desired
outcomes.

The various sector education training authorities, together  with  business,
will play an important role in the training of 72 000  unemployed  learners,
as agreed at the growth and development summit. To date, more  than  26  000
learners have been registered.

Critical to the success of this expanded  Public  Works  programme  and  the
learnership programme will be the involvement of all stakeholders  at  local
level. This includes business, civil society, and the religious sector.  All
South Africans should see this as an opportunity to lend a helping  hand  in
pushing  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.  This  is  an  opportunity   for
businesspeople across the country to come forward and  volunteer  to  mentor
those who have gained new skills as they seek to find ways  of  using  those
skills to sustain themselves economically in the long term.

Economic  growth  will  be  stimulated   through   increased   spending   on
infrastructures  such  as  roads,  the  provision  and  upgrading  of  water
services, the maintenance and building of schools,  clinics  and  hospitals,
the maintenance and upgrading of rail services and ports  and  the  building
of new prisons.

One of the decisions taken at the  growth  and  development  summit  was  to
support local procurement  and  intensify  support  for  the  Proudly  South
African campaign. These are areas in which all South Africans  can  actively
participate, in particular by  purchasing  locally  made  goods,  employment
opportunities can be increased and South African companies need  to  produce
goods and services to meet the demand of domestic consumers.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement is in line with the  key  programmes
of the RDP, namely, meeting basic needs, building  the  economy,  developing
human resources, and democratising the state and society. The focus  of  the
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement is on creating  communities,  households
and livelihoods that will be self-sustainable in the long term.

In conclusion, I wish to refer to the speech of Mr Gary Player, the  captain
of the international team at the President's Cup, when he  said  that  under
the leadership of President Thabo Mbeki, South Africa was becoming  a  great
nation. He further called on all South Africans to join and help  in  making
South Africa an even greater nation.

We need more people like Mr Player,  who  recognise  that  South  Africa  is
indeed a great place to be in. If we all adopted the attitude of Mr  Player,
the nation would become an even greater nation. We have made  much  progress
in rebuilding our country and we will have to continue to do more.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement clearly defines the road ahead.  The
map is clear, we know where we are going and where our  destination  is.  We
know and understand that there will be challenges that  we  will  encounter.
We are under no false illusions that the road ahead will  be  easy,  but  we
are confident that the ANC will take us there. We are  confident  that  this
ANC-led Government, and the one after next year's elections,  will  take  us
to our destination.

Together with the ANC, we will continue to make it happen where we live.  We
will continue to push back the frontiers of poverty, and  we  will  continue
to improve the quality of life of the peoples of South Africa. As  the  ANC,
we support the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement. [Applause.]

Dr S E  M  PHEKO:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement has not moved social policy from  rhetoric  to  reality.  The  PAC
believes that the budget has not  met  the  demands  of  the  urgent  social
agenda in this country.

For instance, how far are people's homes from clinics  and  police  stations
in the rural areas? What about medicines and  beds  in  hospitals?  Why  are
there not enough doctors in our medical institutions?  How  many  ambulances
are there? Why are there  still  children  who  cannot  learn  in  a  decent
classroom and some learn under the trees?

Sixty percent of matric students have dropped  out  of  class  because  they
could not afford the school fees. Many university  students  are  unable  to
complete their degrees. Why is this so in a nation  of  gold,  diamonds  and
platinum? Our platinum fetches as high a price as over US  $761  per  ounce,
this is over R5 000 per ounce.

Why has our country become the biggest exporter of teachers  while  we  lack
teachers here, and some are injudiciously  retrenched  as  if  this  country
does not need education? Is losing over 4 700 teachers  to  other  countries
not a sign that our teachers are not properly  rewarded,  and  the  teaching
profession not given the respect it deserves?

The Budget has not made adequate services available to all.  The  Government
has consistently spent a maximum of 0,5% of the national budget  to  broaden
the availability of basic water supply services as opposed  to  the  minimum
3% of the national budget regarded as an international standard.

At the current rate, it will take 20 to 25 years before basic  services  are
available to the majority of people in this  country.  We  need  a  national
budget which is geared at removing the two nations syndrome of the rich  and
the poor, a budget which addresses the fundamental objectives for which  the
liberation struggle was fought in this country.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker, the alleviation of poverty being  our  prime
focus, it  is  pleasing  to  note  that  the  Medium-Term  Budget  has  been
established in line with this aim.

The MF is extremely pleased at the department's aims and focus to  intensify
growth  and  development.  The  reinforcement  of   education   and   skills
development is a strong mechanism to mobilise our people to advancement.  We
all know that an educated nation makes for a strong nation. This  will  also
cater for greater social development.

The MF celebrates the reduction of inflation and a lower interest rate  that
allows for an international recovery and domestic demand.  We  are  glad  to
meet this Medium-Term Budget with the earnest  determination  to  accelerate
growth and employment creation, reduce poverty and broaden participation  in
our economy.

It is encouraging to note  that  inflation  is  expected  to  remain  within
target range, with growth rising to 4% in 2006.  A  continuous  decrease  in
interest and debt as a percentage of the GDP is sure  to  please  many.  The
increase in shares to local and provincial governments will  greatly  assist
these spheres of government with delivery.

The further extension  of  the  child  support  grant  is  needed  and  very
pleasing. Our  children  are  a  priority  and  the  Government's  extensive
attention to their wellbeing is encouraging. The child justice centres  that
are being established are also promising.

The MF voices its support for the framework  that  is  based  on  a  growth-
orientated  fiscal  policy  and  supports  the  Medium-Term  Budget   Policy
Statement. [Applause.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Thank you,  Madam  Speaker.  In  supporting  the  Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement there are nevertheless some serious reservations.

Even though social spending has increased steadily from the late 1990s,  the
huge volume of  further  social  spending,  as  recently  announced  by  the
Minister of Finance, must be  seen  as  well-timed  to  woo  the  masses  as
elections approach which Government no doubt hopes will mark their  manifest
failure to date to tackle two current and critical issues, namely, Aids  and
unemployment. If, however, the ANC-led Government is indeed sincere in  this
plan for these huge increases in social spending  without  concommitant  and
significant increases  in  taxation,  the  national  budget's  deficit  will
inevitably grow along with  all  the  problems  that  that  situation  would
impose.

Some economic experts are of the opinion that an increase of 8%  to  10%  in
the VAT rate would be required to fund  a  full-scale  Aids  prevention  and
treatment programme and to create jobs through Public Works for  only  about
one third of the total number of unemployed. It is interesting to note  that
First World countries such as Sweden, with a  much  bigger  tax-paying  base
than ours, are reducing social  spending  while  we  propose  these  massive
increases.  Clearly,  further  debate  is  required  with  regard   to   the
sustainability of such overambitious social spending by Government. I  thank
you.

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement deals with issues that have been debated before. For that  matter,
some of the intentions in the  statement  are  consistent  with  what  Azapo
would like to happen in our country.

Having  said  that,  Azapo  is,  however,  concerned  that   some   of   the
pronouncements  in  the  policy  statement,  including  those  of   previous
statements, have not been implemented.  For  example,  time  and  again  job
creation has never been omitted from previous statements and rightfully  so.
But unfortunately jobs have been lost and  continue  to  be  lost  severely,
particularly in the textile industry.

Time and again the Minister has  talked  about  the  Expanded  Public  Works
Programme and has gone on to put resources aside for this purpose,  yet  the
fact that the Department of Public Works has not created the jobs  that  are
intended should be a cause for concern to all of us.  It  therefore  remains
to be seen whether Government will intervene this time around  so  that  the
intended expansion of the Public Works Programme can materialise.

Recently  we  have  passed  legislation  on   broad-based   black   economic
empowerment. We have been able to define what broad-based ...

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Order! Hon members, please!

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: ... black economic empowerment means.  But  before  the
ink is dry, champions of capitalism have already decided who their  partners
are and redefined broad-based economic empowerment, the  types  of  vehicles
to be used by communities to access finance and the types of deals and  when
these deals should materialise. Owners of finance have  started  to  dictate
terms on empowerment deals. Fronting has been replaced by  a  collection  of
organisations of the poor led by would-be real partners emanating  from  the
black elite. These kinds of activities should be strictly  monitored.  Azapo
is of the view that unless Government intervenes both at job creation  level
and checking what kind of empowerment deals are entered into the  poor  will
continue to be marginalised. I thank you.

Ms N M TSHEOLE: Deputy Speaker and hon members, allow me to quote  from  the
book of Exodus, chapter 14 verses 11 and 12:


  Wat het jy ons aangedoen dat jy ons uit Egipte laat trek het? ... Dit  is
  vir ons beter om vir hulle te werk as om hier in die woestyn om  te  kom.
  [What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? ... It would  have
  been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!]

These were the words of the Israelites to Moses when  they  were  confronted
with difficulties in the desert, on their way out  of  Egypt.  Some  of  the
voices that I hear here remind me of those voices. It looks like they  would
prefer to have been in the past than in the present situation.

We heard what the hon member Nefolovhodwe said. Yes, we know that there  are
problems and in fact in his introduction to the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement the Minister said: `` We can be proud  of  our  past  achievements
while contemplating challenges ahead with resolve and humility.''  The  fact
that there are challenges cannot be denied. But definitely we are  proud  of
our achievements.

Idasa, in their presentation to  the  Joint  Budget  Committee,  also  said:
``The budget once again facilitates service delivery to the poor  but  there
is a long road ahead  in  realising  socioeconomic  rights.''  This  is  the
attitude that one would expect members of Parliament to adopt - to  say  and
acknowledge that there are challenges ahead.

Yes, the road ahead  is  still  very  long,  because  the  new  dispensation
started on an  empty  but  soiled  slate.  The  current  budget  presents  a
complete paradigm shift from the pre-1994 model of budgeting in that  it  is
deracialised, it prioritises socioeconomic rights, it advocates  sustainable
development,  it  targets  poverty  through  redistribution   of   available
resources, it is expansionary  and  progressive  in  that  it  progressively
addresses social development in the medium-term while contributing to  human
and physical capital formation required for long-term sustainable growth.

There is no way in which these two can be taken together and  I'm  surprised
that the hon Millin compares South Africa  to  Sweden.  Sweden  is  reducing
their social spending while South Africa is increasing it. And yet,  at  the
same time, she makes reference to poverty. How would you address poverty  if
you cannot create jobs in the meantime  if  people  are  not  skilled?  This
budget makes  provision  for  them.  It  makes  provision  for  the  capital
formation in human resources.

Social spending over the next three years should show that this  budget  has
increased to R164 billion. So you can imagine what it was initially.  So  we
find  that  there  is  really  an  increase  and  these  are  some  of   the
achievements that we have to be proud of.

We looked at our Department of Health, for example. They recently  announced
the roll-out of the antiretroviral  programme,  which  means  the  plan  for
comprehensive treatment and care for HIV-positive  and  Aids  patients.  I'm
here making a distinction between HIV-positive and  Aids  patients,  because
there is a great distinction. The debates  outside  usually  concentrate  on
coalescing the two as though  people  who  are  diagnosed  HIV-positive  are
already suffering from Aids. And these are the confusions that  are  usually
raised in the debate over Aids, as though nothing is being done.

We should also look at the fact that the programme that the  Government  has
for HIV and Aids has to emphasise prevention to ensure that the millions  of
people who are not infected should remain that way, while at the  same  time
Government wants to attend to the 5 million  who  are  infected.  But  other
than what people usually promote outside,  they  bring  these  two  together
like nothing is being done. It's tantamount to saying  that  those  who  are
not positive should be ignored and should not be told to abstain  or  to  be
careful or to change their lifestyle. So these are issues that  need  to  be
taken into consideration. [Applause.]

We also looked at education. When we look at education, the  current  budget
looks  first  at  the  transformation  of  higher  education.  The  Minister
explained why that had to  be  done.  We  know  that  education  at  certain
institutions was regarded as inferior education. People who  graduated  from
institutions such as bush university were not respected. So this had  to  be
brought together. Transformation had to take place, unfortunately.

There was also the  attitude  towards  institutions  such  as  technikons  -
people  were  not  always  willing  to  go  to   technikons,   because   the
qualifications from technikons were always regarded as  inferior,  which  is
not right. So this had to be transformed in order to address  these  issues.
And we find that the budget also makes room for  increasing  allocations  to
infrastructure in learning institutions, especially in the  poor  areas.  So
these are issues that need to be taken into consideration.  We  cannot  just
look at the long-term and seem as though we are  like  the  Israelites,  who
want to go back to Egypt.

With regard to education,  we  also  looked  at  poor  students  who  go  to
tertiary institutions. There is the National Student  Financial  Aid  Scheme
that has been announced. Students who are poor can go there for  assistance.
But what is important is that people  should  know  that  the  state  cannot
offer free  education  at  tertiary  institutions,  because  of  the  social
benefit that is limited with regard to that. There's  more  benefit  to  the
individual than to society and so the state needs  to  choose,  as  the  hon
member indicated, between competing needs.

We looked at social development. We have been  saying,  even  when  we  were
passing the Bills - the Social  Assistance  Bill  and  the  Social  Security
Agency Bill - that judging by the increase in the budget, viz  in  terms  of
spending on  social  development,  the  number  of  beneficiaries  receiving
grants has increased. They now total about 7,1 million. We  also  know  that
the child support grant has also increased  too,  and  that  they  are  also
deepening the extension from 7 years to 14 years.

These issues show that this budget is really concentrating  on  the  issues,
but at the same time we know that there are skills  development  and  Public
Works programmes in place. The hon  member  referred  to  the  Public  Works
Programme which is trying to address those issues. We know  that  there  are
issues that have to be considered, such as sustainability.  We  cannot  just
go onto these things without taking care. That's why the budget  has  to  be
progressive and it has to be expansionary. It has to ensure  and  make  room
for sustainability. We cannot just embark on these  things  without  looking
to the future.

There are quite a number of things that one can quote  with  regard  to  the
Social Services, the socioeconomic right, like unemployment ...  Thank  you.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Speaker and hon members,  let's  just  pause
to remind  ourselves  of  the  purpose  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement. It was introduced about five years ago for the  first  time,  and
the objective was very clearly to place before Parliament those ideas  which
we will use finally to shape the Budget. In this case  the  Budget  will  be
tabled in this House, all things being equal, on 19 February next  year.  So
this point is quite an important point because it  invites  Parliament  and,
through Parliament, all of South Africa into the process of  finalising  the
Budget against the fiscal framework that is clear  and  certainly  a  policy
direction.

In this context, or against this backdrop, therefore it is appropriate  that
we recognise the important contribution of the Joint Budget Committee.  When
it was first introduced, I think a number of us had misgivings about how  it
would go but I think that if we look at the inputs  from  the  Joint  Budget
Committee now, as tabled in the ATCs  of  yesterday,  that  report  suggests
that the process has matured under the joint leadership of the hon Nene  and
the hon Ralane. We would like  to  express  our  appreciation  to  them,  to
advise them that the system is working and to say  to  all  members  of  the
Joint Budget Committee that we value their inputs.

In the approach taken by the Joint Budget Committee  leadership  in  shaping
the hearings, the  five  themes  -  social  services  and  social  security,
economic growth  and  development,  urban  renewal  and  rural  development,
international  relations  and  peace  support  in  Africa  and  justice  and
protection services  -  cover  the  span  of  all  the  key  decisions  that
Government must pay attention to and I think that, as the report  indicates,
the focus that we have taken is correct. This is supported  largely  by  the
way in which departments have interacted with  the  Joint  Budget  Committee
and as reflected in its report. And again  I  would  like  to  say  that  we
consider the advice of the committee appropriate in the circumstances.

Turning to the subjects raised in the debate, it is important  that  we  all
remain alive to the complexities  of  the  global  environment.  Changes  to
global output, and  therefore  global  demand  patterns,  and  the  fall  in
exports have a profound impact on our own  performance.  Similarly,  changes
in the trends in capital flows will have an impact on a country that has  as
low a savings ratio as South Africa has. And what is important, and again  I
would like to express appreciation to the  Joint  Budget  Committee  because
they engage with these issues, is that we understand  the  difficulties  and
we seek partners, as the hon Hogan pointed out, especially with  like-minded
countries such as Brazil and India, to carve a different perspective in  the
global political economy going forward.

A number of members, starting with the hon Rabie, have said that this is  an
election Budget. Now if you want an election Budget,  hon  Rabie,  you  will
get one, but this is not it.  You  will  get  an  election  Budget  that  is
populist, inorganic and silly. This is  not  it.  This  is  careful.  It  is
organic. It builds on past performance. It takes a direction from  where  we
have been. It measures the  capacity  of  Government  to  absorb  money,  to
utilise money correctly and to implement programmes.

This is not an election Budget. It's not an  election  Budget,  because  the
ANC does not need an election Budget. We are  confident  of  the  ground  we
stand on. [Applause.] But if we were wavering  and  if  we  had  any  doubts
about our own position we might chose to be populist, but this is not it.  I
can give you budgets from different countries and show you what an  election
budget is, but this I assure you is not it.

Similarly, I don't want colleagues to be too overawed by the growth  in  the
deficit, because growth in debt is  a  big  problem  whether  it's  in  your
personal life, in your family circumstances or in the country. There  is  no
joy in debt. It will catch you later. Because if we only  want  to  use  the
deficit as a measure then there is a country that has grown from  a  surplus
to a deficit of close to 6% of its GDP this year, largely to fuel a  war  in
a country far away, and if you  say  that  is  a  good  budget  because  the
deficit is large, I ask you to think again. Similarly, there  is  a  country
not too far to the north of this country where the  deficit  is  very  large
and where inflation is now 540%, where a budget was tabled last week  and  I
say to you: If you think that is a  good  budget,  because  the  deficit  is
large, think again.

We have to understand the context of what we are doing here, understand  the
ability of Government to change and to drive changes and to  recognise  what
we can do and what we can't do. We are  not  closed  to  all  ideas,  but  I
certainly  would  like  to  invite  the  hon  Nefolovhodwe,  when  he   says
Government must intervene in respect of jobs, to tell us what to  do.  Don't
say intervene. Let's have an open  discourse  about  these  issues,  because
it's not an opposition concern that there is unemployment. In fact  the  ANC
represents the largest number of unemployed in this House  as  we  sit  here
here. [Applause.] It's a demographic fact.

We have to be concerned about our constituency so if there are  ideas  don't
hide them under a bushel. You know the hon Tsheole was very  biblical  so  I
have taken it forward. Don't hide your lamp  under  a  bushel,  my  brother.
Bring it forward. Let's share the light, because that is what Parliament  is
about and that is what the Medium-Term Budget  Policy  Statement  is  about.
Let me also ... [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: [Inaudible.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Of course, I do.  Of  course,  I  do.  Let  me  ...
[Interjections.] No, it's not a bush. It's not the one with the 6%  deficit,
nor is it the one that the two Australians hit balls under on  Sunday.  This
is something else we are talking about.

I want to supply the hon President of the PAC, the hon Dr Pheko - if  he  is
still in the House - with a copy of the Constitution. It is very clear  this
is not a document he is familiar with. [Laughter.] It's very clear  that  he
doesn't know who has responsibility for  what  in  this  country.  I  really
would like to supply the hon President of the PAC with the  Constitution.  I
would also  like  to  have  a  discussion  with  him  about  what  he  calls
international standards, because I think he makes  these  things  up  as  he
goes along.

But, hon Deputy Speaker, I would like express sincere appreciation  for  the
leadership provided by the Joint Budget Committee.  We  have  a  very  clear
idea of the issues that have been raised and of those that have been  deeply
and properly considered by the Joint Budget Committee and  I  want  to  give
this House and all of South Africa the assurance that we will  consider  the
advice that we received from this House as we finalise  the  allocations  to
various departments over the course of the next fortnight.  Thank  you  very
much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

         CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON FINANCE -
                    MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I move:


  That the report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Mr N M NENE: Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  Of  the  15  minutes  I'm
allocated I may use three minutes, because if  this  is  not  unfair  labour
practice, I don't know what it is.

Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, when the Minister  of  Finance  tabled
the Medium-Term  Budget  Policy  Statement,  he  also  tabled  the  adjusted
estimates for a number of departments that had requested additional  funding
for unavoidable and unforeseen expenditure. Some  of  the  departments  were
also applying for roll-overs for reasons that were explained in the  report.
With regard to the departments  referred  to  above,  allow  me  to  address
myself to a few of them because of their significance.

The Department of Provincial and Local  Government  receives  an  additional
amount  of  R34  million  in  order  to   rehabilitate   the   flood-damaged
infrastructure in the Western Cape and to settle outstanding liabilities  in
the 11 municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal. This is to  address  the  legacy  of
apartheid where there were a number of municipalities where staff had to  be
transferred owing to restructuring. The committee was satisfied that  indeed
these expenses were unforeseeable and unavoidable. In line with the  mandate
of this department of promoting a national  system  of  integrated  and  co-
operative governance, the additional allocations are in order.

The Department of Water Affairs also receives an  additional  allocation  of
R346 million, mainly to respond to the need for emergency  water  supply  in
drought-affected areas and to fight forest fires. This is also in line  with
the ANC's commitment to the provision of basic services  to  the  people  of
South Africa and ensuring a healthy environment.

The Department of Communications receives R750 million to  provide  for  the
recapitalisation of the Post Office. This is done with the proviso that  the
Postbank will now be separated from the rest of the  business  of  the  Post
Office and with an agreement on a business plan  to  put  the  agency  on  a
sound  financial  footing.  We  sincerely  hope  that  the   Department   of
Communications will ensure that outstanding issues in  the  finalisation  of
this matter are resolved as  speedily  as  possible.  This  is  particularly
crucial because the Postbank mainly caters for the needs  of  the  poor  and
marginalised who are commonly referred to as the unbankable.

The Postbank is also an important player in the  rural  areas  in  promoting
the culture of saving that this country needs so desperately. Ensuring  that
this institution is  put  on  a  sound  financial  footing  is  therefore  a
responsible thing to do, but  extreme  caution  must  be  exercised  that  a
precedent is  not  set  for  parastatals  to  run  their  financial  affairs
irresponsibly. The Joint Budget Committee has undertaken to  work  with  the
Portfolio Committee on Communications to hold the department to  account  on
this matter and to avoid a reoccurrence of this.

My colleagues will speak on the adjustments for other departments  as  dealt
with  by  the  committee.  Allow  me  to  remind  hon   members   of   their
responsibility once again of ensuring the quality of the spending  of  these
allocations  in  their  respective  sector  committees  as   they   exercise
oversight. The ANC supports the Adjusted Estimates of National  Expenditure,
and I thank you.

Dr  P  J  RABIE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  hon  Minister  ...
[Interjections.] I will not be distracted by the New NP.

The Public Finance Management Act  of  1999  stipulates  that  the  National
Revenue Fund may pay  adjusted  required  amounts  of  money  shown  in  the
Schedule adjustments in the Appropriation Bill. If you  study  the  Adjusted
Estimates of National Expenditure, it's easy to discern  that  the  ANC  has
failed regarding unemployment, Aids and crime.

The DA welcomes the statement of the hon Minister of Finance that just  less
than R12 billion has been allocated  to  fight  Aids  over  the  next  three
financial years. What is of concern is that  60%  of  this  amount  will  be
transferred incrementally to the nine  provinces  via  the  equitable  share
allocation. There is no guarantee that this Aids  allocation  will  actually
go to Aids-related treatment.

Idasa's Aids Budget Unit pointed out to  the  Joint  Budget  Committee  that
less than a third of the equitable share incrementally increased by the  hon
Minister of Finance was actually spent  by  the  provinces  on  Aids-related
interventions in the 2002-03 financial year. What  is  unacceptable  is  the
delay  of  antiretroviral  treatment.  It  is  unpardonable!  The   HIV/Aids
antiretroviral programme must be implemented. The war on Aids must  be  won.
The DA appeals to all role-players to fight Aids in a proactive manner.
The Joint Budget Committee heard submissions from departments,  stakeholders
and civil bodies between 14 and 19 November. The committee -  and  allow  me
to thank the chairpersons and all the  members  -  listened  extensively  to
whether departments were planning their expenditures and  seeking  effective
implementation.

The Department of Defence,  and  in  particular  the  hon  Deputy  Minister,
mentioned that the department assists in  internal  crime  prevention,  will
assist the SA Police Service in the general election and that  3 000  troops
were deployed in five African countries, but  they  have  profound  problems
regarding depleted and outdated stocks, etc.

Ek het in my voorlegging rakende die Mini-Begroting gemeld dat  die  DA  die
grootste agting en respek vir die SA Nasionale  Weermag  het.  Wat  vir  ons
egter moeilik is om te verstaan is dat die SA Nasionale Weermag  werklik  19
nuwe, pasaangestelde admiraals en generaals nodig het.  Aantygings  word  in
die media gemaak,  en  ek  verwys  spesifiek  na  die  hoofartikel  van  die
grootste Afrikaanse dagblad verlede Maandag,  dat  kleur  'n  baie  ernstige
kriterium was met die aanstelling van hierdie admiraals en generaals.

Die DA is nié teen swart bemagtiging nie, maar dit moet  gedoen  word  binne
'n gegewe bekostigbare tydperk. [Tussenwerpsels.] Ek is  bewus  van  hoeveel
generaals daar in die vorige weermag was, maar dit is nie ter sake nie.  Ons
bepaal ons by die huidige aansuiweringsdebat. U wat van  fiskale  dissipline
praat, moet dit toepas. Die ander argument wat gebruik  word,  is  dat  daar
reeds 207 generaals is; een per 338 soldate. Hierdie aanstellings is  gedoen
teen die agtergrond van 'n onvoldoende verdedigingsbegroting, en dit is  nie
my eie woorde nie, maar wel dié van die agb Adjunkminister van Verdediging.

Aanstellings wat slegs op kleur gegrond is, is moreel moeilik  verdedigbaar.
'n Ernstige beroep word gedoen  op  alle  bemagtigingsinstansies  om  op  'n
deursigtige  wyse  hiermee  te  werk  te  gaan   sodat   dit   nie   verdere
rassespanning in die Weermag ontketen nie. Die SA Nasionale  Weermag  moenie
verpolitiseer word nie. Hierdie is  'n  uiters  netelige  aangeleentheid  en
moet baie versigtig gehanteer word.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[I mentioned in my submission regarding the Mini Budget that  the  DA  holds
the SA National Defence Force in high esteem and has  the  greatest  respect
for it. However, what is difficult for us to understand  is  the  fact  that
the SA  National  Defence  Force  actually  needs  the  19  newly  appointed
admirals and generals. Allegations are being made by the  media,  and  I  am
referring specifically to the  editorial  of  the  biggest  Afrikaans  daily
paper last  Monday,  that  colour  was  a  very  serious  criterion  in  the
appointment of these admirals and generals.

The DA is not against black empowerment, but it must be done within a  given
affordable period. [Interjections.] I am aware of how  many  generals  there
were in the previous defence force, but that is irrelevant. We are  focusing
on  the  current  adjustment  debate.  You  who  are  talking  about  fiscal
discipline must apply it. The other argument that  is  being  used  is  that
there  are  207  generals  already;  one  for  every  338  soldiers.   These
appointments were done against  the  background  of  an  inadequate  defence
budget, and these are not my own words, but indeed those of the  hon  Deputy
Minister of Defence.

Appointments which  are  only  based  on  colour  are  difficult  to  defend
morally. A serious appeal is being made to all empowerment  institutions  to
go about it in a transparent manner so that  it  does  not  unleash  further
racial tension in the Defence Force. The SA National  Defence  Force  should
not be politicised. This is an extremely contentious matter  and  should  be
handled very carefully.]

The Department of Justice is at present struggling  to  fill  vacant  posts.
The departmental budget showed some savings on personnel. The  question  one
has to ask oneself, however, is whether the department is able to  render  a
service if the personnel is inadequate.

Another aspect of  concern  in  Justice  is  that  the  department  lacks  a
computerised accounting system.  An  official  from  the  department  stated
during public hearings that some areas had  no  telephones  or  security  to
prevent theft of computers if they  did  receive  them.  This  situation  is
clearly untenable. I call upon the hon Minister  to  reprioritise  and  find
the resources to rectify security in and around courts.

The DA welcomes additional spending to improve the sector policing  strategy
and the Protection and Security Services Division for border post  policing.
The 46 new child justice centres are  also  a  positive  sign.  What  is  of
concern, however, is the departure of skilled officers and that the  overall
crime rate has  increased  in  nearly  every  category,  especially  violent
crimes.

The DA welcomes the success in calming taxi violence and  the  establishment
and success of the Scorpions. Rural security is  extremely  important.  It's
important to fill the vacuum which will  be  left  when  the  commandos  are
replaced by reservists.
Landelike veiligheid  en  die  onrusbarende  aantal  landelike  moorde  moet
daadwerklik aangespreek word. Die vraag wat ontstaan,  is  of  daar  werklik
voldoende  proaktiewe  voorkomende  maatreëls   getref   word   om   hierdie
onrusbarende verskynsel hok te slaan. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Rural security and the  disturbing  number  of  rural  killings  should  be
actively addressed. The question arises whether adequate proactive  measures
are actually being taken to crack down on this disturbing phenomenon.]

A number of departments are actively engaged in rural  economic  development
and job creation, which is a very commendable action. It was mentioned in  a
number of nongovernmental submissions to the  Joint  Budget  Committee  that
human development does not require more money, but more time  and  community
interest. A bottom-up and not a  top-down  approach  is  needed.  People  at
grass-roots level have the ability to identify their  needs.  A  speaker  at
the hearings described it as follows:
  Community interest is very important, and  people  should  not  just  see
  projects as Government babies, they should own the projects.

At present there is greater access for learners, but  the  education  system
fails to provide adequate highly skilled individuals. The  loss  of  skilled
teachers is also alarming. Budget committee members expressed  concern  that
students who qualified  for  the  NSFAS  bursaries  were  denied  access  to
universities by the high initial registration  fees.  The  hon  Minister  of
Education shared this concern and  it  is  in  the  interest  of  all  South
Africa, especially the youth, that this matter be resolved timeously.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister,  are  you  rising
on a point of order?

The MINISTER OF  FINANCE:  Yes,  sir,  a  point  of  order  and  edification
together. What is the subject matter at hand, I plead to  know.  Is  it  not
the adjustments estimate? Does the hon member have the correct speech?
Dr P J RABIE: If I may respond to that, it was  mentioned  in  the  hearings
... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I think the  member  is  within
his rights. The debate allows  for  a  free-ranging  discussion  of  all  of
Government's  activities,  and  to  that  extent  we   will   permit   that.
[Interjections.]

Dr P J RABIE: Hon Minister, I think I'm  definitely  entitled  to  refer  to
education  since  the  hon  Minister  discussed  it  ...  [Laughter.]  [Time
expired.]

Dr G G WOODS: Deputy Chairperson, the interim fiscal year event that we  are
talking about caters for five different categories  of  adjustments  to  the
Budget. I will not comment on the adjustments concerning the  annual  public
servants salary adjustments, where Government is simply not  in  a  position
to guess what exactly the  increases  ultimately  negotiated  will  be,  and
neither will I comment on the savings and underspending  adjustments,  since
these are  largely  due  to  the  fluctuating  rand.  Therefore,  I'll  only
contemplate adjustments presented in the other three categories before us.

I think what can be said of each of these is  that,  to  some  degree,  they
show up a failure  of  the  annual  budgeting  exercise  to  properly  plan,
anticipate, evaluate and judge what they will do and how they will do it  in
the financial year ahead. Of course, it would be unreasonable to expect  the
Budget to get the future exactly right, but my contention is that the  range
and incidence of adjustments in  the  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill  show
that our budgeting has some methodological weakness.

To comment briefly on these three categories, roll-overs have been an  issue
for a number of years and there  have  been  many  instances  where  it  has
become clear that a department had asked for or had been given  money  which
it never had the ability to spend in the first  place.  This  is  especially
evident in times where  Government  policy  is  compelling  it  to  push  up
allocations for welfare spending.
I think the public outcry when such moneys have not  been  spent  in  recent
years has placed the relevant  departments  in  a  difficult  position.  The
concern here has to be that this causes such spending to be made  with  less
than the necessary concern for value received.

Bigger budgeting planning will make it clear whether the department has  the
ability to fulfil the Government's policy wishes or not,  and  will  give  a
clearer picture of what needs to be enhanced or corrected in order  to  make
such spending possible. We must accept that certain roll-overs are  more  an
issue of timing and that when  the  Accounting  Standards  Board  formulates
accrual accounting for Government, and if they do so for the income side  of
the budget as well, a  number  of  the  so-called  roll-overs  will  not  be
treated as such.

With regard to the category for self-financing  expenditure,  there  is  not
much to say here when looking at the detail, but obviously, there  is  again
the  lack  of  budgeting  foresight  that  has  caused  a  number  of  these
adjustments. The one example that stands out is the R2 002 million  sale  of
armaments. It's hard to  understand  how  no  provision  was  made  for  the
possibility of such income.

Concerning the unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure here, as with  last
year's unforeseeable and unavoidable adjustments, one has an uneasy  feeling
when contemplating the explanations given.  I  can  only  repeat  the  long-
running sentiment of the Portfolio Committee on Finance, and say that we  do
need  a  tighter  and  more  explicit   definition   of   what   constitutes
unforeseeable and unavoidable expenditure than what currently exists in  the
Treasury regulations.

We also need National Treasury to  formulate  strict  and  objective  tests,
which  would  then  apply  consistently  to  all   applications   for   such
adjustments. As things are, and from my years of unauthorised experience  in
Scopa, it seems to me that, as things are, National Treasury  are  something
of a soft touch when it comes to certain applications.

My contention is that the budget approach, as it is inferred  by  the  PFMA,
would help us to considerably tighten up on  how  we  plan  expenditure  and
thus significantly reduce a number of adjustments we need to  consider  each
year. For a few years now, I and others have on the  one  hand  acknowledged
National Treasury's committed role to  driving  the  implementation  of  the
PFMA  across  government,  but   on   the   other   hand,   have   expressed
disappointment at National Treasury's reluctance regarding  the  performance
budgeting system the PFMA  requires,  a  system  which  would  produce  more
considered  and  more  exact  budgets,  which  would  give  Parliament  more
meaningful performance reports to exercise oversight by.

I've always made the point that until budgeting is based  more  on  thorough
and rigourous strategic planning than is currently the case, and  on  having
all intended activities costed, it would be  of  questionable  value.  It's,
therefore, most gratifying to  hear  the  National  Treasury  official,  who
appeared before the  committee  last  week,  make  these  exact  points  and
explain these as in large part the reason why we have  as  many  adjustments
to contend with as we do.

I subsequently phoned the official, Mr Tesh Oprende, of the  Budget  Office,
and learnt from him that the National Treasury is now setting up  a  costing
unit with a  view  towards  strengthening  budget  exercises.  We  certainly
welcome this. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members  who  are  standing
in the aisles, would you please take your seats! Order, hon members!

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Chairperson, the New NP will  support  the  Adjustments
Appropriation Bill. Over the past 10  years  the  inflation  rate  in  South
Africa has come down from a staggering 20% plus,  inherited  from  the  pre-
1994 beleagured economy, to less than 5% at present - it is 4,5% today.  The
solution to the problem was to liberate the economy and create a climate  of
monetary and fiscal discipline for it to operate in.

The  Government  must  also  be  congratulated  on  the  moderate,  positive
economic growth rate of between 2% and 4%, which has been  sustained  for  a
period of 10 years in a  row.  The  business  plan  that  bore  these  sweet
fruits,  as  the  Minister  said,  was  the  implementation  of  the   sound
macroeconomic policy that we  now  call  Gear.  What  a  far  cry  from  the
chilling statement by Mr Nelson  Mandela,  in  his  first  speech  from  the
balcony of Cape Town City Hall, that he intended to  nationalise  the  mines
and the banks. Reason, however, prevailed.

The major problem facing us now is that 4% growth will never  root  out  the
poverty fuelled by the alarmingly high unemployment  rate.  Presently,  this
runs at 40% plus and rising. South Africa needs to exceed 6% growth  in  the
GDP. The only sustainable way to combat unemployment, apart from  liberating
labour, is to bake a bigger economic cake that  would  produce  more  slices
for more people each year.
Imagine how disappointed I was to hear South Africa's  Minister  of  Finance
reply to a question of mine that the South African economy is  not  able  to
exceed the predicted annual growth rate of 4%  over  the  next  five  years,
while emerging  countries  across  the  world  will  average  more  than  6%
``because  Verwoerd,  in  1953,  decided  to  ban   blacks   from   studying
mathematics''.

The time, surely, has now arrived, after a decade of government,  to  accept
responsibility for what is happening in  South  Africa.  Escapism  is  dead.
Government cannot claim all the successes while blaming all the failures  on
apartheid. Take charge, sir! Let's be positive! We can grow by more than  4%
per annum. We can win the war against  unemployment.  The  consequences  for
our infant democracy, if we do not succeed, are too ghastly to contemplate.

The solution, I think, is to further intensify the  proposed  programmes  in
the Budget aimed at the expansion of the role of small business  enterprises
in South Africa.

Mr A BLAAS: Chairperson, although the net  adjusted  appropriation  is  only
R1,22 billion - less than 0,5% of the original Budget - there  are  concerns
that need to  be  addressed.  There  are  objections  against  some  of  the
Schedules, but  the  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill  in  general  will  be
supported by the ACDP.

The capital to current ratio declines from 20,6% to 18,6%.  This  is  caused
by a R1,4 billion reduction in fixed capital expenditure while  there  is  a
continuous upward creep in personnel expenses. This trend must  be  reversed
to ensure that job creation objectives are met.

Out of the total of R2,8 billion provided for unforeseeable and  unavoidable
expenses, R1,65 billion, approximately 60%,  is  required  by  three  Votes.
They are Vote No 34 - Water Affairs, Vote No 27 - Communications,  and  Vote
No 22 - Defence. With reference to Vote No 34, one can accept the  expenses,
barring the payment of unrecoverable debt and repayment of loans  where  the
department gave the necessary guarantees.
With reference to  Communications,  they  require  R799,7  million  for  the
postal services, programme 3, to repay money  taken  from  deposits  in  the
Postbank and used by the Post Office staff in their operations.  They  can't
pay them back and Government must see to it that they bail them out.

No account of  this  was  given  to  Parliament.  Is  such  intervention  by
Government into banking operations acceptable? From previous  experience,  I
do not think so. A full inquiry and report to Parliament is needed.

The amount given to Defence is not sufficient. The R500 million only  covers
the direct expenses for involvement in peace initiatives. Deployments  incur
additional costs relating  to  mobilisation,  mission  training,  transport,
sustenance and demobilisation. These were funded  from  existing  resources,
but all reserves are now depleted to such a level that the landward  defence
capability is in jeopardy and the success of foreign missions is at risk.

We support the peace initiatives but the necessary resources  must  be  made
available. Although the net additional appropriation  is  within  acceptable
norms, specific items such as Defence, Communication, among  others,  should
receive attention.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Deputy Chair, the MF is  concerned  that  we  have  such  a
large roll-over of R1,1 billion of unspent funds. We constantly cry that  we
do not have enough funds to save. To have such a large  roll-over  does  not
make much sense.

The MF strongly believes that the funds should be  efficiently  utilised  to
attain and ensure that our needs are met. Perhaps our hon  Finance  Minister
can assist in monitoring  certain  departments  in  spending  their  budgets
within their allocated time.

The unforeseeable or unavoidable expenditure of R4,9 billion is  understood.
No objection is raised to the salary adjustment of  R407,2 million,  nor  to
the R442,9 million for self-financing  expenditure.  It  is  hoped,  though,
that  working  rationally  with  our  Budget   the   expected   R2,5 billion
underspending may be reallocated to faculties requiring such funding.

The R2,4 billion for salary adjustment is fine. The  adjusted  appropriation
of R150 million to Communications is supported. Communications  are  crucial
to the wellbeing and development of our democracy. With  terrorism  being  a
global fear and  protection  of  our  people  a  crucial  priority,  the  MF
supports the appropriation adjustment of R500  million  to  Defence.  Social
Development is hopefully to be improved by the adjustment  of  R346  million
to Water Affairs, R180 million to Public Works and R100  million  to  Social
Development.

The MF is pleased with the new Home Affairs  setup  and  efficiency.  It  is
hoped that the R103 million adjustment will assist in this process.  The  MF
supports the  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill.  Thank  you,  Deputy  Chair.
[Applause.]

Mr  R  J  B  MOHLALA:  Deputy  Chair,  hon  Ministers  present  here  today,
colleagues, we can but learn from the turtle. The turtle is  an  animal,  an
amphibian, which is very obsessed with cleanliness. But every time it is  in
the water, it wants to get out so that it can be seen. And, when  it  starts
walking on the beach, when the sand gathers around its legs,  what  does  it
do? It turns back to the water because of its obsession with cleanliness.

This best describes how our Government and ANC Government  behaves.  An  ANC
Government is a transparent Government, which, from time to  time,  believes
in clean governance. It does everything - it budgets well and  cuts  to  the
bone. But it will realise that when it gets out of  the  water,  it  gathers
dirt, so it goes back and says, ``Let us adjust.'' [Applause.]

Now, we are here today to discuss the adjustments estimate. We talk  of  the
R103 million that has been provided to the Department of Home  Affairs.  Let
us see who benefits.  The  whole  of  South  Africa  benefited  through  the
current ID campaign in preparation for the next  general  elections,  which,
hopefully, will be good news for all the political parties present  in  this
House.

An  amount  of  R180  million  has  been  allocated  to  Public  Works   for
unanticipated rates and municipal charges owed  to  state  properties.  What
are the implications of these debts? If  Public  Works  does  not  pay,  the
landlords will evict our departments from  the  buildings  they  occupy  and
this will lead to a serious disruption in service delivery.  Surely,  we  do
not want to see that?

Allow me to deal with the next issue, which  is  the  R90  million  for  the
Department  of  Health  in  order  to  begin  implementation  of  a  broader
treatment plan for HIV/Aids. I always get suprised. When  this  turtle  gets
back into the water to clean itself, people complain. When it  gets  out  of
the water and onto the beach and gathers dirt, they still complain.

But, listen, this money is being given to the Department of  Health  because
the Government of this country, an ANC Government,  believes  in  a  healthy
society. Now, I want us to look at  this  in  that  although  the  money  is
earmarked for HIV/Aids, it is not the only  thing  that  the  Department  of
Health does. In this year only, no less than  R3  billion  is  going  to  be
spent on the health of our people. I think that is something we need  to  be
proud of.

We talk of R500 million to meet the unanticipated costs  of  the  Department
of Defence, or the SA National Defence Force, because of its United  Nations
peace mission in the DRC, participation in Burundi and so forth. But  listen
to what happens when we talk about the R500 million. They then  tell  us  of
generals. Now tell me of any army without generals  -  any  army  that  will
occupy the moral high ground and does not  have  generals.  [Interjections.]
Tell me of any army that can be called an army if it  is  not  combat-ready.
Tell me of any army that can be called an army if the  soldiers  don't  have
uniforms, don't have boots. [Interjections.]

I want to submit, therefore, that it would appear that R500 million  is  not
even enough. The Department of Defence needs  more  than  that  given  that,
among other things, in the next general elections it will be called upon  to
assist the SA Police Service in ensuring that there is peace  and  stability
during the elections, so that we have a free and  fair  election  that  will
ensure that this Government comes back with a bigger majority  than  it  has
today. [Interjections.]

I want to deal with other things. You know, later this afternoon there  will
be a number of objections and divisions  that  will  be  called  from  left,
right and centre, and all over the show. The reason  is  very  simple:  They
were here. They coudn't tell us what problems they  had  with  those  Votes.
They don't have any problem. The problem is this time of  the  year.  It  is
Eid today, and very soon it will be Christmas. People get  so  excited  when
they see adverts, Christmas trees and so forth. And, because we  are  having
elections next year, they think that if they object left, right  and  centre
and call for divisions they will get more votes. [Laughter.]

You know, I don't understand one thing: Why would you  waste  your  time  on
objections and divisions when you know very  well  that  you  are  going  to
lose?  How  can  you  enjoy   losing?   That   should   be   very   painful.
[Interjections.] I would submit that if we have  a  clear  understanding  of
what we are dealing with, in no time we can be finished with  this  and  the
House can adjourn. But, of course, they will waste  our  time,  and  we  are
ready to have our time wasted.

Allow me, in conclusion, to indicate  that  a  cockerel  ...  mokoko,  ge  o
fatafata, o fatela dithojana le matsuana, ona oja matlapa [... a man  caters
for his own family].

Now, an ANC Government ensures that the people of South Africa get the  best
life, better than a better life, and it  will  suffer  the  consequences  of
being held here for the whole afternoon. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you.  The  hon  member  who  has
just finished speaking must be the foremost authority on  animal  psychology
in the House. [Laughter.]
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I do not represent the Mutant  Ninja
Turtles this afternoon. [Laughter.] I would  like  to  express  appreciation
and perhaps just deal with some of the comments made.

The hon Woods was very expansive in his descriptions when  he  talked  about
the failures of the budgeting process.  I  would  like  to  invite  the  hon
member to look at budgets elsewhere and to  look  at  the  maturing  of  the
processes in this country. He should also recognise that, in the  course  of
the next fortnight, as I  said  earlier,  the  Treasury  will  place  before
Cabinet decisions for the fiscal year which ends on 31 March 2005  for  this
Parliament to vote on. It will also make laws about moneys. If one looks  at
the time period and the uncertainties that may arise, then  it  is  a  gross
exaggeration to talk about a failure  in  the  budgeting  process  when  the
numbers are as they are in the adjustments estimate.

Both the hon Woods and Rajbally spoke about the size of the  roll-overs.  We
are talking about 0,8% of the total expenditure.  Of  that  R1,079  billion,
the bulk is in the Treasury. Not for the Treasury,  it's  in  the  Treasury.
Virtually 80% of what the Treasury holds sits in two  parts.  This  is  well
explained in the adjustments estimates.

The first would be for allocations, transfers to  local  government  against
certain performance criteria. Conditional grants to local  governments  have
to be rolled over. They cannot be ceded and given away in violation  of  the
Division of Revenue Act. That is why they are there. When local  authorities
perform and the applications are there, the money is released. There  is  no
problem. The other large chunk of money is  for  transfers  to  Lesotho  and
Namibia in terms of the Southern Africa Customs  Union  Agreement  where  we
are holding up money to ensure that we can first reconcile the figures.

Shoot me, shoot me for not giving away money when the Act is very clear.  We
try to adhere to the letter and spirit of the law  by  ensuring  that  where
conditions are set, those conditions must first be met before the money  can
be released.

So 88% of what the National Treasury sits on will be transferred but  hasn't
been transferred because the conditions have not been met. That is the  bulk
of the R1,079 billion. It does not suggest a  failure  or  an  inability  to
plan. It suggests that the system is working and that the  PFMA  has  kicked
in, Dr Woods.

Similarly, when one deals with  performance  budgets,  it  is  important  to
again look at growth and organic  development.  What  we  published  in  the
estimates of national expenditure tabled in this House in  February  are  in
each chapter measurable objectives for departments. They are there. The  MOs
are there. They are there for the first time and they will grow from here.

We will not be able to ripen this tomato by squeezing it. One has to  ensure
that the capacities are in place and performance budgeting will come.  I  do
not think  that  we  are  far  off  the  track.  The  spirit  in  which  the
adjustments estimates  have  been  debated  here  and  the  way  that  these
discussions have taken place in the committee  largely  recognise  the  fact
that we have come a long way from where this country was.

When I became Minister of Finance, we had roll-overs of R12 billion  a  year
of a budget a third the size of what we have now. One has to  recognise  the
progress. Unless one does this, one might get into  the  mode  of  believing
that this is production planning in a factory for a  week.  It  is  not  the
same. It is  a  different  set  of  processes  and  we  must  be  alive  and
sufficiently flexible to manage change.

Let me conclude by referring to the hon Odendaal.  I  think  his  colleagues
have advised him that I would do so. Dr Odendaal, I have said  this  to  the
hon Andrew time and again. One can get up  in  this  House,  stand  at  this
podium and declare that there will be growth of 8% next year. You  will  not
be able to deliver it. Unless one has a fairly fine  understanding  of  what
the constraints are to that growth, one is going to make  mistakes.  I  have
heard the hon Odendaal's preaching three times this afternoon on  small  and
medium enterprises.

One of the key issues that is a constraint in this economy  is  that  we  do
not have sufficient  skills.  We  have  lots  of  people  who  do  not  have
sufficient skills. The reason we do not have sufficient skills is  that  the
education system in this country has  been  wrong.  The  difference  between
education and training has been binary. In that split between education  and
training, black people have been seen as  hewers  of  wood  and  drawers  of
water. One cannot get rid of this unless one  makes  a  commitment  over  at
least a generation. This is a problem we have to deal with. Unless  we  make
appropriate  interventions  in  training  and  skilling,  in   science   and
technology against the backdrop of apartheid in this country, we  will  fail
the next generation and the one after that.

We have to be realistic. It is a residue, it's a legacy, it's  what  we  are
and what shapes this economy, and it is what will act as a brake  to  growth
for a long time yet. That, coupled with living  in  parts  of  South  Africa
that were way above the means, that  saw  a  lifestyle  fuelled  largely  by
debt, ignoring the need for savings and therefore investment  capital,  will
continue to constrain growth in this country.

We have to deal with those realities, work at them and  understand  that  it
is our burden and responsibility to effect that transformation because  that
is where the burden of transformation rests. Siyabulela kakhulu. [Thank  you
very much.]

                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                    (Consideration of Votes and Schedule)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  members,  the  proceedings
will initially take the form of a question-and-answer session. I  shall  put
each Vote in turn, whereupon members  will  have  the  opportunity  to  pose
questions to the relevant Ministers.
Hon members should please wait until I recognise them before they put  their
questions.

Vote No 1 - The Presidency:

Ms M SMUTS: Chairperson, the amounts being rolled over  and  voted  upon  in
this Vote are small, but our concern about the  Presidency  is  great.  This
bureaucracy, after all, is the engine room of the ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  if  you  speak
while someone is putting a question, the Minister will not be able to  fully
apply his or her mind to what is being asked. Please, could I  call  on  you
to settle down. Order! You can now proceed, hon member.

Ms M SMUTS: The bureaucracy, that is the Presidency, is the engine  room  of
the centralisation of power in South Africa. The new funds being voted  upon
are largely for salary increases in the policy  co-ordination  and  advisory
services. We note that this directorate,  amongst  other  things,  runs  the
secretariat for all the directors-general who are  nowadays  appointed,  not
by their Ministers, but by the President.

Among the key projects that it has undertaken is  the  ten-year  review.  In
fact, the R1 million rolled over also went to this  project,  which  the  DA
has  found  to  be  an  exaggeration   of   Government   successes   and   a
misrepresentation of failures such as the control of crime. In short,  crime
statistics were sexed up while the Gini coefficient was sexed down.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, could I address you on  a
point of order? Basically, I think, it's a procedural question. You gave  us
a guide that  this  is  a  question-and-answer  session  which,  in  effect,
actually means that, distinctly, it is not the time  for  statements  to  be
made. Rather, it is the time for questions to be posed and responses  to  be
solicited. So, we would like your direction  in  regard  to  that  question.
Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Chief Whip.  The  first
point I want to make is that it is  indeed  a  question-and-answer  session.
The second point is that it is not limited to merely asking a question.  The
member is entitled to make a statement. But, I  would  like  to  advise  you
that if you are going to make your statement extra long, it is going  to  be
difficult for the Minister to be able to give you an answer  that  is  going
to cover the extent of the question. Therefore, I would like to  advise  you
to try to be terse and brief.

Ms M SMUTS: With pleasure, Chair. With  respect,  Sir,  I'm  not  sure  that
there is someone in the House to answer the question.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: I am available.

Ms M SMUTS: Oh, the Minister of Finance is available. Thank you  very  much.
Our objection is against the sexing up of ...

Prof B TUROK: Chairperson, there is a problem with sound.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, could you please  move  to
another microphone. [Interjections.] Order! Let's  try  this  one.  Proceed,
hon member.

Ms M SMUTS: I am delighted that the hon Minister of Finance is available  to
answer the question. I didn't see the Minister in The Presidency.

Our objection is against all the sexing up  and  sexing  down,  specifically
the sexing up of salaries. And, since you require a question, sir, we  would
like to know who these  increased  salaries  are  for.  How  large  a  staff
component does this directorate have and what skills do the staff have?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, are you  rising  on
a point of order?

Prof B TUROK: The point of order is that we cannot  understand  how  a  Vote
has anything to do with sex. I  would  like  the  hon  member  to  withdraw.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think the context in  which  it  was
put is clearly understood. The hon Minister of Finance is on  his  feet  and
ready to answer.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: I think the hon Smuts may actually have  a  problem
with sex rather than the appropriations. [Laughter.]  That's  not  something
that we can resolve by question-and-answer here; it  needs  a  couch  and  a
psychiatrist.

Back on  the  subject:  What  you  will  find  as  a  thread  through  every
adjustment is that the settlement in the wage bargaining was initially  done
on a three-year agreement. But, because it  was  premised  on  inflation  in
May, the adjustments in the salaries were higher than we had  budgeted  for.
So, regarding the R224 000 in the Policy Co-ordination Services and the  R20
000 in the Cabinet Office, basically the  increases  are  explained  by  the
higher than budgeted amounts for settlement. You will find that on each  and
every Vote, and I would ask the hon Smuts to accept it in that spirit.  It's
not something peculiar to The Presidency. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Minister. I  just  want
to advise hon members: I think you are  aware  that  all  political  parties
were allocated a specific amount of time and  that  the  Table  is  actually
recording by the second the time  you  are  using.  So,  once  you  go  into
lengthy speeches, you are going to be merely using  up  the  time  that  has
been allocated to you. So, you will need to use your time most efficiently.

I now put Vote No 2 - Parliament. Are there any questions?

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Chairperson, on a point of order: Aren't  we  first  going
to vote on The Presidency? [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  No,  I'm  going  to  take  them  ...
[Interjections.]

Mr I J PRETORIUS: I was told beforehand that that would  be  the  procedure.
I'm just making sure.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will take them out seriatim, and  we
will put the Vote at the end.

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs:

Prince N E ZULU: Thank you,  Deputy  Chair.  There  are  free  photos,  free
mobile units, free volunteers all relating to the ID campaign,  and  on  top
of that there is a R30 million allocation from Treasury. I believe  this  is
a commendable step forward, especially in terms of the ID campaign. Thanks.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you. I think the hon member  has
made a statement.

Vote No 6 - Public Works:

Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Mr Deputy  Chair.  Mr  Minister  of  Provincial  and
Local Government, some time ago the Deputy  Minister  indicated  that  there
were  concerns  around  the  efficiency  and  efficacy   of   cross-boundary
municipalities, such as the one we have  in  Tshwane.  Also,  the  portfolio
committee, during its recent visit some time ago, expressed concern  in  its
report.

Now, there is a possibility that we might  change  this  model,  because  it
doesn't work as efficiently as  it  could  owing  to  the  intergovernmental
grants that come from different provinces. Is there money allocated in  this
budget to do some research  and  investigation  into  the  model  of  cross-
boundary municipalities with the option of changing it?

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Yes. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Yes, the  Minister's  very  short  and
pithy reply.

Vote No 8 - National Treasury:

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Agb Voorsitter, die agb Minister het  vroeër  vanmiddag  op
verklarings gereageer en veral op die verklaring van die leier van die  ACDP
oor die ou HOP-fonds wat deur sy  departement  geadministreer  word  en  wat
eintlik maar net dien as 'n transmissierekening vir skenkings  wat  uit  die
buiteland ontvang word. Daar is volgens koerantberigte meer  as  'n  miljard
rand in die fonds. Ek het in die aansuiweringsbegroting gekyk of ek sien  of
enige van daardie geld uit daardie fonds aangewend is in die  programme  wat
aangedui is ten opsigte van werkskeppingsprogramme. My vraag  is:  Gaan  van
daardie fonds se geld nou  beskikbaar  gestel  word  vir  programme  in  die
aansuiweringsbegroting of dalk eers iewers in die toekoms?  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Chairperson, the hon Minister responded to  statements
earlier this afternoon and especially to the statement of the leader of  the
ACDP about the former RDP fund which is administered by his  department  and
which actually  merely  serves  as  a  transmission  account  for  donations
received from abroad. According to newspaper reports there is more  than  R1
billion in the fund. I have looked in the adjustments appropriation  to  see
whether any of that money in that fund has been utilised in  the  programmes
indicated in respect of job creation programmes. My question is: Will  money
from that fund now be made  available  for  programmes  in  the  adjustments
appropriations or possibly only some time in the future?]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, because the RDP fund is,  as  the  hon
Odendaal correctly points out, but  a  transmission  mechanism,  it  is  not
appropriated as part of the adjustments estimate. It's part of  our  general
accounting, but not part of the Treasury Vote for the adjustments  estimate.
We don't have the power to appropriate those resources. In every case, as  I
pointed out in response  to  the  hon  Meshoe  earlier,  there  would  be  a
contract between a recipient - be it a department  at  national,  provincial
or even local government level - and the donor, largely the European  Union.
Those contracts would actually set the performance criteria to  be  met  for
the release of those funds, so it  wouldn't  be  recorded  as  part  of  the
Adjustments Appropriation Bill. Thank you.
Vote No 16 - Health:

Ms C DUDLEY: Hon Minister, the ACDP welcomes the fact  that  R90 million  is
now available  for  the  roll-out  of  antiretroviral  treatment.  Has  this
injection of funding eradicated the Minister's previous  concerns  regarding
lack of capacity? What makes this a better time to  invest  the  R90 million
in antiretroviral treatment than a year ago,  say,  or  two  or  even  three
years ago? What has changed, and why now?

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, somebody said it's the best  time.  Let
me correct the hon member. This allocation is for  comprehensive  management
and treatment of HIV/Aids. So if one could capture it correctly, I think  we
would then understand if this money was enough or not. Let me also say  that
we had requested, indeed, a little bit more money, but this is what we  got.


Let me say upfront that we had to transfer the sum  of  R20 million  to  the
National Health Laboratory Service. This is an indication,  indeed,  of  the
inadequacies of  our  laboratory  services,  services  that  are  absolutely
critical for monitoring patients. You need your CD4 count, your viral  load,
of course you need the testing for  haematology  and  microbology,  and  for
general  chemistry.  This  is  partly  the  infrastructure  we   have   been
expressing and continue to express our concerns about.

The issue of HR is also going to be a great challenge to us.  The  upgrading
and harmonising  of  our  national  health  patient  information  system  is
another very big challenge. Research, including  research  into  traditional
medicines, is another area we want to engage in very robustly.

Another challenge is going to be the  procurement  of  medicines.  Patients,
obviously, move from one combination, or  one  regimen,  to  the  next  very
quickly. They develop resistance, particularly if there  is  poor  adherence
and compliance with the medicine. Therefore, this is going to be a very  big
challenge.

We also need, of course,  to  improve  the  upgrading  of  the  distribution
system of the medicines. There are a lot  of  activities  that  need  to  be
done. There is the accreditation  of  our  service  points  -  one  in  each
district. We can only hope that this money will be a kick-start  for  us  to
undertake all those activities. Thank you.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Deputy Chair, the IFP commends the hon  Ministers  for  the
allocation of R12 billion over three  years  for  HIV/Aids  programmes,  and
especially  for  channelling  60%  to   the   provincial   equitable   share
allocation.  We  are  certain  that  the  IFP's  determination  to   provide
antiretrovirals in KwaZulu-Natal and to  challenge  the  ANC's  no-treatment
policy in court played an important role in Government's  change  of  heart.
If elections were the final spur, well and good for millions  with  HIV  and
for the country at large.

However, as the Minister pointed out, budgeted  funds  are  not  sufficient.
Capacity must be built locally and provincially  to  have  the  full  amount
accountably spent. The blame should not fall on  provinces  for  failing  to
spend their full allocation for HIV, because, while we follow  contradictory
policies with money and accountability going down  to  provinces  and  local
government and authority going up to national Government, we  will  struggle
to reach our goals.

Some  provinces  have  already  started  to  implement   the   task   team's
recommended plan of action. Political delaying tactics have held them  back.
Where, for example, is the Global Fund's  gift  to  KwaZulu-Natal,  Lovelife
and national Government? Why do  we  not  see  it  in  hard  cash  and  real
programmes? Only the Minister of Health and the Minister of  Finance's  lack
of will can be blamed for this unforgivable delay.

My questions to the Ministers are: Where exactly is the Global  Fund  money?
Has it been received and  is  it  being  rolled  out?  How  will  they  make
provision for the increased need for antiretroviral programmes,  because  it
appeared that the budgeted amount was sufficient only for 2004-05, not 2005-
06 and  2006-07?  And,  how  will  they  cater  for  the  need  for  greater
decentralisation and  a  simpler,  clearer  relationship  between  national,
provincial and local governments?

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Chairperson, there are so many questions. I  hope  I
will be able to remember all of them in order to answer  them.  Let  me  say
that two months ago I  signed  the  agreement  with  the  Global  Fund.  The
resources have not been transferred. So, I think, we have  played  our  part
in the sense that I  actually  signed  the  agreement.  I  also  signed  the
agreement with a project in KwaZulu-Natal with regard to the management  and
control of malaria. So those agreements have been signed.

The other question  that  you  raised  is  that  we  should  not  blame  the
provinces if they do not perform. I wish the  members  of  Parliament  would
also assist us in this regard - visit your departments of  health,  interact
with the MECs, interact with the HODs,  and,  if  they  have  any  problems,
bring them to us as well. We do interact with them, and we  try  to  support
each other so that these funds are spent.

Of course, there is an arrangement in which we work very  closely  with  the
provinces and also with local government, and this is in the  normal  course
of events and not specific to the management and  treatment  of  those  with
HIV/Aids. I don't know whether I have answered all your questions.  I  think
there is one that I didn't address, Chairperson.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Can I follow up with the question, Deputy  Chair?  It  was,
hon Minister ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think, just the  question  that  has
not been answered, hon member, but in very, very few words.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Okay, Deputy Chair. The question was about  the  allocation
being sufficient for roll-out next year, but  not  sufficient  for  roll-out
the next two years. Does that make it an election strategy?

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: I am sure the hon member has  not  read  the  Budget
correctly. May I ask her to go and consult the Internet? She will find  that
moneys  have  been  made  available.  However,  we  will,  of   course,   be
interacting with the Treasury if we run short.

Vote No 19 - Social Development:

Ms C DUDLEY: Hon Minister, the ACDP welcomes  the  R100  million  which  has
been made available for child grants. We are concerned, however, that  these
grants will be vulnerable as gambling and liquor are  tempting  options  for
desperate people. What controls are in place to ensure that  money  is  used
to put food in hungry children's mouths, and has Government considered  food
stamps, which would prevent spending  on  alcohol,  lotteries  and  casinos?
Thank you.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairperson, not  yet.  We  have  not
yet  considered  that.  We  are  thinking  about  that,  but   this   is   a
constitutional state. We cannot really be expected to tell  people  what  to
do with their money. I personally, and I think the Government  as  a  whole,
have been a little worried about the way in which the grants have been  used
by quite a number of people; not only those intended  for  children  either,
but also the mothers themselves. The way they use that money is not what  it
is meant for. We would like to think  with  you  and  try  to  resolve  that
matter in a friendlier way than is possible at the moment.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Mr Deputy  Chairperson,  the  Government  has  spent
R1,142 billion  on  backpay  to  approximately  1 600 000  beneficiaries  of
social grants over the past couple of years. Provision  has  been  made  for
R2,667 million to be rolled over in order to administer this  situation.  My
question is, will the National Social Security  Agency  possibly  take  this
role over in future, and will we then have a saving in this regard?

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Mr Chairperson, we hope to  be  able  to
do that, but quite obviously, it's not as  easy  as  it  seems,  because  it
takes very long for some of the people to realise that they are entitled  to
this, and the hon member would be very helpful if he could  go  out  in  his
own constituency and tell people that they are entitled to this money.

Vote No 21 - Correctional Services:

Mr J DURAND: Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairperson.  Minister,  we  were  shocked
last week by information of the young boy Jabu who was raped  and  sodomised
in prison, and who is now HIV-positive. Are there sufficient funds  in  this
budget that will ensure the safety of  juveniles  in  prison  so  that  they
don't get mixed up with hardened criminals?

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you, Chairperson, and  the  hon
member for that question. I think one does sympathise with  situations  such
as those in which young people are raped and sodomised  in  our  facilities,
inasmuch as I think we should if members of the general public  -  children,
young people and women - are raped and assaulted.  Our  sympathy  should  go
both ways.

But let me say that we have about 242  prisons  in  this  country,  a  staff
complement  of  about  34 000  people  and   180 000   prisoners   who   are
incarcerated, including approximately 55 000  awaiting-trial  prisoners.  We
have about 70 000 on parole and probation. Some may be your  neighbours  and
you wouldn't know that. About 60% of our prison population  is  between  the
ages of 18 and 35,  which  means  we  have  a  lot  of  younger  people  and
juveniles in our prisons.

Yes, we  have  budgeted  adequately.  We  have  about  13  juvenile  centres
throughout the country, but we have found that this number of  young  people
is quite overwhelming in our prisons, and at the moment we are  also  trying
to renovate the old prisons which were built many, many  years  ago  to  try
and accommodate young people there.

The four prisons that we are also proposing as  the  new-generation  prisons
have been designed more to cater for the young people whom we  cannot  cater
for in other places. I must say, however, that, owing to  the  lack  of  co-
operation and co-ordination at some point at the facility level between  the
various components of the criminal justice system, we find  that  there  are
children who slip through the net and end up in prisons,  and  then  end  up
being assaulted or sodomised.

I think these are the issues that we need to deal with  in  a  comprehensive
manner with other components of the criminal justice  system  and  not  only
Correctional Services.

Mr S N SWART: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister, we  are  all  aware  of  the
severe overcrowding in many of  our  prisons,  highlighted  particularly  by
Judge Fagan of the Inspectorate of  Prisons.  Whilst  the  prisons  are  the
recipients  of  a  criminal  justice  system  under  pressure,  and  certain
initiatives have been taken to  reduce  overcrowding,  particularly  amongst
awaiting-trial prisoners, would you explain to the House why the  amount  of
R200 million will  not  be  spent  during  the  current  financial  year  on
programme 5: Facility Management and Capital  Works,  ie  building  prisons,
and why delays have taken  place  during  the  planning  stages  of  capital
projects? Surely the building of further prisons would have  alleviated  the
overcrowding problem? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF  CORRECTIONAL  SERVICES:  Well,  I  think  a  week  ago  the
Minister of Finance did mention that the R200  million  which  was  budgeted
for more facilities  could  not  be  spent  this  year,  simply  because  as
Correctional Services we're not establishing facilities alone;  we  do  have
advice from Treasury. We also rely on Public Works. We do  budget,  however,
for facilities, but we do not build facilities. It  is  Public  Works  which
builds facilities. It is Treasury which also advises Correctional Services.

Vote No 22 - Defence:

Mr R JANKIELSOHN: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. The Department  of  Defence
approached  Parliament  with  a  request  for  funding   to   redesign   and
restructure the SA National Defence Force.  This  is  necessary,  since  our
troops are old and equipment is  becoming  unserviceable  and  obsolete.  We
need to bring younger men and women into the SANDF and re-equip our army.

The SANDF will not be able to play a meaningful role  in  South  Africa,  or
Africa, if this  is  not  done.  More  money  allocated  for  peace  support
operations and the appointment of more senior  staff  will  not  assist  the
SANDF's attempts to sustain itself or improve mission readiness.  The  SANDF
is already experiencing capacity and logistical problems  with  its  current
deployments abroad.

Minister, when is Government going to prioritise spending in the  Department
of Defence to allow the SANDF to restructure and redesign itself so that  it
can become a modern, young, professional and sustainable force?

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, there were certain constraints to  the
exit strategy for people from the Defence Force. One of  these  was  in  the
pension system; the reason  why  there  are  footsoldiers,  if  you  wish  -
corporals and below - in the infantry who are 35 and above.
Mr I J PRETORIUS: And generals!

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Generals' ages are less of an issue, Sakkie.  We'll
teach you about the army sometime!

But the reason why we've had this difficulty is that the pension system  had
been unfavourable to people who were integrated just recently.  Hon  members
may be aware of the fact that there was an amendment approved by this  House
about a month ago to  the  Government  Employees  Pension  Fund  legislation
which would allow for some adjustment and  substantial  improvement  to  the
pension benefits of soldiers, and this would facilitate the exit  of  people
who are overage.

Similarly, there are a number of brass in the army who should in fact  exit,
not because they're part of the fighting corps, but  because  their  age  is
prohibitive. This has  resulted  in  a  situation  where  it's  a  top-heavy
structure at the moment.  But  there  too,  I  think  a  number  of  people,
primarily those who come from  the  former  nonstatutory  forces,  could  be
released because of the changes now approved in the pension system.

So the SA National Defence Force  advises  that  this  will  facilitate  the
movement of people out and  equip  the  Defence  Force  to  recruit  younger
people and therefore improve its "paraatheid", as Sakkie would like to  hear
us say. Thank you.

Vote No 24 - Justice and Constitutional Development:

Ms C B JOHNSON: Deputy Chair, Mr Minister, this  morning  certain  NGOs  and
women's rights organisations went on  record  in  the  press  and  they  are
alleging that the Department of Justice and  Constitutional  Development  is
spending more money on the Hefer Commission than it is  to  combat  violence
against women and children. If one looks at the  adjustments  appropriation,
there is an amount of R1,7 million that has been  used  as  a  roll-over  to
fund the 16  Days  of  Activism.  Could  the  Minister  kindly  clarify  the
situation?

The MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,  the
comparison is not a proper one. In order  to  understand  how  much  we  are
spending on vulnerable  groups,  we  have  to  examine  the  Budget  in  its
entirety. For instance, in the current  financial  year  we  have  allocated
R50,6 million to address the needs of vulnerable groups in the legal  system
in programme 2. So in that context, you will  immediately  realise  that  we
are spending more money on vulnerable groups, including women and  children,
than whatever amount you think we are spending on the Hefer Commission.

Vote No 25 - Safety and Security:

Adv P S SWART: Deputy Chair, the whole Portfolio  Committee  on  Safety  and
Security, and presumably all members here as well as  everybody  out  there,
are agreed that police officers, in  particular  those  below  the  rank  of
director, are seriously underpaid. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order please! Order!
Adv P S SWART: They are the people who are understaffed every day and  don't
have the resources, but literally put their lives on the line  to  do  their
task. There is often a direct and negative consequence to this, namely  that
morale in the SAPS is far from  what  it  should  be,  and  that  some  less
scrupulous members unfortunately become susceptible to corruption. This,  in
turn, causes serious damage to the image  of  our  police  and  much  needed
resources have to be redirected to investigate this corruption.

Every year we  hear  promises  of  improved  remuneration,  but  apart  from
inflation-related increases, nothing happens.  The  appropriation  for  this
Vote is for just such increases. Hon Minister, at what stage will we  budget
to financially empower our police officers? Whilst we  can  never  pay  them
what they are worth, it is a shame that some  don't  even  earn  a  liveable
income.

The MINISTER OF  SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Thank  you  very  much.  Well,  the
question that is being posed, if related to what we are dealing  with,  goes
an extra mile because it is looking at the overall salary  packages  of  our
police officials. It is true that we do want to pay our police officials  at
least salaries which we can also be proud of. There are  circumstances,  and
the member is aware of the circumstances that we are dealing with in  regard
to this matter. It is our desire that they should have adequate salaries.

That question, as I say, fits into other processes which are not related  to
today. Today we are looking at the  amount  of  R83 million  that  has  been
appropriated for purposes of ensuring that we respond to  amounts  that  the
police ought to have received in the past, which they did not. That  is  the
question. Thank you very much.

Mr J SCHIPPERS: Hon Minister, the total additional appropriation for  Safety
and Security, as you mentioned,  is  R83,46  million.  According  to  salary
adjustments, the total amount has been allocated to the department to  cover
the  costs  of  the  higher-than-expected  salary  increases.  Yet,  in  the
standard item specification on page 118 of  the  document,  four  items  are
listed, of which R28,86 million is allocated to equipment.  My  question  to
you, Mr Minister, is: Can you clarify that? Secondly, why was no  allocation
made towards programme 4, that is, detective services? Thank you.

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Firstly, I would like to refer the  hon
member to the overall budgeting for this department, but also to ask him  to
actually refer back to the year 1999 and look at how this particular item  -
detective services - was handled. You will see, for instance,  if  you  take
the years 1999 to the last financial year, that  we  have  had  an  increase
which accounts for 9,8%. But if you look at the  next  financial  year,  you
will see that this has dropped to 8%.

The  reason  for  that  is  the  fact  that  we  have  restructured  in  the
department, and the consequence of that has been  for  us  to  reprioritise.
But, if you look at those amounts you will see that the  highest  allocation
goes to crime prevention and  that  the  second  highest,  indeed,  goes  to
detective services. I am not talking  about  administration,  I  am  talking
about functional programmes, because we are paying a  lot  of  attention  to
this. Now, if you look at general investigations, you  will  see  that  they
account, in terms of the detective  services,  for  more  than  50%  of  the
allocation within that particular area.

Of course we are also seeing an increase - and this is one of  a  few  items
where there is an increase - in regard to the units that  relate  to  family
violence, child protection, and sexual offences. So, if  you  look  at  this
overall, you will see that there has been a  necessity  for  the  particular
item, detective services, in the first  instance,  to  move  in  a  straight
line. And then, it is now tipping as a result of the  reasons  that  I  have
already indicated.

The issue of equipment is an important one for us. There are new items  that
we have  acquired,  which  have  accounted  for  the  R28 million  you  have
referred to. Thank you very much.

Vote No 26 - Agriculture:

Mr M V NGEMA: Thank you, Deputy Chair. Minister, the IFP  notes  that  there
have been huge savings in programmes 7 to 9, which have been  redirected  to
fund other activities within the department, something  we  appreciate.  But
the volume of savings would indicate that  the  department  either  bit  off
more than it could chew,  or  that  the  funds  were  not  used  because  of
operational problems. Most of these  savings  are  on  vacancies  not  being
filled and new appointments not being made when the money was allocated  for
these very purposes. What really necessitated these posts not  being  filled
and appointments not being made?

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Thank  you  very  much,  hon
member. As you rightly said, the  issue  is  more  the  personnel  vacancies
which have not been filled or new appointments which  have  not  been  made.
The majority of those posts in various programmes were affected by the  fact
that we needed to comply with our restructuring of the department,  but,  at
the same time, take into consideration certain measures  that  were  put  in
place in terms of Resolution 7. Clearly, what has  happened  is  that  after
the conclusion  of  the  process,  some  of  the  advertisements  went  out.
Obviously, some of those resources have not yet been expended. Thank you.

Vote No 27 - Communications:

Mr L M GREEN: Chair, could the Minister explain how it is possible  for  the
Postbank to  mismanage  R750  million  belonging  to  depositors,  and  what
regulations are in place to ensure that this kind of mismanagement does  not
happen again? Does the Minister know of any other bank in South Africa  that
has mismanaged depository funds to the same extent?

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. If  Mr  Green
had followed what  was  happening  with  the  Post  Office,  he  would  have
realised that the problem is one that started with  the  corporatisation  of
the Post Office in 1991 - long before this Government came into  power.  The
way the Post Office worked was that it used moneys  interchangeably  between
the Postbank and the Post Office. It was when we  discovered  this  in  2001
that we put a stop to it; and, because of the  other  commitments  that  the
Post Office also had regarding the pension and  medical  aid  deficits  that
existed, it was important then that we looked at  how,  in  fact,  we  could
overcome this.

So two things were done: firstly, to look  at  exactly  what  those  amounts
were; and, secondly, to make sure that that deficit would not  be  increased
by creating a firewall so  that  the  exchanges  that  used  to  take  place
between the Postbank and the Post Office  no  longer  continued.  Therefore,
with the granting of this money, we have made  sure  that  the  Post  Office
will not be able to access Postbank money. Also, you will remember  that  we
removed the subsidy for the Post Office because we were told at the  time  -
I think it was in 2000 - that the Post Office had a  R207  million  surplus,
which was actually not a surplus. Now, we have reintroduced the  R3  million
subsidy.

What has since happened is that the Post Office is running much  better.  It
has been able to repay about R200 million of that R970 million, and that  is
why the Minister was then able to allocate R750 million to the Post  Office.
This was, indeed, because we are now confident  that  the  business  of  the
Post Office is running much better. Thank you.

Mr V C GORE: Thank you, Deputy Chair. The DA cannot  and  will  not  support
the DOC's Adjustments Appropriation Bill for one  simple  reason:  the  R750
million earmarked for the recapitalisation of the Post Office is money  that
is being used to bail out a loss-making parastatal, after  the  Post  Office
unethically and immorally took money from the poorest of the  poor  to  hide
its loss-making operations from the South African public. It was only  after
the DA uncovered the scam, Madam Minister, not  the  Government,  of  cross-
subsidising loss-making  operations  from  poor  depositors'  money  at  the
Postbank that the accounting books of the two entities were separated.

Now that the Post Office cannot get its money from the poor, it  is  turning
to the taxpayer. The R750  million  is  in  addition  to  the  R1,2  billion
subsidy over the next four years. Madam Minister, my questions to  you  are:
When are the cross-subsidisation, the grants and  the  subsidies,  going  to
end? When is the Post Office going to be turned around and become  an  asset
to this country rather than a liability?

The MINISTER OF COMMUNICATIONS: Chairperson,  I'm  not  so  sure  where  the
member got the information that the DA uncovered this.  This  was  uncovered
through hard work done by  the  department  and  the  Treasury.  Simply  not
having heard us talk about it, doesn't mean you uncovered it; we did.

Secondly, the issue of the Post Office, as you will also know, is  that  the
Post Office services were not, in fact, enjoyed by  the  majority  of  South
Africans. The subsidy was introduced  especially  because  the  Post  Office
itself was suffering losses  because  of  the  new  technologies  that  were
developing - people were no longer sending messages by postcard  or  through
letters. That technology had encroached on the Post  Office.  However,  what
we have done is to reinvent the Post Office in the work that  it  does,  for
example by the extension of citizen post offices -  PITs  -  in  many  rural
areas so that these new technologies can actually begin to service the  very
disadvantaged people  that  had  never,  in  fact,  been  properly  serviced
before.

If you are saying we should not make that  subsidy  availiable,  that  means
you want to take away that subsidy from the poorest of the poor  about  whom
you were talking. What we are  doing  as  this  Government  is  to  make  it
possible for you to go anywhere - to small places like Kuruman  for  example
- and find some of those PITs, which  had  never  existed  before  in  these
areas. These PITS are giving ordinary people access to e-mail, to faxes,  to
scanners and to computers - something that  this  Government  had  committed
itself to  in  terms  of  ordinary  people  being  brought  into  the  world
information society that we want. That is  what  we  pay  the  subsidy  for.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Vote No 28 - Environmental Affairs and Tourism:

Mrs A VAN WYK:  Chair,  as  a  recognised  driver  in  a  successful  modern
economy, it could be argued that  South  Africa's  scientific  research  and
technological development are chronically underfunded. And now that  the  SA
National Antarctic Programme will be transferred - without personnel -  from
the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism  to  the  Department  of
Arts, Culture, Science and Technology at  the  beginning  of  October,  what
will the budgeted amount in their allocation be used for and how  will  that
help the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Thank  you,  hon
member. Regarding this programme, we  are  only  transferring  the  research
part of it; the rest of it will remain our responsibility.  So  it  is  only
the research part that will go to the Department of Arts,  Culture,  Science
and Technology  where  the  right  amount  of  money  or  finances  will  be
determined by our sitting down to see how we can assist. We feel that it  is
not worthwhile for it to be  with  us,  because  what  is  taking  place  in
practice is research work, which is not our work, on  issues  of  technology
and other issues. So that is why it is going there.

Vote No 30 - Land Affairs:

Mr M V NGEMA: Deputy  Chair,  Minister,  the  IFP  notes  with  regret  that
whereas land restitution restricted indigenous  communities  to  claiming  a
small portion of their dispossessed land - not earlier than June 1913 -  the
National Treasury could not find R13 945 million to  enable  the  department
to meet its anticipated expenditure of R213 294 million on land reform.

The DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Hon  Minister,  did  you  get  the
question?

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Hon Deputy  Chair,  it  would
help if the member could repeat the question. I didn't hear the question,  I
heard a statement.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  member,  very  pithily,  what  is
your question?

Mr M V NGEMA: Chairperson, it is not a question,  it  is  an  expression  of
regret by the IFP that Treasury could not give the department the  funds  it
requested and, therefore, decided to cut down on the  money  the  department
requested for land reform.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, if I heard the question - perhaps  the
hon member could assist - he said it's a  pity  we  couldn't  find  R13  000
million or R13 billion. We  couldn't  find  it  lying  around  anywhere,  we
looked. And, if we continue to look for the R13 billion, it's not  going  to
be found. So, I do plead with the hon member to be more  realistic  in  what
he asks for. Thank you.

Vote No 32 - Trade and Industry:

Dr R T RHODA: Chairperson, SMMEs, particularly those owned and  operated  by
black entrepreneurs, should by  now  have  been  an  integral  part  of  our
national economy. This is not the case. Microcredit for productive  purposes
and general access to finance remain a major impediment. Khula and  Ntsika's
impact has been disappointing. Is it the intention of the  DTI  to  urgently
review Government's strategy as applied to small  business?  Minister,  have
you specifically budgeted to intensify efforts to assist  small  businesses,
especially in the light  of  the  recent  adoption  of  the  National  Small
Business Amendment Bill in this House? I thank you.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, the hon  member  is  making
an assumption that the impact has been limited; I think he is wrong. If  you
look at the reports from the DTI call centre, we register between 1 000  and
3 000 close corporations  per  week,  and  most  of  those  are  black-owned
corporations. So there has been a very marked increase  in  registration  of
small enterprises and, as far as it is possible for us to ascertain, a  very
sharp increase in those enterprises owned by black persons.

So  I  think  your  starting  point  is  inaccurate.  If  you  look  at  the
adjustments appropriation, you will see specifically that, to support  black
economic empowerment in this financial year and to support  the  procurement
process, we did the virement of  R50  million  towards  the  black  business
procurement supplier programme. So I am confident that  we  have  sufficient
funds. If you take a close look at the budget you will see too that we  made
certain adjustments to further support the small business programme. As  you
are aware, we did present to the  portfolio  committee  a  revised  business
strategy programme, and  we  are  also  moving  towards  the  microfinancing
project as well. So I think there is a great deal of activity on  small  and
medium business in this budget.

Mr C M LOWE: Deputy Chairman, the Department of Trade  and  Industry  should
be the key instrument for Government to shape the economy. It should be  the
driving force with a bold vision and a radical plan to lead the economy  and
stimulate growth to create jobs in order to ensure a  better  life  for  all
South Africans in an expanding economy. Instead, after nearly  10  years  of
ANC incorporated, over one million jobs have been  lost  and  eight  million
South Africans are now unemployed.

Minister, surely, introducing real  broad-based  economic  empowerment  from
the bottom up, thereby reaching those people who  need  it  most  first,  is
better than Government's top-down racially  based  system  which  opens  the
door to making an elite, well-connected and wealthy  few  even  richer,  and
leaves ordinary South Africans just as marginalised  and  excluded  as  ever
they were. Surely, the most empowering thing of  all  is  a  job  and  until
South Africans everywhere realise this, we will all pay the  price  and  the
jobless queues will only get longer. Thank you.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, well, as  the  Minister  of
Finance said, this is not an  election  Budget.  But  I  can  see  that  the
questions are the usual election nonsense. [Interjections.] The position  is
very clear: If  the  hon  member  and  the  DA  would  look  at  the  census
statistics and the labour force surveys, they would see that in  the  period
1996-2001 we created more than 1,5 million  jobs  -  net  new  jobs  in  the
formal sector. So this clichéd loss of a million jobs that keeps  coming  up
is inaccurate and wrong.

If you were also to look at the  census  you  would  see  that  there  is  a
challenge which the Government and the President have  quite  clearly  taken
on, ie the participation ratio in this economy has  dramatically  increased;
women, in particular, are coming  into  the  labour  market;  and  also  the
effects of higher population growth rates one and two  generations  ago.  We
have achieved a much higher participation ratio and  we  have  created  more
jobs. As the President outlined,  we  discussed  the  concept  of  a  second
economy, and this Government has put  massive  resources  behind  addressing
that second economy through rural development,  urban  development  and  now
through the extended Public Works programmes.

So, I think we should  stop  the  clichés.  I  am  very  confident  that  my
department has provided leadership and guidance in  this  economy  and  will
continue to do so because the  ANC  will  be  the  government  in  the  next
Parliament.

There was no debate.

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (First Reading debate)

Ms B A HOGAN: Mr Chair,  I'm  advised  that  there  were  certain  technical
printing errors in the Bill as it was published, and I have agreed that  the
amendments be read into the record.

These amendments are: That, on page 11, line 27, ``(1)'' be inserted  before
``Section 3''; on page 11, after line 57, the following be  inserted,  ``(2)
Subsection (1)(c) shall in so far as it deletes the  reference  to  sections
9E and 9F come into operation on 1 June 2004 and shall apply in  respect  of
years of assessment commencing on or after that date''; on page 18, in  line
54, the word ``controlled'' be deleted; on page 32, in line  25,  the  words
"commits to be objective  in  processing"  be  omitted  and  substituted  by
``commits to the objective of processing''; on page 84, in line  47,  ``this
Act'' should read ``that Act''; on  page  97,  in  line  19,  ``by  notice''
should read ``by proclamation''; on page 115, lines 1  and  2  should  read:
``(g) by the substitution in subparagraph  (h)  of  paragraph  (3)  for  the
words preceding item (i) of the following words'';  and,  on  page  135,  in
line 51, ``for the words preceding paragraph (a) of the  following  words''.
be added after "Income Tax Act", 1962: Those are the amendments  to  correct
some of the printing errors.

This Bill is an omnibus  Bill  that  amends  numerous  matters  relating  to
different aspects of our taxation law. Some of it  is  so  complex  that  no
right-thinking person should ever be allowed  to  present  matters  of  such
complexity to Parliament. I would say that it took the committee  some  time
to even begin to understand what we are dealing with. I  refer  particularly
to corporate restructuring rules which, as time goes on,  we  are  amending,
and which arise out of the earlier taxation reforms  that  were  introduced.
Specifically with corporate restructuring rules,  there  are  anti-avoidance
measures that are  being  introduced  plus  matters  relating  to  financial
instrument-holding companies and a number of other matters.

One of the issues that attracted a lot of debate and a  lot  of  comment  in
this Revenues Laws Amendment Bill was the reporting requirements  now  being
imposed on financial institutions, which will impact mainly on  the  banking
industry. It relates to matters where  special  reporting  rules  have  been
introduced  for  transactions  that  contain  indicators  of  potential  tax
avoidance. So if you are a bank and you are  engaged,  for  instance,  in  a
very sophisticated agreement with a client and  that  agreement  means  that
there might be instances in which these arrangements contain  a  tax  rebate
clause, you will now be obliged to report on this beforehand.

The Minister is granted the  power  to  identify  some  of  these  reporting
taxation agreements arrangements in terms of the Gazette but this has to  be
tabled in Parliament within 12 months.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, please take your seats.

Ms B A HOGAN: Failure to report these  transactions  will  result  in  quite
stiff penalties. My colleagues will speak on a range of other  matters  that
came before us. But, there are certain issues which  I  think  are  of  use.
Firstly, this Bill clarifies the VAT treatment  of  grants  paid  by  public
authorities and local authorities. So if Government gives  grants,  what  is
the VAT status  of  those  grants?  It  also  clarifies  when  national  and
provincial departments too, with the grants  given,  will  act  outside  the
scope  of  VAT  activities.  Constitutional  institutions,   likewise,   are
excluded from the definition of enterprise.

Schedule 2 deals with major  public  entities.  However,  entities  such  as
Eskom  and  Transnet  etc  will  be  included  within  the   definition   of
enterprise. National and provincial public  entities  also  have  their  VAT
status clarified. Importantly, the VAT treatment of  vendors  in  industrial
development zones and customs-controlled areas will  be  treated  as  though
one is operating in a customs-controlled area. This has also  been  an  area
where there has been uncertainty.
As regards urban development zones, this is a major tax incentive  aimed  at
revitalising the inner cities of our country. A substantial  tax  relief  is
granted to people who are  refurbishing  buildings  in  a  city  either  for
commercial or residential use, in which case they will get  a  straight-line
tax write-off of 20%  over  a  five-year  period.  For  those  who  will  be
constructing anew, they will equally get a  tax  write-off  of  20%  in  the
first year and  then  5%  off  in  future  16  years.  Certain  requirements
stipulate that there be a formal resolution of council to  the  effect  that
it fits into an integrated plan, and it's envisaged that certain areas  will
be designated for tax relief. I think there are  at  least  16  metropolitan
and major inner city areas that have been designated.

A major concession has been  made  to  public  benefit  organisations.  But,
regarding tax-exempt status, those who  now  donate  to  such  organisations
will now also be able to enjoy  the  benefits  of  donations  tax.  This,  I
think, will free up donations, particularly  as  it  has  been  complex  and
there have also been various  amendments  to  the  list  of  public  benefit
organisations. As you know, this committee has placed enormous  emphasis  on
the tax status of  public  benefit  organisations.  We  really  welcome  the
constructive approach from the National Treasury and Sars in this regard.

Other matters that were before us were, of course, the continual  amendments
relating to the Capital Gains Tax. These are coming  through  as  experience
develops with the implementation of Capital Gains  Tax,  the  reworkings  of
arrangements around customs and excise, and  certain  administrative  issues
relating to this.

However, I must say that, in the time allocated, I cannot  give  justice  to
the wide range of issues which are covered by this Bill. I  would  certainly
appeal to a future Parliament that the way in which we process revenue  laws
be re-examined because I do not think that we do justice  to  it  either  in
the committee or the House,  and  to  the  complexities  which  these  Bills
present.

On behalf of the ANC, we support this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P  J  RABIE:  Mr  Chairman,  hon  Minister,  members,  the  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill is a technical Bill and the product of a number of major  tax
reforms which broadened the present tax base.

One of the changes is that we changed from a  residence  to  a  source-based
tax system. In submission to the finance committee, as speakers  have  said,
the drafters of the new legislation in general gave limited  opportunity  to
the compliance complexity of tax legislation and an  appeal  was  made  that
the hon Minister and Treasury will provide for a period of consolidation  in
the years ahead. The hon Minister mentioned in his Budget Statement  that  a
period of tax consolidation was envisaged for the year ahead. This can  only
contribute to a tax culture of compliance.

The Revenue Laws Amendment Bill introduces amendments  to  17  tax  laws.  I
shall briefly refer to a number of them.  There  is  the  amendment  of  the
Transfer Duty Act of 1949, so as to regulate the provisions related  to  the
duty on the conversion of share blocks to  sectional  titles  and  the  duty
payable on the cancellation of transactions. A  positive  amendment  is  the
provision which will allow for changing of the Taxation Laws  Amendment  Act
regarding tax exemption of public benefit organisations and other  entities.
This will enable PBOs to meet  their  financial  commitments.  The  Exchange
Control Amnesty Act is amended regarding the  application  of  beneficiaries
and extends the date of application. All the respective submissions  to  the
finance committee welcomed the extension till 29 February 2004.

The Marketable Securities Tax  Act  of  1948  and  certain  regulations  are
repeated to provide for transitional provisions  relating  to  gold  bullion
and the shares  of  companies  acquired  from  funds  transferred  to  South
Africa. The Value-Added Tax Act of 1991 is amended regarding  the  provision
that  relates  to  assessments,  objectives  and  appeals  that  relate   to
disputes.

Mnr die Voorsitter, Suid-Afrika bevind hom  tans  as  'n  rolspeler  in  die
internasionale beleggingsgemeenskap. Dit is gebiedend  noodsaaklik  dat  ons
belastingstelsel  beleggings-  en  verbruikersvriendelik   is,   maar   geen
geleentheid laat  in  'n  vinnig  veranderende  omgewing  vir  individue  of
instellings om belasting deur middel van skuiwergate te ontduik nie.  Sonder
'n effektiewe en 'n  regverdige  beslastingstelsel  wat  belastingontduiking
ontmoedig, sal  die  sosioekonomiese  gevolge  van  armoede  in  Suid-Afrika
moeilik opgelos word.

Hierdie wetsontwerp is omvangryk en beslaan meer as  138  gedrukte  bladsye.
Die finansiële komitee en amptenare en  belanghebbende  rolspelers  van  die
private  sektor  het  ure  gespandeer  om  'n  haalbare  en   praktykgerigte
wetsontwerp daar te stel. Vergun my ook die geleentheid  om  die  voorsitter
van die finansiële komitee, me Barbara Hogan, baie  hartlik  te  bedank  vir
haar goeie leiding wat sy in dié verband gegee het. Dankie ook  aan  al  die
ander  lede  van  die  finansiële  komitee.  Die  DA  steun  hierdie  gegewe
wetsontwerp. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr Chairman, South Africa currently finds itself to  be  a  role-player  in
the international investment community. It is essential that our tax  system
is investment and consumer-friendly, but leaves no opportunity in a  rapidly
changing environment for individuals or institutions to  evade  tax  through
loopholes. Without an effective and fair tax system  which  discourages  tax
evasion, the socioeconomic consequences of poverty in South Africa will  not
easily be solved.

This Bill is comprehensive and comprises more than 138  printed  pages.  The
finance committee and officials and interested role-players in  the  private
sector spent hours drafting a feasible and practice-oriented Bill. Allow  me
the opportunity very sincerely to  thank  the  chairperson  of  the  finance
committee, Ms Barbara Hogan, for the sound leadership she provided  in  this
regard. Thank you also to all the other members of the finance committee.
The DA supports this particular Bill.]

Dr G G WOODS: Chairperson, tax policy and the law that is  used  to  capture
and interpret this policy are most often very technical and highly  complex,
as previous speakers have mentioned. As such the individual minds  and  even
the collective mind that comprises the Portfolio Committee on Finance  would
be seriously stretched when contemplating Bills such  as  the  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill, if it were not for the particular approach we used.

Here one must also  pay  tribute  to  the  committee  chairperson,  the  hon
Barbara Hogan, who has, over the past few  years,  developed  an  ever  more
effective facilitation type role for the committee in  this  regard.  It  is
where, after gaining a basic  understanding  of  tax  Bills,  substance  and
intentions,  a  range  of  appropriate  experts  and  interest  groups   are
identified  and  invited  to  participate  in  the  committee's  legislative
process. The value of this participation comes from how  these  experts  and
interest groups interact through the committee, with  the  drafters  of  the
law, that being Sars and National Treasury.

I know a number of other committees allow for public participation, but  the
effectiveness of the Portfolio Committee on Finance's  approach,  given  the
complexities of the subject matter we have to deal with and the chairing  of
the hon Hogan and the clever choice of  participants  and  the  constructive
and non-defensive approach of Sars and National Treasury, I  think,  through
this, we produced significant amendments to tax Bills. I found  the  process
rather satisfying and know that the tax laws we pass in the  Assembly,  like
the Bill before us, will amount to well-considered  law.  I  think  the  hon
Hogan, in her earlier comments, is  underestimating  the  effective  way  in
which she does chair the committee through these tax Bills.

As it seems that other  participants  in  this  debate  will  speak  to  the
specific amendments in the Bill, I will use my remaining time just  to  make
one general observation. From 1994 right up to a couple  of  years  ago,  it
was clear that Sars dictated the nature and purpose of all tax law, and  did
so on the basis  of  seeking  a  sound,  efficient  and  fair  system  which
realised  an  optimal  tax  return  for  the  fiscus  each  year.  The  Katz
Commission  tax   reforms   were   also   restricted   to   such   thinking.
Considerations of the broader economy and the tax effects thereon  were  few
and incidental at most, but of late, it seems that National  Treasury's  Tax
Policy  Department  has  been  more  positively  active  in  assessing   and
converting relevant parts of the tax system in a  way  which  will  be  more
consistent and more directly promotive of official economic policy.

It has long been my observation that tax policy has been underplayed in  the
bigger economic scheme of things. It is therefore significant that  National
Treasury's Martin Grote with his economic perspectives  and  his  right-hand
man,  Prof  Ingels  with  his  modern  tax  perspectives,  are  increasingly
influencing the tax system  into  a  more  integrated  and  thereby  a  more
supportive role of the national economy in its search for growth.

We were quite impressed  with  a  recent  analysis  undertaken  by  National
Treasury where a modelling expert, using a wide basis of carefully  thought-
out variables, has explored the possibilities of various tax  approaches  to
FTI. Also positive is learning that National Treasury is thinking of how  we
can use our taxation agreements better in assisting  our  economy  to  grow.
Thank you.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Agb  Voorsitter,  ek  wil  graag  aansluit  by  die  vorige
spreker, die agb dr Woods, om ons  waardering  uit  te  spreek  teenoor  die
voorsitter van ons komitee, me Barbara Hogan, wat werklik  'n  baie  kundige
voorsitter is en baie goed weet wat sy doen. Die sukses van  die  finansiële
komitee se werksaamhede het baie te doen met haar kundigheid  en  die  goeie
leiding wat sy daar gee.

Die Nuwe NP sal hierdie wetsontwerp  plus  die  amendemente  steun.  Dit  is
inderdaad 'n  finansiële  rommelkaswetsontwerp  wat  'n  hele  aantal  wette
amendeer, selfs sover terug as 1949. Wat my egter die mees  opgewonde  maak,
is klousule 28 van hierdie wetsontwerp, wat 'n verandering aanbring aan  die
Inkomstebelastingwet  van  1972,  waarkragtens   ondernemings   wat   begin,
beginnerondernemings,  nou  toegelaat  gaan  word  om  uitgawes  wat   hulle
aangegaan het voordat daardie  onderneming  begin  funksioneer  het,  by  'n
latere geleentheid oor 'n tydperk  gestrek  of  onmiddellik  in  die  eerste
belastingjaar af te skrywe teen hulle inkomste. Ek  weet  nie  wat  dit  die
staat na raming sal kos om dit so te doen  nie,  maar  ek  dink  dit  is  'n
uiters belangrike maatreël wat getref is.

Ek weet u is nou al moeg vir my omdat ek vanmiddag so baie praat  oor  veral
die kleinsakeondernemings,  maar,  mnr  die  Minister,  ek  dink  veral  die
kleinsakeondernemings  sal  dit  baie  waardeer  en  dit   is   werklik   'n
uitstekende stimulus deur wetgewing wat u geskep  het  om  dit  makliker  te
maak om sake aan te gaan soos om 'n bietjie marknavorsing te  doen  voor  'n
mens jou onderneming begin, om 'n lewensvatbaarheidstudie  te  doen,  of  om
omgewingsimpakstudies  te  doen  voor  die  tyd  -  alles  goed   wat   baie
noodsaaklik is, en dit kan nou  afgeskryf  word  en  ons  is  baie  dankbaar
daarvoor. Baie dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Chairperson, I would like  to  associate  myself  with
what  the  previous  speaker,  the  hon  Dr  Woods,  said  to   convey   our
appreciation to the chairperson of our committee, Ms Barbara Hogan,  who  is
truly a very capable chairperson and knows exactly what she  is  doing.  The
success of the finance comittee's activities has a great  deal  to  do  with
her expertise and good leadership.

The New NP will support both this Bill and the amendments. It  is  indeed  a
financial omnibus Bill that amends quite a number of Acts, even as far  back
as 1949. What excites me most, however, is clause 28  of  this  Bill,  which
amends the Income Tax Act of 1972, in terms of which  enterprises  that  are
starting out, emerging enterprises, are now allowed to  write  off  expenses
that they incurred prior to the enterprise starting to function, on a  later
occasion over a period of time or immediately in the first tax  year.  I  do
not know how much it is estimated this will cost the state  to  do  it  this
way, but I think it is a very important measure that has been introduced.

I know you are tired of me already, because I  have  been  talking  so  much
about small business enterprises  in  particular  this  afternoon,  but,  Mr
Minister, I think small business enterprises in particular  will  appreciate
it greatly and it is truly an excellent stimulus, through  legislation  that
you have created, to make it easier to go about matters such as doing a  bit
of market research before  starting  one's  business,  doing  a  feasibility
study, or doing an environmental impact study beforehand - all  things  that
are essential, and this can now be written off and we are very grateful  for
that. Thank you very much.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the Revenue Laws  Amendment  Bill  appears  to
bring a number of Bills in line with the current structure of democracy  and
rule of law. It is very important that each sphere of government  inculcates
the  values  of  the  national  Constitution  and  that  all  factors   that
contribute, influence, enhance and effect such matters be taken seriously.

This Bill amends many Acts,  and  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  these
amendments are made not only for the improvement of revenue securities,  but
also for the betterment of all South Africans. At the end of  the  day,  all
we do is to maintain that we are a government of the people  by  the  people
and that we are answerable to our people all the time. This  is  the  reason
the values of transparency and accountability are so  firmly  entrenched  in
our beauracracy.

We all know the importance  of  national  revenue  in  the  running  of  our
country. In fact, without such revenue, would this be possible?  Many  other
factors contribute to such revenue and  it  is  important  to  maintain  and
improve these.

The MF supports the Revenue Laws Amendment  Bill.  Thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Mr M A TARR: Chair, to generate enthusiasm for a text debate  in  the  dying
stages of a sitting such as today's  is  extremely  difficult.  The  Revenue
Laws Amendment Bill consists of some 226 clauses  and  amends  14  different
Acts dealing with revenue collection. It's impossible, obviously,  as  other
speakers have said, in a short debate of this nature to begin  debating  the
whole Bill in a meaningful way. But, I really believe that Sars need  to  be
congratulated on compiling this Bill and getting the explanatory  memorandum
done in such a short time, because it's an extremely long and complex Bill.

As a general statement, it can be said that  tax  policy  has  been  and  is
under constant review, and this has  resulted  in  significant  improvements
under our current Minister of Finance. Tax policy is a complex  field  where
a number of often competing issues have to  be  dealt  with  simultaneously.
For example, questions such as the  following  need  to  be  addressed:  How
should the tax burden be spread  between  different  taxes,  such  as,  VAT,
personal tax, company tax, customs and excise  duties?  And  then  within  a
category of taxation, for example, our system of progressive  taxation,  how
should that also be spread so as to promote  equity  and  growth?  Then,  of
course, there is another  question  such  as  the  following:  Where  should
concessions be made so as to promote Government policy?

These and many other questions need to be answered. Since  1994,  there  has
been a broadening of the tax base, which has  resulted  in  a  fear  of  tax
burden, and this has also been accompanied by  significant  tax  relief.  We
have seen new taxes, such as the Capital  Gains  Tax,  introduced.  We  have
moved to a residence-based tax collection system and the current year  is  a
continuation of the reform process.

Tax policy has also been aimed at stimulating investments  and  developments
by making various concessions, such  as  the  new  urban  development  zones
discussed by the hon  Barbara  Hogan  today.  Revenue  collection  has  been
improved and there has been a vast overall improvement and change under  our
current Minister. A few examples, which are in the  present  Act,  I  think,
are worth noting. To start with, let's look at ring-fencing.

The issue of ring-fencing sparked  considerable  debate  in  the  committee,
particularly,  in  relation  to  horse  racing.  Ring-fencing  is  aimed  at
preventing losses in the so-called suspect trade from being  offset  against
profits from another trade occupation. That only applies to  individuals  in
the maximum tax bracket who attempt to disguise their hobbies as trades.

The Act sets out a number of rules to identify suspect loss trades, such  as
the three-out-of-five-year-loss rule, and also  lists  a  number  of  trades
which by their very nature give rise to suspicion. The Act also provides  an
escape hatch to prevent ring-fencing being applied,  provided  the  taxpayer
can demonstrate certain features.

Horse racing was originally listed as a suspect  trade,  but  after  hearing
representations, the committee recommended that it be removed from the  list
pending further investigation. This came about because of the unique  nature
of horse racing. While it may be true that there are  many  instances  where
wealthy individuals purchase race horses  and  offset  their  costs  against
other income, the picture does not end there.

The horse racing industry also has many other players, who  all  combine  to
form  a  very  significant  economic  infrastructure,  for  example,   horse
breeders,  who  are  involved  in  making  their  living  out  of  breeding;
trainers, who can train horses; jockeys; farmers;  farmworkers;  turf  clubs
and all their personnel that organise  meetings;  transport  operators;  and
horse  racing  also  provides  a  significant  source  of  tax  revenue   to
provinces.

So taking the above into account, the committee felt that at this  stage  it
would be a good idea if horse racing was removed from  the  list  pending  a
further in-depth investigation by Sars  and  the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry.

I should also mention, of course, that this does not mean  that  the  three-
out-of-five-year rule  does  not  apply.  But,  of  course  this  serves  to
illustrate the point that a given course can actually result in  undesirable
effects elsewhere and illustrates the complexity of the whole tax process.

Other  concessions  we  saw  were  in  research  and  development,  and  the
concessions are aimed at encouraging research and development.  The  present
provisions do not always make it  possible  to  claim  expenditure  and  the
concessions were made to make this possible.

Further concessions were in the area of reinvestment  relief,  and  this  is
aimed at stimulating investments by  providing  tax  relief  on  income  and
capital gain from the  sale  of  an  asset  when  the  proceeds  are  to  be
reinvested within three years.

I have quoted  a  few  examples  in  the  short  time  available  to  me  to
demonstrate ways in which tax policy can be used in a  way  that  encourages
growth and investments, and also some of the pitfalls. I  believe  that  our
hon Minister of Finance is to be congratulated on the way in  which  he  has
reformed the tax system to make it conform with the needs of our  developing
economy. Again, I believe congratulations are due to Sars, and I'm happy  to
support this Bill on behalf of the ANC. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mr Chairperson, there's so much enthusiasm in  this
House that if I added to the Bill, this afternoon, the trebling  of  tax  on
members of Parliament, nobody would  even  notice,  but  the  Hansard  would
reflect that the Bill was thus amended. [Interjections.] Ken  would  notice;
nobody else has noticed.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The Chair is still here, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, may  I  express  appreciation  to  the
committee under the leadership of hon Barbara Hogan. I think they have  done
a fine job and, as the  hon  Woods  has  said,  the  ability  to  influence,
notwithstanding the prohibition on the formal amendments to money Bills,  is
borne out by the fact that the Bill that  entered  the  committee  is  quite
different  from  the  one  that  emerged,  and  I  would  like  to   express
appreciation, because I think we have  learnt  to  understand  how  to  work
around these issues.

I have about 10 and a half minutes left, so  I'll  use  them  to  say  Merry
Christmas to each and every member, and Eid Mubarak. Thank you,  very  much.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The Minister of Finance has  requested
that certain textual corrections to  the  Bill,  as  printed,  be  effected.
These corrections have been circulated to all members and will  also  appear
in the minutes of proceedings for record purposes.

Question put: That Bill, with textual corrections, be read a first time.

4.    Report of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
     Development on  the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Bill  [B  19  -  2002]
     (National Assembly - sec 75), dated 24 November 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Justice and Constitutional  Development,
         having considered the subject of the Prevention of Corruption  Bill
         [B 19 - 2002] (National Assembly - sec  75),  referred  to  it  and
         classified by the Joint Tagging Mechanism as  a  section  75  Bill,
         endorses  the  classification  of  the  Bill   and   presents   the
         Prevention and Combating  of  Corrupt  Activities  Bill  [B  19B  -
         2002].


         The Committee reports further, as follows:


         1. Having  considered  the  Prevention  and  Combating  of  Corrupt
              Activities Bill [B 19B - 2002], the Committee is of  the  view
              that certain  offences  may  overlap,  and  the  Committee  is
              concerned that an accused person may be charged and  convicted
              of committing different offences arising from the  same  facts
              and  circumstances.   The   Committee   therefore   considered
              including the following provision in the Bill:
                Accused  person  may  not  be  charged  on  same  facts  and
                circumstances


                  21A. Nothing in this Chapter contained shall be  construed
                as allowing a person to be convicted of committing different
                offences arising from  the  same  facts  and  circumstances:
                Provided that, if by reason of any  uncertainty  as  to  the
                facts which can be proved or if for any other reason  it  is
                doubtful which of several offences  is  constituted  by  the
                facts which can be proved, the accused may be  charged  with
                the commission of all or  any  of  such  offences,  and  any
                number of such charges may be tried at once, or the  accused
                may be charged in the alternative with the commission of any
                number of such offences.".


         2. However, the Committee is of the view that the  above  provision
              may be superfluous, in view of, amongst others, the  following
              provisions:


              (a) Section 35(3)(m) of the Constitution provides  that  every
                  accused  person  has  a  right  to  a  fair  trial,  which
                  includes the right not to  be  tried  for  an  offence  in
                  respect of an act or omission for which  that  person  has
                  previously been either acquitted or convicted.


              (b) Section 336 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977  (Act  No.
                  51 of 1977),  provides  that  where  an  act  or  omission
                  constitutes  an  offence  under  two  or  more   statutory
                  provisions or is an offence against a statutory  provision
                  and the common law, the  person  guilty  of  such  act  or
                  omission shall, unless the contrary intention appears,  be
                  liable  to  be  prosecuted  and  punished   under   either
                  statutory provision or, as the  case  may  be,  under  the
                  statutory provision or the common law, "but shall  not  be
                  liable  to  more  than  one  punishment  for  the  act  or
                  omission constituting the offence".


              (c) Paragraphs (c) and (d) of  section  106  of  the  Criminal
                  Procedure Act, 1977, provide that when an  accused  pleads
                  to a charge he  may,  among  others,  plead  that  he  has
                  already been convicted of the offence  with  which  he  is
                  charged(par (c)), or that he has  already  been  acquitted
                  of the offence with which he is charged (par (d)).


         3. In spite of the above provisions, the  Committee  did  not  have
              time to  thoroughly  research  and  discuss  the  matter.  The
              Committee therefore recommends that the Department of  Justice
              and Constitutional Development be requested to investigate the
              matter and to report back to the Committee within three months
              of the date of adoption of this Report.

         The Portfolio Committee on  Home  Affairs,  having  considered  the
