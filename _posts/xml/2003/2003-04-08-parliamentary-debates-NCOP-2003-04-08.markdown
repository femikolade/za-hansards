                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                       (The late Ms S N Ntlabati, MP)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, as this House of  Parliament  it
is appropriate that we  dedicate  time  to  offer  our  condolences  to  the
Ntlabati family. Today we say to the family: Your grief  is  our  grief.  As
this House of Parliament and the ANC we say: It is a  grief  to  this  House
because as we gather here,  we  remember  the  distinguished  role  she  has
played in the politics of this country. In her political  life  Ms  Senorita
Ntlabati was instrumental in the  formation  of  the  progressive  structure
within the nursing profession. This structure, within  the  broad  framework
of the Mass Democratic Movement, contributed to the demise,  in  a  way,  of
the apartheid regime.

The ANC noted her leadership qualities such that she was considered for  the
leadership roles, among others,  from  1994-1999  she  became  the  MEC  for
Social Services and Health in the Free State province, where  she  performed
exceptionally well, especially if one was to consider that our democracy  in
South Africa was new and the challenges  were  quite  enormous.  She  proved
beyond reasonable doubt that  she  was  worthy  of  appointment  by  further
spearheading transformation programmes with  the  health  sector,  a  sector
which was extremely prejudicial and exclusive at the  expense  of  the  vast
majority of our people. In 1999 she was then appointed a permanent  delegate
from the Free State to the NCOP. The NCOP at the time was  still  undergoing
transformation from Senate to what it is today.

In recognising her abilities in facilitating transformation, the  ANC  found
it necessary to deploy Ms Ntlabati to play a meaningful role. She proved  to
be hard-working and tenacious in performing  her  duty.  Committees  in  the
NCOP needed further transformation and she became the appropriate person  to
take the process forward and was thus appointed Chairperson  of  Committees,
a position she occupied until her untimely demise.

In presiding over sittings of the Council most  of  you  will  remember  and
miss her for her chuckles and her laughter over  the  microphone.  You  will
remember her for being the sharp and strict person that she was. I miss  her
for shouting in the passage, her willingness and her  informal  disposition,
for her caring nature, her compassion and willingness to serve not only  the
interests of the ANC, but this institution as a whole.
Amongst  the  other  characteristics  that  Ms  Ntlabati  showed   was   her
commitment to gender empowerment, gender mainstreaming and  in  this  regard
she  played  a  very  important  role.  She  served  in  various  leadership
positions in various positions  both  in  South  Africa  and  SADC  and  her
contribution will be sadly missed. We as  Council  wish  her  two  surviving
sons and members of her family well during this  very  traumatic  time.  Our
hearts and our best wishes are with the family and we  stand  in  solidarity
with the Ntlabati family. I so move, Chairperson. Thank you.

Dr P J C NEL: Voorsitter, ek wil graag aansluit by wat  die  vorige  spreker
reeds gesê het oor Senorita Ntlabati. Ek het 'n lang  verbintenis  met  haar
gehad. Sy was die  Vrystaat  se  eerste  LUR  vir  Gesondheid  in  die  nuwe
demokratiese bestel vanaf 1994 tot 1999. Terwyl  ek  vir  dieselfde  tydperk
lid van die Vrystaatse portefeuljekomitee van gesondheid  was,  het  ons  'n
goeie werksverhouding opgebou. Hoewel ons aan verskillende politieke  partye
behoort  het  en  soms  van  mekaar  verskil  het,  het  ons  altyd  op   'n
vriendskaplike en beskaafde wyse  gepoog  om  die  beste  bedeling  vir  die
Vrystaatse gesondheidstelsel te beding.

Weens die feit dat sy vir 'n lang tyd nie goeie gesondheid geniet  het  nie,
was dit vir my 'n voorreg om haar as geneesheer by tye  te  kon  bystaan  en
hopelik tot hulp te kon wees, veral gedurende die laaste jaar.

Ons in die kleiner partye sal Senorita onthou as die klein  mensie  met  die
groot hart, wat nie geskroom het wanneer sy in die Stoel gesit  het  om  die
kleiner partye te beskerm en na hul belange om te  sien  nie.  Ek  dink  die
Huis sal haar goeie sin vir humor en kenmerkende laggie vanaf die  kant  van
die Stoel, asook in die komitees altyd onthou. My party wil ook graag  langs
hierdie weg sy meegevoel teenoor  haar  kinders,  Mnre  MacMillan  en  Uhuru
Mokoena en haar familie uitspreek. Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I  would  like  to  associate  myself  with  the
previous speaker in what he had to say about  Senorita  Ntlabati.  I  had  a
long association with her. She was the Free State's first MEC for Health  in
the new democratic order from 1994 till 1998. Whilst during the same  period
I was a member of the Free State's portfolio committee on Health,  we  built
up  a  sound  working  relationship.  Although  we  belonged  to   different
political parties and sometimes differed, we always strived  in  a  friendly
way to negotiate the best dispensation for the Free State's health system.

Owing to the fact that she did not enjoy good health for  a  long  time,  it
was my privilege as medical doctor to assist her  and  hopefully  to  be  of
some help from time to time, especially over the past year.

We in the smaller parties will remember Senorita as a small  person  with  a
big heart, who, whenever she was  in  the  Chair,  did  not  shy  away  from
protecting the smaller parties and looking after their  interests.  I  think
the House will always remember her good sense of humour  and  characteristic
little laugh from the Chair, as well as in committees. My party  would  also
like to  express,  in  this  way,  its  sympathy  to  her  children,  Messrs
Macmillan and Uhuru Mokoena and her family. Thank you.]

Me C-S BOTHA: Voorsitter, dit is met 'n gevoel  van  groot  verlies  wat  ek
vandag my meegevoel wil betuig nie net namens die DA nie, maar  ons  vriende
en mede-Vrystaters met die afsterwe van Senorita Ntlabati.

Sy het werklik haar merk gemaak. Sy was nie  klein  van  gees  nie.  Sy  was
groot van gees, al was sy klein van postuur. Ek het haar  in  daardie  Stoel
waarin u nou sit, sien groei tot iemand wat werklik tot formidabele  optrede
in staat is. Sy was na my mening die soort politikus wat mens moet  nastrewe
om te wees. Sy was dapper en uitgesproke en sy  het  onafhanklik  gebly.  Ek
het haar baie keer dinge hoor sê wat nie net populêr was nie,  maar  wat  sy
gedink het is reg. Daai gees gaan ons hier  mis  en  ons  gaan  dit  in  die
Vrystaat ook mis.

Ek wil veral sê hoe die naam van haar seun, naamlik Uhuru, my  opgeval  het.
Dit bewys dat sy deur haar hele lewe haar verbintenis  tot  vryheid  ernstig
opgeneem en langs hierdie weg wil ek ook dan sê aan  haar  familie  en  haar
vriende:  Ons  gaan  haar  regtig  mis.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  speech
follows.)

[Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson it is  with  a  feeling  of  great  loss  that  I
express my condolences today, not only on behalf  of  the  DA  but  also  on
behalf of friends and  fellow  Free  Staters  on  the  passing  of  Senorita
Ntlabati.

She really made her mark. She was not small in spirit. She was  big-spirited
although she was small in posture. I saw her grow in that  Chair,  in  which
you are now sitting, to someone who is really capable of remarkable  action.
In my opinion she was the type of politician one should strive  to  be.  She
was  courageous  and  outspoken  and  she  remained  independent.  On   many
occasions I heard her saying things which were not only  popular,  but  what
she thought was right. We are going to miss that  spirit  here  and  we  are
going to miss it in the Free State as well.

I would especially like to say how  the  name  of  her  son,  namely  Uhuru,
struck me. This  proves  that  throughout  her  entire  life  she  took  her
connection to freedom seriously and in this vein I would also  like  to  say
to her family and friends: We are really going to miss her.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, we did not  have  a  lot  to  do  with  Senorita
Nlatabati in this House, except at a  personal  level.  But  she  was  kind,
friendly and fair and had a good sense of humour. She  was  even-handed  and
we would like to associate ourselves with the  remarks  made  by  the  Chief
Whip and extend our deepest sympathy to her family and children.

Mr J O TLHAGALE: Thank you very  much,  Chairperson.  Hon  Minister  in  the
House, it was with the greatest shock and sadness for me to read  about  the
sudden death of our beloved colleague Senorita, in Friday's Sowetan.  I  was
in Pretoria then. Senorita, short of stature but huge  spiritually  was  not
only a colleague but was also a mother with a likeable disposition.

During our parliamentary visit to Taung in the North  West  Province  I  was
seated next to her or she was seated next to me  for  the  duration  of  our
stay at Taung. And I found her to be a very good  lady  who  could  converse
and could open up and cause one to open up. We shall miss her  and  we  want
to express our condolences to her beloved family. Thank you.

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chair, I wish to express on behalf of the UDM and myself,  -
because I was already used to senorita - condolences to the bereaved  family
of Ms Ntlabati. The death of a colleague and sister caused a great shock  to
us, especially since the days of her illness were very short.  We  lost  one
of the powerful ladies, a  lady  politician  and  an  administrator  in  her
position as Chair of Committees - and what we have heard from our hon  Chief
Whip.

We have lost one of the highly dedicated and committed service providers,  a
team-mate  in  our  cause  for  transformation   and   upliftment   of   the
historically  disadvantaged  people  of  our  country.  I  will   personally
remember her cheerful smile. I think most of us here will recall that  smile
and her unique style of laughter. May we wish her a peaceful rest  and  hope
and courage to the family at home. Thank you, Chairperson.

Mr M J BHENGU: Chairperson, I am sure many of you know that  I  am  standing
up as a very devastated person, in a sense that  Senorita  was  actually  my
colleague in the NCOP and many of you know how closely we  worked  together.
I have been advised that I will be saying more words about her on  Thursday.
I would like to say that we have lost one of our giants in the NCOP.

Inkatha Freedom Party  ithi,  ``ahambe  kahle!  Abakubo  nezihlobo  mabalale
ngenxeba.'' Siyabonga. [The IFP says: ``Rest in peace! The  family  and  the
relatives must be consoled''.] Thank you.

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  MAHLANGU):  May  we  rise  and
observe a moment of silence.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I will move at the next sitting of this House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the silent debt crisis that is ravaging  family  life  in  South
           Africa;


       (b)  that 3000 debt judgments per day  are  being  made  with  people
           blacklisted and taken out of the economy, sometimes for up to 30
           years, and  that  in  January  2003  alone  over  100  000  debt
           summonses were issued, 56% more than in 1994;


       (c)  that the cost is estimated at one billion rand per month, taking
           into account direct costs and the costs to the economy;


       (d)   that  employees  have  piled  up  debt  of  R15  billion   with
           microlenders, R10  billion  with  furniture  retailers  and  R18
           billion with municipalities; and


       (e)  the continuing ravaging effect  of  gambling  and  of  rapacious
           microlenders that predate upon these families;


  (2) calls upon the Government to establish a  commission  of  inquiry  to
       devise ways and means to stop this rot  that  affects  some  120  000
       employees per annum; and


  (3) further calls upon the Government to stop issuing  any  new  gambling
       licenses or permission to widen the scope and scale  of  gambling  in
       South Africa.

Mr C ACKERMANN: Voorsitter, ek gee kennis dat by die  volgende  sitting  van
die Huis sal voorstel [Chairperson, I give notice that I shall move  at  the
next sitting of the House]:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) a recent poll by Markdata and the Helen Suzman Foundation found  that
       the DA leader, the hon Tony Leon, has the second most  support  among
       right-wingers, support that  already  stands  at  32%  and  is  still
       rising;


  (2) this poll confirms the suspicion that the DA has a  right-wing  power
       base, and that it is also clear that the DA has replaced the CP  and,
       with its growing right-wing power  base,  is  catching  up  with  the
       Freedom Front;


  (3) the DA are bluffing themselves if they think their support  is  based
       on their so-called liberal  convictions,  because  it  is  right-wing
       support that makes the hon Tony Leon the second most  popular  right-
       wing leader;
  (4) this poll also shows that the DA is not a party  that  has  the  best
       interests of all South Africans at heart, but  rather  a  party  that
       hankers after the old  apartheid  South  Africa,  as  most  of  their
       members of Parliament are white; and


  (5) the NNP knows that South Africa belongs to  all  South  Africans  and
       that we, only if we as white, brown,  black  and  Indian  communities
       join hands, can build a South Africa that has the interests of all of
       us at heart.

                    CHILDREN THE VICTIMS OF GANG VIOLENCE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A  MATTHEE:  Voorsitter,  ek  stel  hiermee  sonder  kennisgewing  voor
[Chairperson, I move without notice]:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that another  child  victim  of  gang  violence,  five-year-old
       Roxanne Dickson, died at the Tygerberg Hospital last  Sunday  evening
       while doctors were trying in vain to save her after she had been shot
       in the chest during a gunfight outside a shebeen;


  (2) also notes that Roxanne Dickson was the seventh  child  in  the  Cape
       Metropole to have died in the crossfire of alleged  gang  members  in
       the past month;


  (3) expresses its sincere condolences to the parents, next of kin and all
       the loved ones of these deceased children, as well as of  the  adults
       who have died through gang violence in recent times;


  (4) expresses the hope and trust that the injured  children  as  well  as
       other casualties will soon recover completely; and


  (5) urgently appeals to the national Government as well  as  the  Western
       Cape government and the local government of the Cape Metropole to  do
       everything possible to end this slaughter of our young  and  innocent
       children, including any drastic measures that  may  be  necessary  in
       order to bring this repulsive gang violence to  an  end  as  soon  as
       possible.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                        CONGRATULATIONS TO ERNIE ELS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the World's No 2 in world golf, our very  own  Ernie  Els,
       began the year in magnificent form by  winning  no  fewer  than  five
       major tournaments, starting with the prestigious  British  Open  last
       year;


  (2) records its congratulations to the Big Easy, as he is  affectionately
       known;


  (3) wishes him every luck in the clash  of  giants  at  the  US  Masters,
       starting this Thursday at Augusta, as the golfing world watches  with
       great excitement and anticipation the duel  for  supremacy  in  world
       golf between Tiger Woods, the World's No 1, and Ernie Els.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                      CONTINUED VIOLENT ATTACKS ON IRAQ

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1)  deplores  the  continued  military  attack  on  Iraq  by  individual
       countries without any authorisation from the United Nations  Security
       Council or General Assembly;


  (2)  notes  with  deep  concern  the  continuing  deterioration  of   the
       humanitarian conditions of the Iraqi population, due to the war;


  (3) reiterates its deep concern about the considerable rise in the number
       of civilian casualties, particularly children, as a  result  of  this
       unjust war;


  (4) calls on the United States and  Britain  to  immediately  halt  their
       savage assault on innocent civilians, women and children; and


  (5) expresses the view that the UN should be allowed to  take  action  to
       alleviate the humanitarian consequences of  this  war  in  accordance
       with the principles of  independence;  impartiality,  neutrality  and
       humanity.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                              WORLD HEALTH DAY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  yesterday was World Health Day;


       (b)  each year on 7 April the world celebrates World Health Day;


       (c)  this  year  the  theme  for  World  Health  Day  is  "A  Healthy
           Environment for Children";


       (d)  this is a very appropriate  theme  as  children  are  especially
           vulnerable to major environmental threats;
       (e)  the lives of approximately 5 million children between  the  ages
           of 1 and 14  that  die  annually  from  environmentally  related
           illnesses can be saved through the creation of healthy  settings
           like access to clean water, sanitation  and  hygiene  education;
           and


       (f)  each member of the Council whether being a  parent,  grandparent
           or unmarried person without children  has  a  responsibility  to
           protect children in their homes,  gardens,  motor  vehicles  and
           their communities; and


  (2) calls upon all members of the Council  and  the  public  to  join  in
       promoting healthy environments for our children on World  Health  Day
       and every other day of the year.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL REVIEW

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chairperson,  hon  members,  representatives
of provincial legislatures, representatives of organised  local  government,
friends, when tabling the 2003 Budget on 26 February this  year,  we  stated
that the Budget:


  ... extends and strengthens our  growth  and  development  strategy,  and
  progressively realises the social and economic rights of our  people.  It
  embodies a set of policies aimed at pushing back the frontiers of poverty
  whilst supporting growth and creating opportunities. It seeks to  empower
  people by expanding their capabilities.

We emphasised that accountability for service  delivery  is  fundamental  to
achieving the outcomes we seek. We said then that responsibility  ultimately
stops here.

We, in Parliament, in provincial legislatures and in municipal councils  are
charged  with  ensuring  that  the  funds  we  vote  ``are  responsibly  and
effectively  employed''.  This  means  ensuring  that   our   policies   are
implemented efficiently, courteously, honestly  and  enthusiastically;  that
people experience quality service delivery; that we push back the  frontiers
of poverty; that we empower people  by  expanding  their  capabilities;  and
that we support growth and create opportunities.

The national Budget allocates 61,2% of available  funds  to  the  provincial
and local spheres of government. Now that provinces have tabled  their  2003
budgets and municipalities are  about  to  table  their  three-year  budgets
during May and June, we are pleased to report to this House how  such  funds
have been allocated. More importantly, we  report  on  the  expenditure  and
service delivery trends in key sectors.

The  2003  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  we  table  before  you   today
demonstrates  Government's  commitment  to  accounting  to  Parliament   and
provincial legislatures on the use of public funds. It provides  information
on the 2003 provincial budgets tabled by MECs of Finance between  4  and  18
March 2003. It provides information on the 2002-03  municipal  budgets;  and
it accounts for public expenditures for the past  three  financial  years  -
that is, 1999-2000  to  2001-02.  The  review  spells  out  in  more  detail
spending plans for the nine provinces and 284 local governments, taking  the
focus on service delivery one step forward and  enabling  users  to  compare
provincial and municipal service delivery standards and achievements.

As most members will recall, this is our  fourth  review.  Previous  reviews
were published around September/October. We have brought  forward  the  date
of tabling, with the  objective  of  ensuring  that  Parliament,  provincial
legislatures and municipal councils can  use  the  review  when  considering
their own 2003 budgets.

Provinces have delayed their second  reading  debates  to  enable  portfolio
committee hearings to consider the information set  out  in  the  review.  I
wish to thank them for their  latitude.  The  earlier  tabling  also  allows
Parliament to provide guidance and inputs for the 2004 budgets. Yes,  Deputy
Chair, Parliament can already now play a more proactive role when  approving
budgets. And I'm sure the hon Ralane is listening and making  careful  notes
about this fact.

The tabling of the review in the NCOP recognises the role that the NCOP,  in
particular, can and must play. It is our hope  that  the  NCOP  can  be  the
portal  through  which  provincial  and  local  spheres  of  government  can
participate more effectively in the  budget  allocation  and  accountability
processes. It is also our hope that the NCOP will  spread  the  information,
best practices and insights of the 2003 Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  to
provincial legislatures and municipal councils. To the extent that the  NCOP
succeeds in this objective, it will ensure that  these  elected  bodies  all
play their part in holding provinces and municipalities accountable for  the
delivery of basic services and to ensure that we are getting value  for  our
money.

The review considers provincial and local government budget and  expenditure
trends through the lens  of  eight  sectors.  These  are  school  education,
health,  social  development,  housing,  land  and  agriculture,  roads  and
transport infrastructure, and the provision of water and electricity.

These areas are key among those  that  comprise  the  social  wage  that  we
deliver to our people. As the President noted in his  state  of  the  nation
address earlier this year, the social wage:


  ... has improved with each passing year. It includes the increased number
  of water and electricity connections, the patent improvements in teaching
  and learning in our schools, the acceleration  of  land  restitution  and
  redistribution programmes, primary health care and free housing.

In the 2003 Budget we tabled in Parliament  an  amount  of  R171 billion  is
allocated. This is roughly about 61% of nationally raised revenue, which  is
allocated to provinces and local government. This  review  shows  that  with
increased national transfers and building  on  the  robust  fiscal  position
attained through prudent financial management, provinces are in a very  firm
position to deliver the crucial social services  assigned  to  them  by  the
Constitution.

The 2003 provincial budgets consolidated in this  review  represent  a  real
expression of co-operative governance.  They  reflect  strong  alignment  to
national priorities  articulated  in  the  2002  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement  and  subsequently  in  the  2003  Budget  Review.  Provinces  are
budgeting R164 billion for their 2003-04 budgets.

Consistent with the priorities set out  in  the  Medium-Term  Budget  Policy
Statement, provincial budgets prioritise  pro-poor  social  services,  which
together amount to R133,6 billion or 80,8% of total provincial spending.

Provinces are succeeding in curtailing growth in personnel expenditure.  The
downward trend, which started three years ago, is set to continue  over  the
MTEF, resulting in a further decline in the share of  personnel  from  51,6%
in the 2002-03 fiscal year to 46,4%  in  2005-06.  This  will  release  more
resources for delivery, with nonpersonnel expenditure expected  to  rise  to
over 53% by 2005-06.

Income support continues to be one of our weapons for  fighting  poverty  in
the short term. One of Government's greatest achievements  is  the  increase
in  the  number  of  social  grant  beneficiaries,  which   increased   from
2,5 million in April of 1997 to 5,6 million in April this year.

As we extend the child support grant to children until their  14th  birthday
over the next three years, we expect to add no fewer  than  3  million  more
beneficiaries. This will see budgeted  total  spending  on  social  security
grants rising from R27,3 billion in 2002-03  to  R44,6 billion  in  2005-06,
including the R1,1 billion,  R3,4 billion  and  R6,4 billion  child  support
extension grant. The review shows  that  the  share  of  social  development
spending will rise to 26% of provincial spending in 2005-06.

Total education spending grows by 4,6% in real terms from  R53,1 billion  to
R58,9 billion in 2003-04. The highest growth is in  nonpersonnel  noncapital
expenditure. This  is  expected  to  help  the  sector  allocate  increasing
amounts to learner support materials and also to reinforce  improvements  in
the quality of school education. Spending  on  education  capital  over  the
next three years is budgeted to be R10,3 billion.
The review also deals with  outputs  in  education.  On  the  one  hand,  it
considers provincial performance in respect of matriculation pass rates.  On
the other hand, it reviews provincial attainment in maths and science -  key
requirements for a skilled workforce. The review indicates  that  only  7,9%
of learners attain maths on the higher grade, while 38,8% pass maths on  the
standard grade. South Africa's challenge is to encourage  more  learners  to
register and pass  maths  on  the  higher  grade,  ensuring  that  we  amass
appropriate skills for a growing economy.

Provincial health budgets grow by R3,6 billion or  4,5%  in  real  terms  to
R36,9 billion in 2003-04, and are expected to  grow  in  real  terms  at  an
average annual rate of 3,3% over the Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  to
R42,9 billion in 2005-06.

Improving health service delivery depends  largely  on  having  the  correct
skills in the correct place. Additional resources over the next three  years
provide for the costs of hiring and deploying personnel with  scarce  skills
in the sector, such as doctors and pharmacists. Strong growth in  provincial
health  budgets  also  enables  the  sector   to   improve   the   equitable
distribution and retention of health professionals across  the  country.  In
particular, this intervention facilitates the deployment  of  large  numbers
of health professionals to rural areas.

Quality  health  care  also  depends   on   adequate   medicine   and   drug
availability. Over the  next  three  years  strong  growth  in  nonpersonnel
spending in health will allow hospitals and  clinics  to  ensure  sufficient
supplies of medicines,  drugs  and  other  medical  necessities.  Growth  in
health  budgets  also  provides  for  the  roll-out  of  programmes  on  the
prevention of  mother-to-child  transmission  and  for  an  acceleration  of
appropriate treatment programmes for HIV/Aids and related diseases.

In  addition  to  social  services,  provinces  also  budget  for   housing,
provincial  roads,  agriculture,  economic  affairs,  the  environment   and
tourism, as well as other administrative functions.  Spending  on  nonsocial
services functions, including housing, rises from R27,3 billion  in  2002-03
to R31,6 billion in 2003-04, or 19,2% of total  provincial  expenditure.  It
is set to rise to R36,7 billion by 2005-06.

The ability of our economy to grow fast  on  a  sustained  basis  in  future
depends on how much  we  invest  in  infrastructure  development,  including
roads and other transport infrastructure. Government spent R11,6 billion  on
national and provincial roads between the  1999-2000  fiscal  year  and  the
2001-02 fiscal year. Spending by provinces accounts for R8,9 billion or  77%
in agriculture, which resulted from the strong growth of about a 28%  annual
average over this period. The provincial budgets  for  roads  grow  by  9,8%
over the MTEF period to R6 billion in 2005-06.

Local government roads budgets are also significant. Spending  on  municipal
roads is estimated at about R1,8 billion in 2002-03,  with  the  six  metros
accounting for about 50%, or R892 million.

In respect of agriculture and land,  at  the  request  of  this  House  this
year's review includes a chapter on agriculture and land. The  inclusion  of
such a chapter could not have come at a better time than now when  parts  of
the country are confronted with the threat of food security.

Currently, the combined budget for the national and  provincial  departments
of  agriculture  amounts  to  R4,1 billion,   increasing   by   13,3%   from
R3,5 billion in the last fiscal year, and rising to R4,5 billion  two  years
hence. Provincial  agriculture  budgets  account  for  75%  of  spending  on
agriculture, and for the strong growth, rising by  17,6%  in  2002-03,  from
R2,6 billion to R3,1 billion in the current  year.  Provincial  budgets  are
projected to further grow by an average of 9,3% to  reach  R3,4 billion  two
years down the line.

While noting  the  tremendous  progress  made  in  land  redistribution  and
restitution, the chapter highlights the need to  revitalise  and  strengthen
extension support services for developing  farmers.  Of  the  69 000  claims
lodged with the Restitution Commission, a total of 36 279 claims  have  been
settled, involving 85 000 households. The total financial compensation  paid
for settled claims up to December last year  amounts  to  R1,2 billion,  and
about 512 912 hectares of  land  have  been  restored  at  a  cost  of  R431
million. A total of R1,5 million  hectares  of  land  has  been  transferred
under the redistribution programme to about 129 093 households between  1994
and December last year.

Local government budgets for 2002-03 - that's the  year  which  ends  on  30
June - total about R74,5 billion, including capital  of  R13,1 billion.  The
three  biggest  metros  have  budgets  of  around  R10 billion  -  that   is
Johannesburg, Cape Town and eThekwini.

Local  government  systems  are  nascent,  yet  gaining  momentum  in  their
delivery capacity. As we continue to strengthen  local  capacity,  financial
management and accountability, we look forward to enhanced service  delivery
in this sphere of government. Local government has to follow the road  built
by  provinces,  implementing  similar  reforms.  The   Municipal   Financial
Management Bill, to be passed  this  year,  lays  the  basis  for  municipal
financial management reforms and improved service delivery.

Government has called for the roll-out of free basic services as one of  its
major policy initiatives. There is marked progress in the delivery  of  free
basic water. To date, over 76% of  municipalities  are  now  providing  free
basic  water  to  communities.  Over  3,5  million  households   have   been
electrified since 1994, whilst 34% of households  still  remain  unserviced,
with 51% of these being in the rural areas.

The major backlog for both electricity and  water  is  in  the  rural  areas
where on-grid electricity and piped water  are  not  economical,  and  hence
other types of supply mechanisms are required.

I have pleasure in presenting the 2003 Intergovernmental Fiscal  Review  for
consideration by this House. I trust that in the hearings  next  week  these
matters will be discussed and debated and, perhaps  more  importantly,  that
the detail in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review will  be  carried  to  the
provincial legislatures by the distinguished members of this Council.  Also,
we must ensure that our people understand what the money they pay  in  taxes
buys. It doesn't matter who these people are - whether they are the  poorest
of our people paying taxes by way of VAT, or the wealthiest  of  our  people
paying capital gains tax. All of our people have the right to know,  and  we
have the obligation to ensure that people's rights are fulfilled.

We must tell people  what  the  money  buys.  The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review, which is not a requirement in law, does precisely that  -  it  tells
us what the money buys. It can mark for us the road that we  have  traversed
since 1994 until the present and, very importantly, it is able to  sketch  a
picture going forward of what remains to be done.

I commend the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review 2003 to the  National  Council
of Provinces for consideration. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you,  hon
Minister. The message is quite loud and clear.

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, first of  all  I  would  like  to  express  my
appreciation to the Minister of Finance and the officials from the  National
Treasury for the excellent work  that  they  have  done  and  also  for  the
improvements on the documents that they continue to present  in  Parliament.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Ministry on behalf of  this
House.

In receiving this document on behalf of the Select Committee on  Finance,  I
would like to appeal to the relevant committees  in  this  House  to  engage
departments, different provinces and  municipalities  as  the  Minister  has
already clearly outlined in the document. This will help to  assist  members
as policy makers in their areas of work.

The IGFR is the best benchmark that has ever been produced in  South  Africa
and as the Minister has said it is the fourth edition. We must use it  as  a
tool to measure progress that we have made thus far.  It  will  address  the
challenges and difficulties that we encounter in our quest to push back  the
frontiers of poverty, as clearly stated in  the  President's  state  of  the
nation address.

As we go to our constituencies we should, before we return  in  May,  engage
our provinces and our different municipalities. This  will  help  to  assist
and enrich the process further. The process has to be  followed  from  today
onwards. We will have discussions with National Treasury  tomorrow  and  all
its officials, with the different chapters, all members of the NCOP and  all
its respective committees as outlined in the document. I have  been  invited
to this meeting including other committees  of  the  National  Assembly  and
provincial legislatures.

Thereafter, the relevant committees of  the  NCOP  will  conduct  their  own
public hearings on their relevant chapter and involve provinces in terms  of
the members of the provincial legislatures and relevant MECs. We  will  then
return to the House with a comprehensive and detailed report to  enable  the
House to reflect  on  the  findings  of  the  different  committees  and  to
determine whether as a country we have been  able  to  meet  the  objectives
that we set out for ourselves.

In conclusion, may I once again invite all members present here to  rise  to
the challenge by reading through each and  every  chapter.  Members  do  not
need to read through  all  chapters,  however,  they  should  read  chapters
relevant to their committees so as to enable them to have insight  to  their
work. They should also do comparisons with ideas that have  been  tabled  so
far. In this way we will be able to measure whether we are  making  progress
or not and to determine whether provinces are making progress or not. It  is
important for members to read so as to determine our future.

This document will assist us to  measure  whether  Government  policies  and
priorities as outlined in different budget documents are being realised.  It
will be up to members of Parliament to make those observations and  to  make
proposals on how best we can improve the situation for the  benefit  of  all
South Africans, in particular the poor that we represent and need  to  serve
more than anybody else.

When the report returns to the House we will make a detailed observation  on
what we think as different members and as the Select Committee  on  Finance.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        PENSIONS (SUPPLEMENTARY) BILL

     (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Finance
                                  thereon).

Order disposed of without debate.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                            USURY AMENDMENT BILL

  (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Economic and
                          Foreign Affairs thereon)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson and hon members, I  wish  to  thank  you  for  this
opportunity. In the past two years our country has seen the  mushrooming  of
the microlending industry. Many people out there, especially the poor,  rely
heavily on this industry for their survival as it is easier to  borrow  from
these microlenders than  from  formal  banks.  Some  of  these  microlenders
became very unscrupulous and super exploited the unsuspecting masses of  our
people. Therefore, a need arose for these people to be regulated.

The Minister of Trade and Industry, comrade Alec Erwin, exempted  a  certain
category of moneylending transactions from the provisions of the  Usury  Act
which is an Act that regulates finance charges levied  in  moneylending  and
credit transactions. The main condition for these exemptions is  that  these
moneylenders  should  be  registered  with  the  Micro  Finance   Regulatory
Council,  the  MFRC.  This  is  the  sole  regulatory  institution  in   the
microlending industry at present. It is entrusted  with  the  responsibility
of regulating the activities of the sector with the  purpose  of  protecting
the consumers against unfair lending practices. The MFRC deals with  lenders
where transactions do not exceed R10 000 and the repayment period  does  not
exceed 36 months.

The microlending industry has become a little more reputable since  it  came
under formal regulation in 1999. The industry is now  so  consolidated  that
even formal banking and retail sectors have  entered  this  sector.  Members
will be aware that even companies  such  as  Woolworths  are  part  of  this
industry now. These new entrants  also  came  up  with  new  products  which
enable consumers to have a broader choice. At the same time we have  a  very
large number of these microlenders who are not  registered  with  the  MFRC,
but who are using the provisions of the exemption, such as the  charging  of
interest rates which are more than 9%. By so doing, these  microlenders  are
contravening the provisions of the Usury Act.  They  therefore  need  to  be
followed up and the people prosecuted.
The Usury Act provides that  only  civil  servants  be  given  the  task  of
inspecting  microlenders.  The  Usury  Amendment  Bill  before  this   House
proposes to change this situation.  It  proposes  that  persons  other  than
public service officials be appointed as inspectors to  conduct  inspections
on a large number of unregistered microlenders who  contravene  policies  of
the Usury Act, as stated earlier on. This will go a long way to enhance  the
enforcement   capacity   to   protect   consumers   from   these   predatory
moneylenders.

The Bill further proposes the redefinition of the Registrar and his  or  her
powers in relation to inspection. The definition is amended to  include  the
chief executive officer of the MFRC, so that the persons  appointed  by  the
Registrar and the CEO as inspectors can have the same powers  to  carry  out
inspections. It should therefore be clear  that  the  CEO  will  have  equal
powers to the Registrar only for the purposes of  section  12,  which  deals
with delegation and assignment of powers and duties. Section 13  deals  with
powers and inspections; section 14 deals with furnishing of  information  to
the Registrar; section 17  deals  with  penalties  for  failure  to  furnish
information to the Registrar; and section 18 deals  with  the  statement  of
the question of law for the opinion of the court. This means that  if  there
is a difference of opinion, the Registrar or the CEO  can  then  approach  a
court of law for clarity.

Presently, in terms of the Act, the Registrar may appoint a  person  who  is
not in full-time employment of the of state as a temporary inspector  for  a
particular inspection. With the proposed amendment, the Registrar,  as  well
as the CEO of the regulatory institution, such as the  one  we  are  dealing
with presently, approved as such by the  Minister  of  Trade  and  Industry,
will have the ability to appoint persons other than civil servants to  carry
out inspections on a continuous basis and not on a  temporary  basis  as  it
was before.

Therefore, we have no doubt that the Usury Amendment Bill  will  go  a  long
way in liberating the poor of our country from the shackles of  the  godless
and highly exploitative unregistered moneylenders. It  is  so  because  both
the Department of Trade and Industry and the MFRC will work hand in hand  to
deal a blow to moneylenders who do not want to comply  with  the  provisions
of the law.

We also want to indicate  to  this  House  that  this  Bill  is  an  interim
measure. The department will later on table a Bill in this Parliament  which
will deal decisively with these types of situations.  In  the  meantime,  we
want to beseech this House to adopt the  Usury  Amendment  Bill  before  us.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution

             SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY PROTOCOL ON
                 POLITICS, DEFENCE AND SECURITY CO-OPERATION

                (Consideration of Report of Select Committee)

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson  and  colleagues,  at  the  Southern  African
Development Community summit meeting held in  August  1999,  it  was  agreed
that the review  and  implementation  of  the  SADC  Protocol  on  Politics,
Defence and Security Co-operation should  form  part  of  the  general  SADC
review process. And at an extraordinary summit  meeting  held  during  March
2002, the summit agreed to the draft protocol finalised during October  2000
at Piggs Peak in Swaziland.  It  was  again  endorsed  at  an  extraordinary
ministerial meeting held in Harare on 11  June  2001  and  was  subsequently
signed in Blantyre, Malawi, on 14 August 2001. It  has  therefore  been  the
subject of a review process spanning approximately two years.

In the preamble to the protocol it is significantly stated  that  Chapter  8
of the UN charter, which recognises the role  of  regional  arrangements  in
dealing with matters relating to the maintenance of international peace  and
security, as are appropriate for regional action, is being  borne  in  mind.
Also that the  principles  of  strict  respect  for  sovereignty,  sovereign
equality,    territorial    integrity,    political    independence,    good
neighbourliness, interdependence, nonagression and  noninterference  in  the
internal affairs of other states are being recognised and reaffirmed.

The general objective of the protocol is to promote peace  and  security  in
the region, while the specific objectives are the protection of  the  people
and the safeguarding of the development of the  region  against  instability
arising from the breakdown of law and order and  intrastate  and  interstate
conflict and aggression.

It will also promote political co-operation  among  member  states  and  the
evolution of common political values and institutions  and  the  development
of common foreign policy approaches on issues  of  mutual  concern  and  the
advancement of such policy collectively  in  international  fora,  while  it
will promote regional co-ordination and co-operation on matters  related  to
security and defence and establish appropriate mechanisms to  that  end.  It
also seeks  to  promote  the  development  of  democratic  institutions  and
practices within the territories of  member  states  and  to  encourage  the
observance of universal human rights as provided for in the charters of  the
African Union and the United Nations respectively.  But,  most  importantly,
it will seek to prevent,  contain  and  resolve  interstate  and  intrastate
conflict by peaceful means. However, where such  means  prove  unsuccessful,
the protocol provides that the chairperson, acting  on  the  advice  of  the
Plenary Ministerial  Committee,  may  recommend  to  the  SADC  summit  that
enforcement action in accordance with international law and, as a matter  of
last resort, be taken against one or more of the disputant parties.

Any decision to intervene should be  made  in  the  context  of  the  common
defence pacts underpinning both SADC and  the  African  Union  while  regime
change will not be deemed a valid motivation for nonpeaceful  action.  There
will obviously always be the requirement that member states observe and  are
encouraged  to  implement  United   Nations,   African   Union   and   other
international conventions and treaties  on  arms  control,  disarmament  and
peaceful relations between states. The protocol shall, furthermore,  develop
close co-operation between the police and state security services of  member
states to address  cross-border  crime  and  to  promote  a  community-based
approach to domestic security.

The broad intent of  the  protocol  is  to  achieve  solidarity,  peace  and
security within the SADC region through close  co-operation  on  matters  of
politics,  defence  and  security,  the  emphasis  being  on  the   peaceful
settlement  of  disputes  by  negotiation,   conciliation,   mediation   and
arbitration. It is  therefore  obvious  that  Article  11,  with  the  title
Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution, and  which  spells  out  the
obligations, jurisdiction, methods and procedure to ensure  the  maintenance
of peace and stability, preferably through  peaceful  means,  is  the  focal
point of the protocol.

The importance of peace and stability in the  Southern  African  Development
Community region and on the African continent as a whole, as a  prerequisite
to sustainable  development  and  to  the  ongoing  consolidation  of  South
Africa's democracy and the expansion of our commercial interests, cannot  be
overemphasised and should not be underestimated.

The protocol should be viewed  against  the  background  of  South  Africa's
ongoing  commitment  to  and  its  role  in  creating  conditions  for  good
governance in the region and beyond.

Considering South Africa's  status  as  the  region's  and  the  continent's
economic powerhouse with our GDP  being  five  times  higher  than  that  of
Egypt, which is the second  on  the  list  in  Africa,  and  South  Africa's
concomitant  capacity  for  contributing  significantly   towards   regional
initiatives, it is our duty to set an example to other SADC states and  pave
the way for implementation of the protocol. While  there  are  no  penalties
for noncompliance, South Africa's commitment to the tackling of issues  more
decisively should encourage commitment from the other member states.

The Chief State  Law  Adviser  scrutinised  the  protocol  with  a  view  to
possible conflict with South Africa's domestic law.  In  his  opinion  there
appears to be no such conflict. It was also found in order  from  the  point
of view of international law.

I have already mentioned that the member  states  ratification  process  had
been a lengthy one. This was necessary to deliberate well on  the  sensitive
issues and to create a  climate  of  confidence  and  commitment,  which  is
pivotal to the successful implementation of the protocol.

Chairperson, it is  my  honour  and  privilege  to  request  this  House  to
recommend the ratification of the protocol. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the Report be adopted.

 PROTOCOL RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PEACE AND SECURITY COUNCIL OF
                              THE AFRICAN UNION

                (Consideration of Report of Select Committee)

Mr B J TOLO: Chairperson and members, Africa is a continent that  has  never
been at peace with itself, even after the formal withdrawal  of  its  former
colonisers. These we all know left a legacy that haunts us to this day.  The
interstate and intrastate conflicts on the continent,  the  coups  d'  état,
counter coups d' état and other forms of undermining of democracy,  even  by
elected governments, are a very serious cause for concern on our continent.

This can best be illustrated by the following  facts.  Since  1989  national
armies have directly intervened in the political affairs of  13  sub-Saharan
countries. Nigeria alone has more  coups  than  any  other  country  in  the
world. The 10-year old war in Burundi has brought untold sufferings  to  the
people of that country. In the DRC, the 4-year old  civil  war  has  claimed
about 2 million lives. These and other conflicts on the  African  continent,
be it in Sudan, Cameroon,  Angola,  Liberia,  Cote  d'Ivoire  or  any  other
place, have denied Africans, especially women and children,  a  decent  life
with human dignity.

These conflicts have  caused  death,  hunger,  displacement  and  any  other
sufferings. These conflicts  are  and  will  continue  to  be  a  fetter  to
development in our continent. Peace and stability, as we are all  aware  of,
is a  prerequisite  for  any  meaningful  development  in  any  country,  or
continent for that matter. The historic mission of  Africa,  indeed  of  its
leaders under today's conditions, is to rid the continent of  all  negatives
that have made the world look down upon it so that as  a  continent  it  can
take its rightful place among other continents in  the  world  as  an  equal
partner.

If we have to realise the dream of an African  Union  as  contained  in  the
Constitutive Act and the lofty ideals of Nepad, Africa has  to  act  and  it
has to act now. It is for this reason that the decision was  taken  for  the
establishment of the Peace and Security Council,  as  adopted  by  the  76th
ordinary session of the OAU Council of  Ministers  in  Durban  in  June-July
last year. It was further recommended to the assembly  of  heads  of  states
and governments of the OAU for adoption.

The establishment of the Peace and Security Council will be a  milestone  in
the development of African politics. The Peace and Security Council will  be
a standing decision-making organ of the AU responsible for  the  prevention,
management and resolution of conflicts on the African continent.  This  will
be done through the promotion of peace, security and stability with the  aim
of preserving  life  and  property  and  creating  conditions  conducive  to
sustainable development on the entire continent.
Unlike the organs of the OAU, which more often than not have  been  reactive
in solving African problems,  this  organ  seeks  to  be  proactive  in  its
operations. This will be realised through the formation of an early  warning
system,  which  will  be  composed  of  units  which  are  skilled  in  data
collection and analysis. This will help to detect problems in time  for  the
PSC to act in a manner that will seek to prevent the outbreak of conflicts.

We must hasten to indicate that this organ is not going to  be  a  law  unto
itself,  as  it  will  perform  its  functions  within  the  parameters  and
principles enshrined in the Constitutive Act and the Charter of  the  United
Nations  and  the  declaration  of  human   rights.   The   conditions   and
circumstances which  will  lead  to  the  intervention  by  this  organ  are
contained in the Article 4(h) and Article 4(j) of the Constitutive Act,  the
first of which reads as follows: ``The right of the Union  to  intervene  in
Member State Pursuant to a decision of the  Assembly  in  respect  of  grave
circumstances namely, war, crimes, genocide and crimes  against  humanity''.
That is the first condition, 4(h). Then I quote 4(j): ``The right of  Member
States to request intervention from the Union in order to restore peace  and
security''.  Otherwise  this  organ  will  respect   the   sovereignty   and
territorial integrity of all its member states.

The problem we have had so far in Africa is that  if  a  conflict  situation
erupts in any country and there is a need to send in some troops  to  either
quell a rebellion or for peacekeeping purposes, there is  no  force  at  the
ready to immediately deal with the situation.  The  African  countries  will
then take time to react, because they still have to  take  some  contingents
through crash courses  to  be  equal  to  the  task.  In  the  meantime  the
situation deteriorates and the people die.

To avoid this the protocol envisages the formation of  an  African  stand-by
force composed of stand-by  contingents  with  both  civilian  and  military
components stationed  in  their  respective  countries.  These  forces  will
always be combat ready and  ready  for  rapid  deployment  whenever  a  need
arises. Among  the  functions  of  this  force  will  also  be  humanitarian
assistance in conflict and  nonconflict  areas,  such  as  where  there  are
natural disasters. We have in mind the situation that erupted, for  instance
the floods that attacked Mozambique at some stage, where we had SANDF  going
there. We are saying such forces will be  able  to  perform  such  tasks  as
well.

We think it  will  be  an  appropriate  arrangement  to  have  these  forces
stationed in their own countries and ready to act at any given time,  unlike
the idea by Comrade Lever, who said  we  need  to  have  a  permanent  force
stationed  somewhere  in  Africa.  The  protocol   further   envisages   the
establishment of the Panel of the Wise. It will  consist  of  five  men  and
women who have  made  outstanding  contributions  to  the  calls  of  peace,
security and  development  on  the  continent.  These  will  be  drawn  from
different regions of the continent to allow for representativity.

This panel will advise the PSC and its chairperson on all  matters  relating
to peace and stability on the continent. They  will  further  on  their  own
also undertake missions in Africa to support the efforts of peace  and  will
report to the PSC. We think this will further  add  value  to  the  PSC,  in
particular, and the work of the AU in general.

In conclusion, the founders of Nepad have put their fingers in the pie  when
they said ``long-term conditions for ensuring peace and security  in  Africa
require policy measures to address the political and social  vulnerabilities
on which conflict are premised.'' We  suggest  that  this  House  adopt  the
protocol as it stands.  It  may  have  some  inaccuracies,  but  nobody  can
dispute the fact that it  is  indeed  a  milestone  in  addressing  Africa's
problems.

Dr E  A  CONROY:  Agb  Voorsitter  en  kollegas,  die  protokol  wat  vandag
gedebatteer word, stel die stigting van 'n Vredes-  en  Veiligheidsraad  van
die Afrika-unie in die vooruitsig. Ek sal verder  in  my  toespraak  na  dié
raad as die VVR verwys.

Die VVR sal die staande besluitnemende liggaam vir die  voorkoming,  bestuur
en oplossing van konflikte in die jurisdiksiegebied van die AU wees.

Die meganisme vir konflikvoorkoming, konflikbestuur en  konflikoplossing  is
in  die  konteks  van  die  Lusaka  Besluit  tydens   'n   werkswinkel   van
ambassadeurs en die Nepad-implementeringskomitee van 18 tot  22  Maart  2002
op George in die Suid-Kaap bespreek.

Na verdere besprekings van 'n konsepprotokol oor 'n VVR wat  soortgelyk  aan
dié van die VN sal wees en  in  noue  samehang  met  dié  wêreldliggaam  sal
funksioneer, wat in Mei 2002 in Addis Ababa plaasgevind het, het  die  76ste
gewone sessie van die Organisasie van Afrika-eenheid se Raad  van  Ministers
wat in Junie en Julie 2002 in Durban gehou is, die besluit vir die  stigting
van die VVR geneem.

Daar word spesiale nadruk geplaas op die behoefte aan vroeë  waarskuwing  en
voorkomende diplomasie ter ondersteuning van die protokol  se  breë  mandaat
en die inwerkstelling daarvan.

Hierdie mandaat sluit in die reg  van  die  Afrika-unie  om  onder  erge  en
gewigtige  omstandighede,  asook  in  gevalle  van  oorlogsmisdade  en   van
menseslagting en misdade teen die mensdom, in lidlande in te gryp.

Die mandaat sluit ook die reg  in  om  op  versoeke  van  lidlande  vir  die
doeleindes  van  die  herstel  van  veiligheid  en  vrede  in  te  gryp.  Sy
hooffunksie sal vredesuitbouing en na-konflik heropbou en herstel wees.

Die VVR  mag  ook  optree  in  gevalle  waar  die  nasionale  veiligheid  en
onafhanklilkheid  van  'n  lidland  deur  dade  van  buitelandse  aggressie,
insluitende dié met behulp van huursoldate, bedreig word en  sal  humanitêre
optrede  onder  omstandighede  van  gewapende   konflik   of   ramptoestande
koördineer en fasiliteer.

'n Afrika bystandsmag sal gestig word ten einde die VVR in staat te stel  om
sy  verantwoordelikhede  ten  opsigte  van  vredesondersteuningsmissies   en
omstandighede van ingryping uit te kan voer. Die  mag  sal  bestaan  uit  'n
multidissiplinêre bystandskontingent asook siviele  en  militêre  komponente
wat vir vinnige ontplooiing in hul onderskeie  lande  van  oorsprong  gereed
staan. Dit sal van lidlande verwag word om vir hierdie doel voorsiening  vir
die skepping van bystandskontingente te maak.

Vir sover dit die verhouding  met  die  VN-veiligheidsraad  betref,  is  dit
opmerklik dat die VVR ten nouste met die VN handves verbonde  is  en  daarop
gerig is om uitvoering te gee aan hoofstuk sewe  van  die  Handves.  Hierdie
hoofstuk maak daarvoor voorsiening dat niks in die Handves die  bestaan  van
streeksooreenkomste of streeksagentskappe wat  vir  die  instandhouding  van
vrede en veiligheid verantwoordelikheid aanvaar, teëstaan  of  verbied  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson and colleagues, the protocol that  is  being
debated today proposes the establishment of a peace and security council  of
the African Union. I shall refer in my speech to this council as the PSC.

The PSC will be  the  standing  decision-making  body  for  the  prevention,
management and resolution of conflicts in the area of  jurisdiction  of  the
AU.

The mechanism for conflict  prevention,  conflict  management  and  conflict
resolution was discussed in the context of  the  Lusaka  Decision  during  a
workshop of ambassadors and the Nepad Implemenation Committee from 18 to  22
March 2002 in George in the Southern Cape.

After further discussions about a draft protocol on  a  PSC  which  will  be
similar to that of UN and will function  in  close  co-oporation  with  this
global body, which took place in May 2002 in Addis Ababa, the 76th  ordinary
session of the Organisation of African Unity's Council  of  Ministers,  held
in Durban in June and July 2002, took a decision for  the  establishment  of
the PSC.

Special emphasis is placed on the need for early  warning  and  preventative
diplomacy in support of the protocol's broad mandate and  the  setting  into
operation thereof.

This mandate includes the right of the African Union to intervene in  member
states under serious and significant circumstances, as well as in  cases  of
war crimes and of genocide and crimes against humanity.

The mandate also includes the right to intervene at the  request  of  member
states for the purposes of the restoration of safety and peace. Its  primary
function will be  peace  expansion  and  post  conflict  reconstruction  and
restoration.

The PSC may also act in cases in which the national safety and  independence
of a member state is threatened by acts  of  foreign  aggression,  including
those  with  the  assistance  of  mercenaries,  and  will  co-ordinate   and
facilitate humanitarian activities under conditions  of  armed  conflict  or
disasters.

An African back-up force will be established in order to enable the  PSC  to
be able to exercise  its  responsibilities  with  regard  to  peace  support
missions and situations  of  intervention.  The  force  will  consist  of  a
multidisciplinary  back-up  contingent  as  well  as  civil   and   military
components standing by for swift deployment in  their  respective  countries
of origin. Member  states  will  be  expected  to  make  provision  for  the
creation of back-up contingents for this purpose.

As far as the relationship with the UN Security Council is concerned, it  is
noteworthy that the P0C is closely connected with  the  UN  Charter  and  is
aimed at giving expression to chapter seven of  the  Charter.  This  chapter
provides that nothing in the Charter opposes or  forbids  the  existence  of
regional agreements or regional agencies  which  accept  responsibility  for
the maintenance of peace and security.]

Deputy Chairperson, also pivotal to the  successful  implementation  of  the
protocol would be a commitment  among  all  member  states  to  intelligence
sharing which,  noting  the  sensitivity  of  the  issues  concerned,  would
require a climate of confidence.

Meetings in member  states  where  the  ratification  of  the  protocol  was
discussed seem to indicate that these states do not have problems  with  the
protocol as such, but due to  its  wide-ranging  requirements,  ratification
processes are subject to  more  national  consultations  than  usual.  They,
however, appear to be fully committed to the Peace and Security Council.

The State Law Advisers have studied the draft protocol and find it  in  line
with international law and South  Africa's  international  obligations.  The
Chief State Law Adviser has also scrutinisd  the  protocol  and  is  of  the
opinion that it is not in conflict with South Africa's domestic law.

The New National Party supports the  principal  content  and  goals  of  the
protocol on the establishment of the  Peace  and  Security  Council  of  the
African Union and supports its ratification. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M J BHENGU: Thank you. I thought you were denying me the right to  speak,
Deputy Chairperson. The evolution  of  security  frameworks  in  Africa  has
shown a very haphazard pattern, so much so that it is somehow  difficult  to
predict what the future could hold.

We all remember that there was a  time,  for  instance,  when  the  Southern
African Development Community (SADC) was seen as the leading  light  in  the
area of co-operative sub-regional security and  it  was  assumed  that  this
body would actually serve as a good example to the rest of the continent  on
how to manage and deal with sub-regional security challenges.  However,  all
the prospects for co-operation within SADC seem to have been jettisoned  and
other sub-regional groups such as Ecowas overtook the region.

One of the arguments made for a move towards regional security  arrangements
in Africa was the nature of the conflicts in Africa  itself.  It  has  often
been argued that in the last decade almost all the conflicts in Africa  have
been instrastate, but with a lot of spillover effects. This means that  even
though wars  were  fought  within  Angola,  Sierra  Leone  and  others,  the
resulting problems associated with war would not only affect  the  countries
that were directly involved, but even their neighbouring states as well.

It was envisioned that states could more easily cope with the challenges  of
refugee flows and the proliferation of arms when they co-operated with  each
other. In essence, the move towards more  regional  co-operation  in  Africa
was  a  result  of  perceived  common  sub-regional  security  threats   and
challenges.

Strong regional  security  arrangements  reflect  the  existence  of  strong
states underneath, and without  this  any  arrangement  entered  into  would
remain nothing but a hollow shell. Now, one  of  the  challenges  that  have
faced most African sub-regional groups is that  they  exist  within  a  weak
state system and this has actually affected their functioning.

Unlike Europe's development of  identity  and  statehood  over  decades  and
decades, Africa's colonial  heritage,  combined  with  the  difficulties  of
transition that followed independence and the cold war,  has  brought  about
enormous  disparities  in   political,   economic,   linguistic,   judicial,
institutional and administrative cultures within a relatively  short  period
of time. In such a situation, the key challenge  therefore  becomes  how  to
bring about commonality at a regional level and a  shared  understanding  of
challenges within states, which  were  formed  under  different  conditions,
particularly during the colonial period.

Therefore, when looking at the trends in peace and security in  Africa,  all
of the above-mentioned points have to be considered. It is important for  us
to contribute now at this point in time to the promotion of peace,  security
and  stability  in  Africa,  in  order  to  guarantee  the  protection   and
preservation of life and property, the well-being of the African people  and
their environment, as well  as  the  creation  of  conditions  conducive  to
sustainable development.

Therefore, in accordance with section 231(2)  of  the  Constitution  of  the
Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996, I propose that this  protocol  be
supported. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms C S BOTHA: Thank you, Chairperson. Central to the debates we have had  in
this Chamber is the  vision  of  an  African  Renaissance.  Many  peripheral
arguments have been heard around the exact meaning  of  this  phrase.  I  am
content to accept it as an affirmation of the dignity of every  human  being
and the efforts needed to achieve this goal.

South Africa's thrust towards this unity in action is not only the  idealism
behind it, but also the raft of plans put into a coherent  framework  around
which this ideal will be achieved, and the persistence  with  which  it,  in
the form of the AU and Nepad,  has  been  promoted.  The  concept  has  been
convincingly conveyed to parties in the rest of the world, like  the  G8  on
whose capital its success hinges.

It is in the past century  that  we  have  seen  the  rise  of  multilateral
decision-making bodies in world affairs, first,  in  the  formation  of  the
League of Nations, which was the brainchild  of  the  former  South  African
premier, Jan Smuts, followed  by  the  UN.  We  are  also  experiencing  the
inherent fragility of such bodies when a  member  state,  like  America,  is
able to act unilaterally. It is likely that this will also be  the  template
of the AU, which is composed of states and governments of  vastly  differing
capacities.

This should not be a reason for relegating it to  the  back  burner.  It  is
simply necessary to accept that the establishment  will  probably  not  take
years but decades. It is only necessary to look at the EU  and  the  immense
efforts that have gone into its formation - which is still ongoing - to  see
our own efforts in context.
The protocol under discussion, which will establish the Peace  and  Security
Council to be as the standing  decision-making  organ  for  the  prevention,
management and resolutions  of  conflicts,  has  a  very  wide  mandate.  It
includes the monitoring of good governance, the rule of law, the  protection
of human rights and fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian  law
as part of its early warning system and responsibilities.

The council has the option of responding to requests  by  member  states  to
intervene in restoring peace and security. It also implies the  need  for  a
co-ordinated armed force that can respond to crises  on  the  continent  and
intervene in member states  to  prevent  genocide,  war  crimes  and  crimes
against humanity.

Will this mean  that  this  council  can  intervene  to  support  a  failing
dictatorship? Will the same option be exercised when civil society  in  that
country asks for help? The council and its Panel of the Wise must  have  the
courage to make politically unpopular decisions and  be  willing  to  defend
these at home.

Who are the nations that will yield this power? The union's 53 members  will
select 15 members of the security council for a 2-year term, while the  five
regional chairs will be elected for a 3-year term.  There  is  no  provision
for veto rights or permanent seats on the council.

So far, South Africa and Gabon seem to  have  secured  two  seats.  Algeria,
Egypt and Libya are fighting for the Northern African seat, while  Ethiopia,
Kenya and Tanzania are competing for the  East  African  seat.  Nigeria  and
Senegal will contend for the West African seat. Each nations's  relationship
with the US, the EU and France may greatly  influence  which  countries  get
selected for the five seats.

There are serious questions to be  asked,  about  whether  the  AU  and  its
structures will not in practice be watered down to  accommodate  the  lowest
common denominator of authoritarian and  mismanaged  African  countries.  We
are not operating in a vacuum. The blatant refusal to  acknowledge  horrific
abuses when and where  they  occur  like,  presently,  in  our  neighbouring
country, Zimbabwe, does not evince confidence in the ability  of  states  to
adhere to the fine sounding principles of the AU.

This indicates that there is a special role for the  media  and  parliaments
to keep a  watchful  eye  on  these  developments.  And,  there  is  a  very
important role  for  multiparty  democracy,  which  ensures  that  differing
viewpoints are constantly highlighted and interrogated to  ensure  the  most
favourable route towards a particular goal.

The operational requirements of the AU and specifically  of  its  Peace  and
Security Council necessitates ceding measure of authority  and  sovereignty.
This is conceptually acceptable if we view South Africa as dominant  in  the
decision-making  bodies.  Considering,  however,  that  it  may   be   other
countries in  Africa  which  dominate  the  AU,  we  must  exercise  extreme
vigilance.

Participating heads of state and governments of the member states of the  AU
have agreed to work together in pursuit  of  democracy  and  good  political
governance. But the existence of  several  countries  in  conflict  and  the
obvious rivalry, which has clearly manifested itself, makes it of  paramount
importance that we fully interrogate the implications.

It is essential that we adhere to very specific  guidelines  for  action  on
all levels of  operation  and  be  transparently  clear  on  the  political,
financial and other implications of our  acceding  to  the  requirements  of
these measures.

A Pan-African security body charged with keeping the peace on the  continent
will be confronted with problems of no lesser complexity  than  those  which
beset the UN Security Council. Therefore, we should  not  take  lightly  the
consequences of  our  chosen  path,  which  is  to  support  this  protocol.
[Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA: Mr Chairperson, hon members, our President, Thabo  Mbeki,  in
his 2002 address to Parliament spoke of  the  need  for  African  ownership,
where African leaders had to accept openly and unequivocally that they  will
play  their  part  in  ending  poverty  and   bringing   about   sustainable
development. ``We must,'' he said, ``strengthen democracy on the  continent;
entrench a human rights culture, end  existing  conflicts  and  prevent  new
conflicts.''

One of the instruments that would clearly strengthen the hand of the  AU  in
defining our vision for peace on the continent is the protocol  establishing
the Peace and Security Council of the AU. The functions  of  the  Peace  and
Security Council will include  early  warning  and  preventative  diplomacy,
peace-making and peace-support operations.

Its mandate, according to the Constitutive Act, will include  the  right  of
the AU to intervene in member states  in  respect  of  grave  circumstances,
genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity,  as  other  members  have
already said. It may also respond to requests by member states to  intervene
in restoring peace and security and its  primary  function  will  be  peace-
building   and   post-conflict   reconstruction.   It   will   ensure    the
implementation of  the  AU,  UN  and  other  international  conventions  and
treaties on arms control and disarmament.

It  will  also  co-ordinate  and  harmonise  continental  efforts   in   the
prevention  and  combating  of  international  terrorism  in  all  respects,
develop a common defence policy  and  for  the  Union,  in  accordance  with
Article 4(d)  of  the  Constitutive  Act.  Moreover,  it  will  promote  and
encourage democratic  practices,  good  governance  and  the  rule  of  law,
protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for the  sanctity  of
human life as part of its efforts for preventing conflicts.

As far as the composition of the Peace and Security  Council  is  concerned,
which is provided for in Article 5,  we  are  confident  that  the  rigorous
deliberations  that  preceded  the  resolutions  ensured  us  with  a   fair
dispensation. It is envisaged that the Assembly shall take into account  the
principles of  equitable  regional  representation  and  rotation  and  that
membership shall be premised on equality.

Besides the requirements for membership contained in Article  5,  additional
criteria were set, namely,  actual  participation  in  peace-making,  peace-
building and conflict-resolution at regional and continental levels and  the
willingness to take responsibility for such  initiatives.  Members  will  be
subject to periodical  review  to  ensure  that  they  are  fulfilling  such
criteria.

In terms of its structures, the Peace and Security Council will also have  a
Panel of the Wise, which would comprise of  five  highly  respected  African
personalities from various segments of societies who have  made  outstanding
contributions to advance the cause of peace,  security  and  development  on
the continent.

They  shall  be  selected  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  Commission   after
consultation with the member states concerned,  on  the  basis  of  regional
representation and  appointed  by  the  assembly.  It  also  seeks  for  the
establishment of an African stand-by force in order to enable the Peace  and
Security Council  to  perform  its  obligations  and  responsibilities  with
respect to the  deployment  of  peace  support  missions  and  interventions
pursuant to Articles 4(h) and (j) of the Constitutive Act.

In conclusion, we are by no means assured of a permanent  peace  for  Africa
even if democratic governance  becomes  more  widespread,  but  we  are,  at
least, assured of the promise of peace, given the  winds  of  optimism  that
are blowing over the continent.

Just last week we witnessed the signing of the peace agreement of  the  DRC,
which was based on the common vision  and  a  firm  conviction  by  all  the
protagonists that they have a pressing duty  to  eradicate  poverty  and  to
place their countries on a path of sustainable growth  and  development.  In
essence this is what the Peace  and  Security  Council  is  all  about;  the
ability to implement mechanisms  consistent  with  the  vision  set  out  in
Nepad. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  That  concludes  the
debate, I shall now put the question, and the question is  that  the  report
be adopted. I now allow the parties to make their declarations  if  they  so
