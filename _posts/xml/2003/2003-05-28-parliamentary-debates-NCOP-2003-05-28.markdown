                                    ____

              PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                                    ____

The Deputy Chairperson took the Chair and requested  members  to  observe  a
moment of silence for prayers or meditation.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chair, I hereby give notice that I shall  move  at  the  next
sitting of the House:


     That the Council -


     (1)    notes that -


         (a)     inflation in Zimbabwe has soared to 269%, and  is  expected
              to reach 500% by Christmas;


         (b)     the effect, inter alia, is that a single  onion  now  costs
              Zim$250 and a single tomato, or a cheap toilet roll, more than
              Zim$100 making life  impossible  for  starving  pensioners  in
              particular, and the public generally;


         (c)      recent  academic  research  shows  that  the  failure   in
              Zimbabwe has had a negative impact of more than  1%  on  South
              Africa's economy, costing some 70 000 jobs here; and


         (d)     Zimbabweans are now in the majority  in  certain  areas  in
              the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in South Africa  which
              are within 100 km from the border with Zimbabwe; and


     (2)     calls  upon  the  South  African  Government,  before  Zimbabwe
         descends into complete chaos, to make it obvious, loud  and  clear,
         that as a matter of urgency, President Mugabe must step  aside  and
         allow  properly  supervised  fresh  elections,   leading   to   the
         reconstruction of Zimbabwe.

                FIRST BLACK AFRICAN TO CONQUER MOUNT EVEREST
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with unadulterated joy that  on  the  50th  anniversary  of  the
              conquest  of  Mount  Everest  by  Sherpa  Tensing  and  Edmund
              Hillary, a Mpumalangan Game Ranger,  Sibusiso  Vilane,  became
              the first Black African to  repeat  the  feat  and  scale  the
              summit of the highest mountain peak in the world; and


       (b)  that Mr Vilane was part of  an  international  team,  comprising
              eight members from the UK, the Netherlands, the United States,
              Canada, Norway and Mexico;


  (2) believes that all South Africans, indeed  all  Africa,  rejoice  with
       Vilane and his family on the victorious achievement of this  singular
       honour;
  (3) further notes that Mr Sibusiso Vilane steps up the podium to  receive
       the nation's applause and becomes yet another African role model  for
       the youth to admire and emulate;


  (4) however, also notes, with sadness and disappointment, the news of the
       flight to Swaziland of Vilane's wife and children because  his  house
       at Bungani Lodge, Mpumalanga,  has  been  burnt  down,  allegedly  by
       neighbours jealous of his newfound fame,  causing  damage  worth  R10
       000; and


  (5) condemns such a mindless act of meanness and madness by  the  alleged
       perpetrators.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: I would recommend that we move the  following
amendment:


  That the following paragraph be added after paragraph (3):


  (4) wishes to support  the  words  of  our  President,  namely  that  all
       Africans stand 8 832 metres tall;

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -

              conquest  of  Mount  Everest  by  Sherpa  Tensing  and  Edmund
              Hillary, a Mpumalangan Game Ranger,  Sibusiso  Vilane,  became

       perpetrators.

          KILLING OF MOTORISTS BY CAR HIJACKERS IN MITCHELLS PLAIN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns the senseless killing  of  motorists  by  car  hijackers  in
       Mitchells Plain;


  (2) notes that the murder of the  latest  victim  by  car  hijackers,  Mr
       Togeed Jacobs, comes barely a month after comrade  Reggie  Oliphant's
       death at the hands of car hijackers;


  (3) offers its sincere condolences to all victims of violence and crime;


  (4) assures the family that the hand of justice will ease their pain; and


  (5) calls upon the communities of Mitchells Plain and  elsewhere  to  co-
       operate with the police by identifying  these  murderers,  so  as  to
       ensure that the law takes its appropriate course.
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I had a motion similar to the one Mr Raju  has
just moved.

                 MIRACLE BABY BORN AT GROOTE SCHUUR HOSPITAL

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and  commends  the  Groote  Schuur  hospital  doctors  for  the
       successful delivery of a baby girl named Nonhlanhla, who was born out
       of her mother's uterus last Tuesday;


  (2) further notes that extra-uterine pregnancies carried to term  are  so
       rare that this one is the 15th documented case  worldwide,  and  only
       the 4th lucky one to survive;


  (3) pays tribute to Dr Bruce Howard, the specialist  in  the  gynaecology
       and obstetrics ward and a team of various specialists and doctors who
       worked together to perform  such  an  outstanding  Caesarean  section
       delivery; and


  (4) further congratulates the mother and the family for this miracle baby
       of the century, who has stunned not only doctors but also the country
       as a whole.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       NONCOMPLIANCE WITH HIGH COURT ORDER REGARDING RWANDAN REFUGEES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms L JACOBUS: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern that according to the Sunday  Times  article  over
       the weekend, there has been non-compliance with the Durban High Court
       judgment ordering both the Minister of Home Affairs  and  the  acting
       Director-General Mr Lambinon to  issue  two  Ruwandan  refugees  with
       refugee identity cards;


  (2) notes further that South Africa is a signatory to the United  Nations
       Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol, which
       was signed on 14 September 1995, which requires that we offer  asylum
       and  protection  to  neighbours  fleeing  the  ravages  of  war   and
       degradation;


  (3) expresses dissatisfaction with the abnormally high  number  of  court
       challenges that face the department  of  Home  Affairs,  particularly
       with regard to our treatment of foreigners coming to our country; and


  (4) appeals to the department of Home Affairs to double  its  efforts  to
       apply the laws in accordance with our Constitution and in  compliance
       with the applicable international instruments.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
         EMPATHY WITH THE PEOPLE OF ALGERIA FOLLOWING AN EARTHQUAKE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) empathises with the people of Algeria in  their  time  of  grief  and
       sorrow, resulting from the earthquake in which  2   200  people  were
       killed last week;


  (2) notes that yesterday morning another tremor was experienced  in  that
       country;


  (3) offers its sincere condolences to the families of all the victims  of
       the earthquake; and

       and rescue services.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                       LANGUAGE POLICY FOR PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van -


       (a)  die positiewe standpunt wat al die partye  teenwoordig  in  die
             Gesamentlike Reëlskomitee ingeneem het oor die  noodsaaklikheid
             van 'n taalbeleid vir die Parlement, en wel in die lig van  die
             Nasionale Plan en  Raamwerk  vir  Tale  wat  deur  die  Kabinet
             aanvaar is;


       (b)  die waarde wat hierdie Raad toevoeg en die  erkenning  wat  die
             Raad ontvang vir die leidende rol wat gespeel word ten  opsigte
             van die bevordering van veeltaligheid in die  Parlement  en  in
             die algemeen; en


       (c)  die popularisering van vier belangrike  wetsontwerpe  deur  die
             Parlement in die vorm van elektroniese en gedrukte  kopieë  vir
             omvattende verspreiding; en


  (2) van mening is dat -


       (a)  dié stap geskiedkundig is en die koers aandui aangesien die vier
             dokumente in al elf amptelike tale beskikbaar is -  dit  is  'n
             eerste vir die Parlement; en


       (b)  dit 'n aanduiding is dat die Parlement nie 'n  behoefte  het  om
             enige amptelike taal in die Parlement af  te  skaal  nie,  maar
             eerder om alle amptelike tale tot hulle reg te laat kom.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

Mr A E van Niekerk moved without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  the positive position taken by all the parties  present  in  the
              Joint Rules Committee regarding the necessity  of  a  language
              policy for Parliament and in fact in the light of the National
              Languages Plan and Framework, that has  been  adopted  by  the
              Cabinet;


       (b)  the value that this Council adds and  the  acknowledgement  that
              the Council receives for the leading role that is being played
              with regard to the promotion of multilingualism in  Parliament
              and in general; and


       (c)  the popularising of four important Bills by  Parliament  in  the
              form  of  electronic  and  printed  copies  for  comprehensive
              distribution; and


  (2) is of the opinion that -


       (a)  this step is historic and leads the way as  the  four  documents
              are available in all eleven languages - this is  a  first  for
              Parliament; and


       (b)  this is an indication that Parliament does not have the need  to
              scale down any official language in Parliament, but rather  to
              allow all official languages to come into their own.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                  PRECEDENCE TO SECOND ORDER ON ORDER PAPER

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL:  Chairperson,  I  move  without  notice  that
Order No 2 on the Order Paper be given preference to  Order  No  1.  I  have
duly consulted with the party-political Whips. I have  also  conferred  with
the hon the Minister of Trade and Industry who has no objection  to  such  a
request. Thank you.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        EXCHANGE CONTROL AMNESTY AND AMENDMENT OF TAXATION LAWS BILL
                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Hon  members,  before
we proceed, please note that we are in receipt of  correspondence  from  the
Minister of Finance,  indicating  that  the  following  textual  corrections
should be made to the Bill as printed: One, that the  word  "or"  in  clause
10(1)(b)3 on page 9, line 33, be replaced by the word "and". Two,  that  the
words "failed to confirm"  in  clause  10(1)(c)  on  page  9,  line  34,  be
replaced by the word "confirm". I now call upon the  hon  Taabe  to  address
the House.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson, the hon member was not aware  of
the fact that the orders would be changed, but he  will  be  here  within  a
second or two.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  somebody
ready to make a statement on that Bill other than Mr Taabe, so that  we  can
proceed?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy  Chairperson,  the  intention  of  the
amended legislation is to give consideration to indemnity for  those  people
who had taken money abroad prior to 1994 - large investments that were  made
by persons of South African origin. This legislation  enables  the  persons,
upon making appropriate declarations and disclosures that such  moneys  have
been taken abroad, to bring such moneys back into the country. A fine  or  a
levy, in the form of 5% of such moneys, would be imposed on people who  wish
to return or bring back the money into the country of origin, that is  South
Africa. In the event of such a citizen wishing to retain investment  abroad,
an amount of 10% would be levied on the investment.

The nature of the piece of legislation is such that it also makes  provision
for a disclosure of assets and these assets could also be valued.  In  other
words, if they are not in liquid form  -  that  is,  it  is  a  house  or  a
building that has been acquired abroad - then assessment would  be  made  of
the value of any improvement, and the levy would be imposed accordingly.

May I add that the  select  committee,  when  it  considered  the  piece  of
legislation, was in receipt of the textual corrections  that  were  proposed
by the Speaker in the National Assembly, and they  had  due  regard  to  the
matter when they supported the Bill.
I have also drawn the attention of the various party-political Whips to  the
nature of the textual corrections that have been made, and I thank them  for
their understanding and their support. I  have  done  my  best,  considering
that I haven't even served on the committee to be  able  to  deal  with  the
piece  of  legislation,  which  I  have  hardly  scrutinised   or   perused.
[Laughter.] Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Declarations of vote:

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, as the Minister knows, over the  past  years  in
the committee and  in  this  House,  I've  been  recommending  the  exchange
control amnesty, and thus it would be  churlish  of  me  not  to  thank  the
Minister and his department for this Bill and for the work done. I think  it
is well-crafted and I agree with everything that  the  Chief  Whip  so  well
put.

However, there is a problem with clause 11 of this Bill, which  I  will  ask
the Minister to please give attention to. The Chief  Whip  mentioned  a  few
principles regarding this Bill, and some of them are:  One,  a  fresh  start
for all taxpayers, which coincides roughly with  our  new  worldwide  taxing
provisions; two, allowing  people  to  legalise  their  investments  in  tax
affairs, which has the benefit of bringing those tax  investments  into  the
tax net.

However, there is another principle, one of consistency. A  person  who  has
invested, say, £30 000 in bonds or equities will pay, say, £3 000 or £1  500
to regularise their affairs. A person who, on the other hand,  has  put  £30
000 into a property of, say, £300 000 with  the  £275  000  mortgage,  would
have to pay £30 000 pounds on the whole value of his investment  to  achieve
the same objective. How will that person raise an additional £30 000?

I think it is something we need to  look  at,  because  I  believe  the  net
effect will be that people will simply  not  disclose  because  they  can't.
They won't be able to raise the total amount of the value of the money  that
they had taken offshore. The fiscus will be the loser  in  that  the  rental
income for tax purposes will not come into the net in the future.  The  main
loser will be the person who will continue with his illegal tax stature.

Simply, we support the Bill. We support  the  measure,  and  it  is  a  good
measure. We ask the Minister to look at that. Maybe he can deal with  it  in
the regulations. I thank you.

Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, the DA supports this Bill in  principle.  But,  and
the Minister is well aware, we consider it to be crafted in such  a  fashion
that it won't achieve its  aim  as  well  as  it  may  have.  Therefore,  we
abstain. Thank you.

Bill, with textual corrections, agreed to in accordance with section  75  of
the Constitution (Democratic Alliance abstaining).

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy Debate)

Vote No 32 - Trade and Industry:

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND  INDUSTRY:  Chairperson,  MECs,  hon  members  and
ladies and gentlemen, last year we presented the budget  of  the  DTI  in  a
manner that was specific to the NCOP, as part of  our  effort  to  make  co-
operative governance a reality. This was successful  and  we  are  going  to
repeat it again today.

The provinces will focus on the developments in their provincial  economies,
the Deputy Minister  will  focus  on  the  DTI  group  of  agencies  in  the
provinces and I will deal with some of the challenges that we  face  in  co-
operative governance, making it a constitutional ideal and  transforming  it
into an operational reality.

Our biggest challenge as a government  remains  addressing  the  inequitable
distribution of and access to economic  power  and  resources.  Co-operative
governance is an important instrument to  address  these  inequalities.  Co-
operative governance, which is enshrined in Chapter 3 of  the  Constitution,
enables effective delivery  of  services  and  achievement  of  Government's
strategic objectives through integrated  planning  and  budgeting  processes
across all three spheres of government.

You will note that I said "spheres" and  not  "tiers".  Quite  clearly,  the
term  "tiers"  has  far  too  much  of  a  hierachical  tone  to   it,   and
``hierarchy'' does not reflect the spirit of co-operative governance.
The developmental challenges that confront us as a  country  require  a  far
more equal and co-operative relationship between the  different  spheres  of
government. This is what we, in the Department of Trade  and  Industry,  and
our counterparts at provincial and local government levels,  are  trying  to
achieve.

We have  mastered  the  art,  I  believe,  of  constructive  and  productive
interactions. Through fora such as provincial heads of department  meetings,
MinMecs and  our  annual  provincial  lekgotla,  we  have  created  a  solid
foundation  for  effective  engagements  with  provinces.   To   take   this
interaction to a higher level, the DTI  has  introduced  new  mechanisms  of
working with the  provinces  and  local  government  through  clustering  of
provinces rather than visiting each  province  on  a  monthly  basis.  I  am
pleased to report that  the  executive  board  of  the  DTI  had  the  first
provincial visit of this nature last week, which proved, I believe, to be  a
success.

At local government level, the DTI has structured  interaction  through  the
SA  Cities  Network,  an  initiative  spearheaded  by  the   Department   of
Provincial and Local Government. Some  of  the  people  who  attend  the  SA
Cities Network and who  attended  our  provincial  lekgotla  last  year  now
attend provincial HOD meetings.

As part of strengthening relations with local government,  I  had  a  second
very successful meeting with executive  mayors  in  December  2002.  We  are
thinking through how we  extend  this  interaction  to  the  rest  of  local
government, and in this regard we would  like  to  work  more  closely  with
Salga, the SA Local Government Association.

For us co-operative governance has  become  a  reality.  The  coherence  and
alignment that we have between talking about over the past few years is  now
more concretised. National, provincial and local government, I believe,  now
talk the same language.  We  share  a  common  vision  of  the  economy.  As
Government we are all working towards an adaptive economy  characterised  by
growth, employment and equity, built on a full  potential  of  all  persons,
communities and, I stress, geographic areas. We have achieved  agreement  on
how to attain that vision by the year 2014.

Over the past 12 months  we  have  come  together  as  national  Government,
provinces and cities to deliberate  on  Government's  economic  vision,  the
Microeconomic  Reform  Strategy  and  the  DTI's  Integrated   Manufacturing
Strategy, or IMS. The IMS, which was released a  year  ago,  emphasises  the
need for strong partnership between all spheres of government.

The  implementation  of  the  IMS  requires  customised  sector  programmes.
Working closely with provinces is essential,  as  industrial  promotion  and
trade  promotion  are  concurrent  responsibilities  between  national   and
provincial governments. We have taken many steps to localise the  Integrated
Manufacturing Strategy, including  making  presentations  to  provinces  and
cities. Provinces have since  initiated  reviews  of  their  own  industrial
strategies, and we welcome the alignment that has emerged  between  the  IMS
and the provincial strategies, particularly the prioritisation  of  sectors.
I would, of course, urge hon members to have a close look  at  the  exhibits
outside, where, I think, you will  see  some  very  fascinating  enterprises
beginning to form, which are the embodiment of the Integrated  Manufacturing
Strategy.

There has also been extensive interaction with metros on  the  IMS.  The  SA
Cities Network has held workshops on localising the IMS, and we welcome  the
research that is being conducted by cities  to  identify  their  competitive
potential.

Local economic development and provincial growth and development  strategies
are  focused  on  developing  sustainable  competitive   advantages.   These
strategies reflect an abandoning of  the  traditional  and  less  productive
approach  of  attracting  investment  through  competing  on   packages   of
susbsidies, free land, cheap  infrastructure  and  services  that  have  led
mostly to a race to the bottom  for  municipalities  through  eroding  their
revenue base and constraining the  provision  of  basic  services  to  their
communities.

A shared vision is, however, only the starting point. We need to  find  ways
of translating this vision into  tangible  programmes  that  will  make  our
vision a reality and bring fundamental change in the quality of life of  our
people.

But, where  does  responsibility  for  actual  delivery  lie?  There  is  no
straightforward answer to this question. To state that  national  Government
is responsible for policy and  that  provinces  and  local  governments  are
responsible for implementation,  is  overly  simplistic.  Economic  citizens
require a package of services which include elements such  as  land  zoning,
environmental impact  assessments,  investment  incentives,  market  access,
company registration and information on business opportunities.

Each sphere of government has a role to play in delivering this  bouquet  of
services. We  need  to  work  together  closely  to  ensure  efficiency  and
responsiveness in providing these services. An investor from Germany  or  an
entrepreneur from Kimberley does not really care which  part  of  government
is responsible for what; he or she sees only  one  government.  We  need  to
work on joint delivery strategies.

There are many important areas where we as national,  provincial  and  local
government are working  together  as  partners.  The  Deputy  Minister  will
address the initiatives taken by members of the DTI  group  to  ensure  that
service delivery occurs throughout South Africa's provinces.

Logistics infrastructure is at present a matter  of  critical  concern  with
regard to the competitiveness of our economy, and we  are  working  on  this
matter with KwaZulu-Natal  and  Gauteng  provinces.  During  our  provincial
cluster  meeting  last  week,  we  spent  two  days   discussing   logistics
infrastructure. We visited  Durban  and  had  a  presentation  by  the  Port
Authority, followed by a site visit to the City Deep Container Terminal  the
next day.

Industrial Development Zones are an embodiment  of  co-operative  governance
between the three spheres of government. These  industrial  estates,  linked
to international ports or airports, leverage investment  in  export-oriented
industries and  are  attracting  sufficient  foreign  direct  investment  to
stimulate  both  local  and  regional  growth.  The  designated   IDZs   are
progressing, and we are learning  valuable  lessons  as  this  programme  is
rolled out. This will inform our thinking about any  future  IDZs,  such  as
the investment requirements  in  infrastructure  and  appropriate  financing
mechanisms and institutional arrangements for those IDZs.

A  significant  investment  incentive  has  been  the  Strategic  Investment
Programme.  This  programme  seeks  to  raise  levels  of   private   sector
investment  in   innovative,   profitable   and   wealth-creating   business
enterprises   in   South   Africa,   while   simultaneously   creating   job
opportunities within the industrial sector. Ten projects have been  approved
thus far, attracting investment of R2,97 billion. The provinces where  these
SIPs are located are Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga,  the  Western  Cape
and the Eastern Cape. So we are beginning to get a spread of these  critical
projects.

We are working with each province to develop and grow priority sectors  such
as: agroprocessing in Limpopo and Mpumalanga; clothing and textiles in  KZN;
pharmaceuticals in the Free State; the film industry in  the  Western  Cape;
call centres in Gauteng; autos in  the  Eastern  Cape;  and  mining  in  the
Northern Cape and North West. These are some examples of  concrete  projects
currently  taking  place.  Closer  collaboration  between   our   investment
promotion agencies is also essential in this regard.

Enterprise development remains an important area of co-operation across  all
three spheres of government. In order for our economy to grow  in  a  manner
that will create decent work for entrants into  the  labour  market,  it  is
necessary that new enterprises are created and  that  existing  ones  become
more competitive. The Manufacturing Advisory Centres are a  very  successful
example  of  what  we  can  do  together  to  support  small   manufacturing
enterprises, and this is the reason we have more than tripled  their  budget
in this financial year. If you look outside, in particular  at  the  Gauteng
exhibit, you will see some of the planning  and  designing  work  of  GauMac
(Gauteng Manufacturing Advice Centre). All provinces are  beginning  to  use
this facility more and more.

We need  to  work  together  to  implement  Government's  broad-based  black
economic empowerment strategy. We need to support  the  development  of  co-
operatives, and we need  to  work  together  to  carry  out  this  important
function. The select committee has highlighted  co-operatives  as  an  issue
that is important to them  and  the  DTI  will  be  sharing  its  draft  co-
operatives development strategy with provinces at our next MinMec in July.

At a local level, the relationship between cities and provinces  presents  a
particular challenge to co-operative governance.  Cities  have  considerable
resources and represent 80% of South Africa's manufacturing  activity.  This
is a global trend, yet huge disparities exist within cities.  I  think  here
of Sandton and Alexandra, or of Camps Bay and  Khayelitsha.  In  Tshwane  we
have an urban core, surrounded by  an  inner  periphery  where  40%  of  the
population lives, but contributes 91% of the economic output.  There  is  an
outer periphery in the North West, which is home to 60% of  the  population,
but only contributes 9% to the economic output.

It is important to  maximise  the  opportunities  for  economic  growth  and
social development that are offered by these emerging global  city  regions.
The advantages have to be developed in a manner  that  will  ensure  a  more
equitable  spread  of  resources  and   wealth.   It   is   our   collective
responsibility to make this happen.

Let  me  say  that  we  are  slightly  concerned  at  the  proliferation  of
development agencies. At the last count we had 54 such  agencies,  reporting
to one or other department or city. I think we will need to do a little  bit
of streamlining in this area.

Another major challenge that confronts us in  our  pursuit  of  co-operative
governance lies within the domain  of  regulation.  The  regulation  of  the
liquor  and  gambling  industries,  as  well  as  consumer  protection,  are
concurrent  responsibilities  between  national,  provincial  and,  in  some
dimensions, local government. Over the past nine years  we  have  vigorously
debated the question  of  where  the  national  responsibility  of  ensuring
common standards and promoting alignment  behind  national  policies  begins
and where it ends.

In the areas of gambling and liquor, it is recognised by both  national  and
provincial governments that effective regulation  is  critical  to  ensuring
that proper control over the industry is exercised in  order  to  limit  the
potential social costs in the form of problem gambling and drinking  and  to
maximise the benefits that can be derived from these industries in the  form
of  economic  empowerment,  employment  creation,  revenue  generation   and
infrastructure development.

Concurrent jurisdiction has  the  potential  to  result  in  less  effective
control over a regulated industry, owing  to  inconsistency  in  legislation
and uneven enforcement across provinces, creating regulatory gaps  that  can
be exploited by the industry.

The impact of uneven enforcement  capacity  across  provinces  can  also  be
demonstrated in the area of  consumer  protection.  A  lengthy  process  was
adopted by the national and provincial governments in 1996 for provinces  to
adopt legislation  similar  to  the  National  Consumer  Affairs  Act.  Most
legislation  was  successfully  harmonised,  owing   to   the   constructive
relationship  between  national   and   provincial   governments.   However,
provincial laws make provision for consumer courts, which are  tribunal-like
structures that assist with the resolution  of  complaints  about  local  or
provincial  businesses.  But,  to  date  only  three  consumer  courts   are
operational.

A similar situation is expected to occur in respect  of  liquor  legislation
once the new Liquor Bill has been adopted  by  both  Houses  of  Parliament.
Unless there are provincial laws in place, or  default  legislation  as  was
proposed, it is conceivable that the new Liquor Bill will be in  place  long
before  all  provincial  laws  are  passed,  creating  the   potential   for
regulatory gaps.

In the area of gambling, the differences in legislation  and  administrative
processes between provinces are particularly pronounced in respect of  horse
racing. Here the licensing processes, licensing costs,  levels  of  taxation
and types of bets allowed vary between provinces, creating confusion in  the
industry. In addition, the type and level of inspection provided for in  the
different pieces of legislation  varies,  resulting  in  uneven  degrees  of
enforcement and control across provinces.

Thus  concurrent  jurisdiction  brings  with  it  a  number  of   regulatory
challenges, ranging from the need for more effective co-ordination, and  the
need to harmonise legislation and administrative processes, to the need  for
the elimination of duplication, as well as the need for consistent and  even
enforcement action across provincial boundaries.

It requires a very  strong  relationship  between  national  and  provincial
governments that is based  on  the  common  goal  of  upholding  the  public
interest. It means that both Houses of Parliament, the portfolio and  select
committees in particular,  must  play  an  active  role  in  monitoring  and
oversight to ensure that some of the problems outlined above do not occur.

The DTI will soon submit a new Gambling Bill to this Council that will  seek
to clarify some of the challenges and areas of concern outlined  above.  The
Liquor Bill similarly seeks to clarify  the  relationship  between  national
and provincial governments. However, here the role  of  national  Government
is  clearly  limited  by  the  Constitution  and  the  Constitutional  Court
judgment. The role of the select committee in  ensuring  that  some  of  the
concerns raised at the recent public  hearings  on  the  Liquor  Bill,  with
respect to  the  challenge  of  formalising  the  illegal  operators  and  a
consistent approach across  provinces,  is,  therefore,  critical.  I  would
submit that we are going to have a busy second half of  the  year  in  which
the NCOP, in this economic area, will have to  play  a  very  critical  role
indeed.

As we work towards a common set of objectives,  synchronise  our  programmes
and   adapt   our   legislation,   efficient   information-sharing   becomes
imperative. We have  made  progress  in  this  regard  through  our  regular
meetings, but we need to find more innovative ways  of  sharing  information
on investment projects in provinces  and  cities,  upcoming  investment  and
trade missions, developments in market access  or  trade  negotiations,  and
even changes in personnel within our departments.

The  development  of  a  management  information  system,  to  underpin  and
facilitate co-operative governance  for  economic  growth  and  development,
must be a priority for our departments over the next 12 months.

As the DTI, we need to be able to reflect on  your  provincial  efforts  and
achievements at national  Cabinet  meetings,  particularly  the  six-monthly
Cabinet makgotla. We welcome the participation of  some  of  the  provincial
heads of department in the economic and employment cluster. This is  useful,
and we enjoin more  provinces  to  follow  their  lead.  This  is  quite  an
interesting development, where the national clusters have participants  from
the provinces.

Another information challenge relates to statistics and data  on  provincial
and  local  economies.  This  is  something  that  many  of  our  provincial
colleagues have raised with  the  DTI.  Within  the  DTI  we  are  currently
upgrading our own capacity for statistical analysis, and  we  need  to  work
together to develop  a  more  comprehensive  statistical  picture  of  South
Africa's economic landscape. Again, this should be a  priority  as  we  move
forward.

I hope  that  I  have  illustrated  the  extent  to  which  DTI  values  the
importance  of  co-operative  governance.  It  is  core  to  our  manner  of
functioning. For us co-operative governance is not  limited  to  interaction
between the three constitutional spheres of government alone,  but  includes
our relationship with this legislature.

I would like to take  this  opportunity  to  thank  members  of  the  select
committee for their continued hard work. Under their new  chairperson,  who,
I think, has taken over extremely well, they have interrogated  Vote  No  32
and the DTI's Medium-Term Strategy Framework.

I would also like to thank my colleagues in the provinces for their  ongoing
co-operation and willingness to work together, and I  believe  that  we  are
truly building "Team DTI". My  thanks  to  Deputy  Minister  Hendricks,  who
deserves recognition today for her tireless efforts,  as  do  the  director-
general and his dedicated staff in the DTI.

Before I conclude, I want to do a little bit of marketing for the DTI's  new
information centre across the road, on the 6th floor of 120 Plein Street.  I
urge members to make full use of this resource. I am going to embarrass  all
of  you  fairly  soon  by  naming  the   people   who   have   been   there.
[Interjections.] As regards those who have not been there, I shall  write  a
note to  their  constituencies  saying  that  they  are  not  interested  in
economic development.

So with that  bit  of  threatening  marketing,  the  DTI's  budget  of  R2,6
billion,  as  presented  before  this  Council  today,  represents  a  large
investment by the state in our country's economic  growth  and  development.
By working more closely together, building on the solid foundation  that  we
have  put  in  place,  we  can  leverage  a  much  greater  return  on  this
investment. This is the essence of co-operative  governance.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

[Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and  Deputy  Minister,  hon  members  in  the
House and those from the provinces, the director-general of  the  department
an  all  the  honoured  guests  who  are  here  today,  I  want  to  express
appreciation for the time  afforded  me  to  convey  my  humble  opinion  on
today's discussion.

You will realise, Chairperson, that today's discussion  is  very  important,
because it  concerns  the  lives  of  South  Africans  in  general,  without
exception. Without economy there is no life.]

On 27 April 1994, millions of our people - black and white  -  went  to  the
polls to choose a party or an organisation  to  entrust  with  the  task  of
reconstructing this country after many years  of  apartheid  colonialism.  A
big majority of our people elected the ANC as  a  suitable  organisation  to
fulfil this mammoth task. That mandate was renewed  in  1999.  That  is  the
organisation I am mandated to speak for this afternoon.

Since that day,  when  the  ANC  was  elected,  this  organisation,  through
Government, has never looked back. Since 1994 millions of  people,  some  of
whom had till then shared water with animals,  now  have  clean  water.  The
question of water supply may be taken for granted by  some  of  us  who,  on
waking up from youth's ignorance, found themselves with tapped  water.  That
is not the case for many of our people out there, especially  in  the  rural
areas.

Between 1994 and 2002 more than 3  million  South  African  households  were
electrified. Some of these people never  dreamt  of  having  electricity  in
their homes in their lifetime. None other than an ANC-led  Government  could
have made this possible.

The commitment of  Government  to  overcoming  the  legacy  of  homelessness
cannot be questioned by anybody. We have put a roof over the heads  of  more
than a million families in the period under review.

We did not only roll back the frontiers of poverty, to use  the  President's
words, but as a country we managed to occupy our rightful  place  in  Africa
and indeed amongst communities of nations  in  the  globalising  world.  All
these have been realised because our economy has been resilient  when  other
economies in the world were not able to withstand external shocks.
In 1994 we inherited an economy which was stagnant  and  near  collapse.  We
managed to turn  it  around  and  put  it  on  a  profound  footing  towards
sustainable growth and development,  thanks,  among  other  things,  to  the
leadership of Minister Alec Erwin and his deputy in the Department of  Trade
and Industry. The department has put its finger in the pie by  understanding
and focusing on the real needs of South Africans, which form  the  basis  of
the drive towards equity and sustainable development in the economy.

It  is  no  secret  that  prior  to  1994  economic  empowerment  and   real
participation in the economy depended on the colour of one's skin and  one's
gender. It meant,  therefore,  that  one's  specific  genetic  material  was
indeed a key to one's prosperity or lack thereof.  It  is  for  this  reason
that the department strives to realise black economic  empowerment.  We  can
report that only yesterday, our committee was briefed by the  department  on
the BEE strategy. And, of course, we can also report that a  Black  Economic
Empowerment Bill is already in Parliament and  we  will  bring  it  to  this
House soon.

Both the strategy and the Bill prove in no uncertain  terms  the  commitment
of the department and indeed of the Government to  realising  equity  within
the economy. These structural inequalities in the economy are  a  fetter  to
further future development of our economy, and we have to get  rid  of  them
if we are serious about real sustainable growth and development.

When we compare our economy with others of more or less the  same  size,  we
realise that ours has seriously improved in its  global  competitiveness  in
the past years and it is poised to  improve  further  in  the  near  future.
Manufacturing is said to be growing at a high rate.  It  has  exceeded  even
mining in its importance. This high growth rate was  given  impetus  by  the
automobile industry, which has grown tenfold in the year 2002.

According to the Bureau for Economic Research,  the  manufacturing  industry
grew by over 8% in 2002. And the fact that  the  manufacturing  industry  is
export-orientated is a plus for our economy.

The department has facilitated trade agreements with  several  countries  on
different continents. Trade with Africa alone in the year under  review  has
grown by 24%, which is good for Nepad. This, however, cannot  be  enough  as
we must strive to continuously expand our economy if we  are  serious  about
addressing the problems that face our people, such as  lack  of  sustainable
jobs.

The Department of Trade  and  Industry  has  a  very  broad  mandate,  which
includes the following: acceleration of economic  growth,  creation  of  new
employment opportunities and reduction of economic inequalities.

It is for this reason that the department has established and  enlisted  the
services of a number of institutions that are  collectively  called  Council
of Trade and Industry Institutions - COTI Institutions for  short.  Although
the majority of these institutions are, in our  view,  doing  an  invaluable
job, especially in the field of SMMEs, there  are  a  few,  such  as  Khula,
which we think are not up to scratch with  their  mandates  and,  therefore,
need to be re-evaluated. I think one of the  committee  members  will  at  a
later stage talk at length about this.

The procurement policy of the department is very, very clear,  as  it  seeks
to redress the imbalances of the past. This policy, in  the  spirit  of  co-
operative governance, must  inevitably  flow  to  the  provinces  and  local
authorities.  The  problem  is  that  certain  local  authorities  are   not
following this good policy. Is there anything that can  be  done  to  compel
all Government structures  in  all  spheres  -  I'm  also  using  "spheres",
Chairperson - of government to follow this good example? Is  there  anything
that we can do to see to it that the good policies that  are  formulated  by
this department cascade to the lower levels?

When the Minister addressed this House last year  on  his  Budget  Vote,  he
spoke at length about the  role  of  provincial  and  local  governments  in
relation to expanding the economy of our country. He spoke  about  the  need
for provincial governments to align  their  provincial  economic  strategies
with IDPs. Now that some MECs and special delegates are here today, we  hope
to  hear  how  they've  managed  to  align  their  plans  with   the   local
authorities'  plans  to  realise  greater  acceleration  in  the  growth  of
provincial  economies.  We  hope  to  hear  how  provinces  stimulate  local
economic  development  so  that  these  local  authorities  can  indeed   be
developmental in their nature.

We must also indicate that there is uneven development  in  respect  of  our
provinces. More often than not, real economic growth seems to take place  in
the already developed provinces such as  Gauteng.  Perhaps  they  have  more
affinity with investments. The rural provinces find it difficult to  attract
investments. Our wish is to see more equitable economic development  in  all
our provinces.

We think there is a need to be  biased  in  favour  of  rural  provinces  in
attracting investments. These provinces mainly  produce  raw  materials.  We
call upon them to redouble their efforts in  seeing  to  it  that  they  add
value  to  these  raw  materials.  Beneficiation  of  raw   materials   will
undoubtedly expand the provincial economies, thus creating  the  much-needed
jobs.

This department is clearly creating policies that  enable  and  will  enable
the economy to grow and to expand the market for our products and  services,
both internally and  externally.  We  commend  this  department  for  always
exploring new ways to  grow  the  economy  and  to  set  up  new  people  in
business. We are convinced, as a committee, that  this  department  has  its
priorities right and that its budget and all its  subprogrammes  are  geared
towards the realisation of their policies and priorities.

In conclusion, we want to congratulate the department  for  establishing  an
information centre - the Minister has already talked about that -  which  is
second to none in Government so far. That centre is here in Cape Town.

Only  yesterday,  the  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP  was  talking  about   the
possibility of  using  videoconferences  in  the  NCOP,  for  instance  with
provinces. We can report here today that as a  committee,  we  have  already
had  several  videoconferences  with  that  department,   using   the   very
facilities that they have. We can report that it is an exciting experience.

Our committee supports this Budget Vote unreservedly. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  members,
I've been informed by the Whip in charge of  the  speakers'  list  that  the
slot for speaker No 14 will be taken by speaker No 3 and that of speaker  No
3 by speaker No 4, in that order. I will, therefore, call upon the hon  T  A
Mufamadi, MEC  for  finance  and  economic  affairs,  Limpopo  province,  to
address the House.

Mr T A MUFAMADI (Northern Province):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon
Deputy Minister, special delegates and  permanent  delegates  to  the  NCOP,
colleagues, MECs and friends, perhaps I should start off by saying that  the
previous speaker has actually represented  rural  provinces  very  well.  Ke
laka leo hon Tolo [I agree with you hon Tolo].

I think the majority of us will recall that Limpopo as  a  province  started
in  the  gutters  of  hopelessness   and   despair,   epitomised   by   four
dysfunctional Bantustan  administrations.  Despite  these  difficulties,  we
chose to  focus  and  reach  for  the  stars  and  refused  to  give  in  to
hopelessness. Alone,  we  confronted  difficult  issues  of  rural  economic
development, with a very poor social and economic fiscal infrastructure.

In the quest for  socioeconomic  development,  as  a  government  and  other
stakeholders, we adopted  the  growth  and  development  strategy  to  align
ourselves with the National Growth and Development Strategy. We  did  so  in
1999.

One of the  three  objectives  of  the  provincial  growth  and  development
strategy is the facilitation of economic growth that  generates  employment.
The other pillars are the maintenance of infrastructure and the building  of
the administration.

In the year 2000 our economy as a  province,  for  the  first  time  in  our
history,  experienced  growth  in  employment.  This  positive  outcome  was
preceded by the growth of the  economy  at  an  above-average  rate  over  a
period of five years, and increased investment in the mining,  agricultural,
trade and tourism sectors.

All this started with the vision to grow the provincial  economy  to  become
the major contributor to the national wealth by the year 2020. It  is  still
our hope, our wish and our dream that by the year 2020 we will  be  a  major
national contributor to the national economy. Our  vision  is  supported  by
the mission to create and  sustain  an  environment  conducive  to  economic
growth, social justice and equity for all.

The provincial GDP was estimated at  R14  billion  in  1994,  to  which  the
community and social sectors contributed 32%. This was the  second  smallest
economy in the country. During the year  2001  Statistics  SA  reported  the
highest economic growth rate of 6,3% in Limpopo.  Therefore  we  became  the
fastest-growing economy in the country. In fact, Limpopo's economy  grew  to
R64 billion, which was more than four times its original size in 1994.

It is important to note  that  the  manufacturing  industry  increased  from
R1,83 billion in 1999 to R2,75 billion in 2001, which is a  growth  rate  of
about 50%. The wholesale, retail trade, and hotel  and  restaurant  services
doubled in  1995  from  R4,2  billion  to  R8,5  billion  in  2001.  Capital
investment of R4,3 billion, R5,2 billion and R6 billion occurred during  the
years 1998-99 and 1999-2000 respectively. The  leading  sectors  in  capital
investment were mining at R6,5 billion, community  and  social  services  at
R2,5 billion and the trade sector at R2,2 billion.

The key focus areas in the acceleration of our economy in  order  to  create
sustainable jobs are agriculture,  manufacturing  and  tourism.  The  growth
rates in both manufacturing and tourism industries no  doubt  have  positive
implications for job creation.

I need to mention at this point in time that to  align  ourselves  with  the
National Growth and Development Strategy, we have set  aside  an  amount  of
R20 million for irrigation schemes, to make sure  that  communities  in  the
far-flung areas of our provinces and our country are able to participate  in
the mainstream economy.

We have also set aside R30 million in the current  financial  year  for  the
sustenance of existing and the  formation  of  new  co-operatives.  We  have
already started discussions with our colleagues in the Northern  Cape  about
the Kalahari project, with the intention of ensuring that we also  begin  to
organise  communities,  particularly  local  communities,  to  be  the  real
beneficiaries of this project. We envisage the  project  to  also  take  the
form of a co-operative.

We want to place on record here that before  1994,  unemployment  levels  in
the province were growing at the rate of 16% per annum. By  1999,  the  rate
had decreased by 10%. In the year 2000 the Limpopo province realised  a  net
growth in employment, estimated at 1%. So  we  have  completely  turned  the
corner.

We could share more, time permitting. But, in conclusion,  we  want  to  say
that as a way forward, in order to optimise job creation as  the  provincial
government, we will be  spending  much  more  effort  and  concentrating  on
growing the  agricultural  and  agroprocessing  clusters,  the  tourism  and
construction industries as well as the development of the  mining  industry.
We, therefore, welcome the step and the  initiative  by  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry to encourage co-operative governance between and  amongst
all spheres of government, particularly provincial  and  local  governments,
in and around areas of investment initiatives and investment promotion.

We think it is important that the national department continues  to  support
spatial initiatives as envisaged and started by provincial  governments.  We
also want to take this opportunity to thank DTI,  under  the  leadership  of
the current director-general, because this department has  indeed  become  a
national department. It is not only visible, but we  have  started  to  feel
and touch it on the ground.

I am speaking on behalf  of  ordinary  citizens  of  our  province  in  this
regard, that ordinary emerging black entrepreneurs,  those  who  fall  under
the category of and qualify for black economic empowerment programmes,  have
begun to benefit directly from the programmes of DTI.
We also support your  programmes,  hon  Minister,  particularly  around  the
liquor industry, because we believe that they are not only in  the  interest
of the industry itself, but also in the  interest  of  those  who  had  been
historically marginalised from the mainstream economy. So we  are  part  and
parcel of your initiatives and as a province we support you fully in so  far
as they are concerned.

Lastly, we would like to thank and really congratulate the  Deputy  Minister
for being a champion of black economic empowerment and  SMME  programmes  in
our country. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr E RASOOL (Western Cape): Chairperson, Minister, Deputy  Minister,  fellow
MECs, colleagues  and  friends,  I  want  to  say  that  we  are  benefiting
tremendously  from  the  spirit  of  co-operative  governance  that  exists,
particularly between DTI and the provinces. I think that it  helps  us  even
further to drive that spirit of co-operative governance down  to  the  local
government level.

Already, I think that we have followed some examples, brought together  some
of the mayors of  the  Western  Cape  and  the  Exco  members  charged  with
economic development, and started to put certain milestones  in  place.  All
this narrows down to a microlevel intervention in  the  economy,  with  each
acting within their particular capacity to maximise the resources.  I  think
that is the right spirit. As the Minister says, it is not simply  about  who
does policy and who does implementation. I  think  that  there  is  such  an
interwoven approach to it that we have got to remain in touch  and  informed
all the time.

I think that the Western Cape joined the  growth  and  development  strategy
family fairly late, but we are driven by the desire to  make  sure  that  we
catch up and that in catching up, we do not learn  from  our  own  mistakes,
but from the mistakes of others.

When we put together the provincial budget earlier this year, we  introduced
the  concept  of  Ikapa  Elihlumayo,  literally  meaning  "the  growing  and
developing Cape". That is what  we  are  holding  out,  not  as  a  complete
product of the growth and development strategy, but as  something  to  focus
the debate on. It is also something that we are hoping,  during  the  growth
and development summit in the Western Cape later this year, to build  enough
consensus and strategies on, and add enough substance to is bare bones.
We see the  concept  of  Ikapa  Elihlumayo  (The  Growing  Cape)  as  a  key
mechanism to fulfilling not only the growth potential of the  province,  but
also to sharing the wealth that exists within this  province.  This  is  our
contribution to the Minister's vision  for  2014  for  the  economy  of  the
country, and we are hoping that we will be able to do that.

It is very clear Ikapa Elihlumayo underpins  the  kind  of  equity  outcomes
that are required to overcome the disparities that the Minister  has  spoken
about. A BEE conference that the Western  Cape  convened  last  week  had  a
tremendous impact,  I  think,  particularly  on  emerging  business  people,
entrepreneurs - black, white, disabled, women, small, and of all sizes.

I think that we have been able to  develop  a  consensus  that  for  us  the
equity outcomes that we need to develop are around,  essentially  employment
for our people;  empowerment  through  spreading  of  ownership  within  the
economy; SMME development as a key driver of our way forward; but  also  the
notion of  geographical  equality,  because  our  spatial  inheritance  from
apartheid is such that we have dormitory townships next to thriving,  viable
economic communities.

Therefore, I think that what we are trying do with Ikapa  Elihlumayo  is  to
use the spirit of co-operative governance  to  build  on  our  macroeconomic
stability and achievements;  to  make  a  transition,  very  quickly,  to  a
microeconomic  reform  strategy;  to  adopt  the  Integrated   Manufacturing
Strategy and to drive growth with an equity programme as we go forward.

We are also very conscious of the very great emphasis that you have  put  on
doing so in the real economy and not necessarily within  the  imagined  one;
not chasing growth sectors in other provinces  but  basing  it  on  our  own
strengths and our own  potential  within  the  Western  Cape.  For  example,
regarding tourism, we've invested public money in the  construction  of  the
Cape Town International Convention Centre that will  open  later,  and  that
will add to the number of leisure and ecotourists that come here.

The number of business tourists will increase with the number of those  that
come for conferences, conventions and incentives. We  think  that  the  Cape
Town International Convention  Centre  is  already,  before  it  is  opened,
before its first function, fulfilling the promise of bringing  a  very  high
yield, great turnover of convention-going tourists into the Western Cape.  I
think  that  we  are  basing  our  growth  on  those  kind   of   strengths.
[Interjections.]

I think the economy is so important that I would not want to join  in  cheap
point scoring. I think that what we also need to say is that there are  very
important sectors within the Western Cape. Some  remain,  unfortunately,  at
the primary level. For example, we need to  look  at  agriculture,  fishing,
forestry, and to turn them, through beneficiation, adopting elements of  the
Integrated Manufacturing Strategy through beneficiation, and push them  into
the secondary sphere of our economy. That way we will avert  the  many  eyes
that look at the sea, at packaging and processing,  those  kind  of  things,
and sending beneficiated products out of the country. The  same  applies  to
agriculture, fruit and vegetables.

I think that we need to consolidate some of our sectors. We  need  to  shore
them up and to turn them around. I am thinking of clothing and  textiles  in
particular. Since we had this debate last year,  I  think  we  have  entered
into very good co-operation  with  the  SA  Clothing  and  Textile  Workers'
Union. We have been able to bring in some of the key bosses in the  industry
and agreed on the basic strategies to start  protecting  the  industry,  not
through protective mechanisms, but through the developing of niche  products
for niche markets, positioning ourselves  for  agreements  which  have  been
made, such as the EU agreements, etc. I think those are the kind  of  issues
that we need to get involved in.

I think that part of  the  growth  sector  has  been  the  tertiary  sector,
particularly our ICT hub, business processing, a little bit  of  advance  on
the call centre industry and the financial services  sector.  However,  they
all require relatively high levels of skills and I think that  is  where  we
have been  caught  out  in  the  Western  Cape,  and  we  are  beginning  to
understand the need  to  invest  significantly  and  quickly  in  our  human
resource  development  strategy.  And  so  Ikapa  Elihlumayo  needs  to   be
underpinned by that kind of human resource development  plan,  and  I  think
that we are getting there.

There are some difficulties at the  moment  emerging  as  a  result  of  the
strengthening of the rand. Those who placed massive orders  last  year  when
the rand was relatively weak have had those orders cancelled. This  has  had
an impact on jobs, and on products not  going  out.  I  think  that  we  are
trying to work with some of these industries to make sure that  we  save  as
much as possible of the situation and that things look up.

I would want to say that one of the key challenges that we are facing  as  a
provincial government relates to the tools we have in order to drive  growth
with equity and to the leverages we have to achieve  equity  in  particular.
And if we were to look at it, the space that we  have  to  manoeuvre  within
our budget is probably related to the investment we make in infrastructure.

In addition to infrastructure, the other sector that we  invest  heavily  in
in the Western Cape is education; R5 billion, and we  believe  that  so  far
neither of them has given us  value  for  money  or  has  positioned  us  to
achieve the kinds of objectives that we need to achieve.

I think that Ikapa Elihlumayo as a strategy is about how we  start  shifting
infrastructure development in the kind of strategic ways  that  Stellenbosch
has directed us. How do we  start  the  process  of  turnaround  within  the
schooling system to develop the kinds of skills that  we  need  to  develop?
Those are the kinds of issues that we are very busy with.
We realise the importance of the confidence that government generates  where
it actually gets involved. I think that we have been amazed at  the  way  in
which we've taken hold of some of the issues involved in  the  film  sector.
The idea that we support the notion of a film city or a film  studio  within
the Western Cape has had the effect that a phenomenal number of  people  and
consortiums have come together in order to  bid  for  partnership  with  the
government. They use the confidence generated by the presence of  government
to turn an industry that is sprawling all over  the  streets  of  Cape  Town
into one that has direction. This way you can sort out the  empowerment  and
equity objectives and get them into a new phase of growth.

I think that we are beginning to understand how government at  a  provincial
level needs to use its  tools.  We  have  a  very  important  public-private
partnership agreement that we have just  signed  with  a  consortium  around
Chapman's Peak, which will be a boost for the tourism industry. I  think  it
has enormous short-term job implications.  It  opens  up  one  of  the  most
scenic routes to tourists  and  I  think  that  the  specific  mechanism  of
driving a public-private partnership is  beginning  to  yield  the  kind  of
fruits we want.
I want to end off by saying that at  the  end  of  the  day,  what  the  BEE
conference discovered was that the opportunities are beginning to  open  up.
Government legislation and mechanisms, such as score  cards  and  all  those
kinds of things, are beginning to create the opportunities for  our  people.
What we lack amongst those that have been historically disadvantaged is  the
notion  of  driving  entrepreneurship,  the  notion   of   real   enterprise
development amongst people. That is where we have decided that  we  need  to
intervene to create an enabling environment for real enterprise  development
and for entrepreneurship development if our  people  are  going  to  benefit
from the opportunities which  the  economy  is  beginning  to  open  up  for
everyone.

Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr A E DE WET (Eastern Cape): Deputy Chair,  hon  Minister  and  hon  Deputy
Minister, MECs, hon members, first, let me apologise for the absence of  our
MEC, the hon Enoch Godongwana. He is,  unfortunately,  engaged  in  an  East
London IDZ (industrial development zone) investment seminar  and  has  asked
me to stand in for him. It is with pleasure that I  present  his  speech  on
his behalf.
In the Eastern Cape we share the view that  the  South  African  economy  is
rooted in every village and town and in  every  city  and  province  of  the
country. The challenge of changing the economic  landscape  of  the  country
is, perhaps, nowhere more imperative than  in  the  Eastern  Cape.  Historic
distortions and inequities run deep in our  province  and  leave  trails  of
poverty, exclusion and unemployment in rural areas and  also  in  our  urban
areas.

Bringing about a new economic geography is, indeed a fundamental  challenge,
and we dare not waver with respect to this  responsibility.  The  provincial
growth  and  development  plan  and  the  research  and   development   work
undertaken by the Eastern Cape Development Corporation have charted the  way
forward.

The  imperative  to  focus  attention  on  the  development  of  the  former
Bantustan areas of our province forms the basis for planning  and  searching
for solutions, but we remain acutely aware of  the  critical  importance  of
the two major urban     agglomerations in the  province.  The  Buffalo  City
and Nelson Mandela urban areas are the engines  that  drive  the  provincial
economy.

The challenge is to ensure that the benefits of urban  ecomomic  growth  are
extended  to  rural  hinterland  through  productive  forward  and  backward
linkages that will stimulate primary production  in  agriculture,  forestry,
mining and fishing. The  key  lies  in  establishing  value-added  and  job-
creating processes, such as beneficiating and agribusiness enterprises.

The two industrial development zones in the  Eastern  Cape  represent  prime
opportunities  for  building  a  sound  basis   for   the   development   of
manufacturing that is supported by the  three  spheres  of  government.  The
role of Government in this respect is to invest in  critical  infrastructure
that  provides  an  operating  environment,  which  will  attract  and  keep
sustainable private-sector investment.

We have also ensured that the IDZ developments plan for and implement  clear
linkages with the  undertakings  of  the  urban  renewal  programme  in  the
Motherwell  and  Mdantsane  areas  of  Port  Elizabeth   and   East   London
respectively. Equally important is to ensure that developments in  the  IDZs
are extended to small business entrepreneurs, and  that  the  principles  of
black economic empowerment are overtly adopted as points of departure.
The Buffalo City Municipality and the Nelson Mandela Metro are part  of  the
SA Cities Network. Whilst we understand that the  process  is  still  in  an
early stage, we look forward to reaping the benefits  of  this  association,
particularly in terms of understanding how  large  cities  work,  how  their
transportation systems are integrated and how their finance systems  can  be
managed. Of principal concern in this respect, is coming to grips  with  the
challenges  of  forging  unified  cities  out  of  the  legacy  of  separate
development that has torn our cities  apart  into  artificial  group  areas,
which continue to affect city forms and flows.

Promoting  food  security  through  agricultural  programmes  is   a   major
consideration  in  the  Eastern  Cape,  and  these  programmes   have   been
established through extensive  investments  in  the  Integrated  Sustainable
Rural  Development  Programme  (ISRDP),  which  is  focused  on  four  nodal
district municipality  areas  in  the  north  and  eastern  regions  of  the
province. These developments depend on the extent  to  which  we  can  craft
real co-operative  governance  among  the  national,  provincial  and  local
spheres of government, the national and provincial public entities, and  the
private sector.
We are under no illusion about the physical and financial dimensions of  the
challenges that  are  involved.  We  believe  that  we  have  the  necessary
instruments to meet these challenges. The municipal  integrated  development
plans are  the  key  building  blocks  for  ensuring  that  our  development
endeavours are rooted in the needs of the  people.  Aligning  the  strategic
plans and budgets of the provincial government with IDP  plans  and  budgets
lies at the core of this approach. This is the  most  fundamental  challenge
of co-operative governance, not only  between  Government  departments,  but
more  importantly  between  provincial  government   departments   and   the
district, local and metro municipalities.

We  are  aware  of  the  growing  relationships  between  the  DTI  and  the
provincial government's department of  economic  affairs,  and  between  the
Department of Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  and  the  environment  and
tourism divisions of that  department.  However,  we  depend  on  access  to
information and well-judged policy formulation  to  guide  and  sustain  the
provincial economy, and we  look  forward  to  further  consolidating  those
relationships in the pursuit of  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  in
the Eastern Cape.

The Eastern Cape is poised to realise manufacturing development and  export-
related growth and employment. We will secure  the  key  objectives  of  the
Integrated Sustainable Rural Development Programme, and  the  urban  renewal
programme,  and  we  will  address  poverty  and  unemployment  amongst  the
majority of our people. We are proudly South African, and we will succeed.

However, there is another dimension that  affects  our  future  development,
and that is how we as South Africans project  ourselves  both  within  South
Africa and abroad. We are often our own worst enemy, projecting  a  negative
image of our country. There are still people that don't understand  that  if
they highlight crime as the  major  problem  of  South  Africa,  they  can't
expect  foreign  investors  to  think  otherwise.  Is  it  worth  the  cheap
political points, sending that message out to the world, when  we  can  deal
with these problems internally ourselves?

So, too, does the Eastern Cape suffer from  certain  perceptions.  It  seems
that our image of being the poorest province, where everything that  can  go
wrong does go wrong, clouds the reality. I would like to inform  this  House
today that  with  the  Coega  and  the  East  London  IDZ  having  moved  to
implementation at a rapid pace,  the  Eastern  Cape's  contribution  to  the
country's GDP will increase dramatically. I want to say,  "Ilanga  liphumile
eMpuma Koloni" - the sun is shining on the Eastern Cape.

We thank the hon Minister, the hon Deputy Minister  and  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry for their contribution. I  repeat:  We  are  proudly  the
Eastern Cape, we are proudly South African, and we will succeed. Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr H J BEKKER (KwaZulu-Natal): Mr Chairman, it  is  a  particular  privilege
for me to again address this Trade and Industry debate, although it  is  the
first time that I've done so in this august House. But I think  having  been
involved with trade and industry since 1994 has been a long spell.

An export-driven economy that emphasises the manufacturing industry is  what
this country  needs  in  order  to  create  essential  and  sustainable  job
opportunities.

Today we are indeed grateful that your efforts have  paid  off,  and  please
accept our appreciation and congratulations for steering our  economic  ship
in the right direction. The economic  growth  that  is  required  for  South
Africa in order to  sustain  the  population  growth  is  dependent  on  the
investment climate in our country. Massive international investment as  well
as internal investment, particularly in the  industry  and  in  tourism,  is
what  we  require,  and  economists  and  politicians  must  get  off  their
backsides and take up their respective responsibilities.

All of us know that  there  are  no  longer  international  restrictions  to
foreign investment in South Africa and that  investors  are  looking  at  us
favourably and with sympathy. Unfortunately, several of them shop around  in
South Africa with their notebooks, whilst keeping their  chequebooks  safely
locked away, mostly because of fear regarding the safety and  protection  of
their capital investment. The  greatest  deterrent  to  real  investment  in
South Africa is  what  is  perceived  by  them  -  and  I  say  specifically
perceived  by  them  -  as  violence,  criminality,  and  uncertainty.   The
Zimbabwean situation is still a scare crow, chasing away investments,  which
also has major implications for South Africa.

The question that should be asked is: What are we  doing  to  address  these
issues  and  what  are  we  as  politicians  doing  in  order  to  give  the
international  community  the  necessary  assurance  that  we   are   indeed
committed to stamping out violence, criminality and uncertainty?

Regarding the taxi recapitalisation programme, we wish the Minister and  his
colleague from transport all the best. They will need  all  our  support  in
the months to come. The Taxi Recapitalisation  Programme  must  ensure  that
the basic ownership  of  taxis  would  remain  with  small  enterprises  and
individuals, whilst caution must be taken that newly established groups  and
big business do not take over  or  compete  with  this  multifaceted,  small
business enterprise.

Substantial industrial development and job creation may occur  with  such  a
recapitalisation project, with the many  benefits  that  such  an  upgrading
project would  have  for  the  South  African  economy.  It  is,  therefore,
important  that  South  Africa  create  and  promote  an   acceptable   Taxi
Recapitalisation Programme.

However, in KwaZulu-Natal  we  also  realised  that  any  scheme  introduced
without proper and appropriate law enforcement will never be successful.  In
the long  term,  it  is  imperative  that  the  interests  and  concerns  of
stakeholders in the taxi industry, particularly  the  safety  of  commuters,
are taken into consideration. Obviously, Government  should  give  attention
and consideration to the concerns of all the relevant stakeholders, but  the
safety of the commuters must be our top priority.

In KwaZulu-Natal tourism is playing a major role  in  the  creation  of  job
opportunities. We are  proud  that  KwaZulu-Natal  has  two  world  heritage
sites. We are also proud of the other heritage  sites  in  South  Africa.  A
question arises: Should it be the provinces  that  promote  these  sites  or
should it be done at national level? My feeling is that  this  should  be  a
joint effort and jointly, as  national  Government  and  the  provinces,  we
should make a very special effort because I think that we still  lack  quite
a lot of expertise in promoting our world heritage sites.

Furthermore, in KwaZulu-Natal we have cultural and traditional splendour.  I
even read the other  day  that  the  area  where  one  can  go  for  extreme
adventure is the Arabi Gorge, which  is  the  highest  in  the  world.   For
anyone who is prepared to go and swing over the Arabi  Gorge,  that  is  now
possible.  These  are  the  types  of  things  that  bring   us   into   the
international arena.
The other aspect concerns the industrial development zones mentioned by  the
Minister. Richards Bay, of course, and the Empangeni area are two  of  these
areas that have been acted upon. But  we  should  also  look  at  where  the
planned King Shaka Airport and the Dube Port are to be situated.  Similarly,
the Durban port area, which is  fairly  dilapidated,  does  offer  fantastic
opportunities as an industrial development area.

Of course, the Minister and I have had a discussion on that  before  and  we
did not agree on my particular personal feeling, namely that we should  look
at export processing zones, with the possibility of special tax  concessions
in those particular areas. In that way, I believe, an area such as  Richards
Bay in particular, could indeed become a gateway to Africa and that  we  can
look at it as a Hong Kong of the future.

Just another interesting  aspect  -  has  anybody  thought  about  how  much
tonnage is being transported back to Mpumalanga with the coal trains?  I  do
not think that one single ton is being returned. It is all empty  trucks.  I
don't think it takes an extreme genius or an engineering genius  to  find  a
crane to lift containers. Our destination should be Africa,  it  would  help
the situation.

If one could have a situation in  which  one  could  have  an  inland  port,
particularly towards the Mpumalanga area where the coalfields are, and  from
there through central Africa and the eastern side of Africa.

If one were to focus on something which is not  as  positive,  the  Minister
mentioned that he has made a call on the port of Durban  as  well.  I  think
the overcongestion at Durban port is of great concern. The  question  arises
as  to  what  is  the  real  cause  of  this   particular   aspect   is   it
infrastructure, or is it a matter of low productivity?

And if one would look at the output figures  of  Antwerp  and  international
standards applied at ports,  then  the  performance  of  Durban  harbour  in
particular - I think this is also true of other ports in South Africa  -  is
way, way below what should actually be the norm over there.  It  is  no  use
that one invests so heavily in trying to  improve  infrastructure  if  one's
workforce is not prepared to work on it.

A shocking finding came to my attention the other day that the total  output
per worker since the negotiations started about  a  year  ago  has  actually
deteriorated instead of improving. So, therefore, one has  got  to  look  at
these issues very seriously  and  then  also  consider  the  aspect  of  the
privatisation of ports. Once we get there, one could get  the  international
know-how involved.

But, should that be the case, then one can also look  at  the  other  ports,
and we wish Nqurha well in this regard. It is not  that  one  wants  to  get
into competition with other ports around the country, but I  think  that  as
industrialists we must, at the end, look at  comparative  advantages;  where
can you benefit the most? If one can achieve that,  then  one  must  have  a
level playing field. One must bear in mind  that  in  South  Africa  certain
things are definitely skewed, for instance,  our  electricity  rates,  which
would be the same in Cape Town as in Mpumalanga itself.

Now, obviously one cannot ... one has got to aim for some kind of a  balance
in this respect. But if one looks at the total aspect, Mpumalanga  has  been
burdened with toxic waste, with everything related to  this,  but  they  are
not getting any benefits  from  this.  I  just  give  this  as  an  example.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Mr H J BEKKER: The KwaZulu-Natal  contingent  will  definitely  support  the
Budget Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M D RAMODIBE:  Chair  of  Committees,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  DG,
special delegates and colleagues, in 1994 we elected  South  Africa's  first
democratic Government with a mandate, as enshrined in the  Constitution,  to
redress the inequalities of the past and its political, social and  economic
imbalances. The historical imbalances left the majority  of  South  Africans
disempowered by denying them  the  right  to  develop.  Transformation  from
colonialism to freedom has political, social and economic implications.

When you live in a state of poverty  you  are  subjected  to  all  forms  of
unpleasant conditions. Firstly, your mind cannot  function  properly,  which
means then  that  your  ability  to  learn  becomes  weakened.  An  inferior
education system has devastating effects on skills,  particularly  technical
and scientific skills. This  also  prevented  blacks  from  taking  part  in
modernising industrial and commercial economy.

Allow me to quote Adam Smith in his 1776 edition: "No society can surely  be
flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of  its  members  are  poor
and miserable."

In his January 8 statement, the President  of  the  country,  Comrade  Thabo
Mbeki, said that in pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty,  an  important
task is  to  formulate  an  elaborate  economic  transformation  charter  to
accelerate   the   process   of   black   economic   empowerment   for   the
deracialisation of our economy as a matter of  urgency.  We  would  like  to
commend the Minister of Trade and Industry, together  with  his  department,
for having embarked upon comprehensive programmes to provide  a  legislative
framework for the transformation of our economy.

I have a few examples of pieces of legislation that helped  deracialise  the
South African economy and lay the foundation for broad-based black  economic
empowerment:  Restitution  of  Land  Rights  Act,  Preferential  Procurement
Policy Framework Act, National Empowerment Fund Act, Employment  Equity  Act
and the Competition Act.

The tendering process is made more  accessible  to  black  people.  Although
made accessible to blacks, one is still not  convinced  that  fronting  does
not take  place.  Lack  of  financial  resources  will  always  inhibit  the
capacity of our people to access these opportunities. Whether  the  intended
objective to reach the real targeted group is realised, is doubtful.

The  Competition  Act  is  about  increasing  the  number  of   historically
disadvantaged persons with an ownership stake in the economy.

The National Empowerment Fund is a trust that holds equity stakes in  state-
owned enterprises and other private enterprises on  behalf  of  historically
disadvantaged persons. The Finance Minister has set aside R10  billion  over
a five-year  period  and  this  will  be  channelled  through  the  National
Empowerment Fund.

Indeed, it is true that black economic empowerment is not a new  phenomenon.
However, the definition was too narrow and limited. What was  needed  was  a
comprehensive black economic empowerment strategy that  draws  together  the
various  elements  of  Government's  transformation  programmes  in  a  more
coherent and focused way. All  South  African  individuals  and  enterprises
will benefit from a more equitable economy, reducing income inequalities  so
that the majority of South Africans, particularly blacks, can contribute  to
economic  growth.  Underdeveloped  people  cannot  contribute  to   economic
growth.

Black economic empowerment also takes into account  the  principle  of  good
governance,  which  ensures  high  standards  of  co-operative   governance,
equality and transparency. We hope that with the introduction in  Parliament
of the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment  Bill  for  the  promotion  of
black empowerment, we will be able to interact and influence the Bill.

To measure progress, Government will use a score card. This will  provide  a
framework against which to benchmark the black economic empowerment  process
and other sectors. Licensing is guaranteed to engage  a  regulated  economic
activity, for instance  fishing.  Priority  must  also  be  given  to  women
because if you empower a man you empower an individual, but if  you  empower
a woman you empower a nation. [Interjections.]

Recruiting black people into management and  executive  positions  underpins
economic  stability  and  prosperity  and  promotes  human  dignity.   Black
economic empowerment is cross-cutting and, therefore, impacts  on  each  and
every department. It is not the responsibility of Trade and Industry  alone,
but that of Government as  whole.  Therefore,  there  will  be  a  need  for
interdepartmental work.

I  want  to  conclude  by  saying  that  as  I   have   already   indicated,
transformation has sociopolitical and  economic  implications.  It  involves
various  stakeholders.  Government's  intervention  here   is   crucial   to
addressing  the  exclusion  of  the  majority   of   South   Africans   from
participating in the economy. Therefore  the  ANC  supports  the  budget.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Thank you very much  member  Ramodibe.
We succeeded in this country by negotiations.  We,  again,  have  negotiated
with the Free State to give its slot to Mpumalanga. I  therefore  call  upon
hon member Mgidi from Mpumalanga to address the House.
Mr S G MGIDI (Mpumalanga): Chairperson, thank you very much.  This  strategy
of negotiations has taken our country to where it is today. I have no  doubt
that it will still take us further. Thank you, Free State.

As Mpumalanga we want to put it upfront,  without  clustering  it  with  our
input, that we support the Budget Vote of the  Minister  for  a  very,  very
simple reason, that since the Minister and  his  deputy  became  responsible
for this department all policies from year  one  to  date  have  shown  some
progressiveness and a need to change things for  the  better  and  improving
the lot of our people. We want to encourage them to keep it up.

As you would remember, the ANC-led Government,  soon  after  1994,  declared
and  indeed  acted  upon  its  declaration,  that  our  country  needed  new
innovative policy fundamentals. Many  sceptics  did  not  believe  that  the
Minister and his colleagues in the Economics Cluster had anything  to  hold,
anything progressive or anything that could  take  us  somewhere.  But  then
what became the result of those policies is that today our country, for  the
first time in many decades, is among those that boast better  management  of
the economy. There's no doubt about it. Nobody can question that.  Not  even
those who questioned those policies before.

Again, when our democratic Government pioneered and indeed conceptualised  a
noble idea of co-operative governance, not many, especially those who  don't
believe in innovative ideas, supported this  idea.  They  thought  that  the
intention here was to usurp  the  powers  of  the  provinces.  Indeed,  what
became of those policies is that our country today is  better  managed;  our
economy is even showing positive growth since then.  We  want  to  encourage
this co-operative governance.

Today those provinces whose delegates spoke  before  me,  KwaZulu-Natal  and
the Eastern Cape, with which as Mpumalanga we share  the  characteristic  of
being very rural in nature, would want to encourage the  Minister  to  stick
to the policy of moving towards supporting those rural provinces even  more,
the way we did with the policies that were never tried before. I  think  our
direction towards these rural areas is going to yield positive results  very
soon.

Our Government  and  indeed  our  provincial  government,  have  shown  some
commitment, which is unwavering, for the  betterment  of  the  life  of  our
people. And as Mpumalanga  we  are  still  saying  today  that  we  have  an
objective to free our people from  poverty  and  to  free  their  individual
potential to achieve their economic and developmental goals that  they  have
set for themselves.

There's no doubt that despite the economic  achievements  that  our  country
has attained over the past nine years of democracy, the baggage of the  past
regime is still with us. One  of  our  colleagues  here  said  that  we  are
benchmarking our success on somebody else's blunders,  but  we  are  hopeful
that following our good policies, soon the  baggage  of  the  past  will  be
something that we don't have time to talk about.

The level of unemployment that we see everyday  is  still  relatively  high,
and a significant number of our people are still living in  abject  poverty.
Inequalities are still prevalent in our economy, and the  economy  continues
to record a positive but low rate of growth. Evidently, in order for  us  to
reduce these ills, we require policies and strategies that  will  accelerate
economic growth and development, as the Department  of  Trade  and  Industry
has done.

As a province we have already embarked on a process  of  reviewing  some  of
our economic strategies with a view to finding innovative ways of  enhancing
economic growth, small  business  development  and,  more  importantly,  job
opportunities. To this end, we have already commissioned  two  studies,  one
examining the industrial development strategy and the other looking  at  the
private/public partnership projects in the province.

With regard to industrial development, the studies  are  sector-focused.  As
we speak, two sectors have aready been studied, that is the stainless  steel
and petrochemicals clusters. We  are  currently  busy  with  agroprocessing.
What came out of these studies is that there are opportunities  to  exploit,
but as we all know, the only obstacle is that our people lack  the  relevant
skills  to  take  advantage  of  these  opportunities.  Therefore   as   the
provincial government  we  are  currently  looking  at  ways  and  means  of
ensuring that we empower our people accordingly.

The study also confirmed that clustering and  incubation  are  some  of  the
best approaches to apply for industrial development. To date  the  stainless
steel incubator in Middelburg has produced 10 emerging entrepreneurs  within
a period of less than two years, and  10  minicompanies  have  already  been
identified around the incubator,  creating  further  opportunities  for  the
previously disadvantaged. The incubation process is  also  under  way  at  a
furniture cluster in White River and in a jewellery cluster in Barberton.

We have also intensified our investment promotions strategy. Just last  year
we managed new investments to the value  of  approximately  half  a  billion
rand. This figure excludes investment promoted by the private  sector.  What
is also worth noting is that 58% of the investors  that  I'm  talking  about
are local companies.

Our Small, Medium and  Micro  Enterprise  Strategy  is  also  under  review.
However,  such  a  review  is  highly  dependent  on  the  national   review
processes, which are not concluded as yet. However,  we  welcome  the  steps
taken by the DTI, Khula and Ntsika to ensure that they become  more  visible
in the provinces.

The DTI has established three one-stop SMME delivery stations,  including  a
regional office in the province whose  primary  aim  it   is  to  provide  a
comprehensive  network  of  services  under  one  roof  to  the  SMMEs   and
entrepreneurs in general.

Khula has also established three microcredit  outlets  in  the  province  to
assist small  businesspeople,  especially  women  entrepreneurs,  to  access
funding. Again, the biggest challenge facing  the  sector  is  the  lack  of
business skills on  the  part  of  the  emerging  entrepreneurs.  The  local
business  service  centres  that  are  supposed  to  be   discharging   this
responsibility are also under serious financial constraints,  and  are  also
probably facing other challenges as well. Most of them in my  province  are,
unfortunately, nonfunctional.

The role of the Setas is not as visible as we would like it to be. If  these
could be jerked  up,  we  believe  that  a  big  difference  could  be  made
regarding the issue of skills development.

With regard to export promotion, we  have  established  an  export  resource
network centre whose primary role it is to facilitate the  co-ordination  of
small exporters' activities; assist emerging exporters  on  issues  such  as
application for business ventures, claims for EMIA and  empowering  emerging
exporters on export-related  issues.  Believe  me,  the  existence  of  this
institution has seen a lot of smaller  exporters  benefiting  a  great  deal
already. They managed, among other things, to gain access  to  new  markets,
both  locally  and  internationally,  and  also  clinch  good  deals  during
exhibition events which take place domestically and internationally.

The issue of black economic empowerment, which many speakers before me  have
referred to, is very close  to  the  heart  of  the  Mpumalanga  government.
Looking at  our  procurement  transactions  processed  during  the  previous
financial year, the tender board awarded, among others, 313 projects to  the
value of R268,3 million to emerging and established companies.  Of  the  313
projects 214, to the value of R241,2 million, were awarded  to  historically
disadvantaged individuals. And 46 of these projects, to the  tune  of  R62,4
million, were awarded to companies owned by women. Malibongwe! [Praise!].

Although this is a step in the right  direction,  we  believe  that  we  can
still do better. The Preferential Procurement Act requires revision  in  our
view, because  it  still  has  provisions  that  unintentionally  limit  our
people's ability to access work from the Government. For  example,  although
this Act is biased towards the previously disadvantaged, it  does  not  give
room for a geographic spread. Instead you find most of the tenders going  to
the hands of a few. I think something must be done in this respect.

From 29 to 30 May this year the province will be holding  a  black  economic
empowerment conference. The primary objective of this  conference  will  be,
among other things, to customise to the province the new  broad-based  black
economic empowerment framework developed by  the  Department  of  Trade  and
Industry and also to try to find innovative ways of accelerating  enterprise
development within the province ... [Time expired.]

Ms B N SONO: Chairperson of Committees,  hon  Minister,  hon  DG,  to  begin
with, we note that for this financial year the DTI was voted  R2,6  billion,
which is quite a sizeable sum. [Interjections.]

I have my mike on.

Because of the past imbalances of apartheid, I'm going to confine myself  to
the heart of what matters to all of us in Parliament and  the  sitting,  and
that is the creation of  sustainable  jobs,  poverty  alleviation  and  food
security, according to Programmes 3, 5 and 6  respectively  of  this  Budget
Vote.

Two critical policy developments occurred this year, namely the  publication
of the Integrated Manufacturing Strategy and the  introduction  of  the  BEE
Bill  to  Parliament.  Black  empowerment  is  an  important  priority   and
Government is right in taking it seriously and to demand  that  the  private
sector does the same. But high  levels  of  economic  mediation  remain  the
exclusive preserve of men. There is an apparent lack of  the  critical  mass
of women in the BEE initiative, given the unique position that women  occupy
in the business nexus. Formal arrangements  should  be  made  to  bring  the
input of African women into ongoing empowerment efforts.

Essentially, there are two problems  with  Government's  drive  on  the  BEE
front. One, it concerns itself too much with responding to the past,  rather
than planning for the future;  two,  and  most  importantly,  no  particular
attention is paid to growing entrepreneurs, let alone industrialists of  the
future; three, there is no concurrent drive to improve job prospects  across
the board, notably for the poorest, the  least  skilled  and  overwhelmingly
black, who see the very opposite  of  empowerment  in  the  form  of  rising
unemployment.

Capturing of  new  innovations  stops  with  the  Companies  &  Intellectual
Property Registration Office, which is doing  a  sterling  job.  But,  other
than that,  all  the  other  Council  of  Trade  and  Industry  Institutions
agencies do not fulfil their governmental mandates.  The  goings-on  at  the
National Empowerment Fund are a case in point.

It is really a pleasure, Mr Minister, to step into  a  Cipro  office.  Their
service levels are  excellent.  Because  of  Cipro's  position  in  the  DTI
stable, the DA proposes that legislation along the lines of the USA's  Small
Business Regulatory  Empowerment  Fairness  Act  be  considered  and  placed
particularly with Cipro. The Minister should consider this as  part  of  the
ongoing law reform processes that are likely to result in new functions  for
Cipro.

Again as an ongoing process,  monitoring  programmes  should  be  instituted
with a view to encouraging empowerment companies to employ more  workers  as
a due corresponding  obligation.  Secondly,  this  strategy  does  not  lend
enough thought to the type of education to pursue  to  help  us  domesticate
the world of globalisation, considering that  the  world  has  moved  on  to
service industries and financial sophistication. Admittedly, there has  been
shotgun empowerment in the area of microlending, where loans  made  are  for
consumption and not for entrepreneurial purposes.

Trade  agreements  have  improved  market  access  and  facilitated  growth.
Exports to the  USA  under  Agoa  have  risen,  most  notably  in  clothing.
Clothing and textile are among the highly traded products in the world  and,
therefore, this makes it  a  highly  competitive  sector.  The  support  and
protection this sector is enjoying currently makes good economic  sense  and
a policy  measure.  Many  developed  countries  support  their  textile  and
clothing sector and maintain high protection. US duties  on  clothing  range
between 18% and 33%. Mauritius applies 80% duty on imported clothing.

Considering the benefits of Agoa  and  the  propensity  of  this  sector  to
absorb huge labour and the creation of new industries, would it be folly  to
ask the Minister to consider applying stringent  contingency  plans  against
debt-cheap  imports,  especially  from  China,  or  regulating  the  massive
importation into the country of second hand clothing for a  measurable  time
until there has been a creation of more dynamic and productive  agricultural
and textile industrial sectors which complement each other,  and  then  move
on to develop export niches? Hon Rasool did allude to this.

We can look at history and consider how countries such as  Germany  and  the
USA industrialised. Domestic industries were developed under  conditions  of
protection from imports.

I  now  come  to  international  trade  administration.  We  laud  the  Sacu
agreement, but of concern to us is the accelerated  pace  at  which  tariffs
were lowered to levels far below the levels expected by the WTO.  Would  the
hon Minister again  indulge  us  by  giving  due  consideration  to  curbing
further lowering  of  tariffs  or,  alternatively,  holding  them  at  their
present levels for a considerable time?

The thought of laying the US market open to local  business  is  attractive,
but there are concerns that local firms, especially small  businesses,  lack
the skill, production capacity, marketing wherewithal and networks  to  take
full advantage of the opportunities the agreement will present. The  private
sector is still weak, and its capacity to respond is dependent on  the  kind
of human capital available to it.

We require a very selective programme to buttress our  industrial  strategy,
for example,  how  does  the  industrial  strategy  complement  agricultural
production, and vice versa? How to ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Your time has expired, hon member.

Ms B N SONO: ... compliment the Minister for his leadership in  the  various
trade agreements he has ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your time has expired.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Chairperson, hon  Minister,
DG, MECs, hon members, as this will be the  first  time  that  I've  had  an
opportunity to  speak  in  this  Council  since  Mr  Tolo's  appointment  as
Chairperson of the Select Committee on Economic and Foreign  Affairs,  allow
me to congratulate him on his elevation to this important position. We  hope
that we'll have as good a relationship with him as we had with the  previous
chairperson. I hope that he'll continue to keep the department on  its  toes
and ensure that we deliver on the promises that we are making today.

Nine years after attaining  democracy,  South  Africa  finds  itself  firmly
located in the global economy. This is  a  changing  environment  with  many
pressures, and it means that we as a country need to remain competitive  and
dynamic if we are to be successful. This dynamism applies not  only  to  the
business community, but also to the Government and to the institutions  that
support this community. DTI's Budget Vote No 32 that  we  table  before  you
today is  reflective  of  the  changes  that  the  DTI  and  its  family  of
institutions have gone through in order to be dynamic and  effective  enough
to provide leadership to the South African economy so that we  are  able  to
achieve our ultimate goals of job creation,  economic  growth  and  equality
for all South Africans.
The DTI budget highlights our need to be a more responsive institution  that
works with the  business  community  and  provides  it  with  the  necessary
support so that jointly we can tackle the challenges that face us all.  This
has seen the DTI becoming a more service-oriented  institution  and  gearing
its support to the needs of the business  community  and  the  economy.  The
most  effective  means  to  reaching  our  goals  is  through  a  number  of
independently operating entities that  are  well  co-ordinated  and  receive
policy direction from the DTI.

To achieve this, we established a forum in August 2000, called  the  Council
of Trade  and  Industry  Institutions,  COTII  for  short.  Through  regular
quarterly meetings we have been able to develop a common set of  performance
indicators and to ensure that the activities of these institutions meet  the
strategic objectives of the DTI.

COTII comprises 21 institutions that deal with most of the  needs  of  South
African  businesses.  These  range  from   institutions   that   deal   with
development finance,  regulation  and  what  we  refer  to  as  "specialised
services". The latter institutions are those that provide support for  small
businesses, and assist businesses with quality,  standards,  technology  and
innovation. This  area  also  has  institutions  that  deal  with  women  in
business.

The COTI institutions, as a collective, address the many different areas  of
support that is required by an enterprise  in  order  for  it  to  grow  and
become successful. The establishment of the COTII forum has  enabled  us  to
take control of our budget and get accountability  from  these  institutions
regarding the manner  in  which  the  funds  are  spent  and  whether  these
resources are reaching the intended beneficiaries. This forum has also  been
successful in bringing the COTI institutions closer together  so  that  they
achieve greater success in how they assist  the  economic  citizens  of  our
country.

In order to give direction to the  economy  and  provide  COTI  institutions
with a framework  in  which  to  operate,  we  released,  as  the  DTI,  our
Integrated Manufacturing Strategy last year. Some of  the  aspects  of  this
strategy are improved market  access  for  South  African  products  in  key
markets, promotion of beneficiation and value  addition  so  that  value  is
added to the many natural resources that are present  in  our  country,  and
finding ways to harness the skills and expertise that we  have  acquired  so
that we can sell this to other countries.

The IMS identifies the need to capture  local  knowledge  and  to  use  this
information to our advantage. It also encourages big corporations and  large
companies to make greater  use  of  small  businesses  as  well  as  promote
greater integration between the different sectors in  our  economy  so  that
they add value to each other.

In  the  Integrated  Manufacturing  Strategy  we  have  identified  specific
sectors that need to be promoted as they  are  both  competitive  for  South
Africa and have an international potential. These sectors are  clothing  and
textiles, agroprocessing,  metals  and  minerals,  tourism,  automotive  and
transport,  crafts,  chemical  and  biotechnology,  and  knowledge-intensive
services.

Black economic empowerment, small business  development,  increased  use  of
information  and  communication   technology,   job   creation   and,   very
importantly, a more  equitable  geographic  spread  of  investment  will  be
addressed in the implementation of this strategy.

The DTI has recognised that the unequal geographic spread of our economy  is
a negative factor and that long-term structural problems will result  if  it
is not addressed immediately. The DTI  is  addressing  this  issue  in  part
through the work of our COTI institutions. It should, therefore, come as  no
surprise to hon members that a significant portion of  the  DTI  budget,  as
reflected in Vote No 32, is transferred to these institutions.

The COTI institutions have, in one form or another, a presence  in  all  the
provinces of our country, from  the  remote  rural  areas  of  Elim  in  the
Limpopo Province to the Central Business  District  of  Johannesburg.  These
institutions, as we have heard from other hon members, have started to  make
an impact on the economic landscape of South Africa. But they  have  a  huge
task facing them, with thousands of enterprises and  possible  entrepreneurs
approaching them every day for help.

Some of the examples of the impact of the COTI institutions are as  follows.
Firstly, starting with Ntsika Enterprise Promotion Agency, this  agency  has
over the past few years established a network of 170 local business  service
centres  across  the  country  that  offer  business  counselling,   advice,
training and information to Small,  Medium  and  Micro  Enterprises.  Ntsika
also has a successful Tender Advice Centre programme that has been  able  to
facilitate SMMEs winning tenders to the value of R87 million.

Secondly,  the  Manufacturing  Advisory  Centre   (MAC)   programme,   which
initially started as a programme of Ntsika  and  assists  small  and  medium
enterprises in the manufacturing and value-adding sectors  to  become  world
class, has become a successful institution in its own right and has made  an
impact on the economy by providing support to over  1  400  enterprises.  It
has assisted those enterprises to create over 1 800 new  jobs  and  ensuring
that over 15 000 jobs were sustained through their interventions.

Owing to this success, we see the expansion of  the  MAC  programme  to  all
provinces of South Africa, and in  this  Vote  their  budget  allocation  is
being increased from R43 million to R80 million. This increased budget  will
also go towards the extension of the business referral programme, BRAIN  for
short, which they run in 415 locations, as well as increased support in  the
provision of information on franchises and  the  establishment  of  one-stop
shops for business support services.

Thirdly, Khula Enterprise Finance has been successful in the  past  year  in
providing 800 enterprises with R145 million worth of  credit  guarantees  on
their loans and providing wholesale loan finance to  SMME  lending  agencies
for  R77  million.  Through  these   programmes,   Khula   has   contributed
significantly to small and medium enterprises' job creation.

They have also implemented  a  rural  micro  enterprise  lending  programme,
which has lent to over 26 000 micro enterprises. And here  I've  noted  what
Mr Tolo said about the review of Khula, and I'm  hoping  that  the  Minister
will deal with that when he responds to all the members' inputs.

Fourthly, we come to the  Industrial  Development  Corporation,  IDC,  which
provides a number of financial products. It has ensured  that  over  60%  of
its projects were in rural and peri-urban areas. This runs into billions  of
rands that are being put into these less developed areas.

Next is the  CSIR,  which  is  an  agency  that  conducts  multidisciplinary
research and  technological  innovation,  and  has  the  mandate  to  foster
industrial and scientific development. It is represented  in  all  provinces
of the country, with major laboratories in Gauteng,  Western  Cape,  Eastern
Cape and  KwaZulu-Natal.  This  agency  has  been  successful  in  assisting
enterprises with new product development, incubation,  and  improvements  in
existing technology. They offer support in a number  of  sectors,  including
agroprocessing, arts and  crafts,  clothing  and  textiles,  infrastructure,
tourism,  information  and  communication  technology,  motor  industry  and
aeronautical industry.

It is interesting to note that the CSIR has  been  able  to  use  its  high-
technology facilities in order to develop basic  technologies  that  can  be
used by rural communities, for example beadwork, manufacturing of  silk  and
commercialising indigenous food products.

Last but not least, we have the SA Bureau  of  Standards  (SABS),  which  in
addition to setting minimum quality standards for most of  our  manufactured
goods, is also a key institution in the accreditation of firms according  to
international standards, that is the ISO 9 000 or the ISO 14 000.

SABS also played an important role in assisting over  800  small  businesses
across the country to improve their capabilities by  subsidising  the  costs
of  their  ISO  accreditation,  product  testing  and  skills  training   in
standardisation and product certification.

There are also efforts to ensure that all COTI institutions have  programmes
to support women empowerment. In addition to this,  there  are  institutions
that are solely focused on the empowerment of women, namely  the  Technology
for Women  in  Business  (TWIB)  and  the  SA  Women  Entrepreneurs  Network
(SAWEN).

SAWEN was established to assist aspiring and  existing  women  entrepreneurs
in the small business sector to find solutions to the wide range of  gender-
related obstacles that have an adverse  impact  on  their  businesses.  This
network, which is being set  up  across  the  country,  will  address  these
constraints by advocating appropriate policy changes, by  building  capacity
and facilitating the access of women to business resources and information.
There are still a number  of  challenges  that  we  face  in  the  effective
delivery of services by our COTI institutions. The DTI is acutely  aware  of
these challenges and is continually finding ways to improve the  performance
of these institutions so that the business community  and  the  citizens  of
our country are able to benefit from the many services on offer.

To conclude, the vision that we have for the South  African  economy  is  to
ensure that we are a globally competitive country, where  there  is  greater
economic  equality  and  distribution  of  wealth  across  the  geographical
regions of our country.  Through  the  vision  provided  by  the  Integrated
Manufacturing Strategy, the practical support offered by  the  DTI  and  the
COTI institutions to all  businesses  across  the  country,  and  with  your
support for Vote No 32, it will be possible for us to  achieve  this  vision
by 2014.

Allow me, before I sit down, to respond to just  one  issue  raised  by  hon
Sono regarding the BEE strategy and  the  fact  that  it  is  not  clear  on
women's issues. The initiative does provide for women.

In view of the statement by the hon Ramodibe, that if  you  empower  a  man,
you empower an individual, but that if you empower a woman,  you  empower  a
whole nation, we have decided as the Department of  Trade  and  Industry  to
host a BEE seminar for women that is going to integrate the  black  economic
empowerment strategy and come up with proposals that will be implemented.

Hon members know that  the  strategy  is  continually  under  interrogation,
particularly in the area of access to finance. There  are  task  teams  that
have been put in place, so the door is not closed. Whatever suggestions  hon
members have are welcomed. The seminar will be held on 13 and 14 June.

I thank you for listening to me. [Applause.]

Ms S WEINBERG (Gauteng): Thank you Chairperson, I  rise  on  behalf  of  the
province of Gauteng in support of the Vote on Trade and Industry.

Economic growth,  which  is  required  for  development,  is  best  achieved
through the private sector taking advantage of investment and  job  creation
opportunities.  Government's  role,  therefore,  in   stimulating   economic
growth, is to ensure the  creation  of  a  fair  and  efficient  environment
conducive to business activity.

As the 2003-04 budget acknowledges, attention needs to be  paid,  therefore,
to political and economic stability, supported  by  macroeconomic  stability
and policy clarity, rates  of  economic  growth,  labour  market  stability,
investment incentives, the tariff regime  and  the  protection  of  property
rights.  These  factors  need  to  be  underpinned  by  a  clear  regulatory
framework, increased competition, accountability and transparency.

Further, in a globally competitive context,  South  Africa  needs  to  offer
both superior and sustainable returns to investors, while ensuring that  the
benefits of this investment are equitably shared.

In  line  with  national  initiatives,  the  priorities  of  the  provincial
government of Gauteng and its economic policy have identified the  following
core themes: A shift in focus from  macro-  to  microeconomic  issues,  with
greater  stabilisation  and  fiscal  and   macroeconomic   management.   The
challenge now is to ensure  that  the  economy  operates  optimally  at  the
microeconomic level in order for  economic  opportunities  to  be  taken  up
fully and equally across the province and in all local authorities.

More vigorous industrial policy needs to provide a clear  and  strategically
informed framework to ensure that the Gauteng province's  growth  trajectory
is fully transformed and sustained, supporting regional economic growth  and
development. More vigorous investment promotion is required,  and  increased
infrastructure  investment  is  required  to  strengthen  the  viability  of
economic activities and to increase access to these by all citizens.

A boost to SMME promotion and black economic empowerment (BEE)  is  critical
to ensure that the Gauteng province's trade and industry  activity  has  the
potential to benefit, most  widely,  South  Africans  who  are  historically
disadvantaged and disperses these benefits as equitably as possible.

With regard to employment, in 2001 the manufacturing, community  and  social
services sectors employed 38% of those employed in  the  province.  Although
originally a mining region,  mining  accounted  for  only  2,3%.  Growth  in
employment within the mining sector has declined by 3,7% over the past  five
years. The government and agriculture sectors respectively account for  6,5%
and 1,3% of employment.

These figures  emphasise  that  Gauteng  is  a  distinctly  industrial-  and
business-driven region. Employment in Gauteng, as a province, has fallen  on
average by 0,2% per annum over  the  past  five  years.  Sectors  that  have
recorded positive growth in employment during this time were  the  transport
and  communications  sectors;  mostly  attributable  to  the  communications
sector, the finance and retail trade sectors. Negative growth  was  recorded
for all other major industrial sectors.

Employment in the province as a whole is expected to improve over  the  next
five years, with growth in employment averaging around 3% per annum.  Growth
in  employment   will   be   driven   by   the   manufacturing,   transport,
communications and finance services sectors.

Growth in employment by the construction sector is expected  to  improve  as
well. The largest contributor to employment within the manufacturing  sector
is in fabricated metals, which is expected to grow at  an  average  rate  of
3,6% per annum. If you look at the stand outside, you will see  one  of  the
products from one of the small  companies  in  Gauteng,  in  the  fabricated
metals industry - very interesting stuff.

Food and food products will also  increase  by  9,6%.  We  also  have  motor
vehicles and parts and nonelectrical  machinery,  in  contrast  with  value-
added and investment contributions, emphasising capital intensive nature.

Iron and steel is only the sixth largest contributor  to  employment.  Motor
vehicles and parts are  expected  to  grow  to  become  the  second  largest
employer within the manufacturing  sector  by  2007.  This  is  one  of  the
interventions of the Gauteng government in the motor vehicle spares sector.

When it comes to equity, related to the patterns of discrimination that  are
evident in the incidence of unemployment, exclusion  of  black  participants
in the South African economy is apparent in the ownership  of  the  economy.
Although measurements differ, depending on the definition of BEE used,  only
a few percentage points represent black  ownership  of  the  JSE  securities
exchange. Furthermore, the number of black  directors  in  listed  companies
has declined between 1996 and 2002.

Something needs to be turned around. Comparative data on unlisted  companies
is not as readily accessible, but is likely to be similarly affected by  the
inability of previously disadvantaged South Africans to access  the  finance
and all the skills needed  to  advance  optimally  within  organisations  of
their own business operations. This is suggested by the finding  that  black
South Africans defined as African, Indian and coloured,  represent  no  more
than 40% of managers, and only slightly more than  half  of  South  Africa's
skilled workers - 10 years into our democracy, mind you.

Hence, the empowerment of those who have been previously excluded  from  the
ownership and management of the South African economy is a priority  of  the
Government. It is also a requirement for optimal growth of the economy.

Discrimination has meant that South Africa has one of  the  greatest  levels
of income inequality in the world. Empowerment should seek to  address,  not
contribute to this, by spreading its benefits widely, increasing  access  to
basic services, to education, health care and other  services  required  for
effective participation in the economy.

SMME  support  coming  from  this  department  is   particularly   relevant.
Definitions of black economic empowerment have mostly described a  shift  in
both the ownership and control  of  the  economy,  but  have  also  included
initiatives that lead to  the  improvement  in  the  levels  of  most  South
Africans' quality of life.  Hence  a  range  of  initiatives,  such  as  the
National Empowerment Fund, the Employment Equity  Act,  etc.,  work  towards
rebalancing the incidence of budgetary spending,  land  reform  and  support
for SMMEs.

The greatest challenge in addressing inequality lies in rural  areas,  where
70% of South Africans live. Urban poverty is an  increasing  phenomenon  and
represents an important challenge to Gauteng  in  ensuring  that  industrial
and economic activity offers opportunities to all our people. Failing to  do
so in South Africa's  wealthiest  province  will  result  in  deepening  the
already problematic inequality.

The Gauteng provincial government is in the process of developing  a  vision
for 2014 that seeks to build on the work that has  been  done  between  1999
and 2004. The 10-year draft vision  of  the  province  seeks  to  achieve  a
number of outcomes, with citizenship and democracy deepened and realised.

There are high levels of labour-absorbing economic  growth  contributing  to
the development of the province, to the nation and to the  continent.  There
are strong sustainable communities.  There  is  a  productive,  skilled  and
healthy populace, and strong  levels  of  governance  are  in  place.  These
building blocks should guide  the  2014  planning  process  of  the  Gauteng
provincial government.

With those words, I support the Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, we in the ACDP support  this  Vote,  because  we
believe you are an outstanding Minister who has done great  work  for  South
Africa. There are a few things, nevertheless, which I  believe  need  to  be
improved or concentrated  upon.  One  is  the  whole  question  of  consumer
protection, which you also  alluded  to  in  your  speech.  We  really  need
accessible, knowledgeable consumer advice, a  cost  effective  helping  hand
and strong consumer protection.

Minister, a silent debt crisis is ravaging  family  life  in  South  Africa.
Some 3 000 debt judgments per day are being  made  with  people  blacklisted
and taken out of the economy. In January alone, over 100 000 debt  summonses
were issued; 56% more than in 1994. These people, Minister, you  will  know,
physically lose discretion over their  income,  with  garnishee  orders  and
that kind of thing, sometimes for decades. They really become slaves to  the
court orders. The cost is estimated at R1 billion  per  month,  taking  into
account direct costs and costs to the economy.

Employees have piled up debt of R15 billion with microlenders,  R10  billion
with furniture retailers and R18 billion  with  municipalities.  Should  the
Government  not  establish  a  commission  of  inquiry,  or  a  departmental
inquiry, to devise ways and means to stop  this  rot  that  affects  120 000
people per annum?

In my view, consumer education  and  protection  needs  to  be  one  of  the
highest priorities of our Government and society. The private  sector  needs
also to understand that they  have  a  vested  interest  in  protecting  the
consumer  from  exploitation,  and  exploitation  should  be   swiftly   and
effectively dealt with. Business should be warned, and it  should  be  named
and shamed.

In the Western Cape we have not got our Consumer Court up and  running  yet,
in order to provide swift and understandable justice to  aggrieved  parties.
We have, however, got premises, but we are still  waiting  for  the  Central
Evaluation Committee of Finance in the  province  to  fix  the  remuneration
levels so  that  we  can  advertise  for  a  retired  Judge,  magistrate  or
advocate/attorney with 10 years experience; a kind of a Judge Judy  we  need
here in the Western Cape.

Minister Rasool is sitting right here in front of me. He  kindly  said  that
he would expedite the matter and see that it happens swiftly.  So,  we  have
an ally here, Minister.

The 20 offices of the  Consumer  Protector  in  the  Western  Cape  province
continue to do good work, and this year we will  embark  upon  an  ambitious
training programme for the staff of the advice offices. They will  be  doing
a certificate course in consumer law, in conjunction with the  Cape  Academy
and  the  National  Paralegal  Institute,  as  well  as  the  University  of
Potchefstroom.

We also need  to  impart  management  skills  to  the  voluntary  management
committees of these advice offices, and we are seeking to do that.

Lastly, may I say that gambling remains a corrosive and corruptive  practice
that is having ... [Time expired.]

Mr M E SURTY: Chairperson, I will in fact, be speaking in my capacity  as  a
designated delegate from the North West province, and proudly so.

May I just, in my capacity as the Chief Whip  of  the  Council,  mention  or
respond to certain issues raised by the  hon  Minister.  Hon  Minister,  you
spoke about the particular  role  or  the  specific  role  of  the  National
Council of Provinces. In fact, we are mindful of our obligation in terms  of
promoting co-operative  governance.  We  do  believe  that  we  can  play  a
specific role,  given  the  asymmetrical  development  in  our  country  and
amongst our  provinces,  and  we  could  assist  in  the  identification  of
appropriate development sites for purposes of trade and industry.
We also believe that we have an advantage in this country, unlike  Australia
or Germany for that matter, in that we could develop a cohesive approach  in
terms of promotion of trade and industry.  In  the  case  of  Australia  and
Germany you have a situation in which different  states  cannot  even  agree
with one another in terms of regulation and transport arrangements, etc.  We
have that opportunity, and we do believe that this House can  play  a  vital
intergovernmental role in terms of trying to achieve the cohesion  that  you
seek.

The Liquor Act would be a good example. Perhaps there was  a   rationale  in
using your discretion, but you could have introduced the Act  in  either  of
the two Houses. It would have been helpful if you had introduced it  in  the
National Council of Provinces, where you could have  obtained  a  provincial
perspective on the challenges facing provinces in terms  of  that  piece  of
legislation. Having done that, it would then have been debated  quite  fully
in the National Assembly, which would have been informed of the  perspective
of the provinces. Therefore the other way round might have been more  useful
and less dilatory.

In passing, I just want to say that we welcome the  intention  to  introduce
the gambling legislation in this  House,  because  it  certainly  gives  the
provinces an opportunity to be more proactive in this regard.

Having said those few things, we welcome the support  of  the  Ministry  and
the Department in terms of the exhibition that we have  before  us  and  the
constant support to the committees of this House.  The  hon  Minister  ended
his speech with a bit of promotion. May I present  mine  on  behalf  of  the
North West with a statement short, sweet and soothing: "Invest North West".

May I apologise quite formally to both  the  hon  Minister  and  the  Deputy
Minister for the absence of the MEC, who is engaged in  a  strategy  meeting
which had been arranged some months ago and of  which  she  is  a  convenor.
However, she has conveyed her best wishes to both of you.

In relation to the state of economic development  in  the  North  West,  the
province has a population of about 3,3 million, of which  approximately  60%
is rural. During the year  2000,  the  average  per  capita  income  in  the
province was R9 384 and it grew quite significantly in  2001,  to  R15  509,
reflecting positive economic growth in  the  province.  The  provincial  GDP
reached R57,8 billion in 2001 and the real economic  growth  ranged  between
0,4% and 2,9%.

The prospects for 2003 seem very promising and we do  anticipate  growth  of
more than 5% in the North West province. As you all know, perhaps  the  most
important and dominant sector in the North West is the mining sector,  given
the historical value of gold and platinum, which we are  exploiting  to  the
maximum. It contributes between 31% and 33% to the GDP and  23%  employment.
The hon Minister and the Deputy Minister referred to proper  geographic  and
strategic planning around important resources and resource  development  for
purposes of downstreaming microeconomic activities.

We believe that Rustenburg in itself is perhaps the  fastest  growing  city.
It is, in fact, the fastest growing city in the country, and perhaps on  the
continent. One  could  say  that  here  is  an  opportunity  for  developing
initiatives in terms of Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises.

We were a little bit disappointed when we visited the provinces to  evaluate
Khula, Ntsika and various SMMEs,  to  find  that  these  agencies  were  not
available in all the important nodal points. But I do believe that that  has
been addressed and that initiatives that have been taken  by  the  provinces
go a long way towards drawing the attention of national Government in  terms
of support to those particular areas.

There is a syndrome that the hon Minster referred to, the one that seems  to
persist not only in Rustenburg, but  also  in  Nelspruit  and  other  areas,
namely asymmetrical development. You have the same  situation  in  terms  of
acquisition ... There is no land available for development, but you  do  not
find the integration that should occur within those  fast-developing  nodes,
and one really has to address this problem.

One could say that in a way, it would  be  helpful  for  the  Department  of
Trade and Industry to examine the IDPs, with  particular  reference  to  the
LEDs, which are an integral part of the IDPs by statute, and see  what  kind
of plans seem to emerge across the board, among the 284 municipalities,  and
the kind of advice ... Because the level of sophistication in  the  DTI,  in
my opinion - and I think that this is shared by all  MECs  and  members  who
are here - is quite enormous.  The  department  could  guide  provinces  and
assist  them  to  develop  appropriate  initiatives   for   local   economic
development, with particular reference to microeconomic development.

The other aspect is the issue agriculture. This  year  we  have  very,  very
good economic indicators in  our  province.  Agriculture  contributes  quite
significantly to our employment, ie 15%.  About  40%  of  the  sunflower  in
South Africa, for example, is produced  in  the  North  West  province.  The
province also produces an income of approximately  R3 000  per  hectare  for
maize farmers in the  maize  triangle,  the  largest  portion  of  which  is
located in the North West.

We also have land which we will soon have to sell or  lend  to  the  Gauteng
province, which is in our immediate  vicinity.  This  also  brings  to  mind
another important factor, that  of  horizontal  interaction.  I  think  that
there is too little of that occurring in terms of the planning strategy.

This kind of horizontal interaction, particularly with the  various  sectors
of manufacturing, is critical and we would encourage  provinces,  given  the
fact that MECs and special delegates are here, to look at the  matter  quite
urgently. We believe that  whilst  we  are  promoting  provincial  interest,
ultimately we have to ensure that we do so in such a way that  we  establish
a national identity and a national interest in order to  eradicate  poverty.
We should not do so in such a way that we are  overcompetitive  and,  by  so
doing, destroy the fundamentals of sound economic growth.

In terms of manufacturing, obviously there is an attempt in the province  to
promote and foster beneficiation, particularly through  our  mining  sector,
and we think that that is a very important area. we  identified  it  through
the research that has been done. There is a lot of production  going  on  in
terms of food and beverages, as well as metal and non-metal products.  I  am
trying to rush because I am trying to finish the scope of my presentation.

In terms of tourism, I think that the North West has  done  extremely  well.
We have all heard of Sun City and the Lost City. We have also heard  of  the
conservation  parks  which,  again,  are  an  indicator  of  the  need   for
horizontal  interaction.  Not  only  do  our  conservation  parks   straddle
provinces, they now straddle states. We think that here  is  an  opportunity
for provinces to get together and macromanage very  important  entities  for
the creation of job opportunities, etc.

Having  said  so,  we  are  focusing  on  this  particular  area  and   also
establishing downstream economic initiatives through heritage centres,  such
as in Moruleng, Mogwase and Mapok Ndebele village. These have provided  jobs
for more than 1 500 people.

In  terms  of  economic  development  planning  in  the  North   West,   its
industrialisation strategy  has  been  established.  There  is  a  corporate
entity which has a comprehensive strategy in terms of  ensuring  that  there
is both macro- and  microeconomic  development.  It  looks  closely  at  the
bouquet of  agencies  that  the  Minister  and  Deputy  President  -  Deputy
President, my apologies - the Deputy Minister  spoke  about  so  eloquently,
and which I think is very necessary for the provinces.

The primary objective is to brand the province for investment  purposes  and
to do so as in "Invest North West", and also to promote South Africa in  the
process, conscious of the fact that the North  West  is  part  of  a  larger
entity and that it has a particular responsibility.

The North West's strategy - I will call it  Nwedes  -  links  the  IDPs  for
integrated implementation. It means that  there  will  be  interaction  with
local government and provinces in terms of the  alignment  of  IDPs  and  to
ensure that there is consultation among the  various  sectors,  for  example
the agricultural sector, the mining sector, etc,  in  terms  of  initiatives
undertaken.

For this particular purpose, particular  attention  has  been  paid  to  the
spatial development initiatives, and  the  hon  Minister  referred  to  them
specifically in his last address to this House, I recollect.  We  also  have
the platinum corridor, the treasure route, as well as the western  frontier.
These are important routes that give us access not only  to  the  hinterland
of our province, but also to other  states  that  are  prospering,  such  as
Botswana.

We do believe that having developed  these  corridors,  we  are  seeing  the
downstreaming of actual economic activity, and new enterprises are  emerging
along them, which are very  promising  and  which  will  be  monitored  very
closely by Nwedes. Approximately R2 million has  been  set  aside  for  this
particular purpose.

To come to an area that the hon Minister referred to,  and  that  ...  [Time
expired.] [Applause.]

Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, Minister Erwin, Deputy  Minister  Hendricks,
MECs and colleagues, in my speech during the Housing debate  in  this  House
yesterday, I mentioned that the Government's first duty to its people is  to
create  and  provide  the  economic  and  social  circumstances  which   are
conducive to satisfying their basic needs, namely, in  the  first  instance,
food, and, secondly, roofs over their heads.

I also mentioned that those  circumstances  do  not  necessarily  mean  that
Government should provide these needs as such, but  that  it  should  create
and maintain the climate and circumstances which will or should enable able-
bodied men and women  to  provide  for  themselves.  The  country's  economy
should, therefore, be  of  such  a  nature  that  it  will  enable  all  its
inhabitants to maintain a life of dignity. Those comments also  apply,  even
more so, in today's debate.

Those are only the basics. We, however, all aspire to  better  life,  better
and healthier food, better  housing,  clothing  and  lifestyle,  and  better
modes of transport. These goals can only be reached with a  vibrant  economy
that ensures optimum employment. That is where the Department of  Trade  and
Industry plays its role of facilitating economic development and growth  for
South Africa; a role which plans, co-ordinates and  manages  the  activities
necessary for  a  positive  impact  on  the  Government's  stated  goals  of
economic   growth,   employment   creation   and   reduction   of   economic
inequalities.

It would appear that DTI has geared itself over the past  few  years  to  do
just that, as the real GDP seems to be benefiting from positive  input  from
gross   fixed   investments,   household   consumption   and    Government's
expenditure, supported by a strong trade balance  and  a  positive  economic
outlook.

We all know and realise  that  the  fruits  of  economic  prosperity  cannot
remain in the hands of the newly emerged and  previously  privileged  sector
of our population, and that is the reason the development and growth of  the
small business sector is so vitally important. The NNP feels  that  although
much has already been done to develop and empower SMMEs, so much more  still
remains to be done.

Voorsitter, dit is daarom verblydend om te verneem dat  Khula  wat  duidelik
tot nou toe gesukkel het om die mas op te kom, 'n verandering  in  strategie
in gedagte het, naamlik om direk by die verskaffing van leningskapitaal,  in
navolging van  die  vorige  kleinsake-ontwikkelingskorporasie,  betrokke  te
raak. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, therefore it is heartening to note that Khula,  which  clearly
struggled thus far to make it, has a change of strategy in mind,  namely  to
become involved with the provision of loan capital directly,  following  the
example of the former Small Business Development Corporation.]

The indication that the DTI has received a new mandate to  develop  the  co-
operative sector is also welcomed. If properly  developed  and  implemented,
this can be the platform to launch SMMEs, manufacturing and  export  into  a
profitable future. By its very nature, an SMME is small or relatively  small
and its manufacturing output relatively limited.

In contrast, potential clients in the importing market  where  South  Africa
wishes to make  an  impact  normally  place  much  bigger  orders  than  the
manufacturing capacity of individual SMMEs can handle. It might,  therefore,
be appropriate for DTI  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  developing  a
culture  of  co-operative  export  marketing  of  small-  and   medium-sized
manufacturing enterprises, similar and/or complementary products.

Co-operative export marketing was the theme for a doctoral thesis  that  was
submitted in the early 1980s, and although  the  international  trading  and
commercial playing field has changed  significantly  in  the  more  than  20
years since then, the basic principles are still applicable in  the  present
era.

SMMEs still need to cut cost to the bone to survive  in  the  modern,  cruel
competitive world and cannot waste expensive resources on individual  export
operations when it can combine its own technical skills and  entrepreneurial
expertise with those of others who wish to  enter  the  same  export  market
with their similar and complementary products.

Capacity-related export marketing problems can, in other words, be  overcome
to a great extent by combining their limited  spare  production  capacities,
and  financial  and  manpower  resources  into  voluntary  export  marketing
groups.

Voorsitter, ek wil graag van hierdie geleentheid gebruik  maak  om  minister
Erwin geluk te wens met die wyse waarop hy hierdie departement  bestuur.  Hy
kan steeds op my en my party se  steun  staatmaak  om  die  ekonomie  so  te
bestuur dat die beter lewe waarop almal hoop, 'n werklikheid kan  word.  Die
Nuwe NP steun hierdie begrotingspos. [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, I would like to use this opportunity to congratulate  Minister
Erwin on the manner in which  he  manages  this  department.  He  can  still
depend on me and my party's support in managing the economy in  such  a  way
that the better life everyone hopes for can become a  reality.  The  New  NP
supports this Budget Vote. [Applause.]]

Mr S T BELOT (Free State): Chairperson of Committees,  Minister  and  Deputy
Minister, colleagues and hon  members,  let  me  start  off  with  the  most
important thing, that of supporting this Budget Vote, and also thanking  the
DTI family for the support they give to the provinces.

Mr Minister, this is indeed co-operative governance in  action.  It  is  for
this reason that we will always support your Budget Vote and also  not  miss
the Minmecs.

Having said that, our econonomic development programme  in  the  Free  State
province commits to the following: That by 2005 we want to  make  sure  that
economic growth rises to 4,5% and that unemployment falls from 34%  to  31%.
We will, as government, also help  to  create  34 000  new  jobs  that  will
affect 5% of the households in the province.

This we will do by making sure that we strengthen the competitive  advantage
of the Free State and by promoting the creation and expansion of  SMMEs.  We
will  also  enhance  the  livelihood,  security  and  self-reliance  of  our
citizens.

However,  I  need  to  hasten  to  say  that  the  Free  State  economy   is
diversifying. The name of the game in the Free State  is  beneficiation  and
the prerequisite is forward and backward linkages.

The Free State, through its participation in a number  of  exhibitions,  has
given substantial exposure to the Virginia Jewellery School located  at  the
Virginia  Jewellery  Manufacturing  hub.  They  were  also   part   of   the
department's tender at Saitex 2002. Only  two  provinces  were  selected  to
exhibit at the International Investment Forum hosted  by  the  President  of
South Africa,  President  Thabo  Mbeki.  The  Free  State  was  one  of  the
provinces requested to exhibit the activities of the jewellery  school.  The
significance of the jewellery school is that it serves as a tool to  develop
and unleash the creativity, especially of our youth.

I could also say that a Canadian company, South Africa Royal  Manufacturers,
which is  established  in  the  goldfields,  is  currently  championing  the
jewellery manufacturing activities in Virginia. This company has  now  grown
to provide employment to over 1 000 people, mainly  women.  I  am  expecting
women to clap hands. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

As a result of our recent trip to Uganda, we have registered  interest  from
the Ugandan government to send their students to the Free State province  to
be  trained  at  the  jewellery  school.  The  Free   State,   through   its
implementation  arm,  the  Free  State  Development  Corporation,  has  been
instrumental in the refurbishment of factories  in  the  former  Thaba  Nchu
area of Bophuthatswana. Here a meat processing plant, Sky Country, has  been
set up and has attracted 300 additional  jobs.  This  project  represents  a
total  investment  of  R3,8  million.  We  are  also  in  the   process   of
refurbishing the remaining factories as we find new tenants.

As part of the efforts to develop human resources and increase  the  tourism
market share  and  investment  to  the  economy,  we  have  facilitated  the
training  and  accreditation  of   14   tour   guides   from   disadvantaged
backgrounds, as well as 14 young people from  accross  the  province.  Eight
assessors were accredited through the  Tourism  Hospitality,  Education  and
Training Authority. The Free State government has also facilitated  training
for 10 PDIs and B & B owners. We have  identified  tourism  as  one  of  our
economic niches.

We are aware that financing is the big challenge in  the  area  of  economic
activity and economic growth. We have, therefore,  consciously  embarked  on
loan financing to the amount of R122,85 million, which has been approved  by
our implementing  agency,  the  Development  Corporation.  Of  this  amount,
90,46% was allocated to PDI  businesses  with  a  view  to  promoting  black
economic empowerment. As a result, approximately 3 600  jobs  were  created.
As part of the broader objective of pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty,
government will pay special  attention  in  this  financial  year  to  black
economic empowerment.

We have  succeeded  in  opening  the  following  factories  in  the  wealth-
depressed area of Thabo Mafutsanyana, formerly known as Qwaqwa. We have  the
Emaleni Enterprises and Tereen Trading, to mention just two, and  they  have
both created about 1 300 jobs.

With regard to foreign direct investment, we have achieved something to  the
tune of R213 million, which has been attracted to the Harrismith area  which
is also in the Qwaqwa area. This will eventually create 2 000  jobs  over  a
period of three years. We are currently negotiating three  new  investments,
which is a direct result of  investment  in  the  textile  mill.  This  will
ultimately also be located in this area of Qwaqwa. I  want  to  repeat,  for
emphasis,  that  Qwaqwa  is  a  former  homeland  which  needs  our  special
attention.

New investments have also been secured  for  the  Xhariep  District  in  the
southern Free State, which used to be endowed with diamonds, which  are  now
depleted. It has a game meat processing plant as well as a  bottling  plant,
and we believe that the local community will be afforded a 33% share in  the
whole stake.

I am glad to report that the Free State government's  efforts  in  terms  of
trade promotion are reaping positive results. In brief, I  could  share  the
following progress: Free State exports  have  increased  from  approximately
R974 million in 1999 to approximately R1,334 billion in  2000,  representing
an increase of 37%. In  2002  exports  declined  slightly  to  approximately
R1,303 billion. Exports contribute approximately  3%  to  the  Free  State's
GDP.

Our export-promotion programme has targeted Africa as an  important  trading
and investment  partner.  We  have  in  the  past  few  months  successfully
invested in promotion efforts both in Uganda and  in  Kenya.  We  intend  to
sign trade and co-operative agreements with these two countries.

We are certain that the Free State has made a gateway  to  the  eastern  and
central African markets, to showcase our products.  We  will  be  signing  a
memorandum of understanding with the Bei province in Angola  and  accelerate
our investment promotion in West Africa. Mr Minister, Africa, in the  spirit
of Nepad, has become our biggest market these days.

Special emphasis  is  now  placed  on  strengthening  the  capacity  of  our
regions. We have opened regional  offices,  with  a  view  to  bringing  the
services closer to the people. The DTI has participated  well  by  assisting
us in opening these offices, and I want to thank your team, Mr Minister.

Amongst other things, it is important to mention,  as  the  Deputy  Minister
did in her speech, that the Free State Manufacturing  Advice  Centre,  which
is part of Namac, is going to open two other offices in the Free State,  one
in Bloemfontein and the other in Welkom. We have set aside R2,75 million  to
make this possible.

In the Welkom area, the Machabeng  Industrial  Development  Centre  aims  to
assist with business skills and SMME development. We  are  pleased  to  have
established one of the first industrial parks in the province with a  budget
of almost half a million rand. We have put money aside for the  reactivation
of another entrepreneurial centre in Botshabelo.  Botshabelo  was  one  area
that was a dumping groung during the time of apartheid.

A black economic empowerment symposium will be  hosted  by  the  Free  State
government so as to fast-track  the  process  of  absorbing  black  economic
enterprises into the mainstream of the economy, which in  turn  will  assist
us in our overall objective of pushing back the  frontiers  of  poverty.  We
are emphasising the  promotion  of  local  economic  development,  that  is,
building on the strengths and harnessing the weaknesses that  prevail  among
our communities in the Free State.

It is a fact that most new businesses in the community are formed  by  local
entrepreneurs.  Furthermore,  most  new  jobs  result  from  local  business
expansions and start-ups, and not  so  much  from  businesses  moving  to  a
community from elsewhere. These facts  indicate  that  the  development  and
nurturing of locally based businesses should be  a  significant  part  of  a
local development strategy. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T MAKWEYA (Northern Cape): Hon Chair, it gives me great  pleasure,  as  I
stand before you today, to observe that South  Africa  continues  inexorably
towards normalisation and towards the eradication of the apartheid legacy.

Economic transformation  continues  apace  and  we  are  currently  enjoying
unprecedented levels of stability in our macroeconomy. I think  it  is  safe
to say that the last vestiges of  the  apartheid  siege  economy  have  been
superseded by a new South African  economy  that  is  increasingly  globally
competitive and resilient, in the face of  some  of  the  negative  economic
effects being experienced in other parts of  the  world.  I  would  like  to
thank the hon the Minister and his team for a job well done.

Significantly, macroeconomic stability has facilitated the parallel  pursuit
of other transformatory programmes at national level,  such  as  broad-based
black economic empowerment, which continues  to  gather  momentum,  and  the
transformation of the minerals industry through the  implementation  of  the
provisions of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act.

Moreover, and of particular relevance to our provincial colleagues  and  me,
it also provides us with a platform  from  which  to  implement  accelerated
programmes  intended  to  promote  economic  growth   and   development   at
provincial and local government levels.

However, we have to recognise that the spectre of unemployment  and  poverty
looms large. While we can claim to have implemented a  range  of  programmes
and measures targeted at poverty alleviation,  in  the  final  analysis  job
creation is the best means to this end. The  promotion  of  economic  growth
and development, therefore, remains one of the  short-,  medium-  and  long-
term priorities of local, provincial as well as national governments.

We must be mindful of the fact that our  hard-won  democracy  will  only  be
truly entrenched when the majority of South Africans are free from the  yoke
of  poverty,  visited  upon  them   by   the   unemployment   and   economic
marginalisation that is perhaps the enduring apartheid legacy.
In the Northern Cape province we explicitly recognised the  interrelatedness
of the performance of our economy and  the  socioeconomic  conditions  under
which large parts of our population live. We also understand that  our  best
efforts at job  creation,  investment  promotion,  SMME  development,  black
economic empowerment and even social development will come to nought  unless
we and our partners in development can succeed  in  putting  our  provincial
economy back on a positive  growth  path.  Consequently,  the  promotion  of
economic growth and development remains a central challenge of a  government
that aspires to achieve a better life for all.

You may well ask what then are the prospects for growth and  development  in
the Northern Cape, and what  is  being  done  to  realise  those  prospects?
Firstly, while we may aspire to  a  diversified  and  growing  economy  that
makes an increased contribution to the GDP, we need first to  build  on  the
fact that we enjoy a  comparative  and  competitive  economic  advantage  in
natural resource-based industries such as mining and agriculture.

Firstly, all indications are that in the short to medium term there will  be
growth in mining,  agriculture,  tourism  and  in  new  industries  such  as
mariculture  and  game  farming,  which  will  provide  the  basis  for  new
sustainable livelihood in the Northern Cape.

Secondly, from what has been an extensive  and  ongoing  research,  we  have
identified  a  significant   number   of   project-level   economic   growth
opportunities  that  could  provide  the  impetus   for   new   growth   and
development. Some of these projects will  require  that  the  public  sector
take a leading role, and in others that it look to  partnering  the  private
sector as a lead agent  or  developer.  Pure  private  sector  projects,  of
course, remain the domain of the private sector, but we believe that we  can
facilitate some of these by providing appropriate  public  sector  resource-
support measures.

As the Minister has said, each  province  and  each  municipality  needs  to
identify its own economic potential. I believe  that  we  also  need  to  be
clear about what the functional economic  relationships  are  between  these
municipalities, and, for that  matter,  among  provinces,  so  that  we  can
exploit synergies and avoid unnecessary duplication and competition.

In the Northern Cape, we are convinced by our research that  the  provincial
economy can sustain increased levels of economic activity. Admittedly,  much
of that growth potential is in the primary sector, and that  is  because  it
is in this sector  that  we  still  find  our  comparative  and  competitive
advantage. For now, we will, therefore, be focusing on our natural resource-
based industries as  a  source  of  new  economic  growth  and  development,
although we must continue to promote the value-added processing of  our  raw
material output, where this is possible.

The province remains heavily dependent upon  the  mineral  and  agricultural
sectors as a source of livelihood for our people. We  believe  that  in  the
mineral sector, Government's success in achieving consensus with the  mining
industry on the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act as  well  as
the Mining Charter, stands the province in good stead  with  regard  to  the
future of this sector.

We are very excited by the opportunities that  now  present  themselves,  in
particular, the possibility that now exists for  the  mineral  resources  of
the Northern Cape to be employed to the greater advantage of the  people  of
our province.
We are busy exploiting the synergies between mining, mineral  beneficiation,
SMME  development,  black  economic  empowerment   and   regional   economic
development. To do so successfully, we need an even  greater  commitment  to
co-operative governance.

When all is said and done, minerals and energy is not, strictly speaking,  a
provincial  competency.  We,  therefore,  need  to  work  closer  with   the
Department of Minerals and Energy, the Department  of  Trade  and  Industry,
Mintek, the Industrial Development  Corporation  and  other  national  level
agencies  to  ensure  that  many  of  the  opportunities  for   growth   and
development in the mining and minerals industry are realised by  the  people
of the Northern Cape, especially in the Kgalagadi ISRDS Node, where  mineral
development could be central to reducing the incidence of rural poverty.

Just yesterday, the hon Minister of Minerals and Energy was in our  province
and  endorsed  our  efforts  at  establishing  a   provincial   preferential
procurement initiative with the mining companies operating in  the  Northern
Cape. We also had the  opportunity  to  present  to  them  our  value-adding
strategy for this sector.
In agriculture, the other leg on which the Northern Cape provincial  economy
stands, there are also very  good  prospects  for  growth  and  development,
particularly in the  areas  under  irrigation  along  the  Vaal  and  Orange
rivers, where new water rights and the more efficient utilisation  of  water
should  result  in  growth  in  primary  production.  Not  only  do  certain
subsectors continue to grow significantly, but a series  of  public  sector-
led projects are adding impetus to growth in this sector.

Once  again,  though  we  need  to  strengthen  the  process   of   business
development amongst the emerging commercial farmers, who by  and  large  can
be classified as SMMEs, the provincial department of  economic  affairs  and
tourism, together  with  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  and  its
parastatals, must play a more proactive role in this  area,  in  partnership
with the Department of Agriculture, of course.

Once again, the  trick  is  in  finding  the  means  by  which  co-operative
governance between local, provincial and national  level  jurisdictions  can
be brought to bear to more effectively  facilitate  project  development  in
agriculture, where the need for transformation is  so  great,  much  in  the
same way that access to the mining industry has been opened up  through  the
Minerals Charter. There is a need for us to examine how agriculture  can  be
opened up to allow for more rapid development of  black  commercial  farmers
in primary production  diversification,  as  well  as  for  the  accelerated
development of agroprocessing.

Growth in new sectors such as mariculture and tourism is also likely  to  be
an  important  source  of  new  growth  and  development  in  our  province.
Mariculture displays enormous potential for growth along the  Northern  Cape
province's  Namaqualand  coast,   particularly   where   it   involves   the
cultivation  of  high-value  species  for  export.   Favourable   biological
conditions, excellent shore-based infrastructure, the presence of  a  number
of pioneering private  sector  mariculturists  and  a  strong  research  and
development base offer an ideal environment for  investment  and  growth  in
this industry.

For some time  now,  the  provincial  department  of  economic  affairs  and
tourism has been researching the prospects for growth in  this  sector,  and
has now identified a portfolio of projects  for  which  investment  partners
are being actively solicited. Key amongst these is  a  flagship  Namaqualand
Maricultural Industrial Park, which entails the development of  a  clustered
set of complementary maricultural activities sharing  common  infrastructure
and technical and business development support services, borne aside  within
the Richtersveld municipal area.

In our estimation this project,  together  with  the  portfolio  of  related
maricultural projects with a captital  development  cost  of  R150  million,
could create between 500 and 700 jobs over the next three years. To some  of
you that may not sound like very much, but in  the  impoverished  and  small
coastal communities of Namaqualand, this is very  significant,  particularly
in the light of the impending downscaling and closure of the  diamond  mines
over the medium to long term. The Northern Cape provincial government  will,
therefore, be actively promoting this sector in the foreseeable future.

However, yet again, we will forge  more  effective  relationships  with  the
Department  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism's  Marine  and  Coastal
Management, the Department of Science and Technology,  and,  naturally,  the
Department of Trade and Industry, if we  are  to  be  able  to  realise  the
commercial potential of the maricultural opportunities  that  exist  in  our
province. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr T S SETONA: Madam Chairperson of Committees,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy
Minister, hon members, distinguished special delegates from  our  provinces,
I am highly privileged to  be  participating  in  this  policy  debate  this
afternoon on behalf of the ANC, because of its special significance  in  our
historic task to push back the frontiers of poverty.

You will agree that the history  of  the  ANC,  which  I  am  privileged  to
represent today, cannot be written outside  the  context  of  the  ceaseless
effort of the masses of our people to break the shackles of  colonialism  in
all  its  ramifications.  In  my  mind,   this   debate   occupies   special
significance in the tapestry of our history, because it closes a chapter  in
the decade of our freedom since the 27 April 1994 democratic breakthrough.

It is, therefore, fitting that as we enter this debate,  we  do  so  with  a
great sense of celebration of the many successes we  have  attained  in  the
past nine  years  of  democracy  in  destroying  the  barriers  to  economic
participation and ownership on the one hand,  and  in  appreciation  of  the
daunting challenges that lie ahead of us in our ongoing task  to  push  back
the frontiers of poverty, on the other.

Without sounding like a prisoner of the imaginations of  history,  allow  me
to begin by making the  statement  that  the  economic  management  of  this
country prior to 27 April 1994 was not  only  tailored  to  marginalise  and
exploit the oppressed and colonised  majority,  but  more  fundamentally  to
plunder our economy. It is primarily because  of  this  that  today  we  are
faced with huge disparities between the haves  and  have-nots,  and  a  huge
deficit in our balance of payments.

Certainly, the Department of Trade and Industry wouldn't have achieved  what
we will highlight today, as has been highlighted by all speakers  that  have
spoken before me, had it not undergone fundamental  restructuring  that  has
repositioned it to be a  player  in  a  globally  competitive  economy.  The
restructuring process of  the  DTI  was,  amongst  other  things,  aimed  at
eradicating  overlaps  and  duplications  of  agencies   and   institutions;
creating  certainty  and  clarity  in  terms  of   the   mandate   of   each
agency/institution;  enhancing  equitable   geographic   spread   in   their
outreach,  as  well  as  access  to  their  services;  focus   and   greater
accountability.

This process  of  restructuring  culminated  in  the  establishment  of  the
Council of Trade  and  Industry  Institutions,  which  aligned  and  focused
various  agencies  behind  the  Microeconomic  Reform  Strategy,  Integrated
Manufacturing Strategy and the DTI's overall strategic objectives,  as  both
the Minister and the Deputy Minister highlighted earlier on.

With this new organisational regime of the  DTI,  Parliament  is  now  in  a
position to call each and every agency to account for its specific  mandate,
thus enhancing the oversight role and function of Parliament. On  the  basis
of  this,  there  is  moral  and  political  justification  for  all  of  us
supporting  the  increased  allocation  for  institutional  support  to  the
Department of Trade and Industry. And I hope that  all  of  us,  across  the
political spectrum, do so.

We thank the Minister and his department for the hard work done and for  the
visionary  leadership  provided  to  our  country  and  our  Government   in
particular, to turn our economy around from virtual collapse.

In appraising the extent to which the DTI has risen to the task  of  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty, we must do so within the context of its  core
strategic  goals,  namely  accelerating  economic   growth,   creating   new
employment opportunities and, lastly, achieving economic equity.

In view of the goal of accelerating economic growth, no one  can  deny  that
our economy has witnessed an upward growth of 3,5%  in  the  past  financial
year, amidst volatile global financial markets. Over and  above  the  growth
in the economy, we have also witnessed a greater degree of stability in  our
economy, which attests to stability in our policies.  We  have  refused,  as
the ANC-led Government, to  pander  to  populist  choices  in  our  economic
reform and management.

The creation of new employment  opportunities  is  also  key  to  the  DTI's
strategic goals and, of course, derives from the core policy mandate of  the
Reconstruction and Development Programme.  The  key  challenge  facing  this
country, which is also the mother of many  social  ills  that  we  can  talk
about, such as HIV/Aids, alcohol abuse and many others, is the  question  of
joblessness and the deep structural economic inequity.

Before one can even begin to elaborate on these  challenges,  one  ought  to
acknowledge that at the heart of this problem is the distorted  skills  base
of our country, which is not up to scratch  to  confront  the  technological
and entrepreneurial challenges confronting our economy.

The Sector Education and Training Authorities will go  a  long  way  towards
skilling and capacitating our labour force to meet  the  challenges  of  our
time. We can, however, not be complacent now that we have these  SETAs.  The
key challenge is for us as public representatives to,  from  time  to  time,
assess the extent to which we are constantly monitoring the  performance  of
these structures, in particular the SETAs.

One should highlight that in the past five years the Industrial  Development
Corporation has facilitated the creation of more than 70 000 jobs,  approved
projects  responsible  for  generating  more  than  R20  billion  in  export
earnings per annum, facilitated investments worth more than R21  billion  in
South Africa and supported black economic empowerment through the  provision
of loan finance, to the value of R1,4 billion, to enterprises  belonging  to
previously disadvantaged groups.

The Companies and Intellectual Property Registration  Office  has  succeeded
in facilitating the registration of more than 100 000 close corporations  in
a single year, thus improving efficiency in the  delivery  capacity  of  the
DTI. This is contrary to the reading by hon Sono, who said  that  Cipro  has
not lived up to its expectations.

I will not have said anything in this debate, more so  as  I'm  speaking  on
behalf of the ANC, which represents the future of this country and the  hope
of our masses, if I don't talk about the future of this  country,  which  is
in  the  hands  of  the  youth,  in  relation  to  economic   mainstreaming,
participation and empowerment.

The Minister will agree with  me  that  no  one  but  the  ANC  can  provide
solutions to the problems of this country. And as a young person, I want  to
speak on behalf of this sector and say  that  according  to  the  year  2000
report of the Community Agency for Social Enquiry, 62% of  our  economically
active young people in South  Africa  are  unemployed.  Their  prospects  of
securing employment  in  either  the  formal  or  the  informal  sector  are
dwindling each year.

The same report goes further to say that 70% of ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mr Setona, there's a point of order.

Ms B N SONO: Thank you, Chair. I'd like to correct a misnomer ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Is that a  question  or  a  point  of  order?
[Interjections.] No, this is not the time for corrections, member Sono.

Mr Setona, can you continue?

Mr T S SETONA: Chairperson, I was making the  point  that  the  same  report
goes further to say that  70%  of  our  young  people  prefer  to  be  self-
employed, as opposed  to  being  job-seekers.  Now,  Mr  Minister,  the  key
question is: To what extent has the DTI in particular established  bias  and
focus in terms of this particular sector?
I am not raising this question  in  opposition  to  the  question  that  was
raised earlier by the hon Ramodibe from Gauteng, who is  also  my  colleague
in the ANC. I agree with her that when you empower women,  you  empower  the
nation. [Interjections.] But at the same time, we also  need  to  take  that
slogan further and say that when you  empower  the  young  people,  you  are
actually building the future.  Without  the  empowerment  of  young  people,
there's  no  future  for  this  country.  [Interjections.]  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, members of  the  House,  my
colleagues from the provinces, I  think  we've  been  privileged  today,  as
we've been before in the NCOP, to have a picture  of  South  Africa  painted
with regard  to  what's  happening  in  the  different  provinces  at  local
government level. It seems to me that it's an immensely positive picture.

If I think back to  a  few  years  ago,  to  similar  debates,  I  detect  a
completely different feel, spirit and atmosphere; far greater confidence  in
what the provinces can achieve, and I do truly believe that we're  beginning
to see the fruits of a great deal of hard work that has been carried out  by
everybody.
Let me deal very quickly with some of the specific matters  that  have  been
raised and a few general points. I will try to be under 15 minutes,  because
I've noticed, Madam Chair, that when you look  at  people,  it's  dangerous.
[Laughter.]

I would urge us to reflect on Khula. I think there has been  an  expectation
that it can do everything; it can't. I think it has done a lot. But,  it  is
correct, we are reviewing whether we  should  not  allow  Khula  in  certain
areas to do more retail financing, because, remember, it  is  itself  not  a
direct financier; it finances through others, and I think this is not  often
well-understood. We will do it carefully in a manner  that  tries  to  bring
about  some  of  these  collaborative  efforts  within  the  DTI  family  of
institutions.

On procurement, we will  attempt,  through  the  DTI,  to  monitor  the  BEE
components of procurement so  that  we  get  a  more  standardised  approach
throughout the public sector.

With regard to spatial initiatives and SDIs, I think we're pleased with  the
way the provinces have assumed greater responsibility  for  these,  but  are
prepared and will begin looking again at some  of  these  aspects  that  are
important.
With regard to the hon member Bekker and the taxi recap, this is  a  complex
project and we need all the help we can get. I think it's crucial.  Remember
that its original purpose was designed to improve the quality  of  the  taxi
fleet and, therefore, its  safety  for  passengers.  And  I  think  this  is
crucial. That fleet is getting older and there is no way that we  can  avoid
the taxi recap project. So any discussion by anybody that  we  shouldn't  do
it, or anything like that,  is  absolutely  wrong.  That  it  should  remain
largely in the hands of smaller operators, I think is a  good  direction  we
should be taking.

With regard to the World Heritage Sites that you referred  to  in  KZN,  but
also elsewhere in South Africa, I am pleased to say  that  we  have  a  very
good working relationship with the Department of  Environmental  Affair  and
Tourism, both at provincial level and nationally.  We,  of  course,  as  you
know, have joint projects with  them  in  the  sponsorship  of  the  tourism
sector through the manufacturing development programme that the DTI runs.

On the question of export processing zones  as  traditionally  known,  we're
not going to go into those zones. I think that for South Africa it would  be
viewed somewhat askance by many others if we went into  that  area.  So  the
industrial development zones  are  our  version  of  how  we  would  attract
investment into these sophisticated and complex  industries  that  are  more
orientated towards exports.

On the issue of ports, I made comments the other day  that  there  are  many
things that we will address with them. One thing I would urge,  though,  and
as a result of my own department's visit to Durban port,  we  must  be  very
careful  of  comparisons.  You  can't  compare  a  transshipment  port  like
Singapore's  handling  of  containers  with  that  of  an  entry  port  like
Durban's, or an export port. So we need common comparators, and when you  do
that - when you bring in common comparators - it is not that we're that  far
off. I think we mustn't sell ourselves short.

Our harbour systems are not that bad at all. We do have to  improve  certain
efficiency areas, and there are many problems that we're beginning  to  sort
out - I'm pleased to say -  with  the  shipping  lines,  which  already  are
beginning to improve the through-flow of the ports. But it is an  area  that
we're working on as national Government.

I think the point that was made by the hon Sono about Cipro was  a  positive
point. However, we can't move other programmes  into  Cipro.  I  think  it's
done remarkably well. But I think a close look at the DTI agencies,  all  of
them, will see an improvement. We have the ability, for example, to  monitor
the call centre and see who is calling in. Cipro is far and  away  the  most
common destination for incoming calls to  the  call  centre.  Thousands  and
thousands of them are coming in every day. We find a good  response  by  our
agencies to the call centre. So I think we are  seeing  a  general  rise  in
efficiency.

Very quickly, regarding clothing,  let  me  say  that  we  have  antidumping
provisions and we will only use  antidumping  provisions.  We  have  a  very
strict policy on not importing second-hand clothing.  Yet  many  of  you  in
this House keep coming  to  us  and  saying  we  should  import  second-hand
clothing. It's wrong; we can't do that. We will only allow clothing to  come
in under the strictest supervision for  genuine  hardship  cases.  Otherwise
we're going to destroy our industry.

So I would urge you, colleagues, and all over; it makes no sense  for  South
Africa to import second-hand equipment. There are very isolated areas  where
we do  it,  such  as  importing  tyres  for  retreading  only  under  strict
supervision. We're prepared to import machinery and equipment  under  strict
supervision. You can't import second-hand motor cars.  We're  not  going  to
destroy our industry with second-hand motor cars, unless it's your  personal
vehicle or a vintage vehicle.

So I would  urge  you  to  support  me  on  this  issue  of  preventing  the
importation of second-hand products of any type  into  South  Africa,  other
than those very exceptional and limited examples that I've given.

On consumer protection, hon member Durr, I'm pleased you raised it. I  think
this is an important area. In the national DTI we have begun,  I  think,  to
do  excellent  work  in  restructuring  our  division  called  Consumer  and
Corporate Regulatory Division. We will be much more active  in  this  arena,
but I think that all provinces must pay it due attention.

Without a culture of consumer protection, without a system  where  consumers
can come and lodge their complaints, you will get the sort  of  indebtedness
that you have. And you'll get all sorts of other problems that emerge. So  I
would urge all of you, members as well, to put  this  at  the  forefront  of
your minds. Consumer protection is very important for our economy. It  helps
keep the economy quality-conscious and safety-conscious.  It  also  prevents
abuse  of  poor  peoples  and  peoples  in  dire  straits  by   unscrupulous
operators.

I  really  thank  the  hon  member  Surty,  as  the  Chief  Whip,  for   his
contribution. I think, colleagues in this  House,  we're  now  beginning  to
understand, as our democracy matures, just what role the NCOP does  play  in
the economy. And you're absolutely right,  hon  member,  the  NCOP  plays  a
very, very important role in the economy. And we will strengthen  our  links
with you.

It is your job to see  that  within  the  constitutional  construct  of  co-
operative governance, which is a fundamentally important  construct  -  it's
almost unique to us - we still do keep  coherence  in  our  economy.  And  I
think this is a very important role and we will work  with  the  hon  member
Tolo, as the chairperson, to strengthen your hand on this matter. It's  very
important and we will introduce legislation here first.  I  think  that's  a
very good suggestion which we are, as you know, taking up.

On co-operatives and exports,  hon  member  Conroy,  I  think  you're  quite
right. I was very interested to see if you watched one of the  displays  out
there. The marketing companies or trading companies for crafts  are  proving
to be more and more important. And those can easily  be  co-operatives.  But
people don't have the skill in co-operatives, and  those  are  some  of  the
things we'll be looking at at DTI, namely how do you train people to run co-
operatives? It's not easy; it's difficult.

I thank you for the comments on the DTI restructure, hon member  Setona,  as
well as on the  youth.  The  issue  of  youth  employment  is  really  quite
crucial. We started in the information and communication technology  sector;
the ICT Development Council started a  youth  internship  programme.  If  my
memory serves  me  correctly,  we  started  with  50  youngsters.  Some  had
degrees, some were straight out of school and had never  worked  before.  We
put  them  through  a  one-year  course  on  information  and  communication
technology, computer use, networking, and setting up LANs, using  the  Cisco
training courses for things like that. All of them are  now  employed,  half
of them in management. These were all youngsters under twenty-five.

We are now expanding that programme this year. The  DG's  just  informed  me
... Oh, he's run away. The DG informed me  that  we  may  have  to  fund  it
because there was such a demand  for  this  programme  that  we  could  have
trained 900 people this  year.  There  were  60  companies  that  wanted  to
participate. As you've seen from my recent visit in the US,  there  is  this
question of business processing call centres. I think you're  going  to  see
and we'll put a lot of effort into employing young people who are good  with
languages, and we'll train them on computers. And we're  going  flat-out  to
try and support and  develop  youth  employment  programmes.  I  think  it's
crucial.

Some very quick general comments, Madam Chair. You're looking at me and  I'm
getting nervous. I welcome the provincial BEE conferences. Well  done!  This
is important. This policy must be well-understood by everybody  because,  as
we said in that strategy - remember what we  said?  -  this  is  actually  a
strategy for growth and development. It's not a strategy to  move  something
from here to there. So the only way we can make it  a  strategy  for  growth
and development is if the provinces become active  in  it  and  tell  people
about what it is.

With regard to women, let me just assure you that in the DTI I'm a  minority
and I know my place, but we are fundamentally committed to supporting  women
in business because we would be stupid not to. This is the majority  of  our
population.  You  can't  have  an  economy  that's  growing,  where  there's
development taking place, if women are not absolutely fully  participant  in
that economy.

We cannot tolerate any form of discrimination against women if we want  this
economy to provide a better life for all. And I think all of  us  should  be
absolutely crystal clear on that. These efforts to  involve  the  youth  and
women are not just because I'm scared of Lindi; I'm scared of all the  women
sitting up there. They're powerful  at  DTI.  I'm  committed  to  supporting
women in business because I know that  South  Africa  has  to  have  such  a
programme if we're going to have an economy that provides a better life  for
all.

Let me also just urge you,  colleagues  -  we  gave  you  a  small  pack  of
material - to look at it. There's a lot of  interesting  material  in  that.
I'm very proud of the DTI publishing programme. This is a youngster. He's  a
poet in his own right. Under the new Deputy Director-General  of  Marketing,
Manana Moroko,  we  are  beginning  to  publish  interesting  and  important
documentation. I would urge you to read it.

I would urge you, as I said before, to use the information centre.  I  think
it's wrong and would be very bad and remiss of you not to use  that  centre,
because you've got to go and advise your constituencies. How can you  do  it
if you don't have the information? I think it's crucial.

I just want you to look at those displays out there. I get so excited.  This
is fantastic stuff you're seeing out there. These are  all  new  enterprises
that are starting out. Look how sophisticated they are. Thabo, you  spoke  a
little bit about it, but look at that goat meat out  there.  Let's  call  it
"kid meat", or whatever you want to call it, but it's fantastic. This  is  a
whole new industry we're starting.

If you look at the natural silk that I talked about  before,  it's  a  whole
new industry. Go and look at KZN's exhibit, look right at the bottom  -  I'm
not sure why they put it there - but  there's  umuthi  (medicine)  and  nice
things packaged and checked with the University  of  Natal.  Now,  to  think
this economy's not exciting! It's exciting. Things are really happening  out
there.

My thanks to the marketing team under  Manana  Moroko.  And  thanks  to  the
provinces for putting up this display because what we're  starting  to  show
the world is that this is what South Africa can do.

Finally, once again,  comrades,  I  am  privileged  and  honoured  to  be  a
Minister in charge of a department the majority of whose  staff,  no  matter
their race or creed - and we're very representative  -  or  sex,  are  young
people. And these young people are as professional as  anyone  else  in  the
world. That's what gives me excitement, hope  and  pride  about  this  great
country. Thank you, Madam Chair. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister and Deputy Minister, may I  take
this opportunity, on behalf of this House  -  I  think  my  colleagues  will
agree with me - to add to their words by saying: When you empower  a  woman,
you empower the nation; when you empower the youth, you empower the  future;
when you empower this House,  you  empower  nine  provinces,  including  the
local government sphere. Therefore we want to thank you very much.

I was very excited when I saw the stall of Gauteng outside.  I  became  very
inspired and said: If we can produce this in Gauteng, we  can  do  it  as  a
country. Thank you very much, once more. [Applause.]

 THE RIGHT OF CHILDREN TO BE PROTECTED FROM MALTREATMENT, NEGLECT, ABUSE AND
                                 DEGRADATION

[Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, those that are making noise are the people  who
do not care about children, because if they were  concerned  about  children
they would be lending me an ear. [Interjections.] It is very important  that
the communities amongst whom we live know very well  that  the  Constitution
authorises the protection of children against abuse and sexual molestation.

We are talking about children here, flowers that we brought to  this  world,
whom we should nurture and care for.]

The Constitution is  also  very  specific  on  how  we  should  protect  our
children. It states in unambiguous terms, in section 28, that children  have
the right to a name  and  a  nationality  from  birth;  to  family  care  or
parental care, or to appropriate alternative  care  when  removed  from  the
family environment; to basic nutrition, shelter, basic health care  services
and social services; to be protected from maltreatment,  neglect,  abuse  or
degradation; to be protected from exploitative labour practices; not  to  be
required  or  permitted  to  perform  work  or  provide  services  that  are
inappropriate for a person of  that  child's  age;  or  place  at  risk  the
child's wellbeing, education, physical or mental health or spiritual,  moral
or social development.

It is therefore incumbent upon every single one of us in  this  Chamber,  in
our communities and in the world at large, to  expose  the  exploitation  of
children, bring to light those desperately in need  and  protect  those  who
are vulnerable to mental, physical and emotional abuse. We  have  tried,  as
constituency-based representatives of the people, to fill  in  with  details
the  policies  outlined  in  our  Constitution  through   the   passage   of
transformative legislation, keeping in mind the paramount importance of  the
interests of children.

We need only to look at the White  Paper  on  Social  Welfare,  which  takes
cognisance of  the  fact  that  the  wellbeing  of  children  depends  on  a
nurturing and secure  family  environment  that  can  ensure  their  safety,
survival, development and protection. The White Paper encapsulates the  need
for children to have families and a supportive environment in  which  limits
on behaviour can be set, and  the  physical  and  spiritual  environment  is
conducive to children's development so that  they  can  flourish  and  reach
their maximum potential, as is their right.

Children's rights are, therefore, protected in specific  ways  through  many
pieces of South African  legislation  across  various  departments,  and  by
virtue of our ratification of various international instruments such as  the
African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, the  United  Nations
Convention on the  Rights  of  the  Child,  the  Convention  Concerning  the
Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst  Forms  of
Child Labour, etc. The list is endless.  I  hope  that  we  have  all  these
things in our constituency offices.

Through our own continuous analysis of the status of our children,  we  have
recognised that there is widespread poverty among families, and,  therefore,
by  implication,  our  children  are  impoverished  as  well.  An  estimated
11 million children younger than eighteen years were living in poverty  last
year, according to a study by the Children's Institute of the University  of
Cape Town. The university contended that poverty, child abuse and  violence,
and HIV/Aids were the major challenges facing children in South Africa.

We have recognised too that fundamental to  our  children's  development  is
their need for food. The Human Rights Commission, in its  4th  Economic  and
Social Rights Report, outlines this need in the following way:


  Food for human beings is like fuel is to cars. It  is  needed  for  human
  survival. It gives strength to move, the ability to think, warms the body
  and above all, keeps the body system working. Malnutrition on  the  other
  hand, affects people for life by causing underdevelopment of brain cells,
  growth retardation and susceptibility to infectious diseases.

The most encouraging aspect about our Government's response with  regard  to
the protection of the rights of children is that  it  is  never  static.  It
constantly  evolves  and  improves  as  we  are  confronted  with  each  new
challenge that the reality of living throws at us.

In his recent  Budget  Speech,  the  Minister  of  Finance  underscored  the
recognition of this need to improve the conditions in  which  children  live
by announcing that the programme of child support grants will  be  expanded.
Children from seven to eight years old will be included in the grant  system
from April this year; nine- and  ten-year-olds  will  be  accommodated  next
year, and eleven and twelve-year-olds will be accommodated in 2005.

The Department of Social Development, apart from issuing the  child  support
grants to alleviate poverty, is developing a computerised  child  protection
register to fight child abuse and neglect, along with  improvements  in  the
SAPS crime administration  system,  to  enable  four  departments  to  check
children and assist in the monitoring of their cases. We could go on and  on
listing the various  programmes.  We  are  deeply  aware  that  despite  our
legislative framework giving protection to children  in  their  homes,  they
are still vulnerable to external factors, such as gangsterism.

Ngiyetsemba sitawubambisana sibomake nabobabe  ekunakekelweni  kwebantfwana,
singayekeleli kubomake kuphela kube ngabo lebema embili.  Ngiyetsemba  kutsi
nabobabe  kufanele  behambe  embili  ekubambisaneni  nabomake.   Ngiyabonga.
[Tandla.] (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[I hope  that  there  will  be  co-operation  between  mothers  and  fathers
regarding the issue of caring for and protecting  our  children.  We  should
not just leave everything to the mothers in  this  regard.  I  believe  that
fathers should also take their place alongside and work hand  in  hand  with
mothers. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Mrs A M VERSFELD: Thank you, Chairperson. Chairperson, serious  efforts  are
needed  to  redress  the  relative  lack  of  child-specific  data  on   the
betterment of children in the course of development in general. If  we  seek
to improve the wellbeing of children  by  implementing  the  most  effective
policies and services, we need to develop appropriate  measures  to  monitor
the state of children.

The Government ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights  of  the
Child in 1995, and children's rights are entrenched  in  the  South  African
Constitution. This is most welcome.

Although  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  the   Child
stipulates the reporting  structures  and  obligations  of  nations  to  the
United Nations committee, thus far the information contained  in  the  first
follow-up report to the United Nations lacked reliable data. The  monitoring
and evaluation of  the  above-mentioned  should  be  based  on  well-defined
indicators of what civil society and Government perceive to be important.

The DA is very thankful for the increases in child-support, foster care  and
care-dependent grants, and takes note that more  than  1,4 million  children
under the age of six received social grants, and over 2,2  million  children
in September 2002. However, we are very  concerned  about  the  insufficient
subsidies for welfare organisations.
The DA also recognises the most fundamental right of the child,  namely  the
right to life and good  health.  Therefore  we  cannot  understand  why  the
Government is still reluctant to give antiretroviral treatment  to  pregnant
mothers infected with Aids. [Interjections.]

The incidence of child abuse and violence is on the increase  and  the  SAPS
Child Protection Unit is totally,  totally  underfunded,  and  the  lack  of
manpower and resources is having a negative effect  on  the  prosecution  of
perpetrators.

Wat vir my baie ontstellend is en wat daagliks voorkom, is  die  vernedering
van ons skoolgaande kinders wanneer teen hulle gediskrimineer word  oor  wat
hulle ouers gedoen het of versuim het om te doen, soos in die geval  van  as
hulle nie die  skoolgeld betaal nie. Die kinders word dikwels  gestraf  deur
nie rapporte aan hulle uit te reik nie, of hulle word voor  hulle  klasmaats
verneder deur te sê dat hulle ouers geld skuld. Ek glo ook daar sal  ons  as
ouers moet optree teen skole wat dit wel  doen.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[What is  very  upsetting  to  me  and  occurs  on  a  daily  basis  is  the
humiliation of our school-going children when they are  being  discriminated
against because of what their parents have done or neglected to  do,  as  in
the case of their not paying school fees. The children  are  often  punished
by not issuing their reports to them or they  are  humiliated  in  front  of
their classmates by saying that their parents  owe  money.  I  also  believe
that in such cases we, as parents, will have to take  action  against  those
schools that are indeed doing it.]

Finally, the DA appreciates that not only Government is responsible for  the
welfare of our children. All of us should strive to give  our  children  the
best opportunities, because our children are our investment in  the  future.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Voorsitter, kindertyd is 'n kleinood en 'n reg. Jong mense  wat
in armoede leef, word daagliks deur kragte  aangeval  wat  alle  onskuld  en
plesier  van  hulle   wegruk.   Dwelms,   siektes,   geweld,   haweloosheid,
verkragtings en stelsels wat hulle en hulle families keer  op  keer  in  die
steek laat, het permanente en ernstige nagevolge, nie net  vir  arm  kinders
en die mense wat vir hulle omgee  nie,  maar  vir  al  ons  gemeenskappe  en
hierdie land.

Kinders ly die meeste en ook die ernstigste as gevolg  van  elke  euwel  wat
elke individu bedreig. Kindermishandeling bly steeds 'n belangrike  openbare
kwessie. Dit is 'n nasionale en wêreldwye probleem. Dit het  'n  invloed  op
kinders in elke gemeenskap.

Voorsitter, dit is tragies, maar geen kind word vrygeskeld van  mishandeling
nie, soos ons sien in 'n berig in vanoggend  se  Die  Burger:  "Elf  miljoen
kinders in Suid-Afrika leef in armoede."

Voorsitter, een kind wat mishandel word, is een te veel.  Die  NNP  glo  dat
kindermishandeling- en verwaarlosing in alle  segmente  van  ons  samelewing
voorkom, maar die risikofaktore is groter in families en  gemeenskappe  waar
ouers  alkohol  en  dwelms  misbruik,  geïsoleer  is  van  hul  families  en
gemeenskappe, probleme het om hul woede of stres te beheer,  nie  belangstel
in die kernkoestering of veiligheid van hul kinders nie.

Ons het almal 'n rol om te speel  om  sterker  gemeenskappe  te  bou  waarin
families en kinders gewaardeer en ondersteun word. Dit is  in  hierdie  tipe
gemeenskappe  waar  kinders  die   veiligste   is   teen   mishandeling   en
verwaarlosing. Ons moet uitreik na kinders en  ouers  in  ons  gemeenskappe.
Ons moet gemeenskapkoalisies begin om kindermishandeling-  en  verwaarlosing
te voorkom. Rapporteer gevalle waar mishandeling  of  verwaarlosing  vermoed
word.

Ons as lede van die Parlement moet ons kiesers  aanmoedig  om  gevalle  waar
mishandeling of verwaarlosing vermoed word of waar dit voorkom aan te  meld.
Ons moet aanhou om dit aan te meld totdat iets  gedoen  word.  Ons  moet  'n
ondersteuningsnetwerk bou deur betrokke te raak by ons gemeenskappe.

Voorkomende maatreëls moet op familiesterkte gebou  word.  Deur  voorkomende
aktiwiteite in ons gemeenskappe wat gedryf word  deur  gemeenskapsgebaseerde
organisasies,  geloofgebaseerde  organisasies  en  vrywilligers,  sal   baie
families die ondersteuning kry wat hulle nodig het om bymekaar te bly en  in
hulle huise en gemeenskappe vir hulle kinders te sorg.

Voorkomende optrede help ouers om hulle ouervaardighede  te  ontwikkel,  die
voordele van nie-gewelddadige dissiplinetegnieke te verstaan en  hulle  kind
se emosionele,  fisieke  en  ander  ontwikkelingsbehoeftes  te  verstaan  en
daarin te voorsien. Voorkomingsprogramme kan ook ouers en  kinders  help  om
ander behoeftes te identifiseer wat hulle mag hê en  hulp  aan  te  bied  om
daardie addisionele ondersteuning  te  kry.  Potensiële  belanghebbendes  in
voorkomingspogings sluit opvoeders, wetstoepassingsbeamptes, gesondheid-  en
maatskaplike      ontwikkelingswerkers,       alle       staatsdepartemente,
gemeenskapsleiers,  godsdiensleiers,  ouers,  parlementslede,  raadslede  en
besigheidsleiers in. Deur gemeenskapsondersteuning te mobiliseer kan  gehelp
word om te  bou  aan  'n  algemene  bewustheid  en  besorgdheid  om  formele
voorkomingsprogramme te ontwikkel wat daarop gemik is om kinders  veilig  en
families sterk te maak.

Die Nuwe Nasionale Party sien in hierdie pynlike  realiteite  'n  oproep  om
tot aksie oor te gaan namens hierdie land se mees kwesbare,  mees  stemlose,
mees waardevolle inwoners. Dit is waarom die Nuwe Nasionale  Party  glo  dat
aktiewe deelname deur die gemeenskap 'n sleutel is tot die sukses van  enige
voorkoming.
Vrede in die gemeenskap hang af van vrede in die familie. Laat  elkeen  hier
en elkeen wat na die debat  luister  of  kyk  nou  'n  besluit  neem  om  'n
voorbeeld te  stel,  Voorsitter.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, childhood is a gem and a right.  Every  day  young
people who live in poverty are under attack  from  forces  that  snatch  all
innocence  and  pleasure  away  from  them.  Drugs,   illnesses,   violence,
homelessness,  rape  and  systems  which  repeatedly  fail  them  and  their
families, have permanent and serious consequences,  not  only  for  indigent
children and those who care for them, but for all our communities  and  this
country.

Children suffer the most, and more severely, as a result of every ill  which
is a menace to every individual. Child  abuse  still  remains  an  important
public matter. It is a national and world-wide problem. It affects  children
in every community.

Chairperson, it is tragic, but no child is exempted from abuse, as  we  have
seen in an article in Die Burger this  morning:  ``Elf  miljoen  kinders  in
Suid-Afrika leef in armoede.'' Chairperson, one  abused  child  is  one  too
many. The New NP believes that child abuse and neglect happen in  all  walks
of life in our society, but the risk factors are even  greater  in  families
and communities where parents abuse alcohol and  drugs,  are  isolated  from
their families and communities,  have  difficulties  to  control  anger  and
stress, and show no interest in  the  core  nurturing  or  safety  of  their
children.

We all have a role to play in building stronger communities  where  families
and children are valued and supported. It  is  in  this  kind  of  community
where children are the most secure against  abuse  and  neglect.  We  should
reach out to children and parents in our communities.  We  should  establish
coalitions in our communities to prevent child  abuse  and  neglect.  Report
suspected cases of abuse or neglect.

We as members of Parliament should encourage  our  voters  to  report  cases
where abuse or neglect is suspected or where it occurs. We should report  it
continually until such time as something is done. We should build a  support
network by getting involved in our communities.

Preventative measures should  be  based  on  the  strength  of  the  family.
Through  preventative  activities  in  our  communities  -  spearheaded   by
community-based organisations, religious-based organisations and  volunteers
- many families will get the support that they need  to  stay  together  and
provide for their children in their homes and communities.

Preventative  action  helps  parents  to  develop  their  parenting  skills,
understand the advantages of non-violent techniques of  discipline,  and  to
understand and provide for  their  child's  emotional,  physical  and  other
developmental needs. Preventative  programmes  can  also  help  parents  and
children to identify other needs they might have, and  offer  assistance  to
get that  additional  support.  Potential  parties  who  are  interested  in
preventative efforts include educators, law  enforcement  officials,  health
and social development workers, all state  departments,  community  leaders,
religious leaders, parents,  members  of  Parliament,  council  members  and
business leaders. Mobilising the support of the community can help to  build
a  general  awareness  and  concern  for  developing   formal   preventative
programmes which are  aimed  at  keeping  children  safe  and  strengthening
families.
In these painful realities the New NP perceives a call for action on  behalf
of the most  vulnerable,  most  voiceless,  most  valued  citizens  of  this
country. This is why the  New  NP  believes  that  active  participation  by
communities is a key to the success of any prevention.

Peace in the community depends on peace in the home. Let everyone here,  and
everyone listening to or watching the debate, decide to set  an  example  at
once, Chairperson. I thank you. [Applause.]]

Nkk  J  N  VILAKAZI:  Sihlalo   ohloniphekileyo   neNdlu   yonke,   isihloko
esisidingidayo namhlanje  futhi  esibaluleke  ngendlela  eyisimanga  kumuntu
nomuntu emphakathini jikelele nasezweni  lonke  sithi:  ilungelo  lokuvikela
abantwana   bakhuseleke   ekuhlukunyezweni,   ukunganakekelwa    nokwehliswa
isithunzi.  Umntwana  uyimbali  yesizwe.  Umntwana  uyisithombo   esikhuluyo
esidinga ukunakekelwa kahle ukuze sithele  kahle.  Umntwana  uzalwa  emsulwa
engqondweni nasemzimbeni, engazi lutho  oluhle  nolubi.  Baye  bathi  abanye
ingqondo yakhe isuke iyi-tabula  rasa.  Umzali  uyamkhulisa,  amondle  futhi
amnakekele ukuze lapho esemdala alingise umzali wakhe.

Uma  ekhule  kahle  wabukela  konke  ukwenza,  wayalwa,  wafundiswa,  wezwa,
ekugcineni uyaye  athi  umzali,  ``Halala!  Ukuzala  ukuzelula  amathambo''.
Umphakathi uthi wona, ``Uyadela umfazi owazalayo.''  Kodwa,  uma  kungahambi
kahle umzali uyaye  adumale  angaphatheki  kahle.  Angiphathi-ke  khona  uma
ingane iyihlongandlebe kuthiwa, ``Akazalanga lo mama wabola amathumbu.''

Nakhu okufanele  sikuqikelele  njengabazali.  Okokuqala,  ukutshala  uthando
ukuze umntwana abe nothando. Okwesibili,  ukunakekela  ngokudla,  izembatho,
nekhaya elifudumele  yikhona  naye  ezokhula  enze  njalo  emndenini  wakhe.
Ukusizana  okunhlobonhlobo,  uthando  omunye  nomunye,  ukuhlonipha   abanye
abantu nokunye nokunye yikhona okunomphumela omuhle kumntwana okhulayo.

Namhlanje  sikhala  ngobugebengu  obunhlobonhlobo  obuvela  ikakhulu  kulabo
abangakhulanga kahle. Abanye beswela ukunakekelwa, ukufunda, amakhaya  kanti
abanye bahlukumezeka emakhaya baqoma ukuyohlala  ezitaladini  futhi  bagcina
sebebizwa ngama-street children futhi abanye bajoyina ebugebengwini  kanjalo
kanjalo. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson and  the  House  at  large,  the  subject
being discussed today is very important to  individuals  throughout  society
and the whole country. It is about the right of  children  to  be  protected
from abuse, neglect and dehumanisation. Children  are  the  flowers  of  the
nation, they are budding plants  which  need  nurturing  so  that  they  can
flourish properly. At birth babies are pure in mind and body, they  have  no
idea of good or bad. Some people describe that  mind  as  tabula  rasa.  The
parent nurtures and feeds the child so that it  can  be  like  her  when  it
grows up.

If the child has grown up accordingly,  observed  the  right  conduct,  took
good advice, learned the correct things and listened to elders,  the  parent
says: ``Hurrah! It pays to have a child.'' The community says:  ``Happy  are
the women who bear children.'' However, if things do not go the  right  way,
the parent feels disappointed and upset. It is even worse when the child  is
mischievous, and people say: ``This woman did not give birth,  she  had  her
womb contaminated''.

As parents, this is what we must observe. Firstly, we must  plant  the  seed
of love in the children so that they also acquire love.  Secondly,  we  must
provide food, clothing, and a warm home so that the child can  learn  to  do
the same for his family once he becomes an adult. Assisting one  another  in
different ways, loving one another  and  respecting  other  people  are  the
actions which yield good results in a child as he grows up.

Today we complain about different kinds of crimes committed mostly by  those
children who did not have a proper upbringing. Some did not  receive  proper
care, education and homes, while others were abused at home  and  eventually
decided to become street children, some of whom  were  introduced  to  crime
and other bad things.]

If we talk about the rights of children and  their  protection  from  abuse,
maltreatment, neglect and degradation,  the  issue  of  street  children  is
still a sore to the eye because they are exposed daily to  this  cluster  of
problems which needs to be addressed as a priority, especially  here,  where
we are, in the city of Cape Town.

Isihloko sanamuhla siyinselelo kuthina sonke bazali. Asibe  neso  elibukhali
lapho sihlezi khona. UHulumeni akakwazi ukuzibonela  okwenzekayo  ezindaweni
zonke. Yithina  okufanele  simazise  uma  kukhona  okungahambi  kahle  futhi
kudinga isandla somthetho.

Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natali, kula masonto edlulile unina ujikijele  ingane  yakhe
elolini enkulu ihamba yafa khona lapho. Unina  wengane  ubengaphilile  kahle
engqondweni kodwa  ehlala  nengane  encane  ebihlukumezeka  usuku  nosuku  -
bebuka njalo abantu.

Kukhona  izingane  ezingayi  esikoleni  umzali  enawo  amandla  okuzifundisa
umphakathi  usabe  ukuyobika  lokho  eminyangweni  efanele.  Abanye  abazali
banolaka  abalukhiphela  ezinganeni  ngesibhaxu.  Leyo  ngane  izokhula  ibe
ngumhlukumezi osatshwayo endaweni.

Abantwana  bethu  badinga  ukunakekelwa   nokuvikelwa.   Bayizimpiko   zethu
zokundiza,  bayikusasa  lethu,   ngakho   kufanele   sibakhulise   ngendlela
efaneleyo.

IPHINI LIKASIHLALO WAMAKOMIDI: Isikhathi sakho sesiphelile.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Ngiyabonga yize  noma  ngingasaqedanga  kahle.  [Ihlombe.]
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)
[Today's topic is a challenge to all of us as  parents.  We  must  be  alert
where we are. The Government cannot see what happens everywhere. We are  the
ones who should inform it when we see things that are not right,  and  about
those things that require the attention of the legal system.

In Eshowe, KwaZulu-Natal, in the past few weeks a mother threw her  baby  in
front of a moving lorry and it  died  on  the  spot.  This  mother  was  not
mentally sound, but she was staying with  a  small  baby  day  by  day,  and
people were just watching.

There are children whose parents have the capacity to send them  to  school,
yet those children are not attending  school.   Community  members  are  not
bold enough to  go  and  report  such  things  to  the  relevant  government
departments. Some parents have a violent temper and they  take  their  anger
out on the children. Such a child will grow up into a feared abuser in  that
area.

Our children need care and protection. They are the  wings  for  us  to  fly
with. They are our future  and  that  is  why  we  have  to  bring  them  up
properly.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your time has expired.

Mrs J  N  VILAKAZI:  Thank  you,  although  I  could  not  finish  properly.
[Applause.]]

Nksz N C KONDLO: Sihlalo, ndiza  kumgqibezelela  umam'  uVilakazi.  Sihlalo,
malungu abekekileyo  ale  Ndlu,  le  ngxoxo  iqhubeka  ntsuku-ntathu  phambi
kokuba sifike kuSuku lweHlabathi laBantwana,  umhla  wokuqala  kweyeSilimela
kulo sikuwo unyaka. Sikwiveki yeenkqubo ezijongene  nokhuseleko  lwabantwana
(child protection week).

Ngenxa  yeemeko  zokuhlala  ezizalwa  yimeko  yocalucalulo   esisuka   kuyo,
abantwana  beli  lizwe  basenezivubeko,  kwaye  basengamaxhoba   empatho-mbi
yoluntu jikelele eMzantsi Afrika. Uninzi  lwabantwana  beli  lizwe  bahlala,
kwaye  bakhula  phantsi  kwemeko  yentlupheko.  Ikomiti  ebe  iphanda  nzulu
ngenkqubo yokhuseleko (the Comprehensive Social  Security  Committee)  iveze
into  yokuba  izigidi  ezili-11  zabantwana  baseMzantsi  Afrika,  ukususela
kozalwayo  ukuya  koneminyaka  elishumi  elinesibhozo,  baphila   ngaphantsi
kwesixa-mali esingama-200  eerandi.  Omnye  kwabathathu  abantwana  abahlala
ezifama uyasebenza.  Iimeko  abasebenza  phantsi  kwazo  zinobungozi.  Bambi
abahlawulwa nangaloo msebenzi bawenzayo kakade. Bamalunga  namawaka  angama-
840 abantwana abaziinkedama ngenxa  yesifo  uGawulayo,  kwaye  uninzi  lwezi
nkedama  aluxhamli  nakweziphi   na   iinkqubo   zikaRhulumente   ezijongene
nokuhlangabezana nale ngxaki.

Le nto isixelela ukuba uninzi lwezi nkedama  luzifumana  lunoxanduva  lokuba
ngabazali  lona  ngokwalo.  Isithathu  ekhulwini  samakhaya   angasenabazali
ngenxa yeSifo  uGawulayo  nentsholongwane  yaso  siphethwe  ngabantwana.  La
manani  asibonisa  mhlophe  ukuba  sele  ingxamele  ukuba  sisiqhelo   ukuba
amakhaya ajongwe ngabantwana ngenxa yeSifo uGawulayo.

Ngenxa  yokuba  abantwana  kufanele   benze   imisebenzi   yobuntu   obudala
ukujongana neemfuno zekhaya, baphulukana nobuntwana babo, ibenze ke loo  nto
babe ngamaxhoba okuxhatshazwa  ngesondo,  kananjalo  baxhatshazwe  ngamandla
abo. Bambi baba  ngamaxhoba  obundlobongela,  njengoko  sizibonile  iingxelo
zaseNtshona  Koloni,  apho  abantwana  bachatshazelwe  ligazi  bengenatyala.
Bathathu kwisihlanu abantwana  abaxhatshazwa  ngokwesondo  eMzantsi  Afrika.
Bambi basezintolongweni.

Oku   kubonisa   mhlophe    umceli-ngeni    esijongene    nawo    siluluntu,
singuRhulumente, singamalungu amele abantu.
URhulumente  we-ANC  uyenzile  imithetho   ejongene   nokuqinisekisa   ukuba
abantwana baxhamla amalungelo abo njengoko uMgaqo-siseko weli lizwe  usitsho
xa sisiya phaya kwiSahluko sesi-2, kulaa ntloko  yama-28  ethi,  "AmaLungelo
aBantwana".

Ukunyuswa kweminyaka  yabantwana  abafumana  izibonelelo  zenkamnkam  [child
support grant] ukusuka  kwiminyaka  esixhenxe  ukuya  kwelishumi  elinesine,
ngokwezigaba,   yenye   yezinto   ezibonakalisa   iinkqubo    zikaRhulumente
ezijongene namalungelo abantwana. Sithetha nje, zizigidi ezi-2,5  zabantwana
abafumana izibonelelo zenkamnkam. Mhlawumbi eli nani sele  landile  kuba  la
manani akhutshwe nokuphela konyaka-mali, ekupheleni kukaMatshi.  Ngabantwana
abayileyo phaya kuma-570 abaxhamla kwinkqubo  yonakekelo  kuba  bengamaxhoba
eSifo  uGawulayo  neNtsholongwane  yaso.  Lingatshona,   Sihlalo,   liphinde
liphume ilanga, xa  sinokubala  yonke  imigaqo-nkqubo  esekwe  nguRhulumente
ukuzama ukuhlangabezana namalungelo abantwana.

Kambe  ndifuna  ukulungisa  into  encinci,  eye  ithande   ukuvela   kubantu
abathanda  ukwenza  okugwenxa.  Ukunyuka  kwamanani  angeengxelo  zabantwana
abaxhatshazwayo  akubonakalisi  kunyuka  kwezi  zenzo,   koko   kubonakalisa
ukunyuka kweqondo lokuchazwa kwezenzo  zoxhaphazo,  zodlwengulo  nazo  zonke
ezinye  iindlela  zokuthotywa  kwesidima  sabantwana  kwabasemagunyeni.  Ke,
masingabi  nempazamo  yokucinga  ukuba  la  manani  anyuka  ngenxa   yobukho
borhulumente  wedemokhrasi  esiphila  phantsi   kwakhe.    (Translation   of
isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[Ms N C KONDLO: Chair, I am going to finish for Mother Vilakazi. Chair,  hon
members of this House, this debate is taking place three days before we  get
to the World  Children's  Day,  on  1  June  this  year.  We  are  in  Child
Protection Week.

Because of the conditions we live in  that  arise  from  the  discriminatory
conditions that we come  from,  the  children  of  this  country  are  still
traumatised and are still victims of abuse by people  in  general  in  South
Africa. The majority of children in this country live and are growing up  in
conditions  of  hardship.  The  Comprehensive  Social   Security   Committee
revealed that 11 million South African children, from birth up to  18  years
of age, live on less  than  R200.  One  in  every  three  farm  children  is
employed. Their conditions of employment are hazardous. Some  are  not  even
remunerated for the work they do. There are about 840 000 children  orphaned
by Aids and the majority of these orphans don't even enjoy benefits  in  any
one of Government's programmes intended to combat this problem.

This tells us  that  most  of  these  orphans  find  themselves  having  the
responsibility of being parents. Three percent  of  homes  which  no  longer
have parents because of HIV and Aids are child-headed  ones.  These  figures
clearly tell us that  child-headed  homes,  because  of  Aids,  are  rapidly
becoming the norm.

Because of the fact that children have to do work that is normally  done  by
adults, they lose their childhood, which exposes them to  being  victims  of
sexual abuse and abuse in terms of their labour. Others  become  victims  of
violence, as we have seen in reports of the  Western  Cape,  where  innocent
children were affected. Three out of every ten children are sexually  abused
in South Africa. Some are in prison.

This clearly shows us the  challenge  we  are  facing  as  a  community,  as
Government and as representatives of the  people.  The  ANC  Government  has
made laws that ensure  that  children  enjoy  their  rights,  as  stated  in
Chapter 2, section 28, "Children's  Rights"  in  the  Constitution  of  this
country.

Raising the age limit of children who receive the child support  grant  from
age 7 to age 14 in phases is one of the things that illustrate  Government's
programmes that cater  for  children.  As  we  speak  2,5  million  children
receive the child support grant. This  number  may  have  increased  because
these statistics were given in March, at the  end  of  the  financial  year.
Approximately 570 children are in the child care programme because they  are
victims of HIV and Aids. We can count until sunset and again at sunrise  all
the policies put in place by Government in order to cater for the rights  of
children.

However, I want to correct something minor  that  is  inclined  to  manifest
itself in people who like doing things that are wrong. The increase  in  the
child abuse statistics is not an indication of a rise in these acts, but  it
indicates a  rise  in  the  rate  at  which  the  authorities  are  exposing
incidents of abuse, rape and all other manners of lowering  the  dignity  of
children. So let us not be mistaken by thinking that  these  statistics  are
increasing, because there is a democratic  Government  under  which  we  are
living.]
It is only the reporting  that  has  increased,  precisely  because  of  the
opportunities created by the democratic Government led by the ANC.

Xa ndiza kuhlala phantsi, okokuqala ndifuna ukuhlaba  ikhwelo  kweliya  Sebe
lezoPhuhliso loLuntu, lokuba  lizame  ukuqukumbela  laa  Mthetho  uSayilwayo
ujongene  nabantwana  (the  integrated  child  care  Bill),   onjongo   zawo
zikukudibanisa  yonke  imithetho  ethe  saa   kumasebe   ngamasebe   anjongo
ikukulungisa nokujongana neengxaki zabantwana, ukuze sibe  nomthetho  omnye,
ophantsi kwesebe elinye.

Okwesibini,  linga  eliya  Sebe  lezoBulungisa  lingaqinisa  apha  ekuvuleni
iinkundla   zamatyala   ezijongene   ngqo    nokuxoxa    amatyala    anjongo
zikukulungiselela nokubonelela abantwana abaxhatshazwayo.

Kwakhona, ndifuna ukushiya la mazwi athethwe ngabantwana malunga namava  abo
ngendlala. Uthi umntwana ophuma phaya KwaZulu-Natal, kweyona ndawo  ithwaxwa
yindlala, eMsinga, xa ethetha ngamava akhe ngendlala, ndimcaphule:


  It is very hard to go to someone else and ask: ``Please, can you give  me
  some mielie meal?'' The hunger hurts, but you have another pain,  inside,
  of having to ask for food.

Owesibini  umntwana,  xa  ndimcaphula,  uthi  malunga  namava   akhe   okuba
yinkedama  emva  kokushiywa   ngumzali   wakhe   ngenxa   yeSifo   uGawulayo
neNtsholongwane yaso:


  My mother was very sick when she died. I've been worried since my  mother
  died. I do not cry anymore. But I find it difficult to sleep at night.

Ngamava lawo abantwana baseMzantsi Afrika esijongene nabo.  Uxanduva  lwethu
ke  ngoko  singamalungu  ale  Ndlu,  singabantu   abamele   abantu,   kukuba
siqinisekise ukuba  abantwana  bayazixhamla  zonke  iinkqubo  zikaRhulumente
ezijongene namalungelo  abo.  Ndiyabulela.  [Kwaqhwatywa.]  (Translation  of
isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[As I am about to sit down, I firstly want to  call  on  the  Department  of
Social Services to try and  wind  up  the  Bill  that  makes  provision  for
children, ie the Integrated Child Card Bill, which  intends  to  co-ordinate
all the laws that are scattered in various  departments  and  which  aim  to
address and cater for the problems of children  so  that  we  have  one  law
under one department.

Secondly, my wish is that the Department of Justice strengthens its  efforts
to introduce courts of law specifically meant to  hear  cases  that  aim  to
address the plight of abused children and provide for them. I also  want  to
use these words which were uttered by children  about  their  experience  of
hunger. A child from eMsinga  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  an  area  most  struck  by
hunger, said, and I quote:


  It is very hard to go to someone else and ask: "Please, can you  give  me
  some mealie meal?" The hunger hurts, but you have another pain inside, of
  having to ask for food.

A second child said, and I qoute what  she  said  about  her  experience  of
being an orphan after her parents had passed away due to HIV and Aids:


  My mother was very sick when she died. I've been worried since my  mother
  died. I do not cry anymore. But I find it difficult to sleep at night.

Those are the experiences of the  children  of  South  Africa  that  we  are
facing. As members of this House and as representatives of the  people,  our
responsibility therefore, is to ensure that children take advantage  of  all
the  Government  programmes  that  relate  to  their  rights.   Thank   you.
[Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Council adjourned at 18:55.
