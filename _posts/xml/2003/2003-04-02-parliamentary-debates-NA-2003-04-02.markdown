     THE IMMEDIATE AND SUBSTANTIAL USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION
 TECHNOLOGY BY PARLIAMENT FOR TAKING PARLIAMENT TO THE PEOPLE AND CONNECTING
                             THEM TO PARLIAMENT

                          (Subject for discussion)

Mr R J B MOHLALA: Chairperson, the institution called Parliament is a  House
or a Chamber from which the laws of the country are generated.  These  laws,
at the end of the day, affect the whole citizenry. The  laws  are  made  and
passed  by  elected  representatives  of  the  very  same  people  that  are
beneficiaries and  are  affected  by  these  laws.  It  becomes,  therefore,
imperative and  paramount  that  the  beneficiaries  should  become  a  very
active, and not passive, citizenry.

When these laws are debated in Parliament, as  the  whole  institution  that
includes even committees, these debates become debates in the  country  and,
conversely, debates in the country and the whole world over are  debates  in
Parliament.

In keeping with the principles as laid down in the Freedom Charter that  the
people shall govern and that South Africa belongs to all  who  live  in  it,
Parliament has to remain connected with the people so that  they  are  in  a
position to influence the course of events as they unfold,  because  debates
are  aggregates  of  information  at  the   user's   disposal.   Technology,
therefore, becomes an enabler of delivery of services to the benefit of  the
citizens.

The technological advancement of this institution, namely, Parliament,  will
be meaningless if not reciprocated by  the  same  where  beneficiaries  find
themselves.  People  should  be   technology-friendly   and   literate,   as
technology on its own cannot achieve the end  results  of  the  business  of
Parliament. The human factor is still an integral  part  of  technology  and
our lives, and it is a must as it still drives the strategic goals  of  what
we are seeking to achieve.

The various access channels that are accorded by IT in  the  management  and
dissemination of information and communication should create an  interactive
forum between Parliament and  the  people  or  else  Parliament  might  find
itself talking to itself. We do not have to look  at  new  ways  but  rather
just further develop what we already have. The key to all this is to  ensure
that it should not be up to Parliament to determine what  the  people  need.
It should rather be the people themselves who inform Parliament as  to  what
services they need.

The utilisation of IT should be such that  it  accords  citizens  access  to
Parliament  and  government  services  on  demand  and   at   the   people's
convenience. Without information  it  will  be  impossible  to  achieve  the
objectives  of  public  participation,  thereby  widening  the  gap  between
Parliament and the people. In a narrow sense, information and  communication
are weapons that can be used effectively  to  fight  ignorance.  Information
and communication are wealth for this Parliament and  are  characterised  by
the extent to which there  is  the  availability  of  IT  networks  such  as
computers and all associated amenities such as e-mail,  Internet  etc.  But,
as long as our e-mail facilities still reject some messages, this  will  not
serve any purpose.

To illustrate this point, last night when I was preparing for  this  debate,
I actually contacted Sita for them to send me some information  via  e-mail.
Unfortunately they could not, because our server repeatedly rejected the  e-
mail. So, if we are sitting with such an amenity and we cannot use it,  then
it is useless.

Members of Parliament were all issued with laptops and  there  are  still  a
few of us who, even up to today, cannot even  open  that  laptop.  As  such,
they become redundant and useless. Yet, these laptops, if they are  utilised
effectively, will be an asset to our constituencies  who  will  be  able  to
access information. Well, the fact is that at least by now  there  are  more
MPs who are computer literate than there were in 1994. Hopefully,  by  2004,
all members will be able to open up their laptops.

Therefore, technology needs to be  part  and  parcel  of  the  parliamentary
environment so that the users are not technology-shy. We  shouldn't  be  shy
to use technology because it is there to assist us. You know,  as  a  matter
of fact, there are those of us who even today do not know all the  functions
of a cellular phone. I must  state,  therefore,  that  at  the  click  of  a
button, a member of the public can be able to access information as to  what
the activities of Parliament are, irrespective of where such  a  member  is.
And, in such a manner, such a member may even chart his  view  on  any  such
subject of choice through the use of such a facility, thereby being able  to
be in touch with Parliament without  having  to  be  physically  within  the
parliamentary precincts.

These technological facilities also enhance internal  communication  between
committees, between Parliament and Government, and  between  Parliament  and
the departments. The only limitation about  this  information  communication
and dissemination tool is  the  fact  that  there  are  limitations  due  to
resource   constraints   such   as   the   absence   of   electricity    and
telecommunication cables  in  some  rural  areas.  But,  so  far,  the  most
effective telecommunication that actually  transcends  this  limitation  has
been found to be a cellular  phone.  This  device  has  really  taken  South
Africa by storm.

The  public  education  office  of  Parliament  is   one   of   the   useful
establishments to keep members of the public abreast of developments  within
Parliament as they  distribute  pamphlets,  leaflets  and  other  pieces  of
educative information on the basic operation of Parliament.

Of course, the limitation of this tool is  the  fact  that  its  traditional
distribution area is considerably small. Just yesterday,  I  was  discussing
an issue with the hon member Baloyi and he had this to say, and here I  wish
to quote him:


  I was giving  feedback  last  month  to  the  Selwane  community  in  the
  Phalaborwa area when members of the community  found  an  opportunity  to
  raise issues related to the fact  that  stray  animals  from  the  Kruger
  National Park are  causing  problems  for  them  as  they  destroy  their
  subsistence farming produce. I immediately realised a need  to  take  the
  matter up with the relevant government department and, as I am  speaking,
  the matter is receiving  attention.  In  giving  closing  remarks,  a  Mr
  Mogalaka from the same village stated that they felt so good because they
  actually got an opportunity to debate as if they were all  at  Parliament
  Chambers.

Now, this goes to illustrate how our own people are yearning to  participate
in the proceedings of this august House.

The success of legislation that is decided upon  by  Parliament  depends  on
the successful implementation thereof at executive level. There  is  a  need
to take this opportunity to look at the  effectiveness  of  information  and
communication management within government  departments.  To  this  end,  we
would  like  to  look  at  the  activities  of  bodies  such  as  the  State
Information Technology Agency, Sita. Now, Sita has been established to  make
sure that there is clear technological  communication  between  departments,
but the problem that arises is that Sita  is  unable  to  realise  its  full
potential in Parliament, because when Sita has  to  come  forward  with  any
interventions in Parliament,  the  IT  section  of  Parliament  then  has  a
problem in allowing Sita to actually make those interventions. This  is  one
point that we need to look at.

Government  established  what  we  call  Government  Information  Technology
Officers, Gito. Now, this a group of  public  servants  and  officials  who,
from time to time,  meet  and  look  at  the  different  needs  of  all  the
departments. It will be very interesting for Parliament itself  to  actually
form part and parcel of Gito so that we should, at the end of the day,  have
systems that are able to talk to each other and not have systems  that  have
got crossed lines.
Allow me, in this last minute that is left,  to  inform  the  House  on  the
objectives of the parliamentary website. First, it is to provide  a  vehicle
for improving the legislative process in  South  Africa  with  policy-making
strengthened by quality of input from the public. Second, it has to  provide
online  access  which  is  up-to-the-minute   and   archived   parliamentary
information to all of our targeted audience in a well-organised and easy-to-
use manner. Third, it should provide a vehicle for greater,  more  effective
and more accessible public participation in the  legislative  process  using
the Internet as an outreach programme. Fourth, it should educate and  inform
the public about Parliament, the Constitution and the  legislative  process.
Lastly, it should make scheduled  programmes  available  so  that  meetings,
events  and  happenings  that  occur  in  Parliament  or  involving  elected
representatives  are  communicated  to  the  public  and  the   stakeholder.
[Applause.]

Mr V C GORE: Deputy Chairperson, we  live  in  a  new  world  order  of  the
globalised world, with its own defining technologies ... [Interjections.]
Mr M F CASSIM: Order! Can you hear? I think if you could please  assist  and
bring the microphone closer to the speaker. Right, try now hon member.

Mr V C GORE: Deputy Chair, we live in a new world order  of  the  globalised
world with its own defining technologies: computerisation,  miniaturisation,
digitalisation, satellite communication, fibre optics and the Internet.  The
Cold War world order was defined by weight, most notably  the  throw  weight
of your missile. The  defining  measurement  of  the  globalised  system  is
speed; the speed of commerce, travel, communication and innovation.

In the Cold War, the two most frequently asked questions were, ``Whose  side
are you on?'' and ``How big is your  missile?''  In  the  globalised  world,
these have changed to, ``To  what  extent  are  you  connected  to  everyone
else?'' and ``How fast is your modem?''

One of the most undeniable consequences of  globalisation  is  that  it  has
changed forever the relationship between  the  individual  citizen  and  the
state. Because globalisation  has  brought  down  many  of  the  walls  that
limited the individual in terms of movement and communication,  and  because
globalisation has simultaneously wired  the  world  into  LAN  and  WAN  and
networks, it has given more power to the  individual  to  influence  markets
and nation states than at any other time in history.

Individuals can increasingly act on the world stage directly, unmediated  by
the state. Therefore we not only  have  superpowers  and  supermarkets,  but
most importantly we now have superempowered individuals.

Unfortunately, the system of globalisation has come upon us far faster  than
our ability to retrain ourselves to  see  and  comprehend  this  new  beast.
Think of just one fact. Most people had not heard  of  the  Internet  before
1990 and only a handful of people had an e-mail address. That  was  just  12
short years ago. But today the Internet, cellphones and e-mails have  become
essential tools that many people - and not only  in  developed  countries  -
cannot do without. It is within this context of globalisation that  we  find
ourselves as politicians and parliamentarians.

Politics in South Africa, if not the whole world, now has  to  compete  with
the shouting slogans ``Buy me'' or ``use me'' from companies such  as  Coca-
Cola, MTN and Nike.

In the world of the superempowered individual everyone is  competing  for  a
slice of the cake. We are forced to compete against the  likes  of  the  Big
Macs to iMacs to Mickey Mouse.

We need to give credit where credit is due. Madam  Speaker's  initiative  in
delivering Parliament to the average South  African  citizen  has  delivered
results and is most welcomed. She has championed the cause in ensuring  that
the people from Khayelitsha in Cape Town to Krugersdorp in  Gauteng  have  a
glimpse of what their public representatives are doing,  whether  it  be  on
radio or on television.

The question that needs to be asked is whether  we  as  an  institution  are
doing enough in connecting Parliament with all our  South  Africa  citizens?
The simple answer is that we can never do enough. As public  representatives
we must continually strive to nurture relationships with citizens.

 In an ever increasing globalised world, this becomes  even  more  difficult
and we must use every single weapon  at  our  disposal,  including  all  the
modern weapons such as cellphones, PDAs, broadband, UMTS and WCDMA. But  let
us consider  and  ask  the  question,  ``What  are  the  barriers  in  using
technology in communicating with the average citizen?''

The largest chasm  that  divides  us  as  public  representatives  from  our
citizens in the globalised arena is  the  digital  divide.  According  to  a
recent survey by BMI Technology in 2002, less  than  5%  of  South  Africans
have access to the Internet. Another survey  found  that  only  10%  of  all
South Africans have access to telephones. Similar  studies  have  shown  the
percentage of people having access to telephony services in Singapore to  be
58%, 55% in  Hong  Kong,  and  49%  in  Japan.  And  corresponding  Internet
penetration to be 42% in Singapore, 25% in Japan, and 22% in Hong Kong.  The
big question that needs to  be  asked  is,  ``What  is  the  big  difference
between  these  countries  and  South  Africa?''  The  answer  is  simple  -
competition.

Where South Africa struggles under the burden of  one  fixed  line  operator
Telkom  in  the  countries  that  have  achieved  remarkable  telephony  and
Internet penetration rates  the  consumer  or  the  citizen  has  up  to  12
operators to choose from. Choice and competition  are  the  key  ingredients
for affordable and high quality communication services.

Therefore if  we,  as  Parliament,  wish  all  South  Africans  to  use  ICT
technologies in accessing their elected public representatives, the  current
Government's dalliance  with  managed  liberalisation  needs  to  stop.  The
market has to be opened to free and fair competition, and  the  market  must
decide how best to deliver these services to the consumers.

In conclusion, it is simply not good enough to discuss whether we should  or
whether  we  should  not  use  ICT  technologies  to  communicate  with  our
citizens. Put very simply, if we choose not to embrace ICT, we do so at  our
own peril. The peril that we face is that the electorate  become  even  more
apathetic and even more disillusioned about  politicians  and  politics.  As
the voter  slowly  drifts  away,  so  too  will  the  foundations  of  their
democracy that we have fought so strongly to deliver. We have the  power  to
avert this danger. Let us do it together. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Chairperson, I asked for this topic and I am grateful to  the
Chief Whips of the various parties, the IFP and the others, and  I  hope  to
be able today to make the most important speech I have made in this House.

In 1999 Nelson Mandela speaking in the NA as President remarked,


  Because the people of South Africa finally choose a profoundly legal path
  to their revolution, those who frame and enact Constitution and  law  are
  in the vanguard of the fight for change. It is in the  legislatures  that
  the instruments have been fashioned to create a better life for  all.  It
  is here that oversight of Government has been exercised. It is here  that
  our society with all its formulation has had an opportunity to  influence
  policy and its implementation.

We are indeed the new revolutionaries in the  vanguard  of  change.  We  are
confirmed in this role not only by our former president,  but  also  through
the Constitution in sections  59,  72  and  118  which  require  that  South
Africans have a voice in Government and that, very importantly, they act  as
a critical link between citizens and the Government.

The use of information and communication technology makes  it  possible  for
this Parliament to allow the critical link between  the  citizens  of  South
Africa and Parliament to be established. When the hon Speaker  invited  some
of us to join a discussion  with  the  Rockefeller  Brothers  Foundation,  I
could not have guessed the nature of the offer that was being  made  to  our
Parliament. The foundation was offering us the means and the  technology  to
launch nothing less than e-Democracy.

Those who make e-Democracy possible and secure make  tyranny  and  despotism
absolutely impossible. However, if we argue that there are too many  in  our
country that have no access to IT, nor are  likely  in  the  short  term  to
become users of IT, we remove the necessity for them and  for  ourselves  to
change those limitations. We would thereby make those limitations  permanent
and self-inflicting.

Human beings rise to challenges as fast as the challenges are  presented  to
them. The poor too often cannot escape their poverty because of the  poverty
of the vision of their leaders. If  leaders  look  continuously  over  their
shoulders they see the past, not the future, the  starting  point,  not  the
destination. If they see poverty, but not  the  reasons  for  poverty,  they
will offer charity rather than capacity.

e-Democracy can never be meant to block the participation of  citizens,  but
must rather be seen as the blocks in  the  building  of  communities.  Where
communities can effectively exercise their political  voice,  they  will  be
able to speak louder than any voice that is raised here, and  what  is  more
they will be heard.

e-Democracy will allow for active participation  and  where  sensationalism,
terrorism and mannerism are the subjects of headlines in  the  media  today,
in the world of tomorrow activism by the people will be the main outcome  of
the new approach and it is that activism that will  feature  in  news  items
and bulletins.

It is not  enough  in  a  dynamic  and  progressive  democracy  that  a  few
representatives try to do much for everyone. It is vital that  everyone  can
do much for himself or herself. That is the golden key to building a  strong
community and a strong  community  in  turn  builds  a  strong  nation.  The
mobilisation of society is the aim and object  of  modern  politics.  It  is
hard to achieve, as is to be  expected,  but  two  factors  can  assist  the
mobilisation, and these are technology and the rising  levels  of  education
within society.

Never before in human history have so many people  had  the  benefit  of  so
much education and at such high levels. For the first time in human  history
individuals  and  society  can  be  empowered  and  trusted  to  think   for
themselves and further to  do  things  for  themselves,  leave  alone  being
merely trusted, they should actually be entrusted to do so.

Citizens thus easily qualify today to engage in policy making, and the  more
effective representations for those who can speak for themselves  is  surely
competent self-representation. e-Democracy is even more  potent  in  another
way. It  can  keep  authoritarianism  effectively  in  check,  and  in  thus
effectively checking the would-be tyrants and dictators, the door is  opened
wide for transparency and accountability.

e-Democracy does something else. It makes direct  democracy  a  reality  not
just a possibility. In this way it diminishes the  capacity  of  politicians
to  foist  poorly  considered  policies  on  people  and  it   expands   the
opportunities  for  consultation,  participation  and  interaction  by   the
people. By thus promoting authentic public debate,  the  true  interests  of
the wider public are protected.

Over time, MPs  here  and  elsewhere  have  lessened  their  closeness  with
communities and the  proportional  system  of  representation  used  in  our
country has exacerbated the problem. Our lack of closeness to  the  electors
or voters leads to a corresponding lack of closeness by them towards  us  as
public  representatives.  Estrangement  and  cynicism  therefore  grow   and
spread. It is only when the Government can reach  all  the  people  all  the
time that democracy will attain a high summit.

Democracy, as President  Abraham  Lincoln  said,  ``The  government  of  the
people, by the people,  for  the  people  should  be  defined  now  as  `the
government of all the people by all the people for all  the  people.''  From
apartheid politics that excluded the majority, we are now poised to  develop
a government for all that excludes no one. In despotic  countries,  citizens
are  desperate  to  escape  the  ravages  of  cruel  policies;  in  advanced
democracies they help to shape these policies.

e-Democracy also allows for real time gauging of public opinion.  While  the
word `referendum' is a  choice  term  of  politics,  it  has  never  been  a
practice of choice in the day-to-day running of politics. Now it can be.  It
is possible today to reach as many as a million people and have them  e-mail
their responses or votes as happens regularly on our TVs. With  the  support
of the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation it is  possible  to  take  this  idea
even  further  and  to  target  selectively  and  specifically  those  whose
opinions and views are sought.

Once again it is not pie in the  sky,  but  a  new  mode  of  doing  things.
Already in the German Bundestag, leading  parliamentarians  from  the  major
political parties are leading debates  on  significant  current  issues  and
engaging the German public. I do not have a cellphone yet  and  I  will  not
have  a  cellphone,  but  with  SMSs  and  so  on  we  could   actually   be
communicating.

With the use  of  IT  the  discussions  could  be  transmitted  to  all  our
citizens. In the Republic of Peru, a country with which South  Africa  would
be more inclined to compare itself, this  has  gone  even  further  than  we
have. They encourage direct digital communication with their MPs in  respect
of their social needs. In Singapore, there is the e-Citizen  Centre  and  in
Holland  the  government  has  an  essential  databank  on   all   important
information on democracy.

We have been merely toying with the idea of e-Government, but we  will  need
to go much further than that. e-Democracy will allow for something else.  It
will allow for corruption to be busted rather than to be lightly  dusted  at
the surface. Speed of information and the wide spectrum of participation  by
citizens is possible.

The hon President asked that we should engage  in  backroom  offices  and  I
think that indeed, if I have to conclude with what Shakespeare had to say:


  There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the  flood,  leads
  on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows
  and in miseries.

Colleagues, if you wish to have a copy of the speech I will give it  to  you
gladly and I hope that this Parliament will be able to make e-Democracy  and
virtual Parliament a possibility. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I rise on a  point
of order and I would request your immediate ruling. Is it  in  order  for  a
Deputy Chairperson of Committees not to have a cellphone and to  be  totally
unreachable when committee applications need  to  be  consulted  on,  on  an
urgent basis? [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Nel that is not a point of  order.
We proceed with the debate.

Mr M G PHADAGI: Thank you Chairperson and members of Parliament, we are  all
brought  to  Parliament  to  represent  the  people.  As  people   who   are
representatives of structures, it is our duty to take all that is  happening
here to the people, and also to get those people who voted us  to  power  to
be connected to Parliament. This will help us make Parliament accessible  to
the people.

We all know that communication and information dissemination to  our  people
is central to the internal functioning of Parliament. Communication plays  a
major role in deepening our democracy  and  promoting  a  culture  of  human
rights. It is a key pillar in the transformation of our country.  Parliament
should communicate in a way that is simple and clear, and use  the  language
that could be understood better by the people.

Parliament at this point must really make a concerted effort to improve  its
image. We need an all-out campaign to bolster the image of Parliament,  that
it is not seen as far removed from the people,  but  instead  accessible  to
the masses. People must know that  Parliament  is  not  just  about  passing
laws, but that it also has an oversight role,  and  that  bread  and  butter
issues affecting our people are discussed in Parliament on a daily basis.

paragraphs follows.)

[Many people cannot access Parliament because they live far  away  in  rural
areas. During its past  conference,  the  ANC  looked  at  this  matter  and
realised that it is better to formulate a way in which people will  be  able
to access Parliament. It was realised that it would be better if  Parliament
had its own TV channel which would broadcast all the time when  in  session.
That will help people to know what is actually happening in Parliament.

The conference also  took  the  issue  of  radio  news  into  consideration,
besides the television which broadcasts for a short space of time. There  is
as yet no radio station which broadcasts the proceedings in  Parliament.  It
was agreed that there must be a radio station which will take everything  to
the people. Many of our people don't have money to buy apparatus  that  will
enable them to see and hear what is happening in  Parliament.  Again,  there
must  be  a  Parliamentary  newspaper  which  will  be  distributed  to  our
provincial offices.]

Furthermore, we realise the most effective method of communicating with  our
people besides radio is newspaper. So the suggestion  is  that  we  feel  we
should have a newspaper dedicated to Parliament, and it must be  distributed
in our constituency offices.

The multipurpose community  centres  can  be  used  as  a  vehicle  for  the
implementation of development, communication and information  programmes  as
they can serve as a base from which a wide range of  services  and  products
can reach the community. These centres can be used as the  response  to  the
particular historical and social economic factors  which  are  characterised
by freedom of access to information and citizen participation  in  our  past
political system. These include the  socioeconomic  problems  such  as  high
levels of poverty, unemployment, low standards of  living,  poor  access  to
basic services, remote settlement patterns, lack of  access  to  information
and technology, poor health services, lack of education and skills, lack  of
infrastructure and many other services.

The benefit  to  this  community  will  include  the  following:  Parliament
information and service will be right at the doorstep of communities.  These
centres are also where the community events will take place  such  as  music
concerts, meetings, voting and  workshops.  The  centres  are  placed  where
Government representatives  and  elected  members  of  Parliament  can  hold
forums to discuss with the communities.

GCIS has used MPCC and post offices to broadcast the President's speech  and
the Budget speech. Parliament must  learn  from  this  and  use  video  most
widely to take out our people's key pieces of legislation.  These  are  also
available  on  the  parliamentary  website,  which  is  fairly  interactive.
Parliament's website is certainly a step in the right  direction.  Meanwhile
for those who are  computer  literate  and  are  not  truly  overwhelmed  by
technology, the Public Internet Terminal - PIT - can also be used to  access
Government information and Parliament.

This service was launched in 1998 as a joint project between the  Department
of Communications and the Post Office. It has now successfully  completed  a
pilot project, providing the accessibility  of  PITs  concept.  PIT  entails
multimedia kiosk-style terminals, being located in post  offices  and  other
sites around the country.

The use of PIT facilities is by smart card technology, accessing a range  of
electronic communication links. The terminals  can  be  used  by  people  to
access discussions, documents or legislation. People should be  able  to  e-
mail members of Parliament and  make  submissions  or  submit  questions  to
Parliament.

It is also good and well  that  we  have  a  comprehensive  and  interactive
parliamentary website, and that we have  Public  Information  Terminals  for
people to access Parliament. This achievement must be celebrated as  we  now
enter an era of globalisation  and  the  global  village.  We  cannot  allow
ourselves to be left behind by technology. However, the reality is that  the
majority of people feel very overwhelmed by technology. We  know  this  from
our own experience.

are pleased to get the information from the newspapers, radio and TV  rather
than getting it from computers.  Therefore,  we  are  suggesting  that  this
Parliament must have its own newspaper and a radio station. I thank you.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Mooi praat, Martha, mooi praat.

Mev M E OLCKERS: Ek sal, Blommetjie, ek sal. Voorsitter, as ons  vandag  wil
praat oor hoe om die boodskap van die Parlement by die kiesers te  kry,  dan
moet ons  eerstens  selfondersoek  doen.  Daar  is  'n  verskil  tussen  die
boodskap uitdra en die beeld bou en  waardig  wees.  Kom  ons  gaan  bietjie
``back to basics''.

Ons as lede van die Parlement  is  deur  die  kiesers  hierheen  gestuur  om
namens hulle te praat. Maar as die  Parlement  se  sittings  deur  'n  klein
handjievol lede bygewoon word en die komitees het nie kworums nie, doen  ons
nie ons plig nie. Daar is te veel mediaberigte en daar word te  dikwels  leë
sitplekke  op  die  televisieskerms  gesien,  om  die  waardigheid  van  die
Parlement te handhaaf. As ons dus praat van die Parlement na die  mense  toe
neem, moet ons as lede eers die sittings bywoon, sodat ons weet wat  om  aan
die kiesers oor te dra. Lede moet in die Parlement wees om sinvolle  bydraes
te maak. Jy maak dit nie vanuit jou kantoor of jou  huis  of  die  gholfbaan
nie.

Die bywoning van die Parlement strek ons as politici nie tot eer nie,  veral
nie as jy slegs vier keer per jaar in die Parlement is nie en jou party  nie
teen jou optree nie. Hoe kan 'n sterk  party  toelaat  dat  een  enkele  lid
hulle so gyselaar hou? Wat wil ons dan aan die kiesers bemark? Die feit  dat
daar nie meer 'n vasgestelde kworum vir die werksaamhede van  die  Parlement
se bywoning is nie, vererger hierdie feit ook. As daar van ons  lede  verwag
word om te verstaan wat in die  verskillende  tale  in  die  Parlement  gesê
word, moet ons 'n vertaaldiens kry wat bekwaam en effektief is.  Hiermee  sê
ek nie die persone wat die werk doen is nie goed genoeg  nie.  Hulle  is  in
diens van die Parlement en vir hierdie diens om professioneel te  wees,  sal
die werk aan 'n professionele firma gekontrakteer  word,  bekwame  vertalers
is skaars en duur en daarom sal 'n firma wat hierin spesialiseer,  'n  beter
diens kan lewer.

Dit  is  ook  onaanvaarbaar  dat  daar   geen   vertalingsdienste   in   die
komiteekamers is nie of vertalingsdienste op die openbare galerye  nie.  Dit
moedig nie die publiek aan om die sittings by te woon nie. Dit  lei  daartoe
dat Engels meestal gebruik word en deur dit te doen, gee ons nie uiting  aan
die  vereistes  van  die  Grondwet  nie.  Die  Parlement  se   komitee   vir
ledebelange sal eerstens sy eie huis in  orde  moet  kry,  voordat  duisende
rande spandeer word aan hoë  tegnologie  om  buite  die  Parlementsgebou  te
gebruik. Die beste manier bly steeds om persoonlik die boodskap oor te  dra,
maar dit is nie moontlik as jy 50 000 of meer kiesers het om te bedien  nie.
Daarom is die  radio,  die  televisie  en  die  gedrukte  media  steeds  die
waardevolste wyses waarop die kiesers ingelig kan word, oor wat  in  hierdie
Huis gebeur. Ons moenie vergeet ons woon in Afrika  nie.  Die  publiek  moet
nie die idee kry dat slegs die Kabinet hard werk nie. Ja, hulle  werk  hard,
maar  hulle  het  'n  onderbou  en  'n   infrastruktuur   wat   baie   help.
Parlementslede werk hard, maar die persepsie daar  buite  is  dat  ons  baie
geld kry vir min werk. Dis omdat ons nie hier is nie. Hulle sien ons nie.

Dikwels gebeur dit dat lede vir 'n tydperk in hul kantore moet werk  en  dan
is daar nie 'n televisie om die debat in die Parlement of  in  die  komitees
te volg nie, want die lede het nie televisiestelle in hul kantore  nie.  Wat
sê die ledebelangekomitee daarvan? Daar sal indringend gekyk  moet  word  na
die onderbou van die  gewone  lid  van  die  Parlement.  Hoë  tegnologie  is
waardevol en asemrowend, maar die mens wat daarvan gebruik  wil  maak,  moet
weet watter knoppie om wanneer te druk. Meer nog, die mens  moet  daar  wees
om die knoppie te druk; nie so leeg soos dit vandag hier is nie.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr D V BLOEM: Speak nicely, Martha, speak nicely.

Mrs M E OLCKERS: I will, Blommetjie, I will.  Chairperson,  if  we  want  to
speak today on how to get the message of Parliament to the electorate,  then
we would first have to do some introspection. There is a difference  between
carrying out the message and developing the image and being  dignified.  Let
us get back to basics.

We as members of Parliament were sent here by the voters to speak  on  their
behalf. But if the sittings of Parliament  are  only  attended  by  a  small
handful of members and the committees have  no  quorums,  then  we  are  not
doing our duty. There are too many media  reports,  and  too  often  we  see
empty seats on television, to maintain the dignity of Parliament. If we  are
therefore talking about taking Parliament  to  the  people,  we  as  members
should first attend sittings, so that we know what to convey to the  voters.
Members should be in Parliament to make meaningful contributions.  One  does
not make them from one's office or from home or from the golf course.
The attendance of Parliament does not honour us as  politicians,  especially
if one only attends Parliament four times a year and one's  party  does  not
reprimand one. How can a strong party allow itself to be held hostage  by  a
single member? What do we want to market to the electorate?  The  fact  that
there  is  no  longer  a  fixed  quorum  for  attending  the  activities  of
Parliament  makes  this  even  worse.  If  it  is  expected  of  members  to
understand what is said in the different languages in  Parliament,  we  need
an efficient and effective translation service. By this I  am  not  implying
that  the  people  doing  the  work  are  not  good  enough.  They  are   in
Parliament's employ and for this service to be professional,  the  work  has
to be contracted out to a professional firm. Expert translators are few  and
expensive and therefore a firm specialising in this would deliver  a  better
service.

It is also unacceptable that  there  are  no  translation  services  in  the
committee rooms or translation facilities  on  the  public  galleries.  This
does not encourage members of the public to attend  sittings.  As  a  result
English is used most often, and by doing so we are not acting  according  to
the requirements set out in the Constitution.  The  parliamentary  committee
dealing with members' interests should first get  its  own  house  in  order
before thousands of rands are  spent  on  advanced  technology  to  be  used
outside Parliament. The best way is still to convey the message  personally,
but that is not possible if  one  has  to  serve  50  000  voters  or  more.
Therefore radio, television  and  the  printed  media  are  still  the  most
valuable ways in which to inform the voters of what  is  happening  in  this
House. We should not forget that we are living in  Africa.  Members  of  the
public should not get the impression that it is only  the  Cabinet  that  is
working hard. Yes, they do work hard, but they have an  infrastructure  that
helps a great deal. Members of Parliament work hard, but the perception  out
there is that we get a lot of money for little work. It is  because  we  are
not here. They do not see us.

Often it happens that members have to work in their offices for a period  of
time, and then there is no television on  which  to  follow  the  debate  in
Parliament or in the committees, because  the  members  have  no  television
sets in their offices. What does the committee on  members'  interests  have
to say about that? We will have to look incisively at the infrastructure  of
the ordinary members of Parliament.  Advanced  technology  is  valuable  and
breathtaking, but the person who wants to make use of it has to  know  which
button to press when. Even more so, the person has to be there to press  the
button; it should not be as empty as it is here today. [Applause.]]

Mr G T  MADIKIZA:  Deputy  Chair  and  hon  members,  the  accessibility  of
Parliament to the people is a duty  of  this  institution  that  is  clearly
invoked in the Constitution of South Africa.

The use of information and communication technology could and should play  a
role in our endeavours to ensure that this is  truly  a  Parliament  of  the
people for the people. This does not mean that parliamentary access for  the
public should be reserved only for those fortunate enough to have access  to
the Internet and related technologies.  The  primary  mode  of  access,  for
millions of South Africans, to  information  about  Parliament  remains  the
media - whether it is radio, television or print media. This  is  technology
that is already at Parliament's disposal.

Before we start  talking  about  fancy  new  technologies,  we  should  look
towards  the  parliamentary  media  corps.  The  question  then  arises:  Is
Parliament following the correct and relevant course  in  its  treatment  of
the parliamentary media? I submit that the answer is no.

The very people and organisations that dedicate their time and resources  to
inform the public of our activities here are being treated  like  squatters,
despite their unquestioned commitment to the new  democratic  South  Africa.
If Parliament continues down this  road  of  alienating  the  media,  it  is
facing the very real danger of destroying the  link  connecting  it  to  the
people who elected it. I thank you.

Mr  L  M  GREEN:  Chairperson,  an  important  role  of  Parliament  is   to
communicate  with  its  beneficiaries,  the  citizens.  The  strength  of  a
democratic society is the amount of information that ordinary  citizens  can
have access to.  In  a  postmodern  society  the  role  of  information  and
communication technology, or ICT, as we know it, has  increased  to  such  a
level that information has become a highly competitive market.

Governments around the world are pressurised  to  compete  with  information
from various sectors and organisations. The Internet is the most  innovative
way that information is distributed across the world.  A  problem,  however,
is the size of the information  highway,  with  the  initial  cost  in  both
hardware and software in order to  be  linked  to  the  information  highway
being inhibiting factors.

It is this superinformation  highway  that  creates  difficulties  for  both
Government and Parliament to effectively reach the people. The Internet  has
a variety of information products and Government information is but  one  of
the many products. If Parliament wants to attract citizens' attention  their
product offer should be attractive, interesting  and  up  to  date.  Service
delivery should be an important target  objective  of  both  Government  and
Parliament.

Therefore, ICT should be the  next  wave  that  requires  major  investment.
Institutional capacity must be enhanced to draw people to centres,  such  as
multipurpose  centres,  where  ICT  facilities  should  be  made  available.
Schools  and  community  libraries  provide  the  best  infrastructure   for
accessing information and enhancing  the  educational  capacity.  Therefore,
there should be links between Parliament's  information  system  and  public
libraries, and possibly schools.

Finally, I wish to take this opportunity to commend the  DTI  for  providing
an excellent information centre on the sixth floor of 120 Plein  Street.  As
MPs we must use this facility to bring  Parliament  closer  to  the  people.
Thank you.

Mr  R  P  Z  VAN  DEN  HEEVER:  Chairperson,  at   the   47th   Commonwealth
Parliamentary Conference in Australia, in September 2001,  it  was  strongly
argued that today, more than ever, knowledge is  power,  and  that  MPs  who
have an instant access to the  world  of  information  would  become  better
representatives of the people.

MPs  present  at  that  conference  were  urged  to  become  knowledge-based
parliamentarians. Parliaments were encouraged to set up networks  throughout
their respective societies so  that  their  members  could  operate  at  the
centre of a web of electronic links to community, business and other  groups
in society.

Nearer home, at the ANC National Conference  in  Stellenbosch,  in  December
2002, to be precise, it was noted that ``communications play  a  major  role
in deepening our democracy, promoting a culture of human  rights  and  is  a
key pillar in the transformation of our country''.

There is therefore sufficient consensus abroad, as well as nationally,  that
information and communication technology, or ICT as it is  popularly  known,
both empowers MPs  to  become  better  representatives  of  the  people  and
provides for more effective and more accessible public participation in  the
processes of Parliament. I would like to argue that although Parliament  and
Government have done a lot to utilise ICT in its  policies  and  programmes,
we may not have done so sufficiently to ensure that the institution and  the
MPs, which serve the institution, are properly connected to the people,  and
that the people are properly connected to Parliament through ICT.

Most certainly MPs have been supplied with  laptops,  an  attempt  has  been
made to bring constituency offices online as far as the Internet and  e-mail
are concerned, and Parliament Live does appear for two hours on SABC  3  and
for a lengthier period of time on DSTV. But can we really say that  we  have
connected with the people through our public information system?

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Please  colleagues,  you  can
continue with your conversations, but lower your voices.

While  significant  progress  has  been  made  since  1994  in   eliminating
historical  disparities  and  inequalities  in  our  society,  we  have  the
situation in  South  Africa  where  white  people  are  still  predominately
wealthy, while, in comparison, blacks  are  still  predominately  poor.  You
therefore have a section of South African society with unlimited  access  to
cyberspace, that owns computers and is online,  and  whose  televisions  are
linked to satellites. Then you have another section  of  society  that  does
not have TV, a computer  or  Internet  access,  let  alone  DSTV,  on  which
Parliament Live is being broadcast. Any ICT programme in  our  country  will
have to apply itself to addressing the challenge of  wealth  versus  poverty
in order to ensure the  continuous  development  of  policies  that  promote
universal availability of and access to ICTs and ICT-based services.

The  strong  view  was  expressed  at  the  ANC  National  Conference   that
Government  should  increase  access  to  the  ICT  sector   of   previously
disadvantaged communities,  and  encourage  co-ordination  of  existing  ICT
initiatives such  as  telecentres  and  multipurpose  centres.  One  of  the
technologies, no doubt, which assists in providing  access  of  the  broader
community  to  the  Internet,  e-mail  and  e-government,  is   the   Public
Information Terminals, or PITs as they are generally known. These  PITs  are
situated in Post Offices and multipurpose community  centres  in  the  rural
areas in particular, and enable communities to  visit  and  access  websites
anywhere in the world, to access Parliament's  websites  in  particular,  to
have an e-mail address and write a message  to  anyone  who  has  an  e-mail
address anywhere in the world.

These PITs would  enable  the  public  to  make  electronic  submissions  to
committees and to communicate directly with the  members  of  Parliament.  I
just wonder how many people  know  about  these  PITs.  Perhaps  we  require
proper marketing of these things. These PITs  are  those  little  red  boxes
that stand in Post Offices that look like post boxes, actually.  But,  I  do
think we should market them properly.

Chair, it  is  also  very  encouraging  that  Parliament  has  developed  an
interactive website in order to make  parliamentary  information  as  easily
accessible as possible to the various groups of South African  stakeholders,
both inside and outside Parliament, and  to  maximise  the  opportunity  for
public input using  online  technologies.  This  website  can  obviously  be
accessed  through  the  PITs  and  certainly  goes  a  long  way  in  making
Parliament accessible to communities through IT.

Voorsitter, die ANC se nasionale kongres was ook  van  die  opinie  dat  die
openbare uitsaaier die publiek moet inlig oor die werk van die Regering,  én
dat dit 'n rol moet speel om die deelname van ons mense  aan  die  Parlement
te verseker. In hierdie verband dink 'n mens  in  die  besonder  aan  radio,
aangesien  die  draadloos  baie  meer  mense  bereik  as  televisie  of  die
Internet. Dit is van uiterste belang dat die Parlement  boodskappe  oor  die
radio adverteer om ons  mense  in  te  lig  oor  die  werksaamhede  van  die
Parlement.

Hierdie boodskappe moet ook in alle landstale gekommunikeer word.  Die  mees
inspirerende boodskap wat op mense 'n indruk maak, is daardie  boodskap  wat
in hul moedertaal gelewer  word.  As  Afrikaanssprekende  Afrikaan,  wie  se
radio ingestel is op 'n tweetalige program met 'n sterk  Afrikaanse  inslag,
spits my ore onwillekeurig as ek 'n boodskap in Afrikaans  hoor.  Daarom  is
ek oortuig daarvan dat ons boodskappe of nuus  van  die  Parlement  in  alle
landstale moet uitsaai.

Die ANC  se  kongres  was  ook  van  mening  dat  die  Parlement  eenvoudige
verduidelikings in verstaanbare taal in sy dokumente  moet  vervat.  Ek  het
byvoorbeeld hier by my, en  van  u  sal  die  pamflette  herken,  'n  aantal
dokumente  oor  die  Parlement.  Hierdie  dokumente  is  kort   en   bondige
beskrywings van hoe ons demokrasie werk, dit is in 'n  aantreklike  formaat,
en dit kan maklik in 'n binnesak  of  handsak  deur  lede  van  die  publiek
geplaas word. Hierdie dokument kom in alle landstale voor.

Wat Parliament Live aanbetref, wat 'n tydsgleuf  het  op  beide  SABC  3  en
DSTV, is dit belangrik dat ons ook hier 'n eenvoudiger  aanbieding  kry  van
die verrigtinge van die Parlement. Ek dink nie ons mense wil altyd  na  lang
toesprake van die parlementariërs op televisie luister nie.  Daarom  is  dit
van uiterste belang vir ons om ook eenvoudiger  en  meer  ontspanne  kykstof
aan kykers op televisie te bied ten einde hul belangstelling te behou.

Voorsitter, ek weet nie hoe waar  dit  is  dat  die  SABC  die  parlementêre
kanaal van SABC 3 wil afhaal nie, maar ons sal ten alle koste moet keer  dat
dit gebeur. Terwyl ek pas gesê het dat ons moet toesien dat die formaat  van
die aanbiedings verander,  is  ek  'n  sterk  voorstander  daarvan  dat  die
parlementêre kanaal op TV behoue moet bly. Dit  sal  'n  ernstige  terugslag
wees vir ons kommunikasie- en tegnologieprogram as ons nie die werk van  die
Parlement oor televisie aan die massas kan beeldsend  nie.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, the ANC's national congress was also of the opinion  that  the
public broadcaster must inform the public of the work of the Government  and
that it must play a role in ensuring the  participation  of  our  people  in
Parliament. In this regard one thinks of the radio in particular, since  the
radio reaches far more people than television or the Internet. It is of  the
utmost importance for Parliament to  advertise  messages  on  the  radio  to
inform our people of the activities of Parliament.

These messages must also be communicated  in  all  official  languages.  The
most inspiring message which makes an impression on people is  that  message
which is conveyed in their mother tongue. As an Afrikaans-speaking  African,
whose radio is tuned into a bilingual programme with a  strong  emphasis  on
Afrikaans,  I  involuntarily  prick  my  ears  when  I  hear  a  message  in
Afrikaans. For that reason I am convinced that we  must  broadcast  messages
or news of Parliament in all official languages.
The ANC's congress was also of the  opinion  that  Parliament  must  include
simple  explanations  in  understandable  language  in  its  documents.  For
example, I have here with me, and some of you will recognise the  pamphlets,
a number of documents on Parliament. The documents  are  short  and  concise
descriptions of how our democracy works, they are in  an  attractive  format
and they can easily be put into an inside pocket or a handbag by members  of
the public. This document is available in all official languages.

Regarding Parliament Live, which has a time-slot on both SABC  3  and  DSTV,
it is important that  here  also  we  get  a  simpler  presentation  of  the
proceedings of Parliament. I do not think that our  people  always  want  to
listen to long speeches by parliamentarians on television. It  is  therefore
of the utmost importance for us to provide  our  viewers  with  simpler  and
more relaxed viewing material in order to retain their interest.

Chairperson, I do not know how true it is that the SABC wants to remove  the
parliamentary channel from SABC 3, but we will have  to  prevent  this  from
happening at all costs. Whereas I have just said that we  must  ensure  that
the format of our presentations is changed, I am strongly in favour  of  the
parliamentary channel being retained on TV. It will be  a  serious  set-back
for our communication and technology programme if we  cannot  broadcast  the
work of Parliament to the masses on television.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson, the world has turned into a global village  in
which information has to be communicated with minimum delay. It  has  become
necessary for Parliament to disseminate and access information very fast.

The internet has come in very  handy  for  legislators.  They  are  able  to
access information from webpages across the globe.  Civil  society  is  kept
informed about all that is happening in Parliament while in their  homes  or
offices. The use of the e-mail also assists  in  accelerating  communication
in written form. While fast, the medium is also user and ozone friendly,  as
it is paperless in the main.
For MPs an added advantage of the internet is that they  are  able  to  zoom
into the sites of departments and thus continue their oversight function  of
Parliament.

 Members of  the  public  are  able  to  participate  in  the  parliamentary
deliberations  by  accessing  legislation,  order  papers,  compositions  of
committees, parties  represented  in  Parliament,  including  their  elected
representatives on the website.

Departments such as Education and Public Service and Administration, and  of
late Agriculture, have gone the extra mile by having  their  annual  reports
on CD-rom. The gadget enables an individual to have a  bird's  eye  view  of
the activities of the departments by  merely  pressing  the  button  and  or
scrolling up and down. Access to information could not have been  made  much
easier than that.

It gives much pain, however, when at times it becomes  difficult  to  access
the webpage of Parliament. Hopefully the commissioning of a  high  level  e-
business strategy that is currently underway, will allow for  easier  access
to the parliamentary website. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chair. The MF  notes  the  importance  of
transparency  in  this  democracy.  Further  it   is   felt   that   to   be
representative of a people and part of the Government that has been  put  in
place by the people for the people, the importance that this debate puts  to
the House is crucial.

A harsh reality  though  is  that  we  have  a  citizenry  that  is  largely
illiterate. Further poverty hinders the accessibility  to  modern  forms  of
communication such as the internet, where Parliament has a website.

The MF finds the website to be an  efficient  database,  keeping  the  South
African population abreast of all our activities and  content.  However,  as
mentioned earlier, there are factors that do not allow the greater  majority
to do so.

Though the media represent a  form  of  keeping  the  people  in  touch  and
informed of Parliament's activities, we should not rely on this form  noting
that mediarised collections of events at times  camouflage  or  distort  the
reality of the situation. Parliament Live is also  an  important  means  but
once again, how many South Africans actually have access to televisions?  It
is also important to note that it is broadcast during hours  when  most  are
at work and may not have the luxury or ability to  watch  whilst  completing
their tasks.

The MF feels that there are many factors that minimise our ability to  reach
our citizenry efficiently and effectively. Ways to bring the public more  up
to date with Parliament in a cost-effective manner should  be  done  and  is
supported.

The MF supports the need of connecting people to Parliament via  information
and communication technology. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Chairperson, the hon Cassim, that is you, Sir,  said  that  you
were going to make the most important speech in  Parliament,  but  you  lost
the opportunity because you did not announce  that  you  were  crossing  the
floor to the National Action. [Laughter.]

Regarding the  matter  of  the  internet  and  IT  technology,  it  is  very
important and we support that we discuss it. I must  warn  that  we  do  not
overemphasise this.

Daar is niks wat die persoonlike kontak van 'n LP en sy  mense  kan  vervang
nie. Daar is niks wat die voetwerk wat teenwoordig moet  wees,  kan  vervang
nie. Ons sit met 'n Catch 22-situasie. Ons wil hê hulle moet  meer  van  die
Parlement vir die mense wys, maar hoe meer ons die Parlement wys,  hoe  meer
sien hulle die leë banke. So hoe meer ons wys, hoe slegter  word  ons  naam.
Ons moet eerstens die eie Huis in orde kry en kyk dat  ons  ons  werk  doen;
kyk dat  daar  iets  is  om  te  wys  en  kyk  dat  ons  gereeld  ons  mense
verteenwoordig en doen waarvoor ons gekies is.

'n Mens kan die Internet ook oorlaai. 'n Mens kan  e-posse  ook  oorlaai  en
die feit is so dat e-posse kom en gaan en naderhand steur jy  jou  nie  meer
daaraan nie. Belangrike sake is dat ons bekommerd is oor ons beeld na  buite
en ons kommunikasie na buite. Ons stuur die arme mense  van  die  persgalery
uit die parlementêre terrein uit om doer anderkant in 'n gebou te gaan  sit.
As ons ernstig is, sal ons  daardie  mense  terugbring  en  hier  laat  bly.
Verder  sal  Ministers  dan  meer  hul  belangrike  verklarings  vanuit  die
Parlement maak en nie vanuit Pretoria op 'n afstand nie.

Ek pleit ook vir die terugkom van die program On Camera,  Sondagaande  kwart
voor 10 op SABC 3. Dit het 'n mooi beeld van  die  Parlement  gegee  en  die
hoogtepunte van die week is gewys. Dit het verval. Kom ons gebruik  dan  ook
ons tegnologie om 'n  beter  vertaaldiens  hier  te  kry,  dat  die  oomblik
wanneer ek hier in Afrikaans praat, u in u eie  taal  alles  kan  hoor.  Ons
vergelyk dit met die kriekettoernooi: Ons het krieket gekyk toe  Suid-Afrika
gewen het. Die oomblik toe ons verloor het, is daar nie meer  belangstelling
nie. Kom ons maak van ons Parlement 'n wenspan en  dan  sal  die  mense  ook
belangstel om te hoor wat  ons  sê.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[There is nothing that can replace the personal contact of  an  MP  and  his
people. There is nothing that  can  replace  the  footwork  that  should  be
present. We sit with a Catch 22 situation. We want  them  to  show  more  of
Parliament to the people; but the more we show  Parliament,  the  more  they
see the empty seats. So, the more we show, the worse our  name  becomes.  We
must firstly get our own House in order and see that we  do  our  work;  see
that there is something to show and that we regularly represent  our  people
and do what we have been elected for.

One can also overload the Internet. One can overload e-mails  and  the  fact
is that e-mails come and  go  and  later  you  do  not  notice  it  anymore.
Important issues are that we are concerned about our image  to  the  outside
and our communication towards the outside. We send the poor  people  of  the
press gallery out of the parliamentary terrain to go and sit in  a  building
way over there. If we are serious, we would bring those people back and  let
them  remain  here.  Furthermore,  Ministers  will  then  deliver  important
statements from Parliament and not from a distance in Pretoria.

I also plead for the return of the programme On Camera  on  Sunday  evenings
at a quarter to ten on SABC 3. It presented a  fine  picture  of  Parliament
and showed the highlights of the week. It has been  discontinued.  Come  let
us also use our technology to get a  better  translation  service  here,  so
that the minute I speak Afrikaans here, you can hear everything in your  own
language. We are comparing  it  with  the  cricket  tournament.  We  watched
cricket when South Africa was winning. The moment we lost there was  a  loss
of interest. Come, let us make a winning team of  our  Parliament  and  then
the people will also be interested to hear what he have to say.]

Mr C M LOWE: Chairperson, and thank you to all our colleagues who  sat  here
so patiently waiting for my speech this afternoon. Deputy Chair,  a  lot  of
words have been exchanged here this afternoon and  I  have  asked  to  speak
especially in this debate to suggest something practical that  can  be  done
immediately to make parliamentarians more accessible to  people  and  people
more accessible to Parliament. And that is the question of the  use  of  our
Internet and our e-mail.

Now you said that you do not have a cellphone, so I do not know if you  have
a laptop or a computer, but  for  those  of  you  here  who  do  have  those
facilities, you will know just how long and how difficult it  is  to  access
your e-mails and send e-mails. Now virtually every  NGO  we  interact  with,
many organisations, lots of people and individuals communicate  with  us  by
means of an e-mail. It is just the way things happen these  days  and  we  -
and most of my colleagues and colleagues in other parties too - use that  e-
mail facility. I am not an IT specialist at all. I  do  not  know  what  the
terms and technology are that we should refer  to,  but  quite  simply,  the
width of the band is not wide enough and you find that it takes up  to  five
days to download your e-mails. That is totally  unacceptable  and  it  is  a
situation where people literally cannot  get  in  contact  with  us.  I  see
people nodding around and it is happening now. Let us take some of  that  EU
money or other money  and  let  us  spend  it,  not  on  just  training  for
training's sake, but on widening the width of the band for communication  by
means of e-mails.

Let us give more power to the IT department. The help  desk,  with  respect,
is  no  help  at  all.  If  anybody  has  ever  phoned  up  IT,   they   are
undercapacitated, overworked, they are on leave and  they  cannot  help.  We
simply are not able to do our jobs properly. In the year and a half since  I
have been here there has been absolutely  no  improvement.  We  have  simply
been told that it is coming, it will be another two months and  nothing  has
happened.

Deputy Chair, I would ask you that if we do one thing,  we  deal  with  that
and we do it very quickly. Let us  utilise  funds  and  empower  members.  I
would also like to suggest that the parliamentary website,  which  is  good,
is also used to put  Hansard  onto  and  to  record  members'  questions  to
Ministers and replies there too. That would  be  a  very  good  use  of  the
parliamentary website.

I think I have run out of time. I would also like to let  you  know,  Deputy
Chairperson, if you would like a copy of my speech I would be very  glad  to
give one to you. [Applause.]

Mr E N NGCOBO: Chair, I heard some members inferring that the Government  is
probably engaged in replacing the communications system  as  currently  used
by the information systems ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, you  are  speaking
much louder than the gentleman at the podium. You may proceed, hon member.

Mr E N NGCOBO: I think that the aim of the Government  in  introducing  this
Government  Communications  and  Information  System,  is   to   provide   a
comprehensive communications  system  on  behalf  of  Government  so  as  to
facilitate the participation of  the  majority  of  South  Africans  in  the
process of governance, reconstruction and development,  nation-building  and
reconciliation processes. This must  be  clear;  it  is  not  replacing  the
presently used information systems.

It is an indisputable fact  that  knowledge  in  our  modern  society  is  a
critical component to production, and hence access to it  represents  a  key
divide between the rich and the poor. It is therefore  the  single  duty  of
every patriotic South African across the political party divide to  work  to
support the current ANC-led Government's initiative which  seeks  to  ensure
that access to information relating to governance in particular is  afforded
to every South African citizen.

An  increasing  portion  of  the  world's  production  and  trade   involves
information and the exchange of information. The changes  brought  about  by
an information economy are profound and arguably  as  significant  as  those
brought about by the Industrial Revolution. These will affect the  lives  of
everyone, including those not directly involved. This is the reason why  the
UN  Secretary-General,  in  concluding  his  Millennium  Report,   correctly
captures these arguments:


  Finally, the corporate in this sector, meaning  information,  has  unique
  attributes nurtured by others. The steel used to construct  buildings  or
  the goods worn by the workers  constructing  it  cannot  be  consumed  by
  anyone else. Information is different.  Not  only  is  it  available  for
  multiple uses and users but it also becomes more valuable the more it  is
  used. The same is true of the networks that link up different sources  of
  information. We in the policy-making world need to understand better  how
  the economics of information differ  from  the  economics  of  inherently
  scarce fiscal goods and use it to advance our policy goals.

But, the UN Sustainable  Development  Networking  Programme  further  argues
that information and communications have become an  essential  component  of
the  development  process  itself,  since  information  and   communications
technologies are now fundamental to dealing with all the development  issues
in developing countries.

It  is  with  support   to   the   above-mentioned   internationally   based
communications  development  strategies  that  our  ANC-led  Government  has
decided that the time has come when Parliament and the people it  represents
must find a convergence point via information and communications  technology
initiative. The Government has a vision that, locally, this initiative  will
make South Africa's future generation become a knowledge-based  society  and
hence will help create an information economy. The latter is expected to  be
achieved by establishing a network information community to empower the  way
people work, live and play whilst at  the  same  time  it  will  make  South
Africa globally competitive. This will no doubt improve the quality of  life
of all South Africans. Such  a  universal  service  is  expected  to  enable
people to have access  not  only  to  traditional  media  but  also  to  the
convenience  of  information  technology,  which  is  at   the   centre   of
accelerating human resource development and hence  economic  growth  of  the
nation.

Some of the key objectives and programmes of  this  communications  strategy
are to set  up  a  new  government  communications  system  as  well  as  to
transform  existing  communications  functions  in  Government,  which  will
culminate in departments being  tasked  with  responsibilities  of  managing
communications channels between Government and  the  public  through  direct
dialogue, especially with communities in disadvantaged areas.

 Communications strategies and programmes for the whole  Government  at  the
national level as well as communications operations of all departments  will
find expression through this communications  initiative  strategies.  It  is
hoped that this communications system  will  help  foster  a  more  positive
communications environment which will result in  a  clear  understanding  of
the information needs of the public as well as of Government as a whole.

One may ask: How will these above-mentioned goals be  achieved  in  advanced
technology defined terms with our future  generations?  We  should  consider
possibilities  and  momentary  assumptions  as  captured  in  the  following
scenarios in addressing the present question: Firstly, suppose  we  classify
the telecommunications system as  modern  technological  extensions  of  the
postal system, as currently known  where  these  would  be  subsidised  with
public funds in much the same way as  say  public  transport  and  highways;
secondly, we use public funds to supply each new existing  residential  unit
with  telephone  connections  and  microcomputer  terminals  of   acceptable
capacity; thirdly, we equip the existing  postal  facilities  with  a  video
studio receiving dish  and  satellite  application;  fourthly,  we  dedicate
radio frequencies and fibre optic lines for  public  affairs  communications
channels; fifthly,  we  install  and  maintain  a  national  public  affairs
information main frame computer which would be accessible  through  an  0800
toll free number; and sixthly, we provide access to this  system  through  a
magnetically stripped social security card or an  access  code  assigned  to
each voter upon registration.

With such a system in place, each voter or citizen would have access  to  an
interactive public affairs system which would allow individuals to read  all
Government documents and reports from a central video tax computer. It  will
allow entering of any written  expressions  of  fact  or  opinion  into  the
system for reading by other citizens. It  will  record  and  transmit  their
opinions of video tapes for storage in central  public  affairs  video  tape
data bank and it will be able to select and play  video  presentations  from
other citizens and officials entered in the same manner.

So, this is how this information system, if  developed,  will  be  used.  No
doubt such a system would eliminate any need for  a  legislative  branch  or
structure of government in the  vicinity  since  the  technology  of  direct
democracy would allow each voter to decide issues  personally  and  vote  on
any legislative proposal  entered  on  the  national  agenda  by  electronic
initiative petition of the eligible voters. Even the actual voting  on  each
proposal could be announced well in advance on a  dedicated  public  affairs
channel whilst the teller could remain open for a 24-hour period, etc.

In a nutshell, as envisaged by our ANC-led Government, the benefits of  such
information  communications  technology  system  are  as  follows:  It  will
provide excellent media and communications services to Government;  it  will
make Government information centres and multiple community centres  critical
elements  of  Government  communications;  it  will  assist  in   developing
Government media, communications and  information  policy;  it  will  ensure
excellent and efficient service to the media; it  will  produce  information
products  for  dissemination  to  citizens,  co-ordinate  the  international
marketing of South Africa whilst  simultaneously  transforming  the  mindset
and   positive   cultural   outlook   of   society   both   internally   and
internationally; it will continually transform the  communications  strategy
and develop its  management  and  employees  to  meet  the  demands  of  its
mandate;  and  it  will  economically  benefit  society  as  the   mode   of
communication shifts from cellphone-based to  Internet-based,  almost  cost-
free systems.

This is the  strategy  which  the  Government  seeks  to  augment  into  the
presently used communications systems. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly:

1.    First Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Commmittee  on  Public  Accounts,  having  considered  the
     Report of the  Auditor-General  on  the  Financial  Statements  of  the
     Zoological Gardens of South Africa for the year ended  31  March  2002,
     tabled on 5 September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management of the Zoological Gardens  of
         South Africa for the unqualified audit  opinion  expressed  by  the
         Auditor-General, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
         equally unqualified.


         The Committee, however, notes that the Auditor-General  has  raised
         several issues of concern.


     2.     Investments


         The Committee notes that the Zoological Gardens incurred a loss  on
         an investment held  in  a  private  bank,  which  was  subsequently
         placed under curatorship.


         Through intervention of the South African Reserve  Bank,  the  loss
         was reduced to R60 277 at 31 March  2002.  The  Zoological  Gardens
         received an interim distribution of 44  cents  in  the  Rand  on  8
         April 2002. The  Committee  recommends  that  the  management  make
         every  attempt  to  recover  the  outstanding  balance   from   the
         appointed curator, and that funds be securely invested in future.


     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual   Report   and   Financial
         Statements were tabled in Parliament on 5 September 2002.


         This late tabling constitutes non-compliance with section  65(1)(a)
         of the Public Finance Management Act.


         The Committee recommends that  the  management  of  the  Zoological
         Gardens strictly adhere to the relevant sections  of  the  PFMA  at
         all times.


     4.     Going concern


         The Committee also notes that the  Zoological  Gardens  is  totally
         dependent for its funding  on  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,
         Science and Technology. They must explain  by  30  April  2003  why
         funds cannot be generated from patrons of the Zoological Gardens.


     5.     Decision on hearing


         Because the audit opinion is unqualified, the Committee  recommends
         that no hearing be held for the financial year under review.


     Report to be considered.

2.    Second Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Commmittee  on  Public  Accounts,  having  considered  the
     Report of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements  of  the  War
     Museum of the Boer Republics for the year ended 31 March  2002,  tabled
     on 4 September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion
         The Committee commends the management of  the  War  Museum  of  the
         Boer Republics for the unqualified audit opinion expressed  by  the
         Auditor-General, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
         equally unqualified.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual  Report  was   tabled   in
         Parliament  on  4  September  2002,   thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     Decision on hearing


         Because the Auditor-General has not cited any  issues  of  concern,
         the Committee recommends that no hearing be held for the  financial
         year under review.


     Report to be considered.

3.    Third Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements of the South African
     Heritage Resources Agency for the year ended 31 March 2002 [RP 125-02],
     tabled on 4 September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The  Committee  commends  the  management  of  the  South   African
         Heritage  Resources  Agency  for  the  unqualified  audit   opinion
         expressed by the Auditor-General,  and  trusts  that  future  audit
         opinions will be equally unqualified.


         The  Committee,  however,  notes  that  the   Auditor-General   has
         emphasised several issues of concern.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual  Report  was   tabled   in
         Parliament  on  4  September  2002,   thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     Late submission of financial statements


         The Committee notes that signed financial statements, submitted  to
         the Auditor-General's Office on 14  June  2002,  contained  several
         over-  and  understatements,  which  were  referred  back  to   the
         management. These were subsequently adjusted and resubmitted on  26
         July 2002.


         The Committee recommends that  management  avoid  a  recurrence  of
         this lapse in 2003.


     4.     Property, plant and equipment


         *  The  financial  statements  do  not  disclose  the  movement  of
           assets, as required in terms of GAAP.


         *  Depreciation for additions were calculated for  the  full  year,
           irrespective of the actual purchase date.


         The  Committee  recommends  that  management   ensure   that   GAAP
         requirements are adhered to and  that  depreciation  is  calculated
         correctly.


     5.     Decision on hearing


         The Committee recommends that no hearing be held for the  financial
         year under review.


     Report to be considered.

4.    Fourth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements of Business and Arts
     South Africa for the year ended 31 March 2002, tabled  on  9  September
     2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management of Business  and  Arts  South
         Africa for the unqualified audit opinion expressed by the  Auditor-
         General, and trusts that future  audit  opinions  will  be  equally
         unqualified.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual  Report  was   tabled   in
         Parliament  on  9  September  2002,   thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     Decision on hearing
         The Auditor-General has not  cited  any  issues  of  concern  which
         would warrant further consideration.


         The Committee therefore recommends that no hearing be held for  the
         financial year under review.


     Report to be considered.

5.    Fifth Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial  Statements  of  the  Engelburg
     House Art Collection for the year ended 31 March  2002,  tabled  on  30
     September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management of the  Engelburg  House  Art
         Collection for the  unqualified  audit  opinion  expressed  by  the
         Auditor-General, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
         equally unqualified.


     2.     Late submission


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual  Report  was   tabled   in
         Parliament  on  30  September  2002,  thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     Internal audit


         The Committee notes that, due to the  limited  activities  of  this
         organisation, an internal audit department and an  audit  committee
         were not established for the past  two  financial  years.  This  is
         contrary to the provisions of the Public Finance Management Act.


         The Committee recommends  that  management  attend  to  this  issue
         urgently and that the Auditor-General report thereon  in  his  next
         Report.


     4.     Decision on hearing


         The Committee recommends that no hearing be held for the  financial
         year under review.


     Report to be considered.

6.    Sixth Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements of the Freedom  Park
     Trust for the year ended  31  March  2002  [RP  141-02],  tabled  on  4
     September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management of  the  Freedom  Park  Trust
         for  the  unqualified  audit  opinion  expressed  by  the  Auditor-
         General, and trusts that future  audit  opinions  will  be  equally
         unqualified.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual  Report  was   tabled   in
         Parliament  on  4  September  2002,   thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     Late submission of financial statements


         The Committee notes that  signed  financial  statements  were  only
         submitted on 12 July 2002, and not 31 May 2002,  as  prescribed  by
         the PFMA.


         The Committee recommends that  management  avoid  a  recurrence  of
         this matter in 2003.


     4.     Decision on hearing


         The Committee recommends that no hearing be held for the  financial
         year under review.


     Report to be considered.

7.    Seventh Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements  of  the  Pan  South
     African Language Board for the year ended 31 March  2002  [RP  166-02],
     tabled on 16 September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management  of  the  Pan  South  African
         Language Board for the unqualified audit opinion expressed  by  the
         Auditor-General, and trusts that  future  audit  opinions  will  be
         equally unqualified.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The  Committee  notes  that  the  Annual  Report  was   tabled   in
         Parliament  on  16  September  2002,  thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     Decision on hearing


         The Committee recommends that no hearing be held for the  financial
         year under review.


     Report to be considered.

8.    Eighth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements and Group  Financial
     Statements of the South African Bureau of Standards for the year  ended
     31 March 2002, tabled in Parliament on 12 September 2002  and  referred
     to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The  Committee  commends   the   accounting   authority   for   the
         unqualified audit  opinion  expressed  by  the  Auditor-General  in
         respect of the financial audit as well as the audit of  performance
         information. The Committee trusts that  audit  opinions  in  future
         will be equally unqualified.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee notes that  the  SABS  Annual  Report  and  Financial
         Statements were tabled in Parliament on 12 September 2002.


         This late tabling constitutes non-compliance with section  65(1)(a)
         of the Public Finance Management Act.


     3.     Accounts receivable (SABS)
         The Committee notes with concern that:


         *  Accounts receivable are not followed up on a  regular  basis  to
           ensure timeous recovery thereof.


         *  67% of the accounts receivable were outstanding for longer  than
           120 days, whereas the SABS normal repayment terms  are  30  days
           only.


         *  The provision for doubtful  debts  is  currently  in  excess  of
           R10,5 million, which represents 49%  of  the  total  outstanding
           amounts and which seems unacceptably high to the Committee.


         The Committee recommends, in terms of section  51(1)(b)(i)  of  the
         PFMA, that the accounting authority take effective and  appropriate
         steps to collect all amounts timeously.


         The Committee further  recommends  that  the  accounting  authority
         furnish  Parliament  with  a   progress   report   on   the   above
         recommendation by 30 April 2003.


     4.     Hearing


         Having considered the Report,  the  Committee  recommends  that  no
         hearing be held on the South African Bureau of  Standards  for  the
         financial year under review.


     Report to be considered.

9.    Ninth Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Annual
     Report, including the Report of the Auditor-General  on  the  Financial
     Statements, of the Financial and Fiscal Commission for the  year  ended
     31 March 2002 [RP 132-02], tabled in Parliament on 28 August  2002  and
     referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee  commends  the  Chairperson  and  management  of  the
         Financial and Fiscal Commission (FFC)  for  the  unqualified  audit
         opinion expressed by the Auditor-General, and  trusts  that  future
         audit opinions will be equally unqualified.


     2.     Emphasis of Matter


         The Committee notes that the Auditor-General has raised  one  issue
         of concern under "Emphasis of  Matter".  This  issue  requires  the
         attention of  management,  and  the  Committee  deals  with  it  in
         paragraph 4 below.


     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee  commends  the  management  of  the  FFC  for  having
         timeously tabled its Annual Report, thereby complying with  section
         65(1)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act.


     4.     Internal audit


         The Committee notes:


         *  That the FFC obtained Treasury approval on 22 October  2002  for
           sharing the internal audit function with National Treasury.


         *  That the internal audit function was not operational during  the
           financial  year  under  review  because  National  Treasury  had
           obtained exemption until 30 April 2002.


         *  That at the time of completing its Report (June 2002),  the  FFC
           was  still  waiting  for  Treasury  to  complete  its   internal
           processes of contracting an appropriate service provider.


         Since the Committee considers the  establishment  of  the  internal
         audit function as vital for the development of a  fraud  prevention
         plan, necessary for the  detection  and  prevention  of  fraud,  it
         trusts that this outstanding matter will be resolved speedily,  and
         recommends that the Auditor-General  report  thereon  in  his  next
         report on the FFC.


     5.     Matters arising from management report


         (a)     State of financial affairs


              The Committee notes:


              *   That the accounts reflect a net surplus of R422 963, which
                has been earmarked for capital expenditure during the  2002-
                03 financial year.


              *   That estimates suggest a more sustainable budget level for
                the FFC to be in the region of R10 million per annum.


              *   That a significant part of the expenditure is  related  to
                personnel, together with the contracting in of  researchers,
                analysts and various experts, whose inputs are essential  to
                the FFC.


         (b)     IT-server network


              The Committee notes that the revamping of the FFC's  IT-server
              network was originally earmarked for implementation during the
              2001-02 financial year, but that the implementation will  only
              be effected during the 2002-03 financial year.


              The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Auditor-General  report
              thereon in his next report on the FFC.


     6.     Decision on hearing


         Having considered the Report of the  Auditor-General,  as  well  as
         having dealt with  the  Matter  of  Emphasis  raised  by  him,  the
         Committee recommends that no hearing be held on the  Financial  and
         Fiscal Commission for the financial year under review.


     Report to be considered.

10.   Tenth Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated  5
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Annual
     Report, including the Report of the Auditor-General  on  the  Financial
     Statements, of the Financial Services Board (FSB) for the year ended 31
     March 2002, tabled in Parliament on 28 August 2002 and referred to  it,
     reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the Board  of  the  FSB  and  the  Executive
         Officer for the unqualified audit opinion expressed by the Auditor-
         General, and trusts that future  audit  opinions  will  be  equally
         unqualified.


     2.     Emphasis of Matter


         The Committee notes, and  welcomes  the  fact,  that  the  Auditor-
         General has not raised any issues of  concern  under  "Emphasis  of
         Matter".


     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee  commends  the  management  of  the  FSB  for  having
         timeously tabled its Annual Report, thereby complying with  section
         65(1)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act.


     4.     Insider Trading Directorate (ITD)


         The Committee notes:


         * That since its inception in January 1999, the ITD has logged  136
           cases for investigation,  of  which  100  have  been  finalised,
           resulting in a decision to institute  legal  proceedings  in  20
           cases, of which 13 have been settled out of court.


         *  That the FSB will  increase  its  resources  to  deal  with  the
           backlog of outstanding cases.


         *  That during  the  year  under  review,  the  ITD  considered  22
           investigation reports, of which four were settled out of court.


         *  That in terms of the settlement, the FSB received  R5,4  million
           which, after the recovery of costs, was distributed to investors
           prejudiced by insider trading.


         The Committee  commends  the  progress  made  thus  far  and  looks
         forward to the additional  resources  being  allocated  to  provide
         further improvement in efficiency.


     5.     Chairperson's review


         The  Committee  notes  that,   in   the   environment   of   recent
         conglomerate  failures  and  other  factors,  the  shortcomings  of
         corporate governance, more specifically the  duties  of  directors,
         should increasingly  receive  attention  from  the  FSB  (also  the
         responsibilities of auditors).


     6.     Internal controls


         The Committee notes and welcomes the following aspects in  relation
         to internal controls:


         *  That management maintains a  comprehensive  system  of  internal
           controls.


         *  That these controls include  a  risk-based  system  of  internal
           accounting  and  administrative  controls  designed  to  provide
           reasonable   assurance   that   assets   are   safeguarded   and
           transactions executed and recorded in accordance with  generally
           accepted  business  practices  and  the  Board's  policies   and
           practices.


         *  That these controls  are  implemented  by  trained  and  skilled
           personnel with an appropriate segregation of duties.


         *   That  monitoring  by  management   includes   a   comprehensive
           budgeting and reporting system operating within strict deadlines
           and an appropriate control framework.
         *   That  the  internal  audit   function   conducts   operational,
           financial and specific audits and  co-ordinates  audit  coverage
           with the external auditors.


     7.     Decision on hearing


         Having  noted  the  unqualified  audit  opinion  expressed  by  the
         Auditor-General, the Committee recommends that no hearing  be  held
         on the Financial  Services  Board  for  the  financial  year  under
         review.


     Report to be considered.

11.   Eleventh Report of the Standing Committee on  Public  Accounts,  dated
     25 February 2003:


     The Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts,  having  considered  the
     Report, including the Annual Report of the Independent Auditors of  the
     Financial Statements,  of  the  Development  Bank  of  Southern  Africa
     Limited for the year ended 31 March 2002, tabled  in  Parliament  on  5
     September 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The  Committee  commends  the  management  of  the  DBSA  for   the
         unqualified audit opinion expressed by  the  Independent  Auditors,
         and trusts that future audit opinions will be equally unqualified.


     2.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee notes that the DBSA's Annual  Report  was  tabled  in
         Parliament  on  5  September  2002,   thereby   constituting   non-
         compliance with section 65(1)(a) of the Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     3.     General matters


         (a)     Risk management


              The Committee notes that:
              *   A risk management framework is being implemented  for  the
                entire  Bank,  which  will   consolidate   risk   management
                oversight to include all risk categories across all business
                and functional areas.


              *   It  is  anticipated  that  the  framework  will  be  fully
                operational during the next financial year.


         (b)     Internal audit


              The Committee notes that the DBSA's Internal Audit Unit:


              *    Aims  to  be  an  independent,  objective  assurance  and
                consulting service to  add  value  and  improve  the  Bank's
                operations.


              *   Reports directly to the Managing Director.


              *   Has unlimited access to the Chairperson of both the  Board
                and the Audit Committee.


              *   as considered the strategic impact of changes  within  the
                bank and its operating environment.


         (c)     External audit


              The Committee recommends that the CEO indicate the  extent  to
              which external auditors of the DBSA provide consulting  and/or
              advisory services to the Bank.


     4.     Conclusion


         Having noted some  issues  of  special  concern,  which  are  being
         addressed, and as the Report is unqualified, the  Committee  is  of
         the view  that  no  hearing  is  necessary  on  the  DBSA  for  the
         financial year under review.


     Report to be considered.

12.   Twelfth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, dated  25
     February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General on the Financial Statements of the Energy Sector
     Education and Training Authority [ESETA] for the year  ended  31  March
     2002 [RP 98-02], tabled in Parliament on 10 September 2002 and referred
     to it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management of ESETA for the  unqualified
         audit opinion expressed by the  Auditor-General,  and  trusts  that
         future audit opinions will be equally unqualified.


     2.     Emphasis of Matter


         The Committee notes that under "Emphasis of Matter",  the  Auditor-
         General  has  raised  one  issue,  on  which  the  Committee  makes
         comments in paragraph 4 below.


     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee  notes  that  ESETA's  Annual  Report  and  Financial
         Statements were tabled in Parliament on 10 September 2002.


         This late tabling constitutes non-compliance with section  65(1)(a)
         of the Public Finance Management Act.


     4.     Internal audit


         The Committee notes that no internal  audit  was  conducted  during
         the year under review. This is contrary to section 51(1)(a)(ii)  of
         the Public Finance Management Act.


         The  Committee,  however,  notes  that  the  internal  auditor  was
         officially appointed only towards the end of  the  financial  year,
         and therefore was not in position to conduct an internal audit.


     5.     Conclusion


         Having  considered  issues  of  special  concern,  addressed  under
         "Emphasis of  Matter",  and  as  the  report  is  unqualified,  the
         Committee is of the view that a hearing on ESETA for the  financial
         under review is unnecessary.


     Report to be considered.

13.   Thirteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated
     25 February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Report
     of the Auditor-General  on  the  Financial  Statements  of  the  Media,
     Advertising, Publishing, Printing and Packaging  Sector  Education  and
     Training Authority [MAPPP-SETA] for the year ended 31  March  2002  [RP
     105-02], tabled in Parliament on 30 August 2002  and  referred  to  it,
     reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee  notes  with  concern  the  qualified  audit  opinion
         expressed  by  the  Auditor-General.  The  Committee  trusts   that
         management will pay the necessary attention to those  issues  which
         resulted in the qualified opinion, so that  future  audit  opinions
         will be unqualified. The Committee comments  on  these  matters  in
         paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 below.


     2.     Emphasis of Matter


         The Committee notes that under "Emphasis of  Matter"  the  Auditor-
         General  has  raised  several  issues,  in  respect  of  which  the
         Committee makes comments and recommendations in paragraphs 7 and  8
         below.
     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee commends the management of MAPPP-SETA  for  timeously
         tabling the Annual Report and  the  Financial  Statements,  thereby
         complying with section 65(1)(a) of the  Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     4.     Levy income


         Although the completeness of levy income could  not  be  confirmed,
         the Committee notes that the South  African  Revenue  Services  did
         not submit substantiating evidence and detail  in  respect  of  the
         levies transferred to MAPPP-SETA.


     5.     Value-added tax


         The Committee notes that no proof  could  be  submitted  for  audit
         purposes that reconciliations had been performed  between  the  VAT
         2001 returns and the VAT control account.
     6.     Post-retirement medical aid benefits


         In  terms  of  generally  accepted  accounting  practice,   certain
         disclosures  are  necessary   for   post-retirement   medical   aid
         benefits. The Committee notes that these disclosures have not  been
         complied with in MAPPP-SETA's financial  statements  for  the  year
         under review.


         However,  the  Committee  notes,  and   welcomes,   the   actuarial
         valuation of the employer's  ability  in  respect  of  health  care
         benefits for retirees, that was performed by actuarial  consultants
         for the previous and financial year under review.


     7.     Receipting


         The  Committee  notes  with  concern  that  the  audit   procedures
         regarding the accuracy and completeness  of  income  could  not  be
         carried out satisfactorily.


         The Committee welcomes the indication by  management  that  receipt
         detail will be recorded in the relevant register  to  confirm  that
         payments received were accurate and complete.


         The Committee recommends that the  Auditor-General  report  thereon
         in his next Report.


     8.     Internal control


         The  Committee  notes  with  concern   that   there   are   certain
         shortcomings in MAPPP-SETA's internal control measures.


         The Committee welcomes management's assurance  that  the  necessary
         steps will be taken to place  the  relevant  checking  and  control
         measures on a sound footing.


         The Committee recommends that the  Auditor-General  report  thereon
         in his next Report on MAPPP-SETA.


     9.     Conclusion


         Despite the qualified opinion  expressed  by  the  Auditor-General,
         the Committee, having considered  the  various  issues  of  concern
         raised by the Auditor-General, recommends that no hearing  be  held
         on MAPPP-SETA for the financial year under review.


     Report to be considered.

14.   Fourteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts,  dated
     25 February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Annual
     Report, including the Report of the Auditor-General  on  the  Financial
     Statements, of the Compensation Fund for the  year  ended  28  February
     2002 [RP 118-02], tabled in Parliament on 6 August 2003 and referred to
     it, reports as follows:


     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee notes the reasons for  the  qualified  audit  opinion
         expressed by the Auditor-General. It trusts  that  management  will
         pay  particular  attention  to  the  aspects  which  led   to   the
         qualification and will address the concerns raised, with a view  to
         avoiding such negative audit  opinions  in  future.  The  Committee
         deals with these in paragraphs 4 and 5 below.


     2.     Emphasis of Matter


         The Committee notes that  the  Auditor-General  has  cited  several
         issues  under  "Emphasis  of  Matter",  which   need   management's
         attention. The Committee comments on these issues in paragraphs  6,
         7 and 8 below.


     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee commends the management of the Compensation Fund  for
         having timeously tabled its Annual Report  in  Parliament,  thereby
         complying with section 65(1)(a) of the  Public  Finance  Management
         Act.


     4.     Disallowances


         The  Committee  notes  with  grave   concern   that   disallowances
         consisting of overpayments and duplicate  payments  in  respect  of
         medical,  compensation  and  pensions  payments  had  increased  by
         nearly 23% to more than R6,78 million,  compared  to  the  previous
         year.


         The Committee strongly recommends that, as a  matter  of  priority,
         management put in place effective control measures to prevent  such
         payments, and that it submit to Parliament, by  30  April  2003,  a
         report  indicating  the  nature  of  those   controls   and   their
         effectiveness.


     5.     Property plant and equipment


         The Committee notes that  there  was  a  net  difference  of  R1,01
         million between the general ledger and the  fixed  assets  register
         as at 28 February 2002, compared to the R1,24 million the  previous
         year.


         The  Committee  notes  the  Auditor-General's  assurance  that  the
         difference had been identified, and welcomes  his  indication  that
         it will be corrected in the following financial year.


     6.     Financial management structure of fund


         The Committee notes that, in terms  of  the  relevant  legislation,
         the Director-General of Labour accepted the responsibility  as  the
         accounting authority of the Compensation Fund.


         The Committee notes the Auditor-General's recommendation that,  due
         to several practical difficulties being experienced, the  Director-
         General  should  consider  obtaining  the  required  approval   for
         appointment of the  Compensation  Commissioner  as  the  accounting
         authority.


     7.     Information system environment


         The Committee notes with grave concern that:


         *  Control weaknesses still exist in the control environment  as  a
           whole.


         *   The  most  significant  control  weakness  is  that  a   formal
           documented disaster recovery plan has still not  been  developed
           and implemented.


         *  There is no assurance that  it  would  be  possible  to  recover
           business activities in the event of a disaster.


         The Committee therefore recommends that Auditor-General assess  the
         adequacy of corrective action taken to rectify  the  weaknesses  in
         the information system environment and report thereon in  his  next
         Report.


     8.     Control over fixed assets


         The Committee is concerned that:


         *  Physical control over fixed assets is not effective.


         *  The disposal of assets were not recorded in the asset register.


         *  The incorrect classification of fixed  assets  has  resulted  in
           the understatement of depreciation.


         The Committee recommends that Auditor-General, during  the  2002-03
         audit, assess the  effectiveness/adequacy  of  corrective  measures
         with regard to control over fixed assets and report thereon in  his
         next Report.
     9.     Conclusion


         Having considered the  reasons  for  the  qualified  audit  opinion
         expressed by the Auditor-General, and despite having noted  various
         issues of concern which will  be  reported  on,  the  Committee  is
         nevertheless of the view that a hearing on  the  Compensation  Fund
         for the financial year under review is not necessary.


     Report to be considered.

15.   Fifteenth Report of the Standing Committee on Public  Accounts,  dated
    25 February 2003:


     The Standing Committee on Public Accounts, having considered the Annual
     Report, including the Report of the Auditor-General  on  the  Financial
     Statements, of the Construction Sector Education and Training Authority
     [CETA] for the  year  ended  31  March  2002  [RP  136-02],  tabled  in
     Parliament on 30 August 2002 and referred to it, reports as follows:
     1.     Audit opinion


         The Committee commends the management  for  the  unqualified  audit
         opinion expressed by the Auditor-General, and  trusts  that  future
         audit opinions will be equally unqualified.


     2.     Emphasis of Matter


         The Committee notes that  the  Auditor-General  has  cited  various
         issues under "Emphasis of Matter" which need the  urgent  attention
         of  management.  The  Committee  comments  on   these   issues   in
         paragraphs 4 to 10 below.


     3.     Tabling of Annual Report


         The Committee commends the management of CETA for having  timeously
         tabled its Annual Report  in  Parliament,  thereby  complying  with
         section 65(1)(a) of the Public Finance Management Act.


     4.     Recovery of levy payable by employers


         The Committee notes that:


         *  Any levy which  remains  unpaid  on  the  last  day  of  payment
           thereof,  may  be  recovered  by   instituting   action   in   a
           magistrate's court.


         *  CETA or its collecting agents  must  obtain  approval  from  the
           Minister of Labour to follow up the outstanding levies, but that
           such approval has not been received.


         *  CETA cannot  collect  current  levies,  except  in  terms  of  a
           determination issued by the Minister.


         The Committee is  concerned  that  there  are  a  large  number  of
         outstanding levies which have not been followed  up  by  CETA,  and
         that this could result in losses  to  CETA  if  no  effective  debt
         recovery procedures are in place.
         The Committee recommends that this matter be  accorded  the  urgent
         attention it deserves, and welcomes the indication that  additional
         information  will  be  compiled  by  the  staff  of   CETA,   after
         consultation with the Auditor-General's  Office,  for  presentation
         to Parliament.


     5.     Accumulated surplus funds


         The Committee notes that:


         *  Surplus funds  from  operations  for  the  period  under  review
           exceeded R4,5 million.


         *  Written approval should be obtained from  National  Treasury  to
           retain the said surplus funds.


         *  Application for the above  has  been  made,  but  CETA  has  not
           received a response yet.


         The Committee recommends that CETA  indicate  to  it  whether  they
         have received approval from National  Treasury,  and  if  not,  why
         not.


     6.     Transfer of assets and liabilities


         The Committee notes  with  concern  that  the  transfer  of  assets
         amounting to more than R5,8 million and liabilities  in  excess  of
         R4,2 million, belonging to  the  now  abolished  Building  Industry
         Training Board (BITB) and the  Building  Industry  Training  Scheme
         (BITS), has not been finalised.


         As  this  matter  increases  managerial  and  financial  risk,  the
         Committee recommends that the matter be finalised as  a  matter  of
         urgency and that the Auditor-General report  thereon  in  his  next
         report.


     7.     VAT liability


         The Committee notes that:
         *  An amount in excess of R1,38 million under  current  liabilities
           in the balance sheet represented grant  levies  when  they  were
           committed to projects.


         *  There is uncertainty on whether VAT  should  be  paid  when  the
           liability is raised or when project claims are paid.


         *  As a result of this  uncertainty,  the  timely  payment  of  VAT
           could not be properly managed.


         *  A response from SARS  to  clarify  the  matter  is  still  being
           awaited.


         The Committee recommends that  management  resolve  all  the  above
         issues raised by the Auditor-General, and that the  Auditor-General
         report thereon in his next report.


     8.     Risk assessment


         The Committee notes with concern that CETA did not conduct  a  full
         risk assessment for the year under review, as required by the  PFMA
         and the Treasury Regulations of 2001.


         The Committee notes that this  non-compliance  impacted  negatively
         on the completion of a fraud prevention plan.


         Having noted that the outsourced internal audit function had  begun
         facilitating a  risk  assessment  subsequent  to  the  end  of  the
         financial year, the Committee recommends that  the  Auditor-General
         report thereon in his next report on CETA.


     9.     Audit Committee


         The Committee notes that the composition  and  functioning  of  the
         Audit Committee was in accordance with the PFMA, but  that  it  was
         not fully operational for the year under review,  as  it  was  only
         established during the year.
         The Committee recommends that the  Auditor-General  report  thereon
         in his next report.


     10.    Internal audit


         The Committee notes that the internal audit function will  only  be
         fully operational  during  the  next  financial  year,  as  it  was
         established during the year under review.


         The Committee recommends that the  Auditor-General  report  thereon
         in his next report.


     11.    Conclusion


         Having  noted  that  some  issues  of  special  concern  are  being
         addressed, and as the report is unqualified, the  Committee  is  of
         the view that a hearing on CETA for the year under  review  is  not
         necessary.


     Report to be considered.
