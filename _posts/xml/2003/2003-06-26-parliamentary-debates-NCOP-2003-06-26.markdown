                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter,  ek  gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  by  die
volgende sitting sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad duidelik kennis neem dat die Nuwe NP onderneem om  voort  te
  gaan om die -


  (1) blatante onwaarheid en onmoontlikheid  van  die  DA  as  alternatiewe
       Regering te ontbloot; en


  (2) plakkaat, pamflet en  mediaveldtogte  oor  veiligheidsaangeleenthede,
       sonder enige implementeringsbevoegdheid, te ontbloot  as  foefies  om
       die emosies van kiesers uit te buit vir politieke oorlewing.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I give notice that I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council clearly notes  the  NNP's  undertaking  to  continue  to
  expose the -


  (1) blatant untruth and impossibility of the  DA  being  the  alternative
       government; and


  (2) poster, pamphlet and media campaigns on safety matters,  without  any
       powers of implementation, as gimmicks to exploit the emotions of  the
       electorate for political survival.]

                    PROTEAS' QUEST FOR CRICKET REDEMPTION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Proteas, under  new  Captain  Graeme  Smith,  commence
       their quest for cricket  redemption  when  they  play  a  rejuvenated
       England under their new captain Michael Vaughan on  Saturday  at  the
       famous Oval; and


  (2) wishes the South African team  every  success  in  their  attempt  to
       regain  some  semblance  of  cricket  authority  after  their  woeful
       performances at the Cricket World Cup.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             CURRENT DEBT CRISIS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr K D S DURR: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern -


       (a)  the spiralling debt trap that people are getting caught in;


       (b)  that unemployment is a critical  factor  causing  people  to  be
           lured into borrowing practices from which they  have  difficulty
           to escape;


       (c)  that  gambling  is  fundamentally  a  huge  contributor  to  the
           increase in debt and poverty;
       (d)  that the current debt crisis  is  close  to  becoming  a  social
           disaster, which needs serious  intervention  measures,  such  as
           education and the imposition of severe penalties  on  those  who
           recklessly encourage people  at  risk  to  borrow  beyond  their
           means; and


       (e)  that the micro-lenders primarily create the  easiest  access  to
           money, and  then  by  the  deduction  of  huge  amounts  through
           subsequent garnishee orders increase the  debt-related  problems
           of our nation;


  (2) is therefore pleased that Parliament is to take steps to address this
       issue; and


  (3) calls on the Government to investigate in particular the  impact  and
       contribution of the micro-lending and gambling industries on  poverty
       and the debt trap.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.
                  KE MOJA ANTIDRUG ABUSE CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms L JACOBUS: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) supports and endorses the Ke Moja anti-drug  abuse  public  awareness
       campaign that was launched earlier today, 26 June 2003, in  which  we
       will be joining hands with all stakeholders within  the  country  and
       internationally in saying, "No thanks, I am fine. I do not want to do
       drugs.";


  (2) calls on all members to heed the call on  International  Day  Against
       Drug Abuse,  and  to  seize  the  opportunity  to  persevere  in  our
       government's   endeavours   through   policies,    legislation    and
       intervention strategies to prevent and  treat  the  problem  of  drug
       dependency;


  (3) encourages members to support the work of all stakeholders, including
       government entities such as the  Central  Drug  Authority,  who  work
       tirelessly, despite the increases in  gangsterism  and  illicit  drug
       trafficking, to prevent and treat drug dependency;


  (4) supports a campaign to make parents, teachers and  communities  aware
       that our children attending school  are  increasingly  becoming  soft
       targets for illicit drug distribution and abuse; and


  (5) congratulates the Minister of Social Development on his initiative in
       launching such a campaign.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              SA GOVERNMENT'S EXCEPTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF ECONOMY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes once more, benefits attributed to the strength of the rand  and
       lower oil prices, which pushed the Producer Price Index to 1.1%;


  (2) further notes that a weaker rand was attributed by some economists to
       Government's policies;


  (3) believes that a lower Producer Price Index is  a  good  step  in  the
       right direction and will benefit ordinary citizens;


  (4) further believes that  this  news  proves  that  our  Government  has
       exceptional policies despite what other people previously  wanted  us
       to believe; and


  (5) therefore applauds the South African Government as a  collective  for
       its exceptional management of the economy.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                  LANGUAGES

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -

       (a)  die Amerikaanse ambassade vir hul personeel taalkursusse aanbied
           om hulle voor te berei vir die land waarheen hulle gaan;


       (b)  Mary Grace McGeehan, eerste sekretaris van politieke sake in die
           Amerikaanse ambassade in Kaapstad, die geleentheid aangegryp het
           om Afrikaans te bemeester; en


       (c)  daar vandag, 26 Junie 2003, van haar afskeid geneem is, maar ook
           weet dat die inheemse Suid-Afrikaanse taal 'n brugbouer sal  bly
           tussen Suid-Afrika en waar sy ook al mag heen gaan; en


  (2) alle ambassades versoek om ondersoek in te stel na  die  moontlikheid
       om Afrikaans en die ander inheemse Suid-Afrikaanse tale aan  te  bied
       vir personeel wat in Suid-Afrika diens moet doen.

[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  the American embassy offers language courses for their personnel
           to prepare them for the country to which they are going;


       (b)  Mary Grace McGeehan, first secretary of political affairs in the
           American embassy in Cape Town, seized the opportunity to  master
           Afrikaans; and


       (c)  today, 26 June 2003, she was bidden  farewell,  but  also  knows
           that the indigenous South African language will remain a builder
           of bridges between South Africa and whichever country she may be
           going to; and


  (2) requests all embassies to investigate  the  possibility  of  offering
       Afrikaans  and  the  other  indigenous  South  African  languages  to
       personnel who have to serve in South Africa.

[Applause.]]

                    FULL-SCALE GANG WAR FEARED IN DURBAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the Durban police are bracing themselves for a  full-scale
       gang war on the city's streets  after  the  shooting  of  an  alleged
       gangland enforcer outside a local nightclub;


  (2) further notes that heightening fears of all-out warfare is  the  fact
       that Cape Town  and  Johannesburg  gangs  are  known  to  be  sending
       enforcers to Durban to protect their associates;


  (3) believes that the looming turf war  is  an  attempt  to  control  the
       lucrative drug trade in the city; and


  (4) therefore  urges  all  the  police  officers  in  Durban  to  protect
       themselves.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

               CELEBRATION OF 48TH BIRTHDAY OF FREEDOM CHARTER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  it is the celebration  of  the  48th  birthday  of  the  Freedom
           Charter, which was ratified in Kliptown on 26 June;


       (b)  it is the foundation of our new  South  Africa  and  our  world-
           acclaimed Constitution of South Africa;


       (c)  we recollect that both  these  documents  were  not  drafted  by
           experts but are the true wishes  of  all  the  people  of  South
           Africa of all backgrounds;


       (d)  we remember that we are here through the blood, sweat, tears and
           deaths of many people, young and old,  who  went  through  these
           agonies so that we may live; and


       (e)  we take pride that we, the indigenous Africans who suffered  and
           continue to suffer, yet never stood for "an eye for an eye", but
           instead we "turned enemies into friends" and we still strive  to
           share our land and our resources with all people; and


  (2) reiterates its commitment to the last words in the  Freedom  Charter,
       which state thus:


       These freedoms we will fight for,
       Side by side,
       Throughout our lives,
       Until we have won our liberty.

[Applause.]

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 13 - Statistics SA:

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Deputy Chairperson, hon  members,  in  opening  the
Budget Vote on Statistics SA, I'm reminded that  as  a  nation  we  have  an
immense appetite for information, because this information tells us so  many
things about ourselves and about society in general. People need to  measure
all kinds of things.

Die Burger this morning discusses something that  happened  in  one  of  the
military bases. It says that the moral  discipline  in  the  camp  could  be
measured by the speed with which a box of condoms was  emptied.  [Laughter.]
People need to measure all kinds of things, but I don't think that  that  is
quite what we are going to talk about today.

Statistics SA must rise to the challenge to ensure that we  have  an  agency
that is legitimate, that has respect and credibility, and that  is  seen  to
produce accurate, reliable and timely statistics. This is a  challenge  that
Statistics SA  takes  very  seriously  through  hard  work  and  dedication.
However, we know that a number of difficulties and challenges remain.

I should, in introducing the Vote,  advise  members  here  that  unlike  the
other departments  that  report  to  me  -  National  Treasury  and  Sars  -
Statistics  SA  has  a  special  statute  which  creates   an   arm's-length
relationship. This is so that what they do - the series that they  undertake
and all of the detail - is managed  independently  of  Government.  Whenever
there's a release, like the PPA release this week, I receive it at the  same
time as all other users.
Normally Dr Hirschowitz, who's in the box here,  will  send  me  an  SMS  to
advise me of what the new release is. I have no prior sighting. Stats SA  is
fully compliant with the standard data dissemination service and system,  as
it obtains in the IMF. I do, however, have a very keen  interest  because  I
am  accountable,  at  the  end  of  the  day,  for  the  management  of  the
organisation. So it is in this context that I rise to address this House.

Also, when an issue arises that in any way casts doubt  on  the  quality  of
the statistics, we must  move  speedily.  For  instance,  when  we  had  the
difficulty in relation to CPIX, we moved very swiftly  to  ensure  that  the
Statistics Council, which is a body created by the same statute as a  filter
for the detail, would, in fact, undertake a review and be able  to  talk  to
South Africans about the changes that we want in respect of Stats  SA  going
forward. In terms of the Statistics Act, the Stats  Council,  in  fact,  has
the responsibility of being the custodians of statistics in South Africa.

Of course, whenever there's a mistake, it is a matter of  concern,  although
I should say that the term  ``accurate  statistics''  remains  an  oxymoron.
It's the best estimates in any circumstance ever. Don't look like that,  hon
Durr. Accurate statistics don't exist. What the statistics  agency  must  do
is to minimise the margin of error, which is normal across the  world.  This
is so that if you have a release that is outside  the  norms  and  standards
you set for yourselves - and those  have  to  be  the  highest  -  then,  of
course, it is cause for concern.

The CPIX debacle of a few weeks ago is still very fresh in  our  minds,  but
there are other agencies that have committed similar or worse  errors.  What
is important is not that the error occurred, but how you deal with it  going
forward. I'd like to submit to this House for consideration and debate  that
the speed with which we moved and the involvement of the Statistics  Council
suggest that we take these matters sufficiently seriously. We want Stats  SA
to be transparent; we want its outputs to be seen  as  having  a  very  high
level of legitimacy, because we need accurate data, or as close  thereto  as
possible, to ensure that we can have informed decision-making.

An agency like Stats SA requires stability.  I  have  spoken  to  people  in
statistics agencies around the world. They tend not  to  be  revolutionaries
in big T-shirts of Che Guevara and so on, like the hon  Jacobus.  They  tend
to be quiet, numbers people. They work in  stable  organisations.  They  are
very focused on outputs.

However, in the context of South Africa, this  is  a  battle  which  we  are
still very much engaged in, because  what  we  had  in  1995  or  1994  come
democracy was not an organisation with a  sound  basis  for  statistics.  It
was, in  fact,  an  organisation  in  chronic  turmoil:  unco-ordinated  and
untimely economic statistical series and a complete absence of attention  to
social issues, such as poverty and the measurement of access to services.

It may come as a complete surprise - and, in fact, often when we share  this
information with outsiders, it is surprising - that on 8 July this  year  we
will be releasing the results of only the second full census  undertaken  in
this country. Prior to that, the last  census  in  1991,  the  1991  census,
measured primarily white areas - they  knocked  on  doors  and  did  a  full
census. The rest, black  areas  in  South  Africa,  were  shot  from  aerial
photographs, and then of  course  there  were  the  TBVC  states  and  self-
governing territories.

If that is the base of your information, you clearly are not  interested  in
knowing what the social conditions are that people live under.  So  changing
that requires a monumental effort. I think our focus must be on  the  extent
of that effort to  ensure,  as  decision-makers  all,  we  have  a  base  of
information that is reliable.

Each one of us,  regardless  of  the  party  we  represent  here,  has  been
deployed to work in a constituency. Each one of us, therefore - if we  don't
have the capacity to know the data of all of South Africa -  needs  to  know
what is happening within our constituency, needs to know what  changes  have
taken place in the past nine-and-a-half years, and needs to be  able  to  be
accountable to the constituency that one serves.

In that regard, the  position  of  members  of  Parliament  in  relation  to
statistics  is  exceedingly  important.  If  those   stats   are   therefore
incorrect, they become unusable and they diminish  the  ability  of  elected
representatives to serve and for democracy to be the winner at  the  end  of
the day. So I'm glad, also, that the NCOP  chose  to  take  this  debate  on
Stats SA because it is so fundamentally important.

In order to  produce  those  outputs,  we  have  to  focus  on  building  an
organisation that is well equipped with  people  and  systems.  We  have  to
train and retrain staff. We have to ensure at Stats SA  that  the  decisions
by the Statistician-General, Mr Lehohla, here, because  the  Act  gives  him
the responsibility of prioritising the series undertaken by Stats  SA  -  is
in full accordance with  the  needs  of  South  Africa,  and  not  something
fanciful, inherited or copied from elsewhere. Our needs in South Africa  are
developmental in every sense of the word, and we must ensure  that  we  have
accurate information that deals with those kinds of issues.

Building an organisation that is properly equipped  with  human  capital  is
proving to be the hardest  part.  For  the  past  two  years  we  have  been
searching for individuals to head up both  economic  stats  and  informatics
within Stats SA. For the past two years,  we  have  not  found  people  like
that.

There is one university in South Africa, namely Wits, that teaches a  course
on official statistics and that course was introduced at  the  beginning  of
2002. This neglect - yes, let's be good about it: it's a benign  neglect  in
academia about the value of statistics - does not serve democracy  well.  It
is something we must take up and take up very seriously to  ensure  that  we
have a deep reservoir of people  that  we  can  draw  on  to  populate  this
organisation  and  ensure  that  individuals  like  ourselves,  members   of
Parliament, members of provincial legislatures  and  councillors,  have  the
information that allows us to improve on  the  quality  of  the  service  we
render.

We have partnerships; wonderful partnerships with a whole range of the  best
institutions in the world.  Statistics  Canada,  the  Australian  Bureau  of
Statistics and Statistics Sweden are three of the  partners  from  which  we
learn and with which we share. We  also  have  relationships  with  Makerere
University in Uganda where a number of our people have to go for training  -
undergraduate and postgraduate. In fact, we have a few  PhD  students  there
at the moment. In addition, we have a relationship with  the  University  of
Pittsburgh ... which one? Oh, it is with the University of  Pennsylvania.  I
keep forgetting that one.

We  have  these  relationships  because  Stats  SA,  amongst  our   domestic
responsibilities, also has to be active in developing  accurate  information
and a demographic base especially on the African continent.  We  are  active
in this regard with the University of Pennsylvania.

Our relationships with  these  other  agencies  put  us  in  a  position  of
learning. Last night, after the debates in this House, I was  privileged  to
meet the recently retired head of Statistics Canada, who  is  visiting  with
Stats SA and who will  help  us.  He  was  explaining  to  me  the  kind  of
organisation that Stats Canada has become. It is an organisation with a  95-
year history. Stats Canada is an organisation which, until now, has  had  11
heads of the organisation. They know the history of the  organisation.  They
know its ups and downs. They know when the changes have happened.

Stats Canada today does not take  people  with  junior  degrees.  They  want
master's graduates. Then they can be selective and choose  the  people  with
the As, because the organisation has developed a reputation that is  strong,
that makes it an employer of choice, and so they can be selective.

At this stage of the game in South Africa, we battle  to  find  people  with
statistical literacy to employ so that we  can  train  them  once  they  are
inside the organisation. Canada, as hon members may be aware, has  about  30
million people. Stats Canada employs 5 000 people;  permanent  people.  Then
there are people who are taken in on contract to do particular  surveys,  or
to do a big project like a census.

The number of South Africans there are we will keep  secret  until  8  July,
when Stats SA hands over Census 2001 to the President. But  for  the  number
of us that there are, Stats SA employs a contingent of 804 people.  That  is
the comparison. If you look at Stats Canada, for every  three  professionals
there is one administrative staff member. Amongst our 804 members  of  staff
you almost, in fact, have the inverse position.

Now this is not for want of trying. It isn't even for want  of  money.  What
we need in  South  Africa  is  a  pool  of  people  who  can  populate  this
organisation  to  ensure  that  we,  as   decision-makers,   have   accurate
statistics because people are properly mobilised and they are available.  So
the first challenge for us is one of availability.

Sitting in the box are a number of the senior management of  Stats  SA.  The
statistician-general, his two deputies, and a number  of  other  members  of
senior management are here. Whilst we have learnt from  other  organisations
elsewhere in the world, often the individuals who are  sitting  in  the  box
are having to do other things.

In the middle of the processing of the census, Dr Hirschowitz, whose job  is
quality control and who is involved in that, calls me on  a  Sunday  morning
because there is big storm in Pretoria and the roof  is  leaking.  Now  what
the statistician has to do with the  leaking  roof  describes  part  of  the
difficulty. [Laughter.] So you need to retool this organisation  and  ensure
that you have a focus, and a focus on the outputs.

But in order to do that you need to be able to draw on a lot more  people  -
many, many more South Africans. In  truth,  owing  to  the  dirth  of  South
African talent available, I would not be incorrect in  saying  that  if  you
come to Stats SA you will find a truly AU organisation,  because  we  employ
Africans from virtually every  country  on  the  continent.  These  are  the
offsets. This the challenge. I'm not rising to make excuses for anything.

Members of the select committee would  have  visited  Stats  SA  on  various
occasions. Members should engage with this. I think that  other  members  of
the NCOP must come to  understand  because  this  is  the  enormity  of  the
challenge.

However, that notwithstanding, Stats SA produces 118 different data  series.
Amongst these, the biggest, of course, is the population  census  which,  by
statute, is conducted  every  five  years.  The  other  series  include  the
national accounts, such as the gross domestic product; price data; the  CPI;
the PPI and its various derivatives; quarterly  surveys  of  employment  and
earnings; the labour force surveys; income and expenditure surveys;  poverty
statistics; and one of the most advanced geographic information systems.

When hon members return to Parliament  after  the  recess  and  constituency
period, we will avail some staff to demonstrate to members the value of  the
geographic information system: how you can zero in on your constituency  and
understand what exists there. This is because in the design of Census  2001,
South Africa was broken up into what we call ``enumerator  areas'',  roughly
130 houses each. In terms of those 130  houses  we  are  able  to  map  that
information. After 8 July some of the information will be available  on  the
Internet. Members who are familiar with the Web can access that  information
and begin to understand. To get there actually requires a heck of a  lot  of
hard work.

In Census 2001, 10,3 million households were visited, and in every case  the
questionnaire was 12 pages long. I think that if you total that,  you  begin
to understand the magnitude of the challenge.

Then, once you have the information you  have  to  process  it.  And  having
processed it, you need to ensure that the information  is  correct,  because
sometimes funny things happen. You find three year olds with  PhDs,  and  so
on. You have to sort out those kinds of things. All of that  have  now  been
checked and will be available for consumption by South  Africa  on  8  July.
Whilst that is happening, there must be regular issues of CPI and  PPI,  and
household surveys of this or that kind, as well as  certain  checks  in  the
national accounts, all of which Statistics SA has  to  do  on  a  continuous
basis.

So, once this information is handed to the President on 8 July, and we  know
that the information is as accurate as can be in the  circumstances,  a  new
battle begins, one which will transform the NCOP, now  a  place  of  enomous
calm, into a centre of turmoil. Because part of what we will need to  do  is
to use the results of Census 2001  to  redesign  the  formula  by  which  we
allocate resources to provinces. So, the hon members form the  Eastern  Cape
are going to say that Gauteng told lies, and Gauteng is going  to  say  that
it wasn't them, but that it was the Western Cape.  They  are  going  to  say
that Gauteng is mistaken and that they  should  go  to  Mpumalanga,  because
those people should be recounted there are not as many  as  they  say  there
are.

These are going to be the issues that will  dominate  the  redesign  of  the
formula as we go forward, but it is going to be an important process  to  go
through. So, the quality of the information we  have  at  our  disposal  for
Budget-making  and  for  equitable  share  distribution  is  going   to   be
exceedingly important. It is important, because statistics  and  census,  in
particular, find a place in the way in which we live out our  constitutional
mandate, and the way in which we deliver democracy in South Africa.

I said earlier that this census is  the  second  census.  Now  we  have  two
censuses undertaken in South Africa, five years apart, but the  1996  Census
was the ``dawn of democracy'' census. The next  census  followed  two  years
after a period of intense policy-making. In 2001 there have already  been  a
number  of  years  of  policy  implementation  and  the  changes   must   be
measurable, and that is what we need to look for. We  must  ensure  that  we
can understand whether we are living up to the mandate, that contract  which
we have with people about a better life for all, that is the key element  to
be measured in the results of Census 2001.

The quality control is provided by  the  Statistics  Council.  I  asked  one
member of the Statistics Council yesterday, who has a  day  job,  she  is  a
professor at the university, how many hours she worked on Statistics  SA  in
2003. She said that it would be substantianlly more than 300  hours.  Now  I
do not think that we even pay  her  R300  for  that.  But  these  are  South
Africans who have given of  themselves  so  that  we  can  take  appropriate
decisions; so that we know that the quality of the information  from  Census
2001 will be sufficient for us to take informed decisions for the future.  I
think it is an enormous gift that we have in our ability to  draw  on  these
people.

We  met  the  Statistics  Council  yesterday,   we   have   interministerial
committee, and they have shared with us some of their observations,  without
going into the numbers. In two weeks' time, all South Africans and decision-
makers, legislators  in  particular,  will  be  armed  with  a  new  set  of
information. It will be available  in  a  variety  of  forms:  hard  copies,
copies available on the web and on cd-rom. It will be information that  will
be exceedingly important to our decision-making.

We would like to express our appreciation to the  Statistician-General,  the
management and the staff of Statistics SA,  and  also  to  all  those  other
people who were involved in the numeration  and  processing,  many  of  whom
worked on a contract basis. But that is a small part of the  work.  I  think
immediately after the census results, we would still have to debate a  whole
number of series: CPI, CPIX, PPI, and so on. Because  the  same  people  are
going to knock on the door  the  Reserve  Bank  and  say:  ``Governor,  with
inflation coming down'', as I heard in the notice of motion  earlier,  ``you
had better bring down interest rates, because we are  paying  too  much  for
mortage bonds.''

People expect reliable information so that they  can  take  decisions  about
themselves.  Employers  expect  reliable  information  for  the  negotiating
period and trade unions expect information so that  they  can  advise  their
members  of  negotiating  strategies.  Communities,  in   general,   require
accurate information so that they can take informed decisions, be  it  about
the budgets of local authorities, the way in which IDPs are drawn up,  or  a
myriad other things.

The information that Statistics SA produces  shapes  our  lives  in  a  very
great way. It is a hard battle. We know what the  shortcomings  are,  but  I
think we also owe a debt of gratitude to  those  who  worked  so  incredibly
hard, under difficult circumstances, to provide us with the  information  we
have at our disposal.

Ndiyabulela, Mhlalingaphambili. [Kwaqhwatywa.] [I  thank  you,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]]

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Thank you Deputy Chair, Minister of Finance and the  Deputy
Minister of Finance, members of the NCOP and the special delegates  who  are
present here today. It is interesting that when the figures were  withdrawn,
because  Statistics  SA  wanted  to  correct  certain  things,   they   made
headlines, and everybody was running behind it. Today the Business  Day  has
headlines about the lowest PPI figures in  30  years,  and  people  are  not
making noise about it. This was the point the Minister emphasised.

The importance of the Statistics SA Budget Vote  cannot  be  overemphasized.
In 12 days' time the results for Census 2001 will be formally released,  and
the President will receive  it,  as  the  Minister  said.  It  is  therefore
crucial that hon members take a keen interest in what is going to  come  out
of this product.

Amongst other reasons, census results are of importance  for  the  following
reasons: Firstly, the Minister talked about reviewing the formula  and  what
role the new or proper information play in  reviewing  the  equitable  share
formula, as suggested by the Treasury and the FFC. I briefed  members  about
this a few  weeks  ago.  Secondly,  in  order  to  make  appropriate  policy
intervention, you need proper information, and  I  do  believe  that  census
results will assist us in this regard.

Thirdly, it will give  us  an  indication  of  the  total  number  of  South
Africans in our country, men, women and children. We will also  be  able  to
measure to what extent we have managed to improve and change the  people  in
South Africa's lives for  the  better.  I  think  that  for  these  reasons,
amongst others, as I have stated, we should be  taking  the  census  results
seriously.

In  briefing  the  members  of  the  NCOP  on  11   June   about   the   FFC
recommendations for 2004-05, it became clear that there was a need  for  new
information regarding the future. Therefore, the points I  have  alluded  to
earlier try to relate to the point that for us to  be  able  to  review  the
formula, to know, for  instance,  about  the  allocation  to  education  and
health, we need to have new  information  in  data  which  will  enable  the
policy-makers to make those changes.

On 15 June, when President Mbeki visited Mpumalanga, he raised the issue  of
the lack of properly qualified staticians in our country.  It  is  important
that we support initiatives taken by Statistics SA  to  train  statisticians
in different institutions in our country and elsewhere on the continent,  as
has been provided for in the previous Budget Vote. The Minister  has  talked
about that. However, it is important to emphasise that,  as  a  country,  we
need  to  develop  infrastructure  and  programmes  to  teach  people  about
official statistics, because people who have been trained at university  are
not trained regarding offical statistics. As a country and  nation  we  need
to try and invest with regard to this area.  We  must  continue  to  support
these efforts, but continue to  encourage  learners,  to  be  interested  in
subjects like maths and science. Because out of that you  can  then  produce
statisticians of different kinds.

I am concerned  about  the  fact  that  in  the  recent  past  some  of  the
newspapers have highlighted problems of management in  the  organisation.  I
am also particularly concerned about the fact that instead  of  having  five
DDGs for the statistics department, they only have two. I think that  it  is
very important for the statisticians to  ensure  that  these  vacancies  are
filled, if they are budgeted for. We cannot afford to have an  organisation,
as important as this one, which does not operate at full capacity.

We understand the problem of the lack of skills, but I  think  every  effort
must be made to make sure that we get properly qualified citizens,  even  if
it means that we have to go offshore to get to those people. I am sure  that
we do have such people who can assist us somewhere on the continent.

I would like to talk about  matters  relating  to  other  vital  statistics.
Amongst others statistics that Statistics SA is producing, is  the  producer
price index, PPI; the consumer price index,  CPI;  and  the  gross  domestic
product, GDP. Statistics  about  the  gross  domestic  product  help  us  to
measure the level of growth in our economy from time to time to be  able  to
come to proper conclusions on whether the economy is growing or not.
Secondly, the producer price  index  assists  us  to  measure  the  cost  of
producing goods at shop floor level. As I said, the PPI figures, which  were
released yesterday, give a clear indication that there is a downward  trend.
The consumer price index helps us to measure the cost of  consumption,  that
is the price that you and I pay when we buy our groceries at  the  different
shops, like Pick 'n Pay, etc.

In  measuring  inflation,  we  use  CPI  minus  mortage  bonds.  So,   these
statistics are very vital for institutions like the  South  African  Reserve
Bank for  purposes  of  informing  monetary  policy  decisions.  The  recent
activities in this regard must be viewed in proper context.

I also want to show that this is not unique to South  Africa  by  reflecting
experiences of other countries where such mistakes have occurred. I quote:


  Measuring inflation and related economic statistics  incorrectly  may  be
  undermining our economy's prospects for growth. Simple measurement errors
  could have genuine effects on the fortunes of families and businesses  in
  every constituency throughout the country. As a result of  those  errors,
  interest  rates  could  be  too  high,  the   investment   decisions   of
  international  capital  might  be  biased  and  jobs  might   have   been
  unnecessarily lost.

This may sound like a recent debate about Statistics SA's  recent  revisions
of the consumer price index. But in  fact  it  is  a  quote  from  a  United
Kingdom parliamentary debate on 17 November 2000. The quote is from the  hon
member Mr Edward Davey's speech. He is responding to concerns about  British
consumer price index statistics.

Errors in the measurement  of  statistics  are  also  not  unique  to  South
Africa, or  even  developing  countries,  as  the  argument  by  the  UK  MP
illustrates.  The  World  Bank  states:  ``Measurement  errors  affect   the
reliability of all economics statistics''. In fact, in 1996  an  independent
commission appointed by the United States Congress reported that  government
overstated inflation  rates  by  1,1%  points,  costing  the  US  government
billions of dollars in inflated social security and other payments.

The important point here is that  mistakes  do  not  only  happen  in  South
Africa, they happen in the States, the  UK  and  all  other  countries.  The
important point is that mistakes are recognised, brought to  the  light  and
corrected in a fair and transparent manner.  This  is  a  sign  of  a  well-
functioning democracy, like in South Africa.

Statistics  SA  is  committed  to  an  ongoing  process  of  transformation.
Economists  around  the  country  applaud  this  transparency  and  delivery
orientation of the new statistics in South Africa. Yes,  we  recognise  that
mistakes happen, but we learn from them.  We  correct  them  and  we  emerge
stronger from these processes.

I would like to remind members of this House and the public  at  large  that
Statistics SA is a new organisation which must be supported at every  level.
In conclusion, I would like to make a call to all provinces to take  a  keen
interest on issues relating to Statistics  SA,  in  particular  through  the
Statistics Council, because provinces have representatives  in  the  council
which directly represent provincial interests.

I also want to convey my sincere thanks  to  the  Statistician-General,  who
has been available to the committee when we needed him, and to his  team  at
large. I also want to thank all the people who are doing  hard  work  behind
the scenes in the organisation for their dedication to  our  country.  Thank
you very much. [Applause.]

Ms J FUBBS (Gauteng): Hon Deputy  Chairperson,  thank  you  very  much,  hon
colleagues, Minister, Deputy Minister, chairperson of the  Select  Committee
on Finance, there is something I just want to start off with,  and  that  is
that these kinds of errors do occur. These errors  are  over  two  centuries
old. Mark Twain is often thought to have  said:  ``You  get  lies,  you  get
damned lies and you get  statistics.''  [Laughter.]  In  fact,  it  was  the
politician Disraeli of Britain who actually said that.

A budget debate affords us the time to focus on the progress  made  and  the
challenges that remain. The question that we ask is  how  far  this  budget,
the budget of statistics, is underpinning the  stated  objectives.  It  also
requires us to look back and see where we came from with statistics.

Certainly, there was an  element  of  academic  rigidity  before  the  first
democratic statistics that we had in the country. There was also an  element
of lack of relevancy. One recalls the days when the unemployment  figure  in
the statistics did not include black people  because  of  racial  ideologies
that were rampant at the time.

The objectives of  providing  the  statistics  that  will  provide  reliable
robust data for economic growth, development and democratic governance,  are
the stated objectives in  this  budget.  This  budget  is  not  a  time  for
sloganising or chewing on the political cud.  Many  of  us  are  very  naive
about figures and find it very difficult to relate numbers to  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty.

When it comes to statistics, there are  four  kinds  of  people.  There  are
those, perhaps like myself, who are awestruck by the figures  in  the  book,
and then there are the naive, the cynical and the critical. However,  if  we
are serious about democratic governance, about  ensuring  employment,  about
tackling the shortage of skills and about developing the  economy,  then  we
have no choice but to develop  a  keen  understanding  of  the  purpose  and
contribution of  statistics.  We  would  really  like  to  congratulate  the
Statistician-General  and  his  organisation  for  focusing   on   training,
upskilling and on  ensuring  that  this  country  will  develop  a  pool  of
qualified statisticians.

When we look at this budget, we are asked  to  go  behind  the  numbers  and
seriously engage on  how  best  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  data  is
selected, collected and analysed. Why?  As  an  instrument  to  improve  the
lives of others. Our Government has realised this  imperative,  and  Gauteng
welcomes all the restructuring that Statistics SA has  undergone  to  enable
greater relevance of the data.

The GDP initiative, for  example,  for  provinces  has  been  an  incredibly
constructive  help.  When  we  look  at  classrooms   for   education,   the
information we are now getting is enabling the MEC of Education to plan  the
expenditure of finances and other resources more  effectively,  because  the
MEC now has a better understanding of what is actually happening in  Gauteng
on the population demographics. The same goes for health.

We welcome this new census, because we are  quite  certain  that  the  fresh
realities that are current in Gauteng  will  certainly  lead  to  a  revised
allocation of funding. But there are other issues that are clear  from  some
of the statistical data that has given us a  better  disaggregation  on  the
lives of men and women, so that  we  now  have  a  better  understanding  of
exactly how women's time is spent. Is it simply a kitchen  anecdote,  or  do
women in fact have far less time than men to  educate  themselves,  to  read
the newspaper and so on, and what opportunities are available for  the  girl
child to realise her potential?

Sound statistics require good data, clear  and  reasonable  definitions  and
also appropriate samples, which I have touched  on  already.  However,  even
the best statistics become sanitised in isolation. I think  in  Gauteng  one
of the things that has really impressed  us  is  the  integration  of  data,
taking account of what it is that provinces need in order to plan.  What  do
departments, other institutions and  sectors  need  in  order  to  plan.  Of
course, it takes financial resources to provide a platform  in  which  users
can articulate their needs, and finally for this to produce a product  which
can be measured.  In  this,  we  hope  to  get  convergence  of  sustainable
statistics - statistics we can use.

Just a short comment as an aside: we know that we can  expect  to  see  some
very solid statistics. It  is  just  that  we  get  them  two  years  later,
understandably, there is a shortage of staff and so on. We get  to  utilise,
or rather to develop the formula  in  order  to  utilise,  that  information
another year later, that is three years later. We then get to implement  the
formula four years later.

Now, as I say, it is meant really to raise the concern and to indicate  that
we are aware that shortage of staff, and perhaps even  financial  resources,
may be contributing to this. Nevertheless, we  must  also  add,  it  is  far
better to wait for a reliable set of statistics, which we  have  done,  than
in the previous years just churn out any old batch  of  stuff  that  has  no
relation to what is going on in the country.

I would also ask Statistics SA to broaden the outreach programme,  not  only
to provinces but to schools and other institutions. We know you  have  begun
this work in provinces, we benefitted from it. This can be  strengthened  so
that statistics are not things that people become afraid of.  Just  on  that
error that we encountered, one of the  things  which  I  thought  was  quite
interesting was that after the Florida elections the myth about using  wrong
statistics was perpetuated. At the very least, when we  saw  the  error,  we
are  certainly  looking  into  the  matter  and  correcting  it,   and   not
perpetuating facts which are incorrect.  I  think  for  that  Statistics  SA
ought to be applauded.

Another thing that we also welcome is the tourism survey that  has  recently
been introduced, particularly in  Gauteng  where  short  stays  predominate.
That will give us some very useful information in  that  particular  regard.
The integration of registers, and so on, should  make  for  more  meaningful
data. Again, our new Gauteng trade  and  industrial  strategy  will  benefit
directly from the data coming out of  the  integration  of  these  registers
itself. [Time expired.] Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr  E  A  CONROY:  Agb  Voorsitter,  agb   Minister   van   Finansies,   agb
Adjunkminister van Finansies en kollegas, laat my toe om aan  die  begin  my
agb kollega uit Gauteng te korrigeer. Die  uitspraak  oor  leuens,  opperste
leuens en statistieke is nie die van Mark Twain of Disraeli  nie,  maar  dié
van die skrywer  Samuel  Clemens,  wat  die  skuilnaam  Mark  Twain  vir  sy
beroemde boeke oor Tom Sawyer en Huckleberry Finn gebruik het.

Voorsitter,  op  'n  meer  ernstige  noot.  Twee  jaar  gelede  het  ek,  na
aanleiding van 'n suksesvolle inligtingsbesoek van die  Gekose  Komitee  oor
Finansies  aan  Statistiek  SA  se  hoofkantoor  in   Pretoria,   waardering
uitgespreek vir die uiters belangrike werk wat hulle doen en  hulle  nogeens
bedank vir die bekwame wyse waarop hulle hul van hul taak kwyt.

Voorsitter, ek het by dieselfde geleentheid ook gesê, en  ek  haal  verbatim
aan:


  Omdat hul werk so onontbeerlik vir 'n  gladde  en  ekonomies  suksesvolle
  volkshuishouding is, is dit soveel te meer belangrik dat die  produk  wat
  hulle voortbring absoluut foutloos is; dat die produk feitlik blindelings
  vertrou kan word en aangewend  word  in  besluite  wat  groot  finansiële
  implikasies kan hê.

Ek het trouens by daardie geleentheid verder gewaarsku dat foute wat in  die
amptelike statistieke voorkom, die potensiaal het om  die  geloofwaardigheid
van  al  Suid-Afrika  se  ekonomiese  statistieke  by  veral  internasionale
finansiële instellings en beleggers onder verdenking te plaas en sakelui  se
taak om ingeligte besluite te neem, bemoeilik.

Voorsitter, reeds op daardie stadium het gevaarligte  oor  die  gehalte  van
SSA se werk begin flits toe hulle tot hul skande moes erken  dat  verwarring
in die berekening van die eerste  drie  kwartale  van  die  vorige  jaar  se
ekonomiese  groeikoers  geskep  is,  omdat  hulle   versuim   het   om   die
seisoensaangesuiwerde  jaarstatistieke  aan  te  pas.  Mens  sou  hoop   dat
welmenende en opbouende kritiek wat op daardie stadium  uit  verskeie  oorde
uitgespreek is, hulle sou aanspoor om introspeksie te  doen;  om  weer  eens
hul potlode skerp te maak en te sorg dat  daar  geen  swak  skakels  in  hul
ketting van uitnemendheid is nie.

Maar helaas, dit het blykbaar nie gebeur nie! Dit  is  nou  reeds  oorbekend
dat iemand van buite Statistiek SA, 'n ontleder in  die  privaatsektor,  die
ontdekking moes maak dat verkeerde groeisyfers in  die  huur  van  huise  en
woonstelle gebruik is by die berekening van die VPIX; dat ekonome  te  velde
getrek het oor die betroubaarheid en gehalte van Suid-Afrika  se  ekonomiese
statistieke toe dit verder ontdek is dat Suid-Afrika  se  inflasiesyfer  met
tot twee persentasiepunte laer kon wees as wat dit tot  op  daardie  stadium
aangedui is. En dit, ten spyte van die  feit  dat  dieselfde  privaat-sektor
ekonoom blykbaar reeds meer as 'n jaar  gelede  sy  bekommernis  uitgespreek
het oor die uitwerking van die 35% styging  in  huurkoste  en  SSA  blykbaar
niks aan die saak gedoen  het  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY:  Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  of  Finance,  hon  Deputy
Minister of Finance and colleagues, allow me first of all to correct my  hon
colleague from  Gauteng.  The  statement  about  lies,  outright  lies,  and
statistics is not that of Mark Twain or Disraeli, but  that  of  the  author
Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym  Mark  Twain  for  his  famous  books
about Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.

Chairperson,  on  a  more  serious  note.  Two   years   ago   I   expressed
appreciation, prompted by a  successful  information  visit  by  the  Select
Committee on Finance to Statistics SA's head office  in  Pretoria,  for  the
significant work that they are doing and thanked them  once  again  for  the
efficient way in which they perform their task.

Chairperson, on the same occassion I also said, and I quote verbatim:


  Omdat hulle werk so onontbeerlik vir 'n gladde en  ekonomies  suksesvolle
  volkshuishouding is, is dit nie soveel te meer belangrik dat  die  produk
  wat hulle  voortbring  absoluut  foutloos  is;  dat  die  produk  feitlik
  blindelings vertrou kan word en aangewend  word  in  besluite  wat  groot
  finansiële implikasies kan hê.

In fact, on that occasion I further cautioned that  errors  which  occur  in
official  statistics  have  the  potential   to   cause   suspicion,   among
international financial institutions and investors,  about  the  reliability
of all of South Africa's economic statistics, and  to  hamper  the  task  of
business people to make informed decisions.

Chairperson, at that stage already warning lights started to  flicker  about
SSA's work when they had to acknowledge to their own  shame  that  confusion
was caused in the calculations of the first three quarters of  the  previous
year's economic growth rate because they failed  to  adjust  the  seasonally
adjusted  annual  statistics.  One  would  hope  that  well   intended   and
constructive criticism which was expressed from  various  quarters  at  that
stage would have urged  them  to  become  introspective;  to  sharpen  their
pencils once again and to see to it that there are no weak  links  in  their
chain of excellence.

But unfortunately, this apparently did not happen! It is  now  already  well
known that someone from outside of Statistics SA, an analyst in the  private
sector, made the discovery that inaccurate growth rates for the  renting  of
houses  and  apartments  were  used  when  the  CPIX  was  calculated;  that
economists disputed the reliability and quality of South  Africa's  economic
statistics when it was further  discovered  that  South  Africa's  inflation
rate could have been two percentage points lower than it  was  indicated  at
that stage. And  this,  despite  the  fact  that  the  same  private  sector
economist, already more than a year ago, apparently  expressed  his  concern
about the impact of the 35% increase in  rentals,  and  apparently  SSA  did
nothing about the matter.]

Chairperson, the effect  of  this  error  will  not  be  immediately  known.
Although nobody is prepared to venture a guestimate,  some  economists  have
already indicated that it could cost the South  African  consumer  billions.
We, however, already know that young  consumers  who  have  bonds  on  their
homes and loans on their cars could not bear the unnecessary  high  interest
rates and they had to start returning some of their assets  to  the  lending
institutions, with a great financial loss to themselves.

Undoubtedly, some of them have also  fallen  in  arrears  as  far  as  their
monthly bond repayments are concerned. Even Salga has now entered  the  fray
by alleging that  SSA  is  responsible  for  the  looming  strike  by  local
authority workers, saying that the miscalculation of the  CPIX  figures  had
had a negative impact on their wage agreements across the  country  and  had
cause worker unhappiness.  It  had  the  effect  that  the  negotiated  wage
increase of 11% had to be lowered to 10,5% which, in monetary terms,  caused
a saving of R98 million for municipalities.

Voorsitter, dit sal egter nie help as ons nou in sak en  as  gaan  sit  nie.
Ons moet vorentoe kyk en hoop dat SSA die welmenende  en  opbouende  kritiek
ter harte sal neem, sal regmaak wat verkeerd is en baie seker sal  maak  dat
sulke foute nie herhaal word nie.

Trouens, dat hulle reeds die taak aangepak het om die verlore  vertroue  van
die Suid-Afrikaanse publiek te herwin.

Daar   sal,   onder   andere,   ernstig   daarna   gekyk   moet   word   dat
staatsdepartmente, soos byvoorbeeld die  Departement  van  Arbeid  en  ander
instellings  wat  spesiale  opnames  gedoen  wil  hê,  self  die  begrotings
daarvoor voorsien en nie  sal  verwag  dat  SSA  sy  eie  begrote  en  reeds
geoormerkte fondse daarvoor moet aanwend nie.

Verder moet die Minister van Finansies  moontlik  oorweging  skenk  aan  die
aanstelling van 'n  eksterne  modereringskomitee,  bestaande  uit  staats-en
privaat-sektor  ekonome  en  -statistici,  wat  op  'n  gereelde   grondslag
steekproewe  oor  die  korrektheid  van  SSA   se   metodes,   tegnieke   en
gepubliseerde verslae kan uitvoer. En moontlik oorweeg om 'n paar emmers  te
skenk vir die volgende reënstorm in Pretoria wanneer SSA se dak lek!

Voorsitter,  hoewel  met  voorbehoude,  maar  tog  met  die   vertroue   dat
Statistiek SA hiermee 'n dure les geleer het,  aanvaar  die  Nuwe  Nasionale
Party hierdie Begrotingspos. Dankie. [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, it will, however, not help us  to  wear  sackcloth  and  ashes
now. We must look ahead and hope that SSA will take  the  well-intended  and
constructive  criticism  to  heart,  will  rectify  the  mistakes  and  make
absolutely sure that such errors will not be repeated; in  fact,  that  they
have already started carrying out the task of regaining the lost  confidence
of the South African public.

There will have to be serious consideration, among  other  things,  for  the
fact that state departments, for instance  the  Department  of  Labour,  and
other institutions that require special surveys will  have  to  provide  the
budgets for that themselves, and not  expect  SSA  to  appropriate  its  own
budgeted and already allocated funds for that.

Furthermore,  the  Minister  of  Finance  should   possibly   consider   the
appointment of an external moderating committee, comprising  economists  and
statiticians from the state and the private sector, who will, on  a  regular
basis, perform spot-checks on the accuracy of SSA's methods, techniques  and
published reports. And possibly consider donating  a  few  buckets  for  the
next rain storm in Pretoria when SSA's roof is leaking!

Chairperson, though with reservations, but nevertheless with the  confidence
that Statistics SA learned a valuable lesson through this, the New  National
Party accepts this Budget Vote. Thank you. [Applause.]]

Mr M J BHENGU: Thank you, Chairperson. Thank you,  Raju.  Sir,  our  country
and people are in desperate need of growth and development  at  all  levels.
And for this to happen it is well-known that  policy-makers  and  agents  of
implementing changes need to be  well-aware  of  the  economic,  fiscal  and
social  dynamics  of  our  country.  And  this  is  basically  the  task  of
Statistics SA; the body which is entrusted  by  our  Government  to  provide
policy-makers and our nation at large with the correct  facts,  figures  and
realities associated with the complexities of our country.

There has been a serious, and of course  well-intentioned  campaign  on  the
part of the Statistician-General to disseminate  solid  information  to  the
public  via  newspaper  columns   nationally.   The   mere   fact   that   a
representative  of  the  private  sector  discovered  the  error   put   the
credibility of Statistics SA  in  serious  question.  This  meant  that  the
consumers paid a price  in  the  process  as,  since  2002,  interest  rates
increased four times. This hit the middle-classes and  the  poor  very  hard
indeed.

I do align myself with the sentiments  expressed  by  the  special  delegate
from Gauteng. As the  CPIX  is  used  by  our  Reserve  Bank  for  inflation
targeting, the fact that Statistics SA was using data  on  rental  inflation
dating back to 1999 proved a costly mistake in terms  of  our  international
credibility. There is a host of resultant questions  one  needs  to  ask  in
this context.  Are  there  any  other  such  errors  in  the  Statistics  SA
calculations in respect of our financial, economic and social estimates?  If
yes, how big are these errors? What steps are to be undertaken so that  such
errors will not be  repeated?  How  are  figures  and  facts  evaluated  and
monitored? How serious are these implications of such errors?

We all want to trust our statistical services because we  are  committed  to
the welfare of all our people, especially the poorest of the poor.  We  need
to count on the solid, honest and highly scientific information provided  by
Statistics South Africa; no more or less, no more. We need to be  alert  and
vigilant. To err is human; to forgive is divine;  so  goes  the  saying.  We
therefore say that the Statistician-General and the  team  must  not  repeat
this mistake again, but we forgive them.

Mr M I MAKOELA: Thank you, hon Deputy Chairperson. No  more  less,  no  more
more. Deputy Chairperson, until 1994, the Government  regularly  manipulated
data to comply with its vision of a divided society. We  cannot  deny  that.
Its statistics, even the census, left out so-called  independent  homelands,
which contained about a third of all South Africans. Even  figures  for  the
rest of South Africa - including, for instance, unemployment  data  and  the
income and expenditure survey used to calculate inflation -  usually  talked
to the handful of privileged people.

And today, it appears that the same beneficiaries of the old order are  lost
in a time warp because,  instead  of  doubting  national  statistics  during
those days, they choose to do so now.

Stats agencies in some of the  major  developing  countries  have  sometimes
also committed serious statistical errors. It has  been  mentioned  that  in
the USA it once  happened  that  they  had  to  revise  the  inflation  data
fundamentally  arguing  that  it  neglected  improvement  in  quality   that
underlies  some  price  increases.  Yet,  Statistics  SA  has  gone  far  in
remedying  the  faults  of  the  previous  regime,  complying  better   with
international norms than most developing countries.

The quest for best statistical practice has, within a very short  period  of
time, made a very big impact. South Africa was elected as a  member  of  the
United Nations Statistics Commission in May 2001. And as far  back  as  1996
South Africa subscribed to the IMF's special Data  Dissemination  Standards.
There is a very strict entry data requirement for member states.

Deputy  Chair,  it  is  Statistics  SA's  commitment  to  transparency   and
adherence  to  statistical  standards  that  provided  the   framework   and
environment for an individual citizen to  participate  in  its  revision  of
consumer inflation  figures,  which  reduced  inflation  by  two  percentage
points.

Stats SA ought to be commended for their attitude, because  once  they  were
made aware of the error they reacted spontaneously to address it. They  were
willing to listen to divergent viewpoints and  courageously  admitted  their
mistakes. This tells us that Stats SA  has  the  political  sensitivity  and
maturity to respond to an imperfect situation.

Stats South Africa produces many data  series  but  I  would  like  to  make
mention and reference to its survey  of  non-VAT  registered  businesses  in
South Africa. The survey gives information on the  potential  of  small  and
microbusinesses in the country to create employment  or  income  activities,
and to contribute to the economic growth of the country.

Stats SA ought to be complimented for  their  ingenuity  and  innovation  in
producing this data. Instead of using the conventional definition  of  small
and microbusinesses, it used a  very  different  yardstick  to  measure  all
small businesses.  Since  the  definition  of  ``formal''  and  ``non-formal
business'' varies from country to country, Stats SA used  the  criterion  of
not being registered for VAT  for  identifying  small  and  microbusinesses.
Businesses not registered for VAT are generally excluded from the sample  of
formal businesses. Non-VAT  registration  is  regarded  as  a  proxy  or  an
operational definition for informality. Members are aware that any  business
with an estimated annual turnover  of  R300  000  or  more  is  required  to
register for VAT. The survey tells us that a  total  of  734  000  employees
were working in non-VAT registered businesses and paid  about  R274  million
in gross salaries and wages to their workers.

Deputy Chairperson, with these few words I would like to thank you.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, hon Ministers,  hon  special  delegates,  the  hon
Minister  has  given  a  spirit  of  defence  of  the  Stats   SA   debacle.
[Interjections.] He has indeed conceded that such  errors  as  committed  by
Stats  SA  could  incapacitate  public  representatives.  Even  if  the  hon
Minister contends in a pointer to the hon Durr  that  the  animal  ``acurate
statistics'' is an alien creature, a figment of one's imagination,  or  even
a phantasmagoric apparition, the fact remains that Stats SA has  boobed  and
the consequences have been grave. Mistakes can be  costly,  as  indeed  they
were.

The duty of any responsible opposition  party  is  to  hold  the  Government
responsible and accountable  for  how  the  taxpayer's  money  is  spent  by
various Government departments.  For  Government  departments  to  determine
priorities before allocating millions of public rands, it is essential  that
data upon which onerous decisions are made, be  accurate  and  up  to  date.
Unfortunately, Stats SA suffered a slight aberration - or is it a tragedy  -
upsetting the Minister of Finance's apple cart in more ways than one.

It is unfortunate that the one Minister in the executive  who  has  done  an
admirable job for the country and the economy, in his capacity  as  Minister
of Finance, should  have  had  to  suffer  embarrassment  when  one  of  the
agencies under his control had to mess  up.  [Applause.]  The  hon  Minister
stands tall in the corridors of world finance and the Stats  SA  mishap  has
put him in an invidious position.  Incorrect  inflation  data  and  monetary
policy decisions  have  adversely  affected  a  range  of  payments  on  the
negative side.

The hapless South Africans, from the affluent to the poor, have had  to  pay
more for food, telephone services, postal services, water  and  electricity.
One can only imagine the devastating effect on bond repayments.  What  about
the cost of capital for SMMEs and even larger corporates? Stats  SA's  lapse
has also impacted on the  all-important  CPI  figures  -  that  means,  wage
settlements and tariffs that went off at  a  tangent.  That  much  has  been
conceded by the hon Dr Conroy on my left, an erstwhile member of the New  NP
- the erstwhile ally of the ANC.

Due to the distortions that have  occurred,  all  parastatals  have  had  to
institute  urgent  reviews  of  the  recent  tariff  increases,  which  were
obviously  based  on  the  flawed  Stats   SA   data.   In   addition,   all
municipalities that have passed budgets based on faulty  inflation  data  in
their budgetary projections and passed budgets  that  add  further  fuel  to
inflationary expectations, should review these decisions.

Consumers and ratepayers should not  be  made  to  pay  for  someone  else's
mistake.  [Interjections.]  Stats  SA,  though  independent  and   protected
against the executive interference in its statute,  remains  accountable  to
the Minister of Finance and he remains accountable  to  Parliament  for  the
actions, omissions and judgement errors under his wings.  The  hon  Minister
is obviously accountable for the actions and lapses on  the  part  of  Stats
SA. This House would like to know from the hon Minister - from  the  horse's
mouth, as it were - what went wrong? The same question was  echoed  by  none
other than my hon colleague, Mr John Bhengu. What went wrong? If  it  was  a
lack of funds, his duties to explain is  even  greater,  given  the  pivotal
importance of reliable statistics for sound policy and delivery.

If it was a lack  of  judgement  and  lapse  in  strategic  leadership,  and
therefore a disastrous judgement error on the  part  of  Stats  SA  and  the
Statistician-General, he must act and inform the House ...

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, on the point of  order:  Is  it  parliamentary
for the member to come and use Mr Gibson's speech here? [Laugher.]

The DEPUTY CHAIPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Well,  that's
not a point of order. We are not sure whose speech he is using.

Mr N M RAJU: The significance of  these  errors  cannot  be  overemphasised.
Every budgetary projection which used inflation indicators will have  to  be
adjusted. Monetary policy and monetary policy decisions that may  have  been
based on faulty data are equally in question. The DA does not  support  this
Budget Vote. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister  and  special
delegates, as the ANC we support the Budget Vote. But  as  we  do  that,  we
just want to remind the House of a creature - I am not sure  as  to  whether
it was called the House of Delegates or House of Representatives - in  which
the hon member served. This new Stats SA is undoing the kind  of  work  that
the hon member participated in. We have inherited a situation in  which  the
member and his party participated, namely in the House  of  Delegates.  They
created a structure to which my hon members had referred; a structure  which
never considered, for instance, for purposes of development,  black  people.
They developed all kinds of policies that had to do with development of  the
House of Delegates and Representatives without considering black people.

Secondly, there has been a boob campaign by the same party.  Not  long  ago,
they had a very funny campaign called the BIG. It has fizzled out  precisely
because it was a thumb-suck kind of a  campaign.  On  what  basis  was  that
campaign of the basic income grant  waged?  It  has  fizzled  out  precisely
because it was thumb-suck and not well-thought out  and  not  tested.  As  a
result, it has fallen apart. Again, today they  are  talking  about  another
issue. Again it is not tested  and  not  well-costed.  It  is  thumb-sucking
again. They talk about 150 000 policemen and women.  Surely,  again,  it  is
going to fizzle out, precisely because it is has no basis. It is a  populist
and opportunistic kind of a  campaign.  This  is  a  party  today  which  is
purporting to be spokespersons for the poor. They are trying  to  speak  for
the poor and apparently on behalf of our own people.

Ms B N SONO: Chairperson, on a point of order: Is  it  parliamentary  for  a
member to mislead the House about our  stand  on  the  basic  income  grant,
because the Umsobomvu Fund ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! What is the point of order?

Ms B N SONO: He is misleading the House by  saying  that  the  basic  income
grant has fizzled out, because we were misled - because of  Stats  SA?  Just
as a point of correction, the Umsobomvu Fund ...

The CHAIPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That is not a point of  order.  Continue,
Mr Ralane.

Mr T RALANE: Thank you very much. This is a party that is trying to woo  the
young of this country. Let me remind them that in my province this party  is
involved in the victimisation and intimidation of ordinary  men  and  women,
to be able to join the same party in the Northern Free State,  in  the  area
called Bothaville, for instance. This  is  where  ordinary  farmworkers  are
victimised by the DA to become members of its party.  Some  of  the  workers
have been dismissed and evicted - illegally so, by the members of  the  same
party in that part of the province. [Interjections.] This brings us  to  the
issue of the conditions of farmworkers on farms, especially when members  of
this party are so arrogant. This Government is trying to address the  plight
and the miseries of all the workers who are employees of the members of  the
same party.

Right here on this platform,  all  of  them  purport  to  be  champions  and
spokespersons of the poor. This is the kind of fraud  that  we  are  dealing
with here. This is the kind of people we are dealing with. All of us  agreed
when Minister gave his outline, that there have been human errors - and  its
a fact. Therefore,  we  clearly  can't  understand  whether  the  opposition
parties want to make a political gain out of these issues.  Instead  all  of
them ought to be assisting us in addressing the problems here. The  Minister
told us that, only in 2000, the first course of this nature  was  undertaken
in this country at Wits University. As a result we  don't  have  people  who
are properly qualified to be doing all these jobs.

This party  is  using  this  opportunistically  again  on  the  eve  of  the
elections. They are trying to get some of the votes. It's  a  pity  but  our
people will not be fooled by their gimmicks. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Chairperson. It's good that  the  debate
on Statistics SA is as spirited as this debate has  been.  It's  very  clear
that hon members here take the issue of statistics very  seriously.  I  said
earlier that those who work in statistical  agencies  tend  not  to  be  big
revolutionaries. They quietly go about their work, and I'm  glad  that  this
debate has generated so much fire and brimstone here today, Chairperson.

A number of issues were raised, and let me try and deal with  them  as  they
were raised. The first of these is that it takes a long time to produce  the
results of a census. Now, when we release the results  of  Census  2001,  it
would be 21 months - in fact, two days short of 21 months - since the  start
of the census. I should say that there will be  74  variables  available  in
Census 2001. In the UK, for 40 variables they took 24 months.  In  Australia
they took 18 months for 40 variables. In Canada they took 18 months  for  40
variables and the rest was released only after  three  years;  with  all  of
those people employed in Canada. And in  the  United  States,  they  release
headlines such as `Total population  ...  '  -  the  statisticians  call  it
``sex''; I call it ``gender''. There are just a few headlines like that  and
the rest comes out some 18 months later, and the last  of  the  figures  are
released as much as 36 months after the census has been  conducted.  So,  it
always takes time, and in relative terms I think that we aren't too far  off
the curve.

The second issue was raised by the hon Dr  Conroy  and  it  relates  to  the
adjustments. Now, the methodological  requirements  involve  a  readjustment
retrospectively. The norm had been  that  national  accounts  be  readjusted
every five years. With effect from 1999 - plus one year, so  it  would  have
been 2000 - there now is an annual adjustment so  that  you  don't  have  to
make these big variations retrospectively. And when that was done,  clearly,
there would have been three quarters where there were variations. It  wasn't
a failure of seasonal adjustment; it was a change in methodology. And  these
issues would be done from time to time in terms of  the  norms  of  national
accounts data, which are released after consultation by the IMF.

So, the methods are approved by the IMF and the issue that  the  hon  Conroy
referred to was that circumstance rather than a blaps [blunder]. Of  course,
what had compounded that release  was  that  in  one  year  agriculture  was
growing very well and because the rate of change wasn't as big, it  appeared
very flat and so that confounded the  numbers.  But  it  wasn't  a  seasonal
adjustment failure. Rather, it was a change in method.

In respect of the Statistics Council - and this is something  that  the  hon
Conroy referred to as well - it exists as a kind of quality-control  entity.
It's made  up  of  25  South  African  men  and  women,  nine  of  whom  are
representatives of the  provinces.  Part  of  our  difficulty  is  that  the
provinces appoint people and then forget that  those  individuals  represent
the provinces.
I pulled a fast one on MECs for finance the other day and said that I  would
pay for drinks for all of those who could name  the  representative  on  the
Statistics Council  from  that  province.  Only  one  member  knew  who  the
provinical rep  was  and  as  it  happens,  as  luck  would  have  it,  that
particular member does not consume alcohol. [Laughter.] So, I'm  in  a  very
good place, because Ebrahim Rasool indeed knew ...

An HON MEMBER: Madam Chair, he normally doesn't pay for drinks. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: But that council fulfils that role and I  spoke  of
members who've been giving more than 300 hours of  their  time.  It  is,  in
fact, their filtration role,  so  they  would  prepare  a  report  and  say,
``Minister,  we,  in  terms  of  the  Statistics  Act,  have  evaluated  the
following things about this undertaking and in the instance of  Census  2001
we are satisfied that you should  receive  in  good  faith.''  It's  a  very
important statement to make, because that is their quality-control  function
that they exercise.
But it's difficult. You can't ask people to find that amount of time.  Those
300 hours would be through  the  night;  often  throughout  the  night,  and
virtually every Saturday and Sunday people have given their time.  It's  not
possible for people to do that, so we need to examine how  we  can  find  or
restructure the way in which  the  council  operates.  It's  something  that
they've raised  with  us.  Some  might  be  in  a  more  technical  advisory
capacity, and others would then  fulfil  that  different  role,  that's  the
signing-off role. But these are issues that we would deal with.

I'd like to thank the divine Bhengu for his divine forgiveness.  [Laughter.]


I'm very pleased to see the hon Raju is an  avid  reader,  because  what  he
shared with us - these scare stories that make the hairs on your neck  stand
on end - are  from  the  very  latest  J  K  Rowling's  Harry  Potter  book.
[Laughter.] It bears no relation to the subject at hand.  It's  designed  to
scare, but we commend the member for being such an avid reader,  because  we
need to inculcate good reading habits amongst our people. [Laughter.]

In respect of what he said, I think  he's  very  correct  about  being  held
accountable  for  the  spending  of  departments.  However,  I  think   he's
incorrect in his reading of the Statistics Act,  because  the  Act  is  very
clear in designing the duties and powers of  the  Minister  as  against  the
responsibilities of the Statistician-General. The  Statistician-General,  it
says:


  (d) directs Statistics SA  in  accordance  with  the  duties  and  powers
       imposed or conferred on him or her by this Act ... ;


  (e)  determines,  and  exercises  final  responsibility   regarding   the
       implementation of, the work programme of Statistics SA, including -


       (i)  the collection, compilation and analysis of official  statistics
              in accordance with the purpose of official statistics ...;


       (ii) the times when and the manner in which  statistical  collections
              are undertaken and the  form  of  any     document  pertaining
              thereto;


       (iii)       the  manner  in  which  data  are  processed,  documented
              and stored;


       (iv) the form, extent  and  timing  of  the  release  of  statistical
              information.

But, in  dealing  with  this,  the  Act  actually  creates  an  arm's-length
relationship, because it does not allow a Minister to interfere in the  work
of Statistics SA. What we build in this  organisation  must  be  durable.  I
think all of us, as South Africans, need to know that you  aren't  going  to
have a situation ... I mean, I'd like to be  placed  in  a  position  where,
before the elections in 2004, I can say to  Statistics  SA,  ``Now  make  me
look good.''
The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! I'm afraid your time has expired.

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: But I say thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

              (Consideration of Votes of and Schedules to Bill)

Vote No 1 - Presidency - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mnr P  A  MATTHEE:  Voorsitter,  dis  aangenaam  vir  die  Nuwe  NP  om  die
begrotingspos van die Presidensie te steun. [Chairperson, it is  a  pleasure
for the New NP to support the Budget Vote of the Presidency.]

We especially wish to thank the  President  and  Deputy  President  for  the
passion and enthusiasm  with  which  they  provide  leadership  on  the  new
challenge that faces all of us as South Africans, now  that  the  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission has completed its work, namely to further  advance
the goal of national reconciliation. We wish to  assure  the  President  and
the whole of South Africa that in the interest of all South  Africans,  that
we in the New NP  shall  work  together  with  this  Government,  under  his
leadership, to help build the new united, nonracial,  nonsexist  democratic,
safe and prosperous South Africa to which the overwhelming majority  of  all
our people are committed.

In spite of all the efforts of the DA under the leadership of Tony  Leon  to
derail this process of reconciliation, and despite  the  short-term  effects
of their poison on the minds of our people by exploiting  their  most  basic
fears through false propaganda and blatant  untruths,  we  will  succeed  in
getting all South Africans of goodwill to join us on  the  exciting  journey
that will lead us to the humane, caring and peaceful society  for  which  so
many South Africans, from all sides, sacrificed their lives.
Let us take hands to overcome  our  divided  past  and  embrace  our  common
future together.

Mr T RALANE:  Chairperson,  the  national  Parliament  has  implemented  our
policies in a manner that holds this institution accountable to  the  people
we serve. Besides being transparent, our Parliament democratically  develops
and pursues a legislative agenda which is commensurate with  the  objectives
of progressive forces supporting transformation in this country.

Therefore, the ANC supports this Budget Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 2 - Parliament - put and agreed to in accordance with section 75  of
the Constitution..

Vote No 3- Foreign Affairs - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr  B  J  TOLO:  Chairperson,  before  1994,  South  Africa   was   isolated
internationally due to its  internal  policies  of  apartheid  and  national
oppression. That policy was abhorred by  all  progressive  mankind.  It  was
even declared a crime  against  humanity  by  the  UN.  Since  we  took  our
rightful place in the community  of  nations  of  the  world  in  1994,  and
apartheid also took its rightful place in the museum of  history,  alongside
the spinning  wheel,  the  South  African  foreign  policy  has  focused  on
building a prosperous, nonracial and nonsexist country.

Our vision has always been and will remain in the  foreseeable  future,  the
realisation of peace, stability, democracy, development in  Africa  and  the
achievement of equitable wealth.  The  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  has
successfully put our country on the international  map.  Today,  when  South
Africa speaks, the whole world listens.

Recently, our President was invited  to  address  the  International  Labour
Organisation, which he did. Organisations of such calibre do not invite  any
Tom, Dick and Harry. Those who read and listen to  news  will  remember  the
comments of some of the people  who  attended  that  meeting.  We  are  also
informed that the President  will  address  the  CARICOM  Organisation  next
week. This is a  reflection  of  foreign  policy  which  is  seen  as  being
progressive and a policy that is receptive to the international community.

Today we can stand tall as  a  nation  that  is  respected  internationally,
thanks to the sterling work of the Department of  Foreign  Affairs.  Nepad,a
brain child of South Africa and the President of our  country,  among  other
people, is a programme that is respected both at home and abroad as  a  road
map  for  the  realisation  of  the  African  Renaissance.  It  is  a  vivid
expression of our foreign policy.

The  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  has  led  us  to  earn  very  serious
leadership positions in the world arena, within a very short space of  time.
There is the Nonaligned Movement, the Commonwealth and the  AU.  Our  global
prominence was given further  impetus  by  the  hosting  of  very  important
global meetings. In June 2000  we  hosted  the  World  Aids  Conference.  We
hosted the World Conference Against Racism in 2001 and  in  2002  we  hosted
both  the  inaugural  meeting  of  the  AU  and  the  World  Conference  for
Sustainable Development.

Peace and security are prerequisites for development anywhere. For Nepad  to
succeed, we need these prerequisites. It  is  for  this  reason  that  South
Africa is engaged in brokering peace in many African countries. As we  speak
today, our boys and girls are in several African countries such as the  DRC,
Burundi, Ethopia, Eritrea and other countries; not as aggressors,  like  the
apartheid forces used to be, but as  peace  brokers.  They  are  sacrificing
their lives so that Africa can realise peace.

The ANC supports this Vote unreservedly.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 4 - Home Affairs - put and agreed to in accordance with  section  75
of the Constitution (ACDP dissenting).

Vote No 5 - Provincial and Local Government - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank you very much, Chairperson. Hon  members,  I  firmly
believe that it is ironic that, on this historic day  of  commemorating  the
declaration of the blueprint for a democratic South Africa,  famously  known
as the Declaration of Human Rights of 1995, that the right of  the  majority
to govern themselves is put to question by a minority. Of course  they  have
a right to that. But, in doing so, as I said earlier on in  my  speech  this
week, they just confirm one fact: The people of this country  are  ready  to
govern. Municipalities are putting forward  the  necessary  initiatives  and
processes to ensure that  the  checks  and  balances  are  in  place.  These
measures are still evolving ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Please take a seat, hon  Mkhaliphi.  Hon
Lever, are you raising on a point of order?

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I also wish to  make  a  declaration  in  answer,
when this hon member has completed his statement.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Well,  we  will  allow  you  to  make  a
declaration. I do not know whether it will in response as a  declaration  on
the Vote. Its content will be determined by  yourself.  Please  proceed,  Mr
Mkhaliphi.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: The necessary checks and balances are  in  place  and  are
still evolving. The tools are also in place  to  enforce  accountability  to
give support and to exercise oversight. However, what is clear is  that  the
so-called opposition has no plan to play their role effectively.  They  only
oppose and do not offer us with an alternative plan. The ANC views  this  as
merely a way of destabilising a very credible  system  of  local  government
that is moving forward. We therefore have  no  alternative  but  to  support
this Vote.

Mr L G LEVER: Thank you, Chairperson. I just wish to  correct  the  previous
speaker. The DA does by no means challenge the  right  of  the  majority  to
govern. We have, of course, the right ... [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! That  is  not  a  declaration  of  vote.
Please make a declaration of vote.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I will indeed. What we do have a right to  object
to, is the way the Budget is being  applied  in  this  particular  Vote.  We
object because the goods are not being delivered. There are  so  many  local
governments in dire straits and this is the  basis  of  the  Vote  which  we
exercise today.

Vote No 9 - Public Enterprises - put.

Declarations of vote:

Mrs C NKUNA: Chairperson, we support  the  Minister  of  Public  Enterprises
because we recognise the need to restructure state-owned  enterprises  in  a
responsible way. We also consider our background  history  of  apartheid  in
which the DP has participated so much.

We also appreciate the fact that the DA, that is never satisfied, at  least,
has  recognised  and  appreciates  the  listing  of  the   Telkom   on   the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. On other areas where the DA is  expressing  its
dissatisfaction to this House, we do not consider these  as  weaknesses.  We
see them as  challenges  and  strength,  which  come  as  a  result  of  the
democratic situation in which we find ourself.  The  situation  is  one  for
which we fought so tirelessly so that the DP can also enjoy the  freedom  of
speech and criticise this very same Government. The ANC supports Vote No  9,
thank you, Chairperson.

Vote No 12 - South  African  Management  Development  Institute  -  put  and

Vote No 13 - Statistics SA - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, on behalf of the ANC I  would  like  to  state
that the Vote 13 is one  of  the  Votes  that  this  House  should  support,
because it will enable the organisation to enable us  to  produce  empirical
data that our country so much  need  for  the  purposes  of  redressing  the
imbalances of the past. I would like to call upon all members to  allow  the
organisation  to  grow,  criticise  it  constructively  where   it   becomes
appropriate, but also to give this organisation  a  chance  and  support  it
from time to time. On behalf of the ANC we support the Budget Vote.

Dr E A CONROY: Dankie, Voorsitter. Soos reeds in my toespraak genoem,  steun
die Nuwe NP begrotingspos 13 met die voorbehoud dat Statistiek SA  alles  in
sy vermoë sal doen om sy gekneusde openbare beeld te  herstel.  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Thank you, Chairperson. As I have already mentioned in my speech,  the  New
NP Supports  Budget  Vote  No  13  on  condition  that  Statistics  SA  does
everything within its means to restore its battered public image.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, die Nuwe NP steun hierdie begrotingspos  en
wens die departement sterkte toe met die taalbeleid en  -plan  wat  ingestel
moet word sodat al ons mense in dié land bemagtig kan word in die  taal  van
hulle keuse.

Die Nuwe NP het egter 'n bekommernis ten opsigte van  die  oorvleueling  van
die werk in die departement se taaldiens en die  funksionering  van  Pansat.
Hierdie oorvleueling bedreig  die  onafhanklikheid  van  Pansat  en  dit  is
ongrondwetlik en ook teenstrydig met die Pansat-wetgewing. Die  moontlikheid
moet oorweeg word om Pansat te voeg by die  ondersoek  wat  op  die  oomblik
gedoen word oor die onafhanklikheid van die Hoofstuk 9-instansies  soos  die
Menseregtekommissie, die Openbare Beskermer ens.

'n Duidelike definiëring van  die  pligte  en  verantwoordelikhede  van  die
taaldiens in die departement is nou nodig, veral op  die  vooraand  van  die
totstandkoming van die Kommissie vir die Beskerming en Bevordering van Taal-
,  Kultuur-  en  Godsdiensregte  van   Gemeenskappe.   Ons   steun   hierdie
begrotingspos. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the New NP supports this Budget  Vote  and
wishes the department every strength  with  the  language  policy  and  plan
which must be implemented so that all our people  in  this  country  can  be
empowered in the language of their choice.

The New NP, however, is concerned about the  overlap  of  the  work  in  the
department's language service and the functioning of PanSALB.  This  overlap
threatens the independence of PanSALB and is  unconstitutional  as  well  as
contrary to PanSALB legislation. The possibility  of  involving  PanSALB  in
the investigation that is currently taking place into  the  independence  of
Chapter 9 institutions such as  the  Human  Rights  Commission,  the  Public
Protector, etc, should be considered.

A clear definition of  the  duties  and  responsibilities  of  the  language
service in the department is now necessary, especially on  the  eve  of  the
establishment  of  the  Commission  for  the  Protection  and  Promotion  of
Linguistic, Cultural and Religious Rights of Communities.  We  support  this
Budget Vote.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Declarations of vote:

Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, the New NP supports the Education Budget  Vote  but
we would request the Minister and the Department of Education to  make  sure
that they do not overburden  our  schools  by  implementing  change  without
taking our history in consideration. We support the Budget Vote.

Rre D M KGWARE: Modulasetulo, re ratile go tsaya sebaka se go leboga  le  go

[Mr D M KGWARE: Chairperson, we would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to
thank and encourage our leaders to keep it up, seeing that  the  educational
programme that was instituted by the ANC has made  progress.  If  there  are
any changes that need to be made, we shall speedily effect them.

Our reason for doing that is that, judging by the events of 1976,  education
is of paramount importance to  our  organisation.  We  want  to  once  again
encourage our leaders and to promise that changes will  take  place  and  we
will make progress.

The ANC will ensure that our financial programme is strengthened, to see  to
it that progress is made.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 16 - Health - put.

Declaration of vote:

Ms L JACOBUS: Chairperson, I rise on behalf of the  ANC  to  support  Budget
Vote No 16 on Health. We  are  fully  aware  of  the  vital  role  that  the
Ministry of Health plays in creating a healthier and  better  live  for  all
our people. We were very encouraged that  provinces  were  maximising  their
health budgets, even those provinces that had smaller allocations  like  the
province  of  Limpopo.  We  note  substantial  budgetary  increases  in  the
previously disadvantaged  provinces  like  Mpumalanga,  the  Northern  Cape,
North West and the Eastern Cape.

We discovered through our inputs  in  our  intergovernmental  fiscal  review
briefings that there is still a lot to be done. We need  to  re-examine  our
distribution of the equitable share to the various provinces.  International
organisations such as the WHO, and indeed  our  own  Department  of  Health,
have set  very  high  standards  in  the  delivery  of  quality  health-care
services in every province. Every province is expected to  meet  and  indeed
surpass these standards.

Provinces therefore should and must be given  both  additional  funding  and
the necessary training to perform to their  maximum  potential.  We  believe
that this Ministry through its budget allocations will  move  us  closer  to
our objectives of a health and better life for our people through  budgetary
increases in the integrated nutrition  programme,  the  primary  health-care
programme and the enhanced response to the  HIV/Aids  strategy.  We  support
the Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance and African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

Vote No 17 - Labour - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: Chairperson, this Budget Vote ensures that the  Minister  is
able to actively promote the health and safety of people  in  the  workplace
and contribute to the national skills  development  strategy.  Other  issues
are the national human resource development strategy and  the  reduction  of
unemployment and all the other social ills associated with unemployment.

The department  has  successfully  implemented  a  number  of  projects  and
programmes in an effort to reduce unemployment,  poverty  and  inequalities,
aimed at improved economic  efficiency.  This  includes  a  national  skills
development  strategy,  which  contributes  to  the  implementation  of  the
national human resource development strategy.

The Skills Development, Act No 97 of 1998, strengthens the link between  the
workplace,  education  and  training,   economic   growth   and   employment
opportunities, occupational health and  safety  which  promotes  health  and
safety in workplaces, social insurance  which  provides  for  administrative
and  other  support  services,  to  the  unemployment  insurance  funds  and
compensation fund.  The  unemployment  insurance  fund  provides  short-term
income replacement for the unemployment, those unemployed  due  to  temporal
illness, and so forth.

The ANC is encouraging the Minister  to  remain  focused  on  developing  an
integrated employment strategy that will address this  Government's  biggest
challenge, and that is to create an enabling environment for employment.  We
believe that, in addition to other initiatives by the department,  the  high
unemployment rate in South Africa must also be addressed by  establishing  a
high-quality workplace, education and  training  system.  This  Ministry  is
therefore employing  a  multifaceted  approach  to  curb  high  unemployment
rates. Therefore, the ANC supports this Budget Vote. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 18 - Science and Technology put and agreed  to  in  accordance  with
section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 19 - Social Development - put.

Declaration of vote:
Ms P R MASHANGOANE: The African National Congress supports the  Budget  Vote
on Social Development because we believe that  this  Ministry,  through  its
budget allocation, will move us closer to our objectives  which  is  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty. This Ministry's  budget,  especially  through
its various grants like the  extended  child  support  grant  and  increased
pension  grant,  is  still  by  far  this   Government's   biggest   poverty
alleviation programme. We moved from  2,5  million  beneficiaries  in  April
1997 to 5,6 million in March 2003. This budget indicates  increases  in  the
equitable share and conditional grants to provinces.

We are confident that after the thorough interrogation of  the  budget  that
we engaged in with the Department of Social Development and the Treasury  by
way of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review briefings, we now  have  a  clear
understanding of the needs of all provinces. At the same  time  we  have  no
doubt that the Treasury was made fully aware of the  shortfalls  experienced
by  some  provinces  with  regard  to  their  budget  allocations.  We  have
confidence that the Minister is focusing his budget allocation where  it  is
needed  most.  We  look  forward  to  an  improvement  in   human   resource
allocations so that we can deliver services in keeping with our  Batho  Pele
principle. Thank you, Chairperson.

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 20 - Sport and Recreation - put.

Declaration of vote:

Ms N P KHONOU: Madam Chair, on behalf of the ANC I  support  the  Vote.  The
Ministry has shown its commitment to ensure  that  our  sport  codes  become
representative and that sport focus on the  development  of  facilities  and
the training of black  communities  that  were  historically  disadvantaged.
There is indeed great improvement and we are reaching our goal, which is  to
involve everyone. We are also impressed  by  the  involvement  of  women  in
sport. Therefore, we support this Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 21 - Correctional Services - put.

Declaration of vote:

Mof J L KGOALI: Modulasetulo, ke a leboha, ke leboha sebaka sena. Ho  ya  ka

[Mrs J L KGOALI: Chairperson, thank you for  this  opportunity.  Considering
how the Department of Correctional Services managed its programmes, and  how
members of this House, together with the opposition  parties  took  part  in
this, it is really surprising today to find that there are still people  who
are opposing this department's budget. Considering where we come  from,  and
where we are going, it is clear and  simple,  but  those  who  do  not  have
objectives and the responsibility for developing their country, will  always
oppose this department's budget.

We as the ANC really believe that the department  is  on  the  right  track.
Thank you.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Are there any further declarations of votes?

Mr P A MATTHEE: Madam Chair ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I  understand  the  declarations  are  one  per
party  per  vote.  Therefore,  hon  Matthee,  there  has  already   been   a
declaration from the ANC. I am not sure why the ANC would stand up and  make
a further declaration.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, on a  point  of  order:  There  must  be  a
misjudgement somewhere, because Mr Matthee is a member of the New NP.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  The  hon  member  will  recall  that  the  hon
Matthee was sworn in, in this House, by the hon Judge President of the  Cape
as a representative of the ANC. [Laughter.] The member may shake  his  head,
but that is  a  fact.  I  have  the  certification  from  the  KwaZulu-Natal
legislature which, if you demand, I would present to you, but  I  would  not
speak untruths from the Chair. The hon member was sworn in as  a  member  of
the ANC, as was the hon member Adams from the Western Cape.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: I wish to let it be noted that I object to what is  said
now and would like us to pursue the matter further. It  is  not  that  I  am
against your ruling. We have discussed this previously and we were  awaiting
a legal opinion on it and that was not  forwarded  to  us  at  all.  He  was
nominated by the KwaZulu-Natal legislature but he has no membership  of  the
ANC. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP:  Well,  that  is  a  very  serious  matter  and
certainly it should be looked at. It will be investigated,  because  it  may
mean that the KwaZulu-Natal legislature has  performed  something  which  we
would have to correct. As  I  have  indicated,  on  the  certification,  the
member is indicated as a member representing the ANC; as is  the  case  with
the Western Cape representative  the  hon  Adams.  We  will  return  to  the
matter.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 22 - Defence - put.

Declaration of vote:

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, before 1994, in this  country  we  had  the
SADF. During the negotiations this Government,  however,  made  it  possible
for the SADF to be integrated with the people's  army,  Umkhonto  we  Sizwe,
and some other armies to form the SANDF. While we  are  comfortably  in  our
houses enjoying ourselves, this force is looking after our borders. As I  am
speaking now, our Defence Force is assisting in peacekeeping in  some  other
countries on the continent.  There  is  no  way  any  self-respecting  South
African, any patriotic South  African,  can  oppose  this  budget.  The  ANC
support this Budget Vote.

Vote agreed to in accordance of section 75 of the  Constitution  (Democratic
Alliance dissenting).

Declaration of vote:

Mr T RALANE: Thank you, Chairperson. Our security agencies  work  tirelessly
at  implementing  the  National  Crime  Prevention  Strategy   targeted   to
prioritise crime, and police areas with the  highest  incidence  of  serious
crimes. Moreover,  the  Department  of  Safety  and  Security  continues  to
improve  the  capacity  of  the  Police  Service  to  discharge  its   crime
prevention and combating responsibilities in areas most  adversely  affected
by crime. Therefore, the ANC supports this Budget Vote.

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution

Vote No 26 - Agriculture - put and agreed to in accordance with  section  75

Vote No 27 - Communications - put.
Declaration of vote:

Mrs C NKUNA: Thank you, Chairperson. We believe  that  the  Minister  is  on
track with our objectives to make communication accessible to all.

Xin'wana hileswaku hi twa hi tinyungubyisa ngopfu loko hi vona  leswaku  eka

able to speak all our languages and to listen to the news  in  Xitsonga,  as
befits this Budget Vote.]

Lastly, we are also comfortable with the new management structures in  place
in the Postal Services and believe that these changes will go a long way  in
picking up the pace at which corruption will be rooted out.

Declaration of vote:

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter,  die  Nuwe  NP  herbevestig  sy  steun  vir
grondhervorming en vir die  volhoubaarheid  daarvan.  Die  Nuwe  NP  is  ook
bekommerd en besorg oor die gereelde aankondigings uit die  departement  dat
daar nie genoeg fondse beskikbaar is om grondhervorming  te  laat  plaasvind
nie, en ons vra dat daar duidelikheid gegee moet word  oor  die  omvang  van
die tekorte wat aangevul moet  word  om  grondhervorming  'n  sukses  en  'n
werklikheid in Suid-Afrika te maak. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  declaration
of vote follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, the New  NP  reconfirms  its  support  for
land restitution and for the sustainability thereof.  The  New  NP  is  also
concerned and anxious about the frequent announcements from  the  department
that there are not sufficient funds available for land restitution  to  take
place, and we ask that  clarity  be  given  as  regards  the  scope  of  the
deficits, which should be supplemented in order for land restitution  to  be
a success and a reality in South Africa.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Declaration of vote:

Ms D M RAMODIBE: Thank you, Chairperson. It is indeed an honour  for  me  to
stand before this Council in  this,  the  9th  year  of  the  democratically
elected Government of the people for the  people  by  the  people,  to  talk
about achievements in  the  Department  of  Minerals  and  Energy.  In  1955
millions of our people  were  excluded  from  participating  in  the  mining
sector. This sector was predominantly white as it was owned  and  controlled
by them.

Today, as the Freedom Charter  clearly  stipulates  that  the  people  shall
share in the country's wealth, the Department of  Minerals  and  Energy  has
consistently strived for transformation in the mining  sector  to  meet  the
physical needs of South African communities and to improve  the  quality  of
life of particularly poor and marginalised sectors such  as  women.  Through
its various programmes the department has been able to  successfully  create
thousands of job opportunities for South Africans.

It has successfully implemented a number  of  projects,  amongst  which  the
formation of Mine Qualifications Authority to facilitate the  develoment  of
appropriate knowledge and  skills  in  the  mining,  mineral  and  jewellery
sectors. These achievements  are  indicative  of  the  ANC's  commitment  to
translate transformation into tangible benefits  for  poor  South  Africans.
Those who have suffered under apartheid enjoy  change  and  those  who  have
benefited are dissatisfied.

Ke kgomo ya mosate wa e gapa o molato wa e lesa o molato. [It is a  catch-22
situation.]

The ANC supports the Vote. I thank you. [Interjections.]

Vote agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

Vote No 32 - Trade and Industry - put.

Declarations of vote:

Ms B N SONO: The core business of the DTI is to provide economic  leadership
through  its  understanding  of   the   economy,   knowledge   of   economic
opportunities and anticipation of the future. Loosely  translated,  this  is
the opening statement of their vision. Loosely translated, it should be  the
engine room for economic growth and development behind the  Government  with
a bold plan to stimulate growth and create jobs that will see rising  living
standards, especially for historically disadvantaged people.

Firstly, the DTI's present model of the  BEE  strategy  leaves  much  to  be
desired. The real answer is to have the  kind  of  approach  to  development
that puts investment in the economy and infrastructure  alongside  investing
in people. Even the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and  Industry  in  the
National Assembly begged the department to go back to the drawing  board  to
review this strategy. [Interjections.]

Secondly,  a  strategy  for  the  formal  economy  that  would  enable  both
established and emerging small and medium businesses to create jobs,  absorb
labour and reduce the high unemployment levels, which now stand at  40%,  is
sorely lacking. [Interjections.] Not enough is being done to  stimulate  the
economy and not enough jobs are being created.

Thirdly, amongst other national departments the DTI has 26,14% and 28,7%  of
their budget respectively unspent for this financial year.  This  department
shows extraordinary mediocrity under a Minister who  implements  policy.  We
therefore object to the Budget Vote. [Interjections.]

Mr R Z NOGUMLA: I rise on behalf of the ANC in support  of  Budget  Vote  No
32. Since  1994,  the  DTI  has  contributed  directly  to  the  process  of
transformation, reconstruction and economic development in South Africa.  It
has remained committed to its objectives to grow  investments  and  exports,
grow markets for South African  products  abroad,  grow  small,  medium  and
micro-enterprises, grow women-owned enterprises,  redress  the  inequalities
in the economy  through  bringing  the  previously  disadvantaged  into  the
mainstream, grow the  Southern  African  Development  Community  region  and
assist  with  the  New  Partnership   for   Africa's   Development,   reduce
geographic, spatial development inequalities by spreading  investments  over
the provinces and create a fair and efficient market place  for  a  business
and consumer alliance.
All the programmes implemented by this  department  have  been  successfully
done. Quite a number of projects have been implemented and also a number  of
entities that are committed to its  objectives  have  been  formed.  In  the
report to  the  department  it  includes  the  Ntsika  Enterprise  Promotion
Agency,  Khula  Enterprises,  the  National  Co-ordinating  Office  of   the
Manufacturing  Advisory  Office,  Technology  for  Women  in  Business,  the
Industrial Development  Corporation  and  the  Council  for  Scientific  and
Industrial Research. The CSIR is  the  principal  research  organisation  in
Africa committed  to  innovations  supporting  sustainable  development  and
economic  growth,  and  also  creating  value  for  clients,  partners   and
stakeholders.

These achievements are indicative  of  the  ANC's  commitment  to  translate
transformation into tangible benefits for poor South Africans.  We  strongly
believe that the current budget will build these achievements and  allow  us
to extend these benefits  to  even  more  South  Africans  during  the  next
financial year. [Interjections.] I thank you. [Applause.]
Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 33 - Transport - put.

Declaration of vote:

Dr P J C NEL: Thank you, Madam Chair. Before I start, I would like to say  I
was very pleased to read in Die Burger this morning that  the  hon  Minister
of Transport is back in his office. We wish him well. [Applause]

The New National Party supports  the  Budget  Vote.  We  do,  however,  have
concerns regarding some aspects. It was very discouraging to learn from  the
business plan of the departmental document that the backlog with  regard  to
road and commuter rail capital and infrastructure  had  escalated  over  the
years to such an extend that it might  lead  to  unacceptable  consequences,
should it not be addressed adequately within the medium term.

However, it is encouraging that the South African National  Road  Agency  is
going to take responsibility for the upgrading and  maintenance  of  several
national routes and  provincial  roads  that  form  part  of  the  strategic
primary road network that currently falls under the control of  the  various
provinces. I have no doubt in my mind that this programme will  bring  great
relief  for  most  of  the  provinces  which  are   experiencing   budgetary
shortfalls at the moment, and I would like to thank the Minister for that.

My party is also concerned about the fact that the Department  of  Transport
seemingly has a major problem with poor management of  traffic  information.
Currently no information is available for a number of  serious  injuries  on
our  roads.  Apparently,  information  is  collected  only  for  fatal  road
accidents and according to the department, statistics in  respect  of  fatal
road accidents for 2002 will only be available towards the middle  of  2003.
Soldiers cannot be sent to a battlefield if they do not know  the  strengths
of the enemy. The enemy is killing plus minus 10 000 of our people  annually
on our  roads.  I  hope  the  hon  Minister  will  deal  with  this  problem
effectively in the near future. [Applause.]

Vote  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  75  of   the   Constitution
(Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Vote No 34 - Water Affairs and Forestry - put and agreed  to  in  accordance

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                 (Consideration of Bill and Report thereon)

Mr T RALANE: Minister, Deputy Minister  and  special  delegates.  The  Joint
Budget Committe notes the following: The present  South  African  Government
under the guidance of ANC delivered its 10th budget  on  26  February  2003.
The 2003 Budget takes us up on another rung on  the  ladder  of  social  and
economic progress.

Additional expenditure on social services, such as the child support  grant,
education,  land  restitution,  health   and   food   relief   projects   is
unprecedented. The early announcement of transfers by the National  Treasury
to local government and  municipalities  is  a  fine  demonstration  of  our
continual involvement in intergovernmental fiscal relations.

The R13,3 billion tax relief for individuals who are  the  low  and  middle-
income earners is yet again most welcome tax reform.

An above-inflation increase of old-age pensions  and  disability  grants  to
R700 is noteworthy. The amnesty from prosecution offered to  South  Africans
with funds illegally held offshore is a reflection and  application  of  the
ANC-led Government's  critical  strategy  for  conflict  resolution  between
political adversaries but applied in this case  to  the  disharmony  between
Revenue Service and citizens.

It is also noted that opposition parties  have  objected  for  the  sake  of
objection to several of the departmental  Budget  Votes.  Unfortunately,  an
obvious conclusion is that, resistance  to  the  process  of  transformation
takes the form of unreasoned opposition that is tantamount to hostility.  In
defiance of the fact that such conflict destroys the essence  of  democratic
debate, it is distressing to us that opposition parties seek to  hinder  and
restrain the putting in place of a process that seeks  to  benefit  all  our
people.

The Joint Budget Committee would like to refer members of this House to  its
recommendations when exercising  their  oversight  functions.  Some  of  the
recommendations are published in the ATC of Wednesday, 18 June 2003.

The following are some of the recommendations: Further capacity have  to  be
built into financial management procedures to  ensure  compliance  with  the
Public Finance Management Act of 1999; Strategic  plans  of  the  department
have  to  be  scrutinised  to  ensure  the  redress  of   underspending   or
overspending before departments proceed to plan  for  new  projects;  formal
structured co-operation between the committee and other sectoral  committees
of Parliament is necessary to permit the flow of information, in respect  of
peculiar departmental spending patterns and  in  the  provincial  sphere  of
government,  greater  co-ordination  is  necessary  between  treasuries  and
Minmecs to ensure that decisions taken  at  Minmec  level  are  sufficiently
budgeted for.

As elected representatives we have an  overwhelming  task  of  focusing  not
only on the national budget but also on the budget  of  the  nine  provinces
and the 284 municipalities. Elected representatives are  expected  to  focus
on outputs and outcomes to be delivered by all three spheres of Government.

The Joint Budget Committee congratulates  the  National  Treasury  of  South
Africa  once  again  for  fulfilling,  with  distinction,   not   only   its
Constitutional responsibility but also its mandate.

We urge the House to support the Appropriation Bill.

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

      CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF AD HOC JOINT COMMITTEE ON REPARATIONS

Ms N C KONDLO: Mr Chairperson and hon members, this Committee, after  having
been established by the decision of the Chairperson  of  the  NCOP  and  the
Speaker   of   the   National   Assembly,   considered    the    President's
recommendations to Parliament. The TRC process, as we all know, was  a  very
painful process that opened wounds  and  reminded  many  of  the  atrocities
perpetrated against blacks in general and Africans  in  particular,  by  the
then apartheid regime. Many a times those who suffered most from these  acts
of gross human rights violations were and remain women.

Andingeze,   Mhlalingaphambili,   ndiwulibale   umbono    wendlela    oomama
baseGuguletu apha eKapa abawufumana ngawo umphanga  wokusweleka  kwabantwana
babo.  Sokhumbula  ukuba  bababona  ezindabeni  koomabonakude.  Abo  ngumama
kaMthimkhulu nomama kaSizwe  Kondile.  (Translation  of  isiXhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[Ms N C KONDLO: Chairperson, I could never forget the sight of  the  mothers
of the Gugulethu Seven when they heard the news about  the  death  of  their
sons. We will remember that they only saw and heard about them  during  news
time on TV. Those are Mthimkhulu's mother and Sizwe Kondile's mother.]

Chairperson, I will not venture into  citing  all  the  experiences  because
they are as many as the years we were discriminated against and  treated  as
less human by the then Strydom, Botha, Malan and De Klerk regimes.

Nangona kunjalo, Mhlalingaphambili, ... [Notwithstanding that,  Chairperson,
... ]

... when the ANC took over political power in 1994 ...

... yabona kubalulekile okokuba, njengoko uMqulu  weNkululeko  usithi  `kuya
kubakho uxolo  nokhuseleko',  mayimisele  umthetho  oza  kujongana  nokuzama
ukwakha  uxolo,  umanyano  nothando  phakathi  kwabemi  baseMzantsi  Afrika.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[... and saw it necessary to pass a law that seeks  to  build  peace,  unity
and love amongst the citizens of South Africa and also  a  way  of  bringing
about what the Freedom Charter says: There shall be peace and security.]

Yes,  Chairperson,  we  saw  how  victims  forgave  perpetrators.  We   also
witnessed situations where perpetrators  were  asking  for  forgiveness.  We
also know, I am sure the IFP will agree, that there  were  those  who  never
bothered to come forward to the TRC.

Healing  is  a  process.  After  it  has  been  established,  the  committee
considered the President's recommendations flowing from those  of  the  TRC.
After deliberating extensively on these  recommendations,  as  contained  in
the report before us, the committee endorsed these recommendations. The  ANC
believes that no amount of money ...

...  engaze  ibuyise  abo   abangasekhoyo,   ibuyekeze   ukungcungcuthekiswa
nomonzakalo kwabo bafunyaniswa  yikomishoni  bengamaxhoba  empatho  erhabaxa
ngokwamalungelo abo, ndawonye nazo  zonke  izinto  eziphathelee  nokuphathwa
gadalala kwabo.

Njengoko ikomiti ivumelene, ezi ziphakamiso zindidi  mbini:  zezo  zijongene
noluntu olwalungamaxhoba nezo zijongene  nabantu  abangamaxhoba  njengeziqu.
Sihlalo, zibe khona iindawo apho kusilele khona. I-ANC ithi ke  uRhulumente,
ngokwamasebe   ngamasebe,   makaqinise   ngakumbi,   agxininise   kwiinkqubo
ezijongene namaxhoba njengoko kwakuvunyelwene. Nathi,  njengabameli  babantu
eMzantsi Afrika, masizifumane iingxelo kumasebe  kuba  umthetho  uyasivumela
okokuba senze oko.

Apha,  Mhlalingaphambili,  sithetha  ngobom  babantu.  Ikhona  ke   imibutho
yezopolitiko  eyenza  into  yokudlala   ngobom   babantu.   Njengoko   isele
isisiqhelo kuyo, yenza loo nto nangoku, siyazi okokuba  ayizi  kuyamkela  le
ngxelo  yezi  ziphakamiso  zikaMongameli.  Sithi  siyi-ANC  siyazamkela  ezi
ziphakamiso nale Ndlu mayenze  njalo,  khon'  ukuze  lo  mcimbi  wembuyekezo
ukwazi ukwenzeka ngokukhawuleza. Sele lilide ngokwaneleyo ithuba.

Ilulutho ke kuthi, njengombutho wesizwe,  into  yokuba  ezi  ziNdlu  zoWiso-
mthetho zombini zibe ziyiqukumbele yonke le ngxelo  ziyamkele  ngale  nyanga
yolutsha,  kuba  loo  nto  ithetha  ukuthi  iza  kuthabatha  umgama  omkhulu
ekuzipholiseni izilonda kulutsha njengoko bachaphazeleka kakhulu  lulwamvila
lengcinezelo. Mhlalingaphambili, i-ANC iyayixhasa  le  ngxelo.  (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[... could bring back  the  dead;  reverse  the  experiences  of  abuse  and
assault and injuries suffered by those  that  the  commission  found  to  be
victims of oppression as well as  every  other  aspect  of  their  condition
under the apartheid regime.

As the committee has agreed, the proposal is two-fold: it is those that  are
concerned  with  the  people  that  are  victims  in  the  physical  manner.
Chairperson, indeed there are shortcomings in other  respects.  The  ANC  is
calling on the Government and the different departments,  to  emphasise  the
importance of programmes that are aimed at reparation  for  the  victims  as
per agreement. As representatives of the people of South Africa,  we  should
receive reports from different departments because we have  the  backing  of
the legislation.

Chairperson, here, we are talking about people's lives. We know  that  there
are political parties that do not acknowledge  people's  lives  at  all.  As
they have always been doing that and therefore are used to it, we know  that
they are not going  to  accept  the  President's  recommendations.  The  ANC
endorses these recommendations and this House should do  the  same  so  that
the matter about reparations should be resolved as soon as possible. It  has
been a long time already.

As the majority party, it would be significant  to  us  if  the  two  Houses
would conclude about this report and support  it  during  this  youth  month
because that would mean that it has taken  a  long  stride  in  healing  the
gaping wounds as the youth  sweat  and  bled  during  the  struggle  against
apartheid. Chairperson, the ANC supports this report.]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, the Democratic Alliance would like the  issue  of
reparations to be dealt with differently. We do  not  believe  a  `one  size
fits all' approach is either desirable or appropriate when dealing with  the
issue of reparations.

We put our position to the Ad Hoc Joint Committee  on  Reparations  and  the
majority of the committee members did not accept our point of view.  The  DA
is grateful that our positions were recorded in the report even though  they
were not identified as ours and they were not accepted.

The  DA  accepts  that  communities  suffered  and  were  traumatised  under
apartheid.  We  accept  that  there  is  a  need   to   rehabilitate   these
communities. The DA believes that  this  form  of  community  rehabilitation
should be in addition to proper  and  adequate  compensation  to  individual
``victims''.

The DA believes that, at the very least, the 2 975  declared  victims  whose
rights to claim civil damages against  successful  amnesty  applicants  were
extinguished, should have their losses  and  damages  assessed  and  receive
commensurate compensation. The DA believes that a once-off grant of R30  000
to the victims as defined in the Act to be inadequate.

The DA supports the recommendation that monuments be  erected  commemorating
the struggle for freedom and our new democracy. The DA believes  that  these
monuments should be symbols  of  unity  and  reconciliation  and  that  such
monuments should reflect these ideals.

As I have already stated, communities traumatised under apartheid should  be
rehabilitated, but that this should be in addition  to  adequate  individual
reparations. The DA also supports the  proposals  for  medical,  educational
and other social benefits.

It is important to note that there are a number of victims who have  ongoing
needs and who still suffer pain and trauma as a result  of  their  injuries.
The social benefits being offered will not fully address their needs,  which
resulted from the harm they suffered.

It is for these reasons that the DA cannot  support  this  report.  I  thank
you. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP:  Hon  members,  before  I  call  on  the  next
speaker, I must indicate that I allow the list to continue as  presented  to
me by the Whips,  despite  my  earlier  comment  with  respect  to  the  hon
Matthee.  I  will  deal  from  the  Chair  with  the  matter  of  the  party
representation of the hon members that I had referred  to  earlier.  But,  I
will allow the speakers' list to proceed as it is before me  at  this  time.
At our next sitting I will indicate the legal position.

Mnr F ADAMS: Voorsitter,  die  verslag  soos  hy  is  en  deur  die  komitee
opgestel, is aanvaarbaar. Daar is geen beswaar vanaf die Nuwe NP om  dit  te
ondersteun en te aanvaar nie. Voorts sal ons graag wou sien dat  die  bedrag
soos  voorgestel  deur  die   komitee,   nader   aan   die   Waarheids-   en
Versoeningskommissie se aanbeveling moes wees.

Desnieteenstaande wag die aansoekers vir hierdie uitbetaling daar buite  vir
die ontvangs daarvan. In die lig van die afwagting van die  aansoekers  word
daar vertrou dat die nodige regulasies so spoedig  moontlik  in  gestel  sal
word, om sodoende 'n deel van die geskiedenis van die verlede af te handel.

Ek wil ook graag die medevoorsitter, me N Kondlo, en die  kollegas  van  die
komitee bedank vir hul bydrae en harde werk in dié verband, Voorsitter.  Die
Nuwe NP steun die verslag. [Applous.] Ek dank u. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
speech follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: Chairperson, the report as it is and as it was drafted  by  the
committee is acceptable. There are no objections from the New NP to  support
and accept it. Furthermore,  we  would  like  to  see  that  the  amount  as
proposed by the committee should be closer to the Truth  and  Reconciliation
Commission's proposal.

Notwithstanding that the applicants of  this  pay-out  are  waiting  on  the
receipt thereof. In the light of the expectation of the  applicants,  it  is
trusted that the necessary  regulations  will  be  implemented  as  soon  as
possible in order to get closure on a part of the history of the past.

I would also like  to  thank  the  co-chairperson,  Ms  N  Kondlo,  and  the
colleagues of the committee for their contributions and hard  work  in  this
regard.

The New NP supports the report. [Applause.] I thank you.]
Mr M J BHENGU: Thank you, Chairperson. The  Act  that  established  the  TRC
provide that victims would lose  their  right  to  take  criminal  or  civil
action against perpetrators  who  applied  for  and  received  amnesty.  Our
committee  on  reparations  recommended  that  we  support  the  President's
recommendations calling for systematic programmes to project  the  symbolism
of the struggle and the  idea  of  freedom  through  academic  and  informal
records of history, cultural and art forms, erecting symbols  and  monuments
that exalt the freedom struggle, including new geographic and place names.

The  Committee  further  supported  the  Government's  commitment   to   the
continued system of special emphasis on the  rehabilitation  of  communities
that were subjected to intense acts of violence  and  destruction.  However,
it must be remembered, Chairperson, that millions of  people,  who  suffered
under apartheid, never appeared before the TRC.

Only about 19 000 people actually appeared before the TRC. Another  question
here is: How do we deal with the nonmonetary issues? It is  not  known  what
provision will be made to ensure that  the  destitute,  often  the  elderly,
sometimes rural people in remote parts of the country, who are  unlikely  to
have access to banks or bank accounts, would  safely  receive  the  proposed
lump sum of R30 000. So because of all these things, the  IFP  would  favour
broad-based communal and symbolic reparations. Secondly,  we  would  support
the institution of a basic income  grant,  presented  as  part  of  communal
reparations. And we believe  that  this  would  actually  really  impact  on
poverty and on nation-building. With those few words  Chairperson,  I  thank
you.

Rev M CHABAKU: Honourable Chair. I stand here as someone  who  has  been  in
touch with people that made presentations at the TRC  and  others  who  have
suffered through the  apartheid  system.  But  I  would  like  also  to  add
something: Many of our people's suffering did not start with  the  apartheid
system. The British started with all the oppression  in  our  country.  They
started the Land Act, they brought the pass issue, they  brought  the  Group
Areas Act. All these became the foundation on  which  the  apartheid  system
was built.

So I would urge that we must never forget that pain,  that  foundation  that
was just the basis for the apartheid system onwards. So the  TRC,  while  it
did a marvelous job of trying to give a record of  what  a  pain  and  agony
people have gone through, it has not said that it is authoritative,  or  the
only thing. And we have never ever anywhere, said  ``one  size  fits  all'';
never. So its a fabrication that comes from somewhere. The  committee  never
said so, never agreed that way, and the ANC, of course has  never  said  so.
The ANC knows that no money whatsoever can ever compensate for the  pain  or
hurt of anybody, anywhere, anytime. [Applause.]

Even the little money that the ANC has suggested of R30 000  per  family  or
person is not adequate, but where will we get all the money  for  everybody?
We would not but this is a gesture of showing our concern. And we have  also
said, on top of that, that we must also begin to be part  of  healing,  part
of reconciling, of bringing people together. There are many other ways  that
we can help to heal. The scars will always  be  there.  And  we  must  never
forget the scars, because otherwise you will forget who you  are  and  where
you come from.

Hence we suggest that the programmes that  we  have  already  started  as  a
healing nation, as a party that believes in reconciliation,  the  programmes
such as having the garden of  rememberance,  must  continue.  That  we  must
continue  building  monuments,   name   schools,   colleges,   institutions,
organisations  and  programmes  after  the  people   who   have   sacrificed
themselves to make us to be what we are. We must never forget  them  and  so
their memory will go on. And when we have those monuments, they are not  the
monuments of drunkenness in taverns, but they will  be  very  sad  monuments
because people lost their lives. They lost their relatives  and  some  don't
have even gravestones of where their loved ones have been. [Interjections.]

Some don't even know up to this day or have hardly even a  garment  to  show
where their loved ones were. The pain will always be there. But  because  we
are truly African, truly religious people who won't forget but can  forgive.
We are saying: let's come together. We have all been part  of  the  problem.
Let's be part of the answer. We are urging that all of us must support  this
report of the President who said: `` Let  us  find  ways  in  which  we  can
compensate and also make sure that such violence must never happen  again''.
We must commit ourselves that we will love people beyond race or colour.  We
will share and care for them beyond race and  colour.  Those  who  have  the
means must always share with those who don't have them.  Because  if  we  do
not do so, tomorrow you will  lose  what  you  have,  if  you  don't  share.
[Applause.]

So we are saying here as a nation, we have shown the world through  the  TRC
that we have created a place where  those  who  have  committed  crime,  can
share; and those who were forced to commit crime and were used by  can  also
come and share and bear their souls.

For others it was a job issue. It was not that they  believed  in  what  was
happening. So they are also human beings.  So  we  must  find  the  healing,
reconciling for them. So this report  really  endorses  what  the  President
stands for. And we urge that it must not just be a report, it  must  be  our
own commitment that from today the TRC thing must never happen again.

But we take that record, see what we have and  that  it  must  not  multiply
again. We become committed to caring and  sharing  with  people  everywhere,
because many people are in need but a lot of people have got a lot of  greed
and so continue to push the greed, the need  will  never  be  met.  So  this
report is a very worthwhile report. I was privileged to be in the  committee
and the subcommittee to hear and learn and understand how different  parties
were trying to work together. The different parties were trying to make  one
resolution, so that this decision is a decision of support and  co-operation
of all parties for all people, of one nation, in the New South Africa.

And we say this and we make this report on this special day, that is  on  26
June. Remember, I say my brothers and sisters, my colleagues, that  the  TRC
will not answer the whole question. But it's a record of  showing  what  has
been done and this was presented to us. Copies of report are available.  The
President has gone through it and has made his recommendations. In  response
to what my honourable friend Mr  Lever  was  saying:  If  you  remove  those
phrases, all the rest was what we decided on, except that we didn't  mention
about this being ``one size fits all'', as he said.

Even the R30 000 is merely a gesture of compensation. We know 22 000  people
came forward and some 19 000 cases were recommended for  urgent  reparation.
Reparation means putting what was damaged and made wrong during war. So  the
urgency is there. There are many who didn't come to the hearing.  There  are
many who died. There are many who didn't report and  who  are  suffering  in
silence. There are many who are cripple right now. So we can't be able  heal
everyone of them. But let's say how can we make this hurt to be part of  the
answer. How can we turn lemons into lemonade? How can we make these men  and
women who have pain and hurt, use it positively to  build,  to  restructure,
to reconcile, to make a new country. The world is watching us and we are  an
example. We must continue to be an example.

With these words I say: Let's  move  this  report  and  serve  this  report.
[Applause].

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: I shall now  put  the  question,  the  question
being that the report should be adopted. The decison is dealt with in  terms
of section 75 of the Constitution. I note  that  all  delegation  heads  are
present in the House. In accordance with rule 7 I shall allow  provinces  an
opportunity to make their declarations of vote, if they wish to  do  so.  Is
there any province wishing to do so? There is none. We proceed therefore  to
voting on the question. This will be  done  in  the  usual  way.  Delegation
heads should indicate whether they vote in favour, against or  abstain  from
voting.
