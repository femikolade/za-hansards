                             PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS

               (Resumption of Debate on Subject for Discussion

Mr J H VAN DER MERWE: That's a nice dress!

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Thank you. That's why I was missing you, Koos!

In his state of the nation address, the President said:
  In the implementation  of  our  programmes  we  need  to  pay  particular
  attention to culture, music and the arts as manifestations of  our  self-
  image as a nation ... As a contribution to building the  self-image  that
  attaches to a proud nation, we shall continue this year with the  project
  to build the first phase of the Freedom Park Monument.

In his budget speech in May 2002 Minister  Ngubane,  in  talking  about  the
Freedom Park project, had this to say:


  Freedom Park will be a monument to our collective  struggle  for  dignity
  and human rights. These structures will celebrate the  rich  tapestry  of
  our lives from the earliest times as the cradle of humankind, through the
  stone and iron ages and the agrarian era, to the  ages  of  conflict  and
  colonisation, the struggle for democracy, and the present ...

I will come back to the Freedom Park.

Let me first start my speech by stating the obvious. Culture is to the  soul
and psyche of a human being as important as the air we breathe in is to  the
survival of our physical beings. Culture, our values,  traditions,  customs,
the expression of our sensibilities born of  our  environment  and  heritage
through art forms like  music,  drama,  creative  writing,  film,  arts  and
crafts etc, all these put together are an essential part of the identity  of
any group of people and the  individuals  within  these  groups.  The  self-
images we carry through our lives are informed by our cultural heritage  and
the status accorded our cultures in the everyday business of  our  families,
communities, nations and even the international forums.

Recognition of this is attested to by the existence  of  bodies,  activities
and debates to promote human dialogue on  these  matters.  After  all,  wars
have been known to take many lives over issues like language,  an  important
part of culture. One such forum is the International  Network  for  Cultural
Policy, one of whose meetings was hosted by South Africa here in  Cape  Town
from 13 to 16 October 2002. In  the  face  of  both  the  opportunities  and
challenges of a globalising world, nations have to find answers  to  matters
such as the overwhelming or even drowning of domestic cultural  products  by
foreign products from the developed nations,  especially  from  America.  At
this forum, there seemed to be  agreement  that  there  is  a  need  for  an
international instrument on cultural diversity to preserve and  promote  all
cultures for the continued enrichment  of  the  human  experience.  Such  an
instrument, we hope, would intervene positively for previously  marginalised
cultures in a world that continues to experience what President Mbeki  calls
``global apartheid''.

At the opening of the fifth annual INCP meeting  of  Ministers  of  Culture,
Minister Ngubane played the music of  one  of  the  most  talented  but  not
adequately  recognised  musicians  of  our  country.  Her  name  is   Latozi
Mphahlele, popularly  known  as  Madosini.  She  plays  uhadi,  umrhube  and
isitolotolo in a  manner  that  words  cannot  describe,  only  the  endless
whisper of the soul will affirm. I had the occasion to search for her CD  at
the end of last year. It was the most difficult and frustrating  experience,
as some of the music shops in Cape Town and Johannesburg knew about her  but
did not have her music as she is not regarded as popular. For them, what  is
important is to sell and make money, not to promote the authentic  music  of
a rural woman who is hardly known by the so-called modern world.

This is why it is important that we  put  these  matters  up  for  conscious
deliberation as we are the people charged with the responsibility  to  build
this South African nation. If we are to  evolve  a  common  self-image  that
attaches to a proud nation, as the President asked us to  do,  we  must  pay
special attention to a number of elements and issues  that  are  our  legacy
and cry out for attention.

Deliberate steps have to be  taken  by  the  state  to  sensitively  channel
resources and efforts towards the creation of an atmosphere and  environment
in which, in the sphere of culture, there can be a  healing  of  old  wounds
and the flourishing  of  talent  among  all  communities  of  this  country,
especially in the ranks of our youth who will inherit the future.

This approach calls on us to  be  bold  and  to  acknowledge  that  it  will
liberate both the formerly oppressed and the former oppressor. It is a  win-
win situation from which our society can only emerge stronger.  By  this,  I
must not be understood to be  advocating  a  rushed  melting-pot-of-cultures
approach. I am talking about the need  to  liberate  ourselves  collectively
from the notion that there are  inferior  cultures  and  superior  cultures.
This kind of approach is what leads to prejudices, discrimination,  backward
ethnicity, racism and xenophobia. We will remember that we hosted the  whole
world in a major effort to rid humanity of these persisting ills among us.

Harmony among human beings can be  enhanced  by  each  person  feeling  that
their identity has acceptance, respect and space for expression  within  the
reasonable possibilities and boundaries of co-existence  with  other  fellow
humans who might come from a different cultural background. A  mature  give-
and-take attitude is necessary from all sides. For instance, if the  hon  Ms
Taljaard were to be married to my son ... [Laughter]  [Applause]  ...  as  I
hope she might consider doing, I would expect that when I visit  them  -  Mr
and Mrs Mbete - I would sometimes be treated to mngqusho  [samp  and  beans]
and the music of Madosini; other times to her type  of  music  and  cuisine.
[Laughter.]

At the state level, of course, bearing in mind imbalances we inherited  from
the past, we must allocate the  necessary  resources  to  level  the  fields
where cultural expression must flourish in our democracy. We can now say  we
are  fortunate  that  we  had  the  presence  of  mind  to  create  in   our
Constitution the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of  the  Rights
of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities. We passed  the  necessary
law last  year,  as  hon  members  will  remember,  and,  in  December,  the
President determined that  there  will  be  17  commission  members.  It  is
proposed by the Department of  Provincial  and  Local  Government  that  the
commission be established from July this year, and that the  first  national
consultative conference be convened in 2004.

This is an important institution to help us manage and process  a  range  of
challenges thrown up in our communities, bound by  the  commitment  to  move
forward always in the  areas  of  culture,  religion  and  language.  We  as
members  of  Parliament  have  the  duty  to  explain  these   matters   and
participate in the local debates that translate legal  measures  like  these
and policy into tools to improve daily lives, and  provide  answers  to  any
anxieties and fears that might exist among the citizens.

As a country, we must commend ourselves for the strides made  by  Government
in terms of  the  Language  Policy  Framework,  especially  in  relation  to
education and the Public Service among others. The need for  sensitivity  in
matters of language cannot be overemphasised. In the debate  in  March  2002
on  the  commission  mentioned  earlier,  the  hon  Grobbler  captured   the
situation well when he said:
  Afrikaans has a constitutional right as does Zulu, Xhosa or  English  ...
  My duty as an Afrikaans speaker is to behave in such a way towards  those
  who speak other languages that I earn respect and in doing so nurture  an
  attitude which aims to help build a proud South African nation  with  the
  diversity of our people in this country.

This quotation captures  the  spirit  provided  for  in  section  6  of  the
Constitution.

It is therefore extremely disappointing to come across incidents  like  what
happened in The  Desmond  Dube  Show  two  weeks  ago.  This  is  the  first
opportunity, as this Parliament,  that  we  are  able  to  comment  on  this
unfortunate matter.

Kuthiwa uDesmond Dube, kuloluya hlelo lwakhe lwamahlaya, wakhuluma  ngabantu
abakhuluma  isiTsonga  njengabantu  abangaphansi  kwezimfene.   Wathi   yena
kungangcono abe yimfene kunokuthi abe ngumuntu okhuluma isiTsonga.

Sithi-ke, siyileli Phalamende, ingqondo nokucabanga  okunjalo  akuvumelekile
kuleli zwe lakithi, ikakhulu izwe esililwele ngale ndlela esililwele  ngayo,
ngendlela futhi uMthethosisekelo  wethu  othi  singaze  siphinde  siphindele
kuleliya lizwe esiqhamuka kulona. Kufuneka  njalo  sakhe  iNingizimu  Afrika
ehloniphayo   lapho   abantu   behloniphana   khona   ngezilimi    ngezilimi
abazikhulumayo ezehlukene. (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[It is said that Desmond Dube, in  his  comic  programme,  referred  to  the
Tsonga-speaking people as people who are even inferior to baboons.  He  said
that he would rather be a baboon than a Tsonga-speaking person.

We as Parliament say that such an idea and thinking should not be  prevalent
in this country of ours, especially in a country that we have fought for  so
hard and a country where our Constitution says we should not return  to  the
old South Africa, the past which we come from.  We  should  always  build  a
respectful South Africa, where people respect one another regardless of  the
languages they speak.]

It is not enough that we hear that Desmond  Dube  apologised  in  print,  on
radio and on TV. That is inadequate. The SABC, as  a  national  broadcaster,
ought to take, and come out very clearly on, a position that  condemns  this
kind of behaviour from one of its employees. [Applause.] I  must  report  to
this House that we, in my office, have tried without  success  to  find  out
from the SABC what their position is  on  such  behaviour  by  an  employee,
because to say that he has apologised is really to duck the  issue.  We  are
busy here very delicately putting together a nation.  If  somebody  employed
by a national broadcaster behaves like this, it  is  our  responsibility  to
take a position and say that this shall not be tolerated, and to say how  we
are going to deal with such behaviour if anybody  else  does  this,  in  the
future. Hopefully, we are still going to hear what the position of the  SABC
is on such behaviour.

I must take this opportunity to point out that  Parliament  is  also  making
progress towards adopting a language policy before the  end  of  this  year,
which is the year before our next election. I remind all  political  parties
in the House that the deadline for their submissions on this was  yesterday.
I hope that all parties have submitted their submissions. If  not,  we  must
point out that the latest we will accept submissions is this week,  so  that
this Parliament can  finally  take  a  position  and,  therefore,  the  next
Parliament can start its work after the elections on  a  better  basis  than
what we inherited.

I would now like to return to the issue of the Freedom  Park  Monument,  and
what it stands for. Hon members will remember that  I  quoted  the  hon  the
Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology on  the  occasion  of  his
budget speech in 2002 when he explained to us how we should  understand  the
Freedom Park project. The importance of this project  is  such  that  it  is
being planned that the tenth anniversary of our democracy  is  going  to  be
celebrated  at  the  structures  of  the  Freedom  Park,  which  are   under
construction this year.

We would like to urge members of Parliament to realise that they and we  all
have a duty to popularise the  Freedom  Park  project,  and  to  debate  the
history that we come from, which is being celebrated by  that  project,  and
to discover more and more from our communities what we stand  for,  and  the
cultural wealth that is among our people.

I would like, in ending, to quote from the speech of the President  when  he
launched the Freedom Park project on 16 June 2002:


  The Freedom Park seeks to recapture, as far as possible, the legends  and
  the rich traditions, both written and unwritten, so that we, as Africans,
  begin to be visible. We want to  do  this  so  that  when  the  invisible
  African in Ben Okri's book looks  for  himself  in  his  people,  he  can
  discover that, in fact, he does exist.


  Through projects such as Freedom Park, we are able to ensure  that  other
  people who pretended that they don't see the African people, or  even  if
  they see them they accorded an inferior status to us, we  will  begin  to
  remove cobweb after cobweb of their prejudices such that they  begin  not
  only to see  and  recognise  our  existence,  but  that  they  themselves
  appreciate the fact that they are  descendants  of  human  ancestors  who
  emerged and evolved from a common origin, the African continent.


   The Freedom Park will also relate the history of our recent  past.  This
  includes the manner in which indigenous people lost their land, livestock
  and freedom under both Dutch and British colonialism. We will record  the
  heroic resistance of the native people of South Africa.


  Further, we  will  ensure  that  we  present  the  true  story  that  has
  characterised the struggle of our people for freedom, especially  in  the
  20th century. We will celebrate Bhambatha,  the  struggles  around  land,
  workers' struggles  and  different  stages  of  union  organisation,  the
  various phases of mass mobilisation -  peaceful  petitions,  deputations,
  peaceful  protests,  passive  resistance,  defiance  campaigns  to  armed
  resistance - all these will be important parts of Freedom Park.


  The Freedom Park will recognise the significant role played by  different
  sectors of our society. We have  already  referred  to  the  workers.  In
  addition, we will celebrate the important contributions  made  by  women,
  youth, rural people and others.


  Together, through Freedom Park, we  will  acknowledge  the  central  role
  played by the South Africans from different parties to  ensure  that  our
  country becomes free and democratic. This includes during the  course  of
  the struggle as well as during the negotiations  for  the  new  political
  order.


  Freedom Park should therefore make  us  walk  the  entire  South  African
  history. When we have done this, we should then appreciate  our  country,
  its people, their diversity and their determination  to  build  a  united
  nation with a common vision, aspirations and goals.


  The Freedom Park must help us to heal the divisions of the past, and work
  for  reconciliation.  As  we  all  agree,  real   healing   and   genuine
  reconciliation will only come about when we have told the entire story of
  why we became antagonists in the first place. It is on this basis that we
  should not, in trying to deal with the divisions of the past, sweep  some
  matters under the carpet.

[Applause.]

Dr J T DELPORT:  Madam  Speaker,  after  having  listened  to  the  previous
speaker I am looking at her with new eyes, politically speaking, of course.

Gister het die agb dr Geldenhuys in 'n grap verwys daarna dat  'n  mens  nie
op jou sterfbed met die duiwel vyande maak nie. Dit is klaarblyklik  dat  sy
leier, mnr Van Schalkwyk, hierdie woorde op sy politieke sterfbed  letterlik
opgeneem het.

Marthinus van Schalkwyk en sy wapendraer die agb  Renier  Schoeman  het  van
eerbare politici soos dr  Boy  Geldenhuys  en  andere  politieke  agterryers
gemaak. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daarmee het hy die naam Nuwe  NP  finaal  van  die
politieke telbord verwyder. Dit  is  oor!  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Eerder  as  om
agterryers van die ANC te wees moet Nuwe NP-lede dan liewer  direk  die  ANC
steun. Daar is diegene wat dit wel sal doen op grond van die breë,  redelike
ekonomiese beleid van die Regering. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Sulke persone moet egter dan weet, soos daardie agb lid, dat hulle  dan  ook
hulle seën uitspreek, onder meer,  oor  die  onwilligheid  van  die  ANC  om
korrupsie uit te roei, die patetiese toestand  van  die  landsadministrasie,
die feit dat oorlog in Irak vir die agb  President  belangriker  is  as  die
oorlog teen moordenaars, rowers en verkragters, en  teen  HIV/vigs,  en  dat
hulle hul seën uitspreek oor  die  afskaffing  van  die  kommando's  om  die
platteland totaal te ontwapen.

Waar is dan 'n tuiste vir die voormalige Nuwe NP-ondersteuners, waarvan  die
grootste gros Afrikaans is? Oor die algemeen is daar 'n matelose gevoel  van
marginalisering by meestal wit landsburgers,  en  baie  bruin  kiesers  deel
hierdie gevoel. Desperaat word gesoek na 'n  nuwe  visie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]
Dit het 'n kreet laat opgaan dat Afrikaners politiek moet verenig,  en  daar
is baie partye, en hulle word elke dag meer, wat  hierdie  vlag  dra.  Hulle
wil  verenig  teen  die  bedreiging  van  Afrikaanse   taal-   kultuur-   en
onderwysbelange. Hulle wil veg vir Afrikaners.

Natuurlik is daar rede vir diepe  ontsteltenis.  Die  belangrikste  rede  is
naamlik dat die ANC-regering gewoon nie die erkenning  van  die  diversiteit
van ons mense in Suid-Afrika tot volle ontplooiing  laat  kom  nie.  Kortom,
die ANC misken sekere beginsels wat in die Grondwet vervat is.  Dit  is  so,
maar die pad is nie Afrikaner-mobilisasie nie. Dit is  die  mobilisasie  van
alle kiesers wat die beginsels deel waarop 'n gelukkige  toekoms  gebou  kan
word.

Daarom nooi die DA u, ook diegene wat nou in die Nuwe NP sit, om te  kom  en
'n rol in die DA te speel. Kom gee stukrag aan die koers van  die  DA,  want
die DA gaan op sy beurt 'n  rigtinggewende  rol  speel  in  'n  nuwe,  breër
koalisie. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daardie breër koalisie gaan  die  nuwe  regering
van Suid-Afrika word. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Laat ek reguit praat  met  almal  wat  hulle  soos  ek  'n  Afrikaner  noem:
Afrikaners is nie 'n Godverkore volk wat ter wille van homself moet  bestaan
nie. Afrikaners bestaan om bo eiebelang uit te styg om  rigting  en  stukrag
aan die gang van die toekoms in  hierdie  land  te  gee  saam  met  so  baie
andere, en om stukrag te gee  aan  'n  politieke  beweging  wat  Suid-Afrika
werklik sal regeer ten beswil van al die mense; 'n  regering  met  'n  beter
visie en 'n beter plan.

Ons het 'n regering nodig in Suid-Afrika  wat  eens  en  vir  altyd  misdaad
genadeloos sal uitroei;  wat  vir  die  armes  sal  omgee,  nie  alleen  met
lippediens nie; wat moedertaalonderwys - en ek  herhaal,  moedertaalonderwys
- sal aanbied vir dié wat dit vra en wat  ons  opvoedkundige  inrigtings  en
navorsingseenhede  weer  sentrums  van  uitnemendheid  sal  maak;  wat   die
geldmors, korrupsie en wanadministrasie wat hoogty vier,  sal  stopsit;  wat
sport sal wegvat van sekere mense en dit teruggee  aan  die  sportlui  self;
wat ons talentvolle jeug wat in  moedeloosheid  en  radeloosheid  elders  'n
heenkome gaan soek, sal terugbring na hulle vaderland. [Tussenwerpsels.]

So 'n regering is binne bereik van 'n koalisie tussen die DA en die  IVP  en
andere, en ek loof by hierdie geleentheid die leiding wat kom van die  leier
van die IVP, die agb Minister Buthelezi. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is ons  visie
en strewe in die DA. Dit is die pad wat ons gaan loop, of die agb  lede  aan
daardie kant van die Raad daarvan hou of nie. Dit is  wat  die  kiesers  van
Suid-Afrika gaan vra  en  dit  is  wat  die  kiesers  uiteindelik  kan  kry.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Daarom nooi ons u almal: kom word deel van hierdie visie  en  hierdie  beter
plan vir Suid-Afrika. [Tussenwerpsels.] Aan almal wat vra waar  hulle  visie
is, waar hul pad is  en  wat  die  toekoms  inhou,  het  ek  net  'n  enkele
boodskap: daar ís 'n pad. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit is 'n moeilike pad,  dit  is
'n harde pad, maar daar is 'n pad vir elkeen in hierdie land,  ook  vir  die
Afrikaner. [Tussenwerpsels.] Wanneer  ons  aanstons  gaan  begin  praat  oor
verkiesings, dan is die boodskap wat ek graag wil  uitstuur  in  die  woorde
van Watermeyer, wat gesê het:


  Hand, hand wat kruisie maak,
  Is hand wat aan die toekoms raak.

Laat ons ons toekoms met ons hand aanraak. Dankie.  [Applous.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Yesterday the hon Dr Geldenhuys jokingly referred  to  the  fact  that  one
does not make an enemy of the devil on one's deathbed. It is  apparent  that
his leader, Mr Van Schalkwyk, took these words literally  on  his  political
deathbed.

Marthinus van Schalkwyk and his  armour-bearer,  the  hon  Renier  Schoeman,
have made political hangers-on of honourable  politicians  such  as  Dr  Boy
Geldenhuys and others. [Interjections.] With that  he  has  finally  removed
the name of the  New  NP  from  the  political  scoreboard.  That  is  over!
[Interjections.] Rather than  being  ANC  hangers-on,  the  New  NP  members
should rather support the ANC directly. There are those who will do this  on
the basis of the  broader,  rational  economic  policy  of  the  Government.
[Interjections.]

Such persons, however, should also know, such as that hon member, that  they
are  then  also  expressing  their   blessing,   inter   alia,   about   the
unwillingness of the ANC to root out corruption, the pathetic state  of  the
public administration, the fact that the war in Iraq is  more  important  to
the hon President than the war against murderers, robbers and  rapists,  and
against HIV/Aids, and that they are  expressing  their  blessing  about  the
abolition of the commandos to totally disarm the rural areas.

Where, then, is a home for the  former  New  NP  supporters,  of  which  the
greater majority is Afrikaans? In general there is an unmeasured feeling  of
marginalisation by mainly white citizens, and  many  coloured  voters  share
this  feeling.  There  is   a   desperate   search   for   a   new   vision.
[Interjections.] This has culminated in  a  slogan  that  Afrikaners  should
unite politically, and there are many parties, and they are getting more  by
the day, who are carrying this flag. They want to unite against  the  threat
to the interests of the Afrikaans  language,  culture  and  education.  They
want to fight for Afrikaners.

There is, of course, reason for this deep dismay. The most important  reason
is  namely  that  the  ANC   Government   usually   does   not   allow   the
acknowledgement of the diversity of our people in South Africa  to  come  to
its full development. In short, the ANC disregards certain principles  which
are contained in  the  Constitution.  This  is  so,  but  the  road  is  not
Afrikaner mobilisation. It is the mobilisation of all voters who  share  the
principles on which a happy future can be built.
For this reason the DA invites you, as well as those who are now sitting  in
the New NP, to come and play a role in the DA. Come  and  give  momentum  to
the direction of the DA, because the DA in its  turn  is  going  to  play  a
direction-giving role in the new, broader coalition.  [Interjections.]  That
broader coalition is going to become the new  Government  of  South  Africa.
[Interjections.]

Let me be frank  with  all  of  those  who,  like  myself,  call  themselves
Afrikaners: Afrikaners are not  a  chosen  people  who  have  to  exist  for
themselves only. Afrikaners exist to  rise  above  their  own  interests  in
order to give direction and momentum to the course of  the  future  in  this
country with so many others, and to give momentum to  a  political  movement
which is going to govern South Africa in  the  best  interests  of  all  its
people; a Government with a better vision and a better plan.

We need a government in South Africa that will stamp out  crime  mercilessly
once and for all; that will care for the poor, not only  with  lip  service;
that will present mother-tongue education  -  and  I  repeat,  mother-tongue
education - for those who ask for it, and that  will  once  again  make  our
educational institutions and  research  facilities  centres  of  excellence;
that  will  put  a  stop  to  the  squandering  of  money,  corruption   and
maladministration which is reigning supreme; that will take away sport  from
certain people and give it back to the sportspeople  themselves;  that  will
bring back to their motherland our talented youth who  have  gone  elsewhere
to look for a livelihood in desperation and despondency. [Interjections.]

Such a government is within the reach of the coalition between  the  DA  and
the IFP and others, and I take this opportunity  to  praise  the  leadership
coming  from  the  leader  of  the  IFP,   the   hon   Minister   Buthelezi.
[Interjections.] This is our vision and aim in the DA. This is the  road  we
are going to take, whether the hon members on that side of  the  House  like
it or not. This is what the voters of South Africa are going to ask for  and
what they are going to get eventually. [Interjections.]

For this reason we are inviting you all: come and be  part  of  this  vision
and a better plan for South Africa. [Interjections.] To all  those  who  are
asking where is our vision, where is our  road  and  what  does  the  future
hold, I have only one message: there is a road.  [Interjections.]  It  is  a
difficult road, it is a tough road, but there is  a  road  for  everyone  in
this country, including the Afrikaner. [Interjections.] When  we  are  going
to begin to talk about elections shortly, the message I would like  to  send
out is in the words of Watermeyer, who said:


  Hand, hand wat kruisie maak,
  Is hand wat aan die toekoms raak.

Let us touch our future with our hand. Thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, the  basic  theme  of
the President's state of the nation  address  was  the  call  to  all  South
Africans to unite in the fight to roll back the frontiers of poverty.

I hope that as we seek to achieve this noble objective, we are also able  to
roll back the frontiers of ignorance, unsubstantiated statements  and  anti-
South African politics that permeate the ranks of some  of  the  opposition.
[Interjections.]

The childish histrionics that we have been subjected  to  in  the  past  few
days call for a wind of change to blow away  historic  relics  that  falsely
continue to argue that nothing in South Africa has  changed  and  that,  for
many people, life is actually worse. I believe they  must  be  living  in  a
``Leonstaat'', oblivious to what is actually happening in our country.

Mr President, you identified the tremendous challenges confronting  us  and,
once  again,  critically  assessed  our  achievements  and  identified   our
problems. The facts, statistics and future political,  economic  and  social
programmes you announced clearly indicate that  we  are  a  winning  nation.
This is widely acknowledged by many in the world. It  is  also  acknowledged
by millions of honest South Africans, black and white. Only  our  right-wing
anti-South African  ideologues  -  mainly  on  the  DP  benches  -  fail  to
acknowledge this truth. We urge you, Mr President, to  stay  on  course  and
ignore them.

Mr President, you once again identified the  dialectical  link  between  our
domestic policy objectives and our foreign policy objectives. We live  in  a
globalised world, and our ability to consolidate our  democracy  and  ensure
that we become a prosperous nation, which improves the quality  of  life  of
all our people, is impacted on by many factors outside our own country.

Later today you will leave South Africa to attend the Franco-African  summit
in Paris, and then the Non-Aligned Movement summit  in  Kuala  Lumpur.  Both
these important summits  will  be  important  occasions  on  which  to  seek
support for Nepad and a peaceful world. We wish you a  good  and  successful
trip.

The cornerstone of our foreign policy will be to end  conflicts  peacefully,
to achieve a new world order that is more equitable and people-centred,  and
to create conditions for  sustainable  development.  This  demands  that  we
strengthen and not weaken multilateralism.

As you indicated, we seek to make the  21st  century  the  African  century.
This, therefore, demands that this should be a century of African peace  and
of world peace. Mr President, you said that we have  to  ``choose  sides  in
the contest between human hope and human despair, between war and peace  ...
Without peace we will fail in  the  effort  in  which  we  are  engaged,  to
transform ours into a country of hope, and revert to the past  on  which  we
have turned our backs, a past of misery and despair.''

The logic of this argument should be understandable to any normal  and  sane
person. However, true to tradition, the DP,  many  of  whom  pretend  to  be
rocket scientists, have once again exposed their  inability  or  refusal  to
understand such logic. More dangerously, they have once again tried to  turn
the debate into an anti-South African argument. [Interjections.]

I am concerned  that  they  have  dangerously  argued  that  our  seeking  a
peaceful solution to the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,  in  terms  of
the Security Council Resolution 1441, is anti-American. I begin to  question
what objectives the  DP  is  pursuing  by  constantly  spreading  the  false
allegation that we  are  anti-American.  They  must  answer  this  question.
[Interjections.]

The hon member Gibson is reported to have said that our mission to Iraq  was
``political tourism and cuddling up to  Saddam's  dictatorship''  and  that,
``as with Zimbabwe, the Government will start out  with  the  appearance  of
honest brokers before the mantle eventually slips  away  and  they  tell  us
that Iraq's Ba'th Party is an ally like Zanu-PF''.

The comments by the hon Leon were just as  ridiculous  and  embarrassing  as
that of Gibson. He calls for change in everything we are doing. Let me  tell
him that we will not have sleepless nights, because millions of  our  people
know that the changes he is calling for are changes that will take  us  back
to the pre-1994 days, and they will reject this call with  the  contempt  it
deserves. [Applause.] One wonders why we continue to be  subjected  in  this
Parliament to such childish, infantile disorder. [Interjections.]

Mr  President,  we  have  consistently  said  that  the  objective  of   our
interaction with the Iraqi government and  many  other  governments  in  the
world was to ensure  that  we  prevent  a  war  that  will  have  disastrous
consequences for world peace  and  stability  and  for  the  development  of
Africa.

An HON MEMBER: The war in ... [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: We called on  the  Iraqi  government
to  accept  and  fully   implement   Security   Council   Resolution   1441.
[Interjections.]
Why  don't  you   keep   quiet?   You're   making   a   noise.   [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

We urged the Iraqi government ... [Interjections.] This  infantile  disorder
never surprises me.

We urged the Iraqi government to co-operate fully with  the  UN  inspectors,
and we also urged them to respond satisfactorily to the  concerns  expressed
by the inspectors in their reports to the Security  Council  on  8  December
2002.

Much reference internationally has been made to the South African  model  of
disarmament as being the ideal model. During my last visit,  we  offered  to
share our experience in eradicating weapons  of  mass  destruction  in  Iraq
peacefully. The Iraqi government has accepted  our  offer,  and  a  team  of
South African experts will leave shortly for Iraq. [Interjections.]

During my visit  our  delegation  also  met  with  the  leaders  of  the  UN
inspectors, Dr Blix and ElBaradei, both of whom were highly appreciative  of
the South African efforts. [Interjections.] This view is shared by  many  in
the world.
If the prophets of distortion and stupidity on my left  cared  to  read  the
latest report of the inspectors to  the  Security  Council  on  14  February
2003, and if they followed the debate in the Security  Council,  they  would
have to honestly admit that much progress ...

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, would you please take your seat.

Prof B TUROK: Madam Speaker, may I respectfully ask you to  ask  the  Leader
of the Opposition not to interrupt the  whole  of  the  speech,  because  we
can't hear the speaker. There is a constant barrage from  there.  We  cannot
hear and also ...

The SPEAKER: Hon member, please take your seat. I  would  like  to  ask  ...
[Interjections.] Order! I would like to ask all members to please allow  the
speakers to be heard. We can understand one heckle, but this continuous  one
yesterday and today does not help the debate.

Please proceed, hon member.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Speaker, as I was  saying,  if
they listened to the debate and listened to the inspectors, they would  have
to honestly admit that much progress has been made. There  are,  of  course,
still outstanding issues to be resolved.  This  is  work  in  progress,  and
therefore the South African Government supports the call for the mandate  of
the inspectors to be extended so that they can successfully  complete  their
work.

Since some of the opposition are driven by the philosophy of ``we have  made
up our minds, so don't confuse us with the facts,'' let me give  this  House
some of the facts. Mr  Blix,  on  14  February,  reported  to  the  Security
Council that, amongst other things, the inspectors have continued  to  build
upon their  capabilities.  The  inspectors  have  conducted  more  than  400
inspections, covering more than 300 sites. These inspections were  performed
without notice and access was almost always provided promptly.

On the issue of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction  and  related  proscribed
items and programmes, so far Unmovic has not found any such weapons, only  a
small number of empty chemical munitions. However, many  proscribed  weapons
and items are  still  to  be  accounted  for.  Blix  went  on  to  say  that
significant outstanding issues of substance such as anthrax, nerve agent  VX
and long-range missiles would have to be resolved.

At a meeting in Baghdad on 8 and 9 February, when our  delegation  was  also
there,  Blix  said  that  the  Iraq  side  had  addressed   some   important
outstanding disarmament issues and gave the inspectors a  number  of  papers
relating to anthrax and growth material, the  nerve  agent  VX  and  missile
production. The presentation of the papers, according to Mr Blix,  could  be
indicative of a more active attitude, focusing on important open issues.

The inspectors were also given a list of 83 names of participants  ``in  the
unilateral destruction in the  chemical  field,  which  took  place  in  the
summer of 1991''.

``The list'', Blix  said,  ``appears  to  be  useful  and  pertains  to  co-
operation on substance.''

A commission which had  been  appointed  in  the  wake  of  the  inspectors'
finding 12 empty chemical weapon warheads has had its  mandate  expanded  to
look for any still existing proscribed items. A second  commission  has  now
been appointed with the task of searching all over Iraq for  more  documents
relevant to the elimination of proscribed items and  programmes.  The  Iraqi
side confirmed the commitment to  encourage  the  persons  asked  to  accept
private interviews whether in or out of Iraq.

He  reported  that  a  presidential  decree  had  been   issued   containing
prohibitions with regard to the importation and  production  of  biological,
chemical and nuclear weapons. He also reported that the Iraq government  had
agreed to the use of USA U-2 spy  planes,  French  Mirage  aircraft,  German
drones  and  a  Russian  Antonov  aircraft  to  help  the  capacity  of  the
inspectors.

On the same day, Mr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had conducted  a  total
of 177 inspections at 125 locations and that Iraq had continued  to  provide
immediate access to all locations. He said, ``Iraq has expanded the list  of
relevant Iraqi personnel to over 300.''  It  supplied  IAEA  with  documents
related to questions and concerns that had  been  raised  since  1998  which
needed further clarification.

He went on to say:


  The government of Iraq reiterated last week its commitment to comply with
  the Security Council obligations and  to  provide  full  and  active  co-
  operation with the  inspecting  organisations.  The  IAEA  concluded,  by
  December 1998, that it had neutralised Iraq's past nuclear programme  and
  that, therefore, there were no unresolved disarmament issues left.

The focus, since the resumption of the inspections in Iraq two  and  a  half
months ago, has been to verify whether Iraq revived  its  nuclear  programme
in the intervening years. He said:


  We have to date found  no  evidence  of  ongoing  prohibited  nuclear  or
  nuclear-related activities in Iraq. However, a number of issues are still
  under investigation and  we  are  not  yet  in  a  position  to  reach  a
  conclusion about them.


  My hope is that the commitments made recently in Baghdad will continue to
  translate into concrete and sustained action.

Through our activities, Mr President, South Africa will continue  to  ensure
that the Iraqi commitment will be translated  into  concrete  and  sustained
action. The debate in the Security Council,  which  starts  today,  and  the
emergency summit of the EU indicate the complexity of  the  Iraqi  challenge
and demand informed and clear-headed analysis, not simplistic and  bombastic
outbursts. Only people with different hidden agendas  can  misrepresent  our
efforts and seek to discredit them.

The DP must answer some burning questions. Are the almost 10 million  people
who formed some of the largest marches in history throughout the  world  and
who marched in support of tackling the  issue  of  Iraq's  weapons  of  mass
destruction peacefully, reflecting genuine concerns and fears? What  is  the
Opposition's position on war and peace? Are they honest  enough  to  discuss
the consequences of a war? How can we, as  South  Africans,  be  accused  of
destroying  multilateralism  by  supporting  the  full   implementation   of
Security Council Resolution 1441?

As I said earlier, they must tell us  and  the  nation:  What  is  the  real
objective in spreading lies that the South African Government has  an  anti-
American agenda and not an antiwar  agenda?  [Interjections.]  Let  me  tell
those members on my left that we will not be deterred by these dinosaurs  of
politics. We will continue to do our work. History  will  judge  whether  we
were doing the correct work or not. [Applause.]

Mr President, over the last few days a South African delegation met  with  a
top-level delegation of former Israeli intelligence and  security  personnel
-  something  that  these  people  refuse  to  talk  about.  We  shared  our
experiences regarding the South  African  negotiation  process,  peacemaking
and transition to democracy. We also looked  at  the  continuing  challenges
and the fears and  aspirations  of  our  people.  The  Israeli  intelligence
delegation gave their full account of the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict  and
ways of resolving it.

Mr President, your message of South Africa's  intensified  efforts  to  have
continuous engagements with all the parties to seek a peaceful  solution  to
the conflict was highly appreciated.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: What about Zimbabwean ... [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: We are convinced that  the  meeting,
as part of the many initiatives under the Spier process  led  by  you,  will
make an  important  contribution  to  peace  and  stability  in  Israel  and
Palestine.

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: What about Southern Africa?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: On the  African  continent,  we  are
making quite important progress in Burundi and the DRC. [Interjections.]

HON MEMBERS: What about Zimbabwe?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: I am coming  to  you,  and  I  won't
elaborate, because these clowns are just wasting my time. [Laughter.]

We remain concerned about the situation in Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan and  Somalia
and will continue to support all the efforts to end these conflicts. On  all
these issues, we will ensure that Parliament  and  the  portfolio  committee
are regularly briefed.

Mr President, once again, we have  been  subjected  to  hysterical  concerns
about our  so-called  failure  to  tackle  the  Zimbabwe  issue.  We  remain
convinced that the collapse of Zimbabwe will have serious  implications  for
the whole region and especially South Africa. Why should  we  want  this  to
happen? Our quiet diplomacy is criticised without any  credible  suggestions
on what we should do more than what we are doing. Our critics, who are  just
noisy windbags, fail to  explain  what  megaphone  diplomacy  has  achieved.
[Interjections.]  They  fail  or  refuse  to  acknowledge  that  since   the
political and economic crisis started we have  been  tirelessly  engaged  in
efforts to help the Zimbabweans deal with their crisis. [Interjections.]

Any honest person not motivated by hidden agendas or irrational  fears  must
acknowledge that we have consistently, bilaterally or through  SADC,  raised
areas of concern and sought  solutions.  The  Commonwealth  mandated  us  to
engage with the Zimbabweans to tackle some of  these  issues.  As  you  have
said on so many occasions, Mr President, there has been some  progress  and,
inter  alia,  the  Zimbabweans  have  agreed  to  look  at  some  of   their
legislation regarding the media. They will also  look  at  legislation  that
has been described as antidemocratic. The issue of thousands of  Zimbabweans
of Mozambican and Malawian origin is being tackled.

We initiated discussions between the MDC and Zanu PF. These,  unfortunately,
were stopped because the legality of the elections was challenged  in  court
by the MDC. Zanu PF will not resume  the  talks  until  the  court  case  is
completed. However,  we  will  continue  with  our  objectives  to  get  the
negotiations going. The Zimbabwean government has  declared  that  the  land
distribution programme is over and they admit that some mistakes were  made.
[Interjections.] They have assured us  that  discussions  are  taking  place
with Zimbabwean farmers who lost their farms. There are,  of  course,  still
some areas of concern that we are discussing  and  we  hope  that  solutions
will be found.

Let me, once again, categorically state that we  reject  any  suggestion  of
regime change by force. Also, no Zimbabwean has called  for  sanctions,  and
so that is not an option. We must, dear members,  accept  the  reality  that
Zimbabwe is not the 10th province of South Africa.  Sadly,  the  DP,  as  it
always does, is trying to whip up minority fears by suggesting that what  is
happening in Zimbabwe will happen in South Africa. [Interjections.] This  is
a very dangerous game and I urge them not to persist with this position.

In the interests of Zimbabwe and the region, let  us  constructively  assist
all Zimbabweans to jointly find a solution. The crude politicisation of  the
Cricket  World  Cup  is  unacceptable,  deepens   antagonisms   and   delays
solutions. I hope that the DP will wake  up.  Delport  said  that  he  wants
people to join his party to get onto a new road. The only road on which  you
can go with the DP is to hell. [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

Mr President, In your address you said, and I quote:


  As we enter the last year of the first decade of freedom,  we  will  heed
  the lessons of these first 10 years and build on what has been  achieved,
  and with renewed courage we must, together, approach the second decade of
  freedom as one in  which  the  tide  of  progress  will  sweep  away  the
  accumulated legacy of poverty and underdevelopment.

Unfortunately you did not mention the DP. You continued and said:


  The tide has turned. The people's  contract  for  a  better  tomorrow  is
  taking shape. I trust that all of us will  identify  with  this  historic
  process. Given the great possibility we have to move forward, we dare not
  falter.

I want to assure you, Mr President, that our foreign and  domestic  policies
will be driven by this vision. We will succeed,  despite  the  purveyors  of
doom and gloom sitting on the benches of the DP. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF PUBLIC  WORKS:  Madam  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the
President and His Excellency the Deputy President, hon members, it  was  the
Greek philosopher  Plato  who  said:  ``A  nonexamined  life  is  not  worth
living.'' And so it is that we are gathered here as a collective  leadership
of this country to examine the life and output of our Government. We  do  so
not to criticise destructively or to score cheap political  points,  but  to
engage in what is our very sacred duty as  members  of  this  House  and  as
representatives of the people. That sacred duty is to  honestly  reflect  on
progress made thus far and to identify  shortcomings  in  order  to  correct
them.

The President outlined what is a huge  undertaking  by  the  Government,  to
improve the quality of life of all South  Africans.  This  provides  a  good
framework within which individuals, groupings, communities and  private  and
public economic entities can pull together in  the  direction  of  progress.
The Government has shown the way by initiating a  number  of  programmes  in
this regard. What remains is for our people to also play their part.

The Government cannot do everything. It is, in fact, unrealistic  to  expect
it to do so. It can only do that much. The greatest challenge  that  remains
is for the people for whom the various products of Government  policies  and
programmes  are  meant  to  come  forward  and  take  advantage   of   these
initiatives. The Government must, in providing whatever service, do so in  a
manner that avoids dampening the spirit of enterprise and  initiative  among
the people. There should always be room for self-help and  self-reliance  so
that our people are able to take pride in what they themselves  are  capable
of doing.

Quite clearly, the efforts of Government will only fully succeed  in  making
things work if there is a healthy and reliable  partnership  between  itself
and the people it serves. That is why it  is  extremely  important  that  an
integrative nation-building process should continue to cultivate,  highlight
and inculcate values of patriotism and loyalty to the broader South  African
nation. To this end, it is extremely  important  that  such  patriotism  and
loyalty to our nation should be manifested and recognised on both  sides  of
this House.

I come back to what I referred to earlier on,  namely  that  when  we  speak
here and raise critical questions, we do so not to  ridicule  or  embarrass,
but to highlight and applaud achievement and to  decry  and  pour  scorn  on
inefficiency, underachievement and utter failure.

When we meet here to reflect on the state of the nation address,  we  do  so
not only to weaken and destroy, but to improve and build. For we are all  in
this together, and we either have to swim or sink together. It  is  in  this
context that I would like to appeal to our colleagues and comrades  on  this
side of the House to regard critical comments from the  other  side  of  the
House as well intended. The trouble is that even though we are all  Africans
here, we follow procedures that are not of African origin  in  nature,  such
as being compelled at times to do  what  you  would  normally  avoid  doing,
namely  hanging  our  dirty  linen  in  public.  For  example,  the  Western
democratic method which we follow here actually encourages that  members  of
the same family should, in the presence of strangers, point fingers  at  one
another.

I now want to talk about one of the key  announcements  that  the  President
made in the state of the nation address, namely  that  the  Government  will
embark on an expanded public works programme in order to help alleviate  the
chronic problem of poverty and unemployment. We  welcome  this  announcement
as a step in the right direction because unless we find ways to  temper  the
growing tide of unemployment, it will be difficult to overcome  the  problem
of poverty.

So in the Department of Public Works we have begun to roll up  our  sleeves,
to get on with the necessary preparatory work in order to get  the  expanded
public works programme off the ground as soon as possible. This will  entail
identifying candidate projects in various Government departments  that  will
need to be realigned and run along the now tried and  tested  principles  of
our Community-Based Public Works Programme.

The  President  has  given  us  in  the   department   this   very   serious
responsibility and daunting task of co-ordinating this programme,  not  only
among Government departments at the national sphere, but across all  spheres
of Government.

So what is critical to the success of the expanded  public  works  programme
is to understand the underlying principles underpinning it,  that  it  seeks
to utilise labour-intensive approaches where  appropriate  in  the  delivery
and maintenance of  infrastructure;  restore  and  enhance  the  dignity  of
labour, and thus inculcate the work ethic; restore the dignity of  the  poor
and the unemployed; destroy the  culture  of  entitlement  and  waiting  for
handouts and replace it with the notion of self-help and self-reliance;  and
ensure that in the process  of  people  being  drafted  into  the  envisaged
public works programmes,  skills  will  be  gained  which  people  can  then
utilise elsewhere.

As the  programme  unfolds  it  is  expected  that  it  will  align  current
infrastructure programmes  of  Government  and  state-owned  enterprises  to
maximise work opportunities  for  the  poor  and  the  unemployed.  It  will
provide  specific  opportunities  for  women,  youth  and  the  disabled  by
targeting these vulnerable groups. It will also create useful public  assets
that will provide social improvements and facilitate participation by  micro
enterprises, especially emerging contractors.

We are mindful of the plight of the unemployed  youth,  some  with  tertiary
qualifications. We need to find ways to overcome this  problem.  Perhaps  it
is time that work was finalised speedily on the national  youth  service  so
that  this  programme  could  also  help  tackle  the   problem   of   youth
unemployment before it is too late. As we plan  for  the  implementation  of
the expanded public works programme, we  are  challenged  to  plan  for  the
involvement of our youth as well.

Finally, we want to  thank  our  President  for  championing  the  cause  of
Africa, for it is by promoting the cause of Africa  that  the  interests  of
South Africa as a whole will be advanced. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Speaker, the President on  Friday  said  that  ``unlike
the 20th, the 21st century should be a century of African peace''. Now  this
century for African peace must begin with the creation of conditions of  law
and order and political and economic stability. It must also begin with  the
creation of a community of African security. Our understanding  of  security
must change from the old dichotomy of war or peace to the concept  of  human
security.  And  this  means  that  there  is  less  concentration   on   the
procurement  of  arms  and  deployment  of  troops.  There  is  more   about
strengthening  the  social  and  environmental  fabric  of   societies   and
improving their governance. Our own  thebula  [comrade]  Dr  Rocky  Williams
says:


  To avoid instability, a human security policy must take  into  account  a
  complex web of social, economic, environmental and political factors.

I submit that any national security is meaningless if it does not  encompass
the preservation of liveable conditions in this world. This finds  resonance
in the objectives of the African Union, which are, in  fact,  in  line  with
the provisions of the Constitution of this Republic and are  echoed  by  the
objectives of the UN  Security  Council.  In  fact,  this  is  what  Michael
Renner, a human scientist, had to say in 1992:


  A reasonable definition of security needs to encompass breathable air and
  potable water,  safe  from  radioactive  and  toxic  hazards,  an  intact
  climatic system, and protection against the loss of topsoil that  assures
  us our daily  bread.  The  wellbeing  of  nations  and  their  individual
  citizens depends  as  much  on  economic  vitality,  social  justice  and
  ecological stability as it does on safety from foreign  attack.  Pursuing
  military security  at  the  cost  of  these  other  factors  is  akin  to
  dismantling a house to salvage materials to erect a fence around it.

And I must say, this is what we saw in Afghanistan, and, if the war in  Iraq
proceeds, this is what we are likely to see there.

South Africa has once again demonstrated  her  commitment  to  the  peaceful
resolution of conflict. Facilitating the meeting over the  weekend  to  find
solutions for the Middle East  crisis  and  sending  a  delegation  to  Iraq
cannot be downplayed. These are  significant  political  contributions  this
country has made, and those  of  us  who  love  peace  appreciate  this  and
congratulate the President  of  this  country.  The  call  for  the  African
century for peace reflects the ideals and prayers of  millions  of  Africans
who have experienced different  forms  of  conflict  and  deprivation.  This
statement reflects the pain, the anger, the  desperation  of  African  women
when we have called for peace, for democracy  and  therefore  for  equality,
for development and for prosperity.

There is no way we  will  say  yes  to  the  war  in  Iraq.  No  excuse,  no
explanation, no justification can convince us that to disarm one nation  all
other nations of the world must be threatened by  the  spectre  of  war.  No
individual, no nation must have the right to  threaten  the  dreams  of  the
millions or the dignity of humanity as we know it and  the  personal  safety
of children all over the world. This is in no way saying that  as  women  we
support the manufacture,  the  purchase,  the  stockpiling  or  the  use  of
weapons of mass destruction. Iraq must disarm  if  it  is  found  to  be  in
possession of such weapons. The committees of defence will  be  receiving  a
briefing from the biochemical weapons inspection team that recently went  to
Iraq.

The President spoke about the need to regulate the  security  apparatus  and
to ensure that they do what they were set up to do. This means that we  must
know what they are supposed to do and we  must  be  able  to  hold  them  to
account. The security of our borders and the  rural  communities  cannot  be
compromised and will not be compromised.
Now, whilst some commando units do sterling work to protect the  communities
and the lives of the communities within their  geographic  responsibilities,
some have been cause for great concern. The big  question  really  has  been
whether  we  should  not  consider  alternative  means   to   secure   rural
communities better and more  appropriately  while  we  release  the  reserve
forces to carry out their constitutional obligations. I must say  here  that
the commandos are actually what is known as  the  territorial  forces.  They
are part of the reserve forces, and that is what  they  must  be,  with  the
increased demand on the SA National Defence  Force  to  do  a  lot  of  work
internationally. We need to release these members of the reserve  forces  to
do what they actually must do, and that is to participate in  the  exercises
of peace missions and humanitarian aid across the globe.

The committees on defence began a process looking at how we  rejuvenate  the
reserve forces of South Africa. We will be  looking  at  military  histories
and cultures, race, gender and age  as  criteria  towards  the  rejuvenation
process of the defence force. We will continue to  advocate  more  resources
to go to the preparations of these reserve forces, for, as I said, the  work
that awaits them is great. The Constitution, the White Paper on Defence  and
the Defence Act spell out our national and  international  obligations,  and
to meet them we need an active and vibrant reserve force.

National studies have shown us the levels of  skills  we  possess  as  South
Africa. The United Nations Human Index Report of 1999-2000 showed  that  our
critical skill weaknesses force us to look at reskilling the  South  African
nation. Whereas members of the National Defence Force are considered  to  be
skilled in their core functions, the service corps was intended  to  reskill
those who are destined for separation. We need to  give  more  attention  to
this programme this year.

A lot has been said about the age and health profile of the  defence  force,
and sometimes with a lot of  exaggerations.  A  restructured  service  corps
will not only contribute to the reskilling of the  members  of  the  defence
force, but could help all other Government departments  participate  towards
a skilled and prosperous South Africa.

The President encouraged this Parliament to  ratify  the  protocols  on  the
Peace and Security Council and the African  Parliament.  This  is  exciting.
Article 3(f) of the Constitutive Act of the  African  Union  refers  to  the
promotion of peace, security and stability in the continent. Articles  3(c),
(d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (k),  (l)  and  (m)  all  state  the  intention  to
integrate policies, mechanisms and systems.  A  quick  look  at  Nepad  also
shows that whilst it is structured in three components, its  overall  pillar
is also about regional integration. The focus  of  the  Peace  and  Security
Council will be to -


  ... anticipate and prevent conflicts. In  circumstances  where  conflicts
  have  occurred,  the  Peace  and  Security   Council   shall   have   the
  responsibility to undertake peace-making and peace-building functions for
  the resolution of these conflicts ...

So the attempt of this Government  to  prevent  the  escalation  of  violent
conflict in Zimbabwe is actually in line with the aspirations of  the  AU  -
protection against loss of life and property rather than  us  standing  here
and judging who is right and who is wrong  in  Zimbabwe.  That  is  not  the
issue. Is it not time for us all to constructively look at solutions and  to
stop bickering?  The  protocol  enjoins  us  to  harmonise  and  co-ordinate
efforts  to  combat  international  terrorism.  It  makes  a  call  for  the
promotion of democratic practices, good governance, the  rule  of  law,  the
protection of human rights and fundamental  freedoms  and  respect  for  the
sanctity of human life.

For us the need to develop a common defence  policy  for  the  continent  is
good news. For we have been calling for  this  initiative  for  many  years.
This will add to a better co-ordination and forge trust amongst the  nations
of Africa. This will make mandatory the standardisation of command  systems,
policies and equipment. This will in turn  mean  less  need  for  individual
nations to arm themselves against others and therefore will lead to  better-
targeted social spending in the continent.

Many years ago Mwalimu Nyerere, Dr Kaunda and Sir  Seretse  Khama  formed  a
very vibrant and informal forum. Samora Machel  and  Agostinho  Neto  joined
this group later and they went on to  form  the  Frontline  States  to  help
speed up the eradication of colonialist and racist regimes. Much  later,  as
freedom entered those two countries, Zimbabwe and Namibia joined  them.  The
SADCC - with two Cs - was born in 1990 to co-ordinate economic  co-operation
in order to reduce dependence on apartheid South Africa. A few years ago  we
celebrated a decade of the transformation of the  SADCC  with  two  Cs  into
SADC with one C, which recognised  the  interrelationship  between  economic
development, peace and stability, and that is where  the  founders  expanded
the mandate in 1992 to include political, military and security matters.

So in 1992, the leaders in SADC committed member states to peace,  security,
human rights, democracy, the rule of law  and  the  peaceful  resolution  of
disputes. At the conference of  players  and  scholars  late  last  year  in
Maputo, we examined why  the  noble  ideas  of  the  regions  had  not  been
achieved. The establishment of the AU Peace and Security Council means  that
we must look at the existing regional instruments,  analyse  them  and  make
recommendations.

The protocols for the OPDS - the Organ on Politics, Defence and  Security  -
were only signed in 2001 even though the decision  to  establish  the  organ
had been taken in 1996. We must avoid delays like this.

The OPDS has three main problems, I think. One is that  the  chairpersonship
rotates annually. This is a weakness because it means that the  organ  loses
on institutional memory each time the chairperson takes  the  secretary  and
goes. The second weakness is that at its inception there  was  no  provision
made for its administrative capacity. In fact, the organ  continues  to  use
the old ISDSC as its secretariat. And the third weakness is that  the  organ
never produced a programmatic plan of action.

Perhaps these weaknesses are  a  throwback  to  the  informal  days  of  the
Frontline States and the ISDSC as well as the political  alignment  and  the
lack of trust that existed  among  SADC  countries  in  those  days.  Having
concluded its mandate, the Frontline States closed shop in 1994.  But  as  I
said, the ISDSC continues to function until the Organ on  Politics,  Defence
and Security is operational.

The SADC players, the members of academia and civil society have  identified
key threats to security in the region. One of them is food security. And  we
agree that the effective management of this issue is critical to the  region
and has serious implications for  regional  development  and  stability.  We
need to co-ordinate efforts in this regard. For instance, we could  look  at
pricing, subsidies and marketing controls.

The second threat we have identified is that millions  in  the  SADC  region
are said to be under the threat of HIV/Aids. Among those seriously  affected
are the military  personnel.  Could  this  have  any  impact  on  our  force
structures and therefore the readiness of this  region  to  protect  itself?
What then would be - if this has any impact - the levels  of  stability  and
what would happen to the territorial integrity of nations? We need  to  have
better co-ordinated approaches to preventive strategies,  to  treatment,  to
drug distribution, to research and to the funding of HIV/Aids programmes  in
the region. The third threat which we have identified  is  around  political
transitions, weak parliaments and skewed resource allocations.

The launch of the International Law Enforcement Academy in Botswana in  2001
has allowed some regional training  to  take  place  and  for  the  Regional
Association of Police Commissioners to structure programmes that  prioritise
regional needs. But there is still  a  lot  of  work  that  we  need  to  do
together. For instance, we need to have common  approaches  to  cross-border
crimes, and we need to work on approaches to deal with the proliferation  of
small arms across the region. South Africa has promised in the  White  Paper
on Defence to establish a regional register for all arms. We have yet to  do
this.

Although everybody has agreed to  the  new  African  Contingency  Operations
Training and Assistance Programme for the military, which  should  focus  us
on regional training needs and priorities,  nothing  is  coming  out  of  it
because the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security is nonfunctional.  This,
then, forces the region to continue to work within bilateral  agreements.  I
am not  saying,  Comrade  President,  that  there  is  anything  wrong  with
bilaterals; all I am saying is that we still have no idea of  the  economies
of shared training and other training needs which we could  have  identified
had we begun this regional integration of personnel equipment and systems.

Some of the governments in the region derive close to 60% of their  spending
and of their national budgets from donors,  and  we  need  to  consider  the
financial implications of joint training. We would therefore need  to  start
looking at what contributions we need to make if Africa is to have  a  joint
standing force  of  her  own.  In  short,  Comrade  President,  we  need  to
restructure the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security. [Applause.]
Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon President, Deputy  President  and  members,
in response to the President's state of the nation address, I would like  to
highlight one or two issues. With regard to  the  Government's  response  to
fighting the HIV/Aids pandemic the President said, and I quote:


  Working  together  with  Sanac,  we  will  continue  to   implement   the
  Government's comprehensive strategy on HIV  and  Aids,  relating  to  all
  elements of the strategy. This includes implementation of  the  decisions
  of the Constitutional Court.

If Government has a comprehensive strategy to fight HIV/Aids  and  to  treat
persons infected with HIV, why is it  necessary  for  one  of  its  alliance
partners, Cosatu, to take to the streets with the  TAC  to  protest  against
Government's response to the HIV/Aids pandemic?

If Government is unable to convince its own alliance partners  that  it  has
an effective workable plan to stem the tide of the  HIV/Aids  pandemic,  how
do you hope to convince the world that what you are doing in this regard  is
correct?
There have been many calls by several social sectors on Government  to  sign
and implement a national treatment and prevention plan,  but  to  no  avail.
The march organised by the TAC and Cosatu was another such attempt to  shake
Government out of its slumber. But again the  President  glosses  over  this
pandemic as if it is a peripheral issue.

The crux of  the  HIV/Aids  issue  is  well  summarised  by  Di  Caelers,  a
journalist for the Cape Argus , when  she  writes  in  an  article  for  the
Weekend Argus of 15 February, and I quote:


  In Europe, paediatricians expect children infected with HIV  to  live  to
  adulthood - a far cry from the South African situation, where the  advent
  of antiretroviral life-prolonging medication has pushed  to  new  heights
  the imbalance between resources and needs.  With  people  here  dying  in
  their thousands of Aids, as all sectors are denied treatment,  it  cannot
  be argued that it is children with HIV who  are  most  likely  to  suffer
  disease and early death.

The response of Government regarding a  national  treatment  and  prevention
plan is that it is unaffordable. The argument goes that antiretrovirals  are
too expensive and there are too many HIV-infected children:  ``If  we  treat
this one child, then we must treat them all, and there is simply not  enough
money in the budget for that.'' Why is a national treatment  and  prevention
plan to fight HIV/Aids not a national priority? If  there  is  no  money  to
treat HIV-infected children in our country, why is there  money  to  send  a
team of government officials and scientists, technicians and engineers in  a
high-risk peace mission to Iraq? What is it costing this Government to  send
such a mission to Iraq?

The Human Sciences Research Council estimates that 375 000  South  Africans,
including children, are dying of Aids. The price is too high.  If  the  tide
must turn, let it also turn for those children that are not treated. Let  it
also turn for 27% of our population who are  unemployed.  Let  it  turn  for
thousands of ordinary South Africans who, every day, are robbed,  raped  and
traumatised by those criminal elements who  have  no  respect  for  law  and
order. If the tide must turn, let it  turn  for  the  better  of  all  South
Africans.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, hon President, hon Deputy President,  at  the
march on Friday, about 30 000 people  from  all  walks  of  life,  including
women and children, marched to  demand  treatment  and  antiretrovirals.  My
experience was that of anger, disappointment and despair.

My questions therefore are, Mr President:  How  dare  you  leave  this  Aids
pandemic in the hands of Sanac? Do you know that Sanac never met  once,  and
their technical committee never met once in one year?  [Interjections.]  Did
you create Sanac to deal with Aids so that the Cabinet can  continue  to  go
around the world not worrying about the pandemic? Is it true that Sanac  has
R1 billion to spend on treatment? If so, how are they  going  to  spend  it?
Can Sanac produce minutes since its inception in  January  2000?  They  have
hardly had any meetings. Sanac is loaded with dissidents.

Sadly, either you are deceiving us, or all of you  are  living  in  a  dream
world, to think that Sanac has got the  leadership  that  should  lead  this
Aids pandemic. Sanac has no leaders that personify the struggle against  the
disease and does not support treatment or  the  concept  of  mother-to-child
transmission. Where are the hands and feet of Sanac to  do  the  work  while
the leadership is slumbering?
Connected to the debate  is  also  the  Government's  inertia  on  the  Aids
pandemic and social grants. Even if you set the grant cut-off age at 21,  it
is not going to help,  because  we  do  not  have  the  capacity  to  spend.
Billions of rands of social welfare spending are returned  to  the  Treasury
every year whilst the poor are continuing to suffer. We all know the  truth,
so let us now speak the truth and stop blowing hot air. Aids causes  poverty
and it is not poverty that causes Aids.

Mr President, how are we going to get the grants to the people? How  can  we
help to attain this goal? At the rate that the Minister  is  complaining,  I
am led to believe that his real capacity lack is that of brain capacity.  So
I am offering assistance in the presence of all  in  this  House,  and  this
country and the nation, that they must all  help  to  make  this  country  a
better place and an empowering place for all of us to live in. I thank  you.
[Applause.]

Dr Z P JORDAN: Madam Speaker, Comrade President,  Comrade  Deputy  President
and hon members and comrades,  war  clouds  are  gathering  with  increasing
momentum as we pass the midpoint of the second month of 2003. A century  and
eight months ago another war came to an end at Vereeniging. In its  day  the
Anglo-Boer War, which ended on  the  31st  of  May  1902,  was  regarded  as
emblematic of the powerful bullying the weak.

Under the pretext that Kruger's South  African  Republic  was  undemocratic,
Britain had attempted to effect what is now known as a regime change in  the
South African Republic, but Dr Starr  Jameson  was  no  Rambo.  His  mission
failed even before he had set out. Kruger's government had recently  subdued
the  neighbouring  Venda  kingdom  in  a  war  of  aggression  and   African
communities that had submitted to  the  Boer  yoke  earlier  were  rightless
helots amongst whom the Boer farmers could impress labourers.

When the war broke  out  in  1899,  with  the  exception  of  Turkey,  every
European  government  opposed  Britain,  and  an  unusual  consensus  ensued
amongst otherwise mutually competitive  imperial  powers.  They  became  odd
bedfellows in their shared antagonism  towards  Britain.  It  was  generally
acknowledged that Britain, the 19th century's principal imperial power,  had
precipitated the war to gain control of South Africa's mineral wealth.

Within every nation in Europe public opinion was overwhelmingly critical  of
Britain. On this issue Tzar Nicholas II and his archenemies  the  populists,
the social democrats  and  the  anarchists  found  themselves  in  the  same
trench. In Germany Kaiser Wilhelm was able  to  exploit  vocal  anti-British
sentiment to his  advantage  and  piloted  a  naval  construction  programme
through the Reichstag virtually unopposed.  In  France  the  socialists  and
radicals sat comfortably in the company of their political opponents on  the
right in a movement  not  dissimilar  to  the  broad  spectrum  of  opinions
opposing the war plans of the Bush administration in our day.

Britain felt herself vindicated by her immense wealth as well as her  system
of government. Though women in Britain could not  yet  vote,  men  from  the
propertied and middle classes enjoyed a full franchise. The Reform  Act  had
also extended the franchise to significant  layers  of  urban  working-class
men, making Britain one  of  the  most  advanced  liberal  democracies.  The
policies pursued in Britain's two Southern African colonies,  the  Cape  and
Natal, seemed also to confirm this.

The Cape's policy of a franchise for all  civilised  men  in  principle  was
colour-blind. African and coloured voters in the Cape consequently  made  up
important constituencies that white politicians ignored at their  peril.  In
Natal  the  more  conservative  white  minority  had  effectively  kept  the
franchise from all but six black potential voters despite official  rhetoric
about a colour-blind property owners' franchise.

Yes indeed, compared to  the  two  Boer  republics,  which  were  explicitly
undemocratic, the political arrangements in Britain  and  her  two  colonies
were infinitely better. But, the Anglo-Boer War was  fought  and  won  at  a
time when the African continent was considered the empire builders' oyster.

We are at the beginning of a new  century  during  which  Africa  will  take
charge of her own destiny through  a  comprehensive  programme  of  renewal.
During 2002 we inaugurated the African Union to replace the Organisation  of
African Unity, the OAU. The AU will take  forward  this  new  phase  of  the
African struggle  for  emancipation.  Its  weaknesses  and  numerous  faults
notwithstanding, the OAU was wound up after successfully completing  one  of
the  principal  tasks  it  had  set  itself  in  1963;  the  eradication  of
colonialism and apartheid from our continent.

The new partnership for Africa's development, Nepad, will join a  long  list
of disheartening failures if it does not  address  the  principal  challenge
facing  the  African  continent  today,  and  that  is  the   challenge   of
eradicating poverty.

The information revolution sweeping the most developed parts  of  the  world
has been compared to the agrarian and industrial revolutions, both of  which
radically transformed the way human societies were organised.  The  futurist
Alvin Toffler has referred to it as the  ``third  wave''.  Measured  against
Toffler's projections there is a real danger that Africa  could  be  further
marginalised, considering that the greater part of the continent  still  has
to experience an industrial revolution.

The ``third wave'' differs from the earlier two because of its  reliance  on
the  technical  innovations  of  the  latter  part  of  the  20th   century.
Telecommunications is the backbone of the  information  revolution  and  the
key infrastructure for its growth and development.  Trends  in  that  sector
have already established a daunting lead, separating the  telecommunications
haves from the telecommunications have-nots. Among the latter Africa is  one
of the least well-endowed.

If Africa is not to be left behind, we need to consider  what  needs  to  be
done in South Africa, in the first instance, and in the rest of Africa.  The
growth,   development   and   sophistication   of   our   telecommunications
infrastructure  self-evidently  will  provide  the  platform   for   further
advance. Clearly, we must develop  this  as  the  service  backbone  of  the
information  society  alongside  manufacturing,  mining   and   agriculture,
together with the requisite human resources. The danger  of  a  digital  gap
has been identified.

From 18th-century Britain, where it began,  the  Industrial  Revolution  had
spread to every part of Northwestern Europe and the  United  States  by  the
end of the 19th century. The latecomers built  on  the  foundation  laid  in
Britain. None of them was required to  reinvent  the  steam  engine  or  the
various industrial processes pioneered by the British. They were  thus  able
to leapfrog and even overtake the pioneer country.
The United States, Germany and Japan did exactly that during the first  half
of the 20th century. The newly industrialised countries of the  Pacific  Rim
that grew and developed during the last three decades of  the  20th  century
offer even more interesting examples.

Africa, like all these other parts of the world, will be required  to  stand
on the shoulders  of  other  countries'  achievements.  The  roll-out  of  a
continental    telecommunications    capacity    alongside    a    transport
infrastructure is the sine qua non for the  success  of  Nepad.  It  is  now
common cause that South Africa's economy  is  extremely  distorted.  Comrade
President in his speech spoke of  a  dual  economy.  These  are  distortions
rooted in the specific features  of  the  capitalism  that  evolved  in  the
context of colonial dispossession, a coercive labour system and  a  racially
defined and disenfranchised proletariat.

The dogma that the state, no matter what its character,  can  only  play  an
obstructive role in the economy, will not stand  close  scrutiny.  The  20th
century is replete with examples that demonstrate the  exact  opposite.  Not
least amongst these are the newly industrialised countries  of  the  Pacific
Rim. The expansion of  the  public  works  programmes  is  therefore  to  be
welcomed,  as  is  a  more  comprehensive   approach   to   black   economic
empowerment.

But black  economic  empowerment  must  avoid  the  perils  of  old  elites,
emergent propertied classes and greedy wabenzis looting  the  state  coffers
in  an  orgy  of  self-enrichment.  Transparency  in   awarding   Government
contracts and an attitude of zero tolerance towards  corruption  will  deter
those who might be otherwise tempted. [Interjections.]

South Africa must remain seized of the problem of Zimbabwe  for  reasons  of
altruism and of self-interest. [Interjections.] Zimbabwe  is  our  neighbour
and also our largest trading partner on the African continent.  Besides  the
historic links between the two countries, the economies of South Africa  and
Zimbabwe developed as intertwined. The repercussions  of  a  total  economic
meltdown in Zimbabwe will be felt in  the  streets  of  Johannesburg  within
hours.

Self-interest  dictates  that  we  assist  Zimbabwe  back   to   its   feet.
[Interjections.] Assisting a neighbour in trouble does  not  translate  into
interfering in its internal  affairs.  The  problems  of  Zimbabwe  will  be
solved by the people of that country, but it is self-evident that  the  high
degree of polarisation in that society cannot be helpful and some  mechanism
will have to be devised to draw the two sides of the  conflict  closer.  The
pressing need for national dialogue among the  key  players,  civil  society
and other stakeholders is now recognised by both  the  governing  party  and
the opposition.

I would submit too that the  question  of  Zimbabwe's  continued  suspension
from the Commonwealth and a regime of sanctions need to be examined  against
that backdrop. The crucial question we must ask is: Will  the  outcomes  our
actions are likely to produce benefit or harm the people of Zimbabwe?

As Comrade President has said,  we  prefer  peace  to  war,  we  want  peace
because we know from our own experience that peace is the  precondition  for
development. War brings death  and  destruction,  and  in  their  wake  come
poverty, deprivation and despair. Our demand for peace is designed,  neither
to let the Iraqi authorities off the hook, nor to frustrate  United  Nations
efforts to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction.

As a movement the ANC has stood opposed to weapons of mass  destruction  for
decades, and our opposition is not partial. We call  for  the  abolition  of
all weapons of mass destruction, be they in the hands of  Iraq,  the  United
States of America, Britain, France, Israel, Pakistan, India,  China,  Russia
or North Korea. [Applause.] We would insist, too, that if the  weapons  Iraq
allegedly  possesses  pose  a  danger  to  world  peace  and   international
security, the international community has created an instrument, the  United
Nations Organisation, for our collective security. No-one  has  devolved  on
the US and its alliance of the willing the  responsibility  of  safeguarding
international security.

Those who have read and understood the history  of  the  League  of  Nations
need to remind president Bush and his willing helpers that it was the bully-
boy tactics of the powerful states and the unilateralism  that  reduced  the
League of Nations to irrelevance. For those who actually have lived  through
and with  the  consequences  of  war,  peace  and  stability  are  not  mere
abstractions.  As  the  chicken  hawks,  bar  one,   who   lead   the   Bush
administration can testify, the sons of millionaires, the  superwealthy  and
other members of elites can usually buy their way out of fighting wars.  The
poor pay for wars with the sweat, tears, blood  and  the  corpses  of  their
young.

In addition they also have to pay taxes. When the funds  are  diverted  from
social spending to defence and  security  it  is  the  poor  who  invariably
suffer. This is especially true in Africa, where instability and  wars  have
all but destroyed the promise of independence. The  pursuance  of  stability
and peace requires eschewal  of  zero-sum  politics  in  Africa.  Democratic
governance is the essential ingredient for the success of that project.

At the beginning of the previous century the gold standard  established  the
centrality of gold as the international medium of exchange. The First  World
War demonstrated that oil, both as an  energy  source  and  as  our  primary
lubricant, would acquire an importance greater  than  gold  in  the  future,
because it keeps the cogs of our industrial society turning. Four  days  ago
Lawrence Ferlinghetti,  a  poet  whom  I  like  from  my  youth,  wrote  the
following lines:


  And a vast paranoia sweeps across the land
  And America turns the attack on its Twin Towers
  Into the beginning of the Third World War
  The war with the Third World
  And the terrorists in Washington
  Are drafting all the young men
  And no one speaks
  And they are rousting out
  All the ones with turbans
  And they are flushing out
  All the strange immigrants
  And they are shipping all the young men
  To the killing fields again
  And no one speaks
  And when they come to round up
  All the great writers and poets and painters
  The National Endowment of the Arts of Complacency
  Will not speak
  While all the young men
  Will be killing all the young men
  In the killing fields again
  So now is the time for you to speak
  All you lovers of liberty
  All you lovers of the pursuit of happiness
  All you lovers and sleepers
  Deep in your private dreams
  Now is the time for you to speak
  O silent majority
  Before they come for you

... and you and you and you, and maybe me. [Laughter.]

This past weekend over 30 million people spread over 600 cities  across  the
world spoke out and it is our fervent hope that the powerful are  listening.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Madam Speaker, in his state  of  the  nation  address  one
expected the President of this country to report to Parliament,  and  so  to
the nation, how Government had succeeded in removing  the  stumbling  blocks
that hinder good governance, the eradication and downscaling of poverty  and
unemployment, and the curbing of violent crime.

Instead of continually telling us how tough they will be  on  criminals,  we
expect Government to go out, nail them and jail them. We expect the  ANC  to
lead by example. Instead, what do we  get?  We  see  the  example  of  their
suspending a member of Parliament who admits to  corruption.  We  say,  ``Do
not pay him another day's salary as a member of Parliament.''
What we would have loved to hear from the ANC speakers and the President  is
that no longer are 45 to 55 people  murdered  on  a  daily  basis  in  South
Africa - nine on one day in Sea Point. We wish to hear that  no  longer  are
scores of women and babies raped on a  daily  basis  in  South  Africa;  and
although 30 000 vehicles have been hijacked in South Africa during the  past
two years,  that  Government  is  able  to  bring  culprits  to  book.  This
assurance of crime prevention we did not get from  the  ANC,  nor  from  the
President.

Before 1994 there was no crime code in police files for hijacking  in  South
Africa. Isn't it a pity that the ANC-led Government cannot stop  this  crime
which ruins the lives of  so  many  families  in  South  Africa?  I  have  a
newspaper clipping here of a person who has  been  hijacked  five  times  in
Gauteng.  This  crime  has  come  into  existence  in  the  ANC's  time   of
governance. [Interjections.]  For  the  nation's  sake  the  ANC  must  stop
violent crime. Look at what happened when a murderer  was  pardoned  by  the
President on the advice of one of his Ministers. [Interjections.]

Let's turn to good governance and let me illustrate how the ANC  is  letting
the nation down. In December I asked the Minister for Provincial  and  Local
Government what the total arrears are of government departments in eight  of
the country's largest metro councils. The answer was  that  Government  owes
those metro councils  R323 million.  In  Gauteng  this  amount  grows  at  a
monthly rate of R200 million.

If Government does not pay its dues to local government  ``how  the  hell'',
to use Mr Mandela's words, can local government survive? Why do the  ANC-led
Governments increase their rates and taxes  to  make  ends  meet  when  they
should instead take government departments to court  for  not  paying  their
rates and taxes? Why increase the people's taxes when  Government  fails  to
pay? Surely this is what is wrong with the ANC-led administration?

Look at how, under this presidency, the Government's systems have failed  to
deliver. People in  South  Africa  no  longer  have  faith  in  the  ANC-led
Government. [Interjections.] If they did, why would Mr Mandela want to  take
over the jobs of the Minister of Health  and  of  the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs? Even Roelf Meyer and Pik Botha want to take  over  the  President's
job.

Our President seems desperate. He now takes anyone into  his  Cabinet,  even
Deputy Minister Schoeman and ex-Deputy Minister Malatsi  on  the  advice  of
his ``kortbroek''adviser. In 25 years I have never  seen  such  a  desperate
President. No wonder he goes to sleep  when  his  new  jet  develops  engine
trouble. A man can only take so much. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon President  of  South  Africa,
in April 2002 my cousin, who had just been declared the owner  of  something
called a house in the Bram Fischer settlement near Dobsonville,  invited  me
to see the house. We drove to the area.

When we arrived I immediately noticed that the streets were not  tarred  and
that some of the houses were built on an uneven slope. I also  noticed  that
all the houses, without exception, were  not  partitioned  into  rooms.  The
only partition was a small toilet whose small door led to  a  small  kitchen
space. My immediate remark was: What happens if a member of the  family  has
a runny tummy and other members are cooking in the small kitchen?

Being a member of Parliament made it possible for me to  visit  other  parts
of the country and witness the same  type  of  structure  this  country  has
built for the poor.

Azapo has always held the view that Government is  more  worried  about  the
number of structures it can deliver to the poor than the  quality  of  these
structures. Surely, after eight years of democracy, we should  be  concerned
that we have not devised housing structures that create a  better  life  for
the poor?

The growth of the economy in the various sectors mentioned  in  the  address
by  the  President  is  indeed  an  encouraging  factor  in  so  far  as  it
strengthens economic fundamentals. However, this growth should, at the  same
time, be accompanied by growth in jobs and in the standard of living of  the
poor. The extent to which this is not  happening  is  a  matter  that  Azapo
believes should be attended to with speed.

The lack of a definition of what constitutes black economic empowerment  has
meant  that  black  individuals  have  become  millionaires  without  wealth
filtering down to  the  poor  and  the  workers.  Azapo  believes  that  the
advancement of black economic empowerment should  be  linked  to  the  broad
economic transformation, and to the advancement of the poor's  wellbeing  in
general and their standard of living in particular.

We should not  confuse  black  economic  empowerment  with  individuals  and
individual black companies with the term ``black economic empowerment''.  To
confuse the two is  to  restrict  black  economic  empowerment  to  existing
equity patterns in our country. Azapo is convinced that  the  South  African
economy will benefit greatly  when  the  majority  of  our  citizens  become
participants in all spheres of economic activity.

Just as a good game of cricket or soccer requires acceptance by  players  of
both the rules and of the umpire to interpret and enforce the rules, so  too
the good society we are building requires  that  Government  should  monitor
black  economic  empowerment.  This  requires  that  Government  define  the
parameters,  the  conditions  of  practice  and  the  means  of  arbitrating
different interpretations of the conditions, and insist on  some  device  to
enforce compliance with the rules, as defined by Parliament.

Statistics SA's official figure on unemployment stands  at  about  30%.  The
formal employment sector has in the past decade shed more than  one  million
jobs. Given these statistics, it  was  encouraging  to  hear  the  President
mention the steps  that  will  be  pursued  regarding  employment,  and  the
training and promotion of small and medium enterprises.

Azapo, however, believes that the problem of joblessness is far bigger  than
can be resolved by the programme  of  human  resource  development  and  the
creation of an enabling environment for  SMMEs.  It  is  our  view  that  we
should also train people to become job creators themselves, and also  engage
in a vigorous rural development  strategy  aiming  at  creating  sustainable
jobs in rural areas.

In a country such as South Africa, where the majority  of  our  people  were
denied opportunities  to  acquire  skills,  the  unskilled  should  also  be
afforded an opportunity to work and improve the condition  of  their  lives.
It is not their fault that they were denied the opportunity to  acquire  the
skills. To  Azapo,  a  rural  and  urban  renewal  development  strategy  by
Government can go a long way in assisting the unemployed get jobs.
As we speak, skilled teachers and graduates are jobless. The truth  is  that
the formal employment sector is unwilling to  employ  them.  Azapo  believes
that the time has come for an effective and co-ordinated Reconstruction  and
Development Programmme in rural areas. As we  are  preparing  to  start  the
2003 legislative programme, we therefore have  a  responsibility  to  direct
resources towards the upliftment of the poor in our country.

Allow me to add Azapo's voice to the many voices in South Africa and in  the
world that are shouting against the US and the  United  Kingdom's  intention
to wage war against Iraq. Azapo is opposed to war, whether waged by  the  US
or Britain, or whether waged through the auspices  of  the  United  Nations.
War is war, and it is devastating.

The acceptance by Iraq of our country's offer to send a team of  scientists,
engineers, technicians and other experts to share with Iraq  South  Africa's
expertise in eliminating weapons of mass destruction is indeed a  plus,  not
only  for  ourselves  but  for  Africa  as  a  whole.  Our  country's  peace
initiatives in Africa and  in  Iraq  are  matters  that  Azapo  unreservedly
supports.

While listening carefully to  the  speech  by  the  hon  President,  we  are
encouraged by Government's intentions to increase social  grants.  Our  view
has, however, been that social  grants  by  themselves  cannot  resolve  the
issue of poverty, and at times they are misused. The intention to train  and
empower community development  practitioners  touches  our  hearts  greatly.
This is an area that has been neglected and which was left only to NGOs  and
related bodies. Direct Government involvement in this area is long  overdue,
but there are some factors  that  may  militate  against  delivery  in  this
sphere of involvement.

Road infrastructure is at times nonexistent in remote areas of  our  country
where  community  development  practitioners  are  needed  most.   We   urge
Government to speed up road construction in rural areas.  Salaries  paid  to
community development practitioners, compared to those paid  for  Government
jobs, is another factor that discourages trained and dedicated personnel.

Last year we saw an improvement in land restitution cases,  but  these  were
cases largely related to  forced  removals.  Cases  relating  to  historical
claims, particularly in rural areas, still need to be resolved.  It  remains
to be seen how Government  will  deliver  on  this  front  of  our  people's
struggle. In order to deliver meaningful land  to  our  people,  we  suggest
that Government should also look at land that is lying fallow and land  that
is used for speculative purposes.

All  of  us  gathered  here  should  realise  that  when  we  attained   our
independence and freedom, we did so through the  mobilisation  of  the  poor
masses in the townships and in the rural areas. These are  the  same  people
who continue to vote for our different parties to  represent  them  in  this
Parliament. Just as their participation in  the  removal  of  apartheid  was
necessary, it is important that their participation in  the  improvement  of
their lives is enhanced by Government programmes.

People lose faith when they realise that those they have entrusted with  the
responsibility of changing their lives  are  no  longer  committed  to  this
goal. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr D H M GIBSON: Madam Speaker,  one  of  the  best  and  most  constructive
speeches from the Government's side during this debate was that of  the  hon
Derek Hanekom. He was balanced,  sensible  and  reasonable.  It  immediately
became apparent why he was thrown out of the Cabinet,  because  the  way  to
favour in the ANC is namely to spout hot  air,  to  come  up  with  ignorant
nonsense, to reconstruct reality, to be paranoid or to suck up to the  boss.
[Interjections.]

What a pity it was that we had to listen to the talented Minister  of  Wind,
the hon Minister Asmal, wasting his 15 minutes  on  verbal  histrionics.  He
set out to entertain us, and that he did. What a  shame  that  he  dealt  so
perfunctorily with his subject, which is education. He failed completely  to
tell us why, with a relatively static school population,  he  and  the  MECs
who follow his policies fail to provide quality education for our  children.
Tens of thousands of young people  emerge  from  our  schools  with  school-
leaving certificates which equip  them  for  nothing  other  than  permanent
unemployment.

While at school, too many of our children still  occupy  schools  which  are
grossly overcrowded and hopelessly inadequate. Come and visit  me  in  Ivory
Park, in Ebony Park, in Diepsloot and in  Kaalfontein  ...  [Interjections.]
Oh, no. You were there for 10 minutes. Come and see the terrible  conditions
which are caused by the lack of planning, the  lack  of  foresight  and  the
lack of co-ordination  by  your  department  and  those  for  whom  you  are
responsible.

And what about the Minister of Housing?  She  talked  at  length  here.  Why
doesn't she talk instead to the housing MECs and the education  authorities?
Instead of planning together in a sensible manner, they  all  do  their  own
thing. The result is that houses  are  built  and  then  occupied  by  young
parents without anyone thinking that schools,  clinics  and  playing  fields
must be built simultaneously with the erection of houses, instead of  making
people wait five, 10 or 15 years for the ordinary amenities of life.

And what about the Minister  of  Sport  and  Recreation?  Thank  heavens  we
didn't have him  participating,  but  I  would  like  to  ask  him  to  stop
interfering in sport and to do something about the  lack  of  sports  fields
for our children. You can travel the length and breadth of my  province  and
you will find hardly a soccer field  at  our  township  schools;  almost  no
cricket fields; no rugby fields; no swimming pools. [Interjections.] How  do
we expect our children to compete on merit when we don't equip  them  to  do
so?

Then, Government statements too often seem aimed at  harming  South  Africa.
We have a situation in which people  like  the  hon  Deputy  Minister  Pahad
accuses us of being clowns, windbags and un-South African.  [Interjections.]
I want to throw that right back at that hon Deputy Minister, by saying  that
he and his ilk actively undermine the  interests  of  South  Africa  in  the
world. [Interjections.] He is responsible for a lot of what goes on.  It  is
quite remarkable the damage which he and his Minister do  to  this  country.
[Interjections.]

We have the hon Pallo Jordan sitting over there. He wants peace. Now all  of
us want peace, and the point I would like to make  is  that  if  the  United
Nations had not forced Saddam Hussein to start complying, he would not  have
complied. [Interjections.]

What we should be doing is using our troops in the streets, which  march  on
the American embassy, to march on the Iraqi embassy as well  to  prove  that
we are not anti-American. [Interjections.] Show  a  little  even-handedness.
There will be no war if Mr Saddam Hussein complies with the  UN.  It  is  as
simple as that. [Interjections.]

The way to find favour in the ANC seems  to  be  by  making  ridiculous  and
extravagant attacks on our natural friends  and  allies  and  embracing  the
pariahs and dictators of the world.  Sometimes  ANC  statements  sound  like
loony tunes, but nobody in Government seems to care or listen - not even  to
their partners.

Poor dear Boy Geldenhuys, that nice man, complained  to  Rapport  some  time
ago that ``Die ANC luister nie na ons nie.''  [The  ANC  doesn't  listen  to
us.] In one stroke he destroyed the  basis  for  the  participation  of  his
party and his leader in Government, because the whole basis of it  was  that
they were going to ... [Interjections.] I cannot  answer  the  hon  member's
question now. [Interjections.]

They wanted to co-operate in governance at every level, because the  New  NP
was going to influence  these  people  here  to  follow  sensible  policies.
[Interjections.] We heard the hon  Dr  Geldenhuys  compare  President  Thabo
Mbeki to the prophet Jonah, who lay sleeping calmly in the hold of  a  great
ship as it rocked and rolled in a biblical storm.

Poor Boy forgot to say that if we were to read the story a  little  further,
we would find that shortly after the sailors found Jonah sleeping they  cast
ballots and threw him overboard.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  Perhaps  he
was warning the President that if he continued  to  sleep  on  some  of  the
important matters in South Africa, while the  storm  rages  about  him,  the
voters will throw him overboard into the deep. [Interjections.]

Then we had the  hon  Renier  Schoeman  participating.  That  was  the  only
participation from our Health Ministry. You  would  have  thought  that  the
Deputy Minister of Health would  have  stormed  in  to  tell  us  about  the
influence he is exercising on  health  and  Aids  policy  in  South  Africa,
instead of which he said not a single word about  health  in  this  country,
nor did his quiet Minister sitting over there. Not one word.

That means he has no influence over health policy. That is probably just  as
well, knowing him. The price of the motor car  and  the  bodyguard  and  the
cocktail party invitations to keep one's mouth shut can't be  ignored.  From
being Rasputin, that hon Deputy Minister of Health has become  a  figure  of
derision.

Why does the  President  let  Minister  Tshabalala-Msimang  say  such  silly
things? She thinks that, without our submarines, the  Americans  may  invade
South  Africa.  Why  does  Smuts  Ngonyama  get  away  with   making   silly
statements, such as that importing cheap Aids drugs ``may open  our  country
up to biological warfare''? That same man describes the  case  presented  by
US Secretary of State Colin Powell, not  as  unconvincing  or  one  that  he
doesn't like, but as ``irrelevant'' and as a ``fabrication''.

Mr Kgalema Motlante says that America might invade South Africa to  get  our
platinum. This is the sort of voice that comes out of  the  Government  that
you represent. [Interjections.] That is why I say they are loony tunes.  Why
do they get away with it, and do they think they are serving South  Africa's
interests while making statements like that? [Interjections.]

The President himself accused Britain and Australia  of  fabricating  travel
reports so that they could destroy the World Cup being  held  by  Africa.  I
want to warn that there is a price to pay for every bit  of  verbal  excess,
for every bit  of  support  for  the  Gaddafis  and  for  every  incautious,
ridiculous and ignorant statement. That price comes in the form  of  reduced
influence where it counts, and of reduced access.
I predict that some of our ambassadors  may  well  find  that,  rather  than
being able to promote and advance South Africa's interests,  they  will  not
have real access to the most important  decision-makers  in  key  countries.
[Interjections.] They will be treated  courteously,  but  will  be  given  a
brush-off to the detriment of our country and to  the  detriment  of  Africa
that we all love. [Interjections.]

We should be serving South Africa  and  serving  South  Africa's  interests,
instead of which we walk around and run around and demonstrate  and  support
the very people who should be put in their place in the  world  -  the  very
people who are ensuring that Africa doesn't get the  support  and  attention
it deserves. [Interjections.] If you are happy with that, we  certainly  are
not in my party, and the people of South Africa  are  also  not  happy  with
what you are doing and the brand of government that you're failing to  give.
[Interjections.] [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr J H JEFFERY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon president,  hon  Deputy  President
and hon members, in his speech to us at Fernwood on  Friday  night  the  hon
Gibson  told  us  about  how  part  of   his   brain   had   been   removed.
[Interjections.] After listening  to  his  speech,  I  can  understand  why.
[Laughter.]
In his state of the nation address to both Houses of Parliament  on  Friday,
the President spoke about Government intensifying its offensive against  the
cancer of corruption within the Public Service. This statement  follows  the
January 8 statement of  the  ANC  National  Executive  Committee,  in  which
branches of the ANC were urged to remain vigilant  and  act  firmly  against
the cancer of corruption and to  create  the  possibility  for  united  mass
action against corruption. This also follows a comprehensive  resolution  on
anticorruption adopted at the ANC's 51st  national  conference  in  December
last year.

The ANC-led Government has indeed taken great strides in the  fight  against
corruption. There can be no comparison between  the  institutions  in  place
and the steps being taken now to confront corruption and the position  prior
to the ANC taking power nine years ago.

On the  institutional  front,  our  Constitution  provides  for  independent
institutions such as the  Auditor-General,  the  Public  Protector  and  the
Public Service  Commission.  Additional  bodies  established  to  deal  with
corruption include the  Independent  Complaints  Directorate,  the  National
Prosecuting Authority and a number of structures comprising both members  of
the SAPS and prosecuting authorities.

On the legislative front, the Public Finance Management Act has  transformed
the controls over the spending of public money, and made the prevention  and
detection of corruption in this sector a  lot  easier.  Parliament,  as  hon
members  are  aware,  is  currently  finalising  similar  legislation  at  a
municipal level. The Protected Disclosures Act provides for  the  protection
of whistle-blowers.

Government has also  developed  a  national  programme  against  corruption,
which culminated in the establishment of the National  Anticorruption  Forum
in June 2001 and the adoption of the Public Service Anticorruption  Strategy
in January of last year. Finally, a number of anticorruption hot lines  have
been established by national departments and provincial governments.

It must be recognised that corruption is not  just  limited  to  the  Public
Service. It is not just the public servant who demands a bribe before he  or
she will perform a certain function. A crucial participant is the member  of
the public who is prepared to  pay  the  bribe.  It  is  also  the  ordinary
citizen who tries to  claim  social  grants  to  which  he  or  she  is  not
entitled. As we know, corruption is also prevalent in the private sector.

Our  efforts  to  combat  corruption  must  also  address  the  scourge   of
corruption in civil society. The moral regeneration movement will  hopefully
create a culture in which corruption in civil society is not tolerated.

Measuring the extent of  corruption  seems  to  be  difficult.  Transparency
International, for example, rates countries, but does so on  the  degree  to
which  corruption  is  perceived  to  exist  amongst  public  officials  and
politicians. Whilst in no way denying that  corruption  exists,  perceptions
are not necessarily that accurate. A recent survey, for example, found  that
a staggering 80% of its sample contended that there was a lot of  corruption
in South Africa, However, the National Victim  Survey  in  1998  found  that
only 2% of individuals had actually experienced corruption.

We need  to  be  careful  that  we  do  not  overexaggerate  the  extent  of
corruption in our country, and I hope the  hon  members  on  that  side  are
listening. The press has an important role to play in  exposing  corruption,
but  needs  to  be  careful  not  to   oversensationalise   allegations   of
corruption. It goes without  saying  that  allegations  of  corruption  sell
newspapers. Newspapers often outdo each other to see who can make  the  most
of a particular allegation. The same set of facts at  the  press's  disposal
sometimes gets recycled, but with a different spin to make it seem as if  it
is breaking news.

In this regard the  J P  Landman  and  Associates  study  makes  interesting
reading. The study focused on  newspaper  reports  of  corruption  in  South
Africa from November 2000 until  December  2001.  One  of  the  issues  they
looked at was which agent was responsible for bringing corruption  into  the
public sphere. They found that in this period  the  overwhelming  number  of
cases, 60,2%, were exposed through official Government  processes  and  that
investigations by journalists exposed a mere 8%.

We might think, particularly hon members on my  left,  that  there  is  more
corruption now. But, as speakers have stated earlier in this debate,  it  is
because the workings of Government are far more transparent than  they  have
ever been. Have we forgotten what it was like before 1994? [Interjections.]

Corruption is a crime. Let us not  forget  that  a  person's  guilt  is  not
determined by what one finds on the pages of  a  newspaper,  no  matter  how
sensationally a story may be written. The only institution that  can  decide
whether a person is guilty of corruption are the courts. They  can  only  do
this,  hon  Taljaard,  after  hearing,  examining  and  evaluating  all  the
evidence against the person accused. [Interjections.] And even then,  it  is
only after the  accused  has  had  the  opportunity  to  defend  himself  or
herself.  I  am  surprised  that  you  seem  to  have  forgotten  the   DA's
experiences with Mr Harksen. [Interjections.]

It  is  these  practices  that   define   us   as   a   civilised   society.
[Interjections.] That is precisely the point. We do not tolerate lynch  mobs
whipping up emotions and dispensing  instant  justice  to  those  that  they
suspect. It is  easy  to  make  allegations,  but  much  more  difficult  to
substantiate them so that the evidence stands up to legal scrutiny.

I would like to remind the House of a motion brought by the hon Schoeman  on
21 October 1997, which started with the words: ``The House, taking  note  of
the increasing occurrence of nepotism in Government ...''.

It went on  to  request  that  the  Public  Protector  investigate  specific
allegations of nepotism. The Public Protector did investigate.  His  report,
No 11 of 1999, was tabled in this House. In his report the Public  Protector
stated: ``From the investigation by my office of the complaint  of  nepotism
by the NP'' - they were still the NP at that stage - ``I could not find  one
instance where such an allegation could be justified.''

The press is very powerful in determining public opinion, but  it  must  use
its influence responsibly. A case in point is that  of  baby  Tshepang.  Six
men were arrested for her rape. The newspapers showed us pictures  of  these
men. From the angle the pictures were taken, you  could  well  believe  that
these men were capable of committing such a horrible crime.  But  they  were
innocent. The forensic evidence did not support  the  charges  against  them
and they were released.  Another  man  was  arrested  and  eventually  found
guilty of the crime. After their  release  the  press  showed  us  different
pictures of these men, pictures of them with their families  in  which  they
looked like normal human beings.

The  whistle-blowers  Act,  the  Protected   Disclosures   Act,   encourages
reporting  to  bodies  that  will  ensure  that  allegations  are   properly
investigated. Protection of people who leak  information  to  the  press  is
only given  in  very  serious  cases,  or  when  earlier  reporting  to  the
responsible bodies has not yielded results.

The press needs to be careful that  it  does  not  become  the  conveyor  of
sensational allegations that are being leaked to it for  other  reasons.  In
receiving such allegations, journalists need to ask themselves  whether  the
source referred the matter to investigators and, if not, why not.

The arms procurement process is a case in point.  It  has  been  dubbed  the
``arms scandal'' by many newspapers, but any facts  pointing  to  a  scandal
have yet to surface. I quote Jethro Goko, deputy  editor  of  Business  Day,
who said in an article published last Friday:


  I have so far not been convinced, judging by what has  come  out  in  the
  public domain, that  there  is  much  overwhelming  evidence  that  South
  Africa's multi-billion rand arms  procurement  package  was  fatally  and
  comprehensively flawed by large-scale corruption in Government.

We must not lose sight of the fact that the strategic  defence  package  was
unique in South Africa. It was the first time that such a  package  approach
to the acquisition of armaments was adopted. Owing to the sanctions  imposed
on the acquisition of arms prior to 1994, an adequate acquisition policy  to
accommodate the procurement of armaments  for  the  SANDF  on  international
markets did not exist. It had never been done before.

Government also took steps to ensure that corruption did not  occur  in  the
deal. But when the allegations starting surfacing, it was  Government  which
took the steps to have the matter investigated.

Hon members are reminded that the Joint  Investigating  Team  report,  which
was presented to Parliament on 14 November 2001, found no  evidence  of  any
improper or unlawful conduct by Government.  The  report  did  outline  that
certain areas of investigation would continue into specific matters  by  the
National Director of Public Prosecutions.

One of these areas was that of the hon Tony  Yengeni,  who  has  been  found
guilty of defrauding Parliament by not disclosing a discount he received  on
his motor vehicle. The prejudice to Parliament was that its  image  and  the
public's trust in the institution were tainted. I know that some of the  hon
members here were disappointed that he was not found  guilty  of  corruption
and, specifically, of unduly influencing the arms procurement  process.  But
he was never actually charged with this. The charge of corruption, on  which
he  was  acquitted,  was  that  he  received  a  benefit  not  legally  due;
alternatively, that he pretended that he would use his powers  to  influence
the arms acquisition.

The hon Holomisa, who is not in the House right now, demanded in his  speech
yesterday that the President explain to the nation the  application  of  the
plea-bargaining mechanism. He was quoted in last Friday's The Star as  being
``outraged'' at the  plea-bargain  procedure  which  resulted  in  Yengeni's
acquittal on the main charge of corruption. He went on to say: ``We  are  of
the view that a fair trial where the merits of the case could be  heard  and
where the truth could be exposed did not take place.''

I am not sure how the President will respond, but hon Holomisa, as a  member
of the justice committee which passed that Bill,  let  me  remind  you  that
this House passed the plea-bargaining law - that was the Criminal  Procedure
Second Amendment Bill - on 2 November 2001.

The amendments relating to plea-bargaining  were  proposed  by  the  SA  Law
Commission and  were  designed  to  simplify  and  streamline  the  criminal
justice system by allowing plea bargaining  to  take  place,  amongst  other
instances, in cases in which the state may have difficulty  in  proving  all
the charges.

I would like to refer the hon Holomisa to the debate in Hansard  in  columns
7466 to 7475 of 2001, where he may find information to this effect, and,  in
particular, he should read the speech of his own hon member,  the  hon  J  T
Maseka, who supported the Bill. That speech is in column 7471.

The hon Holomisa also needs to be reminded that the  decision  to  accept  a
plea bargain is that of the prosecutor who, in terms of section 179  of  the
Constitution, exercises  his  or  her  functions  without  fear,  favour  or
prejudice. I know, however, that reading Hansard or constitutions  may  well
be documents that a  serial  coup  leader  does  not  read  that  carefully.
[Laughter.]

Let us intensify our fight against the cancer of corruption. Let  us  ensure
that those involved in corruption are brought to book. But let us do  it  in
such a way that ensures that the due process of law is followed, and let  us
not use wild allegations for cheap party  politicking  in  a  way  that  may
destroy  the  reputations  of  people  who  may  be  innocent.  Thank   you.
[Applause.]

Ms S C VOS: Madam Deputy Speaker, Mr President, Mr Deputy President and  hon
colleagues, the President of  the  IFP,  Prince  Mangosuthu  Buthelezi,  has
already eloquently articulated and demonstrated the important substance  and
the constructive tone our party desired be reflected in  this  debate  on  a
range of critical issues.

I will now attempt to contribute in another direction  and  to  continue  on
the nation-building theme that my  colleague  the  hon  Deputy  Minister  of
Public Works has already begun.
The IFP has long been concerned about the social contract  that  we  believe
should exist between this Government, and any  future  government  for  that
matter, and the citizens of this country. We have heard much about  delivery
and our sincere collective determination to  generally  empower  and  uplift
the men, women and youth of our land. The myriad of details are well known.

This House has been a veritable ``marketplace  of  ideas'',  as  the  saying
goes, and the cut and thrust of this debate has brought  to  the  fore  grim
truths, wishful thinking and essential practicalities.

The obligations and responsibilities of  Government  are  well  known.  Your
address to this nation, Mr President, has  been  generally  described  as  a
balanced workmanlike approach to many of  the  issues  that  we  all  accept
require our urgent attention in one way or another.

However, we have heard very little in this debate about what we surely  have
a right to expect in return from  the  recipients  of  these  labours.  Why?
Should we not consider whether we are too defensive about and make too  many
excuses for the indolents who stalk our street  corners?  Are  we  for  some
reason too scared to put the boot on the other  foot  and  to  start  making
some reasonable reciprocal demands of our own from the voters who placed  us
in power?

I know that in the past we have  all  asked  nicely  for  co-operation,  for
goodwill, for that helping hand that would have made all the  difference  in
so many ways. But let us, for a  change,  concentrate  on  what  others  are
doing to help us help them. Has a meaningful ethos of  self-help  and  self-
reliance permeated into our homes and schools and all the  other  structures
of our society? How many parents, learners and teachers help, for  instance,
to clean and do what they can to  maintain  our  schools?  Why  is  this  an
exception and not a norm?

Has an ethos of self-help permeated? This is a question that is critical  to
our social  development.  Do  the  majority  of  persons  in  possession  of
relevant information about  criminal  activities  in  our  communities  come
forward? We know the answer to that.

As a simple example, do the majority of  persons  across  our  socioeconomic
divide bother to rally to entreaties to simply pick up and  dispose  of  the
litter that pollutes their immediate environments? We  know  the  answer  to
that too. Do they bother to help the aged and the  infirm  in  whatever  way
they can and merely give of their time, which would mean so much? Why do  so
many with the capacity not willingly give of their expertise to mentor,  for
example, students, and assist NGOs and charities in need? Why do so many  of
our drivers continue to recklessly  kill  and  maim  when  public  awareness
campaigns surely, by now, should have had some impact?

Too many families conceal women and child abuse which, apart from  sickening
physical  violence,  also  includes  the  irresponsible,  arrogant,  furtive
attempts by some parents, usually men - we  know  for  a  fact  -  to  avoid
paying child maintenance. The demands for billions  of  rand  in  Government
and social welfare programmes would, no  doubt,  halve  over  time  if  this
Government got really tough on parents  who  deliberately  renege  on  their
obligations and their responsibilities as parents.

The usual community stalwarts and the silent majority of stalwarts  give  of
themselves time and again. We obviously  must  not  deny  their  outstanding
contributions, and it is hoped that they are aware of our gratitude.
There are indications that some are  slowly  recognising  the  necessity  of
helping us to help them. Minister Maduna spoke passionately of reduction  in
crime thanks to community involvement in  certain  instances,  and  that  is
wonderful. But how can we get this ball rolling?

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Deputy Speaker, may I ask the House on that side,  who
requested earlier on that their speakers be heard, to allow our  speaker  to
be heard, please. [Interjections.]

Ms S C VOS: Should South Africa be any different from most countries in  the
world  where  democratically  elected  governments  not  only  expect,   but
actually demand, codes of conduct and, where possible, the  active  positive
participation of their electorates in the implementation of  their  policies
and programmes?

Is it not time we faced the  truth  that  we  are  cursed  by  the  outdated
attitudes of entitlement, which have long passed the  sell-by  date  of  the
politics of the struggle for liberation? Isn't it time for some tough  talk,
coupled with encouragement? Enlightened self-interest is  always  a  winning
ticket.
We must face the unpleasant  fact  that  the  very  persons  we  attempt  to
diligently serve can, in  the  final  analysis,  either  contribute  to  the
positive growth of our nation or, at every turn, tear  away  and  ultimately
destroy the fragile fabric of our society, no matter  what  this  Government
or any future government does for them. Thank you. [Applause.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker,  hon  President,
hon Deputy President, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,  there  have  been
varied responses to the state of the nation address by the President of  the
Republic of South Africa. It has generated a frenzy of discussions  in  many
sectors of our country.  Some  have  commended  the  President,  citing  his
amazing insight into major issues and challenges facing our  country  today.
Others  have  disagreed,  pointing  out  that  the  President  should   have
emphasised or elaborated on certain points or de-emphasised others.

The SA Human Rights Commission, for instance, in its response  says,  and  I
quote:


  The SA  Human  Rights  Commission  is  pleased  with  the  commitment  to
  alleviate poverty as expressed by the President of the Republic of  South
  Africa in his opening speech today in Parliament.

It goes on to point out, and I quote:


  Whilst  the  country  has  made  strides  towards  consolidation  of  our
  democracy, poverty alleviation remains an issue that needs  constructive,
  workable and implementable strategies.

The Minister of Home  Affairs  and  President  of  the  IFP,  Dr  Mangosothu
Buthelezi, said in his speech yesterday, and I quote:


  Undoubtedly enormous progress has been  achieved  in  a  multiplicity  of
  fields and endeavours undertaken by our Government.

He went on to say, and I quote again:


  Our  Government  has  performed  well  across  the  board  of  many  line
  functions. Delivery has increased, and this year we are doing better than
  last year and are set to see next  year  improving  on  today's  results.
  Therefore there is much call for satisfaction and comfort.

Dr Buthelezi further implored us to  focus  attention  on  the  work  ahead,
which must now reach out for the proverbial extra mile.

There are also those who have sought to position themselves on  the  extreme
end of opposition - those who have  unashamedly  sought  to  make  political
gains out of a grave  situation  facing  especially  the  developing  world.
Take, for instance, the Leader of the Opposition. This is how he  opens  his
speech, and I quote:


  We must change South Africa and we can.

Visibly play-acting he continues, and I quote:


  We are watching one of the most extraordinary calamities in human history
  - the wiping out of millions of people, in peacetime, by  a  known  cause
  that has a known treatment.

In this context we must then ask what message is the  phrase  ``that  has  a
known treatment'' meant to convey? According to the Cambridge  International
Dictionary of English, the 1996 edition, to ``treat'', in medical terms,  is
to use drugs, exercises, etc, in order to cure a  person  of  a  disease  or
heal an injury.

So why are we creating false impressions for our people? First and  foremost
the message  that  needs  to  be  put  across  to  our  people  clearly  and
unambiguously is that there is no cure for the known cause  referred  to  by
the hon member. [Interjections.]  More  importantly,  the  Government  that,
according  to  some,  is  said  to  lack  political  courage,  has  actually
committed  itself  to  the  implementation  of  Government's   comprehensive
strategy on HIV and Aids. The  President  specifically  pronounced  on  this
issue, adding, and I quote:


  This includes implementation  of  the  decisions  of  the  Constitutional
  Court.

However, the most intriguing aspect of this issue is that  those  who  claim
to love our people so much that they do not want to  be  ``witness  to  mass
death'', as they put it, do not emphatically tell the people they  claim  to
love so much, firstly, that because there  is  no  cure  for  HIV/Aids,  the
first line of defence is prevention; secondly, that  in  the  fight  against
HIV and Aids, the struggle for clean water needs to be  intensified  as  the
use of contaminated  water  acts  directly  to  cause  disease  by  carrying
microbes and worms that cause repeated  infections  and  weaken  the  immune
system through exhaustion, exacerbating conditions such  as  Aids;  thirdly,
that in the fight against HIV/Aids, people infected with  the  disease  must
be treated as human beings with all the rights of  equal  citizens  of  this
country; and, fourthly, that the drugs we supply to people living  with  the
disease are suitable for consumption, are of  a  world-class  standard  and,
more importantly, are to be made affordable to our people. They also do  not
tell our people that, as Dr Buthelezi put it yesterday, ``Especially in  the
dark age of HIV/Aids, a heathy diet is essential''.

The people that claim to love us, that proclaim their love for  our  people,
are luring all of us  into  the  grave.  They  de-emphasise  prevention  and
profile treatment highly. What is likely to happen, in this case, is that  a
psychological state of normality is created. It is as  if  we  we  can  live
normally and there is no problem. A false hope  is  created  to  the  effect
that should a problem arise, there will be treatment.

If one may ask, why is this being done? Why are we being  so  irresponsible?
Why are we being lured into the grave? [Interjections.] In  this  regard  it
is also relevant to remember one incident that took place in this House.  We
moved a motion of condolence on  the  passing  away  of  one  of  our  youth
leaders. Before we could state the cause of death, a  member  of  the  party
that claims to love our people said, in a jolly good  manner,  ``Aids!''  We
protested at this and the member in question was  asked  to  apologise.  The
youth leader in question had lost his life in a car accident.

That, however, is not the point. The issue is what kind of  people  we  have
here - the sort of people who laugh over a dead person's  body.  They  claim
to love our people when they are alive, but laugh  at  them  when  they  are
dead. What morality is this? [Applause.]

The picture has  successfully  been  painted  among  some  sections  of  our
community that the Government, and the ANC in particular, does not care  for
the lives of the citizens of this country. In  this  regard,  let  me  steal
again from the words of one of the elders of this House who happens  not  to
be a member of the ANC, namely Dr Buthelezi.  Speaking  about  this  problem
yesterday he said, and I quote:


  As a Minister in Government I know how much our Government  is  doing  to
  face up to this pandemic.

Yet the hon Leon continues to say that life is no better now  than  it  was.
Let us just remind the hon member that before the time we are living in  now
there was apartheid, a crime against humanity ...  [Interjections]  ...  one
of the most savage political systems the world has ever seen. So if  we  are
to be informed by his statement, we must conclude  that  for  him  apartheid
was better than the new, democratic South Africa. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE LARGEST MINORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker, on a point  of
order: The hon Chief Whip, with respect, is misquoting  the  hon  Leader  of
the Opposition. [Interjections.] He is misquoting  him,  and  he  must  know
that he is misquoting him because the speech is available. [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! No, hon member, actually that is not a point  of  order.
In actual fact I think he was paraphrasing what he believes the  hon  member
was saying. [Interjections.] It was not  really  a  quotation.  Please  take
your seat, hon Gibson. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: One must  actually  say  that  hearing
this from him is actually a relief for two reasons. The first  is  that  his
opening declaration, ``we must change South  Africa,''  can  now  be  better
understood  as  to  the  direction  that  he  is  actually   yearning   for.
[Interjections.] Secondly, many who have suspected this sort of  thing  from
him are now clarified.

The hon member Raenette Taljaard asked the President, and I quote:


  Mr President, we have every right to ask  you  today:  What  values  will
  define us? What moral renewal edifice will we build with  foundations  of
  quicksand? We have had at least three Cabinet Ministers implicated and/or
  under investigation for suspected  corruption  in  South  Africa's  first
  decade of freedom.

Then, of course, she continues to name the persons in her mini-story.

One would have liked to take issue with many of the  points  raised  in  the
contents thereof.  For  instance,  what  is  specifically  meant  by  ``with
foundations of quicksand''? Also,  why  is  the  phrase  ``first  decade  of
freedom'' in her speech written in inverted commas?  [Interjections.]  Could
it possibly mean that whilst she is a democrat, judging by the name  of  her
party, she does not, however, identify with  the  democratic  phase  of  our
history? Intriguing, is it not? However, be that as it may, the  content  of
her question is actually a small matter. The  broad  question  that  we  all
have to address ourselves  is  corruption  as  a  broad  issue  facing  this
nation.

For our young South African member of Parliament a few short stories  should
illuminate this issue. On 1 September 1963 Bellington Mampe  died  while  in
detention. On 9 September 1964 Suliman Saloojee fell out of a seventh  floor
window, we were told. He was also in detention.  On  5  February  1982  Neil
Aggett hanged himself while in detention. For these murders  and  many  more
no one was ever investigated, let alone the question  of  an  arrest.  This,
hon member, is our past. [Interjections.]

Today South Africans of whatever standing have the law  above  them  and  no
one above it. Looking back at where we come from,  we  should  indeed  agree
with the President and many others who say  South  Africa  is  a  symbol  of
hope.

The very democratic constitutional and legal framework that we have  set  up
represents, comprehensively understood, our determination  as  a  nation  to
prosper and  our  collective  rejection  of  all  that  is  evil,  including
corruption.

Finally, we want to end by posing the following question. The  question  is:
Who will benefit from black economic  empowerment?  While  we  are  thinking
about the answer, which, to some of us, looks so obvious, I want to read  to
you a quotation from Barbara Kingsolver's  novel  The  Poisonwood  Bible.  I
must also declare: Comrade Sue, I still have to  return  your  book  by  the
way. [Laughter.] It goes like this:


  You'll say I walked across Africa with my wrists unshackled, and now I am
  one more soul walking free in a white skin, wearing some  thread  of  the
  stolen goods: cotton or diamonds, freedom at the very least,  prosperity.
  Some of us know how we came by our fortune, and some of us don't, but  we
  wear it all the same. There's only one question worth asking now: How  do
  we aim to live with it?

[Applause.]

Mr D M BAKKER: Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, vir die agbare  Delport  en  Gibson
wil ek in die woorde van Tony Blair sê: [Madam Deputy Speaker, I would  like
to quote the following words of Tony Blair to the hon Delport  and  Gibson:]
``Old baggage discarded, new thinking required''. [Interjections.]

Some opposition parties  and  commentators'  reactions  to  the  President's
address sounded more empty-headed, than  open-minded.  They  criticised  for
what was not said, but failed to recognise the importance of the  vision  of
moderate politics and the President's priorities for the future  which  were
spelt out in his address. [Interjections.]

In addressing unemployment and the eradication of  poverty  and  inequality,
the President has been greeted by a fight-back approach  saying  the  nation
is strong. As long as we have high levels of  poverty  there  will  be  high
levels of crime and malnutrition, and the nation will not be fine.

The critics expected  great  innovation,  but  their  only  contribution  is
limited to the new  election  slogan  of  ``Fight  back  for  the  winds  of
change''. The leader of the opposition claims that  the  future  belongs  to
the opposition, but unfortunately he doesn't  know  the  difference  between
opposition and arrogance. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

The  way  in  which  speech  writers,  spin  doctors,  organisers,  regional
chairpersons and councillors desert  his  party,  while  he  is  wining  and
dining with Harksen,  says  it  all.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  The  FF
supporters might just find the DA-DP  too  far  right  wing  for  their  own
liking. [Interjections.]

By contrast, the hon Dr Buthelezi  said  that  he  speaks  to  motivate  and
stimulate progress in the right  direction.  He  critically  took  stock  of
where our beloved country is, and there are indeed  several  aspects  to  be
critical about. The hon President has heard it  all,  and  specifically  all
the concerns regarding Zimbabwe and HIV/Aids.

Die uitfasering van die kommandostelsel,  sonder  duidelikheid  oor  presies
wat dit gaan opvolg, wek groot kommer. Ongelukkig bestaan die indruk dat  'n
paar  vrot  appels  die  pak  versuur.  Juis  hierdie   vrot-appel-persepsie
illustreer  die  absolute  noodsaaklikheid  om  die   verdelings   van   ons
geskiedenis  te  oorbrug  en  'n  fondament  te  bou  vir  die  fundamentele
herskikking van die Suid-Afrikaanse politiek. Ons moet  'n  samelewing  skep
waarin alle Suid-Afrikaners glo hulle 'n belang  het  en  waarvoor  daar  'n
gemeenskaplike lojaliteit en patriotisme bestaan, en dit  is  die  grondslag
van ons ooreenkoms met die ANC.

Ons  moet  aan  alle  Suid-Afrikaners  hoop  gee  vir   die   toekoms   deur
konstruktiewe dialoog en deelname aan besluitneming. Ons glo in  Suid-Afrika
en stel Suid-Afrika eerste, anders as die agbare leier  van  die  opposisie.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Daarom kan ons nie gedeeltelik  Suid-Afrikaners  wees  nie
en  kan  ons  nie  mooiweer  Suid-Afrikaners  wees  nie.   [Tussenwerpsels.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The phasing out of the commando system,  without  any  clarity  about  what
exactly will take its place, is cause for great concern. Unfortunately,  the
impression has been created that a few rotten apples are spoiling the  whole
barrel. Precisely this perception of rotten apples illustrates the  absolute
necessity  to  overcome  the  divisions  of  our  history  and  to  build  a
foundation for the fundamental reorganisation of South African politics.  We
must create a society in which all  South  Africans  believe  they  have  an
interest and for which there exist a  common  loyalty  and  patriotism,  and
that is the basis of our agreement with the ANC.

We must give all South Africans hope for  the  future  through  constructive
dialogue and participation in decision-making. We believe  in  South  Africa
and we put South Africa first, unlike the  hon  leader  of  the  opposition.
[Interjections.] Therefore, we cannot be  partial  South  Africans,  and  we
cannot be fair-weather South Africans either. [Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Can we have some order,  hon  members?  We  can't
have  running  commentary.  I  mean,  heckling  is  accepted,  but   running
commentary makes it difficult to hear the speaker.

Mr D M BAKKER: Of course we differ on the details and on emphasis placed  on
several issues, but it is not in our interests to run our own country  down.
There is so much that we can be proud of. I am a proud South African.

The truth about my country is that inflation is at the lowest it's  been  in
my lifetime. [Applause.] The truth is that  we  have  some  of  the  world's
cheapest electricity. Our banking sector is ranked in the top  10  in  terms
of competitiveness. We can actually drink water from  our  taps.  Ten  years
ago more than 64 countries had sports boycotts against us,  and  today  many
of them are competing  for  the  Cricket  World  Cup  in  our  own  country.
[Applause.]

The truth is our wines are internationally respected and  enjoyed,  and  the
Kruger National Park is the best of its kind. [Applause.] We  produce  BMWs,
Mercedes Benzes, Golfs and Jettas for  right-hand-drive  markets  throughout
the world.

The truth is our gold, diamonds and platinum, and our beaches  and  sunshine
are the envy of the world. [Applause.]  But  best  of  all,  we  have  warm,
friendly, innovative and vibrant people. [Applause.]

Mense soos wynboer Abrie Botha  van  Vredendal  wat  'n  ooreenkoms  met  sy
plaaswerkers het om 'n 30% aandeel in sy wingerd te bekom. Ryan  Kilian,  'n
elfjarige seun van Geduld, wat 14  kleuters  en  babas  uit  'n  bussie  red
tydens 'n gewapende roof. Sinenhlanhla Dlamini van Nongoma in  KwaZulu-Natal
wat ses onderskeidings in  matriek  verwerf  in  'n  skool  waar  daar  geen
elektrisiteit,  geen  lopende  water,  geen  biblioteek,  laboratoriums   of
rekenaars  is  nie.  [Applous.]  Mense  soos  Natalie   du   Toit   wie   se
vasberadenheid en gesindheid die hele wêreld geïnspireer het.

As 'n trotse Suid-Afrikaner glo ek en my party dat wit en  swart,  bruin  en
Indiër Suid-Afrikaners saam verantwoordelik is vir ons  toekoms.  [Applous.]
As trotse Suid-Afrikaners glo ons dat 'n gemeenskaplike patriotisme  in  die
politieke lewe net so belangrik is soos wat geloof in godsdiens is.

Ons weet dat rekonsiliasie en  die  ontwikkeling  van  ons  interpersoonlike
verhoudings 'n voorvereiste vir 'n vreedsame en nie-rassige  Suid-Afrikaanse
gemeenskap is. Trotse Suid-Afrikaners het 'n gemeenskaplike doelwit  om  die
uitdagings van ons tyd aan te spreek en saam oplossings te vind.

Ek is 'n trotse  Afrikaner.  Ek  is  'n  trotse  Suid-Afrikaner.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[People like  the  wine  farmer,  Abrie  Botha  of  Vredendal,  who  has  an
agreement with his farmworkers to acquire a 30% interest  in  his  vineyard.
Ryan Kilian, an eleven-year-old boy from Geduld, who saved 14  toddlers  and
babies from a minibus during an armed  robbery.  Sinenhlanhla  Dlamini  from
Nongoma in KwaZulu-Natal, who achieved  six  distinctions  in  matric  in  a
school where  there  is  no  electricity,  no  running  water,  no  library,
laboratories or computers. [Applause.]  People  such  as  Natalie  du  Toit,
whose determination and attitude inspired the whole world.

As a proud South African, my party and  I  believe  that  white  and  black,
coloured and Indian South Africans are jointly responsible for  our  future.
[Applause.] As proud South Africans we believe that a common  patriotism  in
political life is just as important as faith is in religion.
We know  that  reconciliation  and  the  development  of  our  interpersonal
relationships are prerequisites for a peaceful and nonracial  South  African
community. Proud South  Africans  have  a  common  goal  of  addressing  the
challenges of our time and of jointly finding solutions.

I am a proud Afrikaner. I am a proud South African. [Applause.]]

Mr B MTHEMBU: Madam Deputy Speaker ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: What is your point of order, hon member?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, is it in order for the  hon
Mr Lee to read a newspaper in the House? He's now putting it down.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: It is totally  out  of  order,  if  he  is  reading  the
newspaper in the House. [Interjections.]

Proceed, hon member.

Mr B MTHEMBU: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Comrade  President,  Comrade  Deputy
President, hon members and comrades, in 1994 we started the journey  towards
the ideal of a united, nonracial, democratic, peaceful and prosperous  South
Africa.

The  first  term  of  the  ANC-led  Government  saw   the   start   of   the
deconstruction of the apartheid colonial state and its  replacement  with  a
progressive constitutional  order  and,  as  a  consequence,  a  progressive
policy and legislative framework. Consistent with this,  we  were  given  an
overwhelming  endorsement  by  the  electorate  in  the  1999  elections  to
accelerate change for a better life for all. In  so  doing,  the  people  of
this country gave us  the  political  mandate  to  build  a  winning  nation
through an intensified offensive for reconstruction and development.

The ANC-led Government has remained unwavering and honest to the  commitment
it made to the people of South Africa, and we will continue to  advance  our
obligation of the creation of a better life for all our  people,  especially
the poor.

We have  a  political  mandate,  which  we  made  explicitly  clear  in  our
manifesto, that this Government will strive for world  peace  -  that  is  a
mandate. The majority of the people  of  this  country  have  endorsed  that
position. So we don't want people who come  in  through  the  back  door  to
preach war to this democracy.

The overarching strategy of our social programmes remains pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty, and eliminating economic  and  social  inequality  and
unemployment within the context of a growing economy and  in  support  of  a
macroeconomic framework. At  the  heart  of  our  social  programme  is  the
development of our people. This  entails  multidimensional  and  fundamental
structural changes in the social, economic, political and  cultural  sectors
of our society. This is central to our policies and is  non-negotiable,  and
requires change in popular attitudes and institutional arrangements.

For the record, since 1994 we have succeeded in  bringing  about  structural
changes in the education, health and welfare  systems.  At  present,  social
services account for 53,4% of the total Budget. The fact that  half  of  the
national Budget is invested in  social  development  and  human  capital  is
irrefutable proof of  our  commitment  to  breaking  the  vicious  cycle  of
poverty and underdevelopment. Surely,  this  must  be  proof  to  our  worst
critics - some present here today and elsewhere  -  that  we  are  the  only
party to lead the fight in enhancing the living  standards  of  our  people,
thus providing the basis for sustained growth and development?

Contrary to what the hon Leader of the Opposition says - that we spend  less
on our human resources - very few countries spend more than  half  of  their
total budgets on social infrastructure. This  is  what  the  Government  has
done as a commitment to the development of our  people,  because  we  are  a
people-centred Government. [Applause.]

In the second democratic dispensation, we committed ourselves  to  improving
the quality of education and the development of  our  human  resources.  The
urgency of producing an  educated  and  skilled  population  was  pronounced
clearly by our President in his state of the nation  address  to  Parliament
on 25 June 1999.

Characterising education and training as decisive drivers in our  effort  to
build a winning nation, he called for the mobilisation of the  energies  and
experiences of our people and the building of a new partnership based  on  a
commitment to building a better life for all.

The call by our President should be understood not only in  the  context  of
our country's entry into the global knowledge society at  the  turn  of  the
last century, but, more importantly, in the context of the deep  scars  left
by the legacy of  Bantu  Education  on  our  human  resources.  These  scars
manifest themselves profoundly in the education sector.

The painful history of statutory underfunding, and the crippling effects  of
job reservation and the colour bar on  skilled  development  have  prevented
our nation from being adequately prepared for the challenges of  the  global
knowledge society in  the  21st  century.  As  we  are  gathered  here,  the
destructive and enduring  consequences  of  apartheid  education  are  still
thwarting our efforts to transform our economy and the Public Service.

Yes, the injunction by our President was  given  life  with  the  launch  of
Tirisano by the Department of Education in  1999  in  terms  of  the  theme:
``Working together to build a South African education  and  training  system
for the 21st century.'' This five-year plan has as its strategic  focus  the
qualitative structural changes of our education system in order to meet  the
challenges of a global knowledge society.

The substantial  resources  that  have  been  invested  in  education  amply
demonstrate the commitment of our ANC-led  Government  to  developing  human
resources. Since  1994,  the  education  budget  has  increased  from  R31,8
billion to R59,8 billion in 2002. This constitutes 6%  of  our  GDP.  It  is
important to point out that 6% is the  international  standard  set  by  the
world body, Unesco.

Perhaps more significant, however, is  our  Government's  adherence  to  the
principle of a global Framework for Action, adopted in Dakar in 2000 by  the
World Education Forum, which reads as follows:


  No country seriously committed to basic education will be thwarted in the
  achievement of this goal by lack of resources.

As part of the process of reconstructing our  educational  system,  we  have
established the Human Resource Development Strategy, which was  released  in
April 2000 by the Ministries  of  Education  and  Labour.  The  master  plan
provides a  comprehensive  framework  that  addresses  inequalities  in  the
acquisition of skills  and  knowledge  in  order  to  improve  our  economic
productivity and international competitiveness.

Moreover, the process of setting up appropriate  institutional  arrangements
for skills development, in terms of the Skills Development Act of 1998,  has
been completed. In 2000 the  Skills  Development  Fund  was  introduced.  By
March 2000, 25 sector education and training authorities were  set  up,  and
by March 2001 all 25 Setas  had  already  submitted  their  sectors'  skills
plans for implementation in 2002. As our  President  said,  ``the  tide  has
turned''. We now need to take this tide at the flood very fast. [Applause.]

Last year we released  the  revised  curriculum  statement  for  Grade R  to
Grade 9 and the national curriculum for  Grade 10  to  Grade 12.  These  are
important achievements in the  ongoing  process  of  curriculum  reform.  We
believe that curriculum reform  is  at  the  heart  of  postapartheid  South
Africa since the school  system  we  inherited  was  at  variance  with  the
socioeconomic challenges of our country. Also,  as  our  country  is  moving
towards having a knowledge and skills-based economy  in  the  production  of
goods  and  services,  it  has  become  a  necessary  condition   that   our
educational structure correspond with the economic structure.

We are also  experiencing  a  shift  in  the  sectors  that  drive  economic
changes. As a consequence, our tertiary  sector's  activities  are  becoming
more  important  than  primary  and  secondary  sectors.  For  example,  the
tertiary sector's contribution to gross value added has grown  from  55%  in
1999 to 63% in 2001.

Accordingly, the curriculum changes that have been made through the  revised
curriculum statement seek to align the content of  our  school  system  with
the structural changes in  our  economy  and  the  values  embedded  in  our
Constitution. This is a  necessary  condition  to  achieve  the  demands  of
global competitiveness.

Much has been done by our Government, contrary to the view depicted that  we
have done nothing since 1999. We  are  on  course.  We  have  brought  about
necessary changes in our school system so that we are able  to  produce  the
necessary skills. [Applause.]

Similarly, the publication of  the  ``Manifesto  on  Values,  Education  and
Democracy'' by the Minister of Education in August 2001 augurs well for  the
integration  of  our  constitutional  values  into  an  emerging  democratic
education system such as ours.

Education is not only  a  process  of  the  transmission  of  knowledge  and
skills, but, equally important, it is a process of socialisation.  It  plays
an  important  role  in  generating  and  nurturing  values.  The  apartheid
education system, in the guise of Christian National  Education,  inculcated
the  values  of  racial  inferiority,  racism,  uncritical   acceptance   of
authority, obedience and conformity.

We were told that a black  child  was  not  fit  to  study  mathematics  and
science, hence the problem we are having at the moment. I  remember  at  one
institution where, if there were 300 students doing  course  1  of  science,
the lecturer would tell you, ``If I  have  10  in  course  3,  you  will  be
lucky''. That is the kind of system  we  come  from.  So  education  has  to
inculcate values that are consistent with our emerging democracy.

We have  also  made  progress  as  far  as  the  social  welfare  system  is
concerned. In the area of social security, we have  remained  steadfast  and
honest to the commitments we made in 1999. These include the realisation  of
comprehensive social security and extended  social  grant  coverage  through
targeting the most vulnerable groups, especially the poor, the disabled  and
the youth. We believe  that  targeting  ensures  that  only  the  needy  get
benefits.

We welcomed the announcement by the President that  Cabinet  would  complete
this work, which has now been completed by the  inquiry  into  comprehensive
social security. This is welcome. We are also seeing a  noticeable  increase
in the uptake of welfare grants from R1 million in April 2000 to  over  R1,5
million in April 2002. We have also made progress in that we  have  achieved
what we promised to do in order to expand services to benefit more people.

What is also pleasing is the change in the social welfare system to  a  more
developmental approach. We appreciate the fact that this will include  self-
sustaining  poverty  eradication  projects.  For  example,  in  the  2001-02
financial year the Department of Social Development  allocated  30%  of  its
poverty relief fund to 30 development nodes  identified  in  the  Integrated
Sustainable Rural Development Strategy. This development  focus  will  go  a
long way in decreasing dependency on social grants.

We welcome the extended definition of those vulnerable in  our  society,  as
pronounced by the President last Friday. In addition to the aged, young  and
disabled, we will also target individuals who are unskilled and  those  with
low levels of education in general,  with  the  aim  of  making  them  self-
reliant through empowerment programmes.

In  this  regard,  we  want  to  express  our  appreciation  for  this  bold
intervention by our Government and we are convinced that it  will  have  the
desirable outcome. This will  certainly  increase  the  potential  of  these
citizens to become normal participants in  the  economy,  thereby  enhancing
their self-esteem.

Most importantly, this intervention  constitutes  a  direct  attack  on  the
source of poverty, namely unequal distribution of knowledge and skills.  The
cycle of poverty that characterises  our  dual  economy  is  not  a  natural
phenomenon that will break up naturally. Bold steps are  required,  and  the
bold leadership  provided  by  our  Government  in  this  regard  is  highly
recommended.

We have also made great progress as far as our health system  is  concerned.
In this regard, I wish to point out  that  unlike  in  the  past  when  huge
resources from health were directed to research and metropolitans,  we  have
now reprioritised so that these resources and facilities go to rural  areas.
This will benefit the majority of our people. [Applause.]

I have pointed out that we have made progress in terms of what  we  promised
the people of this country in 1999. Today I can say  quite  openly  that  we
have succeeded in laying a foundation for further  development.  We  have  a
sound social infrastructure. The resources that we have invested to  develop
a sound social infrastructure will go  a  long  way  in  improving  economic
growth.

There is obviously a circular causation between economic growth  and  social
development. While the economy is growing, as the President  pointed  out  -
although not to our satisfaction - we have to increase our social spending.

With regard to the question of fighting poverty, we have put in place short-
term strategies to deal with poverty relief.  But,  most  importantly,  when
our people's health improves and they become educated, we are in a  position
to ensure that in the long  term  we  are  able  to  increase  our  economic
development. Equally important is that this is not a one-way  direction.  As
the economy improves, so we are able to  develop  our  people.  And  as  our
people improve, they will be able to bring in new skills, and we  will  then
be able to attack poverty directly. [Applause.]

Comrade Nqcobo pointed out yesterday that what we need  is  to  have  highly
skilled people. Our strategy and our approach is to fight poverty  directly.
It is not a trickle-down approach, hence we invest enormously in our  social
infrastructure. [Applause.]

I just want to end by saying that some of the most irresponsible  statements
have been made from that side of the House. An attack has been made  on  our
President in that he wastes a lot of  time  on  global  issues  rather  than
domestic issues. This planet has become very small, it is a global  village.
The interdependence that we have today does not allow us to go back  to  the
period of isolation of the apartheid days if we are to develop. [Applause.]

Some of the economic problems that we have, have to  do  with  the  economic
order in the world. We don't want to be passive; to be people who are  acted
upon by other people  who  want  to  be  active  subjects.  We  want  to  be
influenced as much as  we  want  to  influence.  We  cannot  forever  remain
objects that are acted upon. If we are to progress, we have  to  change  the
global order. We have to change and influence the United  Nations.  We  have
to influence other governing structures. We cannot remain  passive.  We  are
active, and that is what we are doing.

Some hon members from that side have been saying that time and again we  use
the words ``integrated'' and ``comprehensive''. You have to understand  that
if we are to deal, in a sustainable way, with the  question  of  growth  and
development, we need to deal with the fundamentals. It  is  also  critically
important that we are able to understand that development requires  that  we
think systematically.

Systems thinking is very, very  important.  You  cannot  talk  about  health
without talking about transport, without talking about  other  things.  That
is what systemic thinking is about. If we are to develop  and  progress,  we
need to think  broadly  because  one  aspect  affects  another  -  there  is
interdependency.

So if we want to address the question of health, social security  and  other
aspects, we need to take a broad picture and understand  that  these  issues
are interdependent. That is what systems thinking is all about.  You  cannot
think of just one small part and tinker with the system without taking  into
account the whole system.

So we are on course and we hope that this  year  we  will  get  a  response.
Thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Business suspended at 12:40 and resumed at 15:01.

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam Speaker, hon members,  guests,  members
of the diplomatic corps, first of all I would like to thank hon members  for
their contributions during this  debate.  We  have  noted  the  constructive
suggestions made by some of the members and will consider them.

For  example,  I  agree  with  the  hon  Wilma  Newhoudt-Druchen  about  the
important matters she raised with regard to the challenges around the  issue
of disability.

We will intensify our focus on this issue throughout this African Decade  of
Disabled People, and beyond. Surely, our Government will have  to  give  the
necessary support to the Deaf Federation of South Africa in its bid to  host
the important Fifteenth World Congress of the World Federation of  the  Deaf
in 2007.

We will also follow up  on  the  suggestions  made  by  the  hon  Nkosinathi
Mthethwa on the matter of youth development. I  would  like  to  assure  him
that within the next four weeks the Government will consider  two  important
documents relating to our youth.

One of these will deal with the long-outstanding policy  framework  for  the
establishment of a national  youth  service.  The  other,  prepared  by  the
National  Youth  Commission  and  the   Umsobomvu   Fund,   will   cover   a
comprehensive programme of action for  youth  development  and  empowerment.
[Applause.]

We have already intervened with the government of Zimbabwe to deal with  the
issue of property owned by South Africans. The matter of the  conclusion  of
a bilateral agreement with Zimbabwe on the protection of investment in  both
countries has been discussed and is under consideration.

The hon  Johnny  de  Lange  also  made  an  important  contribution  to  the
discussion  that  must  take  place  about  the  crucial   matter   of   the
transformation of the judiciary. The Government will carefully consider  the
views he expressed.

The hon Derek Hanekom made the critical point that all of us, both  citizens
and Government, need ``creative thinking'' with regard to the  challenge  of
employment creation and the eradication of poverty. I trust that all  of  us
will respond to this  and  ``think  outside  the  box'',  to  use  a  common
expression.

I would also like to thank the hon Kader Asmal for drawing the attention  of
the House and the country to  the  fact  that  this  month  marks  the  25th
anniversary  of  the  passing  away  of  a  great  African  patriot,  Robert
Mangaliso Sobukwe. I join him in the tribute he made  to  this  son  of  our
people. Hopefully our national Parliament will take time to  salute  him  on
the 25th anniversary of his death, February 27, as we all should.

Clearly we will have to follow up on the important remarks made by  the  hon
members Musa Zondi and Suzanne Vos, which bear on the  important  matter  of
the responsibilities of the citizen.

The hon Nqaba  Ngcobo  will  be  pleased  to  know  that  to  implement  our
biotechnology strategy, only this month  Government  opened  three  regional
biotechnology innovation centres in the Western Cape, Gauteng  and  KwaZulu-
Natal, focusing on such areas as  human  health,  industrial  biotechnology,
food security and agricultural production.

I was pleased that the hon  Baleka  Mbete,  the  Deputy  Speaker,  drew  our
attention to the important matter of Freedom Park.  I  trust  that  the  hon
members will take up her suggestion  to  sensitise  our  people  about  this
important national monument.

Other hon members made equally important  proposals,  which  the  Government
will consider carefully.

Yesterday the hon Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi made an  appeal  for  ``people  of
goodwill and  representatives  of  our  people,  irrespective  of  political
divisions or allegiances'' to come together to address  various  matters  of
concern that he had raised.

Clearly, all reasonable people will agree with this proposal. As this  House
knows, the national  Government  includes  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers
drawn from four political organisations. We  did  this  precisely  to  bring
together the people to whom  Dr  Buthelezi  referred,  to  act  together  on
matters of concern to our people as a whole.

The hon Dr Buthelezi also mentioned the need for us to move  away  from  the
mutual suspicions of the past. I am certain that this outcome  can  only  be
achieved in the practice, in the process of working together in  the  manner
suggested by the hon Dr Buthelezi.
However, we must also recognise the fact that as we sit in  this  House,  we
represent  different  parties  and  different  schools  of  ideological  and
political thought. Out of this come different responses  to  the  challenges
facing our country. It may very well be that, in the main, all of  us  agree
on the identification of many of our national problems.

But as the debate  demonstrated,  we  have  different  solutions  for  these
problems, reflecting our  different  ideological  and  political  positions.
There is nothing either wrong or unacceptable about this.

Our democratic system gives the necessary space for all these  views  to  be
expressed and pursued. It  also  gives  the  possibility  to  all  political
formations to win the support of the people and thus form the government  of
our country.

I must assume from this that, despite the commendable call  of  the  hon  Dr
Buthelezi for us to come together irrespective of political divisions,  none
of the parties  represented  here,  including  the  IFP,  will  relax  their
efforts to win power. [Laughter.]

The hon Tony Leon, the Leader of the Opposition, stated this matter  frankly
when he said that the DP and the IFP,  which  he  described  as  ``the  real
opposition'', had formed a partnership jointly to exercise  power  ``locally
and provincially in KwaZulu-Natal'', as he put it.

He promised the House that this partnership ``must and will build'' on  this
foundation, obviously to capture power both beyond the province of  KwaZulu-
Natal, and at the national level.  This  is  perfectly  natural  and  normal
political behaviour. It has nothing to do with  a  gathering  of  people  of
goodwill, of which the hon Dr Buthelezi spoke. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

I make these comments to say that the consolidation  of  our  democracy  and
the achievement of  the  goal  of  reconstruction  and  development  do  not
require that we should try to force ourselves into a  false  consensus.  The
Government will not be persuaded to adopt policies it  believes  are  wrong,
merely to please some, by creating  the  space  for  the  implementation  of
policies that have failed to win the support of the people. [Applause.]

Some  of  the  hon  members  spoke  eloquently  to  advance   a   particular
ideological approach to our economic development.  Accordingly,  they  urged
privatisation, deregulation, labour market flexibility, tax  reduction,  the
abolition  of  foreign  exchange  control,  and  the  abandonment   of   the
developmental role of  the  state,  giving  it  what  was  described  as  an
``indicative role'', on the basis that ``the state is the problem''.

We do not agree and will not  support  the  proposition  that  informs  this
approach - that we should rely solely  and  exclusively  on  the  market  to
solve the  problems  facing  our  people.  [Applause.]  We  are  not  market
fundamentalists and will obviously not seek to build  a  national  consensus
on the basis of the ideology and practice of market fundamentalism.

Very regularly in our country, we see different interpretations of  what  is
happening in our society, based  on  the  variety  of  our  ideological  and
political positions. Thus every statistic becomes a  matter  of  ideological
and  political  debate,  depending  on  where  we  stand  in  the  political
spectrum. Some of us delight in falsely presenting our country as being  the
worst in the world with regard to the most negative antisocial activities.

During the debate, the assertion was repeated boldly, that ``there  is  much
greater poverty today than there was in 1994'', and that:


  ... life is no better now than it was in 1994. For many people, in  spite
  of political freedom, life is actually worse.

Neither of these statements is true. This  House  would  serve  the  country
well if it allowed those who insist on these conclusions to present  to  the
House and the country such information as  they  may  have  to  substantiate
these claims.

In this regard, all of us will have to pay attention to the remarks made  by
the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, the hon Nkosinathi Nhleko.

During the debate, the view was also  advanced  that  the  policies  we  are
implementing to  build  a  nonracial  South  Africa  are  resulting  in  the
sustenance of what used to be  called  ``white  fears''  and  a  feeling  of
marginalisation, especially among the Afrikaners. In this  regard  reference
was made to such issues as  language,  culture,  affirmative  action,  black
economic empowerment and Zimbabwe.

The Government is aware of its responsibility  to  all  the  people  of  our
country. It works within  the  framework  set  by  our  Constitution,  which
includes correcting the racial imbalances  we  inherited.  In  carrying  out
this work, we strive for the closest  co-operation  possible  with  all  our
people, including their organisations.

We will persist  with  this  work,  remaining  sensitive  to  the  feelings,
aspirations and hopes of all our  people,  and  the  injunction  that  South
Africa belongs to all who live in  it,  black  and  white.  Accordingly,  we
agree fully with the late Prof Piet Cillié, as  quoted  by  the  hon  Renier
Schoeman, when he said, ``true  patriotism  is  love  for  a  country  which
encompasses the dreams of all its citizens''.

We are at all times ready closely to examine and change any  and  all  parts
of the work of the Government that might not encompass, in  a  balanced  and
inclusive way, the dreams of all our citizens. The Government must and  will
keep its doors open to all South Africans who wish to express  concern  that
our policies do not encompass the dreams of all our citizens, in a  balanced
and inclusive manner.

At the same time I would like to make  the  point  that  we  have  a  common
responsibility not to frighten any of our people by presenting them  with  a
false apocalypse. [Applause.] The task to  reassure  all  our  people  about
their future as South Africans, equal to  any  other  South  African,  is  a
common responsibility that belongs to all of us.  Without  saying  that  any
one of us has done this, I would like to urge that  none  of  us  should  go
around scaring people, and then urge the President  to  reassure  those  who
have been frightened. [Applause.]

I am certain that if more of us  spoke  out  as  the  hon  Dirk  Bakker  did
earlier today, we would have fewer people who entertain  fears  about  their
future as South Africans.

Quite incorrectly, some hon members beat loud drums about some matters  they
said were not addressed in the state of the nation  address.  Frankly,  this
was puzzling. In this regard, I would like  to  thank  the  hon  Dr  Stanley
Mogoba for helping to unravel this mystery. [Interjections.]

Hon members will remember his remark that the address was ``above our  heads
and that of the nation''. [Laughter.] He went on to say that  on  his  part,
he understood  it  better  ``when  one  reads  and  re-reads  the  speech''.
[Laughter.] Clearly some among us did not do what he  did,  merely  to  read
the address. There was no attempt whatsoever to speak  above  the  heads  of
the hon members and the nation.

However, we must take the matter to heart that we  should  not  speak  in  a
manner that results in this unintended consequence. [Laughter.] At the  same
time, I assume that it is the responsibility of all hon members to  seek  to
understand the written documents tabled in this House, whoever tables  them,
and thus obviate unnecessary  debate  driven  by  ignorance  and  prejudice.
[Applause.]

I would like to thank various members of the Government,  such  as  the  hon
Ministers Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi,  Kader  Asmal
and Penuell Maduna, who provided details of  the  Government  programmes  we
mentioned, with which the hon members should be familiar,  about  which  the
charge was made that we had not adequately addressed them.

However, as with other matters in the past, I suspect that  the  beating  of
the drums reflected differences with the  policies  and  programmes  of  the
Government rather than an economy of words on our part.

With regard to the matter of Iraq, which hon members Aziz  Pahad  and  Pallo
Jordan have addressed extensively, a most unfortunate  suggestion  has  also
been made that we should determine our  positions  on  the  basis  of  venal
considerations that have nothing to do with principle. It  was  specifically
suggested that with regard to the United States,  our  behaviour  should  be
governed by such economic benefits as derive from AGOA, the  African  Growth
and Opportunity Act.

Our Government maintains very good relations  with  the  government  of  the
United States. At all levels, the US administration has interacted  with  us
in an open, co-operative  and  supportive  manner.  At  all  times,  it  has
respected our right to hold our own  views  on  any  matter.  When  we  have
differed on any issue, there has never been any  suggestion  that  it  would
starve us to force us to submit to its views.

On the matter of Iraq, we are entirely at one with the US and  the  UN  that
Iraq should be  free  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction.  We  welcomed  and
supported the decision of the government of the United States to refer  this
matter to the UN Security Council, to ensure its peaceful  and  multilateral
resolution. We have done and will do  what  we  can  to  contribute  to  the
achievement of  this  outcome.  Last  Saturday  our  people,  together  with
millions across the globe, demonstrated in  our  streets  to  express  their
support for these results.

It is strange that some  among  us  present  all  of  this  as  being  anti-
American. We have neither the desire nor the intention to become enemies  of
the  United  States.  I  think  that  it  is   also   a   most   unfortunate
representation of the United States government that some should  peddle  the
suggestion that this administration is standing by to inflict  harm  on  our
people, if we do not say ``ja baas!'' - allegedly in the national interest!

Some in this House have sought  to  belittle  the  importance  of  the  Iraq
question, falsely claiming that a peaceful, multilateral resolution of  this
issue constitutes ``closing ranks around Saddam Hussein'', and that  in  any
case, Iraq is far from our country. At the same time,  some  of  these  very
same hon members have made bold to say ``we must make it our  responsibility
to promote and, if  necessary,  force  democracy  and  freedom  in  our  own
region''.

I would like to take this opportunity  to  assure  our  neighbours  and  the
peoples of the rest of Africa that the  government  we  lead  has  no  great
power pretensions. We claim no right to impose our will on  any  independent
country. [Applause.]

We will not force anything on anybody but will act  within  the  context  of
our international agreements, approved by this Parliament, which  oblige  us
to respect the obligations that fall on us in the context of  our  bilateral
relations,  SADC,  the  African  Union,  the   Non-Aligned   Movement,   the
Commonwealth and the United Nations. Whatever we  may  think  of  ourselves,
none of these gives us the unilateral right to force anything on  any  other
independent country.

Let me restate some positions that we have presented to the  House  and  the
nation, last week and earlier.

We have the necessary policies and programmes further to deepen the  process
of the reconstruction and development of our country. We have the  resources
to accelerate this process. Improved capacity does exist within  the  Public
Service to achieve this objective. We have the necessary  basic  information
to determine relatively precisely what needs to be done.

Having  carefully  considered  all  these  matters,   the   Government   has
determined  that  our  central  task  is  to  respond  successfully  to  the
challenge of the effective implementation of our policies and programmes.

This constitutes the central focus of the work  of  Government  during  this
final year of the  first  decade  of  liberation.  Nothing  whatsoever  will
divert us from this goal.

With regard to this task and commitment, I would like to draw the  attention
of hon members to one particular issue that we raised in the  state  of  the
nation address. Let me repeat what I said then.


  With regard to the accomplishment of the task of ensuring a  better  life
  for all, we must make the observation that the  Government  is  perfectly
  conscious of the fact that there are many in our society who  are  unable
  to  benefit  directly  from  whatever  our  economy  is  able  to  offer.
  Obviously, this includes those on pension and the very young.


  But it also includes people who are unskilled and those with  low  levels
  of education in general.  This  reflects  the  structural  fault  in  our
  economy and society as a result of which  we  have  a  dual  economy  and
  society. The one is modern and relatively well developed.  The  other  is
  characterised by underdevelopment and an entrenched crisis of poverty.


  We have to respond to the needs of the fellow South Africans  trapped  in
  the latter society, in a focused and dedicated manner, to extricate  them
  from their condition. The expansion in social provision must  reach  this
  sector of our society, to relieve the poverty  and  suffering  afflicting
  these masses of our people.


  As we will indicate later, other Government interventions will also focus
  on  this  sector  in  a  particular  way.  Critically,  some   of   these
  interventions must aim at ensuring that as many as possible of those  who
  fall within this category move out of the  trap  within  which  they  are
  caught.


  Accordingly, the Government must act to ensure that we reduce the  number
  of people dependent on social welfare, increasing the numbers  that  rely
  for their livelihood on normal participation in the economy. This is also
  especially relevant to the accomplishment of the goal  of  enhancing  the
  dignity of every South African.

That was what I said on Friday. Some hon  members  have  commented  on  this
extremely  important  matter  that  relates  to  a  large  section  of   our
population, that was once callously described as the surplus people.

These valued  South  Africans  are  concentrated  in  the  urban  and  rural
development nodes identified in our  urban  renewal  and  rural  development
programmes, and other areas of our country.

There are many negative features  that  characterise  this  section  of  our
population. It suffers from a high level of  unemployment.  Many  among  its
ranks  are  uneducated  and  unskilled.  It  suffers  from  widespread   and
entrenched poverty.

It is therefore victim to the entire spectrum of  diseases  of  poverty  and
underdevelopment, including those associated with immune deficiency.

It is also subject to the social ills  associated  with  poverty  and  human
despair, such as particular crimes, including murder,  the  abuse  of  women
and children, and other crimes against the person, as well  as  alcohol  and
drug abuse.

It is in these areas  that  we  find  the  concentrated  expression  of  the
challenges we face with regard to the most vulnerable in  our  society:  the
children, the youth, women, the elderly and people with disabilities.

In the end, everything we said in the  state  of  the  nation  address,  and
everything that some of the hon  members  stated  during  the  debate  about
pushing back the frontiers of poverty, and  expanding  access  to  a  better
life for all,  and  the  complex  of  social,  economic  and  administrative
initiatives we spoke of, must translate into changing the lives of those  of
our people who were previously described as the surplus people.

The Government is convinced that because of what we  have  achieved  through
focused and painstaking work over the past few years, we are  now  able  and
have the responsibility especially to attend to the very specific  needs  of
those that the old  society  condemned  to  a  hopeless  life  at  the  very
periphery of misery.

As we indicated in the state of the  nation  address,  all  departments  and
spheres of government will co-operate to meet this and other  challenges  on
a multisector and integrated basis.

Once more, the discharge of this historic  national  responsibility  demands
that all our people should  unite  in  action  in  the  spirit  of  Letsema,
Vukuzenzele and the new patriotism to realise what can and must be  achieved
to give hope to those who despair.

Hopefully, the people of goodwill about whom the  hon  Dr  Buthelezi  spoke,
will become part of this army  of  architects,  whose  reward  will  be  the
material and spiritual liberation of the wretched of the earth.

Later this month, the hon Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele will relinquish both  her
parliamentary seat and her place in Government, to take  up  her  duties  at
the ANC headquarters. I would like to take this  opportunity  to  thank  her
most sincerely for  the  outstanding  work  she  has  done  as  Minister  of
Housing. [Applause.] We will miss her  contributions  as  a  member  of  the
Cabinet and wish her success in her new task.

Before this week closes, a  number  of  distinguished  South  Africans  will
travel to Iraq. I thank them most sincerely for agreeing to  undertake  this
journey. Between them they will be able to address all matters  that  relate
to nuclear, chemical and biological weapons  of  mass  destruction,  missile
systems, nonproliferation and disarmament, affecting  all  weapons  of  mass
destruction.

They  have  worked  with  the  UN  Conference   on   Disarmament   and   the
international bodies responsible for the enforcement  of  the  Nuclear  Non-
Proliferation Treaty and the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions.

As they leave our shores, we wish them Godspeed, confident  that  they  will
contribute everything they can to help Iraq fully to respond proactively  to
the obligations imposed by the UN Security Council Resolution 1441.

They will travel to Baghdad as representatives  of  the  prayers  for  world
peace of the peoples of Africa, the Non-Aligned Movement, the  rest  of  the
world, as well as ourselves.

Hopefully, what they will do, by freely sharing their  invaluable  knowledge
and experience, and facilitating the work both of the UN weapons  inspectors
and the government of Iraq, will be to bring us back from the brink of  war,
while helping to  ensure  that  Iraq  is  truly  free  of  weapons  of  mass
destruction.

I am certain that they undertake their journey with  the  very  best  wishes
and support of this House, of  all  South  Africans  of  goodwill,  and  all
representatives of our people, irrespective of our political  divisions  and
allegiances. [Applause.] They are Mr Deon Smit, Col  Ben  Steyn,  Dr  Philip
Coleman, Mr Super Moloi, Mr Daan van Beek,  Mr  Pieter  Goosen  and  Mr  Tom
Makrum. [Applause.]

Once more, I wish our national Parliament success as it commences  its  work
during this important year in the peaceful evolution of our country.

Thank you, Madam Speaker and hon members. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, on our behalf  I  wish  to  thank  the  President.
Thank you, Mr President, for coming here and for this debate.

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 15:32.
