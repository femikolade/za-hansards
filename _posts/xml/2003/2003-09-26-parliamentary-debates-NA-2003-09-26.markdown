                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms C DUDLEY: Thank you. I hereby give notice on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that Dr Derek Prince, a distinguished Bible teacher, author and
       long-time Jerusalem resident, died on Wednesday morning at the age of
       88 after a series of chronic illnesses;


  (2) sends condolences to  Dr  Prince's  friends  and  his  family  of  11
       children and an extended family of over 150 relatives; and


  (3) notes that the  impact  of  Derek  Prince's  life  and  work  on  the
       Christian world has been like that  of  few  others,  and  he  leaves
       behind a rich legacy.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon member, I am not sure that that is  a  notice  of  a
motion you really wish the House to come back and debate. We have  now  said
notices of motion are issues that we really  want  to  place  on  the  Order
Paper for that day, so that they can actually be delved into.

Mr L M GREEN: Deputy Speaker, could we therefore withdraw that and  then  do
it as a motion without notice?  We  have  consulted  with  the  other  Chief
Whips. Thank you.
Mr A J BOTHA: Hon Deputy Speaker, I hereby give notice on behalf of the DA:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the  crisis  in  the  Agricultural  Research  Council  and  the
       Government's inadequate response thereto, namely,


       (a)  the halving of research capacity and expertise;


       (b)  the increasing exposure to animal diseases and crop pests, which
           diminishes food security and threatens trade; and


       (c)  the undermining of scientific support for Nepad.


  (2) resolves to instruct the Government to take all necessary measures to
       restore the capacity needed to maintain food security in South Africa
       and Southern Africa and enable ongoing international  trade  in  food
       and fibre.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The  motion  without  notice  from  the  ACDP  that  has
already been presented will then come under this.  That  will  be  fine  hon
member, you don't need to get up again.

                         PROUDLY SOUTH AFRICAN WEEK

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  21 to 28 September is Proudly South African week; and


       (b)  since the dawn of democracy the South Africa brand has,  locally
           and internationally, both in  terms  of  quality  and  quantity,
           appreciated considerably and that our creative output  of  goods
           and services has, in real terms, improved;


  (2) believes that -


       (a)  South Africans living in the country and abroad should seek  out
           and support local goods and services and that we  all  have  the
           power to make a difference in our local economy and job creation
           by supporting local goods and services; and


       (b)  this week gives South Africans an  opportunity  to  unite  as  a
           nation and celebrate national pride through  supporting  Proudly
           South African; and


  (3) supports Proudly South African.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon members, may I go back to the motion without  notice
from the ACDP. Are there any objections, just for the sake of  formality  to
the ACDP's motion without notice? No objection.

Agreed to.

                        PASSING AWAY OF SIMON MUZENDA

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker, I move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with  profound  sadness,  the  passing  away,  on  Saturday,  20
           September 2003, of Zimbabwean Vice-President Simon Muzenda; and


       (b)  that Vice-President Muzenda made an immense contribution in  the
           struggle for the liberation of Zimbabwe  from  British  colonial
           rule; and


  (2) conveys its heartfelt condolences  to  the  Muzenda  family  and  the
       government and people of Zimbabwe.

Agreed to.

                           PAN AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the Chairperson and  the  other  Commissioners  of  the
       African Union who took office on 16 September 2003;


  (2) welcomes in particular Mrs  Julia  Joiner  as  the  Commissioner  for
       Political Affairs, whose responsibilities  include  the  Pan  African
       Parliament, and her dedicated commitment to its early establishment;


  (3) looks forward to their leadership and constructive working  relations
       in advancing the course of the unity and development of Africa; and


  (4) pledges support for the establishment of the Pan African Parliament.

Agreed to.

                         RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY HOUSE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That, with reference to  the  resolution  adopted  by  the  House  on  18
  September 2003, the Ad Hoc Committee on Public Auditing  Function  is  to
  complete its task by no later than 28 November 2003.

Agreed to.

                          SUSPENSION OF RULE 23(2)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  move  the
draft resolution printed in my name in the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House suspends Rule 23(2) in regard to Tuesday, 21 October 2003,
  and that the hours of sitting on that day shall be as follows:


     10:00, or such later time as the Speaker determines, to adjournment.

Agreed to.

                            DEATH OF ANC STALWART
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr O BAPELA (ANC): Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The  ANC  notes  with  sadness
the death of one of its stalwarts and veteran  of  the  revolution,  Comrade
Dolly Mashigo of Alexandra township.

She died mysteriously and according to police was mauled by a pack of  dogs,
although further investigations are  continuing.  Ma-Onnica  Mashigo  was  a
member of the ANC underground structures and  uMkhonto  weSizwe,  which  she
served with dedication.

She was arrested together with one of the outstanding leaders  of  the  ANC,
Comrade Joe Qhawe, and others such as Naledi Ntsike, Alec Nchabeleng,  Peter
Nchabeleng, Tokyo Sexwale, Martin Ramokgadi, to  mention  a  few,  who  were
later tried in what was known as the Pretoria treason trial in 1977. Due  to
her resilience and  bravery  she  refused  to  succumb  during  the  drastic
torture she was subjected to in detention. That  brutal  torture,  while  in
detention, however, led to her loss of  memory  which  deteriorated  into  a
mental illness. She was subsequently released in 1978.

MaMashigo never recovered from the mental illness she  suffered  from  since
1978. She continued to live in her house in Tenth Avenue, which was  one  of
the bases of the MK and ANC  underground  structures.  Her  disguise  as  an
operative of MK was as cattle herder. Even during her illness she  continued
to look after the cattle and refused to part with them. Due to  her  illness
she lived a lonely and isolated life until recently when she was taken  into
an old-age home at Itlhokomeleng in Alexandra.

She was recently honoured by one of the  branches  in  Alexandra,  which  is
named after  her,  namely,  the  Onnica  Mashigo  ANC  branch  in  ward  81,
Johannesburg. The ANC salutes this brave and unsung heroine  who  sacrificed
much for a nonracial, nonsexist and democratic South Africa.  May  her  soul
rest in peace. I thank you.

                             ZIMBABWE EXCLUSION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W J SEREMANE (DA): Deputy Speaker, recent events in Zimbabwe  have  shown
that getting tough on President Mugabe can achieve positive results.  It  is
clear that  the  international  embarrassment  and  isolation  of  excluding
Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth Conference  has  led  Robert  Mugabe  to  his
latest,  although  very  belated,  attempt  at   reconciliation   with   the
opposition.

This was achieved despite President Mbeki's  desperate  attempt  to  prevent
it. It is both ironic and sad that John Howard's  tough  approach  succeeded
where President Thabo Mbeki's silent diplomacy failed. But now we need  some
more certainty that President Mugabe intends to follow through  on  engaging
with the opposition, and  that  this  will  not  join  the  list  of  broken
promises.

It is time  for  President  Mbeki  to  adopt  a  new  approach  towards  the
Zimbabwean government. His constructive engagement has proved to  be  little
more than a cover for dancing with dictators, and quiet diplomacy  is  quite
an embarrassment. The only other way forward is aggressive  engagement  with
this despot, Robert Mugabe. I thank you.

                                UNEMPLOYMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M M MDLALOSE (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, about  5,3  million  people  or
31,2% of economically active South Africans were  officially  unemployed  in
March 2003, according to the figures released earlier  this  week  by  Stats
SA.

In the expanded definition of unemployment, it  was  42,1%  or  8,4  million
people. The figure for March last year was 29,4%. These  figures  show  just
how dismal the unemployment situation in this  country  is.  It  is  totally
unacceptable that unemployment is so high and  there  are  no  signs  of  it
dropping at any time.

These unemployed, economically active people could be  contributing  to  the
growth  of  the  South  African  economy.  Such  high  unemployment  creates
negativity and makes people lose hope of ever finding a job and causes  them
to resign themselves to a life of unemployment. We cannot let a  culture  of
unemployment  develop  in  South  Africa.  Something  has  to  be  done.  We
therefore urge all the  relevant  stakeholders  to  urgently  find  ways  of
correcting  this  situation  and  to  find  ways  of  creating   employment,
encouraging entrepreneurs and  finally  putting  an  end  to  the  cycle  of
unemployment.

Government and the private sector have  to  work  together  to  better  this
situation as it affects them both and stops the country and the majority  of
the people from prospering economically. Thank you.

                          REBURIAL OF LINDA JABANE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms T R MODISE (ANC): Deputy Speaker, Linda Jabane,  known  as  the  Lion  of
Chiawelo, a combatant of uMkhonto weSizwe,  who  was  killed  in  a  grenade
explosion during a shoot-out with the security forces in Chiawelo  in  1980,
will be reburied this Saturday.

The death of Linda's aunt on 22 September 2003 has conspired to ensure  that
Linda's reburial on Saturday becomes a joint funeral. The  ANC  is  grateful
to our alliance partners and the Jabane family for working together with  us
to ensure that those who paid for freedom  with  their  lives  are  bestowed
with dignity and recognition befitting their heroism.

We share the grief of the Jabane family, even as we celebrate  the  life  of
the hero they gave  to  our  people  and  us.  Tomorrow  Regina  Mundi  will
reverberate with the song of freedom. [Applause.]

                     REPORT OF INQUIRY INTO FARM ATTACKS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M E OLCKERS (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  New  NP  welcomes  the
finding of the independent inquiry into  farm  attacks,  that  98%  of  farm
attacks are not politically or racially motivated.

This report can go a long way to solve the  problem  of  farm  attacks,  but
then its recommendations must be implemented fully. The New NP wants  to  be
part of this process. We have already requested a meeting with the  Minister
of Safety and Security to discuss the implementation thereof.

What is of concern in this report is the finding of the committee that  some
land  reform  organisations  have  openly  declared   their   intention   to
facilitate land invasions and all indications are that these  invasions  are
going to increase with all the attendant consequences.

The committee finds, in this regard, that farmers are not  being  given  the
assistance to which they are constitutionally entitled. The New NP calls  on
the Government to urgently rectify this situation and to implement  existing
laws governing illegal land invasions.

The report also confirms calls by the  New  NP  that  the  process  of  land
restitution  should  be  speeded  up  in  line  with  existing  legislation,
including the identification of land for residential purposes.

Furthermore, the committee agrees with the New NP that the  phasing  out  of
the commando system should be done  in  an  orderly  way  and  not  leave  a
vacuum.

                 SRC ELECTIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr C P MULDER (FF): Madam Deputy Speaker, on Monday this week the FF made  a
member's statement, bringing results of the SRC elections of the  University
of Pretoria to the attention of this House.

The FF won that election for the  seventh  consecutive  year,  the  DA  came
second and the ANC came third.  In  his  response  to  this  statement,  the
Minister of Education, Minister Asmal, said the following:
  You should be ashamed of claiming victory there, because you are  playing
  with fire. You are too long in the tooth now to play with fire  in  South
  Africa by using racism.

The Minister went on to say:


  The elections were run on a racist basis. All parties which participated,
  opposed the elections.

These statements were absolutely untrue. I  then  pointed  this  out,  on  a
point of order, and asked if it  was  in  order  for  the  hon  Minister  to
mislead the House.

What are the facts? Up to 17 parties participated in  these  elections.  All
posters and election materials were approved  by  the  monitoring  committee
under the chairpersonship of the dean of students, Dr  Ezekiel  Moraka.  One
party out of 17, the ASB, used posters  and  slogans  that  were  racist  in
nature. The FF has no connection or involvement with this  organisation.  No
poster or pamphlet used by the FF was racist in any way.

Despite this, the Minister went on with his racial slander  of  the  FF.  Mr
Asmal, I've known you to be an honest person, a  person  with  integrity.  I
now ask you, in this House, to do the correct thing  and  apologise  to  the
FF.

                         THE DEATH OF DR EDWARD SAID

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr Z P JORDAN (ANC): Thank you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  Yesterday,  on  25
September 2003, we received the sad news of the untimely death of Dr  Edward
Said, one of the  best  known  and  internationally  recognised  Palestinian
intellectuals.

Born in Jerusalem 67 years ago, Dr  Said  became  part  of  the  Palestinian
diaspora and used his incisive  intellect  to  advocate  the  cause  of  the
Palestinian  people  internationally.  A  prolific  writer  on   the   arts,
literature and Middle Eastern affairs, Dr Edward  Said's  reasoned  approach
to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has assisted  thousands  throughout  the
world to better appreciate the justice of the Palestinian cause.

The ANC extends its deepest condolences to his family, his friends  and  his
people. The passing away of this world-renowned scholar is doubly tragic  at
a time when his keen mind could have contributed immeasurably to  finding  a
solution to one of the world's most intractable problems.

We join the rest of humanity in mourning the passing of this great  scholar.
[Applause.]

             FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY OF GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I S MFUNDISI (UCDP): Deputy Speaker, there  are  a  number  of  statutory
bodies that resort under  the  Department  of  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology  that  seem  to  pay  no  attention  to  upholding  standards  of
financial accountability. The current annual report of the Africa  Institute
of SA paints a miserable picture. The report has been qualified  on  grounds
such as no  stock  sheets  being  submitted  for  verification,  expenditure
without authorisation  and  failure  to  present  supporting  documents  for
purchases.

In the case of the National Zoological Gardens of SA there is  no  proof  of
an  internal  audit,  and  the  institution  does  not  adhere  to  Treasury
regulations in that risk  assessments  are  not  conducted  regularly.  Such
practice has resulted in the net loss of R2 112 000, after receiving  a  R15
million subsidy from the department which indicates that the institution  is
dependent on the department.

On the other hand, however, the National Arts Council of SA showed  that  it
is possible to meet the said requirements. Over and  above  the  unqualified
auditor's report,  the  council  has  been  nominated  as  one  of  the  top
performers of the public sector by Mpumelelo empowerment companies. We  call
on the accounting officers of the other institutions to  take  a  leaf  from
the book of the National Arts Council of SA. We have  passed  the  stage  of
struggle bookkeeping. We advise that the time has come for adherence to  the
prescripts of the Public Finance Management Act.

Those whose stewardship is found wanting should appear before  the  Standing
Committee on Public Accounts and, if necessary, be forced to pay the  excess
unaccounted for expenditure as laid down in the Act. I thank you.

                            NATIONAL HERITAGE DAY

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M P MENTOR (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, this past Wednesday South  Africa
celebrated its heritage.  On  Wednesday,  as  South  Africans,  we  afforded
ourselves the opportunity to cast our eyes to the mountains and to  set  our
feet on the mountain ranges,  heritage  sites  and  in  the  oceans  of  our
country, all of which are as beautiful, delicate and warm as the people  who
inhabit the land.

This national Heritage Day allowed us to enjoy the varied songs, dances  and
languages that are the common pride of our people. The day gave us a  moment
to assert our right to shape a better tomorrow for ourselves. It gave  us  a
moment to define ourselves, even as we  pursue  the  strategic  prize  of  a
beautiful, peaceful, nonracial, nonsexist people bound together by a  common
patriotism, loyalty and a spirit of humanism.

The beautiful sense arising out of celebrations served  to  remind  us  that
poverty poses a threat to our heritage, hence the need to put  the  shoulder
to the wheel to strengthen the people's contract for a better  tomorrow.  We
thank you. [Applause.]

           REACTION OF SA POLICE SERVICE TO REPORT ON FARM ATTACKS

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv P S SWART (DA): Mevrou  die  Adjunkspeaker,  die  agb  Minister  Nqakula
verwys graag na die SA Polisiediens se grondwetlike plig om toe te  sien  na
die veiligheid en sekuriteit van al ons mense, 'n plig  wat  nie  geabdikeer
of gedelegeer kan word nie - aldus die argument vir die uitfasering van  die
kommando's. Die polisie se reaksie op die  verslag  oor  plaasaanvalle  moet
teen hierdie agtergrond gesien word.

Twee onrusbarende faktore  staan  egter  uit:  die  agb  Minister  het  eers
aangekondig dat die kommando's deur  'n  spesiale  divisie  in  die  polisie
vervang gaan word, in ooreenstemming met die DA se beleidstukke; daarna  het
hy egter gesê dat dit met gewone sektor polisiëring sal wees  -  steeds  die
idee  dat  die  een  of  ander  permanente  struktuur  sal  kom.  Gister  se
verduideliking deur die polisie se senior bestuur  dat  59 000  kommandolede
deur        50 000        area        misdaadbestrydingsreserviste        en
sektorpolisiëringsreserviste vervang gaan word, gooi egter die bal terug  na
die publiek en die vrywilligers.

Hierdie abdikasie van die polisie se grondwetlike plig  stuur  'n  duidelike
boodskap uit aan die mense in ons landelike gebiede. Saam met die  besondere
klem op die aanbevelings dat boere hulle eie  sekuriteit  moet  opskerp,  sê
dit net een ding: solank die huidige Regering aan bewind is, moet  julle  na
julself omsien.

Die DA se boodskap is duidelik: die beste sekuriteit op plase  is  behoorlik
bemande,  toegeruste,  sigbare,  misdaadvoorkomende   polisiëring.   Dankie.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans member’s statement follows.)

[Adv P S SWART (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, hon  Minister  Nqakula  likes  to
refer to the South African Police Service's constitutional  duty  to  ensure
the safety and security of all our people, a duty that cannot  be  abdicated
or delegated - according to the argument for phasing out the commandos.  The
reaction of the police to the report on farm attacks should be seen  against
this background.

However, two disconcerting factors  stand  out:  the  hon  Minister  firstly
announced that the commandos would be replaced by a special division of  the
police, in accordance with the DA's policies; he then,  however,  said  that
it would be with ordinary sector policing - still the idea that one  or  the
other permanent  structure  will  follow.  Yesterday's  explanation  by  the
police's senior management that 59 000 commando members will be replaced  by
50 000 area crime prevention reservists and sector policing reservists  puts
the ball back into the court of the public and volunteers.

This abdication of the police's constitutional duty sends  a  clear  message
to the people in our rural areas. Along with the  particular  focus  on  the
suggestions that farmers should  step  up  their  own  security,  it  simply
states one thing: As long as the present Government is in  power,  you  have
to take care of yourselves.

The DA's message is clear: The best security on farms is adequately  manned,
equipped, visible, crime-preventative policing. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                      COEGA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ZONE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B C NGIBA (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coega  Industrial  Development
Zone near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape is a  vital  component  of  our
country's assimilated industrial growth  and  the  economic  growth  of  the
Eastern Cape province, where unemployment and extreme poverty are the  order
of the day.

The Coega development is highly ambitious and it was  clear  from  the  very
beginning of the project that a major  anchor  tenant  would  be  needed  to
attract other investors and to make the infrastructural  investment  planned
for the area economically feasible. It was,  therefore,  very  welcome  when
the French aluminium manufacturer, Pechiney, indicated that it  would  build
an aluminium smelter at Coega. Yet that commitment seems now  to  have  been
placed in jeopardy with the Canadian Alcan group poised for a hostile  take-
over of Pechiney.

Alcan's executive has already said that they will not be rushed into  taking
a decision on the smelter project,  and  general  uncertainty  seems  to  be
high. What is even more worrying for the future of Coega is the decision  by
a senior government official that  there  was  still  work  to  be  done  by
Government to clarify  for  ourselves  and  for  investors  what  the  value
proposition is in the industrial development zone,  as  quoted  in  Business
Rapport of 23 September 2003.

What this convoluted statement appears to say  is  that  Government  is  not
sure of how much value Coega will be to itself and to  potential  investors.
Surely this is not ... [Time expired.]

                    TELKOM'S HABITAT FOR HUMANITY PROJECT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L M KGWELE (ANC): Deputy Speaker, last week about  289  Telkom  employees
demonstrated their commitment to President Thabo  Mbeki's  Letsema  call  to
lend a helping hand by participating in a corporate building week when  they
joined me and other local volunteers  in  my  constituency  to  build  three
houses in Oukasie near Brits as part of the  company's  annual  contribution
to  the  Habitat  for  Humanity  project.  Leading  by   example,   Telkom's
chairperson, Nomazizi Mtshotshisa, personally participated in  the  building
process on 18 September 2003. On Saturday, 20 September, we were  joined  by
another delegation of Telkom's top  leadership,  including  the  CEO,  Sizwe
Nxasana and  chief  operational  officer,  Sean  McKenzie,  chief  strategic
officer, C T Tan, and Oupa Magashule, group executive: human  resources,  to
name but a few.

This delegation and their employees really braved the soaring heat  and  got
their hands dirty. At the end of the day  everyone  was  gratified  to  have
made a difference in the impoverished Oukasie community - a fitting  tribute
to the  community's  historic  struggle  against  apartheid  discrimination,
deprivation and resistance against forced removal.

The ANC salutes all the volunteers for reconstruction  and  development  who
were involved, and call for other companies to  emulate  Telkom's  patriotic
example. I thank you. [Applause.]

                    SA CHILDREN LIVING IN ABJECT POVERTY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R T RHODA (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the children  of  South  Africa
are the future of our country, and if 60% of South  Africa's  children  live
in abject poverty and hunger, our  future  looks  bleak.  According  to  the
Minister of  Social  Development,  the  worst  affected  provinces  are  the
Eastern Cape, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal where about two thirds  of  children
face severe deprivation and hunger. It is also of concern  that  the  latest
unemployment figures  released  by  Statistics  SA  reveal  that  about  5,3
million people in South Africa are unemployed, and many of these people  are
parents. This means that they cannot provide their children  with  the  most
basic nutritional necessities, and that every day is a battle for survival.

We have to ensure that all communities are aware of the social  grants,  and
know how to apply, so that all children who will qualify for  social  grants
have access to them. Measures must also be taken to root out corruption  and
maladministration that result in millions of  rands  earmarked  for  poverty
alleviation projects not being spent. It is a disgrace  if  available  funds
are not spent.

The New NP urges all government departments involved in poverty  alleviation
to urgently address all the issues that are preventing  poverty  alleviation
from reaching the most vulnerable of our communities. We  cannot  allow  the
continuance of a situation where a single plate of food has become a  luxury
for more than half of South Africa's children. I thank you.

                        ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr R P ZONDO (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, 27  Israeli  pilots  have  sent  a
letter to the  Israeli  airforce,  declaring  their  refusal  to  carry  out
operations in Palestinian territories. The  contentious  decision  taken  by
those pilots should be commended, as  the  missions  they  carry  out  often
result in the death of ordinary Palestinians.

The ANC believes that, in the pursuit of peaceful  coexistence,  parties  in
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict  should  work  for  the  implementation  of
United Nations resolutions. Our own experience taught us  that  no  military
might is capable of destroying a legitimate human  cause.  The  ANC  salutes
the 27 Israeli pilots for taking a stand on the  side  of  peace  and  human
rights. I thank you. [Applause.]

                              LAND REFORM LAWS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon
members, I would like to agree with the member who raised the issue  of  the
report that came out on farm attacks that this is not a political  issue.  I
think, for all of us, it would help that we  will  have  an  opportunity  to
look at this issue of rural safety in its broader sense, and  also  look  at
how we could build a relationship between communities that stay and work  on
farms and the farm owners,  together with communities that are within  their
borders.

I would, therefore, like to thank the Ministry  of  Safe  and  Security  for
their work, and pledge that we will work  together  with  them  in  ensuring
that we can strengthen  this  relationship  so  that  at  no  time  will  we
continue to have such a situation that is  disturbing  in  the  agricultural
industry.

I again agree on the issues of land reform laws that,  indeed,  we  need  to
ensure that they are enforced to protect  the  lives  of  all,  particularly
farmworkers and against land invasion. But  it  is  also  true  that  it  is
necessary that we perhaps need to raise  the  level  of  awareness  so  that
people can take responsibility to ensure that they can  utilise  those  laws
effectively and not leave them as good statutes and only  deal  with  issues
when problems arise.

On the issue of land restitution, I do agree that it is  necessary  that  we
fast-track this. As we speak, to date the commission has  settled  about  40
430 claims. We know it's still a little bit of a long way to go, but  it  is
also necessary for us to look at how much commitment is followed by  actions
because, in most instances, we always hear  everybody  saying  they  support
land reform and restitution, we need to do more, and we need to  fast-track,
but then the delays sometimes are caused  by  the  very  constituencies  who
push us to fast-track.

I think we all have a challenge as MPs to ensure that, in the resolution  of
claims, we also take part in speeding both parties through  the  process  to
ensure that we can reach an amicable  situation  in  the  shortest  possible
time. Also, we  can  ensure  that  we  don't  use  this  process  to  enrich
ourselves beyond our means, because sometimes the prices  that  are  charged
become really unaffordable. I think  it  is  those  issues  which  sometimes
bedevil the process of why the restitution, and the  resolution  of  claims,
might take a little bit longer.

I would also like to say that it is acknowledged that  there  is  a  lot  of
work that we have to do in ensuring that we keep our agricultural  industry,
particularly the research capacity, intact. It is also  necessary  that,  as
members, we are honest and understand the things that we discuss  and  agree
upon, and not come here and make short political  statements  that  actually
don't take us anywhere. Thank you. [Applause.]

                              RURAL SAFETY PLAN

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND  SECURITY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  one  of  the
things that our democracy has been able to do has been to  free  our  people
from fear. We, who understand fully well what we need to do to  ensure  that
we implement all  the  various  elements  that  relate  to  this  democracy,
understand this.

When you track the results of elections from 1994 to date, you will see  how
many people are leaving the laager  of  fear  and  joining  people  who  are
building democracy in this country. That is why we won in Stellenbosch;  why
people from the DA wanted to put the fear of hell in  people  so  that  they
did not vote for us. They voted for us and  we  won  in  Stellenbosch.  They
tried the same thing near Uitenhage, in Despatch, and we won there as well.

What is happening is that, in so far as the commandos are  concerned,  we've
said this over and over again, ... [Interjections] ...  that  we  have  area
combat units in the police that are responsible for  fighting  crime  there.
They are going to be joined by the sector policing units of the SAPS and  we
have said that people who  are  part  of  our  volunteer  system,  including
people who are part and parcel  of  the  present  members  of  the  commando
units, are working on our rural safety plan at the moment.

We have explained this to people who  represent  organised  agriculture  and
they understand that. We have explained this to  many  people  who  want  to
assist so that we succeed in implementing the demands of our democracy.  But
people in the DA will not understand this. They  will  not  understand  that
they are bleeding because people no  longer  fear  this  democracy.  Members
continue to try to use fear as a tool for mobilisation, but it is not  going
to work, as it did not work in Stellenbosch or Despatch. [Applause.]

                            EQUALITY LEGISLATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, and the  hon  Minister  of  Safety
and Security, lest his exuberance gets the better of him.  May  I  say  that
Edward Said was a great educationist and so, I think, we'll  miss  him  very
much, and his remarkable insights into education.

The honourable leader of the FF is an honourable man. I am grateful that  he
gave  me  early  notice  yesterday  that  he  would  be  raising  it  today.
Therefore, I think it's important that we should pay  serious  attention  to
what he has said. The accusation that I've misled the House is possibly  the
most serious accusation  you  can  make  against  a  member  of  Parliament.
Therefore, to accuse also the statement of being untrue is to accuse an  hon
member of speaking lies. That is why, I think, I must treat  this  seriously
and say very categorically  that  the  FF  should  not  feel  they're  in  a
position that they have to apologise or to accept  everything  that  happens
in an institution.

I want to say that the equality legislation now is in  force.  Every  public
official and institution  is  obliged,  under  the  law,  to  vindicate  and
support the equality legislation.  One  of  the  very  important  things  is
because it reflects the  social  mores  of  our  country,  it  reflects  our
opposition to racism.
We can espouse racism in two ways; namely, a direct form of racism  to  say,
for example, the ASB said that ``the struggle our fathers  began  will  rage
on until we die or triumph''. That's a direct statement  to  say,  in  fact,
that the vast majority in this country are wrong. The other way is  indirect
racism; the effect of what you do is to have racist conclusions.

Therefore, I've asked the Vice Chancellor  of  the  Pretoria  University  to
investigate this matter. All I can go by is a Sunday Times story, which  has
photographs  that  say  so,  a  poster  by  an  alliance  of  the  FF,   the
conservative  party,  and  Tuks  Afrikaans  students.  It's   virtually   an
alliance. I can only go by that. If it's wrong, then I'll come back  to  the
FF. Therefore, that is why I say that if your reference is the alliance  and
the picture here of the FF, CP and TAS, your father  -  a  picture  of  Paul
Kruger - wants your vote. That's what I meant  about  there  being  indirect
ways of coming to a conclusion. But if  the  alliance  exists,  the  climate
there drove black students to say they  want  to  graduate  and  leave  this
place; they don't feel comfortable here. That's fairly widespread.

Also, a correction for the hon member: All the posters were  not  passed  by
the authorities. It says here it was by Mr de Wet, an ASB executive  member.
Then all of a sudden he says clearly: ``Some of the posters were not  passed
by Mr Moroka.'' Now I regret to say of the university officials  that  their
colour might be the same as mine, but they make a joke out of this.

I don't think the posters created the right climate at Pretoria  University.
The climate is very important where, in  fact,  large  numbers  of  students
feel besieged, isolated, unwanted and that's the  important  thing.  And  my
job as a Minister who cares about young people is to say that all our  young
people should be comfortable in our institutions. [Time expired.]

                          COEGA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                            (Minister's Response)
The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Speaker, let  me  respond  to  the
hon Ngiba on the issue of Coega. Let me first of all agree with him.  I  was
fortunate enough to go and look at the project  last  weekend,  as  did  our
President, and I think anyone in the Eastern Cape should go and have a  look
at this project. It's now a major construction  project,  the  new  port  is
very exciting. The back of the port area where we are developing the IDZ  is
undoubtedly one of the best industrial locations in the world today.

We would also urge you to look at the induction centre.  We've  developed  a
new methodology with the Coega Development  Corporation  of  establishing  a
database of people who could be employed. We've put in  everyone's  house  a
form saying that if you are interested in employment, give us  the  records.
When I was there people  were  going  through  the  induction  and  training
process. The small business enterprises that are part of  the  project  were
going through recognition of prior learning accreditation. So  it's  a  very
exciting project.

With regard to the Pechiney smelter,  I  would  caution  against  any  undue
excitement about press reports. It's an immensely complex and  big  project.
Should it take place in  South  Africa,  it  would  be  the  largest  single
foreign investment ever in South Africa. So it's  a  complex  and  difficult
project. And, obviously the  Alcan  merger  with  Pechiney,  which  will  be
decided on by the EU on Monday, could have an impact on the timing of  this,
but we remain confident that the project is likely to go ahead.

In any event, the interest now being expressed in  the  Coega  IDZ  is  very
strong indeed. So, I think that the Nelson Mandela Metropole in the  Eastern
Cape as a whole can look forward to some exciting developments in the  Coega
IDZ. [Applause.]

        STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY ON CANCUN MEETING

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon  members,  may
I thank you for this time to address the House  on  a  matter  that  is  and
should be of interest to all South Africans. I will not take you  through  a
blow-by-blow account of the meeting or through the finely  honed  detail  of
the contesting text. I wish to take you through what we  are  fighting  for,
in the hope and belief that all in the House can  empathise  with  the  just
and good cause.

My written statement is probably slightly longer than what I  hope  to  say,
as I hope it will help the lay person  to  better  understand  some  of  the
intricacies of this vast set of agreements that we loosely refer to  as  the
World Trade Organisation. The WTO and Cancun, Mexico, may seem  institutions
and places that are far removed from the ordinary  South  African.  This  is
not the case. From time immemorial South Africa has been a  trading  nation.
This is fundamental to our economy and  indeed,  our  society.  It  emanates
from the wealth of our natural resources  first  mobilised  by  the  trading
empire we now refer to as Mapungubve.

As an economy and as a people we are linked to  trade.  For  us  it  is  not
possible to extricate development  and  trade  from  the  wellbeing  of  our
people. So it must be the case that we  should  all  be  interested  in  the
structure and equity of the world trading system, which in turn has such  an
influence on investment. The agreements that fall  under  the  WTO  are  now
very  extensive  and  may  well  be  the  largest   integrated   system   of
multilateral agreement in human history. Keeping pace is no mean feat.

This observation leads me to the first  matter  I  should  correctly  report
back to this House. It is a matter of pride that I  can  report  that  South
Africa fully participated in the meeting and all aspects of  the  events  in
Cancun. What we did earned respect. What we achieved was the product of  our
own hard work -  the  Government,  parliamentarians,  business,  unions  and
community  representatives.  As  the  Minister  privileged  to   lead   this
delegation, I wish to record my  immense  personal  pride  at  the  ability,
passion and very hard work of our delegation, and I believe  this  pride  is
worthy of this House's endorsement.

There has been much comment on events in Cancun  and  gratuitous  allocation
of blame as to who was responsible for the failure. The  former  is  welcome
as it shows that this is truly a matter of global concern. The latter is  in
my view disingenuous, as it takes  away  from  the  real  issues.  Both  the
process and the substance of events in  Cancun  raise  sharply  what  is  at
stake if we are to truly and effectively address the  fundamental  challenge
of development in the global economy.

As I have  indicated  the  WTO  is  a  complex  system  of  agreements  that
encapsulates an attempt by nation states  to  govern  the  commerce  between
them. This is not a new phenomenon. Students of history  will  know  of  the
centrality of trade to  the  affairs  of  human  governance.  In  truth  the
history of trade relations is largely one of inequality between peoples.  In
our own times, or at least in the times of some of us, this  inequality  was
explained and measured by  many  great  theorists.  Rauol  Prebisch  is  the
person associated with this specific linking of trade  and  development  and
the formation of the United Nations Conference of Trade and  Development  in
the 1960s.
The agreements on trade and related matters were built up  in  a  series  of
rounds of negotiations within the General Agreement on  Tariffs  and  Trade.
It was the Uruguay Round that led to the formation of the WTO in  1994.  The
central logic of this round was that we had  to  systematise  the  rules  of
global trade and make  them  applicable  to  all.  This  needed  a  new  and
somewhat unusual institution that administered rules,  but  where  decisions
had to be made by consensus. If you reflect on this for a  moment  you  will
realise  that  this  is  indeed  an  interesting  institution.  It   is   an
institution  that  is  very  easy  to  demonise,  but  more   difficult   to
understand.

In South Africa, as we approached the new democracy, we chose to  understand
and develop our capacity to engage. We were right to to do  so.  We  entered
the very last stages of the Uruguay Round as  the  National  Economic  Forum
which included the old government, the ANC and Cosatu. However, the  outcome
of the Uruguay Round was structurally imbalanced in  three  main  dimensions
of the relationship between developed and developing. These  were  the  ways
in which agriculture was dealt with,  the  structure  of  industrial  tariff
liberalisation and the nature of the additional trade-related  matters  that
were added to the agreement system of the new  WTO.  The  imbalance  of  the
outcome was not for want of trying  from  those  developing  countries  that
participated more fully than  the  still  to  be  born  democracy  of  South
Africa.

Let me give some brief elaboration on each of these, as it will provide  the
context of what the G22 or G20+ was trying to do in Cancun.  The  industrial
development and the agricultural production  of  the  developed  world  were
heavily subsidised. In the industrial product domain  these  subsidies  came
to be self-defeating as trade grew.  The  Uruguay  Round  established  clear
disciplines for industrial products although the  developed  countries  were
able to exclude subsidies for research and  development,  environmental  and
regional disparities - very convenient if  you  have  the  wealth  for  such
support.

In agriculture the  process  of  disciplining  subsidies  was  only  set  in
motion. This is a complex matter but the  subsidies  were  placed  in  three
categories of box. The amber  box  was  acknowledged  as  being  very  trade
distorting in the  sense  that  it  directly  impacted  on  the  ability  of
producers to trade. The blue box distorted  trade,  but  did  it  indirectly
through supporting the level of production, price or income in  a  way  that
made it easier to export agricultural surpluses, or because it  kept  prices
stable, also enabling agricultural surpluses. The green box  was  some  form
of angel that protected rural areas and the environment. Its angelic  nature
meant that we should not question it. However, the truth  must  be  that  it
impacts on rural income and capacity. So how it comes to be in some kind  of
isolation ward when it comes  to  trade,  requires  a  certain  intellectual
alchemy. Like all alchemy it can hide many sins.

That this was not a satisfactory outcome was evident to all other  than  the
commercially partisan, so it was agreed  that  the  process  of  reform  and
discipline would have to be taken forward and that this should  be  done  by
1999. This is agriculture. Regrettably 1999 has come and  gone  and  so  has
2001,  2002  and  2003.  So  a  fundamental  imbalance  remains  where   the
agricultural potential of the developing world remains  constrained  by  the
massive wealth transfer by the rich into their agricultural sector. If  some
aspirant, wealthy developing country  tried  to  apply  such  mechanisms  to
their growing industrial capacity  they  would  be  violating  the  rules  -
rightly so, because it would be destabilising for everyone. But  agriculture
is sacrosanct only because of the political and economic power  of  the  key
subsidising countries.

However, the imbalance existed in the  arena  of  liberalising  ie  reducing
tariffs in industrial products as well. Here careful  analysis  showed  that
key areas  of  industrial  production  remain  protected  by  the  developed
economies. This was done by complex agreements  in  critical  products  like
clothing and textiles. In effect these agreements try to stem  the  hole  in
the dyke. Their existence served to massively distort  production  in  these
sectors as they were driven by intricate systems of  preference,  quota  and
country-specific arrangements. It  is  interesting  to  note  how  the  free
market and good economic governance are abandoned behind the veil  of  these
agreements.

In truth these were economic and  commercial  interest  groups  calling  the
shots in the world-trade system. More complex means of protection were  also
left within the system. Selective, very high and relatively high tariffs  on
specific items were left in place. These are referred to  as  tariff  peaks.
More subtle is the effective level of protection on a process.  The  tariff,
for example, on raw cocoa is low and that  on  chocolate  much  higher.  The
chocolate producer, therefore, in Europe has  the  advantage  -  in  fact  a
double advantage - since another big ingredient, in the  form  of  milk,  is
also  heavily  subsidised.  This   tariff   escalation   is   prevalent   in
agriprocessing and  metal  processing  in  the  system.  Despite  this,  the
proportion of trade from  the  developing  world  rose  markedly  after  the
Uruguay Round. What would have been the benefits  if  the  restrictions  had
not been there, and what would have been the developmental  effects  if  the
restrictions had not been there? However, the harsh truth of the  matter  is
that the minority of developing countries made this advance -  and  not  the
majority.

The last area had to do with new burdens placed on the weaker  institutional
fabric  of  the  developing  world.  New  agreements  were  added  requiring
relatively  sophisticated  legal  structures.  This  is  costly   and   even
politically difficult when the political systems are grappling with  poverty
and underdevelopment. Even here the choice of new issues  is  a  product  of
commercial interest.  It  is  not  clear  why  the  matter  of  intellectual
property should have been chosen ahead of a much more basic matter  such  as
trade  documentation,  which   is   generically   referred   to   as   trade
facilitation. Since a bulk  of  commercially  traded  intellectual  property
rights vests  in  the  developed  economies,  they  chose  to  protect  this
position rather than to generally  facilitate  trade.  In  fact,  they  even
invented new concepts of rights in the form of geographic indications -  our
old port, sherry and grappa battle.
After the end of the Uruguay Round in 1994 the  developing  countries  tried
to redress this imbalance. They fought hard, but  did  not  make  a  lot  of
progress. In fact, in Singapore in 1996, at a  second  ministerial  meeting,
further ground was lost in the imbalance when four new issues were added  to
the agenda, hence the ``new issues'' or ``Singapore agenda'' in  WTO  slang.
These were to be some form of agreement on  investment,  competition,  trade
facilitation and extension of a partial agreement from the Uruguay Round  on
government procurement rules to all members.

I do not have the time to elaborate on all of these, suffice it to say  they
are very different in nature and complex  in  conceptualisation.  One  needs
sophisticated governance systems to effectively address all the  intricacies
and more so to implement them. In themselves they are not wrong  issues  and
would certainly be addressed as the WTO matures and deals with more  issues.
However, weighed against the structural imbalance of the world trade  system
that I have outlined, they are not a priority for the developmental  agenda.
The hot favourite of trade facilitation is in large measure being  addressed
by the World Customs Organisation, which  is  currently  chaired  by  Pravin
Gordhan, our own Commissioner of the South African Revenue Service.

The story unfolds. In the build  up  to  Seattle  the  developing  countries
tried once again to achieve a redress in the  imbalance.  However,  what  we
were faced with was a phalanx of new propositions. The EU not only  insisted
that the Singapore issue should be seen as a package, but wanted to add  the
environmental and labour standard issues to any new round. The  USA  ensured
- by intent or by disingenuous  conduct  -  that  the  talks  were  held  in
chaotic conditions and added to this an insistence on  the  labour  standard
issue. The result was a fiasco.

In  Africa  we  worked  hard  to  develop  common  positions.  Many  trading
countries in  the  developing  world  spoke  to  each  other  and  the  very
effective Cairns Group on agriculture worked to  align  their  positions  in
the aftermath of Seattle. This  painstaking  work  led  to  the  Fourth  WTO
Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar. The situation was, to say the  least,
unusual, so after the September 11 tragedy these negotiations took place  in
a security fortress in a Gulf state.

Hard hours of  work  led  to  an  agreement  that  did  point  to  the  Doha
Development Agenda. This was based on the agriculture text defining a  clear
process  forward,  with  the  decisions  on  the  Singapore   issues   being
suspended.  The  suspension  was  subtle  as  it  depended  on  the  careful
timetable of other milestones in the process, particularly  the  process  on
agriculture. Regrettably, the timetable of events  did  not  materialise  as
was intended. We were held hostage to the EU  agricultural  reform  process.
The EU negotiators could not move without the internal process of EU  reform
being decided upon.

What this shows quite clearly is that the WTO  negotiations  are  political.
The sad part about it is that the politics of the  developed  world  retains
an increasingly self-defeating privilege,  whilst  that  of  the  developing
world shows increasing frustration. But to try  and  sanctimoniously  define
power as the reality of negotiation, and the bitter impotence  of  injustice
as  political  rhetoric  serves  no  purpose  other   than   to   fuel   the
irrationality of  the  frustration.  Fortunately,  there  has  been  a  more
powerful response to this impasse from the  developing  world  that  I  will
recount shortly. However, to understand it, we need to  revert  to  the  sad
tale of agriculture.

Within the  narrow  perspective  of  EU  politics,  the  agriculture  reform
process announced in the middle of the year may  seem  to  the  protagonists
within its coliseum as an achievement. However, for  the  global  reform  of
agricultural trade  and  the  prospects  of  agriculture's  contribution  to
development, it holds only the prospect of gradual and  incremental  change.
As the burden of the developmental backlog becomes heavier - a decade  is  a
long time - and, for  those  wondering  how  to  sort  out  the  malaise  of
misallocated surpluses, of course, time is of a different weight.

After little progress had been made in the intense  negotiating  environment
in  Geneva,  a  final-gasp  informal  meeting  of  Ministers  from  some  25
countries tried to find a way out in Montreal at the end of  July.  When  we
heard that  the  EU  and  the  USA  had  been  in  detailed  and  protracted
negotiations, the other Ministers, after trying  collectively  to  move  the
process forward, accepted that the two  should  try  and  move  forward.  To
understand why such a process was considered by the  other  trading  nations
needs a short explication of how the agricultural agenda had unfolded.

Wisely,  the  agriculture  issue  had  been  crystallised  into  three  main
matters, and  the  fourth  was  of  great  significance  to  many  developed
countries. These were the questions  of  support  for  domestic  agriculture
that was of a trade-distorting type, amber  and  blue  boxes  in  the  main.
However, export subsidies and credits  were  now  treated  as  specific  and
separate issues after the wording agreed on  in  Doha.  Here  I  simplify  a
little to make matters clearer for the layperson.

The third matter was market access, which relates to the formula used for  a
generalised reduction of agricultural tariffs. The fourth  was  the  concept
of the nontrade considerations. This  was  previously  referred  to  as  the
multifunctionality of the agricultural sector, or in lay terms it  performed
any function within society, the economy or the galaxy  that  the  ingenuity
of political process could devise. This last cannot be dealt  with  in  full
here, but somewhere in the plot  the  dreaded  geographic  indications  come
back onto the scene.

In Montreal the Ministers felt that the details  of  the  first  and  second
issues - domestic support and export support - could  be  effectively  dealt
with by the Geneva process. However, on market access  the  position  looked
bleak in that it seemed as if the formula that the EU and Japan had  managed
to successfully lobby for was looming. Here, I explain in the  written  text
in much greater detail the difference between  the  Swiss  formula  and  the
Uruguay formula. For those who want to understand  this,  I  recommend  that
you read it. It is an important issue.
For reasons peculiar to the internal politics  of  the  USA,  they  were  in
favour of a Swiss formula, which is a more aggressive  formula  in  reducing
tariffs. The EU and many other countries that shared  their  views  or  were
beguiled by the preference system  that  I  will  make  brief  reference  to
shortly, supported the Uruguay formula. Unfortunately,  the  result  of  the
discussions between the EU and US were perplexing and pointed to  some  form
of accommodation between the USA and the EU that was  looking  for  a  quiet
life in agriculture: Let's not rock the boat!

In response to this text, long-standing  informal  contacts  between  China,
India, South Africa, Brazil, Argentina and other developing  countries  with
a real interest in agriculture came together and worked furiously  to  draft
an alternate approach to agriculture. A text was worked on and,  eventually,
22 countries subscribed to that text.

What was the position of the G22? It addressed the four pillars, but  placed
the emphasis on different matters. It did this on the basis of two  critical
building blocks. The first was the basic starting point that the  burden  of
reform  and  adjustment  lay  in  the  wealthy  developed  economies   where
agriculture involved the minority of the population and was  generally  less
competitive yet  absorbed  massive  resources  to  the  detriment  of  their
consumers and overall cost structures. It was not a question of politics  or
histrionics, only facts agreed on  by  all  dispassionate  analysts.  So  we
needed more certain reductions in domestic support - experts knew  that  the
EU offer meant no actual reduction in the payments that  would  be  made  by
them - elimination of export  subsidies  at  some  agreed  point,  and  real
market access through a defined blend of the  so-called  Swiss  and  Uruguay
formulae.

For  the  developing  countries  which  were  in  a  structurally  different
position by virtue  of  larger  rural  populations  and  the  importance  of
agriculture  in  their  GDPs,  and  which  would  remain  facing  subsidised
agriculture for years to come, their process  of  adjustment  needed  to  be
slower with more safeguards. The degree  to  which  they  liberalised  their
agriculture was open to both negotiation and some  possible  differentiation
since clearly a South Africa and  an  India  were  in  different  positions,
although their developmental problems were less dissimilar.

An unusual situation resulted in  the  tripartite  negotiation  between  the
G22, the USA and the EU. However, although we made massive progress  in  the
agricultural negotiations, the Singapore issues came back onto  the  agenda.
I spell out in the written text some of the aspects  of  why  the  developed
world was divided and why preferences and dependence on preferences were  so
important. Africa was in fact chaired  by  Mauritius  -  a  more  preference
dependent economy is hard to find - and the result was rather  chaotic.  The
G22 absorbed so much of their resources in  debating  and  negotiating  with
the US and Europe that we probably didn't have enough time  to  engage  with
the rest of the developing world.

The Singapore issues, despite the last minute change by the  EU  and  Japan,
eventually led to the stalemate in  the  talks.  The  ACP,  Africa  and  LDC
countries indicated that they were not prepared to accept  even  negotiation
on trade facilitation. In my text, I use an Afrikaans  term  which  is  very
appropriate; I think basically they said that, ``We are gatvol''.  This  led
to the end of the process in Cancun.

A new dynamic in the negotiation  did  emerge,  and  that  was  the  immense
capacity  and  expertise  that  resided  in  the  G22.  The  key  developing
countries came of age and will never look back. To now  attack  Brazil,  who
should be congratulated for their  wonderful  capacity,  patience  and  hard
work, as some kind of naive ringleader of dreamers, is merely to be  looking
for the sunset when a new dawn begins to touch the cattle horns.

That we failed is not something  to  celebrate;  it  is  a  setback,  and  a
painful one, since we did make progress. The costs of the setback  are  high
and should not be underestimated. But  the  problem  does  not  lie  in  the
developing world, it resides in  the  political  systems  of  the  developed
world that cannot see the costs of what they are paying for  in  such  large
amounts. In the setback, new forces realised that we have capacity and  need
never ask questions as to the validity of our cause.

In South Africa, we have learnt never to be intoxicated by  the  fervour  of
resistance, but to pursue the cause that is right, and  we  have  learnt  to
know a cul-de-sac when we see it. The G22 is of  the  same  fabric.  Now  we
must work to ensure that the developed world understands that  its  policies
are wrong for all people when it comes to agriculture.

It is a hard time, but we are right. Aluta  continua  is  not  something  we
have to be reticent about in world affairs, no matter what Time Magazine  or
those who know no just cause may say. I thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon Ellis, are you rising on a point of order?

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: We have banned  the
use of party symbols in this House, but it would appear that  the  SACP  are
quite unashamedly walking around  handing  out  their  party  literature.  I
wonder if this is allowed.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: No, hon member.  I  think  that  members  do  distribute
papers of whatever nature.

Mr C M LOWE: Madam Deputy Speaker, having only had sight of  the  Minister's
excellent statement a short while ago, it is difficult to  respond  directly
to the issues he has raised there. But, could I immediately,  on  behalf  of
the DA, congratulate the Minister, his team, the  ambassador  to  the  World
Trade Organisation, the chief negotiator and the entire delegation on  their
leadership and the way they conducted themselves. The DA fully endorses  the
pride that the Minister has expressed this  morning.  You  have  done  South
Africa proud.

Nobody won in Cancun. According to the World Bank, a successful  Doha  Round
could have raised global income by more than $500 billion a  year  by  2015.
More than 60% of that gain would accrue  to  developing  countries,  helping
144 million people out of poverty. While most of the poor  countries'  gains
would come from freer  trade  amongst  themselves,  the  reduction  of  rich
countries' farm subsidies and more open markets  in  the  north  would  also
help. That prize is now lost. Nobody won in Cancun.

Writing in the Financial Times, Martin Wolf says that the  collapse  of  the
ministerial meeting was a triumph for the  ``abominable  no-men''  of  world
trade. Leading the charge were France and India,  the  former  dedicated  to
stopping the European Union offering a decent deal on  agriculture  and  the
latter  as  dedicated  to  creating  a  blocking  coalition  of   developing
countries against serious liberalisation. Wolf  says  their  tacit  alliance
won. But the world lost. Nobody won in Cancun.

But, valuable lessons were learned. For the first time in  20  years  as  we
have heard, poor and developing nations led  by  Brazil,  China  and  India,
including South Africa, formed an alliance, the G21 or 22, and united  as  a
single body. Representing half the world's population and two-thirds of  its
farmers, it  was  well  organised  and  professional.  Representing  diverse
interests, it nevertheless stood together and drove one message  home:  Rich
countries, as the most  profligate  agricultural  subsidisers,  should  make
bigger efforts to cut subsidies and free farm trade.

Rejecting the continued ability of  rich  and  powerful  nations  to  bribe,
bully and blackmail them with divide-and-rule tactics, the G22 ensured  that
the rich countries became victims of their own power. The harsh response  to
the G22 from the United  States  was  perhaps  to  be  expected,  given  the
political realities in a congress where American  negotiators  are  fiercely
defensive of their  outrageous  subsidies.  But  the  G22's  solidarity  was
empowering. At Cancun, the weak  nations  stood  up  to  the  most  powerful
negotiators on earth and were not broken.

The lesson is that if this was possible, then almost anything is.  Suddenly,
the  chance  for  global  justice  that  depends  on  solidarity   for   its
implementation appears on  the  horizon.  While  the  WTO  may  be  mortally
wounded, the G21 may, if they use their power intelligently, find a  way  of
negotiating together.  Perhaps  they  may  even  reinvent  the  WTO  as  the
democratic body that it is supposed to be.

Paradoxically, in fighting so doggedly for  a  worse  world,  the  developed
axis may inadvertently have laid the foundation for the  developing  nations
to engineer a better one. Poor countries' politicians who have welcomed  the
collapse are wrong because the Doha round was specifically  geared  to  help
them. If the momentum in trade negotiations moves away from the WTO, as  now
seems to be the case, everyone will  lose.  But,  once  again,  the  biggest
losers will be the poor countries.

From the start, countries disowned big parts of  the  Doha  agenda.  The  EU
denied that it had ever promised to get rid  of  export  subsidies.  Led  by
India, many developing countries denied that they had  ever  signed  up  for
talks on new rules. Others spent more time  decrying  earlier  trade  rounds
and negotiating new ones.  When  it  came  to  Cancun,  too  many  countries
continued grandstanding in Mexico rather than seeking compromises.

The protection of high-income countries is  obviously  biased  against  poor
countries. But, less well known is that the barriers imposed  by  developing
countries on imports from one another are even  higher.  By  reducing  their
own protection, developing countries should make  big  gains.  That  is  the
great challenge for the G21.

If the EU, Japan and the US resolve to retain their grotesque farm  policies
or if China, Brazil and India refuse to relinquish their  current  barriers,
no negotiation can succeed. That is the core challenge.

Now  is  the  time  for  world  leaders  everywhere  to  step  forward  too,
developing and developed, poor and rich, side-by-side so as  to  ensure,  as
the Minister has said, that all humanity should progress. From  amongst  the
tragedy and the lessons of Cancun, that is the greatest  challenge  of  all.
[Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN:  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  the  IFP  agrees  that  a
valuable opportunity had been lost with the collapse  of  the  negotiations.
But all is not lost. Although the talks fell apart, the countries  did  come
together as the G20-plus. The  IFP  believes  that  for  too  long  has  the
international trade environment been polarised by  the  North-South  divide.
Too often it is the rich countries that set  the  agenda  and  dominate  the
agenda.

Also, the WTO negotiations never take place on a level playing  field.  Most
poor countries lack the intellectual  capital  and  financial  resources  to
participate. I believe that a new solution has to be found. Hon members,  it
is really about people. It is also about the  quality  of  life.  And  South
Africa is not far removed from Cancun, hence the Minister said  that  Cancun
demonstrates a world in contrast.

For example, you have  one  country  in  which  people  are  suffering  from
obesity. In another country people are starving. In one world  people  spend
billions on dietary aids, and in another world one billion  people  live  on
less than a dollar a day. Hon members, agricultural subsidies are  just  one
striking example  of  the  selfish,  narrow  interests  of  rich  countries.
Nowhere  are  the  double  standards  more  painfully   apparent   than   in
agriculture.

Rich countries continue to subsidise their agricultural sectors to the  tune
of R1 billion a day, flooding the world markets with their own  products  at
the expense of poor countries. Perhaps Cancun was a line in  the  sand.  But
what has clearly emerged is that Cancun cannot  be  used  as  a  negotiating
pawn where rulings and agreements always favour the North.  It  also  became
clear that the EU cannot impose  its  own  will  and  hope  that  developing
countries will fall into line.

The world we live in is unequal and the trade rules should  take  that  into
account. The inequality between  two  countries  with  different  levels  of
development is unjust and constitutes the most perverse way of  perpetuating
inequality. The hegemonic race to take hold of markets  at  any  price  must
stop.

Deputy Speaker, what has also emerged is that the multilateral  institutions
such as the IMF and the World Bank also have similar issues. Like  the  WTO,
these institutions lack global credibility and legitimacy.

Once again, we thank the Minister for his participation and we  endorse  the
statement. We thank you for the excellent work you have  done.  The  message
that we must send out in the next round is that  if  we  really  care  about
developing  countries,  the  next  round  needs  to  be  about  development.
Development has to be on the agenda.

You said that  the  global  economy  must  progress  so  that  all  humanity
progresses, and the IFP fully supports this. I thank you. [Applause.]

Dr R T RHODA: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The New NP congratulates  and
commends  our  Minister,   our   Government,   our   parliamentarians,   our
businesspeople, our unions and our community representatives  for  the  very
hard hours of work that are put in. We urge them to continue  with  courage.
Aluta Continua, as they say.

Deputy Speaker, considering the fact that clear disputes  over  agricultural
subsidies would dominate the proceedings, and the fact  that  the  developed
world spends R300 billion a year artificially propping up  its  agricultural
sector, which is more than six times the amount it spends  on  foreign  aid,
the somewhat  disappointing  outcome  at  Cancun  could  perhaps  have  been
anticipated. Along with 20 or so other countries, South  Africa  threw  down
the gauntlet, demanding that the Americans, Europeans and  Japanese  abandon
their farm subsidies that are crippling the ability of the developing  world
to compete.

Whilst we know that the developed world's politicians are unwilling to  risk
their jobs back home, they must remember that in order to create a just  and
better world, sacrifices must be made. We urge leaders  and  communities  of
the developed world to begin viewing this matter in  a  more  serious  light
and urge a fresh, modern and  more  dynamic  approach  in  the  World  Trade
Organisation negotiations that follow, intricate and  complex  as  they  may
be.

The developing world, G20, united and acted in a spirit  of  absolute  unity
to advance its developmental agenda. This was gratifying to see. Then  again
there is also perhaps the responsibility of the poorer  countries  to  lower
their tariffs, according to some economists.  They  will  also  be  able  to
benefit from  this.  So,  it  is  also,  to  some  degree,  a  give-and-take
situation. Quite clearly, sacrifices have to be made on  both  sides  if  we
are to advance the process with greater success.

An ideal situation perhaps, where  both  sides  will  lower  tariffs  whilst
trading with each other. I conclude, as the Minister did, by saying that:


  The problem does not lie with the developing world, it resides  with  the
  political systems of the developed world.

I thank you.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, the ACDP congratulates  the
Minister and the South African delegation on their stand and efforts  during
the WTO ministerial meeting in Cancun. Our goals  are  laudable  and  it  is
good that we are fighting hard  on  this  front  to  achieve  level  playing
fields in the area of world trade.

The difficulty we have though is that this  process  could  take  years  and
even decades to achieve. So what are we  going  to  do  practically  in  the
meantime? To dilute the impact of the existing situation, surely we need  to
seriously look at subsidising ourselves in the  interim  to  actively  level
the playing fields  in  the  meantime.  We  are  not  suggesting  a  shotgun
approach, but specific targeting of industries  which  cannot  survive,  but
which, for the benefit of South Africa, must.
It may also be worthwhile doing  a  study  in  terms  of  exactly  who  will
benefit if we do eventually succeed in  convincing  developed  countries  to
comply with this  global  initiative.  The  thought  here  is  that  Canada,
Argentina and even South Africa, to a certain extent, may  benefit,  but  it
is  unlikely  that  other  African  countries  will  as   the   agricultural
infrastructure is not there.

The question therefore would be: What must we and  other  African  countries
be doing to prepare for such a time? It has been suggested that  the  highly
principled stand of the Africa group was  in  fact  questionable,  and  that
South Africa was right to part company with them and join the  G20  too.  As
most African countries are net importers  of  food  and  other  agricultural
products by large margins, the subsidies which the EU and other farmers  get
help them to reduce the prices of the produce they export to Africa.

This helps African governments to reduce  their  overall  import  bills  and
placate often restless urban populations. The insinuation is that  the  fact
that subsidies kill much of  the  business  of  their  farmers  is  a  minor
consideration to most of these  governments,  where  business  opportunities
for officials take priority over the real welfare of the people.

Developing countries have, however, made their voice heard, and this has  to
be a step in the right direction. Thank you.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, die Nasionale  Aksie  beywer  hom  vir  die
oopstelling  van  wêreldmarkte  en  Suid-Afrika  moet  vrylik  daaraan   kan
deelneem. Wanneer ryk Eerstewêreldlande  met  regeringsubsidies  die  totale
wêreldhandel destabiliseer wat voedsel betref, is daar nie meer  sprake  van
'n  vryemark  nie.  Landbou  in  Suid-Afrika  kan  onmoontlik  meeding   met
regeringsubsidies van die ryk eerstewêreldlande. (Translation  of  Afrikaans
paragraph follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, the National Action is  striving  for  the
opening up of  world  markets  and  South  Africa  should  be  allowed  free
participation in the process. When rich First  World  countries  destabilise
the entire world trade as far as food is concerned, one can no longer  speak
of a free market. Agriculture in South Africa cannot possibly  compete  with
government subsidies of rich First World countries.]

South Africa and Africa may not become the dumping place of US and  European
agricultural products. Therefore the NA  supports  the  Minister's  tireless
efforts in exerting pressure  to  free  these  markets,  and  to  cover  the
farming community in South Africa. Keep up the  good  work,  the  tide  will
turn. Thank you.

Dr R H DAVIES: Madam Deputy Speaker, the outcome of the  Cancun  Ministerial
and the processes in Geneva that preceded it are in my view the  product  of
a very particular balance of forces that exists within the WTO.  This  is  a
balance in which the demands and claims of developing countries for  a  more
equitable trading order can no longer  be  ignored,  even  by  the  powerful
vested interests in developed countries.
This is  so,  in  the  first  instance,  because  issues  like  agricultural
subsidies, which have now created a situation in  which  a  cow  in  the  EU
lives on $2,50 a day, compared to many people in the  developing  world  who
have to subsist on much  less  than  that;  as  well  as  tariff  peaks  and
escalations on products of exports interest  to  developing  countries,  and
skewed rules and procedures within the WTO, are manifestly unjust  and  also
have repeatedly been identified as significant barriers to development.

These issues can also no longer be ignored because developing countries  are
now  much  better  organised,  and  much  more  effective  participants   in
multilateral trade negotiations. However, while the  balance  of  forces  is
such that these claims cannot be ignored, it is not yet such that  there  is
universal acceptance that the priority challenge in the words  of  the  Doha
Declaration is to place ``the needs and interests  of  developing  countries
at the heart of the WTO's work programme''.

In the detailed negotiating processes taking place  in  Geneva  after  Doha,
and ahead of Cancun, negotiators from  developed  countries,  responding  to
the demands of powerful vested interests in their own  countries,  continued
to operate on the basis that they should seek  to  minimise  concessions  to
developing countries, and that for every concession that they  were  finally
forced to make, they should extract a huge pound of flesh in return.

It was this pattern of bargaining that, in my view, led to  the  negotiating
processes  in  Geneva,  ahead  of  the  Cancun  Ministerial,  missing   many
deadlines and failing to produce sufficient momentum towards something  that
could credibly be placed before the Cancun Ministerial as  progress  towards
a development round.

At Cancun itself, negotiators from the rich and powerful  countries  pursued
their now  traditional  negotiating  strategy  of  combining  resistance  to
demands of developing countries, particularly on  agricultural  trade,  with
hardball demands  of  their  own  on  the  Singapore  issues,  and  also  on
nonagricultural market access. As usual, they demonstrated  flexibility  and
showed their bottom line only at the very last moment. This, in the  context
of  what  had  occurred  in  Geneva,  ahead  of  Cancun,   was   a   serious
miscalculation, and the main  reason,  in  my  view,  why  Cancun  adjourned
without reaching substantive agreement.

The outcome of Cancun has clearly created  a  new  reality  and  context  in
global trade negotiations. The fact that Cancun did not adopt a  substantive
agreement does  not  mean  that  the  WTO  process,  mandated  by  the  Doha
Ministerial, has ended. The issues debated at Cancun  will  continue  to  be
grappled with by officials negotiating in Geneva, and the outcome  of  these
processes will eventually have to be presented again, but to Ministers.

The WTO must, therefore, continue to be seen as a focus in the struggle  for
a more equitable and development-focused multilateral trading system. In  my
view progress will depend on finding ways to push forward the case that  we,
along with other  developing  countries,  have  raised,  but  not  yet  won,
namely, that promoting an  equitable  and  development-focused  multilateral
trading system is the absolute priority for world trade at  this  particular
time.

At the same time as we engage in the WTO, however, we need to be aware  that
the outcome of Cancun will fuel the tendency towards selective  bilateralism
on the part of the major trading blocks. The US has already  announced  that
it will be seeking to build a coalition  of  the  willing  in  the  area  of
trade, and that this is not open to those which the US trade  representative
has described as seeking freebies.

It was a great privilege for me to have served as  a  member  of  the  South
African delegation led by Minister Erwin.  As  a  number  of  speakers  have
already indicated, the big new development in Cancun was  the  emergence  of
the group described either as the  G22,  or  sometimes  as  the  G20+.  This
alliance of leading, progressive developing countries emerged at  Cancun  as
a major force, and I do not therefore agree that the outcome was  one  where
nobody won. In fact, I think that this development was a major  victory  for
developing countries.

I want to commend Minster Erwin for the pivotal role  that  he,  along  with
his ministerial colleagues in other countries,  played  in  conceptualising,
working for and consolidating  this  alliance  ahead  of,  and  at,  Cancun.
Progress in my view requires consolidating and building on this process.

The G20+, at present, is an alliance within the WTO on the single  issue  of
agricultural trade, but it has great potential  to  become  much  more  than
that. In fact, it can become an economic alliance, in its own right, of  the
developing world. Such a project,  I  believe,  needs  to  command  priority
attention in the months and years ahead. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        ELECTORAL LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)
The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy Speaker,  we  are  now  earnestly
preparing for the country's third democratic elections to be held  in  2004.
At the moment there are no legal mechanisms governing the electoral  systems
to be used for these elections. You will  recall  that  the  1999  elections
were conducted  in  terms  of  the  transitional  arrangements  set  out  in
schedule 6 to our Constitution. In fact,  section  46  of  the  Constitution
requires Parliament to pass an Act in terms of  which  an  electoral  system
can be determined.

In an attempt  to  find  the  most  appropriate  electoral  system  for  our
country, I appointed the electoral task team under the  chairmanship  of  Dr
Frederick Van Zyl Slabbert in 2002. The electoral task team's brief  was  to
investigate an electoral system best suited to our needs  and  to  formulate
the parameters of new electoral legislation in  order  to  prepare  for  the
scheduled national and provincial elections in 2004 and beyond.

Unfortunately, the approval of this task team was delayed for about  a  year
within the Cabinet process. Once appointed, the task team  proceeded  to  do
its work with  alacrity  and  efficiency.  It  even  held  an  international
conference which gathered a  large  number  of  domestic  and  international
experts  together   with   representatives   of   all   political   parties,
stakeholders and role-players.

The electoral task team reported by means of a report of the majority  which
was, in fact, the report of the electoral task team, as well as  the  report
containing minority views. During its work the electoral task  team  reached
consensus that there  are  four  main  elements  to  be  considered  in  the
formulation of an electoral system relevant to the needs and aspirations  of
South  Africa,  namely,  simplicity,  accountability,   representivity   and
efficiency.

In reviewing the present electoral system the task team concluded  that  the
present  system  meets  the  other   requirements   but   lacks   sufficient
accountability. Therefore, in its majority report the  task  team  suggested
an improvement on the present system which  would  increase  the  number  of
constituencies in order to  provide  for  greater  accountability.  It  also
suggested that the crossing of the floor  should  not  be  allowed.  In  its
minority views the report proposed that the present system  be  kept,  warts
and all.

The task team proceeded from the original terms of reference  which  I  gave
them. I stressed that the electoral law is somehow unusual amongst  all  the
pieces of legislation this Parliament is called  upon  to  adopt  under  the
Constitution. In fact, the electoral  law  determines  the  compact  between
voters and their representatives.

Effectively, it  is  the  employment  contract  between  us  as  members  of
Parliament and our  masters,  the  people  of  South  Africa,  whom  we  are
supposed to serve. As such, it is improper for that contract to  be  written
by the employees and imposed on the employer, which is the people  of  South
Africa.

For this reason, I mandated the electoral task team  to  consider  that  the
Electoral  Law  cannot  belong  to  political  parties  alone,  even  though
political parties were the main key role-players to be  consulted.  However,
the Electoral Law cannot belong only to political parties and  must  reflect
the needs and aspirations of the South African people. This is a  matter  in
which there is  a  peculiar  and  endemic  potential  conflict  between  our
interests as members of Parliament and those of  the  South  African  people
whom we represent. This consideration prompted me to appoint members to  the
task team who are representatives of civil society as well  as  experts  who
are familiar with the needs of our democracy.

I then submitted the report to Cabinet for a decision. Cabinet decided  that
electoral legislation be drafted in line with the  minority  recommendation.
The proposed electoral system for the 2004 elections is incorporated in  the
Electoral Laws Amendment Bill which I now have the  pleasure  and  privilege
of presenting to this House today.

Besides accommodating the electoral system, the Bill  also  seeks  to  amend
certain provisions which have now become obsolete in both the Electoral  Act
of 1998 and the Electoral Commissions Act of  1996.  The  enactment  of  the
Local Government Municipal Electoral Act of 2000 provided for the  electoral
system for municipalities so that the Electoral Act of 1998 now  applies  to
municipal elections only to the extent  that  the  Municipal  Electoral  Act
does not provide.

The Bill also seeks to introduce  a  measure  in  terms  of  which  disabled
voters could be assisted, as well as provisions dealing with  mobile  voting
stations, especially in our rural areas.  Effectively,  in  spite  of  minor
amendments, in the core of its substance this Bill reflects the  legislation
which is presently in force and in terms of which all of  us  were  elected,
except that it registers the possibility of the crossing of the floor  which
was not part of the original mandate in  terms  of  which  all  of  us  were
elected.

Members will remember that during the budget debate I had  committed  myself
to submit to Cabinet provisions in this Bill which  would  allow  our  South
African citizens abroad to vote abroad. As you know, the Bill  provides  for
voting abroad, but only for our officials working in missions, and does  not
allow for our nationals abroad to exercise their franchise abroad.

I did submit to Cabinet the proposal  of  allowing  our  nationals  to  vote
abroad, but Cabinet decided that the matter should be left  as  set  out  in
the  Bill.  However,  Cabinet  decided  that   all   prisoners   should   be
disenfranchised, except those awaiting trial. The  portfolio  committee  has
maintained a Bill in adherence with  these  features  which  emerged  during
Cabinet deliberations.

The schedule containing the  proposed  electoral  system  for  the  National
Assembly and provincial legislatures seeks to retain the  current  electoral
system. The system provides for 400 seats in the  National  Assembly  to  be
filled in an election where voters vote for a party. The party is  allocated
a number of seats proportional to the percentage  of  the  total  number  of
votes attracted by the party and the seats are  filled  from  nine  regional
lists of candidates, topped up, if necessary,  from  the  national  list  of
candidates.

The proposed  amendment  Bill  also  retains  the  current  system  for  the
provincial legislatures and further regulates the modalities  of  conducting
elections  and  the  allocation  of  seats  in  the  National  Assembly  and
provincial legislatures. It must be considered that the electoral system  of
a province may be changed, in  the  case  that  it  adopts  by  means  of  a
provincial constitution, legislative procedures  and  structures  which  are
different from those which are set out in  our  national  Constitution,  for
instance, a bicameral system.

In adopting a minority report of the electoral task team,  Cabinet  released
a statement in which it suggested that the report of  the  majority  of  the
electoral task team and its attached Bill, which  aimed  at  increasing  the
overall accountability of the electoral system, could be considered  by  the
Parliament which will be elected at the next general elections next year.

Obviously, part of the recommendation of the  task  team  has  somehow  been
precluded now because of the amendment to our Constitution which allows  for
the crossing of  the  floor.  However,  these  are  issues  which  the  next
Parliament will need to consider if the  statement  that  Cabinet  made  is,
indeed, going to be implemented after the elections next year.

I wish to thank the portfolio committee for  the  alacrity  and  speed  with
which it processed this Bill. Certain members  of  this  House  saw  fit  to
criticise  me  for  the  timeframe  within  which  this  Bill  was  formally
introduced in Parliament. However, for the record, such criticisms  are  not
deserved. Setting aside that the analysis of the decision of the  task  team
was delayed for about a year, I brought the matter to Cabinet  on  time  for
more extensive debate and deliberations to take place in this Parliament.

However, it was decided that the minority report of the task team had to  be
implemented by means of a constitutional amendment, while  I  felt  that  an
ordinary law would have sufficed. Therefore, the entire matter was moved  to
the Department of Justice which  was  re-engaged  in  the  drafting  of  the
relevant legislation. During such exercise it was decided  that  the  matter
could be handled by  means  of  ordinary  legislation  and,  therefore,  was
brought back to my department where it  was  finalised  in  due  course  and
within good time.

However, it was delayed in Cabinet  because  of  discussions  on  prisoners'
voting rights, voting abroad, mobile units and other issues. I  regret  that
members of the portfolio committee did not have enough time to work on  this
Bill as they would have liked. I do not feel that I should  bear  the  brunt
of their annoyance because I am not responsible for the delays  or,  as  you
can see, the only conclusion that can be drawn is  that  those  who  try  to
apportion blame to me for the delay were playing cheap, party politics.

I must also stress that the report of the task team has been  available  now
since the beginning of the year and that the present Bill reflects  laws  in
terms of which we have all been elected and with which we are obviously  all
very conversant. I also wish to thank Dr Van Zyl Slabbert  and  the  members
of the electoral task team for the excellent job they performed.

They have  collected  a  wealth  of  material  and  information  during  the
international conference they organised. Because of  the  Cabinet  decisions
to which I referred  earlier,  the  debate  on  the  electoral  system  must
continue so as to ensure that the South African people may  enjoy  an  ever-
more perfect, more efficient and accountable democracy.

We must remember that the battle for democracy is  never  won  and  we  must
make a  special  effort  to  continue  to  push  forward  the  frontiers  of
democracy  so  as  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  our  institutions   of
Government.

Accountability is the key cornerstone to the functioning of democracy and  I
trust that this debate may be the beginning of  a  long  process  which  may
lead to greater democracy in our country and to ways and means in which  the
needs and aspirations of our people can be better fulfilled.  We  must  rely
on the power of the South African  people  to  directly  contribute  to  the
governance of the country, for instance, by means of referanda.

As we continue this debate we must strengthen ways and means to  enable  the
South African people to exercise an ever greater role in the functioning  of
our democracy, to an electoral system which serves that  purpose  and  holds
its representatives accountable.  We  must  ensure  that  by  means  of  our
actions our democracy is not short-changed. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr H P CHAUKE: Chairperson, I want to dedicate the ANC debate in  particular
to Ma Mwandi who is in the gallery up there.  She  comes  from  the  Eastern
Cape and is a pensioner. For the past 10 years she has been trying to  apply
for an ID book. She decided to move to Cape  Town,  and  thought  that  only
then would she be assisted to do so. Her story was covered in  a  number  of
newspapers. That is how we managed to pick it  up  and  made  the  necessary
arrangements.  This  morning  she  has  received  her  barcoded   ID   book.
[Applause.]

It will be for the first time that she  exercises  her  right  to  vote  and
there are thousands of Ma Mwandis in the rural areas  who  do  not  have  ID
books. More than 300 000 ID books are still lying at Home  Affairs  offices.
Voter registration will be starting in the  next  six  weeks.  Those  people
will not have the opportunity to register and to vote.  That  is  our  first
concern.

Today we are meeting in  this  august  House  on  the  eve  of  the  general
elections and on the occasion to debate the Electoral Amendment  Bill.  Once
this Bill becomes law it  will  set  the  rules  on  how  the  next  general
elections will be conducted.

However, it is important to give a brief, historical background  as  to  how
this Bill came about. Hon members, our country is still  in  transition.  We
are still trying to  undo  the  damage  done  by  more  than  300  years  of
apartheid and colonialism, and it will not be an easy task.

Therefore we need the wisdom of all South Africans. Because of  this  damage
our democracy must be inclusive of all South Africans  and,  at  all  times,
encourage reconciliation, nation-building and make sure that  it  encourages
peace amongst our people.

[The Cabinet took a decision on 20 March  to  look  at  the  possibility  of
changing the Electoral Act. A  task  team  that  the  Minister  referred  to
earlier was established in that regard. This task team was headed by Dr  Van
Zyl Slabbert. The mandate of this  committee  was  to  conduct  research  on
whether it was appropriate for the Electoral Act to be amended. Hon  members
know that if there is a need to amend an Act we will amend it.

In the nine years of our democracy it was found that it  was  not  necessary
to amend the Electoral Act. The Minister also stated  that  Slabbert's  task
team consulted all political parties  in  Parliament,  and  each  party  was
represented in the task team.

Most of the political parties were of the opinion  that  the  Electoral  Act
should not be amended. Therefore, the Electoral Act  that  we  have  at  the
moment will be used to conduct upcoming elections next year. I also want  to
take this opportunity to thank the task team which  arranged  meetings  with
members of the public, and discussions around the electoral law were held.]

Some of the terms of reference developed for the task team were  to  develop
specific proposals identifying a preferred electoral system to be  canvassed
with  the  offset  role-players  and  stakeholders,  identify  and   control
constitutional parameters, identify the list  of  options  available  within
the concrete circumstances of our country, canvass preferences and views  of
relevant role-players and stakeholders, with specific  regard  to  political
parties in respect of the list of identified options.

many people as possible.]

[Now, what I would like to explain even more elaborately is  that  the  work
that was done by this committee was very neat, because the  conclusion  made
by Cabinet when it gave this report, and I have  explained  that  they  made
this conclusion on the 20th, was that most of  the  parties  indicated  that
they did not agree with the idea that electoral laws should be changed.

There are some parties which decided that the laws should  be  changed,  and
that a law  that  allows  members  to  be  elected  by  their  districts  or
constituencies should be put in place. Parties like  the  DA  are  the  ones
which agreed with the proposal of changing this law. However,  most  parties
agreed that this law should not be changed. So,  one  thing  that  makes  us
happy, and yet also makes us sad, is that these elections  will  take  place
and they will be free and fair.

However, the problem is that  most  of  our  people  will  not  be  able  to
register for these elections. That is the problem that we  are  faced  with.
What should we, as Parliament, do in this case? I would like  to  take  this
opportunity to ask what we, as Parliament, should do to  reach  the  numbers
of our people, in the rural areas as well as in the urban  areas,  who  will
not be able to go and register for these elections.

These opposition parties,  especially  the  DA,  are  now  making  a  noise,
calling people from abroad and saying that South Africans who  live  out  of
the country should also be given the opportunity to come and vote.]

There was a court ruling when the New NP took the IEC and the Government  to
court. I am not going to waste my time on that. Members can look  into  that
court case. I can only give  you  the  case  number,  which  is  1012/99.  I
thought they were supposed to have learnt  a  lesson  from  that  particular
case. They lost the case, and I  want  to  mention  the  campaign  that  the
opposition is running, in particular the hon Leader of the Opposition,  Tony
Leon. He went to London to mobilise South Africans that they must fight  and
defend their rights against this Government who denied  them  the  right  to
vote. [Interjections.]

For your information only one person responded during the  public  hearings.
One e-mail came from London after  a  huge  meeting  was  organised  by  the
Leader of the  Opposition.  That  one  person  is  somewhere  in  London.  I
communicated with the person and  informed  him  correctly  as  to  what  is
happening. He then said to me it was fine and  he  understood.  But  at  the
same time we will make sure that we defend our country and protect  it  very
well. They understand  the  challenge  that  this  country  is  facing.  The
challenge that this country  is  facing  is  people  such  as  I  have  just
mentioned who do not have ID books.

The department has tried its best. We have called on  stakeholders  to  help
because there is a crisis. There is definitely a  problem.  [Interjections.]
The opposition does not have one, because they do not go to villages in  the
Transkei, Limpopo and Giyani. You do not know those areas. Your  only  worry
is a group of people who, if they really understood  that  they  were  South
Africans, would have wanted to help. [Applause.]

The problem with the DA  is  that  they  are  not  in  touch  with  what  is
happening in the country. They should understand that  even  the  commission
has confirmed that. The commission has confirmed that  special  arrangements
were made in the last elections. Only 3 000 South Africans  voted  overseas.
Millions of rands were spent on that  particular  arrangement.  Only  3  000
people voted. [Interjections.]

You should ask yourself, hon Mulder, if your interests are in this  country,
why are you going to mobilise the FF Youth League in London, because  we  do
not have a district in London. All the voters in this country will  register
in the district where they come from. The FF Youth League in  London  raised
their concern that they wanted to vote, and  they  did  not  understand  why
they were not allowed to vote. If not, they were going to take us  to  court
and all that. Hon Mulder represented them.

The same applies to the ACDP. The committee was flooded  with  e-mails  from
the church. Everybody who wrote said he or she was a member of the ACDP.  We
received thousands and thousands of e-mails and hence they  are  represented
in the committee. They are all here in South Africa.

The question is: How do we make it better to allow for poor people  who  for
10 years struggled to get an ID book and who were not  allowed  to  vote  in
the last two elections? How do we do that? How do we help  those  people?  I
think it is a challenge that the ANC is going to take head-on.  We  are  not
going to even ask anybody to help us. We are going to go to those  villages.
We are going to get those individuals and make sure that at the end  of  the
day these people will be able to defend the democracy that people died  for.
[Applause.]

They will be able at the end of the day to defend their gains. The  delivery
we are making as the ANC, the better life we  are  talking  about,  that  is
what Ma Mwandi is all about today. We are making a difference and we  wanted
to work together with the DA, but it is obvious that their interest  is  not
here. [Interjections.] Hon Ellis, your interest is  not  here.  You  do  not
know where Ndabankulu and Tsolo are. You  move  from  here  to  Johannesburg
airport  and  you  come  back.  You  cannot  argue  with   us.   [Laughter.]
[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Now, I want to use this opportunity to thank the IEC and the department,  in
particular Advocate Malatji and Advocate Kelner and those  who  have  helped
us to deal with this Bill in a very short time. We  were  given  only  seven
days to deal with it. We did it and did it well.

I know that you have now put your motions. The Bill  was  referred  back  to
the committee where we did not agree, in particular,  with  section  33.  We
deliberated on it. We still think you had this belief that the 3 000  voters
that you want so much will bring you 20 seats in this  Parliament.  I  think
you are wrong.

We have these motions that you have placed today, hon Mulder.  We  explained
our position as the ANC, why we cannot go this route. The  lost  court  case
of the New NP confirms the position of the ANC, so I think that some  people
need help. The opposition and their leader  really  need  help,  because  he
went overseas in order to try and mobilise people.

They really need help because this country is moving in the right  direction
and the ANC is giving the lead. All members of the ANC, as we go  back  from
here, let us go and mobilise our people. Let us go back and make  sure  that
each and every voter has an ID book and that  they  also  register  for  the
elections. [Applause.]

Mnr I J PRETORIUS: Agb Voorsitter, ek sal  'n  bietjie  later  met  die  agb
voorsitter, mnr Chauke, afreken.  Ek  wil  net  graag  sê  dat  as  die  ANC
Regering meer geld vir Binnelandse Sake gee dan kan hulle hul  administrasie
in die Oos-Kaap ook opknap. [Tussenwerpsels.] Daar  is  veral  een  klousule
wat ek graag vandag wil bespreek en dit is klousule  nege.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Hon Chairperson, I will deal with  the  hon  chairperson,
Mr Chauke, a little later. I  would  just  like  to  say  that  if  the  ANC
Government gives Home  Affairs  more  money  they  can  also  improve  their
administration in the Eastern Cape. [Interjections.] There is one clause  in
particular that I would like to discuss today, and that is clause 9.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Order, hon Pretorius.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: On a point of order: I can  hardly  hear,  not
because I'm older than most of you, but because the noise is a disgrace.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  members,  can  we  afford  the
Minister the opportunity to listen to the debate. He has to respond  at  the
end.

Mnr I J  PRETORIUS:  Klousule  9  is  die  mees  omstrede  maatreël  in  die
wetsontwerp en dit gryp op die oomblik die verbeelding  van  baie  mense  in
die land aan omdat dit die stemreg van Suid-Afrikaners wat  tydelik  in  die
buiteland werk of studeer, gaan wegneem. Indien ek genoeg tyd  het,  sal  ek
ook verwys na klousules 7, 25 en 31, maar ek dink die agb Minister  het  die
saak  redelik  duidelik  gestel  waarom  daar  onder   andere   al   hierdie
amendemente aangebring is aan die Kieswet.

As die ANC ernstig is dat jongmense na die land moet terugkeer, gee dan  aan
diesulkes die reg om in die buiteland te mag stem.  Dan  kry  julle  in  die
proses ook dalk 'n paar stemme, wie weet.

Ek wil eerder vir u sê ... (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr I J PRETORIUS: Clause 9 is the most contentious measure in the Bill  and
it is currently gripping the imagination  of  many  people  in  the  country
because it will  remove  the  right  to  vote  of  South  Africans  who  are
temporarily working or studying abroad. If I have enough time, I  will  also
refer to clauses 7, 25 and 31, but I think the hon Minister stated the  case
fairly clearly as to why, inter alia, all these amendments were made to  the
Electoral Act.

If the ANC is serious about young people returning  to  this  country,  give
them the right to be able to vote abroad. Who  knows,  in  the  process  you
might also get a few votes. I would rather like to say to you ...]

I think the ANC in Cancun is the snakepit in this  matter.  [Interjections.]
The Electoral Act is the rules drafted  by  Parliament  and  which  must  be
applied by the IEC to ensure a free and fair election.

In section 19 of the Constitution of our country the  fundamental  principle
of participation in an election is set out: ``To vote in elections  for  any
legislative body established in terms of the Constitution ... ``.

Section 36(1) of our Constitution affirms that a  constitutional  right  can
only be limited if it is reasonable and justifiable to do  so.  Consequently
there is no doubt about this matter.

Now I would like to give  you  some  history,  sir.  At  a  meeting  of  the
Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs last week, the IEC made a submission  on
special votes for persons abroad. Their proposal reads as follows:


  Temporary absence from the Republic, where he or she ordinarily  resides,
  for one of the following purposes, but in this case, only in an  election
  for the National Assembly:


  (i) Study at a tertiary educational institution;
  (ii)     to perform activities flowing from his or her employment in  the
         Republic;


  (iii)    to pursue business activities.

It was in fact the last purpose, ``to  pursue  business  activities'',  that
eventually became the major issue and a bone of contention.

Tydens 'n bespreking op Dinsdag, 16 September  2003,  het  ek  dit  duidelik
gestel dat die DA ten gunste daarvan is dat Suid-Afrikaners wat  tydelik  in
die buiteland werk of studeer, geregtig moet wees  om  te  stem.  [During  a
discussion on Tuesday, 16 September 2003, I stated clearly that  the  DA  is
in favour of South Africans who are temporarily working or  studying  abroad
being entitled to vote.]

On the next day the discussion was continued and I  proposed  on  behalf  of
the DA that the interpretation of subclause  (iii)  be  widened  to  provide
that South African citizens who are temporarily  working  abroad  should  be
entitled to vote.
Na 'n lang bespreking is 'n wydlopende interpretasie van  subklousule  (iii)
eenparig deur die komitee aanvaar, en het vrede geheers. Die  VF  het  selfs
sy voorstel oor spesiale stemme teruggetrek  nadat  die  nuwe  interpretasie
van subklousule (iii) aanvaar is. Daar sit die agb lid dr Mulder,  vra  hom.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[After a long discussion  a  wide  interpretation  of  subclause  (iii)  was
unanimously accepted by the committee, and there  was  peace.  The  FF  even
withdrew its proposal on special  votes  after  the  new  interpretation  of
subclause (iii) was accepted. The hon member  Mr  Mulder  is  sitting  overk
there, ask him.]

The New NP's member in the committee did not offer any assistance. In  fact,
he wanted the entire  subclause  to  be  deleted.  [Interjections.]  At  the
portfolio committee meeting on Friday, 19 September 2003, the matter took  a
new turn when the Bill had to be voted upon.

The IEC and the  state  law  adviser  suggested  at  the  meeting  that  the
previous interpretation attached to subclause (iii) was too  wide.  The  ANC
majority in the committee then steamrollered the  new  measure  through  the
committee. I want to remind the ANC of what Shakespeare once said:


  Oh! It is excellent
  To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous
  To use it like a giant.

[Applause.]  This  is  the  arrogant  way  in  which  the  ANC  treats   the
constitutional rights of South Africans. But this was still not the  end  of
the matter.

The portfolio committee met again on Tuesday,  23  September  2003,  and  at
this meeting matters took a new turn. The ANC declared that they  wanted  to
give further consideration to the question of foreign  votes  and  suggested
that the other parties could also move amendments if they wanted to. The  DA
accordingly submitted an amendment to the Secretary of  Parliament,  and  it
appears on the Order Paper today.

Everybody was highly surprised when  it  transpired  that  the  proposal  on
special votes, as put forward by the IEC and agreed  to  by  the  committee,
was literally and figuratively thrown out of the window in favour of  a  new
amendment proposed by the ANC. [Interjections.] This  action  taken  by  the
ANC is highly objectionable, to say the least. If this is the way  that  the
ANC wants to manage the parliamentary process, then we  are  heading  for  a
very chaotic state of affairs. [Interjections.]

There is no logical reason. I want to  emphasize  that  there's  no  logical
reason why the ANC and the Government should in any way limit a  person  who
is abroad temporarily with regard to his or her  right  to  vote.  The  only
persons who should not have the right to vote are South  Africans  who  have
emigrated or have taken up permanent residence abroad.

Met die aanvaarding van die wysiging van die ANC sal die grootste  gros  van
Suid-Afrikaners wat volgende jaar tydens die  verkiesing  in  die  buiteland
sal wees nie hul stem kan uitbring nie. [With  the  adoption  of  the  ANC's
amendment most of the  South  Africans  who  will  be  overseas  during  the
election will not be able to vote.]

Thousands of South Africans  living  abroad  are  temporarily  practising  a
variety  of  professions  such  as  medical   doctors,   teachers,   nurses,
engineers, etc.

En daar  is  goeie  redes  daarvoor.  Werkloosheid  is  een  van  die  groot
probleme. [And there are good reasons for that. Unemployment is one  of  the
big problems.]

Efforts are being made by Government circles to draw South Africans back  to
this country and by so doing to put a stop to the so-called brain drain.  In
my opinion, the Government should rather act  proactively.  Give  the  young
people their right to vote, and this will encourage them to return to  their
fatherland and to participate in building up the economy of our country.
Dit is jammer dat die ANC vandag hierdie  bekrompe  benadering  het  en  ons
beeld van die land afbreek. [It is a  pity  that  today  the  ANC  has  this
narrow-minded approach and is damaging our image of the country.]

The arrangement that a voter in a foreign country may cast his or  her  vote
in particular circumstances is a principle that is universally accepted.

Waarom die ANC vandag so verkramp is, gaan my verstand  te  bowe.  [Why  the
ANC is so narrow-minded today is beyond me.]

The DA will definitely oppose the Bill.

Kom ons kyk 'n bietjie na van die punte van kritiek. Dit sal baie  kos.  Die
begroting van Binnelandse Sake vir die geld wat vir die OVK  bestem  is,  is
R640 miljoen. Die OVK het op 'n stadium gesê dit mag R3 miljoen  kos  -  dit
beteken 0,47% van die begroting.  Dan  word  daar  gesê:  ``There  are  many
uncollected ID books.'' (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[Let us look at the points of criticism. It will be  expensive.  The  budget
of Home Affairs regarding the money set aside for the IEC is  R640  million.
At one stage the IEC said that it could cost R3 million - that  means  0,47%
of the budget. Then it is said that: ``There are  too  many  uncollected  ID
books''.]

I made a  plea  last  week  that  the  Government  should  make  more  money
available so that we can assist those people to get their ID  books.  And  I
must say that I know the Eastern Cape; I was born there.  I  know  Tsolo,  I
know Tsomo  and  Cofimvaba;  all  those  places.  [Laughter.]  But  we  also
requested the Department of Home Affairs on the uncollected ID books.  There
may be duplications. There may be people who have already died. Please  sort
that out.  But  that  doesn't  mean  we  are  against  the  distribution  of
uncollected ID books.

Furthermore, the embassies in overseas  countries  will  become  the  voting
stations. Ballot papers were already sent there. Why  will  that  create  so
much cost to send additional ballots to the embassies abroad?

I would like to thank the chairperson. During the committee meeting  we  had
many discussions and I must be fair to him. On many  occasions  he  gave  us
ample time to discuss the matter,  and  I  thank  him  for  his  leadership.
[Applause.]

Prince N E  ZULU:  Hon  Minister,  Ndabezitha!  [Royal  salute.]  Siyabonga.
[Thank you]. We are happy to see  you  have  returned  home  from  a  recent
mission abroad. Home sweet home. Although the  Department  of  Home  Affairs
has difficulty in accessing sufficient funds  for  its  programmes,  I  feel
that I must commend the Government of  the  Republic  in  general,  and  the
Department of  ``Binnelandse  Sake'',  [Home  Affairs]  in  particular,  for
ensuring that every election in the country is  preceded  by  a  process  of
cleaning up legislation that ushers in that particular election.

This process started way back with the Electoral Act of  1993,  followed  by
the Electoral Act of 1998, and up to this day  where  we  are  debating  the
cleaning up of the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill, 2003.

However, the IFP suffered political  hypertension  yesterday  when  the  ANC
reverted to the original version of clause 9 of the Bill.  This  clause  had
been  improved  by  the  portfolio  committee  by  the  addition  of   other
categories of persons that would allow more citizens outside the country  to
vote.

The right to vote is guaranteed in the Constitution, but limitations can  be
effected where  necessary.  The  portfolio  committee  amended  and  parties
supported that amendment providing for an  increase  in  the  categories  of
people allowed to vote.  Such  increased  categories  included  students  at
tertiary institutions, citizens performing  activities  flowing  from  their
employment in the Republic and others pursuing business activities abroad.

The addition  of  these  categories  was  a  way  towards  a  constitutional
obligation that all citizens have a right to vote. The IFP objects  to  that
exclusion as it constitutes a further  erosion  of  the  right  to  vote  by
citizens abroad. [Interjections.]

We welcome the fact that in every election we have not had major hurdles  in
disenfranchising citizens who qualify to vote. It is the  intention  of  the
department, the Independent  Electoral  Commission  and  the  Government  to
afford every qualifying citizen a vote in the  coming  election.  One  would
raise the spectra of the Bill having come late if one knew the date  of  the
coming election.

However, it is an unfortunate scenario that some of the  citizens  committed
acts that could not allow them to  participate  in  the  process,  and  that
others  could  not  collect  their  identity  documents  from  Home  Affairs
offices. And by so doing, they cannot participate in the process.

The Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs has done all it could  to  secure  a
place in the process for these citizens. But to this  day  the  decision  is
still left with individual voters to do what is right in order  to  exercise
their right to vote. Even on this podium one must urge  those  who  did  not
collect their identity documents from the offices  where  they  applied  for
them to go and collect them and register as voters as soon as  they  can  in
order for them to vote on  the  election  day.  The  hon  Minister  of  Home
Affairs  made  this  even  easier  by  offering  free  photos.  People   not
collecting their  identity  documents  they  themselves  have  applied  for,
raises many questions.  And  one  of  those  questions  is:  Is  there  some
ulterior motives?

It is not the function of Home Affairs  to  distribute  identity  documents,
but it is the responsibility of the applicant to collect his or her  ID.  We
have to applaud those officers who in their wisdom  had  to  walk  an  extra
mile  in  helping  with  the  distribution  of  these  documents.  We  would
encourage other officers working in tandem with stakeholders  also  to  help
with the process of distribution.

Those of us who were there  in  1994  expected  the  2004  elections  to  be
ushered in by a constituency-based election. We  appreciate  the  initiative
taken by the hon Minister of Home Affairs to keep his side of  that  mandate
by appointing an electoral task team under the chairmanship of  Dr  Van  Zyl
Slabbert to conduct research on  this  constitutional  mandate.  We  equally
thank individual members of the task team for the  work  that  they've  done
and for the unbiased results they produced.

It was quite interesting to see the ANC with its huge majority supporting  a
minority view of the task team which  support  necessitated  this  House  to
amend the Electoral Act of 1998 in order to hold  next  year's  election  on
the basis of that minority  view.  Those  are  the  dynamics  of  democracy;
bizarre as they are, but they are in order and democratic.

The IFP nonetheless supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S PILLAY:  Chair,  it  is  common  knowledge  that  this  legislation  is
absolutely essential. This Bill sets itself apart from  other  Bills  as  it
deals directly with elections to  the  national  Parliament  and  provincial
legislatures. Because it is so, we saw how  deep  emotions  were  evoked  by
certain persons. I'm not going to respond to  the  very  economical  use  of
facts by the DA representative, I've other things to discuss.

There are  many  clauses  in  the  Bill,  including  provisions  on  whether
prisoners should be allowed to vote or  not  -  if  yes,  what  category  of
prisoners? There are also clauses on hours  of  voting;  and  assistance  to
certain voters who are physically disabled - including blindness  and  other
visual impairment - who may be assisted by a person of their own choice.  It
also provides more clarity in  terms  of  route  changes  and  locations  of
mobile voting stations, and for parties that change their names.

A very important section deals with conditions that apply  whereby  the  IEC
may refuse to register a political party. Those  conditions  are  where  the
concerned party portrays propagation and incitement of violence  or  hatred,
or causes serious offence to any section of the population  on  the  grounds
of race, gender,  sex,  ethnic  origin,  colour,  sexual  orientation,  age,
disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture or  language;  and,  where
there is an indication that persons will not be admitted  to  membership  of
the party or welcomed as supporters of the party on  the  grounds  of  race,
ethnic origin or colour.

The Bill, obviously, allows people who are infirm, disabled and pregnant  to
apply for and cast  special  votes,  and  that  is  right  and  proper.  The
vulnerable  of  our  society  should  be  afforded   every   protection   by
legislatures and the state's implementing agencies.

I now point out that according  to  my  consultations  with  the  state  law
advisers - and their opinion was  confirmed  by  the  legal  team  from  the
Department of Home Affairs - geographical location is  not  a  consideration
when registering and voting are concerned, and where it affects the  infirm,
disabled or pregnant persons  whereby  such  condition  prevents  them  from
being at the voting district where they registered to vote, it will  be  for
this House to state whether or not that was the intention of that  piece  of
legislation.

It is a constitutional right of every South African to register as  a  voter
and to vote. The New NP supports all the provisions of the  Bill  and  moves
an amendment to clause 9 as indicated in the Order Paper of today. It  would
be ideal if the amendment proposed by the New NP could be accepted  by  this
House. However, if the amendment is not accepted,  the  New  NP  will  still
support the Bill.

We adopt this position in the light of the fact that  in  1999  we  took  to
court the matter of  whether  or  not  South  Africans  living  abroad  were
entitled to be provided with facilities to register and to  vote.  The  case
number was mentioned by the chairperson in which the applicant was  the  New
NP and the respondents  were  the  Chairman  of  the  Independent  Electoral
Commission, the Chief Electoral Officer of the IEC,  the  Minister  of  Home
Affairs and the Government  of  the  Republic  of  South  Africa.  The  same
matter, case no 10508/99, was enthusiastically supported by the FA and  both
cases were dismissed by the High Court.

In conclusion, it would be downright racist, devious and misleading  if  any
party pretended that this is  a  new  matter  and  that  circumstances  have
changed in any way since  the  1999  decision.  Such  deviousness  would  be
designed to mislead voters in the hope of obtaining some of their votes.  It
would be a hope in vain. Thank you. [[Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, hon Minister, at the outset of  the  discussions  on
the Bill the ACDP also voiced its objection that no provision had been  made
for special votes for South African citizens who, for a variety of  reasons,
were overseas.

Our hopes were somewhat raised when the electoral commission's proposal  was
accepted that clause 9(i) be  amended  to  allow  special  votes  due  to  a
temporary absence from  the  Republic  for  study,  employment  or  business
activities. Our  cautious  optimism  was,  however,  short-lived  because  a
twelfth-hour ANC amendment was accepted yesterday morning that  removed  any
possibility of even this narrow category of persons being entitled to  apply
for special votes.

Why should special provision be  made  only  for  Government  officials  and
their households to vote  overseas,  whilst  many  students,  employees  and
businessmen will now not even be able to  apply  for  special  votes?  There
must be thousands of such businessmen who  faithfully  contribute  to  South
Africa's gross national product and pay taxes in South Africa, but  who  are
now unable to even qualify for a special vote. It is for  this  reason  that
the ACDP garnered a lot of support and it might be  mentioned  that  the  SA
Council  of  Churches  also  supported  the  view  that  overseas  temporary
residents should be allowed to vote.

We find it totally unacceptable that certain prisoners should be allowed  to
vote, whilst law-abiding citizens who are temporarily  overseas  are  denied
an opportunity to vote. Is this exclusion constitutional? The ACDP finds  it
regrettable that a  lengthy  state  legal  opinion  was  obtained  regarding
prisoners' right to vote, whilst the constitutionality  of  overseas  voters
was not given the same attention.

The ACDP believes that the exclusion will  be  in  direct  contravention  of
sections 1(d) and 19(3) of the Constitution, which guarantee adult  citizens
the right to vote in elections. The question arises then whether  limitation
is justifiable and reasonable. We think not.

Citizens who are overseas  will  be  bitterly  disappointed  following  last
week's announcement that certain categories will be  entitled  to  vote.  We
believe that everything should be done to protect their right  to  vote  and
we are obtaining counsel's opinion in this regard. In  view  of  the  above,
the ACDP will not support this amending Bill. I thank you.

Mr P M  SIBANDE:  Chairperson,  Ministers,  hon  members  and  distinguished
guests ...

...  okokuqala  nje  inkulumo   yami   ngizoyinikela   kubo   bonke   abantu
baseNingizimu Afrika. Ngithi kubo i-ANC ithi  mabeze  bazobhalisela  ukhetho
futhi futhi bakhumbule nokulanda omazisi babo ukuze bakwazi  ukuthi  bathole
nemali yama-grants uHulumeni abethembise yona.

Inkulumo yami namhlanje ngizoyiqala ngokuxoxa le  ndaba.  Kwakukhona  indoda
eyayakhe indlu yayo maduzane nomgwaqo ophithizelayo. Le ndoda  yayikhuthele,
isebenza zonke izinsuku ihlanza igceke layo. Wonke umuntu  owayedlula  lapho
wayeyibongela  futhi  eyikhuthaza  ngenxa  yesivande   esihle   nokuhlanzeka
kwekhaya layo. Khona lapho kwakunenkawu eyayibukela uma  le  ndoda  isebenza
futhi izwa uma ababedlula beyitusa ngobunyoninco bayo.

Inkawu leyo  nayo  yacabanga  isu  engalenza  ngoba  nayo  ifuna  ukubongwa.
Yathatha ugodo olude yaluginqa phansi, yehla yenyuka  nalo  icabanga  ukuthi
izobongwa  njengale  ndoda.  Klibhi  klolo!  Abantu  bayibuka  nje.   Abanye
bafikelwa ukunengwa nokucasuka. Lokho-ke ngikubhekise  kumaqembu  aphikisayo
ngoba ahlale ephikisa zonke izindlela i-ANC eguqula ngazo izimpilo zabantu.

Abantu  bayamthanda  uKhongolose  futhi  bayambonga  ngenxa  yegalelo  lakhe
alenzayo emzabalazewni wokuqeda indlala. Izinhlangano eziphikisayo  zilibele
ukwehla zenyuka njengenkawu, zicabanga ukuthi abantu bakule ngabadi  yakithi
nasemhlabeni jikelele  bazobabonga  noma  bengenzanga  lutho.  Isisho  sithi
umuntu udla izithelo zomsebenzi wakhe. (Translation  of  isiZulu  paragraphs
follows.)

[... firstly, I dedicate my speech to all South Africans. I  would  like  to
tell them that the ANC invites them to  come  and  register  for  elections.
They also need to remember to fetch their identity documents  so  as  to  be
able to receive the grants that the Government promised them.

I will kick off my speech by narrating the following story. There  was  once
a man who built his house near a very busy road.  He  was  very  active  and
energetic. He cleaned his yard every day. Everyone  who  passed  by  praised
and encouraged him because of his beautiful garden and  the  cleanliness  of
his house. Nearby, a monkey used to observe that man when he  did  his  work
and when people praised him for his skillful activities.

The monkey sat down and thought  of  an  idea  through  which  it  could  be
praised as well. It took a long log and started  to  roll  it  up  and  down
because it expected to be praised, as had happened to the  man.  But  people
just looked at it. Others were angered and became contemptuous  towards  it.
I am directing that to the opposition parties  because  they  always  oppose
all strategies that the ANC employs towards changing the lives of people.

People love and appreciate  the  contribution  of  the  ANC  in  the  hunger
alleviation struggle. The opposition parties are behaving like  that  monkey
which went up and down, expecting the people of our  country  and  those  of
the whole world to thank them even if they have not done  anything.  An  old
adage says that one reaps what one sows.]

The main purpose of the Electoral Amendment Bill is to make  sure  that  the
people  are  able  to  vote  for  the  national  Government  and  provincial
governments, and to elect the leadership from the people's choice  who  will
lead this country by advancing democracy, but not reverse our  achievements.
I would like to remind all the opposition parties that  history  is  divided
into two: constructive history and destructive history.

UKhongolose  nguye  kuphela   onomlando   owakhayo   futhi   nguye   kuphela
ophokophele  phambili  ngezentuthuko  nokuthula  emhlabeni  wonke  jikelele.
Kodwa-ke, kulo mkhakha  wezomlando  obhidlizayo,  kunabafowethu  nodadewethu
abaqoka ukusetshenziswa njengezipanela zobasi  babo,  ngoba  yibo  obhongoza
nongqoshishilizi abampongoloza  kuqala  ukuthi  zibhuntshe  izinguquko  kule
ngabadi. Ngithi kubo asazi ukuthi  izingane  zethu  bayoziphendula  bathini;
futhi, uma sonke sesiwufulathele lo mhlaba bayofike bathini koyisemkhulu?

UKhongolose uthi kufanele kube nokuvota okuyisipesheli kulaba  abalandelayo:
abantu  ababona  kalufifi  noma  abakhubazekile  noma  abazithwele,   abantu
abalifulathele  leli   ngenxa   yemisebenzi   kaHulumeni,   abantu   abakude
kunezikhungo  zabo  zokuvota  ezigcemeni  ababhalisa  kuzo   abangabasebenzi
kwezokuvotisa noma  amalunga  ezokuphepha  ayobe  esemsebenzini  ngesikhathi
sokuvota.  Isexwayiso  sithi  wonke  umuntu  wakule  ngabadi  kufanele  enze
isiqiniseko sokuthi ubhalisile esigcemeni sangakubo  ukuze  abe  namalungelo
okuvota kule migomo ebekiwe.  (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The ANC is the only party with a record of being  constructive  and  it  is
the only party that strives to bring development and  peace  throughout  the
world. However, on the destructive side of things, we find  that  there  are
some of our brothers and sisters who have chosen to  be  used  as  tools  of
their bosses. They are the ones who vehemently  and  vociferously  shout  in
order to sabotage the changes in this country. To them I say: We don't  know
what they will say to our children. Also, when  all  of  us  have  departed,
what will they say when they meet their forefathers?

The ANC would like to see special  voting  arrangements  for  the  following
categories of people: those who are  partially  sighted,  the  disabled  and
those who are pregnant; those who  are  in  other  countries  on  Government
business; those who will be far from their voting stations and who  will  be
working for the IEC, or Defence Force members who will  be  on  duty  during
the voting period. A word of warning: All  people  of  this  country  should
ensure that they are registered in the voting stations nearest  to  them  in
order  to  be  eligible  for  voting  in  accordance  with  the   stipulated
regulations.]

During the general elections of 1999, the Independent  Electoral  Commission
made a special arrangement  for  South  Africans  who  are  based  in  other
countries to enable them to vote. This was done at enormous  financial  cost
to the IEC: an amount of R11 million. Only 3 000 people voted.  Everyone  in
this House will agree with me when I say that  we  have  limited  resources,
therefore we need to use the limited resources wisely.

Each one of us here should go out and mobilise our  people  to  go  and  get
their ID documents for them to be able to access their social services  from
our Government. Our people must be mobilised to go and register on 8  and  9
November for them to be able to vote in the next general elections.

Umbuzo omkhulu uthi:  Ngubani  okufanele  alandele  omunye,  ngabavoti  noma
ukhetho? Kunezigidigidi zabantu bokuzalwa lapha eNingizimu Afrika  okufanele
kube yibo abathola  ithuba  lokuvota  kodwa  omazisi  babo  abasesemahhovisi
omNyango  wezangaPhakathi,  kanti  abanye  banezinkinga   zokuthi   umnyango
awufinyeleli kubo ngendlela efanele. Kodwa ogimbelakwesabo  abakugqiziqakala
lokho. Kunokuba kuvote abantu  bakithi  eNingizimu  Afrika,  balibele  ukuba
ngobhongoza ezindabeni zaseZimbabwe.

I-ANC   iphakamisa   ukuthi,   kwabasemajele,   bonke   abantu    ababoshiwe
abangakagwetshwa  nabangakakhokhiswa  inhlawulo  kufanele  babe  namalungelo
okuvota,  kodwa-ke  kufanele  kube  ngabantu  ababhalisa  ezigcemeni  zakubo
ngaphambi kokuba baboshwe. Ngithanda ukukhumbuza  izinhlangano  eziphikisayo
ukuthi  i-ANC  kuphela  enozwelo  kubantu  bakithi  noma  bekusiphi   isimo.
Kufanele  kucace  njengoba  sihlangene  kule  Ndlu  ukuthi   onke   amaqembu
aphikisayo   aphikisana   nalesi   sichibiyelo   soMthetho   yila    maqembu
angagqiziqakala ngabantu bakithi abakhubazekile, abangaboni nabazithwele. I-
ANC  kuphela  ebanakekelayo  okungangokuba  kule  minyaka  eyedlule  indlela
ababephathwa ngayo  abantu  emajele  -  nesitebele  sezingulube  besingcono.
Abantu  bakithi  bebebandlululwa  nangokudla  imbala.   Abantu   abampisholo
bebenikwa   ukudla   okungenamsoco   futhi   okungenasilinganiso   kunalokho
okwakunikezwa abamhlophe.

Ngalokho ngicela ukuthi wonke umuntu waseNingizimu Afrika  enze  isiqiniseko
sokuthi uyovota ukuze sizivikele kulaba ngoba udaba akulona elokuthi  abantu
abaphesheya kuphela.  Bayala  nokuthi  abantu  abakhubazekile  baseNingizimu
Afrika  babe  namalungelo  angcono  okuvota,  nokuthi   siguqule   izindlela
zokwenza izinto lapho bevotela  khona  ukuze  bakwazi  ukuvota.  Ngiyabonga.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[The biggest question is this: Who should come first between the voters  and
the election? There are millions of indigenous  South  Africans  who  should
get an opportunity to vote, but their identity documents are in the  offices
of Home Affairs. Others are faced with a problem  regarding  the  fact  that
the department is not able to reach them. But those who are  selfish  simply
disregard that. Instead of focusing on  giving  our  people  the  chance  to
vote, they pontificate on Zimbabwean matters.

Regarding prisoners, the ANC proposes that all awaiting-trial prisoners  and
those waiting to be fined should have voting  rights.  But  they  should  be
people who  had  registered  in  their  voting  stations  before  they  were
arrested. I want to remind the opposition parties that the ANC is  the  only
party that is sympathetic to our people, no matter what condition they  find
themselves in. It should be clear, as we  are  congregated  in  this  House,
that all the opposition parties who are opposed to this amendment are  those
parties who do not care a bit for our disabled people, the blind  and  those
who are pregnant. It is only the ANC that  cares  for  them.  Pigsties  were
even better compared to the manner in which people were treated  in  prisons
during the previous years. Our people were discriminated against  even  when
it came  to  food.  Black  people  were  given  unhealthy  food  in  smaller
quantities compared to what was given to whites.

I therefore would like to appeal to every South African to ensure that  they
vote in order to protect us from these people because the  matter  does  not
end with those who are overseas only. They are also against the granting  of
better voting rights to disabled South Africans and  are  also  against  the
changing of voting procedures so that they could  be  able  to  vote.  Thank
you.]

The ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, do you have a  point  of
order?

UNGQONGQOSHE WEZOKUQONDISWA KWEZIGWEGWE: Sihlalo, nami uSibande  ngimshayela
ihlombe uma esho njalo. Manje uma ethi  uKhongolose  kuphela  ozwelana  nabo
bonke abantu abasemajele, mina angiyena uKhongolose kodwa yimina  engiphethe
amajele ngakho-ke bazwelwa yimi. [Ihlombe.] [Uhleko.] Ngiyabonga.

Mnu P M  SIBANDE:  Sihlalo,  kufanele  ngithi  uKhongolose  ngoba  le  lapho
siphuma   khona   kunabafowethu   abaningi    abangobhongoza    abangafundi.
Singakufihli lokho bahlonishwa bami ukuthi kukhona abafowethu  abangamalungu
anjengo  Louis  Nzimande  noWilma.  Sithi  thina  makube  nendlela   engcono
ezokwazi  ukubalungiselela  ukuthi  bakwazi  ukuzivotela   ngokwabo,   kodwa
kunamaqembu   athi   cha   mabangalungiselwa.   Ngalokho   i-ANC   iyaweseka
umThethosivivinywa. [Ihlombe.] (Translation of Zulu paragraphs follows.)

[The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, I would  also  like  to
congratulate Sibande on what he has said. Now, if he says it's only the  ANC
only that sympathises with all those who are in prisons, I  am  not  an  ANC
member but I am in charge  of  prisons  and  therefore  I  am  the  one  who
sympathises with them. [Applause.] [Laughter.] Thank you.

Mr P M SIBANDE: Chairperson, I have to say it's the  ANC  because  where  we
come from, many of  our  outspoken  brothers  are  not  able  to  read.  Hon
Ministers, we should not hide the fact that there are members such as  Louis
Nzimande and Wilma. We are saying that there  should  be  a  better  way  of
enabling them to vote on their own but there are parties who say no,  things
should not be made better for them. The ANC therefore  supports  this  Bill.
[Applause.]]

Dr C P MULDER: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister, the right to vote is the  most
basic and fundamental right that lies at the  heart  of  any  democracy.  We
claim to be a democracy and this ANC even goes so far as to  boast  that  we
are the most modern democracy in the world.

An HON MEMBER: Yes, we are!

Dr C P MULDER: Is this really true or not? Section  1  of  the  Constitution
lists the  founding  values  of  the  Republic.  Section  1(d)  states  that
universal adult suffrage is one of the  founding  values  of  the  Republic,
entrenched with a 75% majority.

Section 19(3)(a) of the Bill of Rights states, and I quote:


  Every  adult  citizen  has  the  right  to  vote  in  elections  for  any
  legislative body established in terms of the Constitution ...

However, to thousands of South African  citizens  these  words  will  remain
meaningless and will amount to empty, broken promises.  For  more  than  two
years now the FF has been campaigning that South African  citizens  who  are
registered and are temporarily outside the Republic  should  be  allowed  to
vote  in  the  2004  elections.  This  is  normal  practice  in  any  modern
democracy. Even citizens of Burundi who were abroad were allowed to vote  in
their  elections  recently.  We  are  not  talking  about  people  who  have
emigrated, but about law-abiding  citizens  from  all  communities  who  are
temporarily abroad.

When the original Bill went to Cabinet they were allowed to  vote.  When  it
came out of Cabinet they were no longer allowed to vote.  Despite  this,  we
believed that common sense  and  logic  would  prevail.  Last  Wednesday  we
succeeded. The ANC, without any reservations, supported  our  arguments  and
proposals that  South  African  citizens  who  were  temporarily  abroad  be
allowed to vote. They were convinced by common sense and basic  logic.  They
voted for and supported what they knew was right.

The committee adopted the amendment that allowed South African citizens  who
were temporarily abroad, either as students or as a  result  of  employment,
or  who  were  there  to  pursue  business  activities,  to  vote.  The  ANC
leadership was not amused. We then saw the  most  shameful  about-face  that
brought us to the position where, very cynically, this ANC  Government  made
provision that people employed by the state be allowed to vote.

But ordinary citizens  who  were  in  the  same  position  were  effectively
disenfranchised. Evidence before  the  portfolio  committee  indicated  that
they should be allowed to vote. The citizens who  signed  the  FF  petitions
said the same. The IEC said they could handle this. Even the  ANC  component
who listened and heard the evidence agreed and supported this.

So if you can't vote next year, thank the ANC  leadership.  They  took  your
vote away. This  morning  I  received  the  following  email  from  a  young
professional currently working in London, and I quote:


  I own property in South Africa. I am a citizen, I have the right to  vote
  in my own country. That is not my humble opinion. I pay taxes there, so I
  should have a say.

Don't dare call this the most modern democracy in the world  again,  because
it is not. We warned you, so we will see you in court. [Interjections.]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Chairperson and hon members ...
Mr H P CHAUKE: Chairperson, on a point of order: I am  not  sure  if  it  is
parliamentary for the hon Mulder to point his finger at  me  and  say:  ``We
will see you in court.'' Could you rule on that, please? [Interjections.]

Dr C P MULDER: Chairperson,  I  explained  that  through  this  Government's
policy, the ANC amended this Bill by taking out the provision that  made  it
possible for our citizens who were abroad to vote, and I said on  behalf  of
the FF that we would take this ANC Government to court, to allow  people  to
vote. [Interjections.]

The  CHAIRPERSON  OF  COMMITTEES:  Thank  you  for  that  explanation.   Hon
Mfundisi, please continue.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: An occasion like today reminds one  of  the  words  of  the
late Martin Luther King when he said, and I quote:


  In a sense, we have come to our nation's capital to cash a  cheque.  When
  the architects of  our  republic  wrote  the  magnificent  words  of  the
  constitution ... they were signing  a  promissory  note  to  which  every
  American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men ...

Yes, black men and white men -


  ... would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty  and  the
  pursuit of happiness.

The same can be said of us in South Africa.  However,  it  is  obvious  that
today South Africa is defaulting on this promissory note in so  far  as  the
citizens  at  large  are  concerned.  Instead  of   honouring   the   sacred
obligation, South Africa is giving the citizens overseas  a  bad  cheque,  a
returned cheque marked ``insufficient funds''.

We in the UCDP refuse to believe that the  bank  of  the  IEC  is  bankrupt.
After all, it is the IEC that proposed  the  amendment.  They  thought  they
were an independent commission, but have now  learnt  what  they  are.  Like
Martin Luther King, we refuse to believe that there are  insufficient  funds
in the great vaults of this nation.
We maintain that people don't just cease to be  South  Africans,  regardless
of where they find themselves. Imagine  folks  such  as  Mark  Shuttleworth,
Shaun Bartlett, Benny McCarthy,  Lucas  Radebe  and  all  others  not  being
allowed to vote after registering as voters. [Interjections.]

If we relish their goals, why not relish their votes? We believe  that  this
is the time for the ANC Government to make real the promises  on  democracy.
Actions should speak louder than words. This Government should realise  that
the destiny of South Africans abroad is tied up with ours in  this  country.
We should by no means indulge in an ostrich philosophy in  matters  relating
to national elections.

The Bill by and large addresses other concerns relating  to  elections,  but
we in the UCDP are put off by this particular  section.  Countries  such  as
Brazil cater for their  citizens  at  large  and  nearer  home;  Senegal  is
already planning what to do for their people in the coming elections.  South
Africa should serve as a torchbearer of democracy.
On that note, the UCDP will not support the Bill. [Interjections.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Mr Chairman, in the limited time at my  disposal,  allow  me
to say the following. A law on elections in a democratic country is  a  very
important piece of legislation. It must  advance  democracy.  It  must  also
ensure that there is no fraud of any kind and  that  the  playing  field  is
level for all participants in the elections.

This Bill says nothing about unequal funding and the  excessive  funding  of
the ruling party by the IEC. [Interjections.] If  there  is  to  be  genuine
talk of democracy in this country, the funding of parties must be  equitable
and should not be based on  the  1994  elections,  which  several  observers
admitted  were  not  as   clean   as   portrayed   in   this   country   and
internationally.

Floor crossing, which the PAC believes  encourages  political  prostitution,
violates the doctrine of retrospectivity and undermines the  whole  question
of proportional representation. This is not dealt with in  the  Bill.  Self-
seekers will, therefore, continue to further  their  personal  interests  at
the expense of  the  voters  and  the  poor,  whom  they  falsely  claim  to
represent. [Interjections.]

We agree that some prisoners must vote. They must  vote,  including  members
of the Azanian People's Liberation Army, who are languishing  in  the  jails
of  South  Africa  after  fighting  apartheid,  a  crime  against  humanity.
[Interjections.] The Constitution is the  basic  law  of  the  nation.  Izwe
lethu! [Our land!]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon Pheko! There is a point of  order.
Hon Bloem?

Mr D V BLOEM: Chairperson, is it in order for the member to make such a  big
noise? The Minister can't hear him properly! [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, if this was not taking  place  in
this House, I would say that what the hon member is  saying  is  balderdash!
[Laughter.]
Dr S E M PHEKO: I thank you, Minister. We don't want to come here  and  talk
politics. [Interjections.]

The land question has been betrayed by the ANC in this country!

Yiyo  le  nto  nihlala  ematyotyombeni.   Ngaba   bantu   abanithengisileyo.
Namhlanje bathengisa impahla  yombuso.  Nina  aninamali  yokuyithenga.  Baza
kuniqhatha.  Ze  nivotele  i-PAC.  [Uwelewele.]  La  madoda   anithengisile,
ewonke. Yiyo le nto benibizele  ukuza  kunixokisa  apha.  [Uwelewele.]  Izwe
lethu!  (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[That is why you live in shacks. These people have betrayed you;  they  have
sold you out. They are even selling  national  property.  You,  as  ordinary
people, do not have money to buy it. They are going  to  cheat  you.  Please
vote for the PAC. [Interjections.] These gentlemen have  betrayed  you.  Now
they have called you here to lie to you. [Interjections.] Our land!]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  Pheko,  please  return  to  the
podium.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Ndandinaye nalowo. [Uwelewele.] Andifun' ukubhoxwa  mna.  [I
was with that one too. [Interjections.] I do not want to be messed up.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon  Pheko,  your  speaking  time  has
expired.

Dr S E M PHEKO: Yes, I thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I was allowing you to respond  to  the  point
of order. Instead, you raised another topic.

Dr S E M PHEKO: What is the point of order?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Your time has expired, you may now leave  the
podium.

Dr S E M PHEKO: I thank you very much, but they  should  not  betray  people
here and tell lies, just because  of  their  so-called  majority.  We  shall
follow the light! We shall follow the sun, not big crowds. We  don't  follow
the crowds here, we follow the light. Izwe  lethu!  [Our  land!]  Long  live
Hintsa! [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, can we have order in  the
House?  Please  take  your  seats.  [Interjections.]  Order,  hon   members!
[Interjections.] I will wait until we have silence in the House.

Hon member Pheko, you did not listen to the Chair. Your  speaking  time  had
expired. I allowed you to respond to the point of  order  that  was  raised,
but you continued to abuse the opportunity that I had given  you.  We  would
like you to apologise to the House for that behaviour.

Dr S E M PHEKO: There was a lot of noise, Mr Chairman. I did not  hear  what
you were telling me to do, so the blame should really go to those who,  when
we are debating here, are holding their own conferences over there.

I will apologise to the Chair, but the Chair must be aware of the  cause  of
my not having heard its instruction.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I will accept your apology, hon  member,  but
please, hon members,  let  us  not  disregard  the  rulings  of  the  Chair,
especially on the issue of the time that has been allocated to  the  various
parties.

The next speaker is the hon Rajbally. Are you rising on a point of order?

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Yes, Chair. I am very bothered, because this should  be  an
unconditional apology. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Sikakane, I have  accepted  the  apology.
Are you asking the Chair not to accept the apology?

Mr M R SIKAKANE: Chair, to a certain extent.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: No, we cannot do that. Please  continue,  hon
Rajbally.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson. The  term  is  certainly  making  a
fast exit and the election bustle for organisations has arrived. As to  when
the elections will be held is a question on which we are certainly all  kept
waiting. It would be of great assistance if this decision were  to  be  made
soon, in order to enable all  parties  to  do  their  constituency  work  as
scheduled.

In the light of the amending Bill, no objection  is  made  to  limiting  the
application of the Electoral Act of 1998 in respect of municipal  elections.
Furthermore, the revision  of  provisions  on  voter  registration,  voters'
roll, voting districts, voting stations and voting  hours  is  supported  in
the light of such revisions benefiting  the  voting  process  by  making  it
effective and efficient within our constitutional parameters.

The repeal of absolute provisions is supported. Further,  the  MF  does  not
pardon criminals for their injustices in  this  country,  but  respects  the
fact that they belong to this country and have entitlements such as  voting.
Taking  this  into  consideration,  provisions   made   for   awaiting-trial
prisoners to vote is supported.

Provisions made for dispute management and assistance  to  disabled  persons
is supported, as this is a constitutional duty. Further,  it  is  felt  that
the alterations, deletions, additions and  clarification  are  necessary  in
determining authority and duty boundaries.

Lastly, the registration of political parties is crucial for our  democracy,
and the MF is pleased that provision is made for this. The MF  supports  the
Electoral Laws Amendment Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Chair, on a point of order: The last speaker was able to  be
heard because she speaks loudly, but there is a tremendous amount  of  noise
in here. The Minister has already made  an  appeal  about  this.  Could  you
please appeal to the members to listen to this debate. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I must  ask  the  Whips  to  assist  us  with
keeping order in the House because  calls  from  the  Chair  have  not  been
responded to favourably.

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, it is  quite  ironic  that  yesterday  we  saw
President Mbeki making a plea on television that Afro-Americans be  regarded
as part of Africa and not be left in the cold  just  because  they  live  in
another country. [Interjections.]

But, hon member, the same sentiments are shockingly lacking  when  it  comes
to South African citizens. Maybe they look a little different from the  ones
the President was talking about,  but  they  are  bona  fide  South  African
citizens born and bred, not in  America  or  the  Caribbean,  but  in  South
Africa.  They  are  abroad  only  temporarily,  but  have  been   shamefully
disenfranchised.

Dis 'n skande. Dis dubbele standaarde. In 1994 kon  Suid-Afrikaners  in  die
buiteland stem, net oor een rede: baie  ANC-ondersteuners  was  toe  nog  in
exile. Toe almal terug is in die kraal, word  die  hek  eensydig  toegemaak.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This is a shame. These are double standards. In 1994 South  Africans  could
vote abroad, for one reason only: many ANC supporters were  still  in  exile
at the time. When every one was back in  the  kraal,  the  gate  was  closed
unilaterally.]

South Africans are shamefully disenfranchised. [Interjections.]

Intussen belas minister Trevor Manuel hulle op inkomste  wat  hulle  in  die
buiteland verdien. Daar  kan  net  een  rede  daarvoor  wees:  die  ANC  het
``benoude boude''; hulle is bang dat 'n  halfmiljoen  kiesers  oorsee  hulle
hul plek in die Regering sal kos. [Tussenwerpsels.]  Tyd  en  geld  word  as
redes aangegee. Die OVK het gesê die geld is reg daarvoor.  Die  agb  Chauke
het in reaksie op besware gesê daar  is  300 000  ID-boekies  wat  nog  moet
afgehaal word.

Die NA doen in die lig van hierdie verklaring 'n  dringende  oproep  op  die
Regering om dan die verkiesing uit te stel. Die ANC het 'n obsessie  om  die
verkiesing te laat saamval met die 10-jaar babelaas  in  April.  Dit  is  'n
deursigtige poging om  die  feesvierings,  die  sukseseuforie  wat  daardeur
geskep word en die R1,3 miljard wat daarvoor begroot  word  te  misbruik  om
die regerende party in die verkiesing te bevoordeel.

Volgens die Grondwet kan ons tot in September verkiesing hou. Stel dit  uit.
Dis die regte ding om te doen en dit gee ons mense hier en in die  buiteland
die kans om hulle demokratiese reg uit te oefen. Die  NA  sal  teen  hierdie
wetsontwerp  stem,  en  ons  doen  dit  met  groot  graagte.  Ek   dank   u.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In the meantime Minister Trevor Manuel taxes them on income earned by  them
abroad. There can be only one reason for this: The ANC are  panicking;  they
are afraid that half a million voters abroad are going to  cost  them  their
place in the Government. [Interjections.] Time and money are being given  as
reasons. The IEC has said that there is enough money. The hon  Chauke  said,
reacting to objections, that there are 300 000 ID books that still  have  to
be collected.

In view of this  statement  the  NA  is  making  an  urgent  appeal  to  the
Government to postpone the election. The ANC is  obsessed  with  making  the
election coincide with the 10-year hangover in April. It  is  a  transparent
attempt to abuse the festivities, the euphoria of success created by it  and
the R1,3 billion budgeted  for  it  to  benefit  the  ruling  party  in  the
election.

According to the Constitution we  can  hold  an  election  until  September.
Postpone it. That is the right thing to do and would give  our  people  here
and abroad the chance to exercise their democratic right. The NA  will  vote
against this legislation, and we shall do so with  pleasure.  I  thank  you.
[Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I  now  call  the  hon  P  M  Mathebe.
[Applause.] [Interjections.]

Mr P M MATHEBE: Shut up, Sakkie. Thank you, Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and
other Ministers in the House. Chairperson, there has been  a  lot  of  noise
about overseas voters  in  this  House.  I  think  I  must  put  the  record
straight. They are our fellow South Africans. We love  them,  we  appreciate
their patriotism and we think that wherever  they  are  they  are  doing  us
proud. They are representing us, and are our people. I think  that  most  of
them would be happy to see  the  meagre  resources  that  we  have  in  this
country being channelled where they are most needed.

In the last election the IEC  spent  many  millions  of  rands  on  overseas
voters. But, as the chairperson has already indicated,  only  a  few  turned
up. So how can you spend these millions on people who do not  even  respond?
[Interjections.] Most of these people who are overseas ...  [Interjections.]
Shut up.

I think that most of these people who are overseas would be happier  to  see
all these resources being spent inside the country, because  people  in  the
rural areas in the last elections couldn't go  to  the  voting  stations  as
they were far apart. [Applause.] So if we spend these resources  inside  the
country to increase the number  of  these  voting  stations  and  districts,
people will be able to vote. Most of the people who are  overseas  would  be
happy to see that happen. [Interjections.] Shut up.

Now, the hon Pretorius, to come here and create this wrong impression  about
this Bill is really disgusting, Sakkie.

An HON MEMBER: ``The hon'' Sakkie.

Mr P M MATHEBE: He is `` the hon'', of course.  But  this  man  has  totally
lost his soul - the hon Sakkie. He  has  totally  lost  his  soul.  I'm  not
surprised to hear him say all this nonsense. [Interjections.]  That  is  the
reason why he has defected to the DA, a party which  refuses  to  cross  the
threshold into the new South Africa, a party that can only be  described  as
the dumping ground of  all  the  reactionary  and  insane  elements  of  our
society. [Laughter.] [Applause.]  [Interjections.]  You  shut  up!  You  are
stupid. That's why you went bald at such an early age. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES. Order! Hon  member,  can  you  withdraw  that
remark please? Hon Mathebe, can you withdraw that remark please?

Mr P M MATHEBE: I withdraw, Comrade Chairperson. [Interjections.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Are you sure you withdraw it? That's the  silliest  thing  you
have ever said. [Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Please continue, hon member.

Mr P M MATHEBE: Now, Chairperson, coming  to  the  hon  Dr  Mulder.  Really,
after listening to what he was saying here, one is obliged to think that  he
can only be a doctor of animals, because he doesn't have  the  interests  of
the  people  at  heart.  [Laughter.]  [Interjections.]  Your  party  applies
subjective principles in all its proposals and decisions. It always  applies
principles which are to the benefit of the minority and to the detriment  of
the whole of South Africa. So, I think,  you  are  still  pursuing  the  old
ideas of your late father, Dr Connie Mulder,  who  denied  the  majority  of
people who were in this country the right to vote.

I now come to Mr Swart, the hon poor Mr Swart. I think that I mustn't  waste
much  of  my  time  on  you,  because  you  don't   warrant   such   serious
consideration. [Interjections.] You attended one meeting  of  our  portfolio
committee. When we deliberated on this Bill you were nowhere  to  be  found,
but you come here and waste our time and speak all this  nonsense.  I  think
you must stop portraying yourself as a Christian party, because you  are  in
reality an unholy party. [Laughter.] It's inclemency when  the  majority  of
these people are living in misery.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member!

Mr K M ANDREW: Mr Chairman, you can't have a member of  Parliament  standing
up  and  referring  to  a  party  as  an  unholy   party.   [Interjections.]
[Laughter.] Surely that is unparliamentary? This  man  is  overstepping  all
decent bounds in Parliament.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  Mathebe,  can  you  rise?  You  have  on
several occasions used the words ``shut up''  and  other  very,  very  crude
language. Can you please contain yourself.

Mr P M MATHEBE: [Inaudible.] ... bald-headed stupid ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon  member!  Hon  Mathebe,  please!  We  are
asking you to contain yourself.

Mr P M MATHEBE: I will, Chairperson, but you must also  ask  the  hon  bald-
headed man to keep quiet. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Mulder?

Dr C P MULDER: I rise on a point of order, Chairperson. The remarks made  by
this hon member are an absolute disgrace  to  this  House  and  an  absolute
disgrace to our democracy. I would like you to ask him to leave the  podium.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Mathebe, can  you  take  this  seriously?
Can you withdraw that remark?

Mr P M MATHEBE: I withdraw, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have made a ruling, Mr Andrew. We  want  to
continue with the debate. I've ruled, and the member has withdrawn.

Mr K M ANDREW: Which remark, Chair?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The last remark about the ACDP.

Mr K M ANDREW: There  is  a  further  remark,  Chair.  Earlier  in  the  hon
member's speech, he made a derogatory reference to the hon  Mr  Ellis.  When
you asked him to please contain himself just a minute or  so  ago,  he  then
proceeded to say, ``If you tell that bald-headed man  to  behave  himself''.
[Interjections]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members!

Mr K M ANDREW: Chair, the fact that in  the  very  same  speech  about  five
minutes ago you asked the hon member and obliged  him  to  withdraw  exactly
the same remark and that he now uses exactly  the  same  terminology  is,  I
believe, contempt of the  Chair  and  a  withdrawal  in  itself  is  not  an
adequate admonition.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Mathebe, I am going to warn you  for  the
last time about the remarks that you are making.
Mr P M MATHEBE: Thank you, Chair, but I think you will  give  me  much  more
time because they have wasted much of my time. I now come to the hon  member
Mr Pheko.

Morwarre, o kweša bohloko go tla mo go tlo tlatša lešata leo  o  bego  o  le

[Nako e fedile.] [Legowa.] (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[Mr P M MATHEBE: My brother, it is so disappointing to  see  you  come  here
and be as rowdy as you were. What do the people say if a leader of a  party,
does this? You are telling people that the PAC is a rowdy party, it  is  not
a party that wants to progress. Let me  tell  you  something,  I  heard  you
telling us that people come out in their multitudes to go and vote for  PAC.
Now, I do not know which ones you are referring to because there  are  many.
You should have explained clearly which PAC you were talking about.  Now,  I
would like to make an appeal to all my fellow people that we, the  ANC,  and
the others in  here  who  are  sober-minded,  should  put  on  end  to  this
regulation. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon  members,  I  would  like  to
thank  all  who  have  participated  in  this  debate.  I  noted   all   the
contributions made and I am mindful that one hopes that the  debate  on  the
electoral law will not stop here.

I just want to make minor corrections in relation to  the  suggestions  made
by the chairperson of the portfolio committee that  it  was  the  opposition
parties  that  concluded  that  the  system   should   change   to   enhance
accountability. It was the task team that suggested the changes. I  want  to
emphasise that, as the hon Prince Zulu suggested, it is first  and  foremost
the duty of an ID applicant to collect that document from Home  Affairs.  We
do our utmost to help them, especially since our people are poor and do  not
have money when it comes to transport.

In relation to the point about wasted resources, I hope the  threats  by  Dr
Mulder will just be made here in Parliament and that they would  not  really
go to court. Unless we are sure you are going to court, we cannot  say  that
the money that we are going to spend will not be a waste  of  resources.  Of
course, when the court case takes place, I will be cited as  the  person  to
be pursued.

Much of what has  been  said  by  both  those  who  support  and  those  who
criticise,  may  be  taken  into  account  during   the   continued   policy
formulation in respect of the electoral law.  And  I  trust  that  the  next
Parliament of South Africa which will be elected during the  elections  next
year will take a better and wider consideration to the relationship  between
the people of South Africa and their political representatives.  As  Cabinet
indicated the draft Bill  prepared  by  the  electoral  task  team  will  be
submitted to Parliament after next year's elections and that will  give  the
opportunity for many of the contributions that were made during  the  debate
to be taken on board.

Instead of dealing with the specific  aspects  raised  during  this  debate,
which should be addressed during future debate I think it is important  that
we focus on the  next  elections  and  express  in  this  House  the  shared
commitment to ensure that next year's elections are indeed  free  and  fair.
For elections to be free and fair one needs to have more than  just  a  lack
of incidents or the absence of intimidation.

In my opinion it is essential that the people of South African gain a  clear
understanding of what  elections  are  indeed  all  about  in  a  democratic
dispensation. In 1994 we  provided  extensive  election  training  to  teach
people how to vote. In 1999 we provided no  relevant  training  at  all.  In
2004 we must make a shared commitment for all in this House  to  assist  the
majority of the South African people to understand  why  they  vote.  It  is
essential that our people understand that voting is the moment during  which
they  vote  to  hold  their  government  accountable  and  they  have   this
opportunity once in a five-year period. They must realise that voting  is  a
critical activity which must focus their assessment of the issues  affecting
our country, not just on the basis of loyalty to any of our parties.  Voting
should not be regarded as an act of allegiance to those  who  are  in  power
and people should not feel that their summons to this House pays  homage  to
us by voting for us. Voting is the time when the people of South Africa  are
sovereign and they may hire or fire each one of us  and  decide  who  is  to
rule the country. Until each and every voter feels that he  or  she  has  in
his or her hands the power to hire and fire anyone in this House,  including
the President, our democracy will not have achieved its final goal  and  our
people will not be free.

We have passed laws in this House, but democracy is not just  about  passing
the 800 pieces of legislation that we have passed. It is  in  the  practices
of government and in the hearts and minds of the people of  our  country.  I
wish to conclude with a  plea  to  all  in  this  House,  that  through  our
activities we can supplement the insufficient voter education in respect  of
why people should vote. Only by making people understand that they have  the
powers to hire and fire, will each one of us then become  bound  to  embrace
the culture of service. We will act for what we all have  to  be,  which  is
nothing more than serving our people, who are our only masters.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Question put: That the following amendment on the Order Paper,  proposed  by
Mr I J Pretorius, be agreed to:


  Amendment of section 33 of Act 73 of 1998


         9. Section 33 of the Electoral Act, 1998, is hereby amended by  the
              substitution for subsection (1) of the following subsection:

Question put: That the following amendment on the Order Paper,  proposed  by
Mr S Pillay, be agreed to:


  Amendment of section 33 of Act 73 of 1998


9.    Section 33 of the Electoral  Act,  1998,  is  hereby  amended  by  the
     addition at the end of subsection (1) of the following paragraph:


              (e) absence from the Republic, for a period not exceeding five
                  years and still holding a valid  South  African  passport:
                  Provided that such person may only vote  for  an  election
                  for the National Assembly.

Amendment  negatived  (New  National  Party,  Democratic  Alliance,  Inkatha
Freedom Party, African Christian Democratic Party, Freedom  Front,  National
Action and Federal Alliance dissenting).
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I  rise  on  a  point  of
order: The intention is to seek some clarity. The other parties  have  stood
up to say that they want their objections noted. What are they objecting  to
because we are the ones that object to a particular amendment? [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: It would appear that they  are  objecting  to
the rejection of the amendments.

Mr  J  P  I  BLANCHÉ:  Chairperson,  should   I   call   for   a   division?
[Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: In respect of the member asking for  a
division, he should also be conscious of the fact that he is not allowed  to
do so as he is not the sponsor of the particular amendment. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon member is in a position to  call  for
a division, however he has to secure a sufficient number to do so.  Are  you
calling for a division?
Mr J P I BLANCHÉ: Chairperson, I am objecting to the amendment.

Question put: That the Bill be read a second time.

Division demanded.

The  MINISTER  OF  HOME  AFFAIRS:  Hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members,  the
Constitution of the Republic of SA ushered in  a  new  dispensation  in  the
constitutional history of  this  country.  Of  utmost  significance  is  the
provision that the Constitution is the supreme  law  of  the  Republic,  and
that any law or conduct inconsistent with it  is  invalid,  and  obligations
imposed by it, must in fact, be fulfilled.

The Department of Home Affairs,  in  its  attempts  to  realign  legislation
under  its  administration  with  the  Constitution,  has   identified   the
Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Bill as one of those pieces  of
new legislation to be introduced in line with the Bill  of  Rights  and  the
democratic  values  of  human  dignity,  equality  and  freedom  which   are
enshrined in our Constitution.

This follows the recommendations of the South African Law Commission,  which
were submitted to the then Minister of Justice, Dr A M  Omar,  a  member  of
Parliament. The main objective of this Bill is to  make  provision  for  any
person who has undergone a sex change operation, either  by  surgery  and/or
medical treatment, so that such person has the sex organs  of  the  opposite
sex to his or her biological sex. [Laughter.] This person may apply  to  the
Director-General of the Department of Home Affairs  for  the  alteration  of
his or her sex description in the national population register.

The Bill provides that an application for the  alteration  of  the  person's
sex description shall  be  accompanied  by  the  birth  certificate  of  the
applicant, reports from the medical practitioners who performed any  of  the
processes resulting in the sex  change,  and  a  report  by  an  independent
medical practitioner who  did  not  take  part  in  the  processes  but  has
performed an examination of the sex appearance of the person concerned.

The Bill further provides that the Director-General of  Home  Affairs  shall
furnish written reasons for any refusal to register such an  applicant.  The
applicant  can  approach  the  magistrate's  court   in   the   district   -
Chairperson, I thought this was a matter of interest to all of  us,  whether
male or female - in which he or she resides for  an  order  authorising  the
change of his or her sex description. The application  to  the  magistrate's
court shall be accompanied by  all  documents  submitted  to  the  Director-
General of Home Affairs, together with the reasons  for  refusals  to  alter
the sex description.

Upon registration of the  altered  sex  description,  the  person  concerned
shall be legally deemed for all purposes -  listen  to  this  -  to  be  the
person of the new sex description. The Bill also seeks to amend  the  Births
and Deaths Registration Act 51 of 1992, as amended, by the  insertion  of  a
new section after section 24 thereof to provide for the Director-General  of
Home Affairs to order that the sex description of a  person  be  altered  in
the birth register and an amended birth certificate be issued accordingly.

In other words, the Bill introduces the following  provisions:  It  provides
for the procedures and requirements which an applicant, who has undergone  a
sex  change  operation  or  treatment,  and/or  evolvement  through  natural
development resulting in sex change, must follow  to  enable  the  Director-
General of Home Affairs to alter his or her sex description in the  National
Population Register. It further provides for the manner  in  which  refusals
by the director-general must be made, and the processes to  be  followed  by
the applicant to appear before the magistrate, either in person or  assisted
by a legal practitioner.

It provides for the acknowledgement of the  alteration  of  sex  appearance,
where the application to alter the sex description in terms of clause 1  has
been granted, either by the director-general  or  an  order  issued  by  the
magistrate. This clause makes provision that the  person  concerned,  shall,
from the date of the recording  of  the  national  population  register,  be
legally deemed for all purposes - listen to this to be  the  person  of  the
sex description so recorded.

It provides that the rights and obligations that have been  acquired  by  or
accrued to  such  a  person,  before  the  alteration  of  his  or  her  sex
description are not adversely affected by the alteration. The Bill seeks  to
amend Births and Deaths Registration Act  51  of  1992  as  amended  by  the
insertion of a  new  clause,  which  allows  the  Director-General  of  Home
Affairs to order the alteration of the sex description of a  person  in  the
national  population  register  and  issue  an  amended  birth   certificate
accordingly. Furthermore, it provides for the short title of the Bill  being
the Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Bill.  So  it  is  exciting
that it gives each one of us a chance to  cross  over.  [Laughter.]  I  urge
this House to accept the Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status  Bill.
I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms A VAN WYK: Hon Chairperson, hon Ministers,  members  of  the  House,  the
Bill before the House follows a report to the then Minister for Justice  and
Constitutional Development, Minister Omar, into the  legal  consequences  of
sexual realignment and related matters.

The  Law  Commission's  report  made   certain   recommendations   regarding
legislation providing for the application to the  Director-General  of  Home
Affairs for the alteration of a person's sex  description  in  the  national
population register. The Bill deals with  the  actual  application  for  the
alteration of the sex description to the director-general. It sets  out  the
requirements for such application, the manner in which the  director-general
has to deal with a refusal to register, and the  steps  that  the  applicant
may take if the application was unsuccessful.

It  further  obliges  the  director-general  to  register  the  altered  sex
description in terms of the amendment to the Births and Deaths  Registration
Act of 1992, and amends the Births and Deaths Registration Act by  inserting
a section dealing with the issuing of an amended birth  certificate  to  the
person concerned.

The Bill before the  House  is  another  example  of  the  fact  that  South
Africa's Constitution is a living document that impacts on and improves  the
quality of life of all our people. It also  bears  testimony  to  the  ANC's
commitment to respecting freedom of choice and promoting equality. The  Bill
of Rights, as contained  in  our  Constitution,  guarantees,  amongst  other
things, the right to privacy, dignity and freedom of choice,  and  prohibits
discrimination based on sex, gender and social orientation.

However, in the absence of this Bill, these basic rights of individuals  are
ignored and violated. Furthermore, we have the peculiar situation  in  South
Africa that South African laws allow for sex  change  procedures,  but  deny
people who have undergone a sex reassignment procedure  to  have  their  new
sex reflected in the births register and on  their  ID  document.  The  Bill
before the House will correct this ambiguous situation.

In dealing with this Bill, the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs  received
a number of written submissions  and  held  public  hearings.  The  evidence
brought before the committee was compelling. It was clear from the  numerous
personal experiences that were relayed to the portfolio committee  that  the
nonrecognition of their sex status impacted negatively on  their  lives  and
the rights that they ought to enjoy by virtue of  our  Bill  of  Rights,  as
enshrined in our Constitution.

I would like to share with the House a few of  these  submissions  from  the
hearings that we held. One submission said: ``The banks are the worst;  they
absolutely refuse to change your sex details.  I  will  not  have  a  credit
card, because can you imagine that every time you use your card you have  to
explain your personal life in public?''

Another said: ``I have considered obtaining a false ID, but why should I  be
forced to become a criminal? I want to conform and be normal.  Home  Affairs
are branding us and attaching a number to us. It  is  similar  to  the  past
when our identity documents reflected our race  groups.  Why  are  we  being
branded?''

Other practical implications include the inability to obtain a passport,  to
open a bank account, continual harassment in respect of the  utilisation  of
public facilities and producing a drivers'  licences.  Though  it  might  be
true that the amendment  of  identity  documents  will  not  in  itself  end
discrimination against transsexual people,  it  will,  however,  remove  the
last  basis  on  which  discrimination  can  be  legally   facilitated   and
legitimated.

During its deliberations, the committee made certain  amendments.  The  most
important of these are the following sections. Section  1(2)(b)  deals  with
the documentation that must accompany an application.  Where  it  originally
required a report by the surgeon who  carried  out  the  procedure,  it  was
decided to broaden this to any surgeon  qualified  and  experienced  in  the
field. The reason for this is a practical one.  A  practitioner  might  have
relocated and it might be impossible to locate such a  practitioner,  or  he
or she may have become unavailable due to death or disability.

The original section 1(3)  required  the  director-general  to  furnish  the
applicant with written reasons for refusal, unless  the  reasons  have  been
made public. It is clear that this would would infringe on a person's  right
to privacy and dignity if such reasons are made public.  The  amendment  now
obliges the director-general to provide the applicant with  written  reasons
for refusal and removes the scenario of making such reasons public.

The ANC supports, with enthusiasm, the Bill before the House. It  was  clear
to us, however, that  the  department  failed  to  consult  broadly  enough,
specifically as far as  consultation  was  concerned  with  interest  groups
representing those directly affected by the Bill. Because of that, the  Bill
fails in making adequate provision for intersex persons, whose physical  sex
is ambiguous and objectively indeterminate from birth.

According to Australian law, an intersex person is a person who, because  of
a genetic condition, was born with reproductive organs  or  sex  chromosomes
that are not exclusively male or female. And, may I say, this is the  latest
definition in international law. The Bill, as it stands, affords  no  relief
to those whose sex organs are ambiguous and who are unwilling or  unable  to
submit  to  radical  and,  indeed,  potentially   life-threatening   genital
surgery.

Intersex and transsexual people are different, their  needs  are  different,
and the discrimination they face is different. An  intersex  person  is  one
who was born with reproductive organs that are neither exclusively male  nor
female, whereas a transgender person identifies as a member of  a  different
sex to the one they were born as.  Both  of  these  communities  often  face
discrimination, and it is important that our laws  reflect  their  different
needs.

The Bill provides for transsexuals, but fails to address the specific  needs
of intersex persons. This group now finds itself in a  legal  limbo,  unable
to exercise civil rights which are generally taken for granted.  It  is  for
this reason that  the  ANC  will  recommend  to  the  NCOP  to  consider  an
amendment that will address the needs of intersex people.

The department was instructed, during the process  of  public  hearings,  to
work on these amendments, but failed to do so in time. They  should  see  to
it that they are ready for this once the NCOP starts to  deliberate  on  the
Bill. An amendment to the  Bill  should  make  provision  for  the  intersex
person's nominated gender.

Following the  submissions  to  the  committee  and  legal  developments  in
various parts of the world and specifically the UK and Australia during  the
past six months, the ANC believes that a possible solution lies  in  stating
explicitly in section 1(1) that these measures apply to any  person  who  is
intersex. Intersex people can then further be required, on  application  for
alteration  of  their  sex   description,   to   provide   medical   reports
corroborating that they are indeed intersex.

Furthermore, an intersex person should be required to  provide  evidence  in
the form of a report by a psychiatrist, a social worker or other in  support
of  the  application.  Such  a  report  should  confirm  and   support   the
application  that  the  applicant   has   been   established,   stable   and
satisfactory, up to the present, for an unbroken  period  of  at  least  two
years in the nominated gender role  corresponding  to  the  sex  description
that is sought.

In conclusion, I would like to share with this House  an  extract  from  one
submission specifically, that we received. I think it  will  explain  better
to us all the difficulties these fellow South Africans have to deal with:


  As I grew up the feelings inside of me grew and I felt myself being  torn
  between my love and loyalty to my family and the strange feelings  inside
  of me. I could not talk to anyone.  The  very  mention  of  the  TS  word
  brought out the worst in all those around me. I began to realise  that  I
  would never be accepted, and that if I were to continue with  my  journey
  to womanhood, that I would  lose  my  family  and  forever  be  a  social
  outcast. Then something happened which changed my whole outlook on  life.
  A new South Africa was born and with it came a new hope. To  cut  a  long
  story short, I overcame my fears and today my family and I are working to
  resolve our differences. It has not been easy for either of us,  but  I'm
  happy to say that we are still a family.

Based  on  the  founding  values  of  our  democracy,   enshrined   in   our
Constitution  are  human  dignity,  the  achievement  of  equality  and  the
advancement of  human  rights  and  freedom.  The  ANC  supports  the  Bill.
[Applause.]

Mr I J PRETORIUS: Chairperson, the DA  also  supports  this  amending  Bill.
After listening to submissions to the Portfolio Committee on  Home  Affairs,
I was reminded of the trauma and difficulties  that  people  experience  who
have  undergone  surgical  and  medical  treatment  to  alter  their  gender
alignment. The procedure for application to alter the sex description  of  a
person is also set out in the Bill.

Owing to an oversight or indifference during the drafting of the Births  and
Deaths Registration Act of 1992, no provision was made in the Act  to  amend
the birth register after the sex description of a person had  been  altered.
After the application has been granted an amended  birth  certificate  shall
be issued.

This amendment also allows people  who  have  undergone  gender  realignment
operations to once again take their full place in society. They will now  be
able to get identity documents which reflect their new gender and  identity,
which will enable them to register to vote or access  social  benefits  such
as pensions, just like every other South African citizen.

The portfolio committee also agreed to investigate the whole  issue  further
at a later stage to address any remaining anomalies.  The  DA  supports  the
Bill because it brings the Births and Deaths Registration Act in  line  with
the Bill of Rights in our Constitution. Thank you.

Ms I MARS: Deputy Chairperson, hon Minister and hon members,  today  we  are
dealing with the Alteration of Sex Description  and  Sex  Status  Bill,  and
therefore it is important that we are very clear  about  why  this  Bill  is
necessary.

Under the previous dispensation, that is Act 81 of 1963,  a  specific  group
of  people  were  allowed  by  law  to  apply  for  the  alteration  of  sex
description in the birth register. The Act referred specifically  to  people
who had undergone a sex reassignment.

The Act did, of course, have  certain  requirements.  It  was  necessary  to
obtain a recommendation from the secretary of health  to  the  secretary  of
the interior to enable the latter, if deemed necessary, to call for  medical
reports and institute investigation on the applicant's sex reassignment.
It was very interesting and touching to hear evidence from a woman  who  had
successfully  applied  for,  and  been  granted,  alteration  of   her   sex
description in terms of this legislation. The year 1992  is  significant  as
the then government  repealed  the  Act,  and  currently,  people  who  have
undergone sex reassignment treatment  are  not  able  to  have  their  birth
certificate changed, hence this new piece of legislation.

The Bill before us remedies this situation by providing for  the  alteration
of sex description of certain individuals under  certain  circumstances  and
amending the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1992.  Clause  1  of  the
Bill deals with  the  physical  requirements  for  the  application  to  the
Director-General of Home Affairs. Clause 3  inserts  section  27A  into  the
Births and Deaths Registration Act, which is a consequential  amendment  and
allows the director-general to  alter  the  sex  description  on  the  birth
register.

We feel that in many ways this Bill merely reverts to the  situation  before
the 1992 provision, which rescinded rights previously enjoyed by people  who
had successfully undergone sex reassignment treatment. However,  during  the
public hearing it became evident that this particular Bill only  deals  with
a very specific group of  people  -  much  concern  was  expressed  that  no
provision was made for transsexual and transgender people - and  affords  no
relief  for  people  who  are  unwilling  to  undergo  surgery  or   medical
treatment.

We would ask the committee and the department to take  cognisance  of  these
submissions made to the portfolio committee in order to investigate  if  and
how these submissions can form a basis for  dialogue  and  possible  relief.
The IFP supports the Bill. Thank you.

Mr S PILLAY: Chairperson, South Africa is in a state of transition,  and  we
all know that. However, some conveniently choose to ignore that  fact.  Such
people further try to resist all forms of change,  and  that  resistance  is
based on their own  inherent  and  selfish  prejudice  and  usual  financial
interests. It's a common occurrence to find that  those  who  resist  change
cloak their selfish interests in some sort of guise and  appoint  themselves
as God's representatives here on earth.  We  clearly  saw  that  during  the
apartheid era.

We have here before the House a Bill  that  also  seeks  to  bring  about  a
fundamental change in the lives  of  certain  people.  Could  there  be  any
moral, ethical or  spiritual  reasons  for  not  supporting  this  Bill?  We
believe that it is an individual matter and  those  who  seek  to  use  this
piece of legislation should be able to exercise their constitutional  rights
and do so without being dictated to by any other person or organisation.

This Bill seeks to amend the Births and Deaths  Registration  Act  of  1992.
Its intention is quite clearly that  those  persons  who  choose  to  change
their gender are allowed to do so in terms of the provisions in  this  Bill.
During the public hearings we heard from various  people  about  the  impact
the absence of the provisions in this Bill had on their lives. We  therefore
believe it is indeed a timely Bill and it is designed  to  address  specific
issues that exist. However, some submissions indicated that  the  provisions
in the Bill were totally inadequate in many respects.

We hope and trust that the Department of Home Affairs will  implement  these
provisions to make and create a better life for all those who are  affected.
We need to bear in mind that the process that leads to  one  changing  one's
gender is very emotional.

We also urge the Department of Home Affairs and any  other  state  authority
which might be involved in implementing  this  legislation  to  do  so  with
proper regard to  the  sensitivities  involved,  for  example  privacy  when
dealing with an applicant and the confidentiality of the whole process.  The
Bill is  very  specific  on  that  score  wherein  it  stipulates  that  the
applicant shall appear before the magistrate in  chambers,  at  a  time  and
date specified by the magistrate. The  fact  that  the  director-general  is
also obliged to provide written reasons for any refusal  of  an  application
is essential, as it provides a much-needed safeguard  against  prejudice  of
any kind.

Some people who are intersexed reported that this Bill does not in  any  way
meet with their specific needs. That is a matter that needs to be  addressed
to provide clarity on the description and status of such persons.
We need to remember that anyone who embarks on this  process  is  confronted
with issues and prejudices that might be totally unbelievable. Therefore  we
conclude that no person would embark on this  process  lightly  and  without
properly applying their minds as to what lies ahead  of  them.  The  New  NP
will therefore support this Bill.

Mr S N SWART: Chairman and hon members, the  ACDP,  together  with  the  NA,
will oppose this legislation, notwithstanding constitutional imperatives  or
the Law Commission's report.

Whilst we appreciate that the present  South  African  law  allows  for  sex
change surgery, we believe that the approach adopted by  the  English  cases
and used in South African courts should be followed.  The  central  question
in these cases was whether it was possible for a person to change their  sex
as defined for the purposes of marriage.

In deciding that it was not, the South African court applied  the  so-called
Ormond Test from the English case of Corbett vs Corbett. This  test  applied
a biological and genetic definition of sex. It considered  the  chromosomal,
gonadal and genital tests, and if all three of these  were  congruent,  this
would determine the person's sex for the  purposes  of  marriage.  In  other
words, a person's sex for legal purposes in terms  of  these  decisions  was
found to be a wholly  biological  question  and  is  fixed  at  birth.  This
accordingly does not change by adding or lopping off body parts.

This approach affirms our viewpoint that we are  fearfully  and  wonderfully
created by a loving God, and that surgical or medical intervention does  not
change our sex.

We also have an objection  to  the  inclusion  of  the  phrase  ``evolvement
through natural development resulting in  a  sex  change''.  We  reject  the
unscientific basis of Darwinism and the evolution theory, and  fail  to  see
the need for the inclusion of this phrase when no evidence  exists  of  such
occurrences in South Africa. This  is  another  example  of  the  impact  of
secular humanism  on  our  legislative  process  -  secular  humanism  being
undergirded by concepts of atheism and evolution.

The ACDP will accordingly not support this Bill.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker.  The  MF  strongly  supports  the
human rights stipulated in our Bill of Rights in our  national  Constitution
of 1996. It is felt that provision is made for individual  rights  over  all
parts of ourselves.

In view of the alteration of sex description and sex status,  the  MF  feels
that if alteration is made to your sex it is  important  that  Home  Affairs
notes this once your sex has been altered. There is no sense in being  noted
as something you are not.
In light  of  this  the  MF  finds  this  Bill  appropriate  and  necessary.
Furthermore, the alteration of one's sex should be an  individual  decision.
The MF supports the Alteration of  Sex  Description  and  Sex  Status  Bill.
Thank you.

Mr W M SKHOSANA: Madam Speaker, members, Minister, lives had to be lived  at
the beginning of things. It is life at an  early  stage  and  it  should  be
developed because it is natural. When it ends it should end  because  it  is
natural.

At this point in time, as people of South Africa, we need  to  see  life  as
life and we need to see ourselves as human beings, not as males or  females.
The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa says it all.  Circumstances
surrounding the alteration, sex description and sex status affect us all.

We should acknowledge that the research on this  subject  is  sporadic.  For
many reasons, some partially homophobic, the only proper  co-ordination  and
extensive research was done in the process of compiling the  diagnostic  and
statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association. The reasons  for
that are obvious.

During fetal development, after conception, the central  nervous  system  is
the  first  to   develop.   During   this   stage   the   concentration   of
gonadotrophins, which are hormones which  determine  whether  the  fetus  is
going to be male or female, are very crucial. As a  result,  the  developing
stage is a very important stage in human nature. It is possible  to  have  a
developing central nervous system subjected to an appreciable  concentration
of testosterone which is found  in  male  organs  or  oestrogens  which  are
female. The shifting of this concentration during  sex  differentiation  can
cause a misunderstanding as to whether you are on the left or right.

An appreciable concentration of testosterone will be responsible for a  male
fetus  and  that  of  oestrogen  will  result  in  a  female   fetus.   Most
importantly, hormones are very  independent  regarding  their  concentration
during the development of the central nervous system.

The result of this sexual miscalculation is a minority in our society  which
is equally entitled to enjoy the legal protection of our  democracy.  We  do
not claim to have all the medical facts on  the  subject,  nor  do  we  have
scientific research at all. All we are saying is that  we  are  moving  from
the premise that our Constitution, in Chapter 2, protects them.

South Africa remained apart from the winds of change that swept most of  the
continent in the early  60s.  Protected  by  the  ring  of  colonial  buffer
states, Pretoria concentrated  its  regional  policy  and  strengthened  its
economic and military ties with these states. That time ended  in  1994,  on
27 April, when all of us were regarded as human beings, black and white.

At this point in time I don't think that we should see ourselves  as  either
on the left or right. This is very important because whatever  happens  does
not only work in the mind of an individual, it works in  the  minds  of  the
particular parents of that child. It works in the minds of  the  friends  of
that particular child. It also works in an individual in society.

It is also important for us to ensure, as we work in society, that  we  take
note of the views and feelings of the minority. We  can  only  understand  a
written statement or spoken statement because we know what is going  on.  If
we  do  not  understand  or  know  what  is  going  on,  we  are  likely  to
systematically misunderstand. This is the basis on  which  most  comics  and
films operate. Someone may say some of the things  while  not  understanding
what is actually happening beyond their minds.

It is important at this point in time, as a new democracy,  that  we  should
see ourselves as people of this country who have all  the  rights  regarding
whatever our minds and feelings  want  us  to  do  in  accordance  with  the
Constitution of the country. We should also  try  to  align  ourselves  with
those feelings of the minority.

It is very unfortunate  that  the  only  parties  that  do  not  attend  the
portfolio committee meetings of Home Affairs are the ones  who  are  opposed
to  this  Bill  today.  They  only  oppose  this  Bill  because  they  don't
understand or know, and they did not hear what it is that those  people  who
presented in the public hearings had to say.

I think it is also important at this point  in  time  to  note  that,  as  a
society, we don't know exactly what is going to happen to  us  tomorrow.  As
we are seated here, men and women, all of us, we do have other hormones.  As
I stand here, I do have hormones of a female but what is most  important  to
me is that I have more male hormones. As a result,  my  characteristics  are
determined by most of the hormones that are in me. If you are a  woman,  you
do have male hormones but what is important  is  that  your  characteristics
and development result from the majority of hormones  that  you  have  as  a
female. They are the ones which determine under which sex category you  will
fall.

We should not fool ourselves and say we are what we are  because  we  wanted
to become what we are. On that note, I thank you very much. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Hon Madam Speaker and  hon  members,  I  would
like to thank all hon members who have participated in this debate.

I would like to just correct Madam Van Wyk's swipe  at  my  department  when
she talked about failure. I don't know what failure she was  talking  about.
I would like to say to her, with due respect, that  I  am  the  Minister  of
President T M Mbeki - who is the president of the ANC. He should see  me  as
such. It is true, of course, that our parties have their own  identity,  but
he can be sure that I have joint and several responsibilities  as  a  member
of Cabinet.

Also, my department cannot be blamed in this case because the facts  of  the
matter are that this Bill comes from the  SA  Law  Commission.  It  actually
caters for a specific class of people. The department could not,  therefore,
change it as it willed, because it came from the commission and  we  had  to
implement it, as I said in my remarks, in line with the Constitution.

The submissions from certain individuals apparently seemed to  confuse  some
members who wanted to have the Bill changed  beyond  recognition  from  that
which was approved by Cabinet in the first place. Obviously,  this  was  not
possible. If there is a need for another piece of legislation,  this  should
be investigated and drafted  later.  This  is  what  legislative  and  legal
procedures, in fact, require one to do. One doesn't  just  chop  and  change
draft legislation as one gets requests from  certain  individuals  who  want
such requests to be included in the Bill while that was  not  the  intention
of the Bill in the first place.

I thank the hon member,  Mr  Skhosana,  for  explaining  that  some  of  our
colleagues who have expressed very strong reservations about  the  Bill  are
people who, in fact, don't  attend  portfolio  committee  meetings  of  Home
Affairs, because all the chopping  and  changing  of  legislation  from  the
executive takes place in the portfolio committees. It's really not  the  way
to try to do it here when the matter is before  the  legislature  while  one
had all the opportunity to do so when the matter was  before  the  portfolio
committee. The basic concept or  essence  of  any  legislation  may  not  be
changed at the whim of any  person,  without  having  to  take  it  back  to
Cabinet.

With those few words, I would like to thank  my  hon  colleagues  for  their
comments and for their support of the Bill. Thanks very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (African Christian  Democratic  Party  and  National
Action dissenting).

               FINANCIAL AND FISCAL COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL

     (Consideration of Bill as amended by National Council of Provinces)

There was no debate.

Bill agreed to.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, before I adjourn the House, I wish you  well.  You
have arduous weeks ahead of you with a brief respite when  you  return  here
in the middle of October. But I would urge you not  only  to  consider  your
party's supporters or potential voters, but to  consider  the  good  of  our
society; which means we need a very large number of registrations.

So, please,  let  us  do  our  democratic  duty  as  well  as  our  parties'
responsibilities  and  make  sure  that  we  register   every   unregistered
potential voter. Since all  of  you  know  that  you  are  going  to  get  a
majority, or at least you assure me that you are going to, this is  also  in
your interests.

Thank you all, very much. Have a good recess.

The MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS:  Madam  Speaker,  can  you  allow  me  to  say
``Amen''! to what you have just said. [Laughter.]

The SPEAKER: That is fully in order, Minister.

The House adjourned at 12:59.
