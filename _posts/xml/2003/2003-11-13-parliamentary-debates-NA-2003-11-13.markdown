                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY:  Deputy  Speaker,  I  move  the

Majority Party as follows:

Agreed to.

               RACIST ATTACK ON BLACK CHILD AT GOODWOOD SCHOOL

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms V MERUTI (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the ANC,  I  bring  to
the attention of this House the racist attack on a black child  at  Edgemead
High School in Goodwood. The mother, daughter and the  daughter's  boyfriend
assaulted an African female student. Uttering racist  remarks,  they  pulled
her hair and excreted on her in full view of fellow pupils.

It is the most disgusting, barbaric act of  our  times.  This  is  indeed  a
violation of human rights. Black and white students have a right  to  attend
the school of their choice.

Edgemead High School is one of the most racist schools  in  Cape  Town,  and
the principal is in cahoots in all these racist incidents.  No  support  has
been given to the student by the  school  after  the  incident,  but  fellow
students supported her. She even had to go on her own to report  the  matter
to the police.

We welcome the investigation by the education MEC, Andre Gaum, and  we  call
upon the Minister of Education, Prof K Asmal, to intervene.

The ANC calls upon all peace-loving South Africans to unite against  racism.
We thank all those who have expressed their support to the  victim  and  her
family. I thank you. [Applause.]

                       FF MEMBERS CROSSING OVER TO DA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr J L THERON (DA): Mevrou  die  Adjunkspeaker,  dit  is  vandag  die  ``VF
Minus'' en nie die VF Plus nie. Dit is jammer hulle is nie vandag hier  nie,
want ek sou hulle graag dit wou  laat  hoor.  Die  VF  Plus  is  nou  minus.
[Tussenwerpsels.] Hulle leier, die adjunkleier, die jeugleier  en  baie  van
die lede in hulle takke in Limpopo het oorgestap na die DA  toe.  Hulle  wil
nie meer regs beweeg na die Konserwatiewe Party  toe  nie,  maar  hulle  wil
saam met die koalisie vir verandering,  die  DA,  die  IVP  en  andere,  die
magsgreep van die ANC verbreek. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Die  leier,  dr  Gerrit  Venter,  die  adjunkleier,  Anton  Weyers,  en  die
jeugleier, Deon Jewaskiewitz, het vandag  oorgestap  na  die  DA  toe.  Soos
voorspel, gaan die binnegevegte tussen die VF  en  die  Konserwatiewe  Party
nog baie interessante bokspronge veroorsaak. [Tussenwerpsels.] Dit raak  dus
al hoe duideliker dat die VF nie 'n opsie vir Afrikaners is nie.  Afrikaners
wil liewer binne die koalisie vir verandering bou aan 'n  beter  Suid-Afrika
vir al sy mense. Ek dank  u.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mr J L THERON (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, today it is the ``FF Minus''  and
not the FF Plus. It is a pity that they are not here today, because I  would
have liked to have told them so. The FF Plus is now minus.  [Interjections.]
Their leader, the deputy leader, the youth leader and a lot of members  from
their branches in Limpopo have crossed over to the DA. They no  longer  wish
to move towards the right, to the Conservative Party, but together with  the
coalition for change, the DA, the IFP and others, they  want  to  break  the
stranglehold of the ANC. [Interjections.]

Their leader, Dr Gerrit Venter, deputy leader Anton Weyers and youth  leader
Deon Jewaskiewitz have crossed over to  the  DA  today.  As  predicted,  the
infighting between the FF and the  Conservative  Party  is  still  going  to
cause  a  lot  of  interesting  antics.  [Interjections.]  It  is  therefore
becoming more and more obvious that the FF is not an option for  Afrikaners.
Afrikaners would rather build towards a better  South  Africa  for  all  its
people from within the coalition for change. I thank you. [Interjections.]]

                             DEATH OF POLICEMEN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): The number of police officers being killed  in  South
Africa just keeps on growing daily. In  the  latest  incident,  an  off-duty
police detective was shot and killed in Khayelitsha in the Western Cape,  on
Tuesday 11 November. The detective was attending a memorial  church  service
when he received a phone call and went  outside,  where  he  was  apparently
confronted by unknown men who fired shots at him.

We offer our sincerest condolences to the family of the  deceased  and  urge
any members of the community  with  information  to  assist  the  police  in
apprehending the killers who  committed  this  murder.  There  should  be  a
closer working relationship between the SAPS and members of the  communities
around the country if we are to win the war against crime.

This tragic and  senseless  killing  brings  to  11  the  number  of  police
officers killed in the Western Cape alone this year. The  number  of  police
officers being killed or shot at around the country is much too  high.  This
is a totally  unacceptable  situation  that  seems  to  be  getting  out  of
control. We have to find a way to put a stop to  these  senseless  killings.
We cannot allow the  criminals  to  get  the  upper  hand  and  kill  police
officers at will.

                       EXPANDED PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAMME

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N MAHLAWE (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, the  ANC  wishes  to  express  its
sense of great pleasure at the news that Government is  about  to  implement
the Expanded Public Works Programme. The urgency with  which  this  task  is
being undertaken is  a  clear  demonstration  of  the  ANC-led  Government's
commitment to pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

This nationwide programme will contribute positively to the  lives  of  many
of our people. It will draw  significant  numbers  of  the  unemployed  into
productive work where they will gain skills while being  gainfully  employed
and improve their capacity to earn an income once they leave the  programme.
In that way, the programme will also reduce the numbers  of  those  who  are
dependent on social grants for their livelihood by creating the  opportunity
for them to engage in productive and gainful work, thus helping  to  restore
the human dignity of many of our people and giving meaning to our freedom.

The success of this initiative will contribute to both the building and  the
strengthening  of  the  people's  contract  for  a  better   tomorrow.   The
undertaking  and  the  practical  engagement  by  Government  in  this  task
demonstrate that the ANC-led Government is a government that listens to  the
people and persistently works to defeat  poverty.  It  further  demonstrates
the  ANC-led  Government's  commitment  to  working  with  the  people   and
encouraging their involvement in the struggle to change their lives for  the
better. I thank you.

                        ELECTORAL LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the New  NP  welcomes
the announcement by the hon President that the  Government  is  prepared  to
make concessions and amend the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill to allow  South
Africans abroad to vote. When the Bill was debated in  Parliament,  the  New
NP submitted a formal amendment to the  Bill,  specifically  proposing  that
South Africans abroad should be allowed to vote.

This, once again,  proves  that  the  DA  style  of  destructive  opposition
politics is meaningless, while the  New  NP  style  of  constructive  debate
shows results and ensures that the voters' concerns are  addressed.  The  DA
is supposedly the Official Opposition, but  its  input  amounts  to  nothing
more than  shouting  and  criticising.  What  have  they  achieved  so  far?
Nothing. [Interjections.] The New NP and  even  other  smaller  parties  are
overshadowing the DA when it comes to putting real arguments  on  the  table
and getting things done.

The DA has also once again shown their true colours when,  in  two  separate
incidents, two DA councillors allegedly referred to  the  President  and  to
blacks as ``kaffirs''.  The  DA  has  stated  that  they  have  launched  an
internal investigation and will act harshly against  members  who  use  that
word, but we all know what that means - a gentle rap  on  the  knuckles,  or
denial.

It  is  laughable  that  while  the  DA  is  always  the  first  to   demand
resignations, commissions of inquiry and  apologies,  and  calls  for  swift
action  when  it  concerns  other  parties,  they  have  a  holier-than-thou
attitude and turn a blind eye when it concerns their own  members.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

                 DEFENCE FORCE BUDGET BELOW ACCEPTABLE NORMS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A BLAAS (ACDP): Deputy  Speaker,  in  terms  of  the  Medium-Term  Budget
Policy Statement the Minister of Finance has forced the  Defence  budget  to
below  acceptable  norms.  This  will  severely   compromise   the   defence
capability of the SA National Defence Force.

An accepted norm for defence budgets for countries similar to  South  Africa
is set at 1,8 to 2% of GDP. At present, the RSA Defence budget sits at  1,6%
of the GDP, and is reduced to 1,3% for the year 2006-07.

This will further reduce the  capability  to  service  or  replace  existing
obsolete  equipment  in  general  and,  more   specifically,   the   defence
capabilities of landward  defences.  The  Casspirs  used  for  transport  in
Burundi are an excellent example. Service levels are dangerously  low.  They
are no longer manufactured, and spares are  not  available.  There  are  not
enough to support existing needs. The remaining Casspirs  are  all  we  have
and are not suitable for deployment in areas with heavy rainfall, as is  the
case in Burundi. No financial resources are available to do something  about
this.

We should make the choice to either provide the necessary  funds,  over  and
above the direct costs for special missions, or recognise our Defence  Force
budget limitations and not promise aid where we cannot afford to  render  it
effectively, otherwise the Defence Force and South Africa's credibility  and
safety are placed at risk. We need a Defence Force that can do us proud  and
maintain our capabilities.

    CONGRATULATIONS TO PROGRESSIVE YOUTH ALLIANCE ON WINNING TURFLOOP SRC
                                  ELECTIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M J MALAHLELA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, as  a  convocator  of  the  SA
Students' Congress I take this opportunity to congratulate  the  Progressive
Youth Alliance, constituted by the SA  Students'  Congress,  the  ANC  Youth
League, the Students' Union for Christian Action, the YCS  and  the  Student
Christian Organisation, on winning the 2003-04  SRC  elections  held  on  23
October 2003 at the University of the North, Turfloop.

We further congratulate this alliance of the  progressive  youth  on  having
ensured that multitudes of students, the majority of whom are from  working-
class backgrounds, register as voters for the forthcoming general  elections
in 2004.

The ANC calls upon all students to continue fighting for the  transformation
of  our  education  in   general,   and   in   particular   for   curriculum
transformation with a special focus on its content  and  design.  This  will
ensure that the multitudes of our students  are  enrolled  in  courses  that
will help them respond to the dictates of the labour market upon  completion
of their studies.

We call upon these finest cadres  of  our  society,  black  in  general  and
African in particular, to apply in their numbers  to  the  National  Student
Financial Aid Scheme because financial exclusion is  a  dialect  foreign  to
the ANC. We call upon all of the progressive youth  to  continue  mobilising
the young behind the vision of the ANC and,  vice  versa,  for  the  ANC  to
mobilise behind the vision of the youth. Hola 7!

                  ZIMBABWE CRISIS IGNORED BY ANC GOVERNMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J P I BLANCHÉ (FA): Madam  Speaker,  the  ANC  Government  has  abandoned
ordinary Zimbabweans. Opposition members are attacked and arrested, rape  is
used as a government weapon, opposition farmers and  farmworkers  have  been
forced off the farms, and the land given to Zanu-PF  loyalists.  Now  people
are starving  while  Zanu-PF  loyalists  and  leaders  shop  in  Europe  and
Johannesburg.

Inflation is out of  control,  but  Mugabe  is  building  himself  a  luxury
mansion. Even our Industrial Development  Corporation  is  advising  against
investment in Zimbabwe, and still the ANC is silent.

The attacks on the independent Daily News have  also  been  ignored  by  the
ANC. This is why we would like to commend the This  Day  newspaper  for  its
effort to bring back an independent voice. Today it dropped  off  copies  of
the newspaper in Zimbabwe containing articles  written  by  the  Daily  News
reporters.

The DA echoes the call by This Day for the ANC to end its  shameful  silence
on the tragedy currently unfolding in Zimbabwe. Thank you.

             HEFER COMMISSION TURNING INTO THEATRE OF THE ABSURD

                            (Member’s Statement)

Mnr C AUCAMP (NA): Agb Adjunkspeaker, die Hefer-kommissie van  ondersoek  is
besig om te ontaard in 'n teater van die absurde. In antwoord op  die  vraag
oor waarom hy uitgesluit word uit die opdrag van die Hefer-kommissie  en  sy
verlede oënskynlik nie meer ter sake is nie, het die Minister  van  Justisie
Penuell Maduna gesê dit dien geen doel om in dié stadium op die  kwessie  te
fokus nie, omdat belangriker sake aan die bod is.

Die NA wil met die Minister saamstem, maar die vraag  is:  waarom  dien  dit
dan 'n doel om Openbare Vervolger Bulelani Ngcuka se verlede  te  ondersoek?
Of Ngcuka 'n spioen was of nie is vir die uitvoer  van  sy  verantwoordelike
pligte nie ter sprake nie. Indien dit so sou wees, is die NA  se  kommentaar
eenvoudig: ``So what?''

In dié verband is die kommentaar van oudregter Kriegler  van  betekenis.  Hy
wys op 5 November daarop dat kommissies van ondersoek maklik 'n matjie  word
waaronder regerings  omstrede  kwessies  doodvee,  en  hy  bevraagteken  die
wysheid van geregtelike ondersoeke na politieke  debatte.  Dis  klaarblyklik
net vir die ANC van belang of Ngcuka 'n apartheidspioen was of nie.

In dié verband verneem die NA graag by die Minister of die ANC  die  onkoste
van die Hefer-ondersoek gaan dra.  Ek  dank  u.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member's statement follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP (NA): Hon Deputy Speaker, the Hefer commission  of  inquiry  is
degenerating into a theatre of the absurd. In reply to the  question  as  to
why he is being excluded from the brief of the Hefer commission and why  his
past is apparently not relevant any more, the Minister  of  Justice  Penuell
Maduna said that it served no purpose to focus on the matter at this  stage,
because there are more important matters.

The NA wants to agree with the Minister, but the question is: Why then  does
it serve a purpose to investigate Public Prosecutor Bulelani Ngcuka's  past?
Whether or not Ngcuka was a spy is not  relevant  to  the  exercise  of  his
responsibilities and duties. If that were so, the NA's  comment  is  simply:
``So what?''

In this regard the comment of former judge Kriegler is of importance.  On  5
November he pointed out that commissions of inquiry easily become  a  carpet
under which governments sweep contentious matters,  and  he  questioned  the
wisdom of judicial inquiries into political debates. It  is  obviously  only
important to the ANC whether or not Ngcuka was an apartheid spy.

In this regard the NA would like to ask the  Minister  whether  the  ANC  is
going to bear the cost of the Hefer inquiry. I thank you.]

            WELCOMING OF STATE VISIT TO INDIA BY PRESIDENT MBEKI

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L T LANDERS (ANC): Deputy Speaker,  the  House  notes  and  welcomes  the
state visit paid to India by President Thabo Mbeki, accompanied by  a  large
delegation of Ministers, advisers and businesspeople during the week  of  13
October 2003.

This state visit cements  the  strong  ties  of  friendship  and  solidarity
forged over 100 years between the peoples of South Africa and  India.  These
bonds,  sealed  in  the  struggles  of  our  two  peoples  for  freedom  and
democracy, are best symbolised in the life and work  of  Mohandas  K  Gandhi
who came to South Africa as a young barrister and  left  our  country  as  a
committed freedom fighter who went  on  to  become  the  father  of  India's
independence.

President Mbeki's state visit to India  comes  at  a  time  when  developing
countries of the South  are  facing  new  challenges  in  the  international
arena,  especially  with  regard  to  the  inequitable  international  trade
regime,  the  threat   of   international   terrorism,   and   the   growing
unilateralism of the most powerful states of the North.

India and South Africa have become important trading  partners  since  1994,
and co-operation between the South African and Indian  business  communities
has increased markedly during the same period. Co-operation in the field  of
primary health care, education, science, technology  and  culture  was  also
enhanced by the signing of a number of  agreements  between  our  respective
governments, and  these  should  help  immeasurably  as  we  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]

                      HOUSING DELIVERY IN SA IN CRISIS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms J A SEMPLE (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, housing delivery in  South  Africa
is in crisis. The ANC claims, in its 10-year review, that  it  has  approved
over a million housing subsidies, but it fails to own  up  as  to  how  many
structurally sound houses it has actually delivered.

Government housing projects are rotten with corruption.  And,  why  are  ANC
councillors getting RDP houses ahead of those who are  really  in  need?  On
top of that, housing delivery appears to be grinding to a  halt.  So  little
is happening that even the portfolio committee has  only  met  once  in  the
past three months, with no more meetings scheduled for this year.

In the Western Cape, the ANC housing Minister admits that her department  is
in a shambles, which she blames on her New NP predecessor.  When  asked  why
she failed to spend 80%, or R337 million, of her budget, she throws  up  her
hands in despair and blames developers. While the ANC elite takes refuge  in
the leafy suburbs, the number of homeless South Africans continues to  rise.
[Interjections.]

    NEWSPAPERS REPORT CASES OF DA REPRESENTATIVES UTTERING RACIST REMARKS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M RAMGOBIN (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, newspapers  report  cases  of  DA
members and the DA's public representatives uttering  remarks  referring  to
people as ``faffirs''. It is to be condemned that the DA  in  this  day  and
age accepts and promotes people who behave  in  this  way.  We  are  now  in
election mode and  this  sort  of  behaviour  can  only  lead  to  dangerous
situations.

I would strongly recommend that the DA follow the example  of  the  ANC  and
fight racism wherever it is found. The  DA  must  sift  its  representatives
more carefully and weed out the racists.

No political party in South Africa should tolerate such views in  its  ranks
any longer. We need to ask the DA why it continues to attract  and  publicly
field people with such racist ideas. Thank you. [Applause.]

                             SAFETY ON OUR ROADS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, with  the  series  of  accidents
over the  past  few  weeks  involving  trucks,  Government  must  prioritise
finding  alternative  transportation   methods   for   heavy-duty   hauling,
especially  with  the  festive  season  approaching.  Although   there   are
responsible carriers who abide by good practices, and  ensure  road  safety,
there are a few rotten apples that cause havoc on our roads,  turning  these
trucks into weapons of mass destruction on wheels.

Overloading, driver fatigue, unroadworthy trucks, and  drunken  driving  are
only some of the causes of these accidents, which means that most  of  these
fatal accidents could have been avoided. Higher standards of safety must  be
developed and enforced by vehicle testing stations.

The traffic department must include overloading spot checks  in  the  Arrive
Alive campaign to ensure that trucks comply with the required  loads.  After
an accident or a licence suspension, drivers must be retrained and  retested
before they are allowed back on our roads.  Regulations  must  be  developed
which stipulate  that  all  heavy-duty  transporters  should  be  painted  a
reflective colour to ensure visibility at night and in fog.

Overloading does not only cause  considerable  damage  to  roads,  but  also
contributes to serious  road  safety  problems.  Therefore  Government  must
consider upgrading and expanding the services provided by  Spoornet.  Heavy-
duty and hazardous cargo should be transported by rail.

The New NP would like to pledge its support to  the  Arrive  Alive  campaign
and hope that this coming festive season will not  be  overshadowed  by  the
death toll on our roads.

                        PARENTAL CORPORAL PUNISHMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S N SWART (ACDP): Madam Deputy Speaker, while the number of  child  abuse
cases reported daily in South Africa is appalling,  the  criminalisation  of
moderate parental corporal punishment is not the answer. It  is  significant
that the criminalisation of corporal punishment at schools  has  not  solved
the problem of physical abuse,  with  Childline  reportedly  receiving  more
reports of assaults than ever before. This, we believe, would  be  the  same
situation in the  home  should  moderate  corporal  parental  punishment  be
abolished.

Whilst there are alternatives to enforcing  discipline  within  the  family,
there may be times when spanking, as a moderate  form  of  chastisement,  is
necessary. Incidents of abusive discipline do occur, however, and when  they
do, guilty parents must be prosecuted to the full  extent  of  the  law  for
assault and child abuse.

In line with the ACDP's Biblical world view, ``Spare the rod and  spoil  the
child'' the  ACDP  is  opposed  to  provisions  in  the  South  African  Law
Commission's draft Children's Bill  that  seek  to  remove  the  common  law
defence  of  reasonable  chastisement  available  to  parents,   effectively
criminalising all forms of parental corporal punishment.

Our concerns have been confirmed by Minister Pahad's recent statements  that
a parent does not have the right  to  spank  a  child,  notwithstanding  the
removal of this particular clause in the final draft.

Child abuse in any form must  be  met  with  the  full  force  of  the  law;
however, there is no doubt about  the  important  role  that  the  God-given
right of moderate chastisement  of  children  can  play  within  the  family
context.

We are also concerned that limited state resources will  be  used  to  track
down and prosecute parents who moderately chastise  their  children,  rather
than convict murderers, hijackers, rapists and those  that  abuse  children.
[Applause.]

               SUCCESSFUL VOTER REGISTRATION IN THE FREE STATE

                            (Member's Statement)

[Mr L J MODISENYANE (ANC): Open your ears and listen. Chairperson, the  Free
State has once again surprised the opposition with the number of new  voters
who registered on 8 and 9 November of this year. The number  of  new  voters
who registered during the registration week  was  17  000.  This  shows  how
surprising the 2004 elections will be. I repeat, there is only one  bull  in
the Free State, and the ANC will win the elections.]

    RACISM IN SCHOOLS, ELECTIONS AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT, AND CORPORAL
                                 PUNISHMENT

                           (Minister's Responses)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, there are three  bases  for
intervention.  One  was  from  Comrade  Meruti,  the  other   from   Comrade
Malahlela, and one from the  ACDP.  Could  I  say  in  relation  to  Comrade
Meruti, concerning the appalling attack on a young girl at Edgemead, that  I
have in fact written to  the  principal.  I  have  drawn  attention  to  two
aspects.

First of all, there must  be  strong  opposition,  as  part  of  the  school
policy, against any form of racism and gender discrimination. Secondly,  the
young girl should have been given  immediate  assistance.  She  should  have
been cherished, provided with assistance, and if she wanted  to  go  to  the
police station, she ought not have  gone  alone.  She  ought  to  have  been
accompanied by a teacher. The third point is that  there  should  have  been
immediate suspension - because this was very visible - of  the  attacker  of
this girl.

May I say that Edgemead has fewer than 30% black children. I think  that  we
have to be a little bit careful to describe  Edgemead  as  the  most  racist
school in Cape Town. I think that we have to be very careful in  this  area,
because we are dealing with young people. The Western Cape will have a  full
investigation. I have asked for a comprehensive reply. We are not  going  to
be satisfied with any covering up on this.
I ask members of the House to remember that issues of racism in schools  are
something we are tackling very carefully under the values in  education.  Of
course it is very important to remember  that  after  50  years  of  racism,
which is very much part of the fabric  of  our  society,  there  must  be  a
conscious and deliberate attempt to tackle it.

I ask members of the opposition, in particular, not to criticise the  others
present who say that racism is a matter that is virtually endemic  in  parts
of our society. It is unusual to say that it is not there, because 10  years
after freedom you cannot expect the indoctrination  -  which  permeated  all
aspects of society - to have been removed.

I join Comrade Meruti  in  condemning  this,  and  I  call  upon  all  South
Africans to support the motion that says we must in fact extend our  support
and sympathy to those who are victims  of  racial  discrimination.  I  would
ask, on the other  hand,  that  we  should  ensure  that  we  use  temperate
language and take great care when we deal with issues of  this  type.  Thank
you very much on that.
As far as Comrade Malahlela is concerned, there are three issues  that  come
up here. Firstly, the elections at the University of  the  North  were  held
peacefully. Secondly, they were guaranteed to have been fair  and  free  and
attested by independent election monitors - which is  very  important.  What
happens at other higher education institutions is that when elections  come,
suddenly extreme proposals are made which the  university  is  not  able  to
meet, and therefore there is tension and  sometimes  more  than  tension.  I
congratulate  the  University  of  the  North  for  having  this  degree  of
stability.

The third point is the issue of student curriculums and what  they  face  at
universities.  Obviously  universities  must  look  very  carefully  at  the
relevance of their curriculum. Relevance of the curriculum, as Mr  Malahlela
says, responds to the dictates of the labour market.  But  universities  are
more than labour market recruiters. The labour market  every  now  and  then
changes its mind about what kind of  recruits  it  wants.  That  is  why  we
should follow the  Government's  human  resource  development  policy  which
indicates in which areas there are very urgent needs.

After all, there  are  third-level  institutions  that  are  training  large
numbers of people in business administration where there are no  jobs.  They
do it largely because we pay their subsidy by head count.  We  are  changing
that now, as subsidies will be paid partly  on  head  count  and  partly  on
results in order to improve the throughput rate - and the  results  will  be
very important.

We are certainly aware of the fact that curriculum development has  to  take
place in higher education. I was aware of that, for example, when I was  the
Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry: Our engineers were taught  to  build
large dams, and large dams were not what was going  to  be  built.  What  we
really wanted were people who knew how to build  community  water  projects.
We could not get higher education to respond to that immediately.

Finally, on the national financial aid scheme, as the  Minister  of  Finance
said yesterday, this has been one the  great  success  stories  in  redress.
This year we'll spend nearly a billion rand on providing assistance to  very
poor Africans, very poor coloureds, very poor  Indians  and  whites  too.  I
have particularly directed the National  Student  Financial  Aid  Scheme  to
look at the position of coloureds, because coloured participation in  higher
education is as low as it is for Africans - 14%.  Schools  must  go  out  of
their  way  to  understand  the  National  Student  Financial  Aid   Scheme,
especially among very poor Afrikaners. That is a  Government  decision  that
would address the needs of poor Afrikaners too.

Let me say one thing, though: There is no free ride  in  this.  If  students
fail  their  examinations,  the  grant  from  the  NSFAS  will  discontinue.
However, the important thing I want to remind the House  of  is  that  those
who get NSFAS grants - and nearly a  quarter  of  a  million  students  have
received them since 1994 - do better than those who are privately funded  by
their own families. So this is a great success story for  public  power  and
public good. I am very pleased to say that those who are  financially  aided
by the state - remember this is a subsidy; some of it can be converted  into
a grant if they do well - do much better than those who are funded by  their
families. You should clap for that, because I think that is a great  success
story. [Applause.]

The final point is about children. I don't  think  we  should  build  houses
without bricks. The Bible says that the first strike in history  took  place
when the Pharaoh  asked  the  builders  to  build  without  straw,  and  the
builders went on strike because one can't make bricks  without  straw.  Now,
the hon member is making  bricks  without  straw.  It  is  not  Government's
policy to remove the right to reasonable chastisement.  That  was  there  in
the original draft. When the Bill came up a number  of  Ministers  discussed
this, and we felt that it would be inappropriate at  this  time.  Also,  the
context is always important.

What we did say was that  reasonable  chastisement  very  often  borders  on
abuse. A good family, good parents ... I grew up in a  family  of  nine;  we
were poor after the war. None of us was ever struck by our parents,  and  we
were very difficult - we were eight boys.  None  of  us  was  chastised.  So
remember that. Of course, there are people  who  say:  ``I  was  hit  by  my
mother, I was hit by my father, I was hit in school. Look  at  me,  at  what
kind of bloke I am.'' Well, that is very suspicious. [Laughter.]

However, can  I  say  therefore  that  we  are  not  criminalising  corporal
punishment. What we are saying is that in terms of the Schools  Act,  upheld
by the Constitutional Court, no student at school - and  teachers  have  the
right to reasonable chastisement - can be corporally  punished.  I  hope  no
member of  this  Parliament  is  going  to  be  ambiguous  about  that.  The
Constitutional  Court  ruled  against  the  very   idea.   This   was   very
interesting, because the  applicant  said  that  boys  could  be  corporally
punished, not girls. They made a  distinction  between  them,  because  they
knew they would lose when it came to the girls. That is why I  think  it  is
important that we remember that the transition from  home  to  school  is  a
very small transition, and that corporal punishment, in principle, is not  a
very good way of bringing up children. Thank you. [Time expired.]

                           MURDER OF POLICE MEMBER

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Madam Speaker, it is  a  pity  that  Mr
Ferreira has left the House. I wanted to commend him on the  observation  he
made about the murder of one of our police members in Khayelitsha,  who  was
a member in good standing in regard to  that  community.  The  deceased  was
very committed to our programme for the safety and security of  our  people.
He was also committed to the ideals of  our  democratic  dispensation  as  a
leading member of Popcru.

I am happy that the hon member raised this matter, which is  a  matter  that
we are investigating very exhaustively. We will leave no stone  unturned  to
ensure that we get those who have committed that dastardly murder.

(Translation of Tswana paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs M S MAINE: Deputy Chairperson, Ministers of state and  colleagues,  the
above-mentioned committee went out to investigate whether the laws  we  have
passed here to deal with conflict, domestic  violence  and  child  care  are
being implemented, and what the departments that are supposed  to  implement
them are doing.

This campaign began in April 2000 and ran right up to  May  2003.  The  main
objective was to ensure  that  the  undertakings  by  countries  during  the
women's gathering to eradicate all forms of abuse against  women,  otherwise
known as the Beijing Platform of Action, are being carried out.

What makes us happy is to see that all  the  departments  that  are  dealing
with these issues have received the necessary information  and  are  working
very hard to implement these laws. It is often said that the police are  not
doing their duty, but what we observed,  more  especially  in  the  Northern
Cape, is that the police are doing more  than  is  expected  of  them.  This
means that they deserve great honour.  Most  of  them  are  good  judges  of
character and are doing an excellent job.

A weak point we came across, which needs urgent attention, is  the  lack  of
social workers and other  employees  at  police  stations,  as  well  as  an
insufficient number of cells, a lack of victims' rooms, the careless  manner
in which some doctors fill in  forms,  the  regional  doctors  who  are  not
always present, and the  bribery  of  certain  public  servants  and  police
personnel. Some policemen and policewomen  are  reluctant  to  arrest  their
friends, while others accept bribes.

Long forms are tedious, irrespective of what  they  are  for.  As  a  result
clerks spend a lot of time helping people to fill them in.  Sometimes  files
get lost and it then becomes necessary to create new ones. That takes a  lot
of time. The other thing is the issue of the language used on  those  forms.
People have difficulties with some of the languages used.

Our suggestion is to appeal to the relevant departments to train their shop-
floor employees to perform those functions, in order to enable  the  doctors
to  do  their  forensic  investigations.   Furthermore,   the   budgets   of
departments dealing with the  police,  courts,  social  workers  and  health
workers should be increased. Workers in such departments must agree to  work
extended hours. The training of workers must be an ongoing process.

The  law  that  deals  with  abuse  between  husband  and  wife  should   be
strengthened. Wives who have been granted  court  interdicts  against  their
husbands should not abuse them. Husbands  who  are  being  abused  by  their
wives should also apply for the court interdicts. Dealing with  such  cases,
which involves mediating in conflict situations, is  stressful.  That  means
that the police also need to be counselled. We appeal to the  department  to
ensure that that happens speedily.

Some policemen ridicule and despise men who report cases of abuse  by  their
wives. Therefore, when a policeman finds himself being abused by  his  wife,
he is afraid of reporting that lest he is despised by his  colleagues.  That
is why we have a huge number of policemen who kill their families  and  then
commit suicide.
A police station should have a well-trained social worker who will  be  able
to detect this problem even before it has been reported.  There  has  to  be
close co-operation in all the affected departments.]

The survivors of abuse and rape should be accompanied to  hospitals  by  the
police. Crime kits and forms should be  made  available  at  all  hospitals.
Family  courts  specialising  in  domestic   violence   issues   should   be
established in every district. We have seen some shelters  established,  but
funding is needed for the wide range  of  services,  shelters,  counselling,
advice and enormous amounts  of  community  education  which  the  NGOs  are
providing.

A set of policy guidelines needs to be developed around  maintenance,  since
the Department of Social Development frequently has to deal with  the  legal
aspects pertaining to foster care as well. Clear directives should be  given
with regard to warrants and the execution thereof, and also with  regard  to
garnishing orders. Shorter maintenance forms are required and  these  should
be simplified.
It is also important that photographs of maintenance  defaulters  should  be
taken so that they do not claim to be  someone  else.  The  Maintenance  Act
makes provision for this.

All these Acts cannot be completely free if we ignore the  rights  of  women
in totality. The Communal Land Rights Bill that was discussed  earlier  this
week stated that the overarching objective of the  Bill  is  to  grant  land
tenure rights, individually or  communally,  to  approximately  2,4  million
rural households.

The Bill, we were  told,  seeks  to  legally  recognise  and  formalise  the
African traditional system of communal land within  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution.

Women, in particular black  women,  have  been  severely  marginalised  with
regard to access to land. Customary law denied  women  the  capacity  to  be
allocated land in their personal capacity. Their tenure was linked to  their
status in relation to other male members of the family as wives,  daughters,
mothers and sisters.

The formal legal system gave ad hoc legal recognition to  customary  law  by
creating a framework that enabled customary law to remain  undeveloped.  The
Black Administration Act created a  legislative  framework  that  recognised
the customary law of succession.

The courts, in their  efforts  to  interpret  customary  law,  enforced  the
customary law of succession and defined it to  mean  the  eldest  male  heir
inherits. The effect of the combination of all of these factors  means  that
women have had no access to land.

It is  therefore  important  to  note  that  from  the  onset  the  racially
discriminatory laws  and  practices,  as  well  as  the  interpretation  and
implementation of customary law, have  aggravated  the  position  that  many
black women find themselves in.

Clause 14 of the Bill provides that to secure all the rights or to  transfer
communal land the Minister must institute a  land  rights  enquiry.  Amongst
other things, the land rights enquiry must enquire the measures required  to
promote gender equality in the allocation and registration of the new  order
and the exercise of such rights. This section thus envisages  that  part  of
the enquiry will look at the measures required to promote gender  equity  in
the allocation and registration of new order rights.

It is urged that the existence of new order rights  will  thus  depend  upon
the enquiry regarding securing old order rights.  However,  this  points  to
the failure of the legislation to recognise that women will not be  able  to
hold old order rights because of the manner in which the  rights  have  been
allocated.

There is a need for this legislation to provide a process that  enables  the
creation of new order rights to accommodate women.

Ke dira boikuelo fano gore komiti e e neng e tsere  leeto  le,  e  ikana  fa
gore se se buiwang fano ke nnete, mme botlhe ba ba buang fa ba  tla  bua  ka

[I want to appeal to the committee that undertook this trip  to  swear  that
they will speak the truth, and to every one of its members who is  going  to
speak here to only talk about their experiences. [Applause.]]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the JMC on Improvement  of  Quality  of
Life and Status of Women undertook study tours to all the provinces  between
April 2000 and May 2003  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  Domestic
Violence Act and the Maintenance Act,  amongst  other  things.  These  study
tours enabled the JMC to evaluate the effectiveness of the above Acts  which
are regarded by many as extremely progressive, but  the  implementation  and
funding thereof often leaves a lot to be desired.

The study tours involved hearings and interviews with role-players  such  as
magistrates,  prosecutors,  NGOs  and  the  SA   Police   Service   on   the
implementation of the Acts. Workshops were also held to educate women  about
their rights  as  set  out  in  the  two  pieces  of  legislation.  In  this
presentation I will concentrate on the effects of the  Maintenance  Act  and
my colleague, Sheila Camerer, will deal with the Domestic Violence Act.

As mentioned earlier, one of the  biggest  problems  in  implementing  these
Acts is a lack of resources. While the Acts were passed  with  the  best  of
intentions, it has taken some time, in some  cases  a  few  years,  for  the
necessary budget provisions to be made. This  is  well  illustrated  by  the
lack of maintenance investigators and interpreters. At the  time  that  many
of the study tours were conducted, maintenance investigators  had  not  been
appointed, which was a major concern.  This  meant  that  the  complainants,
usually women, had to trace respondents on their own,  or  that  respondents
lied  about  their  financial  situations  without  the  information   being
checked.
A  concern  raised  in  the  study  tour  of  2003  was   that   maintenance
investigators were only employed on a  six-month  contract,  which  prevents
defendants and  defaulters  from  being  traced.  Individuals  who  are  not
formally employed or do not  have  a  permanent  residence  are  often  very
difficult to track down. Interpreters are just as important as many  of  the
forms are only available in English, despite  the  fact  that  most  of  the
applicants do not speak English or are illiterate. The forms  also  need  to
be shorter and less complicated.

It should also be noted that the Department of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development  has  recently  announced  the  appointment  of  16  maintenance
assistants at courts across the country. However, whilst this is a start  in
addressing the problem, it is insufficient to address the problems faced  by
the maintenance court. It  is  therefore  recommended  that  the  department
prioritise the recruitment and  the  permanent  appointment  of  maintenance
investigators as a matter of urgency.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has piloted  family
court projects in certain provinces.  These  courts  deal  with  maintenance
cases, children's  cases  and  domestic  violence  issues.  They  have  been
designed primarily to be accessible  and  sensitive  to  the  needs  of  the
community. They should operate according to simple, appropriate  procedures,
offer counselling and mediation  support  services  and  provide  a  quality
service in a pleasant, user-friendly environment. It  has  been  recommended
that this project be rolled out to all provinces as soon as possible.

A major problem for many complainants is the payment of the sheriffs of  the
court who require money upfront  for  delivering  papers.  The  majority  of
people needing these services are indigent and  cannot  afford  to  pay  for
them. It is recommended that  the  legislation  regulating  the  payment  of
sheriffs' fees be reviewed so that the service  can  be  accessible  to  the
poorest of the poor.

As with many other Acts, all of which affect our people's lives on  a  daily
basis, the Maintenance Act needs to be simplified in order  to  educate  and
raise public awareness.  Parliament  should  develop  booklets  that  inform
people  how  to  access  their  rights.  All  stakeholders  need  additional
resources for  the  Acts  to  be  successfully  implemented.  This  includes
additional human resources at police stations and courts, as well as  office
equipment and supplies in the form of simple things, like  photocopiers  and
paper. It is unacceptable that applicants are turned away because the  court
has exhausted its photocopying budget.

These are just a few of  the  problems  and  recommendations  that  the  JMC
encountered regarding the Maintenance Act and  the  implementation  thereof.
I'm sure that I speak on behalf of all members of the JMC in expressing  our
thanks to all the stakeholders who participated in the  discussions  in  the
provinces.  We  applaud  their  dedication,  often  under   very   difficult
circumstances, and would like them to know that we have taken  their  issues
seriously and will put pressure on other parliamentary committees to  ensure
that our recommendations are implemented. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M M MDLALOSE: Chairperson, hon members, today we stand before this  House
to report on the developments and the challenges of the two  important  Acts
that were passed in this House in 1998. I  say  that  these  Acts  are  very
important because of their impact on the lives of  many  men  and  women  in
this country, some of  whose  survival  depends  on  the  effectiveness  and
implementation of these Acts.

There has been a tremendous increase in the  number  of  cases  of  domestic
violence reported over the past five years, proving  that  the  victims  are
coming out of the closet and that women and children are becoming  aware  of
their rights and the steps they need  to  take  to  rid  themselves  of  the
abuse.

However, much as this Act has brought  about  this  improvement  as  far  as
public awareness is concerned, the sad part is that in reality what  we  see
on a daily basis is that it seems as if the more people are aware  of  their
rights, the more such rights are violated. There isn't  a  single  day  that
goes by without one hearing  about  or  observing  some  form  of  abuse  or
domestic violence in  our  communities.  This  problem  transcends  economic
standing and the well-to-do  because  high-profile  individuals  are  either
victims or perpetrators of domestic violence.

One of the greatest challenges  of  this  Act  is  ensuring  that  poor  and
illiterate women in rural areas and urban informal  settlements  know  their
rights. Women in these ares are still suffering from inequality,  abuse  and
the fact that most of these rural areas are inaccessible. Even if  a  woman,
or her children, experiences some form of abuse  or  domestic  violence,  it
becomes difficult for her to take action  against  the  perpetrator  because
she or her family is economically dependent on the perpetrator. That is  why
the victims, owing to these circumstances  and  even  pressure  from  family
members, sometimes withdraw cases of domestic violence after they have  laid
charges.
Since the introduction of the Domestic  Violence  Act,  there  has  been  an
improvement in the way the  justice  system  deals  with  domestic  violence
cases. If one looks at  the  sentences  handed  down  to  domestic  violence
offenders and at the abuse of women and children over the  past  two  years,
they are living proof that the Government is serious about  uprooting  abuse
and violence in family units.

One of the consequences of this Act has  been  an  increasing  workload  for
service  providers  like  the  SAPS,  the   Departments   of   Justice   and
Constitutional Development, of Health and of Social  Development.  Yet,  the
said departments have not been given more suitably qualified staff for  this
kind of work, sufficient equipment and resources,  as  well  as  support  to
carry out the duties related to this Act.

This has resulted in delays in rendering services to the public,  especially
the victims who then have  to  endure  the  trauma  of  waiting  for  longer
periods for their cases to be  finalised,  which  sometimes  means  enduring
more abuse in the process.
The Maintenance Act of 1998  has  also  brought  about  more  work  for  the
justice system, and this affects the processing time of  maintenance  cases.
The problems of insufficient staff and resources and  budgetary  constraints
compound the ineffective implementation of this Act.

There are also challenges posed by  the  long  processes  that  need  to  be
followed when applying for maintenance and the way  the  maintenance  system
is  designed,  which  is  not  user-friendly  for  illiterate  people.  Such
problems undermine the achievement of gender equality and  adversely  affect
mothers who have to take care of  children  without  the  support  of  their
fathers.

 The importance of these two Acts cannot be overemphasised. We  salute  this
House and the relevant stakeholders for all the efforts they have  put  into
ensuring that the rights of the most vulnerable citizens of the country  are
protected. We are also very encouraged by the progress that  has  been  made
so far regarding the implementation of these Acts.
However, the challenges of incapacity impact negatively on  the  realisation
of the objectives of these Acts, which makes  it  imperative  that  all  the
relevant stakeholders involved in  the  implementation  of  these  Acts  are
capacitated as a matter of urgency, so that we do not end up  with  a  white
elephant piece of legislation which does not serve the purpose for which  it

Ms M R MORUTOA: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  members  of  Parliament
and the public at large, I am making this speech on the  eve  of  us,  as  a
country, celebrating our 10 years of democracy, looking at what the  country
has achieved and at the challenges that lie ahead.

The ANC has been committed to the emancipation of  women.  It  is  the  only
organisation that pursued  the  eradication  of  the  triple  oppression  of
women. Women were oppressed at home  as  mothers,  at  their  workplaces  as
workers and, lastly, because of the colour of their skin,  as  black  women,
in particular. When the ANC came into power after  1994,  South  Africa  was
part of the SADC. It realised that the equal status and rights  of  men  and
women in marriage were neither recognised nor adequately protected  in  most
countries.

South Africa has put in place laws that provide  for  equality  between  men
and women in marriage. It has also been active in the SADC  region  and  co-
ordinated the 1998 SADC Conference on the  Prevention  of  Violence  Against
Women. The South  African  Constitution  entrenches  the  rights  to  gender
equality and to freedom from violence.

Our Government  has  committed  itself  to  promoting  gender  equality,  to
eradicating violence against women and to addressing  the  need  to  protect
vulnerable groups, such as women and children. The South African  Government
has definitely progressed in reducing violence against women, especially  in
areas such as domestic violence, rape and sexual harassment.

When  we  gained  our  status  as  a   constitutional   democracy   and   as
international citizens of good standing, the  legislative  process  resulted
in the production of an unprecedented body of laws that lay  the  foundation
for the transformation of our society. Based on the vision of  a  nonsexist,
nonracial democracy, our political leadership has made concerted efforts  to
put  in  place  a  gender-specific  legislative  framework  to  support  the
advancement of women.

This has been proven by a study tour to all  provinces,  undertaken  by  the
Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status  of
Women between April 2000 and May 2003. The oversight function was to  fulfil
the country's commitment to the Convention on the Elimination of  all  Forms
of Discrimination against Women, or CEDAW,  and  the  Beijing  Platform  for
Action.

This tour was also undertaken  mainly  to  collate  information  from  role-
players such as magistrates, prosecutors, NGOs, the SAPS and the  Office  on
the Status of Women, on the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act.  In
provinces  such  as  the  Northern  Cape,  the  intergovernmental  fora  are
focusing  on  matters  dealing  with  crime  prevention.   Magistrates   and
prosecutors are treating cases of this  nature  with  special  care,  unlike
during the days of the apartheid regime when  issues  of  this  nature  were
treated as one of those usual things that ought to  happen  to  women  as  a
punishment for being women. I know that during those days if  you  dared  to
report such an incident to the police, it was purported by those  blackjacks
and the police to be a family matter.  You  were  expected  to  succumb  and
would then be commanded to go back to  the  very  perpetrator,  without  any
legal action being taken or being provided with any security.

Sasisoyika kwa ukuyithetha into yokuba ubethwe ngutata  wekhaya.  Wawuxolela
ukuphosisa  uze  namaqhinga,  okuba  ungqubeke  eludongeni  okanye   udibene
nezigebenga. Ngelo lixa siphi isidima sakho sobuntu njengenkosikazi?

Kwezi  zixeko  besiye  kuzo  sixelelwe  ngamapolisa,  abatshutshisi  kakunye
namaqumrhu azimeleyo ukuba ayabafundisa abantu ngale  mithetho,  de  kubizwe
noogqirha besimo sengqondo ukuba bancede amapolisa ukuze amelane  nale  meko
ngoba aba hesheheshe ngenxa yokuhlala  esebenza  ngabantu  abaphantsi  kwale
meko.

Kukho nomthetho ongesondlo sabantwana. Lo mthetho ubalulekile  kakhulu  kuba
unyanzelisa  umzali  ukuba  akhuphe  isondlo  somntwana.   Ngelinye   ixesha
kuyanyanzeleka  ukuba  imali  ide  itsalwe  emvuzweni  womzali  emsebenzini.
Kweliya phondo laseRhawutini  ke  iyingozi  kwaloo  nto,  yokuba  loo  mzali
atsalelwe imali. Ikubeka  esichengeni  wena  mntu  ungumama.  Kuye  kufuneke
ukuba ufune ukhuselo.

Zibakho ke iingxaki xa le mithetho  isetyenziswa.  Phaya  eBrits  basixelele
abo   bakhokela   amapolisa   ukuba   asingawo   onke   amapolisa   awuqonda
ngokupheleleyo lo mthetho, besitsho ke kuba kucaca  ukuba  amanye  amapolisa
kuyafuneka  ukuba  afundiswe  ukuba  lo  mthetho  usetyenziswa  ngoluphi  na
uhlobo.  Ngelinye  ixesha  loo  mapolisa  sele  enolwazi  ayathathwa   asiwe
kwezinye iindawo, bashiyeke abantu beso sixeko bengenamncedi.

Phakathi kwenkosikazi nomyeni wayo,  ngelinye  ixesha  awusebenzi  ngendlela
elungileyo lo mthetho wokhuselo. Omnye  phakathi  kwabo  uye  asebenzise  lo
mthetho ukuze kuviwe ngaye apha endlwini,  nto  ke  leyo  emenza  ukuba  abe
nesigqezu xa ebona abantu,  loo  nto  ke  eyenza  ngoba  ephethe  le  ncwadi
imkhuselayo. Kukwanjalo  ke  nasemadodeni.  Lilonke,  le  mithetho  iluncedo
kuluntu lwethu. (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[One would not dare mention the fact that  one  had  been  beaten  by  one's
husband. One would rather tell a lie, and fabricate a story  to  the  effect
that one had hit one's head against the wall or that one  had  been  mugged.
And what about one's dignity as a woman?

In the areas we visited, the police, the prosecutors and the  NGOs  told  us
that  they  do  educate  people  about  these  laws,  and   that   sometimes
psychologists are called in to help the police because working  under  these
conditions affects them psychologically.

There is also a law regarding child maintenance. This law is very  important
because it obliges the parent to maintain the child.  Sometimes  maintenance
money is deducted from a parent's  salary  or  wages.  In  the  province  of
Gauteng, having maintenance money deducted from a parent's salary  or  wages
poses some danger. It makes you very vulnerable as a  woman.  Sometimes  you
have to apply for a protection order.

There are problems when it comes to implementing these laws.  In  Brits  the
leadership of the police there told us that  not  all  the  members  of  the
police understand this law fully, and that some of them need to  be  trained
in the implementation of the  maintenance  law.  Sometimes  members  of  the
police who are well versed in this  law  are  transferred  to  other  areas,
leaving the people of the area concerned with no one to help them.

The protection order sometimes doesn't  work  well  between  a  wife  and  a
husband. One of the two partners could use it  to  boss  the  other  partner
around, because she or he has the protection order. This applies to  men  as
well. All in all, these laws are helpful to our communities.]
In Kuruman there is lack of infrastructure, such  as  cells,  private  rooms
for victims and proper police stations. There are also not enough  policemen
and policewomen. Maintenance defaulters abscond to  other  provinces.  There
is a lot of misinterpretation of  laws.  This  means  that  collectively  we
should correct the situation.

There are many recommendations regarding  different  implementers  of  these
laws,  such  as  forensic  training  for  medical  practitioners;  increased
budgets; staff availability after hours; and ongoing  training  for  police,
judges, magistrates and prosecutors. We should  educate  people,  especially
women, on their rights; impose penalties for failure to perform duties;  all
survivors of abuse and rape should be accompanied to  hospitals  by  police;
and we should appoint maintenance investigators.

As we assess achievements over the past nine years and  concentrate  on  the
work that has yet to be done, we must, as  a  society,  ask  ourselves  what
practical steps we can take to enhance the efforts  of  Government.  We  all
know that Government is faced with many challenges and one of them  is  that
of  narrowing  the  gap  between  policy  and  implementation.  Thank   you,
Chairperson.

Mrs R  M  SOUTHGATE:  Chairperson,  the  committee  report  highlights  some
successes achieved by the two Acts under study in minimising  the  obstacles
faced by women. However, when we look at the  problems  highlighted  in  the
reports on the implementation of these  Acts,  then  the  lists  far  exceed
those of the successes achieved. Once again,  we  are  confronted  with  the
reality that legislation is only as effective as the  capacity  that  exists
to enforce it. It provides no comfort to the suffering masses of women  when
they  are  encouraged  to  acquaint  themselves  with   their   rights   and
obligations that control the respective legislation.

The  problems  that  the  report  highlights  are  not  insurmountable.  The
committee can help in this regard by insisting on  better  performance  from
those departments mentioned, within its own reference framework. Perhaps  it
may  be  required  from  the  JMC  to  hold  discussions  with  the  various
departments and stakeholders to discuss the feasibility of  certain  of  the
recommendations within the records.

The report suggests certain innovative  recommendations  for  consideration.
One is  the  establishment  of  a  specialised  family  court  dealing  with
domestic  violence.  This  may  help  to  provide   a   more   user-friendly
environment where victims can have the freedom to co-operate with the  state
to  assess  the  levels  of  domestic  violence  in  society   and   respond
appropriately. Perhaps the family courts  can  also  incorporate  a  special
sexual offences unit which may not  create  the  necessity  for  a  separate
special sexual offences court as recommended in the report.

With regard to discipline and performance duties  by  public  servants,  the
respective departments should take note of the recommendations made  by  the
committee. The recommendations to improve on the  speed  and  simplicity  of
application and process forms, should be taken  seriously.  Too  many  cases
are delayed due to unnecessary paperwork. Paperwork is not a  reflection  of
good service or the extent of the performance of a good day's work.  Service
delivery should be benchmarked. This report is but the  first  step  towards
the understanding of the magnitude of the jobs still to be  done.  The  next
step is to show willingness to improve on the current performances. I  thank
you.

Ms N C NKABINDE: Chairperson, hon members, the  Domestic  Violence  Act  and
the Maintenance Act are crucial pillars of the legal  framework  created  to
protect women and children from abuse and suffering.  The  extent  to  which
these Acts are successfully implemented will have a  direct  impact  on  the
overall constitutional commitment that we have  of  creating  an  equal  and
just society.

The committee and its chairperson  must  be  congratulated  for  undertaking
these study tours and compiling this comprehensive report, because our  duty
as legislators cannot merely be to sit here, removed from reality,  drafting
legislation and never bothering to  monitor  its  implementation.  What  the
report highlights is a host of problems,  regarding  the  implementation  of
both these Acts. When viewed as a whole,  this  range  of  problems  can  be
summed up as  a  lack  of  staff,  resources  and  skills  across  four  key
departments,  namely  Safety  and  Security,  Justice   and   Constitutional
Development, Health and Social Development.

In addition, there is an urgent need to raise public awareness  on  the  key
aspects of these critical Acts. What this means  -  and  we  should  not  be
ashamed to acknowledge this  -  is  that  Government  needs  to  drastically
increase funding to these key departments. Possibly, the ideal  solution  is
to specifically earmark such increased funding to show  that  it  is  to  be
used for the  correct  purposes,  and  that  reporting  and  monitoring  are
enhanced and the holistic management of the Acts can be attained.

What we urgently need  to  see  is  that  these  four  departments  and  all
stakeholders   collectively   and   individually   commit   themselves    to
prioritising the implementation of  these  Acts  through  their  statements,
activities and budget. Doing anything less than this, is  to  condemn  these
Acts to gather dust on library shelves and allow  the  continued  abuse  and
suffering of  women  and  children  to  continue  unchecked.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Dr S E M PHEKO: Chairperson, first of all I want to express my  appreciation
for the fact that the Joint  Monitoring  Committee  on  the  Improvement  of
Quality of Life and Status of Women undertook  a  study  tour  to  all  nine
provinces of our country between April 2000 and May 2003. This was  done  in
order to monitor the implementation of the Domestic  Violence  Act  of  1998
and the Maintenance Act.

The PAC holds that there is no way our country  can  fulfil  its  commitment
towards the Convention on the Elimination of  All  Forms  of  Discrimination
Against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action without a study tour  like
this one and the effective implementation of  international  instruments  as
well as our own domestic law.

Domestic violence against women must be uprooted. The Maintenance  Act  must
be a tool to facilitate the payment of maintenance which  is  often  avoided
by men after putting some of our  women  in  the  family  condition  out  of
wedlock or after divorcing them.

The recommendations  of  the  committee  with  regard  to  matters  such  as
forensic training for medical practitioners; ongoing  training  for  police,
judges, magistrates and prosecutors; education for our women,  survivors  of
abuse and rape, and family courts are commendable. However, in  the  African
cultural context, this so-called acknowledgement of  same-sex  relationships
is a  controversial  matter.  African  traditional  religion,  Christianity,
Islam and many other religions have always frowned upon it.

In recent weeks, we have seen the whole church in Africa defy  its  European
counterpart  on  this  issue.   Of   course,   homosexuality   has   serious
consequences for the underpopulation of Africa because these  people  cannot
bear any babies.  In  these  days  of  such  devastating  diseases  such  as
HIV/Aids, Africa will sooner rather than later be overrun  by  overpopulated
countries, and Africans will then be  permanently  robbed  of  ownership  of
this country and the continent of our ancestors.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I take this opportunity  to  congratulate  the
hon Mdlalose on her maiden speech. Well done.

The MF is pleased to note that great improvements have been noted since  the
enactment of the Domestic Violence  Act.  We  are  also  glad  to  see  that
progress in terms of this Act has been noted in the light of prosecutions.

With regard to prosecutors,  specialised  courts,  specialised  prosecutors,
service delivery, the SAPS prioritising domestic violence,  NGO  assistance,
magistrates and many other role-players, this  issue  of  domestic  violence
appears to have been taken very seriously.

Progress appears to have been made on the  Maintenance  Act.  However,  both
appear to have been met with a series of problems that both  dishearten  and
discourage. Many of these problems relay instances of a lack  of  initiative
and prioritisation by role-players  whose  duties  and  efforts  require  an
effective and efficient response to these serious offences.  It  is  crucial
that all SAPS members be equipped with  the  necessary  training  skills  to
handle cases of domestic violence. Further,  insensitive  behaviour  towards
victims of domestic violence of  same-sex  relationships  is  discriminatory
and unacceptable.

Domestic violence is an equally important  concern  as  any  other  criminal
offence. The MF  seeks  that  protection  be  provided  to  victims  in  the
interim. The collection of evidence has to be seriously improved  to  ensure
that justice may prevail. Many problems appear to be administrative. The  MF
feels that these loopholes may be filled by  effective  adjustment  and  the
provision of shelters. The MF  feels  that  the  state,  together  with  the
public and private sectors, should, through funding, ensure  the  safety  of
women and children who are victims of domestic violence.

Remaining problems facing cases of domestic violence need  to  be  earnestly
addressed. Loopholes in the Maintenance Act appear  to  be  similar  with  a
large backlog in administration, insufficient  staff  and  cumbersome  tasks
imposed on magistrates. These cause a lack of efficiency  that  hampers  the
success that the Maintenance Act was aimed at achieving.

With unemployment being such a major problem in our country, why is there  a
shortage of staff in our system? The MF feels that  we  would  be  assisting
ourselves in many respects by recruiting willing  candidates  from  a  large
resource of unemployed persons into this  sector.  This  would  activate  it
efficiently and ensure that maintenance issues  receive  the  prioritisation
they deserve.

The MF is impressed by the  task  team's  recommendation  that  has  clearly
drafted methods and aligned it to specific role-players  to  be  instituted.
The MF thanks the task team. [Time expired.]

Ms  N  E  LAMANI:  Mhlalingaphambili   namalungu,   okokuqala,   siyambulela
uRhulumente  okhokelwa  yi-ANC  ngokuthi  abe  nguyise  weenkedama,   indoda
yabahlolokazi, abe nabo  bazintsalu,  abajonge.  [Chairperson,  firstly,  we
thank the ANC-led Government  for  being  there  for  the  orphans  and  the
widows, and for looking after the destitute.]

Second of all,  I  would  like  to  outline  this  domestic  violence.  Many
different societies and nations, including  South  Africa,  have  for  years
been struggling  to  grapple  with  and  contain  the  problem  of  domestic
violence. In South Africa  this  phenomenon  coincided  with  the  country's
emancipation from the  long  years  of  apartheid,  segregation,  exclusion,
neglect and general  rights  abuse.  Since  South  Africa's  democratisation
process in 1994, issues of  gender  and  equality,  particularly  woman  and
child abuse, have received top priority from the new Government.

The ANC-led Government has committed itself to the eradication of all  forms
of violence against women. It stated  in  the  national  empowerment  policy
paper that it  intended  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of  the  Beijing
Platform for Action and in 1995 ratified the Convention on  the  Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. It  entrenched  the  right  to
gender equality and freedom from  violence  in  the  final  Constitution  of
1996.

As a committee, we visited Gauteng.  This  is  a  very  important  province.
Gauteng is a  unique  province  because  it  opted  not  to  have  a  gender
machinery such as the Office on the Status of Women based in  the  premier's
office, but in the social development department. We met with  the  director
and deputy director of social development and  we  were  informed  that  the
functions of  the  Office  on  the  Status  of  Women  are  performed  by  a
subdirectorate in  the  directorate  of  social  development,  that  is  the
subdirectorate on HIV/Aids and gender.

The role of this directorate is very interesting.  It  provides  support  to
the  premier's  office  on  gender  issues;  it  co-ordinates  and  provides
leadership to  ensure  that  departments  in  the  province  design  sector-
specific policies  and  strategies  to  address  gender-related  issues  for
employees - that is  interesting  -  and  citizens  within  communities;  it
liaises with Treasury with regard to preparations  for  integrating  gender-
specific  budgets  into  departmental  statements;  it  provides   strategic
support  to  provincial  departments  upon  request;  it   develops   gender
indicators and monitors the performance of departments  in  terms  of  these
indicators and it provides  the  legislature  and  others  with  reports  on
gender-related matters.

In our observations, the role of this subdirectorate  and  its  standard  of
performance are wonderful, and we were impressed.

With regard to their achievements, I need to make these  statements  because
from 25 November 2003 to 10 December 2003 we will be observing the  16  days
of activism during which we will be sensitising the  community  to  what  we
have done for women in the past 10 years.

The key achievement identified by the subdirectorate was the launch  of  the
Gauteng Provincial General Policy Framework. This policy  is  based  on  the
National Policy Framework for Women's Empowerment and  Gender  Equality.  It
is also guided by  the  Convention  on  the  Elimination  of  All  Forms  of
Discrimination Against Women and other SADC agreements. It  has  established
gender focal points in all provincial departments. This is interesting.

What is more interesting is the fact that the staff in gender  focal  points
will be trained and an audit on  senior  management  will  be  conducted  to
establish their training  needs  from  a  gender  perspective.  There  is  a
culture of inclusivity in this province.

Furthermore, a tender specification  for  capacity-building  programmes  has
already been designed. The whole exercise will  be  financed  with  Canadian
funding. There is also a plan to develop  gender  indicators  against  which
departments' performance will be monitored in terms of gender  mainstreaming
in their policies and programmes.

A strategy has also been developed to address  violence  against  women  and
children. The directorate has co-ordinated all departments  and  designed  a
strategy to address the problems. They  are  currently  in  the  process  of
developing a plan of action based on this strategy. The plan of  action  has
three points of intervention;  these  are  norms  and  standards,  capacity-
building and development of protocol for provinces.

We met the provincial women's caucus. It was  interesting.  We  exchanged  a
lot of ideas and they indicated that they will have  a  permanent  committee
to address gender issues with which we will be able to interact.

With regard to the SA Police Service, I was well impressed. It is  hands-on.
The register that is required for all cases of domestic violence  is  intact
and is being kept professionally. We had a  meeting  with  NGOs,  child  and
family welfare  societies,  safety  homes  and  organisations  that  provide
shelter for women and others. There was a lot  of  interaction  and  it  was
interesting to note the  manner  in  which  the  NGOs  give  effect  to  the
Domestic Violence Act requirements. They visit  police  stations,  they  are
well-equipped and they debated positively. The  police  reported  that  they
have a high rate of arrests for  incidents  related  to  domestic  violence.
Furthermore, the police themselves who are  involved  in  domestic  violence
will not escape arrest. This was interesting.

We had comments from people. People did not only complain  and  highlight  a
lot of problems, but they also made recommendations. They were  positive  in
their complaints. The common  problems  that  we  identified  regarding  the
three towns we visited were: that the legislation that has  been  passed  is
problematic at times; the issue of the protection  order  -  people  in  the
rural areas have no access to this order because of  transport  problems  at
times  -  and  also  that  during  the  weekends  officers  are  not  there.
Nevertheless, the awareness is there. We met  with  councillors.  They  also
came on board.
The NGOs and the community-based organisations were very  excited  and  they
are doing their job. It was interesting that the NGOs being  run  by  whites
were interested in even getting hold of the Act.  They  were  not  aware  of
this Act. But it was interesting to find that they now want to get  hold  of
it.

We met with magistrates. We had a meeting that was addressed  by  Magistrate
Dama of Johannesburg court, on behalf of all magistrates  in  Gauteng,  that
is Johannesburg, Pretoria and Vereeniging. From the outset, the  magistrates
acknowledged that training needs to be provided for them as they do not  get
enough training, and that despite the training they had received,  they  are
still trapped in the past, with some  police  officers  and  clerks  of  the
court still displaying bad attitudes towards women.  The  service  providers
must first deal with this attitude which  could  cause  a  lot  of  problems
regarding implementation.

Furthermore,  though  the  NGOs  are  doing  their  work,  they   experience
difficulties because they are not aware of the content of this Act.
Regarding the Maintenance Act, we should  applaud  the  Government  for  the
work that has been done. A lot has been done to improve this  Act.  We  have
inspectors that are going to be there on a daily basis.  There  are  trained
people that are going to trace the defaulters and this will be done in  such
a way that there will be communication with the Department of  Labour,  from
which they will get information. They will even go  to  traffic  departments
for information, which would be in a position to trace  the  whereabouts  of
defaulters. We are hands-on and we are going to make it happen.

We, as politicians, need to be aware of this. Let's  go  to  the  community.
The community should be involved in implementing the Domestic Violence  Act.
When kids are traumatised the educators need to be involved  and  be  hands-
on, so that we can deal with this effectively.

When I visited a police station at New Brighton, I found  that  NGOs  do  go
there, but they do not have the capacity and they have nobody to  report  to
except in the offices. However, the community-based  organisations  will  be
able to say, ``When we went to the police station, we found that there  were
indicators that in this area domestic violence has increased''.  Thank  you.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms T E MILLIN: Chairperson and hon members, the issues of  violence  against
women  and  child  abuse  are  unquestionably  at  the  root  of  the  moral
degeneration of society universally but we must, of  course,  focus  on  our
own problems. There are many factors that cause the problem, all well  known
and highlighted ad  nauseum,  and  all  the  abuses  stem  from  humankind's
disobedience,  indeed,  defiance  of  the  immutable,  unchangeable   Judeo-
Christian laws laid down for us in the ten Commandments of  the  Bible  and,
in similar vein, in the holy books of the other mainline faiths.

If we, in our feeble human capacity, attempt to  draft  and  implement  laws
that bypass, rationalise and even ignore these  unchanging  laws,  we  shall
continue to wander aimlessly  through  a  maze  of  dead-ends  without  ever
solving this or other crucial matters.
Indeed, we shall accelerate the breakdown  and  corruption  of  healthy  and
acceptable human conduct. Without a major societal  shift  towards  biblical
precepts, the basis for the majority of faiths in South Africa  or  parallel
values  of  the  other  mainline  faiths,  we  as  a  nation  shall   remain
rudderless.

It is a fact that churches in general are foundering on the shaky ground  of
secular humanism, having largely forsaken their  institutions  to  society's
manipulations, devices and desires to accept or reject  our  Creator's  laws
whenever inconvenient. Hence the festering turmoil.

With regard to the Bill of Rights in our Constitution, for  as  long  as  we
uphold the longest clause, that is clause 35, namely protecting  the  rights
of arrested, detained and  accused  persons,  without  a  similarly  lengthy
balancing clause protecting the rights of victims  with  the  provision,  in
the event of a clash, that  a  victim's  rights  take  precedence  over  the
offender's rights, we as legislators are nothing but  highly  paid  headless
chickens and society in general will continue to suffer violence and  abuse.
I  therefore  propose  that  the  constitutional  review  committee   should
urgently address the glaring shortcomings in the Bill of Rights with  regard
to victims' rights. [Time expired.]

Ms J MOLOI: Chairperson and hon members, our deepest sympathies to  the  hon
Kotwal and his family on the loss of  their  two-and-half-year-old  son  who
was buried yesterday. May they get the strength to deal with this  difficult
situation.

The attainment of political freedom and democracy  10  years  ago  presented
our  Government  with  the  twin  challenges  of  overarching  institutional
transformation on the one hand, while on  the  other  hand  formulating  new
policies in line with our democratic Constitution. This dual  challenge  had
to be faced within the  historic  context  of  our  South  African  colonial
apartheid past.

In the elaboration of our Government policies, programmes have been  put  in
place to dramatically create the requisite environment  for  us  to  restore
the  dignity  of  South  African   citizens,   especially   the   previously
marginalised women and children. The report before this  House  today  takes
its cue from the natural point of departure, which  is  to  bridge  the  gap
between what we said we will do and what we are actually doing as a nation.

An oversight role must be undertaken with a view to evaluate what works  and
what does not, and to guide those charged with  this  task  in  what  should
constitute the next move. As part of observations from  the  study  tour  on
the Domestic Violence Act,  awareness  is  already  spreading  amongst  most
communities through education programmes by the Government, NGOs,  CBOs  and
other relevant institutions.

We understand that this Act was established in order  to  prevent  and  stop
the abuse of women, and this is seen by most women as relief from the  ever-
prevailing situation that was  unbearable  for  them.  Confidence  is  built
amongst women and the high statistics  showing  cases  of  abuse  are  as  a
result of women opening up and speaking  out,  knowing  that  the  law  will
provide protection for them.

The establishment  of  specialised  courts,  particularly  in  KZN  and  the
Western Cape, further indicates  the  commitment  to  implement  these  laws
diligently.  Raising  consciousness  within  the  SA  Police   Service   and
prioritising domestic violence cases have proven to be positive factors.  Of
course,  a  continuous  training  programme  for  the  police,  magistrates,
prosecutors and judges has been identified as necessary.

The reporting and withdrawal of cases by most women proves to be  costly  to
Government's administrative function and the introduction of the  withdrawal
of cases only  by  senior  prosecutors  could  save  this  situation,  since
withdrawal will not be that easy.

A lack of infrastructure in  rural  areas  disadvantages  rural  women  with
regard to benefiting from these laws and  further  isolates  them  from  the
mainstream. This becomes an urgent situation  that  needs  attention.  There
arose a need between the SA Police Service  and  the  health  department  to
improve relations on handling matters affecting the  two  departments  in  a
professional manner. For instance, rape  victims  need  not  stand  in  long
queues for medical records and the doctors have to be  properly  trained  to
fill in medical forms in a way that would enable conviction as required.

Amongst the inputs made by communities, people  in  same-sex  relationships,
particularly males, indicated that they were harassed by  police  when  they
came to report their cases  and  are  told  to  fight  for  themselves.  For
instance, if a man comes and reports that his partner, who is  also  a  man,
has beaten him, the police ask him why he cannot fight for himself. How  can
he allow himself to be beaten by another man? We need  to  start  respecting
people's choices in terms of same-sex relationships and treat them as  equal
human beings. They  are  entitled  to  protection  and  human  dignity  like
everyone else.

With regard to  the  Maintenance  Act,  the  establishment  of  the  justice
college in Gauteng for maintenance officers, clerks and prosecutors came  as
a positive factor since there is a dire need to have a pool  of  specialised
staff to deal with maintenance cases.

An absence of investigating officers makes women vulnerable since they  have
to  investigate  the  details   of   perpetrators   themselves.   A   speedy
intervention in this area by the justice department will  be  of  much  help
for women who complain bitterly of this practice. In order for us to  insure
that issues affecting the emancipation of women are mainstreamed within  our
broad  transformation  programme  it  is  critical  that   we   continuously
strengthen the gender machinery that we have  initiated  in  Government,  in
Parliament, in independent bodies and in our communities.

The National Office on the Status of Women has developed a  national  gender
framework for women's empowerment and gender equality  as  a  broad  guiding
tool for overall gender implementation. The Office on the  Status  of  Women
has been established in  all  provinces,  including  KZN.  In  Gauteng  this
office is located within the social development directorate that deals  with
gender and HIV/Aids issues.

What needs to be noted is consistency in naming. That is, if it can also  be
named OSW like in all other provinces, gauteng will not be seen  as  defying
the establishment of this office while the office is fully  functional,  but
named differently.

Hierarchical accountability and reporting appear  to  be  a  common  problem
with the provincial offices on the status of women,  resulting  in  lack  of
influence in  decision-making  and  policy  implementation.  The  poor  role
played by departmental gender focal points appears to  be  a  constraint  on
the offices on the status of women, as opposed to the  head  of  departments
who have to take direct accountability on the  lack  of  implementation  and
mainstreaming within their line function departments.

A continuous gender training programme and conscientisation  at  all  levels
of management are highly recommended. We may not take it  for  granted  that
if a person is at the level of an HOD, automatically  the  issue  of  gender
will be mainstreamed. We need to make concerted efforts to  ensure  that  we
continously conscientise gender in order to have  a  fruitful  mainstreaming
at all levels of management.

A need to evaluate HODs on gender progress in renewal of  their  performance
contract is identified and is seen as a measure that will ensure that  heads
of departments consciously mainstream gender in their work.  The  Department
of Public Administration has to be central in monitoring this process.

The gender focal points in  national  departments  have  to  properly  guide
provincial gender focal points on policy implementation  to  complement  the
work of the offices on the status of women. A need has  been  identified  to
reinforce gender mainstreaming in the finance  department's  planning  unit,
accountable to the approval of the departmental business plan, in  order  to
ensure that budgeting considers gender  implementation  and  all  programmes
cover this factor.
All heads of various clusters have to report on  gender  implementation  and
the impact thereof. We have noticed that it has been the burden of  the  ANC
to ensure that gender representivity in Parliament  is  realised  and  other
parties have enjoyed a back seat on this critical task.

This situation should not escape them forever and we would  assist  them  to
think critically. This will happen by ensuring that we  develop  legislation
that will bind  the  representation  of  women  in  Parliament.  If  we  are
committed to nation-building, why  should  other  parties  be  casual  about
gender representivity? We have done so much as the ANC and they should  have
learnt by now. We remain prepared to take them through this  learning  curve
but it will be the hard way because now we have to pursue this task  through
legislation, lest it gets reversed.

The issue of solving domestic violence, including child molestation,  sexual
harassment and maintenance, can be properly facilitated through  the  social
partnership pact. Communities have to be at the forefront  of  dealing  with
this problem with the joint involvement of community  structures,  churches,
schools, police, prosecutors, magistrates, judges and social workers.

Involvement,  particularly  of  the  community,  proves  to  be   effective,
relieving Government of the burden to take on the  heavy  load  alone.  This
report is being tabled within the  16-day  period  identified  for  activism
against gender violence which started on 25 November and will  culminate  on
10 December.

It is not wrong to have men at the forefront of this campaign  in  order  to
correctly display  that,  as  part  of  society,  they  are  against  gender
violence and in order to state clearly that not all  men  are  violators  of
human rights, but  that  as  sensible  men  they  demand  a  healthy  living
environment for everyone and for the generations to come.

There are institutions already established that are  led  by  men  to  voice
their opinion on  a  violence-free  society.  We  have  to  thank  both  the
Chairperson of the NCOP and the Speaker of the National Assembly for  taking
us through the task of compiling this report. [Applause.]

Mrs S M CAMERER: Thank you, Chairperson. The DA believes that the  oversight
role of the joint monitoring committee is perhaps its most  important  work,
and the committee has done particularly  valuable  work  in  monitoring  the
implementation in the various provinces of these two statutes, the  Domestic
Violence Act and the Maintenance  Act,  which  are  of  such  importance  to
women. My colleague on the committee, the hon Janet Semple has asked  me  to
refer particularly to the implementation of the Domestic Violence Act.

This is a pioneering piece of  legislation.  I  introduced  its  predecessor
into Parliament in 1993, ten years ago. It was so often used by women,  even
during the first years of its availability, as a means to  restrain  violent
spouses, that the shortcomings of the first Act quickly became clear and  so
we were soon able to put on the  Statute  Book  a  much  improved  piece  of
legislation in the form of the present Act, passed in 1998.

The  fact  that  we  have  this  legislation,  and  that  it  works  and  is
extensively used, is the envy of women's organisations in many countries  of
the world.

In the past five years, since the Act was passed, reports that have come  to
Parliament have indicated that the main  problems  with  the  implementation
relate to the failure of the SA Police Service to  come  to  the  party  and
render the assistance as required in terms of the Act.

A detailed national instruction was issued by  the  SAPS  but,  as  National
Commissioner Selebi said shortly after taking  office,  the  SAPS  was  ill-
equipped and lacked the manpower to do what they were supposed to  do  under
the Act.

Unfortunately, as the report of the  joint  monitoring  committee  suggests,
although there  has  been  some  improvement  in  the  SA  Police  Service's
attitude towards the Act, some problems remain.

On the positive side, domestic violence against women and  children  is  now
regarded as a priority area for the SAPS and on the whole  its  members  are
aware of it and are treating it with the necessary seriousness. However,  in
Gauteng and Limpopo the committee was told that the police  did  not  regard
domestic violence as part of  their  official  workload,  but  rather  as  a
family matter and a burdensome additional activity. It therefore seems  that
the SA  Police  Service's  leadership  will  have  to  step  in  and  change
attitudes in these two provinces.

Training is also a big issue. It is clear that not  all  SAPS  members  have
received training in the implementation of the Act.  Some  prosecutors  have
also indicated that they do not feel equipped to deal effectively with  some
of the cases - particularly where sexual violence or  sexual  offences  have
taken place. This is of particular concern in view of the fact that the  new
sexual offences legislation will shortly be passed by this House. The  joint
monitoring committee recommends  more  extensive  and  compulsory  training.
Perhaps Justice College should reassess the needs of prosecutors as  far  as
training for domestic violence cases and sexual offences cases is  concerned
and step in with more specialised courses.

Another important point that the joint monitoring committee has  established
is  that  there  is  a  general  lack  of  infrastructure  to  support  this
legislation. For example, there are insufficient specialist family courts  -
a matter that  has  been  confirmed  by  oversight  visits  of  the  justice
portfolio committee. The joint monitoring committee recommends that they  be
established in every court district,  as  we  do  as  well  in  the  justice
portfolio committee. Secondly, there are insufficient  facilities  available
at courts to accommodate victims - separate waiting rooms  for  victims  and
witnesses are unheard of in smaller and rural courts.

Thirdly, the SAPS has insufficient vehicles and other resources.  And  there
is a lack of shelters to accommodate the  victims  and  their  children  who
wish to move from an abusive domestic environment. There is also  a  general
lack of mechanisms to protect the victims until an  order  -  a  restraining
order - is made final.  There  are  also  technical  difficulties  with  the
overlong and complicated application forms  for  interdicts  and  protection
orders.

This latter aspect can easily  be  dealt  with  by  the  Justice  department
bureaucracy and should be looked at as soon as possible.  But  the  lack  of
infrastructure is, as ever, a  problem.  The  criminal  justice  departments
have been starved of resources for a long period, and the  joint  monitoring
committee is clearly going to battle to get more  resources  allocated,  but
we can only try.

The best news from these reports is  that  there  has  been  an  incremental
change of attitude and awareness by police and  prosecutors  that  combating
domestic violence and assisting the victims is indeed  part  of  their  job.
The DA supports the report. Thank you, Chairman.

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Thank you,  hon  Chairperson  and  hon  members.  The  most
striking single social, political and economic transformation  of  the  past
century has been the emergence of women as  leaders  in  every  country  and
every walk of life. It is these  women  who  place  women's  issues  on  the
agenda and legislate for these issues. Our Parliament  is  demonstrative  of
this.

The Domestic Violence Act and the Maintenance Act are leading Acts  of  this
Parliament. Yet more often than not,  homes,  instead  of  being  places  of
safety and comfort, have  tragically  turned  into  places  of  torture  and
torment.

The IFP supports the report. It is frank and comprehensive  and  deals  with
issues as they are. For example, there is a  litany  of  problems  with  the
implementation of these Acts, ranging from withdrawal of cases  to  lack  of
support services. These issues are clearly articulated in  the  report,  yet
we need to go further and ask what is to be done.  The  gap  between  policy
and implementation needs to get smaller. There are real issues  of  capacity
and resources.

Women cannot be cheated out of  their  resources.  These  Acts  will  remain
pieces of paper  as  long  as  resources  are  not  set  aside  for  women's
security. More funding is  set  aside  for  sports  organisations  than  for
women's organisations and women's shelters.  Despite  the  strides  made  by
Government, despite women emerging as leaders, women need  to  feel  freedom
from fear. If we have achieved this, then we have won. And as we  strive  to
ensure that women are  kept  safe,  let  us  remember  the  African  saying,
``Paradise is open at the command of women''.

The IFP supports this report. Thank you.

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Chairperson, I think I must thank my colleagues, both  on
the left and the right side of  the  House,  for  taking  this  report  very
seriously. Indeed there is nothing in the sentence.  We  did  not  use  this
serious issue as a political football. I  do  believe  that  this  House  is
maturing. Perhaps the women in this House are maturing. [Applause.]

I will start off by looking at  the  definition  of  ``domestic  violence'',
which has, clearly, been described  effectively  in  the  Domestic  Violence
Act, Act 116 of 1998. I believe that it is important that all  of  us,  both
men and women, familiarise ourselves with the definition.

According to the Act, domestic violence means physical abuse; sexual  abuse;
emotional, verbal and psychological  abuse;  economic  abuse;  intimidation;
harassment; stalking;  damage  to  property;  entry  into  property  without
consent;  and  any  other  controlling  or  abusive  behaviour   towards   a
complainant.

I want to focus firstly on women in the rural areas, and then  on  women  in
traditional communities or under traditional councils. These are  the  women
who  experience  all  forms  of  abuse  in  their  daily  lives,  especially
intimidation,  and  verbal  and  psychological  abuse,  as  well  as   other
controlling and abusive practices.

This then takes us directly to the  Traditional  Leadership  and  Governance
Framework Bill, which was debated in  this  House  earlier  this  week.  For
instance, we have Sesi Phillia Shilubana, who has been told that:  ``Angekhe
aphathe  abakwaBaloyi,  ngoba  bona  angekhe   baphathwe   ngumuntu   ogqoka
ipitikoti [She will never be chief of the Baloyis because  they  will  never
be led by somebody who wears a petticoat].

Sesi Phillia Shilubana was told that she could not  be  the  kgoshi  of  the
Baloyi because they cannot be led by a person who wears  a  petticoat  or  a
skirt. This means that abuse is continuing in  South  Africa.  This  happens
despite the fact  that  we  have  a  Constitution  that  has  an  entrenched
equality clause; an equality clause that supersedes  custom,  tradition  and
religion.

We have raised these concerns together as women's  organisations,  NGOs  and
the Commission on Gender Equality many a time and  also  during  the  public
hearings on this Bill. I have read carefully the report from  the  Portfolio
Committee on Provincial and Local  Government,  of  the  National  Assembly,
which was a response to these concerns. Let me quote from the report:


  But, it has to be appreciated that while customs and traditions  are  not
  static, they have a momentum of their own. It is far  more  difficult  to
  effect  transformation  through  legislation  in  areas  of  custom   and
  tradition than it is in other aspects of society, for example  education,
  the economy or health care. Transformation in the  areas  of  custom  and
  tradition has to be phased in appropriately.

Nice English, hon members, kodwa ngesiXhosa, lo mbono  ufana  nqwa  nokuthi:
``Nyamezela  mntwan'am,  kunzima  emendweni''  [but  it's  like  saying   in
isiXhosa: ``Hang in there, my child, married life has never been easy''].
So, as women, we have to wait for these customs  and  traditions  to  follow
their course.

Ngokuya sasiphantsi kwengcinezelo yocalucalulo sasithi: ``Inkululeko  ngoku,
hayi ngomso.'' Amakhosikazi  atsho  njalo  nanamhlanje  ngokubhekisele  kulo
Mthetho  uYilwayo  ujongene  nezobukhosi,  ukuba:   Howu!   Kwanele   ngoku!
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[During  the  days  of  apartheid  we  used  to  say:  ``Freedom  now,   not
tomorrow.''  Today  women  are  saying,  with  regard  to  the   Traditional
Leadership and Governance Framework Bill: Stop! Enough is enough!]

We must see transformation.

Kudala sihlala phantsi kwengcinezelo, amakhulukhulu eminyaka. [We have  been
living under oppression for centuries.]

Enough is enough!

While we acknowledge  that  the  preamble  to  the  Bill  provides  for  the
institution of traditional leadership  to  be  transformed  and  brought  in
harmony with the Constitution and Bill of Rights, we believe that this  Bill
is a framework and must give guidance to provinces to the  effect  that  the
Constitution is the fundamental law of  the  country.  The  equality  clause
must be used as a guide, particularly  when  we  look  at  the  customs  and
traditions.

We believe that nonsexism and gender equality in all aspects  of  governance
are  fundamental  to  this  process.  The  rights  of  women  within   rural
communities should be  protected  and  extended  to  at  least  equal  those
enjoyed by men.

At this juncture, I also want to raise a major concern as far as  women  are
concerned, and that is around the delay of the passing of the Customary  Law
of Succession Bill, which is  also  linked  to  the  traditional  leadership
Bill.  This  Bill  has  to  be  amended  because  at  the   moment   it   is
unconstitutional. It has to  be  amended  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the
Constitution of the country.

As women,  we  would  like  to  know  from  the  Minister  for  Justice  and
Constitutional Development: When are we tabling and passing  this  Bill?  We
have been waiting for the Customary Law of Succession  Bill  to  be  amended
since 1994. We also want to know from the Minister for Provincial and  Local
Government the reason the issue of succession has  been  overlooked  in  the
Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill.

I would also like to comment on the Communal Land Rights Bill,  which  is  a
burning issue among our people, particularly women who  live  on  rural  and
communal land. The issue of traditional councils, which  predominantly  will
be responsible for land administration, is an  area  of  concern.  How  will
they be appointed? How  will  they  be  composed?  The  heavy  bias  towards
traditional leaders is a concern for women.

Women's organisations and human rights  groups  have  also  raised  concerns
around this Bill. Of particular concern to us  are  the  human  and  women's
rights, which are not effectively covered and protected in the  Bill  as  it
stands. We will raise other concerns with the relevant  committees  on  this
issue later. We believe, however, that we should mention them  because  they
are a matter of urgency and they also concern the issue of human rights.

I would like to raise a few issues on the findings of the  joint  monitoring
committee on the study tour to provinces. I'll  be  very  brief  because  my
colleagues, as I've already said, have largely covered the findings  on  the
Domestic Violence Act and the Maintenance  Act.  However,  I  just  want  to
mention a few issues around domestic violence and maintenance.

I want to commend the SA  Police  Service  in  particular.  They  were  very
committed and demonstrated their seriousness regarding  violence  and  abuse
of women and children. The SAPS has actually declared violence  against  and
abuse of women and children  a  priority  in  their  programmes.  Most  SAPS
members have been trained on the Domestic Violence Act and on how to  attend
to victims.

We were met by the most senior officials in the particular city  we  visited
or in that province, from the level of commissioner, and  they  were  always
punctual. Areas to improve on in this regard include resources and  budgets.
For instance, cars are not available for them to  respond  in  time  when  a
child is raped or when there is an emergency.

We would like, therefore, to  emphasise  budgeting,  especially  as  far  as
violence against and abuse of women are concerned, as well as in  regard  to
the Child Protection Units.

Let me take this opportunity to commend Government as well, for tabling  the
Sexual Offences Bill. We urge, however, that the definition of  rape  should
not be graded. Rape is rape, whether it is oral, genital, or  anal,  and  it
must be taken equally seriously in all circumstances so  that  we  can  have
effective sentencing of offenders. We also urge that treatment  be  provided
for victims, including postexposure prophylaxis for HIV/Aids.

Regarding maintenance, I just want to emphasise  the  need  for  maintenance
investigators. We appreciate the fact  that  about  55  of  them  have  been
employed on a six-month basis because of budgetary constraints. We urge  the
Ministry for Justice to ensure that in the next financial  year  we  have  a
sufficient budget for these maintenance investigators.

Ootata babantwana bayabaleka,  babalekela  eTranskei  nakwaVenda,  nto  leyo
ebangela ukuba  abatshutshisi  bangakwazi  ukubafumana.  [Many  fathers  are
running away from areas such as the former Transkei and Venda,  which  makes
it difficult for prosecutors to trace them.]

When we have dedicated investigators it is much easier to trace them.

To go back to my  focus,  the  national  gender  machinery,  South  Africa's
Policy Framework for Women's Empowerment and  Gender  Equality,  proposes  a
process that mainstreams gender in all spheres of life and in  all  sectors.
Therefore gender must be central to transformation in  all  our  structures,
institutions, procedures, practices and programmes of Government,  including
parastatals, the private sector and civil society.

To meet our international commitment to gender equality ...  such  as  Cedaw
and the Beijing  Platform  for  Action,  a  national  gender  machinery  was
established. The national machinery included the Office  on  the  Status  of
Women, the Gender Focal Point, CGE and the joint monitoring committee.

I think we have a number of achievements in this  area;  for  instance,  our
provincial and national  governments  are  gender-mainstreaming  programmes,
budgets and projects. The machinery should also take care of monitoring.

We have meetings with NGOs, which ensures that we work  together  as  women,
and together we also look at issues such as HIV/Aids,  home-based  care  and
domestic violence.

We also have programmes on  poverty  alleviation,  employment  creation  and
procurement opportunities for rural women. In particular, this has  happened
in the Free State, the Northern Cape and the North West.

The  OSW  has  provided  training  for  gender  focal  persons  in   various
departments. Some provinces, such as  Gauteng  and  the  Northern  Province,
have  developed  their  gender  policy  frameworks,  and  we  urge  all  our
departments and provinces to do the  same.  Nationally,  the  Department  of
Health has also developed its gender framework policy.

We want, therefore, to emphasise that  the  issues  of  rank  and  position,
skills and experience, and maturity of  persons  occupying  these  positions
are critical for them to be efficient. We also want to say that  their  rank
should be at director level, as gender policy stipulates, and they  must  be
placed in the DG's office or with the head of  department  at  national  and
provincial levels.

Lastly, I want to thank all those who  participated,  especially  the  NGOs,
the police, the magistrates and prosecutors, who were very helpful  in  that
they came forward with the necessary information. I also want to  thank  the
staff from Parliament that assisted us, especially the researchers, and  the
administrative staff that assisted us during  the  study  tours  and  during
preparations, and with logistics and compiling our report.

Last, but not least,  let  me  thank  the  portfolio  committee,  the  joint
monitoring committee members, who sacrificed  their  constituency  work  and
their family time and went out  to  participate  in  these  important  study
tours. I want to close off by calling on all of  us  to  join  the  national
campaign of ``No Violence against Women and Children'' from 25  November  to
10 December. However, we are saying that this must not be done  only  during
the 16 days; it must happen for 365 days, throughout the year. We must  all,
both men and women, be committed to it.

I would  like  to  commend  our  President,  who  took  a  leadership  role,
particularly at the launch of this programme last year  and  has  throughout
his speeches dealt with the issues  of  violence  and  abuse  all  over  the
country. I also want to urge all our leaders, all our religious  groups  and
all our  community  leaders,  men  and  women,  to  support  this  important
campaign. Thank you, Chairperson. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

National Assembly:

1.    The Speaker:


     (a)     Letter  dated  11  November  2003,   from   the   Minister   of
         Environmental Affairs and Tourism to the Speaker  of  the  National
         Assembly, in terms  of  section  65(2)(a)  of  the  Public  Finance
         Management Act, 1999 (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining  the  delay  in
         the tabling of the Annual Report  of  the  South  African  National
         Parks for 2002-2003:


              The tabling of the attached Annual  Report  of  South  African
              National Parks 2002/2003 has reference.


              In terms of  section  55(1)(d)  of  the  PFMA,  South  African
              National Parks in its capacity as Public Entity must submit an
              Annual Report to you  within  5  months  of  the  end  of  the
              financial year. The explanation for the delay in  the  tabling
              of the Annual Report of the South African  National  Parks  is
              that the final report was unsatisfactory and they appointed an
              external editor to put the finishing touches  to  the  report.
              This process delayed the production of  the  report  by  three
              weeks. The World Parks Congress  put  further  strain  on  the
              production of the report, as the persons primarily responsible
              for preparing the annual report were also principal organisers
              for the congress. This delayed the final product by a  further
              thirty days.


              In addition, the final printed product that was  delivered  to
              our offices had a number of pages missing from  the  financial
              statements. These copies were returned  to  be  reprinted  and
              these were delivered to our offices on 10 November 2003.


              Your understanding in this regard is highly appreciated.


              Yours sincerely


              Signed
              M V MOOSA
              MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM


     (b)     Letter  dated  12  November  2003,   from   the   Minister   of
         Communications to the Speaker of the National  Assembly,  in  terms
         of section 65(2)(a) of the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  1999
         (Act No 1 of 1999), explaining the delay  in  the  tabling  of  the
         Annual Report of the Universal Service Agency for 2002-2003:


              Dear Madam Speaker


              The reason for the late submission of the Annual Report is due
              to the departure of the CEO and CFO of the Agency at the  time
              when this Annual Report had to be prepared.


              Kindly accept our apology for the delay.
              Kind regards


              Signed
              IVY MATSEPE-CASABURRI, MP
              MINISTER
