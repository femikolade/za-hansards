                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr D K MALULEKE: Madam Speaker, I hereby give notice that I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) discuss the threats  by  the  ANC  Youth  League  to  let  loose  its
       guerrilla units on  the  Independent  Electoral  Commission  and  the
       citizens of the country;


  (2) notes the irregular actions of an ANC Free State candidate who  acted
       as both player and referee in that she was the IEC electoral  officer
       for the Dihlabeng Municipality during the voter registration weekend.

The SPEAKER: Notice will be taken of that. Are there any  other  notices  of
motion? Hon members, will you all take your seats. It's  very  difficult  to
know whether you want to give a notice of motion  or  not  if  you  are  all
standing up, and that applies to Ministers. Not you, Minister Asmal,  for  a
change.

              WINNER OF THE COMMUNITY BUILDER OF THE YEAR AWARD

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I  move  without
notice:

That the House -


     (1)    notes that -


         (a)     on 13 November 2003, in Sandton, Mama  Emelinah  Tembe  was
              chosen as the Community Builder of the Year; and


         (b)     Mama Tembe's selection is in recognition of her efforts  in
              initiating  the  Zamimpilo   Community   Market,   which   was
              established in 1979 with the aim of involving rural  women  in
              income-generating activities using natural resources;


     (2)    commends Mama Tembe's efforts and shares  the  pleasure  of  all
         South Africans at  seeing  the  market  becoming  a  major  tourist
         attraction  selling  homemade  traditional  artifacts   made   from
         natural materials such as reeds, grass and clay;


     (3)    expresses great joy at the fact  that  through  Mama  Tembe  the
         strength and heroism of rural women in particular -  who  bore  the
         brunt of apartheid exploitation  and  marginalisation  -  is  being
         acknowledged; and


     (4)    congratulates Mama Tembe on winning the Community Builder of the
         Year Award.


     Agreed to.

    SA GOLFING TEAM WORLD CUP TOURNAMENT VICTORY AND GOOD WISHES FOR THE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) congratulates the South African team  of  Trevor  Immelman  and  Rory
       Sabbatini who won the golfing World Cup  in  South  Carolina  at  the
       weekend to give South Africa its  fifth  victory  in  the  World  Cup
       tournament; and


  (2) wishes the international golfing team, under the  captaincy  of  Gary
       Player, every success against the American team  in  the  President's
       Cup golf competition which begins at the  Fancourt  Links  course  in
       George on Thursday.


  Agreed to.

                     `TOWARDS A TEN-YEAR REVIEW' BOOKLET

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M A TARR (ANC): Madam  Speaker,  this  House  takes  note  of  a  booklet
entitled ``Towards a Ten-Year Review'' produced and  published  by  the  ANC
Government as a discussion document. Two overall  questions  were  posed  in
this booklet, and  these  were:  Has  the  Government  achieved  its  policy
objectives? Are these the appropriate objectives?

Comprehensive research was undertaken to answer  these  questions  and  over
200 sources, including research articles and  publications,  are  quoted  in
the appendix. The main conclusion is that Government has adequately met  its
objectives and election promises. Advances made  in  the  first  decade  far
supersede any weaknesses but there  are  major  challenges  that  still  lie
ahead. Issues such as employment, crime, HIV/Aids, education,  etc  are  all
highlighted and discussed.

The other outstanding feature of  the  booklet  is  that  it  gives  a  good
insight into the ANC. There can be few other parties anywhere in  the  world
that are prepared to release the results of  a  study  that  so  openly  and
transparently deals with problems,  success  and  disappointments  of  their
first 10 years of governance.

Opposition parties should also realise that nearly  all  the  problems  that
face us, as a country, are a direct result of a legacy of  members  who  sit
in that party. [Interjections.] That is a  party  that  should  accept  some
responsibility for many of the  problems  that  face  us  and  play  a  more
constructive role in solving them. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

                     SOUTH AFRICA'S POSITION ON ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

The LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION: Madam Speaker, the South African  Government's
biggest moral, political and strategic failure  on  Zimbabwe  has  been  its
refusal to stare evil in the face and call it by its name.

President Robert Mugabe continues to violate human rights  and  to  suppress
democracy. Meanwhile, five-and-a-half-million people are  facing  starvation
in that country because of his  policies.  Throughout  the  year,  President
Mbeki gave assurances  to  world  leaders  that  a  solution  to  Zimbabwe's
problems was imminent. He reportedly promised US  President  George  W  Bush
that President Mugabe would step down by December.  We  are  less  than  two
weeks away from that deadline and there has been no progress whatsoever.
On Sunday, Makau Mutua, the Chair of  the  Kenya  Human  Rights  Commission,
said that, and I quote: ``Kenya should consider withdrawing  its  ambassador
from Harare to protest Mugabe's impermissible dictatorship.''

Last week, the former President of Botswana, Sir Ketumile Masire, said  that
the African Union should take  action  to  deal  with  Zimbabwe  because,  I
quote: ``Its credibility would be determined by the way it holds its  member
states accountable to its principles.''

Last month, at the conference of Liberal International  in  Dakar,  Senegal,
President Wade of Senegal told our gathering that President Mugabe  was  one
of the last obstacles, but also a decisive obstacle, standing in the way  of
progress and democracy on the African continent.

The tide of dissent is building; South Africa risks being  left  behind.  It
is time for President Mbeki to come out openly  against  President  Mugabe's
attendance at  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of  Government  Meeting  in  Abuja,
Nigeria, next month. Thank you. [Applause.]

                          WINE MAKING AND ADDITIVES

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr U ROOPNARAIN (IFP): Madam Speaker,  South  Africa  is  known  around  the
world for producing some of the best wines. Wines and wine makers  from  our
countries have won  numerous  awards  and  the  industry  has  an  excellent
reputation. The  reputation  of  the  industry  is  now  under  a  spotlight
following accusations that a few wine makers are illegally using  artificial
additives in some white wines to manipulate the flavours.

A resident of Paarl, in  the  Western  Cape,  was  found  guilty  of  adding
artificial sweeteners and water to wine. He was fined and  lost  his  liquor
licence. There are also four other cases pending for the same  charges.  The
wine industry is a multibillion-rand export industry that is very  important
to South Africa. We need to take drastic steps  to  weed  out  the  culprits
involved in this illegal activity  before  it  is  too  late  and  our  good
reputation and integrity are damaged. Thank you.

                           RACIST UTTERANCES BY DA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R R JOEMAT (ANC): Madam Speaker, the Preamble to our Constitution  reads
thus:


  We, the people of South Africa,
  Recognise the injustices of our past;
  Honour those who suffered for justice and freedom in  our  land;  Respect
  those who have worked to build and develop our country; and
  Believe that South Africa belongs to all who live in it,  united  in  our
  diversity.
  We therefore, through our  freely  elected  representatives,  adopt  this
  Constitution as the supreme law of the Republic ...

The Constitution goes further and locates at the centre of our value  system
the Bill of Rights and many other noble  values,  including  the  protection
and promotion of fundamental human rights, and  commitment  to  healing  the
divisions of the past - all  of  which  the  people  of  South  Africa  have
committed themselves to.

In light of the reported racist utterances by  DA  senior  members,  the  DA
therefore does not recognise the injustices of the past.  It  practices  and
promotes those injustices. They do not believe in  our  unity  in  diversity
and they continue to view some sections of our communities as subhumans  who
must be referred to in derogatory terms. The DA does not work  to  heal  the
divisions of the past; it seeks to entrench them. The DA  does  not  respect
human rights; it still works to  denigrate  other  people.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

                     AIDS PROGRAMME OF THE WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mev die Speaker, die Nuwe NP wil die Premier van die Wes-
Kaap en leier van die Nuwe NP, mnr Marthinus van Schalkwyk, baie geluk  wens
met die suksesvolle onderhandeling om R455 miljoen van die VN se fonds  teen
vigs te kry vir die provinsie. Met hierdie stap het die Wes-Kaap  weer  eens
bewys dat hy die leidende provinsie in Suid-Afrika is, veral wat betref  die
stryd  teen  MIV/vigs.  Die  Wes-Kaap  het   reeds   die   gevorderdste   en
doeltreffendste programme ingestel om die oordrag van dié siekte van  moeder
na kind te voorkom.  Hierdie  geld  sal  die  provinsie  in  staat  stel  om
antiretrovirale middels aan meer mense wat vigs het, beskikbaar te  stel  en
sodoende duisende mense se lewens te red of hul lewensgehalte  te  verbeter.
Die skenking is die grootste en belangrikste internasionale bydrae  tot  nog
toe aan die Wes-Kaap. Dit dien ook as 'n mosie  van  vertroue  in  die  Wes-
Kaapse regering se bestaande vigsprogram en die Nuwe  NP  is  trots  op  die
Premier en die provinsiale LUR vir gesondheid, wat in  samewerking  met  die
nasionale vigsraad,  hierdie  skenking  bewerkstellig  het.  Verskeie  ander
internasionale organisasies is reeds in die Wes-Kaap betrokke in  die  stryd
teen MIV/vigs. Die Nuwe NP doen 'n beroep op ander provinsies om by die Wes-
Kaap kers op te steek om hul eie programme teen MIV/vigs ook  uit  te  brei,
sodat dit net so suksesvol  soos  die  Wes-Kaap  s'n  sal  wees.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Madam Speaker, the New  NP  wishes  to  congratulate  the
Premier of the Western Cape and the leader of the New NP, Mr  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk, with the successful negotiations to obtain R455 million from  the
UN's funds to fight Aids in the province. With this step  the  Western  Cape
has once again shown that it  is  the  leading  province  in  South  Africa,
particularly concerning the fight against HIV/Aids.  The  Western  Cape  has
already implemented the most advanced and  efficient  programme  to  prevent
mother-to-child transmission of the disease. These  funds  will  enable  the
province to make available antiretroviral  medication  to  more  people  who
have Aids and in so doing save thousands of lives or improve  their  quality
of life. The donation is the  largest  and  most  significant  international
contribution to date to the Western Cape.  It  also  serves  as  a  vote  of
confidence in the Western Cape government's existing Aids programme and  the
New NP is proud of the Premier and the MEC for health who,  in  co-operation
with the National Aids Council, had made  this  donation  possible.  Several
other international organisations are already involved in the fight  against
HIV/Aids in the Western Cape. The New NP calls upon the other  provinces  to
join the Western Cape in expanding their own programmes against HIV/Aids  to
be just as successful as that of the Western Cape. [Applause.]]

                           REFORMATION CONFERENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs C DUDLEY (ACDP): Madam  Speaker,  on  31  October  1517,  Martin  Luther
posted his 95 theses in Wittenberg. By God's grace, Luther's courageous  act
of challenging the corruption  and  unbiblical  practices  of  the  medieval
Catholic hierarchy launched the great Reformation.

Martin Luther said:


  Unless I am convinced by Scripture or clear reasoning that I am in error,
  I cannot recant - for I am subject to the Scriptures I  have  quoted.  My
  conscience is captive to the word of God. It is unsafe and  dangerous  to
  do  anything  against  one's  conscience.  Here  I  stand,  I  cannot  do
  otherwise. So help me God.

To celebrate the Christian heritage of faith and  freedom  defended  through
the ages by reformers like John Wycliffe,  John  Hus,  Martin  Luther,  John
Calvin, John Knox and William Tyndale,  the  Annual  Reformation  Conference
was held in Cape Town in October.

As a result of the Reformation, the Bible is available  in  many  languages.
Scripture is recognised as the final authority and Christ alone as  head  of
the  church.  We  have  religious  freedom,  liberty  of  conscience,   free
enterprise, the rule of  law,  separation  of  powers  and  constitutionally
limited republics.

I proclaim this day, in the words of Martin Luther:
  If I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion
  of the truth of God except precisely that point which the world  and  the
  devil are at that moment attacking, then  I  am  not  confessing  Christ,
  however boldly I may be professing Him. Where the battle rages, there the
  loyalty of the soldier is proved; and to be  steady  on  all  the  battle
  front, besides, is merely flight and disgrace  if  he  flinches  at  that
  point.

Thank you.

The SPEAKER: I am sorry. ANC Whips, will you get your members organised.  Mr
Gomomo, you rose earlier.

                    ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P J GOMOMO (ANC): Madam Speaker, the following are  some  of  the  powers
and functions of the Public  Service  Commission,  as  set  out  in  section
196(4) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa: to  promote  the
values and  principles  set  out  in  section  195,  throughout  the  Public
Service;  to  investigate,  monitor  and  evaluate  the   organisation   and
administration, and the  personnel  practices  of  the  Public  Service;  to
propose measures to ensure effective and efficient  performance  within  the
Public Service; to promote in respect of its activities and the  performance
of its functions, including any finding and  advice  it  may  give,  and  to
provide an evaluation of the extent to which values and principles  set  out
in section 195 are complied with.

Given all  these  constitutional  provisions,  the  commission  still  faces
challenges of ensuring that, after doing  its  investigation,  the  measures
proposed are implemented. We have been able to ensure  that  our  commission
is staffed by people with the necessary knowledge and expertise and is  able
to do proper and sound investigation. A challenge is therefore upon  us,  as
Parliament, to ensure  that  the  commission  is  given  all  the  necessary
support in carrying out its activities.
The committee has satisfied itself that due consideration was given  to  all
applicants in a fair  and  equitable  manner,  taking  into  cognisance  the
requirements  stipulated  in  the  advertisement  and  the  broad  strategic
objective of our democratic Government of ensuring fairness.  The  committee
therefore moves for the adoption  of  the  report  as  per  the  ATC  of  17
November.

The SPEAKER: Hon Gomomo, you are moving the adoption of a committee  report.
We  are  taking  member's  statements;  we  will  assume  that  that  was  a
statement.

                       DISHONEST POLITICKING BY THE DA

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (VF): Agb  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  ons  word  op  'n  redelik
gereelde basis in hierdie Huis deur die DA  toegespreek  oor  moraliteit  en
korrupsie. Die DA is altyd baie gou om oneerlike politiek  en  korrupsie  te
veroordeel. Ons het dit vanmiddag weer gehoor.
Verlede Donderdag is ons op die  TV-nuus  vergas  deur  'n  groep  amateurs,
onder leiding van dr Tertius Delport. Sonder om te blik  of  te  bloos,  sit
hulle baie tevrede daar en vertel  vir  die  wêreld  dat  die  hele  VF-Plus
struktuur in Limpopo met 50 takke, en 3 000 lede nogal, na die DA  oorgeloop
het. Dit sou die provinsiale leier,  onderleier  en  jeugleier  insluit.  Só
gulsig en gierig is die DA om die VF by te kom, dat geen stappe gedoen  word
om hierdie leuens en vals inligting te bevestig nie. Nie 50 takke en  3  000
lede het na die DA gegaan nie, maar 'n halwe onwettige  papiertak  met  drie
familielede.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Niemand  in  die  posisie  van  provinsiale
leier,  onderleier  of   jeugleier   het   by   die   DA   aangesluit   nie.
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Die VF-Plus eis 'n openbare verskoning van die DA. Dit is hierdie soort  van
oneerlike politiek wat deur die DA bedryf word wat  alle  politici  benadeel
en kiesers skepties maak oor die politiek. Die arme  Afrikaners  in  die  DA
koukus is so oorywerig om hulle aan die DA leierskap te  bewys,  noudat  die
DA lyste saamgestel word, dat hul goeie oordeel hul hier erg  in  die  steek
gelaat het.
Dit word elke dag duideliker dat die DA sleg is vir  Suid-Afrika,  want  die
DA is nie net visieloos nie, maar  lei  kiesers  in  'n  doodloopstraat  van
sinlose  konfrontasie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Sies,  Tertius,  dis  'n  skande!
[Tussenwerpsels.] [Applous.] (Translation of  Afrikaans  member's  statement
follows.)

[Dr P W A MULDER (VF): Hon Speaker, we are addressed on a regular  basis  in
this House by the DA on morality and  corruption.  The  DA  is  always  very
quick to condemn dishonest politics and corruption. We heard it  again  this
afternoon.

Last Thursday we were entertained on TV news by a group of  amateurs,  under
the leadership of Dr Tertius Delport. Without  batting  an  eyelid,  sitting
there very smugly, they told the world that the entire FF-Plus structure  in
Limpopo, with its 50 branches and 3 000 members, crossed the  floor  to  the
DA. This would have included the provincial leader, deputy leader and  youth
leader. The DA is so hungry and keen to get at the FF  that  no  steps  were
taken to verify these lies and false information. Fifty branches and  3  000
members did not join the DA, but only half an illegal branch that exists  on
paper with three family members. [Interjections.] Nobody in the position  of
provincial  leader,  deputy  leader  or  youth   leader   joined   the   DA.
[Interjections.]

The FF-Plus demands a public apology  from  the  DA.  It  is  this  kind  of
dishonest politics practised by the DA  that  harms  politicians  and  makes
voters sceptical about politics. The poor Afrikaners in the  DA  caucus  are
so over-eager to prove themselves to the DA  leadership,  now  that  the  DA
lists are being compiled, that their good judgment failed them  dismally  in
this case.

Every day it becomes clearer that the DA is bad for  South  Africa,  because
the DA is not only without vision, it is also leading voters up  a  dead-end
of meaningless confrontation. [Interjections.] Shame on you, Tertius, it  is
a disgrace! [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

                       LAND OWNERSHIP IN SOUTH AFRICA
                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S E M PHEKO (PAC): Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the PAC  to  remind
the House that the issue of land in our country stubbornly remains the  most
defining political and development issue of the day. It is also one  of  the
most  contentious  issues  because  it  defines  and  exposes  the  property
relations of this country. It is clear that those who own land also own  the
means of production, control the economy and influence the politics  of  our
country mainly adversely. Unemployment will not be resolved until the  power
relations of the ownership of land are fundamentally redressed.

It is unacceptable to the PAC and the landless majority of our country  that
the majority in this country should own less land and be evicted daily  from
land while the minority owns land beyond its population figures.

Claiming land after June 1913 is no land reform,  it  is  national  suicide.
Section 25(7) of the Constitution must be amended. It is the only  way  that
land dispossession of the majority can be reversed and the national cake  of
our country equitably  shared.  Unemployment  in  the  country  has  reached
unprecedented low levels. Unemployed people earn no wages.  They  spend  and
save nothing. An economy with high  levels  of  unemployment  is  a  stalled
economy. Land is one of the sources  of  employment  creation.  Unemployment
can be drastically reduced ... [Time expired.]

                  RESTRUCTURING OF HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof B TUROK (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC shares the optimism expressed  by
all  stakeholders  in  the  higher  education  system  with  regard  to  the
restructuring  and  renaming  of  our  higher  education  sector.   Although
daunting, we believe that since there is no magic formula  to  transform  an
apartheid relic  of  this  enormity,  the  foundation  for  a  rational  and
seamless higher education system has been laid.

Within the context of our oppressive, exploitative  and  divided  past,  and
the  need  for  urgent  transformation  to  address  that  past  in   higher
education,  the  demands  for  equity,  increased  access,  human   resource
development, improved quality and the building of our intellectual  capacity
remain  paramount.  We  urge  all  stakeholders  in  higher   education   to
contribute to the effort of making our academic assets  fit  the  challenges
facing us as a developing country in the 21st century.

We commend the ANC-led Government on its continued commitment to  the  rapid
transformation of these institutions and have no doubt that the benefits  of
this project will be felt by learners and  society  long  into  the  future.
Thank you.

                             MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT

                            (Member's Statement)

Adv P S  SWART  (DA):  Mevrou  die  Speaker,  Nasionale  Kommissaris  Selebi
paradeer graag by ons grensposte. Hy impliseer dat hy ons  bekommernis  deel
oor die hoë vlak van motordiefstal in Suid-Afrika, maar hy misluk  jammerlik
om oplossings te bring. Daar word 300 motors per dag gesteel,  meer  as  100
000 per jaar, en dit is sonder die 5  000  verdere  kapings  per  jaar.  Die
konserwatiewe vervangingskade is ten minste R15 miljard  per  jaar  vir  die
slagoffers, maar vir die agb  Minister  Manuel,  ironies,  beteken  dit  ten
minste R2,1 miljard addisionele BTW.  Hierdie  geforseerde  bydrae  tot  die
staatskas is niks anders as 'n vorm  van  dubbele  belasting,  sonder  enige
toegevoegde waarde nie.

Word   die   agb   Minister   gekonfronteer,   beweer    hy    maklik    dat
versekeringsbedrog die grootste deel van hierdie nie-misdade  uitmaak,  maar
hy is nooit in staat om hierdie bewerings te steun met statistiek  nie.  Dis
blote bewering, of 'n gemaklike verskoning vir die Regering se  onvermoë  om
wesenlik op te tree.

Ek wil vandag vir die agb Minister sê die mense van  ons  land  is  vuisvoos
beroof en besteel en hulle blameer nie die polisie nie, maar  die  Regering.
Dit moet groot en helder waarskuwingsligte laat  flikker.  Die  DA,  as  die
verkose amptelike opposisie van hierdie onsuksesvolle Regering, sê  hard  en
duidelik: genoeg is  genoeg.  Julle  regeer  op  jul  laaste  geleende  tyd.
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Adv P S SWART (DA): Madam Speaker,  National  Commissioner  Selebi  eagerly
parades at our border posts. He implies that he shares our concern  for  the
high rate of vehicle theft in South Africa, but he fails miserably to  offer
solutions. Every day 300 cars are stolen, more than 100 000 per  annum,  and
that excludes the further 5  000  hijackings  per  annum.  The  conservative
replacement cost for victims  is  at  least  R15  billion  per  annum,  but,
ironically, for the hon Minister Manuel it means not less than R2,1  billion
additional VAT. These forced contributions to the treasury is  nothing  more
than a form of double taxation, without any value added.

When the hon Minister is confronted, he easily alleges that insurance  fraud
makes out the biggest part of these non-crimes, but  he  is  never  able  to
support these allegations with statistics. It  is  mere  allegation,  or  an
easy excuse for the Government's inability to take positive action.

Today I want to tell the hon Minister that the people of  our  country  have
been severely robbed and defrauded, and they do not blame the  police,  just
the Government. This should send out big and clear warning signals. The  DA,
as the official opposition elect of this unsuccessful Government, is  saying
loud and clear: enough is enough. You are governing  on  the  last  of  your
borrowed time.] [Interjections.]

                CALL FOR INVESTIGATION INTO SUSPECTS' ESCAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): Madam Speaker, the actions of  four  police  officers
who were on duty at the time  of  the  escape  of  seven  armed  and  highly
dangerous suspects from police cells is to be investigated.  The  prisoners,
wanted for crimes such as  murder  and  hijacking,  escaped  from  Littleton
police station after they  overpowered  a  police  constable  who  was  then
disarmed, bound,  gagged  and  locked  inside  a  cell.  The  escapees  then
overpowered three other policemen and fled with three guns.

In terms of regulations, the policeman should have checked on the  prisoners
in the company of at least one  other  police  officer.  Incidents  such  as
these cause people to lose faith in our justice system and nullify  all  the
hard work done by the police officers  who  arrested  the  suspects  in  the
first place.

We sincerely hope that the investigation sheds some light on the  escape  of
the suspects in order to prevent similar incidents  from  occurring  in  the
future.

                    STATE VISIT BY PRESIDENT OF BRASILIA

                            (Member's Statement)
Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  coming  from  a  working  class
background myself, may I take this  opportunity  to  salute  President  Liuz
Ignatio "Lula" da Silva, a hero of the working class.  The  state  visit  of
the President of Brasilia to South Africa is the first  of  its  kind.  This
visit marks a significant step in the consolidation of the warm and  cordial
relations that already exist between our respective countries.

Brazil has the largest  population  of  people  of  African  origin  outside
Africa. Brazil and South Africa have  identified  each  other  as  strategic
partners in the international arena owing  to  the  shared  viewpoint  on  a
number  of  crucial  international  issues.  Brazil's  new  foreign   policy
orientation is driven by domestic demands that are very much  in  line  with
or similar to those of South Africa. Brazil  shares  South  Africa's  vision
regarding multilateralism as the only viable approach to  addressing  global
issues.

We share a commitment to respecting  the  rule  of  international  law,  the
strengthening of the United Nations including the UN  Security  Council  and
prioritising the use of diplomacy as the means to maintaining  international
peace and security in accordance with the Charter of the UN.

The ties between our two countries have already been tested  at  the  recent
ministerial meeting of the World Trade  Organisation  in  Cancun.  President
Lula's visit to South  Africa,  coming  close  on  the  heels  of  President
Mbeki's visit to India, laid the basis for the  creation  of  a  network  of
strategic allies who can work together  for  a  better  world  for  all  the
people of the nation. [Time expired.][Applause.]

                          APPOINTMENT OF SABC BOARD

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs ANNA VAN WYK (New NP): Madam Speaker, the preamble of  the  Broadcasting
Act of 1999 speaks of the diverse  nature  of  South  Africa,  ie  that  the
broadcasting system is controlled and managed by persons or  groups  from  a
diverse range of communities and must reflect the multilingual  and  diverse
nature of South Africa.

It is required that 12 nonexecutive members of the SABC Board  be  appointed
by the President on the advice of the  National  Assembly.  I  call  on  our
colleagues in the ANC to adhere to the objects of the Act and to follow  the
most sensible and  conciliatory  spirit  of  the  law  when  weighing  their
decision. It is not too late to revise that list.

Section  4(c)  states  that  members  of  the  board   must,   when   viewed
collectively, represent a broad  cross-section  of  the  population  of  the
Republic. This is not the case.  The  list,  as  it  now  stands,  does  not
include a single Afrikaans-speaking person. Neither does it  include  anyone
with expertise in general broadcasting product.  The  New  NP,  regrettably,
cannot support this list. Parliament must fulfil its mandate to  the  people
of the Republic of South Africa.

I exhort the House to advise the President correctly before he  applies  his
mind. Further, in section 13(4)(b),  these  persons  must  be  committed  to
fairness, freedom of expression, the right of the  public  to  be  informed,
openness and accountability on the part of those holding public  office.  It
is a matter of public record  that  not  everybody  among  the  persons  now
nominated is so committed. Thank you. [Applause.]

                  RESTRUCTURING OF HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I wish to  thank  the  hon  member
for raising the issue  of  the  reconstruction  and  transformation  of  the
higher education system. All I wish to add is simply to  say  that  part  of
the reason for this major reconstruction effort is to  improve  the  quality
of research, teaching and community involvement, which are  the  trinity  of
the purposes of higher education. It is very important that the  quality  is
improved, because we  have,  for  example,  a  wastage  rate  of  first-year
students that is too large. The improvement rate of those who  finish  their
degrees is very low.

And these are the fundamental issues that cost the state about R1,4  billion
every year. But the fundamental fact is that we should not treat  our  young
people in this cursory fashion. It is vital that we  draw  on  the  capacity
and the talent of  all  our  young  people  and,  therefore,  regard  higher
education as the pinnacle of the education system. There is no  doubt  about
this.

The World Bank was wrong when they emphasised  basic  education  and  it  is
South Africa who got the World Bank to change its position on that.  So  the
World Bank was wrong, because the higher education system provides not  only
more trained  people,  such  as  our  intellectuals,  who  are  particularly
important for the development and education of black intellectuals in  South
Africa, and our scientists and researchers, but also provides that  critical
scrutiny into public life which I think we must encourage. For  example,  if
the whole question of academic freedom means anything, it  must  be  in  the
capacity to look into the soul of the nation and to write about it.

The other factor is simply that, emerging from higher education,  there  are
hundreds of students for whom there are no jobs of any kind,  because  there
is no rational planning in higher education. We  have  hundreds  of  B  Comm
degrees and scores and scores of  diplomas  in  public  administration,  but
there are no jobs for that. This arose because  universities  competed  with
each other and now we want to remove that competition and have  co-operative
governance. Thank you very much for this  opportunity  to  add  to  the  hon
member's statement.

                          ESCAPE OF FOUR CRIMINALS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY  AND  SECURITY:  Thank  you,  Madam  Speaker.  I  am
responding to two statements which were made in the House.

The first one I want to respond  to  relates  to  the  escape  of  the  four
criminals from our holding cells. And I do want  to  agree  that  we  cannot
tolerate occasions  of  this  kind  in  South  Africa.  We  have,  in  fact,
instituted an inquiry to determine whether this  happened  as  a  result  of
laxity on the part of any police official. And,  of  course,  we  will  deal
with whoever has been found to be in  default  of  their  responsibility  in
regard to this matter.

When the hon Paul Swart stood up to speak,  I  was  very  happy,  because  I
thought that he had been reinstated  as  the  spokesperson  for  safety  and
security by the DA. But it immediately became abundantly clear  to  me  that
they  were  hauling  him  in  simply  as  a  courier  of  the   paucity   of
understanding of security matters within the DA. And from what he says,  one
can  understand  why  some  of  the  police  officials  who   perhaps   were
sympathetic to the opposition are now walking  away  from  them.  He  stands
here and he says: "I am  not  blaming  the  police  for  weaknesses  in  the
programme to combat crime. I am blaming Government."
Now that shows you how poor their understanding of this matter is. I do  not
want to spend more time responding to him, except to say that I really  hope
the time will come when these hon members will raise the debate about  crime
combating and prevention in South Africa to a respectable level.  Otherwise,
the issues that were raised here in  the  House  do  not  actually  merit  a
reasonable response. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, just on a  point
of order: In the course of member's statements, the hon member Van Wyk  made
a statement pertaining to the issue of the SABC Board. That  matter,  as  we
understand it, is on the Order Paper for tomorrow. We ask that you  consider
whether this is not going against the  Rule  of  Anticipation  contained  in
Rule 68 and perhaps make a ruling accordingly at a later stage?

The SPEAKER: I can take that on board. Thank you very much.

                         REVENUE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL
The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Madam Speaker.  Hon  members,  you  will
recall the introduction of the Exchange Control and Taxation Laws  Amendment
Bill earlier this year. We raised issues  related  to  amnesty  and  various
rate adjustments that  were  announced  on  Budget  Day.  The  Revenue  Laws
Amendment Bill deals with the remaining tax proposals and  related  matters.
It, therefore, proposes amendments to a wide variety of tax  laws.  Many  of
these amendments are textual or technical in nature, so I  will  concentrate
on some of the more significant aspects.

Firstly, there is the removing of tax on certain dividend repatriation.  The
current  system  of  taxation  of  foreign  dividends  has  the   unintended
consequence of discouraging the  repatriation  of  dividends.  This  follows
from the fact  that,  where  a  dividend  is  taxable,  a  taxpayer  with  a
meaningful interest in a company may use his or her influence to  delay  the
declaration of dividends by that company.  It  is  therefore  proposed  that
dividends be exempted from taxation where a taxpayer holds more than 25%  of
the ordinary shares in the company declaring the dividend.

This measure is underpinned by the  existing  anti-avoidance  provisions  of
the  controlled  foreign  company  rules.  Additional  provisions  are  also
proposed to prevent the round-tripping of deductible expenditure for  exempt
foreign dividends. As members will recall, this was  a  significant  problem
prior to the introduction of the taxation of foreign dividends.

Moving closer to home, a number of  our  larger  cities  suffer  from  urban
decay. This means that valuable infrastructure that has  been  built  up  in
the past is underutilised and is, in some cases,  decaying  along  with  the
areas it services.

The reversal of this trend where it occurs is a  substantial  challenge  for
both local  government  and  national  Government.  In  order  to  build  on
national  Government's  contribution  in  addressing   the   challenge,   an
accelerated depreciation allowance is proposed for urban development zones.
This allowance is granted to taxpayers refurbishing  existing  buildings  or
constructing new buildings within demarcated urban  development  zones.  The
criteria for demarcating these zones  have  been  designed  to  ensure  that
areas in decline are targeted  and  to  ensure  that  local  government  and
national  Government's  efforts  reinforce  one  another.  Strong  reporting
requirements have been included for taxpayers, municipalities and  SARS,  so
that the progress of this initiative can be evaluated  by  Parliament  on  a
regular basis.

Of course urban development is not just a  matter  for  Government  and  the
private sector. Public  benefit  organisations  are  also  involved.  It  is
therefore proposed that a number of public benefit activities  in  the  area
of land and housing  be  added  to  the  list  of  activities  granted  tax-
deductible status. In addition, it is proposed that a substantial number  of
activities in the areas of welfare and humanitarian health  care,  education
and development activities be added to the list of activities  granted  tax-
deductible status. This adds up to a substantial expansion of the list.
Thirdly, in respect of exchange  control  amnesty,  as  I  announced  in  my
Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement last Wednesday,  the  closing  date  for
the amnesty is to be extended to 29  February  next  year.  The  legislative
amendments to effect this extension are  included  in  the  Bill.  They  are
accompanied by a small number of amendments that seek to clarify  provisions
of the legislation that are being misinterpreted in practice and  to  extend
the amnesty.

Fourthly, we have the ring-fencing of losses from  certain  suspect  trades.
Madam Speaker, it is an unfortunate fact that certain taxpayers  attempt  to
disguise their private or hobby expenses as trading activities. There is  no
reason why the general body of taxpayers  should  subsidise  the  inevitable
losses, so a balanced set of rules are proposed to identify and limit  these
losses. It is important to note that the losses are limited  and  not  lost.
This ensures that those losses are available to be set  off  against  future
income from trade in those cases where,  despite  numerous  escape  hatches,
the rules are triggered by legitimate trade.
Taxpayers engaged in legitimate trade will  welcome  a  number  of  stimulus
measures that were announced on Budget Day, but, without going into  detail,
these include the indefinite extension of the accelerated  depreciation  for
manufacturing,  a  system  of  comprehensive  business  asset   reinvestment
relief, the modernisation of the research and development provisions in  the
Income Tax Act, and a  double  deduction  of  up  to  R20  000  of  start-up
expenses for small business corporations.

Similarly, other developments include the  dispute  resolutions,  and  these
now also include the provisions in the Customs and Excise Act.

In conclusion, Madam Speaker, the Bill contains  various  other  significant
measures such as those relating to the Customs and Excise Act,  but  in  the
interest of time I have focused only on the more important ones.

Madam Speaker and hon members, I hereby table  the  Revenue  Laws  Amendment
Bill, 2003. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Thank you, Minister. The Bill  is  referred  to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

          ELECTION OF MEMBERS TO MEDIATION COMMITTEE ON LIQUOR BILL

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Hon members, on 13 November, the  House  refused  to  pass  the
Liquor Bill as amended by  the  National  Council  of  Provinces.  The  Bill
passed by the National Assembly and the amended Bill passed by the  National
Council of Provinces are therefore referred to the Mediation  Committee.  In
terms of section 78 of the Constitution, read with  Assembly  Rule  225  and
226, nine members of the National Assembly are to be elected  by  the  House
to serve on the Mediation Committee.

According to the formula contained in the Rules, six members should be  from
the ANC and one each from the DA, the  IFP,  and  the  New  National  Party.
These members are to be nominated by the  respective  parties.  Parties  may
also nominate alternate members for election. I will therefore now  call  on
the ANC to nominate its six members.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, we wish to propose  the
following six members from  the  African  National  Congress:  Ms  Elizabeth
Thabethe, Dr Rob Davies, Ms Connie  September,  Mr  Lewele  Modisenyane,  Ms
Elizabeth Ngaleka and Mr Sam Louw. We so propose, thank you.

The SPEAKER: Was that six? I may have missed someone. Sorry. Are  there  any
objections to those names? No objections. Agreed to. ANC,  do  you  wish  to
nominate alternate members?

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Yes, Madam Speaker, we wish to do so.

The SPEAKER: Please proceed.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: We put forward the names of Mr  Fezile
Bhengu, Ms Bongi Maria Ntuli, Mr Langa Zita,  Mr  Moses  Kgwele,  Ms  Farida
Mahomed, and Mr Obed Bapela. Thank you.

The  SPEAKER:  Are  there  any  objections  to  the  alternate  members?  No
objections. It's agreed to. I now  call  upon  the  Democratic  Alliance  to
nominate its member.

Mr I  J  PRETORIUS:  Agb  Speaker,  ek  stel  Mnr  Mark  Lowe  voor,  en  as
alternatiewe lid Mnr J L Theron. [Hon Speaker, I propose Mr Mark  Lowe,  and
Mr J L Theron as alternative.]

The SPEAKER: Are there any  objections  to  the  member  and  the  alternate
member? No objections. It's been agreed to. I  now  call  upon  the  IFP  to
nominate its member.

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, the IFP wishes to nominate the  name  of  Dr
Usha Roopnarain as the main member, and the alternate member, Mr B C Ngiba.

The SPEAKER: Are there any objections? No objections. That has  been  agreed
to. The New NP, I now call upon you to nominate your members.

Mr D M BAKKER: Speaker, we nominate Dr R T Rhoda as the member, and Dr  S  J
Gous as the alternative.

The SPEAKER:  Are  there  any  objections?  There  are  no  objections.  The
Mediation  Committee,  the  National  Assembly  component,  has   now   been
nominated, and the committee will now proceed with its work.

 CONSIDERATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FILLING OF VACANCIES IN PUBLIC SERVICE
                                 COMMISSION

Mr P J GOMOMO: Madam Speaker, the following  are  some  of  the  powers  and
functions of the Public Service Commission, as set out in section 196(4)  of
the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa:


  (1) to  promote  the  values  and  principles  set  out  in  section  195
       throughout the Public Service;
  (2)  to  investigate,  monitor  and   evaluate   the   organisation   and
       administration, and the personnel practices, of the Public Service;


  (3) to propose measures to ensure  effective  and  efficient  performance
       within the Public Service;


  (4) to promote respect for its activities  and  the  performance  of  its
       functions, including any finding and advice it may give; and,


  (5) to provide an evaluation of  the  extent  to  which  the  values  and
       principles set out in section 195 are complied with.

Given all these constitutional provisions, the commission  still  faces  the
challenge of ensuring that the measures which are  proposed,  after  it  has
done its investigation, are implemented. We have been able  to  ensure  that
our commission is  staffed  by  people  with  the  necessary  knowledge  and
expertise, and that it is able to do proper  and  sound  investigation.  The
challenge is therefore for us, as Parliament, to ensure that the  commission
is given all the necessary support in carrying out its activities.

The committee has satisfied itself that due consideration was given  to  all
applicants in a fair  and  equitable  manner,  taking  into  cognisance  the
requirements stipulated  in  the  advertisements  and  the  broad  strategic
objective of the democratic Government of ensuring fairness. The  committee,
therefore, moves the adoption of the report as per the  ATC  of  17 November
2003, because it believes that these are the people  who  will  ensure  that
there is efficiency in the Public Service. I thank you. [Applause.]

Question put: that the recommendation by the Portfolio Committee  on  Public
Service and Administration of Mrs N Mxakato-Diseko, Mrs K Mokgalong, Mr J  H
Ernstzen, Dr E G Bain and Prof S S Sangweni for appointment  to  the  Public
Service Commission be approved.

The SPEAKER: Hon members, clearly there is approval.  However,  section  196
of  the  Constitution  requires  that  the  National  Assembly  approve  the
appointment of the commissioners with the supporting vote  of  the  majority
of members. We will, therefore, need to record  the  names  of  the  members
supporting the recommendation.

The bells will thus be rung for five minutes.

       DEBATE ON REPORT OF JOINT RULES COMMITTEE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF
    RECOMMENDATIONS OF JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Report on  Oversight
and Accountability adopted by the Joint Rules Committee in March  this  year
represents the beginning of an attempt by Parliament to introspect, to  take
stock of how far we have come  in  meeting  our  constitutional  obligations
that we may as a Parliament better serve the people we represent.

This process began through the initiative of the Speaker who in 1999 ...

The SPEAKER: Hon member, would you pause? Those who are  leaving  would  you
please do so in silence and not cause disruption. Please proceed.

Ms F I CHOHAN-KHOTA: ... appointed senior academics to conduct research  and
produce a trilogy  of  reports:  the  first  one  dealing  with  powers  and
privileges, the second dealing with  delegated  legislation  and  the  third
dealing  with  oversight  and  accountability.  These  three  reports   were
referred to three  different  ad  hoc  subcommittees  and  today  it  is  my
privilege  to  introduce   the   findings   and,   most   importantly,   the
recommendations  of  the  Ad  Hoc  Joint  Subcommittee  on   Oversight   and
Accountability.

Our approach in the committee has been  a  practical  one.  As  members  who
operate and interact with the institution  on  a  daily  basis,  we  have  a
fairly good idea of the areas of shortcomings.  We  dealt  with  issues,  no
doubt as had originally been intended, in a manner that contributes  to  the
transformation and construction of the institution of Parliament as part  of
the systematic and ongoing process of entrenching democracy in our country.

At this juncture I must point out  that  the  annexure,  as  it  appears  in
today's  ATC,  only  contains  three  of  the  10  recommendations  that  we
originally made and I propose to deal with all of those  recommendations  in
my speech today.

To  begin  with,  the  question  arises:  What  is  oversight  and  what  is
accountability? Many people do not realise that Parliament not  only  has  a
lawmaking function but a vested interest in how these laws are  implemented.
As a new and young Parliament, those of us who are  actors  in  shaping  and
modelling this august body have a special responsibility to build  a  strong
foundation upon which a dynamic institution  may  evolve.  In  engaging  our
oversight activities we have a dual task - one that  involves  understanding
and constantly developing our constitutional powers and functions,  as  well
as performing our tasks to the best of our ability.

In evidence presented to the subcommittee we found no uniform  practice  and
understanding in this regard. Some committees  function  in  a  manner  that
allows  little  or  no  delineation  between  themselves  and  their   focus
departments. On the other extreme, some operate in  a  more  confrontational
manner, while still others cut a fine and healthy balance between these  two
extremes. In this regard it is our view that the development of a sound  and
common understanding of our oversight role is critical.  Our  recommendation
is for a constitutional landscaping document to  be  developed  specifically
for MPs that traces the  conception  and  development  of  the  concepts  of
oversight, accountability, transparency and responsiveness within the  South
African context. We also propose, as a second step in this development of  a
common understanding, that a series  of  discussions  and  debates  be  held
between MPs mutually and later between MPs and other stakeholders.

Given that ours is a constitutional state the discourse  must  of  necessity
have a legal  dimension.  But  in  addition,  it  is  our  belief  that  the
discourse must have  regard  to  the  political  debate  that  informed  our
constitutional design. Key constitutional negotiators should be  invited  to
document their thoughts and arguments  for  both  the  sake  of  ensuring  a
national repository of  information  that  will  guide  present  and  future
members of Parliament, as well as for the sake of posterity.

The two Houses of Parliament operate  independently  and  concurrently  with
each other. Each House has a  unique  orientation  with  specific  oversight
objectives. While  there  are  areas  of  exclusive  competence,  there  are
equally areas of concurrency inasmuch as there may be room for  facilitating
joint oversight work from time to time.  We  propose  a  co-operative  ethic
whereby there is no duplication, but a mutually  complementary  role  played
by each House through its relevant committee. We  make  recommendations  for
the construction of a formal communication mechanism between the  committees
of the two Houses and suggest that guidelines be prepared to facilitate  the
joint planning, whenever necessary, of oversight work.

The co-ordination  and  structuring  of  work  between  the  two  Houses  is
critical for the optimal functioning of Parliament. This co-ordinating  role
at a functional level  will  necessarily  involve  the  realignment  of  the
committee section.

The next matter concerns the very, very  important  issue  of  capacity  and
resources to committees. My colleague, the hon Mr  Jeffery  will  deal  with
this matter in greater detail during his input. Suffice it to  say  at  this
stage that the most effective oversight machinery is  indeed  the  portfolio
and select committee systems. From what began as  elaborate  rubber-stamping
vehicles of the old apartheid government, our committees in Parliament  have
succeeded, in a relatively short space of time, in coming  into  their  own.
Through these committees our country  has  all  but  pushed  back  the  very
frontiers of the apartheid  barricade  of  discriminatory  legislation.  But
there's not only that. We have  in  this  Parliament  succeeded  in  passing
legislation  that   has   become   model   law   for   the   continent   and
internationally. This is, and should be, a source of immense pride  for  all
hon members, particularly when regard is  given  to  the  relatively  sparse
resources at the disposal of individual committees and committee  chairs  in
particular.

Our view is that building the institutional capabilities of Parliament is  a
process that will extend well into the  next  few  parliamentary  terms.  We
propose a comprehensive vision and mission process that  will  have  as  its
goal  improving  the  in-house  capabilities  of  Parliament  in   all   its
dimensions  -  whether  its  committees,   constituency   offices   or   the
administrative support structures.

Arguably the most important challenge that Parliament has to face, in  light
of its oversight responsibilities,  is  the  construction  of  an  effective
research  and  monitoring  capacity  that   allows   for   the   independent
acquisition of  information  regarding  implementation  of  policy  and  the
exercise of public function. Add to that the restructuring of the  committee
system where a record-keeping system and a  tracking  mechanism  has  to  be
introduced. While suggesting these reforms, we  are  constantly  mindful  of
the fact that these  changes  will  have  to  be  gradually  phased  in.  We
therefore recommend that each new and  successive  Parliament  assesses  and
reviews its oversight capabilities at least once during its  five-year  life
span.

Outside of on-site inspections and visits to provinces,  committees  by  and
large,  in  performing  their  oversight  functions,  rely  on   information
supplied by the very departments of state that they are  meant  to  oversee.
It is in this context  that  we  propose  the  development  of  an  in-house
mechanism capable of independently  acquiring  information.  A  proposal  is
made in the report  that  we  tabled  that  in  the  medium-term  Parliament
considers developing more effective links with bodies engaged  in  oversight
work of their own. A prime example  in  this  regard  would  be  the  Public
Service Commission. In this regard the relationship between  Parliament  and
all Chapter 9 bodies will need to be considered. We propose  a  consultative
process through which the sensitive issue of independence may  be  canvassed
and  worked  through  to  hopefully  result   in   a   mutually   beneficial
relationship with each of the institutions supporting  democracy.  Again  my
colleague, the hon Mr Jeffery will deal in more depth with this issue.

The  development  of  an  institutional  memory   for   Parliament   is   an
indispensable element in building Parliament's  oversight  capacity.  It  is
our view that, while our focus  has  necessarily  been  on  the  areas  that
require interventions and fine-tuning, there are some excellent examples  of
oversight work being conducted and enormous experience gained over these  10
years, which should not be lost to Parliament. Much of this expertise  rests
with committees and chairpersons of committees.

In this regard we recommend that Parliament takes steps to  develop  a  best
practice guide drawn  from  the  best  practices  of  those  committees  and
experiences of those chairpersons who perform outstanding work. In a  direct
response to the constitutional  provisions,  we  make  two  recommendations.
Firstly, section 55(2) requires the National Assembly to  maintain  exercise
of,  inter  alia,  any  organ  of  state.  In  the   Sarfu   judgment,   the
Constitutional Court determined that,  in  deciding  whether  a  body  is  a
public body or not, regard should be had to its function and not merely  the
functionary itself. This means that over  and  above  the  large  number  of
public bodies that may be  classified  as  organs  of  state,  even  private
bodies performing a public function could  fall  within  the  definition  of
organ of state. This  area  represents  a  huge  challenge  for  Parliament.
Indeed, when one considers the very many bodies that we are  meant  to  hold
accountable as MPs, we begin to  appreciate  that  we  have  only  begun  to
scratch  the  surface  insofar  as  our   constitutional   obligations   are
concerned.

We therefore recommend, in this regard, a three-pronged  approach  beginning
with an audit and classification of  these  bodies,  the  development  of  a
policy specific to this  constitutional  clause  and  the  consideration  of
basic legislation dealing with those organs of  state  directly  accountable
to Parliament.

The second area in which we respond directly to a constitutional  obligation
is the area of the Budget. We note in  our  report  that  Parliament's  four
main constitutional obligations and functions are linked.  The  drafting  of
legislation, conducting of oversight, the passing of the Budget as  well  as
its  amendment  are  all  linked.  In  our  report  we  consider  four  main
principles for the more active engagement by  Parliament  in  the  budgetary
process. Firstly, Parliament should  not  in  any  way  assume  any  of  the
inherent functions of the executive or, to put  it  differently,  Parliament
should recognise that the drafting of a  national  Budget  is  an  executive
function.

Secondly,  Parliament,  like   other   stakeholders,   should   develop   an
influencing role for itself  during  the  compilation  of  the  Budget.  The
greater part of Parliament's influence should be focused on the  compilation
stage, and amendments to the Budget should be affected only in  extreme  and
extraordinary contingencies.  Examples  of  these  could  be  a  significant
incongruence  between  spending  and  delivery  targets,  where  policy  and
spending priorities do not match, or in the event  of  extreme  departmental
waste  or  inefficiencies.  Parliament  we  believe  will,  by  using  these
principles,  be  able  to  develop  a  stronger  influencing  role  in   the
development  of  the  country's  Budget.  And  legislation,  to   meet   the
obligation in section 77(2)  of  the  Constitution,  we  believe  should  be
drafted accordingly.

Under the title, ``Fine-tuning and  Developing  Oversight  Mechanisms'',  we
suggest that policy allowing more time for oversight  work  be  adopted  and
that oversight work essentially becomes more mainstream parliamentary work.

Finally, the committee considered the issue of an  accountability  standards
Act, which was originally  favoured  by  the  consultants  who  drafted  the
initial report. In this regard, two views prevailed in the subcommittee  and
both options are to be found in our report. These  recommendations  are  not
mutually exclusive and may be married under the first option.

Option one proposes that Parliament first develop  its  oversight  processes
and conventions. These are to be captured in a manual  to  be  updated  from
time to time to clarify issues and elicit certainty on matters such  as  how
entities are expected to proceed in  accounting  to  Parliament.  Parliament
will at a future time be able to assess whether  it  is  required  for  such
procedures and practices to be captured in legislation.

The second option proposes  that  legislation  be  adopted  as  a  twin  act
complementing the PFMA. Such an Act would  regulate  the  accountability  of
state departments in relation to  policy  matters  as  opposed  to  spending
matters, which is what the PFMA does. This is still a matter that is  before
the Joint Rules Committee  and  the  decision  in  this  regard  as  to  the
preferred option is still outstanding.

The report tabled today outlines the detailed  proposals  we  have  made  to
implement these recommendations, and without  going  through  them,  let  me
take this  opportunity  to  refer  members  to  them  as  they  happily  are
correctly captured in the ATC.

Lastly, let me take the liberty  of  thanking  the  people  who  rarely  get
thanked in this House. A big thank you to Ms Nomfundo Mpuntsha-Ntintili,  Ms
Viveca Abrahams and Mr Benny Nonyane, who provided secretarial services  for
us, as well as Mr  Keith  Woodman,  who  assisted  a  great  deal  with  the
compilation of  the  report,  Mr  Kamal  Mansura  for  his  helpfulness  and
guidance, Mr Hahndiek for his expertise that he shared,  and  thank  you  to
all  the  members  who  helped  in  creating  this  report.  And  thank  you
especially for the spirit in which we were able  to  work.  I  cannot  leave
this podium without thanking Mr Cassim especially, whose enthusiasm in  this
regard was most palpable. Thank you, Sir. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Ms M SMUTS: During  the  ad  hoc  committee's  deliberations  on  Prof  Hugh
Corder's report on oversight and accountability, his colleague at UCT,  Prof
Christina  Murray,  together  with  Leah  Nazinc,  published  the  following
findings in their survey entitled Building  Representative  Democracy.  They
found that South African legislatures have not been particularly  active  as
overseers of Government action.

Politicians, they said, have a much poorer understanding of  oversight  than
of their law-making responsibility. There is  also  little  agreement  among
members as to what oversight means in practice and how it should be  carried
out. This finding was borne out by Parliament's Mr  Kasper  Hahndiek.  There
is, he told the sub-committee, no consistent understanding and  approach  to
the exercising of the oversight role.

The degree of co-operation between committees  and  departments  varies.  In
some cases,  it  is  hostile  and  in  some  committees  there  is  a  close
relationship; sometimes so close that the necessary separation of powers  is
not maintained.

This being the case, this  debate  offers  an  opportunity  to  refresh  hon
members' memories as to our role in the scheme of things. The South  African
Constitution entrenches a separation of powers between  the  executive,  the
legislative and the judicial branches with checks  and  balances  to  ensure
accountability, responsiveness and openness.

Members of the executive, with the exception of the President,  remain  MPs,
as in parliamentary  systems  everywhere,  but  their  duty  to  account  to
Parliament has been explicitly constitutionalised and so  has  the  duty  of
Parliament, our duty, to hold them to account.

Here is the constitutional section 42(3) that describes our role:


  The National Assembly is elected to represent the people,

Not ``the parties'', but ``the people''.


  and to ensure government by the people under the  Constitution.  It  does
  this by choosing the President, by providing a national forum for  public
  consideration of issues, by passing legislation and by  scrutinising  and
  overseeing executive action.


Section 85 is the one that describes how the executive works. It  says  that
the executive authority of the Republic  vests  in  the  President,  and  he
exercises  his  authority  together  with  his  Cabinet  by,  for   example,
implementing the legislation that we produce here, except  where  a  law  or
the Constitution provides otherwise. He exercises  his  authority  with  his
Cabinet by developing and implementing national policy;  and  here,  by  the
way, adherence to  the  Constitution  applies  just  as  much  as  when  the
executive is implementing laws. Policy on HIV-Aids, for example, has  to  be
constitutional.

The  President  co-ordinates  the  functions  of   state   departments   and
administrations  and  so  forth,  and  for  all  of  this,  the  Cabinet  is
collectively and individually accountable to us and must report to us.  Now,
to make it quite clear that we must hold the executive to  account,  section
55(2) requires that we must  provide  for  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the
executive organs of state are accountable and that  we  maintain  oversight,
and that is the subject matter of the report that is serving before us.

Parliament is a separate, a distinct and a very powerful arm  of  state,  or
is supposed to be and used to be. We have watched with  rising  concern  how
ANC MPs, during the life of this Parliament, have begun to take  their  lead
and, it must be said, sometimes their instruction from  their  party  rather
than representing the people, as section 42 requires.

The most current example is the selection of an SABC  Board,  with  which  I
will deal tomorrow. If that is the most current example, then the arms  deal
remains the most egregious. As Prof Murray said, it is equally serious  that
Cabinet members and the MECs often do not understand or do not  support  the
oversight responsibility of the legislatures.  Now,  in  my  view,  the  hon
Minister of Sport would be a good example of one who  does  not  understand,
judging from what I read from time to time in  an  equally  confused  press,
about his attendance  act  and  his  participation  in  portfolio  committee
meetings. I've even seen the  committee  being  described  as  a  Government
committee, for heaven's sake!

Those members of the executive who do not  support  the  oversight  function
are many,  judging  from  the  sad  history  of  Scopa  and  also  of  Pregs
Govender's quality of life committee. She tried to  hold  the  executive  to
account for its constitutional duties  towards  women  suffering  from  HIV-
Aids, but she was effectively rendered powerless by the shortcomings of  the
current accountability mechanisms.

The fact is that it took Constitutional Court action by civil  society  even
to trigger the still incipient process of ARV roll-out, and that  is  a  sad
reflection on Parliament.

Now, in these circumstances, it  is  necessary  to  strengthen  Parliament's
powers and its resolve and to set out clearly what it can and  must  do.  In
our view, Prof Corder  cut  right  to  the  heart  of  the  matter  when  he
recommended an accountability standards Act.

There are, as my friend the hon Fatima Chohan-Khota has  said,  two  options
and two approaches to this proposal in our final sub-committee  report.  The
Joint Rules Committee will decide which option to choose after work  by  the
proposed  projects  component  or,  indeed,  whether  a  third   option   is
desirable.

Just to  recap,  the  majority  party  on  the  sub-committee  felt  that  a
stringent legal framework would be  premature,  that  it  could  stifle  the
growth of an oversight culture and introduce self-imposed  limitations.  For
our part, we feel that the oversight culture may itself be stifled,  if  not
strangled at birth, and that  an  eventual  law  which  does  no  more  than
concretise and codify progressively meeker best practice  may  not,  indeed,
meet the constitutional imperatives.

It's little wonder in the current atmosphere  that  our  report  itself,  at
times, became contested terrain. We do welcome the fact  that  the  ANC  has
ultimately not dismissed the idea of an accountability law  and  we  welcome
the task team, but we do  fear  that  an  ongoing  round  of  workshops  and
landscaping projects may just go around and around in a new Parliament,  and
that the parameters that we need may never be set.

We propose that the accountability Act be enacted as a  companion  piece  to
the Public Finance Management Act, as has  been  said  here.  No  comparable
instrument exists in regard to policy and government  programmes.  That  new
law  should  deal   with   issues   like   the   doctrine   of   ministerial
responsibility.  That  is  a  nineteenth-century  doctrine  which  has  been
described as having only fading utility in modern states.
The fact is that the Directors-General, nowadays,  take  responsibility  for
policy matters and outcomes that used to be  dealt  with  by  the  political
heads of departments, yet the old convention puts them beyond  scrutiny  and
beyond criticism. In South Africa, under President Mbeki, moreover, the  DGs
are appointed directly by the President. In the case of  a  department  like
Home Affairs, this has created enormous difficulties for the Minister.

Now, we need a law that formalises the relationship  between  Ministers  and
Directors-General,  and  clearly  allocates  the  responsibility   and   the
accountability. Once this has been done, we should deal also with  the  fact
that  ministerial  responsibility  in  South  Africa   is   not   merely   a
constitutional convention, but has the force of law.

We do not, as the DA, suggest that  the  courts  should  be  able  to  force
Ministers to resign,  but  Parliament  should,  indeed,  be  able  to  bring
political pressure to bear, which might result  in  the  ultimate  political
sanction. If that sounds shocking, bear in mind that, after all,  Parliament
can remove the President himself from office, under section 89.

I ask hon members to ask themselves the question: Should we, as  Parliament,
not also be able to force out of office Ministers of  Health,  for  example,
who fail their constitutional duties?  I  leave  these  thoughts  with  you.
Madam Speaker, we look forward to the task team's work under, I  hope,  your
personal command.

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  I  will  first  make  a  very  general
observation and then perhaps move on to one or two specific issues which  we
would like to ponder.

The chairperson  of  the  subcommittee,  the  oversight  and  accountability
subcommittee, I think, is quite correct that there  is  much  to  recognise,
much to be proud of regarding the oversight performance  from  a  number  of
our committees.  I  think  a  number  of  committees  are  chaired  by  very
proficient chairpersons and have  members  who  are  diligent  and  have  an
understanding of what the oversight responsibilities are.

But, on the other hand, I think, the hon  Smuts  is  also  correct,  namely,
that  quality  of  oversight  and  performance  across  the  mechanisms   of
Parliament is not uniform. There  are  committees  that  are  fairly  inept,
where there are weak chairpersons, where there are  unenthusiastic  members,
where members obviously do not do their homework  and,  let  me  say,  where
perhaps opposition parties are not always as  ferocious  and  insightful  as
they should be.

So, we have a mixed performance of oversight in  this  Parliament,  in  this
National Assembly, and I think Professor Corder  in  many  respects  in  his
initial report early in 1999 referred to some of these weaknesses  and  some
of the potential for these weaknesses to exacerbate  themselves  over  time.
And I think he alluded very astutely to many of the actions  we  could  take
to try and correct, to try and strengthen, through the  Rules,  through  our
understandings, our general approach and general practices of oversight.
It is sad and very disappointing from our party's point of view  that  there
appears to be a lack of urgency, a lack of will by the Rules  Committee  and
its subcommittee to really take these issues of oversight seriously  and  to
expedite them.

If we consider that consultants were employed early  in  1999  and  produced
their poor report midway through 1999, we now are  almost  five  years  down
the road, and where have we got to? We have got to today where  in  the  ATC
we see something that says the implementation plan of  the  subcommittee  of
the Rules Committee and some resolutions. And if we  look  closely  at  what
this implementation plan says, and what these resolutions say, firstly,  you
will see that it is not an implementation plan at  all.  There  is  no  plan
with substance of what we are going to  do  regarding  oversight.  And  that
applies to the resolutions as well.

Now, one can look at every paragraph of what has been recommended here.  All
it is saying is that we had five years of process; we are now  going  on  to
the next processes. And of course we know that there  is  an  election  next
year and that is just going to delay matters even further.

So, the will  is  simply  not  there.  We  passed  very  complex  pieces  of
legislation in this Parliament, far more complex than  simply  the  type  of
Rules  that  will  govern  Parliament,  Rules  for   which   there   is   an
international body of experience, which is well  documented.  The  practices
are well-articulated.  Our  Constitution  is  nothing  exceptional  in  this
regard. There are experiences there which we could put in place  very,  very
quickly. And they would be the right practices.

But we are not doing this, and as I say,  we  can  deal  with  very  complex
pieces of legislation very efficiently.  But  when  it  comes  to  a  simple
matter of rules where the either/or options for us are very  plain  to  see,
as Corder pointed out five years ago, all we come up with today  is  another
bunch of resolutions which is: "Let us  compile  another  document.  Let  us
form another committee. Let us have another debate."

So, where are we really going with this? And is the National Assembly -  and
Parliament,  should  I  say  -  serious   about   really   taking   on   its
responsibilities of oversight?

That was my general point. I wanted to make two specific points. The one  is
on Chapter 9 bodies. There Corder  quite  clearly  said  Chapter  9  bodies,
section 181 of the Constitution, are accountable to the  National  Assembly.
We know section 55 says we have to have mechanisms, so all we have to do  is
set up a mechanism. The only option, in Corder's  point  of  view,  was  the
mechanism exclusive, a mechanism for each Chapter 9 body. Would we have  one
committee for all of them or would we try to filter them  through  the  most
relevant portfolio committees?

I mean, it is a very simple choice. There are no other options.  Five  years
down the road we have got no further. I must inform the  committee  that  we
are sitting in a subcommittee at the moment, writing  up  the  Public  Audit
Bill for the Auditor-General.

And we will be recommending to the National Assembly  that  it  really  gets
its act together on this particular issue and sets up a  committee  that  is
going to allow the Auditor-General - a very important Chapter  9  body  whom
we all rely on, because he goes across all  departments  and  all  financial
transactions are governed - to make sure that this oversight body is put  in
place for the Auditor-General.

So, hopefully, with some urging from a  subcommittee  and  some  legislation
that will come before this committee next week, together with a  report,  we
might try and put some pressure on the situation.

The only other specific issue I want to mention here - and  it  also  refers
back to Corder, and  in  fact  the  hon  Smuts  referred  to  it  -  is  the
accounting standards Act which he proposed. As the hon Smuts  has  said,  he
sees it in direct relation to the Public Finance Management Act.

I think it is a great shame that the Public Finance  Management  Act,  which
is based on very clear accountability arrangements, is not being  introduced
in the way it should be. It is a very soft  version  of  the  Act  which  is
compromising the accountability arrangements we intended,  and  compromising
our ability for oversight, simply because those accountability  arrangements
insisted on more information, more  relevant  information,  not  just  about
finances, but about delivery.

So, each committee here should be getting far better reports about  what  is
actually happening  in  each  and  every  department  and  other  Government
institutions. That is not happening the way the PFMA  has  been  enacted.  I
would hope, in conclusion, that most of all these committees  and  processes
and debates will give more serious issue to a proper implementation  of  the
PFMA and consideration  to  the  accounting  standards  Act  that  is  being
proposed. Thank you.

Ms S D MOTUBATSE-HOUNKPATIN:  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  some  of  the
principles of democracy are consultation, debate on  issues  and  reporting.
And this is what the ANC is about. Our Constitution has also made  provision
for the establishment of institutions that support democracy.

Parliament  has  a  role  to  monitor   all   Government   departments   and
institutions. As a constitutional principle, it  should  be  borne  in  mind
that Parliament has persuasive  powers  in  the  form  of  legislation  over
Government, and not instructive powers. However, flowing from this  is  that
the premise  for  the  relationship  at  this  level  is  to  guard  against
temptation by the executive to abuse power.

Depending  on  countries  and  democracies,  or  practices  that   different
societies or governments use, such relationships are either loose or  tight.
If we take the example of  the  United  States,  the  relationship  is  even
stricter because sharing of personnel between the two agencies  is  strictly
forbidden. The assumption is that it encourages more accountability  on  the
part of the executive or the government.

Democracy also puts  responsibilities  on  public  representatives  and  the
public at large.  In  the  very  institution  of  Parliament,  we  have  the
executive which is also made up of members of Parliament,  unlike  in  other
countries. In other countries, once a person is elected to the executive  he
or she resigns from Parliament. In our case, it means that our executive  is
also accountable to Parliament. In the past years we  have  maintained  that
this obligation of accounting and  performing  management  responsibilities,
and taking care of resources entrusted to them, is  fulfilled  through  this
institution.

Section 55 of our Constitution gives power to Parliament to consider,  pass,
amend or reject any legislation before the Assembly. To date, we  find  that
our Parliament has passed a number of Bills. Reports are also passed in  big
numbers. And today, I think, is one of the examples of those  days  when  we
pass lots of reports.

Questions  are  also  asked  to  the  executive  on  policy  implementation,
problems that are facing communities, budgets and expenditures, to name  but
a few. The office of the Speaker is also one important entry  to  Parliament
as an institution. In terms of the Rules, Cabinet members must submit  Bills
for classification.

At present, our Parliament has about 25 portfolio committees  which  conduct
oversight and monitor Government departments  and  statutory  bodies.  These
statutory bodies in turn have to report to the  committees.  I  must  submit
that the 25 committees that we currently have look like  a  big  number.  An
example of this is the Portfolio Committee on  Arts,  Culture,  Science  and
Technology, which has to oversee about 48 institutions; and we have only  52
weeks in a year. So, even if they were to take one institution  a  week,  it
would still not work.

We  have  committees  such  as  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice   and
Constitutional Development, which  has  to  see  all  the  Bills  that  come
through, and some not only directed to  justice  matters  but  because  they
have impact on other committees. I think, in the  coming  Parliament,  these
are some of the issues that have to be looked into and changed.

The hours that these committees  spend  on  deliberations  are  also  really
difficult for some members who have health problems  because  they  have  to
spend hours in  committees  and  still  attend  the  House.  Some  of  these
committees that have big workloads do also have to continue with other  work
such as questions  to  hold  the  executive  accountable,  participating  in
debates and also going back to constituencies to do constituency work.

With  all  these  responsibilities,  there  are  of  course  quite   a   few
challenges:  firstly,  the  administrative  support   for   Parliament   and
secondly,  the  technological  challenges.   We   need   to   have   updated
technologies that can help us to be efficient and sufficient in our work.

In meeting these constitutional objectives, we  carry  out  our  mandate  to
South Africa - though we do have these challenges. To  name  but  a  few,  I
must say that looking at the number of  Bills  that  we  have  passed  since
1999, one can realise that this is not really  a  sleeping  kraal,  as  some
people might think, but it  is  a  Parliament  where  members  are  actively
working and also passing the laws that are having a positive impact  on  our
communities.

I must say that though I embrace the concept of Parliament  -  and  we  have
done our best in implementing what is expected of us - I  cannot  forget  to
tell the House that this is a foreign concept to us Africans, especially  if
you look at the history of Africans where  we  inherited  the  systems  that
were used by our colonial powers. For instance, in our case,  we  have  this
Westminster system which, of course, as Africans, we are not familiar  with.
In our systems we know that we use kraals, where there are no opponents  but
a group that discusses the  issues,  and  not  the  people  as  such.  I  do
understand sometimes when people  have  to  oppose  even  where  it  is  not
necessary - it is because of the system that we have adopted.

[According to our custom, when  we  go  to  the  chief's  kraal,  we  go  to
converse. We know that even if you go there, you do not go because you  hate
a person; you go to the chief's kraal because you hate the matter. When  you
arrive at the chief's kraal, you try the matter, you do not try the  person.
That is why, when we are seated in the chief's  kraal,  even  when  you  the
case is very serious, they commence by saying: If a person has  committed  a
crime, that person should not be severely punished, because even if  he  has
made a mistake, the person is human, the person must be  shown  his  or  her
mistakes so that he or she can rectify whatever harm he or she has caused.

In that vein, I request that during the coming year, when we come back  from
the elections, we look into whether this Parliament of  ours  is  performing
the task that it was supposed to accomplish. If we remind one  another  very
well of what the ANC has bound itself to: to improve people's lives.  So  we
cannot improve people's lives if we do not allow them to also  come  to  the
Parliament, to see that this is done at Parliament.

So, let us continue in renewing this Parliament of ours so that it  performs
in the manner that we want it to in order to  complete  its  task.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]]

Adv Z L MADASA: Deputy Speaker, the ACDP believes  that  Parliament  is  not
playing its oversight and accountability role sufficiently, especially  over
the executive.

In terms of Chapter 4, section 42(3),  of  the  Constitution,  the  National
Assembly is elected to represent the people and to ensure government by  the
people under the Constitution. It does this by scrutinising  and  overseeing
executive action. In terms of section 42(3),  Parliament  also  chooses  the
President to ensure that the people govern.

In practice, we have seen this Government,  instead  of  ensuring  oversight
over the organs of the  state,  especially  the  executive,  doing  so  only
against its own members. Parliament has been quick, and even  embarrassingly
open, when it dealt with MPs who  have  misused  travelling  vouchers.  Such
members have been dealt with strictly,  reported  to  the  police,  in  some
instances punished, and some have resigned. Well and good.

But, when allegations have been levelled against some executive members  and
the entire Government,  in  some  instances,  suddenly,  the  executive  has
reversed the roles and exercised oversight  over  Parliament.  Members  have
been intimidated; and party discipline has been invoked. An  impression  has
been  created  that  the  protection  of  the  executive,  when  accused  of
corruption, is part and parcel of the defence of the  democratic  revolution
against reactionary forces and spies. Corruption may be the new  revolution,
but it is not in the interest of the people we were  elected  to  represent,
and it is certainly not the kind of revolution we must defend.
I hope that in the next term of Parliament, especially with  the  advent  of
the Pan-African Parliament, where we must play and are expected  to  play  a
leading role, we shall take our oversight role more seriously. I thank  you.


Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  the  PAC  supports  this  report.  We
believe that Parliament is a large institution which can only  run  properly
with a system of checks and  balances.  Without  this  provision,  we  could
easily degenerate into a disorderly and ineffective House.

Parliament is also a high-profile  institution.  Therefore,  it  is  a  role
model for the nation and other legislative structures in the  provinces  and
local government.

Our experience has not been a very encouraging one, but we should work  hard
to attain the highest ideals of our  democracy:  oversight,  accountability,
transparency and responsiveness. These words echo the  core  values  of  our
democracy.

The PAC supports this report. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  a  democracy,  oversight  and
accountability  are  an  assurance  to  our  citizenry.  The  Government  is
practising its authority and delegated powers  efficiently  and  effectively
in compliance with our national  Constitution  that  makes  laws  such  that
accountability  and  oversight  are  firmly  advocated,  thus  making  us  a
democracy.

Our national Constitution is governing as supreme and has firmly  entrenched
a democratic  system  of  governance.  Through  the  separation  of  powers,
accountability and transparency, we place confidence in our  citizenry  with
the promise that the apartheid regime will never be a reoccurrence in  South
Africa.

However, while the Constitution may have  stipulated  these  provisions  for
governance, it is a mechanism that would put into place aspects  that  would
ensure that a true democracy shall be maintained. Here,  Parliament  allowed
and catered for the transparency and accountability  that  our  Constitution
has made incumbent upon us.  All  parliamentary  activities,  processes  and
encounters are overseen, not only by committees but are accessible  for  the
oversight of the public too. These role-players, in turn, are able  to  make
known our accountability and procedures or our failure to do so.

In whatever respect it may be, the  MF  notes  that  our  accountability  is
first and foremost towards the South African people, who have  voted  us  to
this authority and who deserve an assurance that their interests  are  being
administered most efficiently and effectively.

The MF, however, read the report and seeks that greater  accountability  and
oversight be inculcated to  ensure  greater  success  in  our  parliamentary
process. The subcommittee has made a lot of observations and suggested  that
the MF's request be taken very seriously.

To  succeed  in  having  democracy,  South  Africa  has  to  inculcate   its
constitutional values at 110%, with accountability and oversight playing  an
important role.

The MF supports the report. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M F CASSIM: Madam Deputy Speaker, a member of Parliament or even  someone
in public could  quite  legitimately  ask:  What  is  the  point  of  making
thoroughly good laws - as we make here - or of  approving  adequate  budgets
if the laws are not fully implemented or the budget that has been given  not
fully utilised? It would be, indeed,  futile.  For  this  reason,  portfolio
committees, which have indeed come into their own in the past  10  years  of
democracy, must exercise extensive oversight  over  organs  of  state.  This
must be done on a co-operative basis between the two  Houses  of  Parliament
and according to an overall plan that gives emphasis to the PMFA. This is  a
common request that has been made by all political parties.

Scopa reports, year in and year out, point out the failures  of  departments
or of  entities  in  respect  of,  for  example,  maintaining  proper  asset
registers or appointing  internal  audit  control  measures,  amongst  other
things. After Scopa has reported, as it  will  be  reporting  to  the  House
today, it should be incumbent  upon  portfolio  committees  to  ensure  that
regularity obtains where Scopa has made a finding against  an  entity  or  a
department.

This year, a request was made to the Programme  Committee  of  the  National
Assembly  to  create  opportunities  for  portfolio  committees  to   debate
significant  reports  that  emanate  from  oversight  work   undertaken   by
committees. This is in line  with  practices  in  many  parliaments  of  the
world, where 30 or more fixed opportunities are  created  in  each  calendar
year for committees to report to Parliament.

This year, also, we had some very important oversight reports to the  House.
For example, we had one very important report from the  Portfolio  Committee
on Trade and Industry, which made important  recommendations.  The  question
was: What happens to these  recommendations  after  they  are  made  in  the
House?

I want to thank the hon Chohan-Kota for leading  this  committee.  It  is  a
very important and significant committee, and I hope that its life  will  be
sustained in the new year in order for it to pursue  the  findings  that  it
has made.

We support the report. Thank you.

Mr J H JEFFREY: Madam Deputy Speaker, as some of the previous speakers  have
outlined, this debate comes after a long and thorough process.

The  Constitution  specifies  that  the  National  Assembly   must   provide
mechanisms for oversight and accountability. Consultants were  appointed  to
develop these mechanisms and proposals, their report was  tabled,  discussed
by the Joint  Rules  Committee,  and  a  subcommittee  of  the  Joint  Rules
Committee was appointed to examine and consider the report. After  extensive
deliberations, the committee finally produced their own  report,  which  was
then further adopted by the Joint Rules Committee.

I am a little bit surprised by one of the  previous  speakers,  the  hon  Dr
Woods, who indicated that there was a  lack  of  will  to  take  the  matter
seriously. Dr Woods, unfortunately, did not attend any of  the  meetings  of
that subcommittee and I don't think he attended any of the meetings  of  the
Rules  Committee  when  it  was  deliberating  on  this  report.  Dr  Woods,
unfortunately also, is not in the House at present. He  left  shortly  after
giving his input. I do not know if that is an indication of how  serious  he
really is over the issue of this House and oversight.

What is clear is that although we are trying to refine  the  rules  relating
to oversight, there are a number of mechanisms in place already. I  believe,
unlike Ms Smuts, that Parliament has been exercising its oversight  function
well. Ms Smuts, when she spoke - the hon Ms Smuts  -  made  a  reference  to
Parliament as having been once a powerful organ of state. I'm not sure  what
period she was harking back to. Was it the pre-1994 period, Ms Smuts?  Well,
I think there can be no comparison  between  then  and  now.  There  is  far
greater oversight being performed at the moment.

Committees are going out, looking on the  ground,  seeing  what  departments
are doing. Reports are being tabled and discussed in this House. So I  think
Parliament is performing its function particularly well.

What is clear from the report though, that is the subcommittee's report,  is
that there will always be room for improvement. The recommendations  of  the
subcommittee, as tabled in the ATC, show  the  processes  that  need  to  be
followed to refine and build on  the  procedures  and  mechanisms  that  are
already being followed.

As the legislative workload hopefully decreases in future years,  Parliament
will be able to  spend  more  time  on  oversight  work,  in  examining  how
Government  policies  are  being  implemented,   where   improvements   with
implementation of those policies should be  made,  the  problems  that  have
been experienced with the  implementation  of  legislation,  and  so  on.  A
crucial area is improving the capacity of Parliament and its  committees  in
dealing with oversight  work.  More  resources  need  to  be  given  to  the
committee section to ensure that reports can be properly processed.

Parliament needs to also start  developing  the  capacity  to  get  its  own
answers about what the departments are  doing,  not  necessarily  having  to
rely on information coming from the departments themselves.  I'm  sure  that
Parliament will be able to improve on the oversight work in  committees  and
in  the  interaction  with  departments,  both  here  in  the  precincts  of
Parliament and on oversight on the ground,  as  well  as  by  MPs  in  their
constituency work.

I think that is an area which hasn't really been highlighted by  many  other
speakers - that even in our  constituency  work,  we  should  be  performing
oversight. All MPs should be fully  up  to  date  with  how  the  government
departments in their constituencies are functioning and the  progress  being
made in implementation of Government programmes in their constituencies.

As is being stated in the committee's report, the  definition  of  oversight
is quite complex. What is clearly problematic, is that some of  the  members
of this House, some of the sections  of  the  media  or  even  some  of  the
sections of the public, see oversight as a concept that  indicates  inherent
hostility between Parliament and the executive.

Oversight is equated with a watchdog role and watchdogs,  as  we  all  know,
are there to watch out for bad people, for trespassers,  for  burglars,  and
then to sound the alarm  or  to  bite  them,  or  both.  In  terms  of  this
definition, oversight  can  best  be  performed  or  probably  can  only  be
performed by the opposition. Maybe the proponents of this  understanding  of
oversight  are  too  fixated  with  the  Westminster  two-party  system   of
government, which my hon colleague had indicated we do not have here.

If this model was to be followed, that its only really the  opposition  that
can perform oversight, then shouldn't we be  amending  our  Constitution  so
that there is a certain minimum number of opposition members  so  that  they
can perform oversight properly? Because currently, if  the  electorate  does
not like the opposition, and they are small  in  number,  can  they  perform
oversight properly? [Interjections.]

Welcome, Mr McIntosh. I'm glad that you finally came to listen.

The  Constitution  is  quite  clear:  the  executive   is   accountable   to
Parliament, not to the  opposition.  And  Parliament,  not  the  opposition,
performs oversight over the executive. This is  because  the  executive  and
Parliament are accountable to the people who elected it.  So  accountability
is to the people and the  oversight  that  Parliament  performs  is  on  the
people's behalf. A very large number of people - hon  Mr  McIntosh  -  voted
for the ANC, far more than those who voted for the then DP.

Government is as accountable to the ANC voters as it is to  the  DP  voters,
and in fact more so because there were far more ANC voters  than  DP  or  DA
voters. As an example of the view that  holding  the  executive  accountable
has to be a hostile exercise, I want to refer to the Hogarth column in  last
week's Sunday Times: a section entitled, "Spellbinding stuff  on  Parliament
Live", which mocked the question asked by the hon Langa Zita to  the  Deputy
President  on  how  South  Africa's   involvement   in   peace   initiatives
contributes to improving the lives of South Africans.

The implication of the piece was that  it  was  allegedly  a  ``sweetheart''
question, and that it was inherently boring to the  public  because  it  did
not "grill the Deputy President; put him on the spot;  shake  him  or  roast
him", to use the words. Now, do the ANC voters who elected Mr Zita not  have
the right to have that question answered? Does this kind  of  question  have
to be phrased the way that Mr Jankielsohn - I think  it  was  -  of  the  DA
phrased it in a follow-up, that it would be better to  spend  our  money  on
our own people directly?
This may be the question that the DA supporters are asking, but  it  is  not
the question that the ANC supporters are asking.  Questions  are  not  there
just to put the executive on the spot,  but  also  for  the  people  of  our
country to get information on the things that Government is doing.

Sections of the media, unfortunately, see oversight  as  something  that  is
hostile. In focusing on Parliament, they focus on  certain  members  of  the
opposition who are particularly good at sound  bites  and  project  them  as
good MPs.

Unfortunately, they do not examine the record of  the  same  MPs,  the  fact
that their attendance in Parliament is appalling; that  they  don't  attend,
or even want to be members of portfolio committees.  I  think  most  of  the
parliamentary  journalists  are  aware  that  the  main  oversight  work  of
Parliament gets done in  committees,  but  they  do  not  make  use  of  the
opportunities for engagement with the executive  that  Parliament  provides.
They are not even participating in this debate.

I appeal to these journalists that, instead of trying to create  sensational
stories about what goes on here, to provide the public in their pieces  with
stories of what really goes on in and around Parliament:  the  deliberations
in the committees; the work done by  members  in  their  constituencies;  to
also focus on what  ANC  members  are  saying,  not  just  to  dismiss  them
contemptuously, as  an  article  in  today's  This  Day  did  this  morning,
referring to not just ANC members, but the army  of  backbenchers  who  have
sat in Parliament for five or  more  years,  as  acting  largely  as  voting
fodder. I think that was an indication of the lack of understanding  of  the
role of MPs  and  the  work  that  MPs  are  doing,  particularly  in  their
constituencies.

One of the objects of the ANC is to democratise the  institutions  of  state
and to transform Parliament into a Parliament of the people. I think that  a
lot  of  progress  has  been  made  in  ensuring  that  Parliament  performs
oversight. I think that the ANC took the subcommittee  extremely  seriously,
including the amount of work that particularly our co-chair Ms  Chohan-Khota
put in.
What was unfortunate was the absence of a number of opposition parties.  The
hon Adv Madasa, who also  stood  here  and  complained  about  the  lack  of
oversight and expressed the feeling that Government or  Parliament  was  not
focusing on corruption, never attended a single meeting of  that  committee.
He was so interested in oversight that he did not bother to attend. I  don't
think any member of the ACDP attended at all. It is easy to stand  here  and
say things, but it is another thing actually to  knuckle  down  and  do  the
work.

We need to look at how we can improve, and that we will do. I am  sure  that
with the implementation of the resolutions of the committee,  we  can  build
on the work done by this Parliament and ensure that the oversight work  goes
from strength to strength. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

   CONSIDERATION OF FIFTY-SEVENTH TO NINETY-THIRD AND NINETY-FIFTH TO ONE-
     HUNDRED-AND-EIGHTH REPORTS OF STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS
Mr F BEUKMAN: Thank you, Deputy Speaker and hon members. Thank you  for  the
opportunity to introduce these resolutions to the House  this  afternoon.  I
listened with great interest to the debate on oversight this afternoon,  and
I must say, maybe from practical experience, if anyone in  the  House  wants
to experience oversight and accountability in practice, they are welcome  to
join Scopa. We would appreciate more members.

The resolutions being discussed  this  afternoon  total  more  than  50,  an
indication that Scopa has concentrated  this  year  on  its  core  business,
namely the role of overseeing public finances  from  the  perspective  of  a
parliamentary oversight committee. The resolutions that were  tabled  on  25
and 28 October relate respectively  to  Government  departments  and  public
entities. Due to the limited time I would like  to  refer  first  to  a  few
issues in general.

The introduction of the new method of work by Scopa in 2002 has  enabled  us
to use our limited time more effectively and more productively. Scopa  could
spend  more  time  on  the  problem  departments  or  on  departments  where
financial management is not up to scratch.

Scopa, during 2003, especially focused on public entities.  Public  entities
should be a major focus of the oversight work and role of Parliament. It  is
also stated in terms  of  the  general  findings  of  the  Auditor-General's
general report that the standard of financial management of  certain  public
entities should be drastically improved as a matter of  urgency.  Parliament
cannot allow a situation where institutions that  use  public  money  cannot
account in terms of general  accounting  principles,  or  do  not  have  the
necessary systems in place to ensure that public funds are  spent  in  terms
of the constitutional, legal  or  operational  mandate.  Parliament,  as  an
institution, cannot allow such a situation to prevail.

Major public entities as listed in Schedule 2 of the PFMA and  other  public
entities listed in Schedule 3, those called national  public  entities,  are
not at  liberty  to  do  as  they  like  in  terms  of  financial  reporting
standards. The AG indicated in his General Report  on  Audit  Outcomes  2003
that the information  available  to  Parliament  on  public  entities  is  a
problem. Only 69% of listed public  entities  provided  information  to  the
Auditor-General. If they do not make this  important  information  available
to the AG, he cannot report  to  Parliament.  If  Parliament,  and  in  this
regard  Scopa,  cannot  obtain  the  information,  the  oversight  role   of
Parliament is severely compromised. The information is based on  submissions
of annual reports or financial statements, as required by the PFMA.

The AG indicated that it is important to note that those  entities  excluded
are often the problematic cases. Public entities in  general  should  adhere
to their constitutional and legal obligations.  If  not,  their  boards  and
accounting officers should be reprimanded in the  strongest  possible  terms
by Parliament and the executive.

With regard to national departments, the Auditor-General  indicated  in  his
annual review that eight departments out of the 33 reports  issued  received
qualified opinions, the total  expenditure  being  R140  billion.  Regarding
internal control  problems,  I  think  that  in  all  the  resolutions  this
afternoon, those which are qualified, Scopa focuses on internal  control  as
a major problem issue. Seventy-seven issues were reported in  2001  and  133
issues in 2003, so internal  control  is  still  a  major  problem.  The  AG
indicated that particular attention needs to be drawn to  asset  management,
transfer payments and internal audits.

Departments that received qualifications again - making it three years in  a
row, in 2001, 2002 and 2003 - are the following: Home Affairs,  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, Public Works and Water Affairs.

By hierdie  departemente  is  dit  noodsaaklik  dat  die  uitvoerende  gesag
dringend aandag gee  aan  die  resolusies  van  Skoor,  wat  hulle  dan  ook
resolusies van die Nasionale  Vergadering  maak.  Remediërende  stappe  word
deur Skoor aanbeveel, en dan ook deur die  Parlement.  Tydige  ingryping  is
nodig. Die resolusies wat betrekking het op departemente wat  jaar  na  jaar
gekwalifiseerde oudits kry, is 'n bevestiging dat die wetgewende  gesag  wel
die regte fokus het. Gepaste optrede deur die  uitvoerende  gesag  is  egter
noodsaaklik om die probleemgevalle aan te spreek.

Kwessies wat verskyn het in die resolusies -  en  u  sal  sien,  u  wat  dit
gelees  het  -  asook  dié  in  die   Aankondigings,   Tertafelleggings   en
Komiteeverslae, is die probleemkwessies wat ook  aangespreek  word,  en  wat
ons dan ook aanbeveel. Remediërende stappe is  soos  volg:  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

In these departments it is  essential  that  the  executive  authority  pays
urgent attention to the resolutions of Scopa, which  then  also  makes  them
resolutions of the National Assembly.  Remedial  steps  are  recommended  by
Scopa and then also by Parliament. Timeous intervention  is  necessary.  The
resolutions pertaining to the  departments  that  receive  qualified  audits
year after year are confirmation that the legislative authority does  indeed
have the right focus. Appropriate conduct  by  the  executive  authority  is
essential, however, in order to address problematic issues.

Issues that appeared in the resolutions - and you will  see,  those  of  you
who have read  them  -  as  well  as  in  the  Announcements,  Tablings  and
Committee  reports,  are  the  problematic  issues  which  are  also   being
addressed,  and  that  is  what  we  recommend.  Remedial  steps   are   the
following:]

Potential  reasons  for  increased  reporting  could  be  a  result  of  new
requirements, such as  the  Division  of  Revenue  Act,  improved  financial
reporting requirements in  terms  of  the  phased  PFMA  implementation  and
increased standards in the audit process through a rigorous  quality-control
process. Other examples are  asset  management,  incomplete  and  inaccurate
asset  registers,  transfer  payments  and  the  monitoring  and  review  of
compliance with the Division of Revenue Act.

Die gebrek aan behoorlike finansiële maatreëls in departemente het 'n  impak
op lewering, op die vermoë van  burgers  om  dienste  van  die  owerheid  te
ontvang. Dis daarom noodsaaklik dat alle lede van die Parlement - en dit  is
ook in die vorige debat  na  verwys  -  in  hul  komitees,  portefeuljes  en
dissiplines kennis neem van die departemente wat  in  hul  verslae  jaar  na
jaar nie die basiese elemente van die Wet  op  Openbare  Finansiële  Bestuur
behoorlik implementeer nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows)

[The lack of proper financial measures  in  departments  has  an  impact  on
delivery and on the  ability  of  citizens  to  receive  services  from  the
authorities. It is therefore essential that all members of Parliament -  and
this was also referred to during the previous debate - in their  committees,
portfolios and disciplines take cognisance of those departments which,  year
after year, do not properly implement  the  basic  elements  of  the  Public
Finance Management Act.]

In general, I want to refer  to  some  public  entities  and  also  to  some
national departments with  regard  to  problems  we  have  experienced.  For
example, in the 58th report, on Artscape, Scopa found there  is  uncertainty
regarding Government funding, and also doubt about the entity's  ability  to
continue as a going concern - so that is an issue to be investigated.

Then, regarding the Commission on Gender Equality, there are  weaknesses  in
internal  control,  noncompliance  with  the  rules  and   regulations   and
personnel expenditure being 50% of total expenditure.  These  are  therefore
problem cases.

Regarding the Council on Higher Education, according  to  the  60th  report,
the accounting authority is not audited, there is  no  audit  commission  at
the council and no approval from Treasury to open  new  bank  accounts,  and
they did not deposit funds in excess  of  R1  million  as  required  by  the
Corporation for Public Deposits Act. I want to refer  to  other  departments
quickly, in the limited time available. One example is the Legal Aid  Board,
where we have expressed our commendation  with  regard  to  the  unqualified
audit opinion, but  again  there  are  inefficiencies  in  internal  control
systems  and  procedures,  such  as  undetected   duplicate   payments   and
noncompliance with the VAT Act, the Legal Aid Guide and the PFMA.

Then a public  entity  such  as  the  National  Home  Builders  Registration
Council receives a qualified  opinion  from  the  AG  and  displays  various
weaknesses in internal control and noncompliance with laws and  regulations.
Then, also, with regard to museums in general,  most  of  the  museums  have
problems with internal control and also  with  regard  to  the  handling  of
state subsidies.

In the 69th report we have tabled a very comprehensive resolution on the  SA
Revenue Service. We've also included some issues that  we  have  dealt  with
during our site visit to various subdepartments of Sars, and I just want  to
refer to some issues, especially with regard to internal control:


  However, the committee noted with concern  the  qualified  audit  opinion
  issued by the Auditor-General with respect to  the  administered  revenue
  owing  to  certain  shortcomings  in  internal  control.  The   committee
  therefore decided to examine the following specific  matters  during  its
  hearing with the accounting authority.

We  referred,  for  example,  to  the  assurance  process   and   supporting
documentation  as  important  issues  that  should  be  taken  up.  We  also
indicated in our resolution that  Sars  should  provide  Parliament  with  a
biannual progress  report  with  regard  to  those  matters  raised  by  the
committee.

Then, for example, the SA Sports Commission also has these issues  that  are
really a golden thread through all these qualified  reports  -  nonadherence
to PFMA requirements as the audit committee of the accounting authority  did
not  function  during  the  year,  the  internal  audit  function  was   not
maintained throughout the year as required by  the  PFMA  and  noncompliance
with various laws and regulations.

Then, I think, the problem children of the  public  entities  really  -  the
next Parliament should really deal with  this  in  more  detail  -  are  the
Setas. One good,  or  bad,  example  is  the  financial  statements  of  the
Tourism, Hospitality and Sport Education and Training Authority. This is  an
example that really indicates that we will have to look at the  Setas  as  a
group, although there are, for example, Setas that do very good work.

Byvoorbeeld  die  Seta  vir  die  bankbedryf,  sowel  as  die  een  vir  die
versekeringsbedryf, se finansiële situasie is gesond en die  bestuursituasie
is gesond. Maar ek kan  enkele  voorbeelde  deel  met  lede  van  dié  Raad.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows)

[For example, the Seta for the banking industry, as well as the one for  the
insurance industry, does have a healthy financial situation  and  management
is in a sound condition. But I can share several examples  with  members  of
this House:]

An example relates to the functioning and effectiveness of  the  board.  The
salary package of the CEO at Theta is more than those of  other  Seta  CEOs,
and Scopa made certain recommendations in this  regard,  that  the  Auditor-
General should make a comparison of the salary levels of all the  Setas  and
report  thereon  in  respect  of  the  2002-03  financial  year,   and   the
chairperson of this  board  of  Theta  should  also  provide  Scopa  with  a
framework or guidelines on the restructured salaries.

We also note that the attendance at board meetings  is  poor  and  that  the
board has been reluctant to take action against absentee members - so it  is
really with regard to regulation and control.  Scopa  also  recommends  that
the board continue with its various improvement measures, which may  include
appropriate  action  against  nonattending  members,  that  the   department
indicate how  the  effectiveness  of  boards  of  training  authorities  are
measured, and that the  Auditor-General  pay  particular  attention  to  the
governance aspects of the board during the  next  audit.  These  are  really
some of  the  big  problematic  issues.  Unauthorised  and  irregular  loans
granted are also highlighted in the report as problems that we have to  deal
with.

Then, with regard to the 78th report, on the Department of  Health,  there's
also the reversal of stale warrant vouchers, conditional  grants  and  donor
funding - issues that will have to be improved on during the next  financial
year.

With regard to the reports that were tabled in  October,  I  would  like  to
highlight  the  following  issues.  For  example,  regarding  the   National
Electronic Media Institute, in the 96th report,  the  committee  also  noted
the following issues raised  under  "Emphasis  of  Matter":  A  register  of
interested contacts was not maintained as required by the Companies Act  and
requirements of the PFMA were not fully complied with. So this is  really  a
big problem.

With regard to the 99th report, on the Represented Political Parties'  Fund,
Scopa noted the following: Although the Represented Political Parties'  Fund
meets the definition of a public entity, as defined in the  PMFA,  the  fund
has not yet been listed as a public entity. We also note  the  late  tabling
of previous years' reports to Parliament,  and  reports  of  some  political
parties were not available for reviewing and auditing as per section  66  of
the Public Accountants' and Auditors' Act of 1991.

With regard to another  public  entity,  the  State  Information  Technology
Agency, the 104th report, we note with concern  another  qualified  opinion,
as  well  as  the  following  matters  under  "Emphasis  of   Matter".   The
environment of restructuring in which  Sita  operated  for  the  year  under
review had  a  negative  impact  on  the  control  environment  and  led  to
inefficiencies in internal control systems and procedures. Shares  were  not
issued to the state in terms of the State Information Technology Agency  Act
of 1998. Disclosed issued share capital did not agree  with  the  registered
issued share  capital  of  R1  billion,  as  recorded  in  the  Register  of
Companies. The committee therefore awaits the next  annual  report  and  the
report of the Auditor-General on the  regulatory  orders,  as  well  as  the
follow-up audit on the performance audit.

Dít in breë trekke dan  is  die  verslae  wat  ter  tafel  gelê  word.  Soos
aangedui is daar 'n hele reeks kwessies wat in al die verslae na  vore  kom.
[Those, broadly  speaking,  are  the  reports  that  are  being  tabled.  As
indicated, there are several issues that come to the fore in  all  of  these
reports.]

There are transversal issues that need to be addressed, not  only  by  Scopa
as an oversight committee, but also by portfolio committees as part  of  the
broader oversight function of Parliament. Thank you very much.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy Speaker, I move:


  That the reports be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Reports accordingly adopted.

  CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS - HIV/AIDS
                      WORKSHOP IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY

Inkosi M W HLENGWA:  Hon  Madam  Deputy  Speaker  and  hon  members  of  the
National Assembly, let me start by saying that the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Public Works welcomes the opportunity of considering  this  report  together
with the Parliament of the Republic of South Africa.

The scourge of HIV/Aids is more than a nightmare, across  the  globe.  Today
we are engaging ourselves in a debate on this subject as  a  result  of  the
workshop which was held in Durban, on 25 and 26 November  2002.  I  wish  to
acknowledge our profound gratitude to the participants who made it  possible
that such a report was produced through the inputs from the workshop.

The negative impact of HIV/Aids in the construction industry, which  is  the
third-largest employer in the country, is not something sucked  out  of  our
thumbs. According to Information Services' research - based in Cape  Town  -
South Africa is in the midst of a serious HIV/Aids epidemic.

HIV infection has increased sharply over the past decade  from  almost  zero
to a level where between 4 to 6 million people  are  estimated  to  be  HIV-
positive, that is around 11% of the total population. The official  estimate
for South Africa in 2001 was 4,74 million. The epidemic's toll continues  to
mount even in the midst of the already high HIV prevalence rates.

The number of Aids-related deaths among young adults in  South  Africa,  for
example, is expected to peak in 2010 to 2015, where  it  is  estimated  that
there will be more than  17  times  as  many  deaths  amongst  persons  aged
between 15 and 34 years as there would have been without Aids. Because  Aids
most threatens people of reproductive age from about the age  of  15  to  49
years, its strongest impact has been felt in the workplace  and  within  the
context of the family.

These are realities that reinforced the  decision  that  was  taken  by  the
Portfolio Committee on Public Works in collaboration with the Department  of
Public  Works,  the  Independent  Development  Trust  and  the  Construction
Industry  Development   Board   that   brought   together   decision-makers,
Government  officials,  traditional  leaders,  experts  in  the   field   of
HIV/Aids,   traditional   healers   and   the   SA   construction   industry
stakeholders.

The construction industry is not a unique one, since it remains a  two-sided
coin like all other coins. Its one side is that of offering  employment  and
the other is the separation of families. When there is employment,  families
benefit, but when employees get sick, they go  back  to  their  villages  to
die. It is on this basis  that  we  need  to  put  our  heads  together  and
strategise relief and programmes for families  who  suffer  whilst  some  of
their family members are employed in the  construction  industry  and  after
their death as a result of HIV/Aids.

It is generally agreed that the impact of Aids in the construction  industry
will essentially be the same as the impact of Aids in other industries.  The
infection will thus contribute to  rising  absenteeism,  lower  productivity
for employers and reduction or complete loss  of  income  for  the  affected
worker.

In addition, for an industry that is characterised  by  cyclical  demand,  a
severe blow may be dealt as the economy slumps due to  the  impact  of  Aids
such as absenteeism,  illness  and  the  need  to  train  new  workers.  The
construction industry may also experience problems in  the  future,  if  the
predicted reduction in the demand for low-income housing due to rising Aids-
related deaths occurs.

To us, as the Portfolio Committee on Public Works,  it  was  significant  to
solicit the participation of the institution of traditional leadership,  and
it was represented by the National House of Traditional  Leaders.  In  their
paper, they vowed their dedication to take  a  leading  role  in  the  fight
against Aids in their areas of jurisdiction. They shared with  the  workshop
participants how they had structured the institution for the  fight  against
Aids.

I wish to put on record that six provincial  traditional  leaders'  HIV/Aids
task teams were officially  inaugurated  to  do  their  work  in  the  fight
against Aids without any financial  assistance  or  budget.  They  could  be
doing more but their hands are tied by the lack  of  funds,  and  yet  their
communities are dying of Aids, poverty and unemployment.

It is unfortunate that we are talking about these things  at  this  critical
time - the time of campaigning  for  power  vis-à-vis  addressing  the  real
issues that affect the destitute people of our land.

In conclusion, our  report  has  a  number  of  recommendations  that  will,
definitely, yield good results when implemented. In this report, we  propose
to create a forum of stakeholders where a road map will be crafted  for  the
implementation  and  eradication  of   the   scourge   of   HIV/Aids.   I've
deliberately avoided dealing with the other points  and  recommendations  in
the report, because my colleagues will be coming  to  this  podium  to  deal
with those.

Lo  mbiko  bekungakuhle  ugcine   usungumhlahlandlela   oyosungula   indlela
okuyohanjwa  ngayo,  kuthungathwa  ikhambi  okuyilona  eliyolamlela   isizwe
kulolu bhubhane lwegciwane leNgculazi. Lokhu uHulumeni waseNingizimu  Afrika
akwenze ngokweqiniso, ngaphandle kokunaka ukuthi  labo  abalawulayo  babheke
izinzuzo zombusazwe, noma zobuqembu ngesikhathi isizwe sibhubha ngoba  ukuba
khona kukaHulumeni kuyoqhubeka ngoba kukhona isizwe,  kukhona  abavoti.  Uma
bengasekho abavoti, sibabukela  bebhuqwa  yileli  gciwane,  uHulumeni  uyoba
khona kanjani? Ubani oyovotela lo Hulumeni ukuze abe khona?

Lokhu  ngeke  kwaba  yinto  ebhekene  neNingizimu  Afrika  kuphela.   Abantu
abasemandleni abangaziphatha  ngaleyo  ndlela  noma  ngabe  bakuliphi  izwe,
abayukuphumelela ukuba baqhubeke nobuhulumeni bengasekho abavoti.  Ngakho-ke
lokhu  kubalulekile.  Ngokubuka   kwethu,   njengaleli   komidi,   sikwazile
ukuthinta imikhakha eyehlukene ngaphandle  kokubuka  ukuthi  ubani  uqhamuka
kuphi, kuliphi iqembu nokuthi ubani  usebenza  msebenzi  muni;  senza  ukuba
kuhlanganwe  ukuze  sithungathe,  sithole  ikhambi  ekugcineni  lolulekelela
isizwe siphume kule nkinga. Ngiyathokoza. [Ihlombe.]  (Translation  of  Zulu
paragraphs follows.)

[It will be commendable if this report ends up  as  a  guideline  that  will
create the way to follow in finding a  cure,  which  will  help  the  nation
against this deadly virus - Aids. The Government of  South  Africa  must  do
this truthfully, without looking at the fact that those in authority  expect
political or party political gains while the nation is  dying,  because  the
existence of the government will only continue while there  is  a  nation  -
the voters. When the voters are not there  -  we  are  watching  them  being
killed by this virus - how will there be a government?  Who  will  vote  for
this Government in order for it to exist?

This will not only affect South  Africa.  The  people  in  power  who  could
behave like that, irrespective of the country in which they  are,  will  not
succeed in continuing with governing the country when there are  no  voters.
This is, therefore, important. From our point of view,  as  this  committee,
we were able to consult with different categories  without  looking  at  who
comes from where, from which party and that what kind of work one  does.  We
created a situation where we can work together in  trying  to  find  a  cure
eventually, which will help the nation to escape from this conundrum.  Thank
you. [Applause.]]

Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, the four Ministers that  I
see in the House, the first case of Aids was reported in the  United  States
in 1981. However, the Aids epidemic in Africa started in the late 1970s  and
1980s. The HIV/Aids epidemic has spread widely throughout  the  region,  but
the  hardest  hit  are  South  Africa,  Botswana,  Zimbabwe,   Lesotho   and
Swaziland.

Current  estimates  are  that  Botswana,  the  miracle  of  Africa,  has   a
staggering infection rate of 38,8%.  In  Zimbabwe,  where  the  disease  has
exacerbated the current famine in the country, infection  rates  are  around
33,7%. In South Africa, the economic heart of the region, the  HIV  rate  is
now 25%. Lesotho has an infection rate of 31% and in Swaziland it stands  at
33,4%.

Aware of the catastrophe facing our  country,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Public Works held an HIV/Aids workshop in the construction  industry  during
the latter part of last year. What emerged from this workshop  is  that  the
construction industry is the third-largest employer in  South  Africa.  Like
many in the building or infrastructure sector, the industry  employs  people
between the ages of 18 and 35 years. Most  of  the  construction  labour  is
drawn from the rural areas, and the nature of  the  jobs  also  tend  to  be
short-term, thus rendering  the  workforce  a  highly  mobile  group.  As  a
consequence the industry separates families for long times.

Research  commissioned  by  the  Department  of  Public  Works   and   other
construction stakeholders indicates that the construction industry  has  the
third-highest incidence of HIV/Aids per economic  centre  in  South  Africa.
The impact of HIV/Aids within the industry manifests primarily in  the  form
of high rates of absenteeism and the depletion of  skills  as  a  result  of
which the high incidence of  HIV/Aids  hinders  the  industry's  ability  to
produce work in a timely manner. In a  secondary  fashion  this  impacts  on
poverty, unemployment, education and other factors.

To combat this devastating epidemic, some very  practical  suggestions  were
made at this workshop. The first was that  HIV/Aids  awareness  should  take
place on site. Because of the mobility of the individuals who work  in  this
industry, the best place to contact and educate them would be on  site.  The
second suggestion was that  provision  of  occupational  and  family  health
care, including free HIV  testing  services,  should  be  rendered  on  site
again. In addition, the family of the infected employee should  be  provided
with a counselling and support system.

The third  and  very  important  suggestion  was  that  recruitment  of  the
workforce should be from the local  population  rather  than  using  migrant
labour such as in the mining industry, where 70% of  workers  are  migratory
workers. If the families live  where  the  people  work,  it  is  easier  to
contact them and make educational progress with such communities.  Fourthly,
the recruiting of traditional leaders  and  healers  into  the  campaign  is
crucial. As previously mentioned, a lot of these workers emerge  from  rural
areas and when they're ill they go back to their homelands. Therefore it  is
necessary for traditional leaders to be involved in this  whole  process  of
education and treatment.

The United Nations has characterised HIV/Aids  in  Africa  as  the  greatest
single threat to Africa's social and economic development. The  construction
industry, like the police service, teachers, the armed  forces,  social  and
health workers, and most others, have to rise  to  the  challenge  we  as  a
country and people will face in the days ahead. Therefore we're quite  happy
that this workshop took place and enlightened the people  in  the  different
spheres of our economic activity to the dangers and  the  solutions  to  the
problems we face with this epidemic. Thank you.
Mr S E OPPERMAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the theme of  my  short  presentation
this afternoon is "An Industry Under Siege".

In Afrikaans is dit "'n Industrie Onder Beleg".

Alhoewel die statistiek omtrent ongelukke op Suid-Afrikaanse paaie  skokkend
is,  en  krisisvergaderings  gehou  en  strategieë  ontwikkel  word  om  die
sterftes op ons paaie te verminder, is die slagting op ons  paaie  niks  nie
in vergelyking met die aantal mense wat jaarliks  aan  vigsverwante  siektes
sterf. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In Afrikaans it is "'n Industrie onder beleg".

Although  statistics  regarding  accidents  on  South  African   roads   are
shocking, and crisis meetings are being held  and  strategies  developed  to
decrease the number of deaths on our roads, the carnage on our  roads  bears
no comparison to the number of people dying  every  year  from  Aids-related
diseases.]

South Africa has surpassed India as the country with the highest  number  of
people infected with HIV in the world. Five million  people  are  living  in
our country with the disease. Six hundred  thousand,  according  to  UNAids,
died during 2002.

Dit kan vergelyk word met 80 18-sitplek-taxi's wat elke dag  van  die  jaar,
365 dae, in kop-aan-kop-botsings betrokke is waarin al die  passasiers  saam
met die bestuurder sterf. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This can be compared to 80 18-seater taxis involved  every  single  day  of
the year, 365 days, in head-on collisions, in which all the passengers,  the
driver included, die.]

No wonder Liam Hook, one of the directors of UNAids, referred to the  crisis
as an armageddon, and this is only the second  wave  of  the  pandemic.  The
first wave was the infection, silent and  virtually  unnoticed.  The  second
wave refers to the deaths because of Aids-related illnesses. The  third  and
most devastating wave refers to the economic, political  and  social  impact
that  has  the  potential   to   decimate   economies,   with   far-reaching
implications for all of us.

Hierdie golf, die derde golf,  is  besig  om  oor  Suider-Afrika  te  breek.
Daarom, alhoewel die onderwerp van vigs tot vervelens toe  in  hierdie  Huis
gedebatteer is, durf niemand die  impak  van  die  pandemie  onderskat  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This wave, the third wave, is at present  breaking  over  Southern  Africa.
For this reason no-one dares to underestimate the impact  of  the  pandemic,
although the subject of Aids has been debated ad nauseam in this House.]

Everyone in South Africa will be  infected  or  affected  by  the  waves  of
infection, mortality and devastation. There will be no place  to  hide.  The
fact that we had representatives from the  National  Youth  Commission,  the
Department of Social Development, the Chamber of  Mines,  the  Institute  of
Security Studies, the Medical Research Council,  the  JOB  Construction  and
Mining,  the  Traditional  Healers'  Association,  the  National  House   of
Traditional Leaders, the Department of Public  Works  and  the  Construction
Industry Development Board at the workshop, with the hon Minister of  Public
Works, Stella Sigcau, responsible for the official  opening  to  assess  the
impact of HIV/Aids in the construction industry  is  an  indication  of  the
seriousness with which we view the unfolding crisis.

The Construction Industry Development Board was  established  by  Parliament
to stimulate growth, reform and improvement  of  the  construction  industry
and to  enhance  the  construction  industry's  role  in  the  socioeconomic
development of the country. Because one of their key responsibilities is  to
drive implementation of  the  strategies  for  the  improvement  within  the
industry, the CIDB has developed a specification  which  aims  to  influence
the way clients engage contractors by  making  HIV/Aids  awareness  on  site
part of the total deliverables to the client.  HIV/Aids  awareness  on  site
will be an item that the contractor can price and must deliver  as  part  of
the entire project. Monitoring and evaluation will not be easy, because  the
industry is complex and fragmented, with many different role-players.

We believe, however, that as we  join  hands  with  all  these  stakeholders
inside and outside the construction industry in sharing  the  resources  and
expertise, and with a commitment to the challenge  before  us,  we  will  be
able to turn the tide. We thank you.

Dr M S MOGOBA: Madam Deputy Speaker, HIV/Aids  is  a  horrific  threat,  not
only to the building and construction industry, but to the whole nation;  to
this Parliament, the cause of our  land,  the  churches  and  the  corporate
world as a whole. Indeed we should work hard to  try  and  come  up  with  a
solution to this high loss of life.

It is the responsibility of companies which make money out of  the  industry
to work hard to save lives and to reaffirm family life and ensure  that  the
workers do live with their families while they work. One way of winning  the
war against HIV/Aids is to increase education, because knowledge  is  power.
We also need to network and involve  employers,  workers,  business  houses,
the National House of  Traditional  Leaders,  the  traditional  healers  and
everybody.

I want to say that whilst I'm  impressed  with  the  participation  at  this
workshop, I'm surprised that there is such a striking omission of  religious
communities; the churches and the mosques.  I  believe  that  the  religious
bodies are the largest NGO in the  land;  in  fact,  they  are  the  largest
political party, and what is more, they meet their people twice  a  week  to
preach to them and teach them, and if  we  talk  about  attitudinal  change,
this is the institution that we should not leave out when we want  to  bring
about change. With this comment I want to say that the PAC will support  the
report of this workshop.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. We know  what  a  horrific
impact Aids has had and continues to have on our  economy.  It  is  dreadful
that it has run its course into the third-largest employer in South  Africa,
namely the construction industry.

The MF firmly supports the intensification of  HIV/Aids  awareness  in  this
industry, noting that the industry comprises  persons  from  diverse  social
and economic backgrounds. Our approach to the matter  has  to  be  flexible.
The MF feels that the recruitment of local labour will not only curtail  the
problem of HIV/Aids,  but  will  hold  families  together,  to  prevent  the
separation that often results in such serious consequences that they  hinder
our social development.

The involvement of traditional leaders in the fight  against  HIV/Aids  will
be beneficial in terms of their auspicious influence  and  position  in  the
communities. The integration of traditional healers  into  the  conventional
health  care  system  will  also  assist  in  the  reduction   of   HIV/Aids
infections. Further, disclosure of the reality of their HIV/Aids status  may
awaken them to the reality of this crisis and hopefully  increase  awareness
and concern.

The MF supports the efforts to curtail HIV/Aids  and  the  report.  I  thank
you, Madam Speaker.

Mr M M CHIKANE: Madam Deputy Speaker, the ANC aligns itself with the  report
as presented. We also want  to  reiterate  the  words  of  our  chairperson,
Inkosi Hlengwa, that indeed the question of  HIV/Aids  is  quite  a  serious
problem for all of us.

The joint approach by both parties, the IFP and the  ANC,  has  really  been
commendable. We hope that the new alliance is not going to change  this.  We
had common problems; we had common approaches; and this was definitely  very
positive.

We, however, are concerned that some of those  who  were  part  of  the  new
alliance had at some stage taken  this  to  be  a  political  question  -  a
football they could play around with, with which they  could  try  to  score
points. We hope this shall not now influence the  position  of  the  IFP  on
this matter.
You would remember that not so long ago the ANC was accused,  especially  by
people from the DA, of not being serious about the  question  of  Aids.  Our
Government was supposed to be  steamrollered  into  ordering  antiretroviral
drugs from unknown sources outside our country.  We  resisted  that.  Today,
now that we have acquired the skills to develop this drug, we  realise  that
their campaign has since died.

We are not unaware that the campaign has been  stopped,  because  those  who
had been pushing this campaign had other ideas about how  we  should  handle
problems. Why, now that  we  have  discovered  the  drug,  is  the  campaign
suddenly dead? It would be the same people  who  today  have  taken  on  the
question of workers. Over  the  years,  Cosatu  was  maligned  as  being  an
organisation of communists who had no commitment to the  serious  cause  and
plight of our workers. We hope that this shall not influence the  perception
of the IFP, an organisation with which we have built  a  very  good  working
relationship and common approach to problems.
We, however, Inkosi, disagree with you when you  say  that  the  traditional
leaders were not given support. Indeed, we had constraints, as the  ANC  and
as Government, in certain areas. You would remember when we started the  RDP
programme, and of course I  should  not  repeat  that  other  people  didn't
support it. But I know that the IFP was with us - they  supported  the  RDP.
We created  hospitals,  assets  and  clinics  in  rural  areas,  which  were
supposed to have helped us to deal with such matters.  Unfortunately,  owing
to budget constraints, some of them were not  operational  when  we  visited
them. However, we believe that we should be able to address  this  situation
over time and that health facilities will be able to  reach  our  people  in
rural areas.

I do not agree with the bishop that church leaders  are  excluded.  However,
perhaps we didn't mention them in our report.  We  know  that  they  play  a
central role in this matter. That they are a  political  party,  we  do  not
know - we will ask them next time we meet. We  thought  their  task  was  to
save our souls and make sure that we do not commit sins.
We also do not agree with  the  DA  assertion  that  South  Africa  has  the
highest rate of infection, because that is not  true.  It  is  actually  not
true. If you start with the wrong premise, you are going to  get  the  wrong
answer, and, I think, that is the problem. They started with  that  first  -
that we have the highest rate - and we believe that is not true. It is  true
that Aids is a problem, but let's not say that we have the highest rate.

Dr Jassat just spoke and  compared  statistics  from  various  countries  in
Southern Africa. He said that the infection rate in South Africa  was  about
25%. In other countries the rate is even higher than that, not that that  is
not a problem.

We, in the ANC, believe that this question  that  is  maintained  cannot  be
solved by quick-fix political  agendas.  It  can  be  fixed  by  all  of  us
collectively  taking  a  position  that   can   deal   with   this   problem
comprehensively. It does not help to rush to the newspapers and condemn  the
Minister of Health for opportunistic reasons - call her  names  -  but  once
she makes progress, then suddenly be silent. We believe  that  the  question
of Aids affects families,  it  demoralises  people,  it  destroys  families.
Therefore, it must be treated as a serious matter and treated urgently  with
all the resources possible. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I  move  that  the
report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

                           (Consideration of Bill)

There was no debate.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I  move  that  the

Motion agreed to.

Bill accordingly agreed to.

                      PETITION OF ROYAL SWAZI FAMILIES

     (Consideration of Report of Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs)

There was no debate.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I  move  that  the
report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Can I take the Deputy Chief Whip back to  the
57th Order of the day? It was actually a Bill that  we  were  referring  to,
not a report. Would the Deputy Chief Whip like to move for the  adoption  of
the Bill?

The DEPUTY CHIEF  WHIP  OF  THE  MAJORITY  PARTY:  Chairperson,  in  fact  I
understood that it was a Bill.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I have to put the question again.  Are  there
any objections? No objections. Agreed to.

    ALLEGATIONS REGARDING PURCHASE OF GUESTHOUSE BY CIVILIAN INTELLIGENCE
                                  SERVICES

    (Consideration of Report of Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Mr Gibson, I understand you have  been  asked
to speak on this matter.

Declarations of vote:

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE OPPOSITION: Chairperson, I rise to make a  declaration
on this item, and to tell you and hon  members  that  the  DA  rejects  this
report. It was incomplete and it looked at the question of  the  impropriety
or otherwise of the purchase, and that was the purchase  of  a  multimillion
rand guesthouse on the coast.

While it's a relief to learn that  the  acquisition  was  not  improper,  in
other words, there was nothing illegal or corrupt about the  purchase,  it's
most disappointing to me and to  my  party  that  the  committee  didn't  go
further and do its job properly. What it should have done  was  to  look  at
whether the purchase of a multimillion-rand seaside  cottage  was  justified
or not justified. In other words, they should have looked at the  priorities
of the department.

At  a  time  when  there  is  not  sufficient  money  available  for   crime
intelligence, this department sees fit to  waste  the  taxpayers'  money  on
unnecessary luxuries. They also saw fit to attack me. They're welcome to  do
that - I've been attacked by lots of people in my time.

We, on this  side  of  the  House,  will  go  on  pointing  out  unnecessary
luxuries,  unnecessary  waste  and  unnecessary  secrecy  where  they  start
pretending that all these things are all matters of national  security,  and
they're not. That committee will go ahead and do so and the department  will
do so without the assistance of the DA in this instance. [Interjections.]

Dr S C CWELE: Chairperson, it is very unfortunate for the Chief Whip of  the
Largest Minority Party to say that now, because the committee was  unanimous
in adopting this report. It was also unanimously agreed not  to  debate  the
report, and that's the reason we do not  have  a  speakers'  list.  All  the
parties did agree that we should not debate the matter and that we  take  it
to Parliament, and we confirmed that decision even today. I  confirmed  that
even a few minutes ago before Mr Gibson spoke. So I'm not very sure  whether
his point of view is shared by his party.

But, I just want to correct a few things. To come  here  and  say  that  the
committee didn't do its work - I hope Mr Gibson did  read  the  report  very
carefully - on the  basis  of  the  information  before  the  committee  ...
[Interjections.] we didn't say that we've closed the matter. We did say,  at
the conclusion of the report, that if there is anything contrary to what  we
have in our investigation as a committee, and if the  Auditor-General  finds
otherwise, we'll open the matter. So it is not correct that  there  was  any
superficiality on the matter.

On the issue of whether it was necessary to have such  a  facility,  if  you
check very well on page two of that report, it  states  the  reason  it  was
necessary for this  democratic  Government  to  have  such  a  facility.  Mr
Gibson, I'll provide you with some of the reasons the  committee  felt  that
it was necessary to have this facility.

The intelligence community is not just about spying on people;  it  plays  a
critical role in  negotiations.  It  plays  a  critical  role  in  resolving
conflicts either amongst you as parties or among South African citizens,  or
at international level. Some of those meetings  cannot  be  held  in  public
places such as hotels, because you would really interfere  with  the  rights
of the people who stay at those hotels. If you put up systems  that  disrupt
the process of communication, then you  would  be  limiting  the  rights  of
those citizens  who  go  to  those  hotels  as  guests  and  not  for  those
discussions. That is just but one of the reasons.

Secondly, South Africa is increasingly playing  an  important  role  in  the
negotiations for peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa.  Bringing  such
people over here and accommodating them in a hotel in Cape Town - Cape  Town
is the seat of Parliament, if I may  just  remind  the  Chief  Whip  of  the
Largest Minority Party - wouldn't be appropriate.

Furthermore, for the Chief Whip of the Largest Minority Party  to  say  that
as a committee we attacked him is  incorrect.  Our  report  just  says  that
Parliament must  exercise  caution,  particularly  when  dealing  with  this
matter. We are not saying that we shouldn't deal with it. I  move  that  the
House accept the report and reject what Mr  Gibson  is  saying.  Thank  you.
[Time expired.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, we move  that  the
report be adopted.

Motion agreed to (Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Report accordingly adopted.

The House adjourned at 16:55.

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    The Speaker of the  National  Assembly  and  the  Chairperson  of  the
     National Council of Provinces as co-chairpersons present the Report  of
     the  Joint  Rules  Committee,  dated   17   November   2003,   on   the
     Implementation of the Recommendations  of  the  Joint  Subcommittee  on
     Oversight and Accountability, as follows:

National Assembly:

1.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security on the  Anti-
     Terrorism Bill [B 12 - 2003] (National Assembly -  sec  75),  dated  13
     November 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security,  having  considered
         the subject of the Anti-Terrorism Bill  [B  12  -  2003]  (National
         Assembly - sec 75), referred to it  and  classified  by  the  Joint
         Tagging Mechanism as a section 75 Bill, and having  conferred  with
         the Portfolio Committees on Finance, Foreign Affairs,  Justice  and
         Constitutional Development and  the  Joint  Standing  Committee  on
         Intelligence, presents the  Protection of Constitutional  Democracy
         Against Terrorist and Related Activities Bill [B 12B - 2003].


         The Committee further recommends that the South African Law  Reform
         Commission  be  requested  to  investigate  the  possibility  of  a
         specific civil action in respect of consequential  damages  arising
         from  hoaxes  (including  the  possibility  of  punitive   damages)
         separate from the expenses incurred by the  security  services,  to
         deal with such hoaxes. The civil action is intended to be  separate
         from the reimbursement order which may be made by a Court  after  a
         conviction in respect of the offence  relating  to  hoaxes  (Clause
         18(2)  of  the  Protection  of  Constitutional  Democracy   Against
         Terrorist and Related Activities Bill). A provision to this  effect
         in our law is, for  example,  in  respect  of  riot  damage,  which
         occurs as a result of gatherings and  demonstrations  (see  section
         11 of the Regulation of  Gatherings  Act,  1993  (Act  No.  205  of
         1993)).


     Report to be considered.

2.     Report  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on   Communications   on   the
     Telecommunications Amendment Bill [B 65 - 2003]  (National  Assembly  -
     sec 75), dated 14 November 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Communications,  having  considered  the
         subject of the Telecommunications Amendment  Bill  [B  65  -  2003]
         (National Assembly - sec 75), referred to it and classified by  the
         Joint Tagging Mechanism as a section  75  Bill,  reports  the  Bill
         with amendments [B 65A - 2003].

3.    Report of the Portfolio Committee on Communications on Appointment  of
     SABC Board, dated 14 November 2003:


         The Portfolio Committee on Communications,  having  considered  and
         examined the matter of the  appointment  of  the  12  non-executive
         members of the Board of the SABC, referred to it for  consideration
         and report on 30 June 2003, reports as follows:


              The Committee invited  the  public  to  nominate  persons  for
              consideration  and  recommendation  to   the   President   for
              appointment on the Board by means  of  advertisements  in  the
              print media. Responses were received from 138 individuals.


              Twenty-eight candidates were shortlisted on  21  August  2003,
              viz:


                Berger, G; Buys, F; Claassen, G; Cooper, S; Eloff, T; Funde,
                S E; Gasa, N; Gilwald, A; Gosa, N;  Kekana,  N  N;  Kok,  F;
                Lagadien, F; Louw, R; Luyt, M; Maralack,  A;  Mazwai,  E  T;
                Mbeki, A; Mkhonza,  K;  Minnie,  J;  Moholi,  P;  Msomi,  C;
                Niehaus, C; Qunta, C; Rowland, W; Swartz, D; Teer-Tomaselli,
                R; Trikamjee, A; Van Wyk, A H.


              Of the above 28 nominees, three, Messrs  Maralack,  Eloff  and
              Buys, withdrew from the process. On 23 September, Mr  Maralack
              indicated  that  the  circumstances  that  had  led   to   his
              withdrawal had changed and that he would  therefore  be  in  a
              position to be interviewed. A legal opinion  was  sought,  and
              the matter was put before the Committee,  upon  which  it  was
              resolved that he be interviewed.


              Subsequently, Mr Kekana withdrew from the process.


              The Committee spent 27 hours interviewing the 26 candidates in
              open meetings in Parliament on 9, 10, 16, 17 and 23  September
              and on 14 November 2003.


              The  Committee  accordingly  recommends  that  the  House,  in
              accordance with section 13 of the Broadcasting Act, (Act No. 4
              of 1999), make a recommendation  to  the  President  that  the
              following candidates be appointed as non-executive members  of
              the SABC Board:


                Funde, S E
                Gilwald, A
                Gosa, N
                Lagadien, F
                Maralack, A
                Mazwai, E T
                Mbeki, A
                Mkhonza, K
                Msomi, C
                Qunta, C
                Swartz, D
                Trikamjee, A


     Recommendations to be considered.

4.     Report  of  the   Portfolio   Committee   on   Public   Service   and
     Administration  on  the  Filling  of  Vacancies   in   Public   Service
     Commission, dated 13 November 2003:


         The Portfolio  Committee  on  Public  Service  and  Administration,
         having noted the correspondence from the Presidency to the  Speaker
         regarding  the  filling  of  vacancies  in   the   Public   Service
         Commission, referred to it, reports as follows:


              The Committee has gone through a process  of  advertising  and
              shortlisting candidates  with  a  view  to  filling  the  five
              positions in the Public Service Commission.


              The Committee has satisfied itself that due consideration  was
              given to all the applicants in a fair  and  equitable  manner,
              taking into cognisance  the  requirements  stipulated  in  the
              advertisement  and  the  broad  strategic  objective  of   the
              democratic government of ensuring fairness.


              Furthermore,  we  have  ensured   that   representativity   is
              considered, notwithstanding the  fact  that  this  requirement
              should not be looked at mechanically, and we have  arrived  at
              the conclusion that the whole  process  was  not  in  any  way
              prejudicial or flawed. The Committee  submits  that  all  nine
              applicants were of the required specifications.


              Having concluded the  interviews,  the  following  had  to  be
              considered:


              (a) Continuity.


              (b) Gender balance.


              (c) Racial balance.


              (d) Mixing experience with new blood.


              (e) Skills and expertise.


              The Committee therefore recommends the  following  persons  to
              fill the respective vacancies in the Public Service Commission
              (endorsed by all political parties taking part in the process)
              for approval by the House:
              1.  Mrs Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko.


              2.  Mrs Koko Mokgalong.


              3.  Mr  John  Henry  Ernstzen  (Existing  Commissioner),  with
                  effect from 1 January 2004.


              4.  Dr E G Bain (Existing Commissioner), with  effect  from  1
                  January 2004.


              5.  Prof S S Sangweni (Existing  Commissioner),  with   effect
                  from 1 July 2004.
