                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. At the next sitting of  the
House I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes attempts by Israel to be a referee and a player, with  specific
       reference to its attempts to choose who it wants  to  negotiate  with
       and to exclude Chairman Yasser Arafat  from  the  Middle  East  peace
       talks;


  (2) disapproves of attempts by  Israel  to  assassinate  Chairman  Yasser
       Arafat as reported on television news yesterday;


  (3) notes the overwhelming support by Palestinians for Chairman Arafat;


  (4) believes that peace in the Middle East cannot be  achieved  with  the
       bully-boy tactics of Israel; and finally,


  (5) calls upon Israel to stop its attempts to sideline Chairman Arafat as
       it will not succeed.

Mr K D S DURR: Chairman, I shall move at the next sitting of the House:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the most recent violation of press freedom  in  Zimbabwe,  with
       the  closure  by  the  Zimbabwean  police  and  courts  of  the  only
       independent newspaper that was left in that country, namely The Daily
       News;


  (2) notes that this flies in the face of recent assurances given, also to
       South Africa, on the subject of freedom of expression in Zimbabwe;


  (3) notes that the ageing tyrant  Robert  Mugabe's  rule  has  made  life
       unbearable for ordinary  people,  and  that  the  state  is  becoming
       dysfunctional with rogue state characteristics, where the  government
       has become a predator upon its own people;


  (4) calls upon the Government, our Government,  to  take  whatever  steps
       that would be wise and  necessary  to  end  this  nightmare  for  the
       Zimbabwean people, including encouraging  Zimbabwe  to  move  towards
       arranging a full and fair, transparent general election  as  soon  as
       possible, with possible interparty co-operation thereafter;


  (5) notes that it was the action of the South African Government  at  the
       time that forced the Rhodesian Front to the  negotiating  table,  and
       that the current  South  African  Government  should  again  use  its
       leverage for change in that country.

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Thank you, Deputy Chair. At the next sitting I shall move:


  That the House -


  (1) notes the desperate attempts by the DA to discredit at all costs  the
       ANC among South African citizens, the recent case purporting a racial
       slur  in  the  Western  Cape,  as  reported  in  the  Cape  Times  of
       16 September 2003;


  (2) notes that the DA referred the matter of alleged racism to the  Human
       Rights Commission;


  (3) further notes that the person who is supposedly the victim of such an
       alleged racial slur did not see anything peculiar about the  question
       asked by Mr Dugmore during a radio interview;


  (4) further notes that this is not the first time that the  DA  has  used
       institutions that support democracy;


  (5) believes that the DA will not succeed in its  attempts  to  discredit
       the ANC;


  (6) believes that the use of these political institutions  for  political
       opportunism is a waste of time and taxpayers' resources, which  could
       have been used for more important matters affecting the country;  and
       lastly,


  (7) calls upon the DA  to  stop  using  our  institutions  which  support
       democracy for their selfish political opportunism.

Me E C GOUWS: Voorsitter, hiermee gee ek  kennis  dat  ek  by  die  volgende
sitting van die Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1)  kennis  neem  van  die  feit  dat  die  NNP  in  die  Bloemfonteinse
       tussenverkiesing   gedaal   het   tot   die   vlak    van    blatante
       leuenverspreiding om sodoende hul sinkende skip te probeer red;


  (2) daarop ag slaan dat die NNP deur middel van plakkate skokkende leuens
       oor die doodstraf verkondig het, maar die waarheid  is  dat  die  NP-
       regering in 1990 self die doodstraf afgeskaf het - hierdie onwaarhede
       is dus op dramatiese wyse deur middel  van  swart  plakkate  met  wit
       bewoording uitgebasuin;


  (3)  die  onderwerpe  bevraagteken  in   die   lig   van   'n   plaaslike
       raadsverkiesing;


  (4) verder kennis neem van die feit dat die Hoë Hof die NNP gelas het  om
       die plakkate te verwyder, wat hulle gedoen het, maar in  weerwil  van
       die hofbevel dit weer in die strate vertoon het;


  (5) vertrou dat die NNP van minagting van die hof aangekla sal word; en


  (6) sy teleurstelling uitspreek oor hierdie integriteitlose  optrede  van
       die NNP.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next  sitting  of  the
Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes the fact that in the Bloemfontein by-election the NNP  sank  to
       the level of blatantly spreading lies in an attempt to  try  to  save
       their sinking ship;


  (2) notes that the NNP told shocking lies about the death penalty by  way
       of posters, but the truth is that the NP government itself  abolished
       the death penalty in 1990 - these untruths were  therefore  broadcast
       in dramatic fashion by way of black posters with white lettering;


  (3) questions these topics in the light of a local council election;


  (4) further notes the fact that the High Court ordered the NNP to  remove
       the posters, which they did, but, notwithstanding  the  court  order,
       they displayed them on the streets again;


  (5) trusts that the NNP will be charged with contempt of court; and


  (6) expresses its disappointment in this  behaviour  by  the  NNP,  which
       lacked integrity.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Order!  Hon
member, there is something wrong with the microphone.

               DISTORTION OF MARKET FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the huge amounts of subsidies paid  to  farmers  in  Europe  and
           America have  seriously  distorted  the  competitive  market  of
           agricultural products originating from developing countries  and
           especially Africa and Asia;


       (b)  the billions of dollars and euros spent by America  and  Europe,
           respectively,   to   subsidise   their   farmers   results    in
           unrealistically  bringing  down  the  prices   of   agricultural
           products from developing countries;


       (c)  this creates an unfair competitive  environment,  which  favours
           farmers of Europe and America  and  creates  enormous  financial
           burdens on developing countries; and


       (d)  this also retards economic growth;


  (2) therefore expresses its disappointment at the failure  of  the  World
       Trade Organisation to reach an agreement at Cancun to  eradicate  the
       payment of subsidies to farmers among member states of Europe and the
       United States of America;
  (3) urges the developed countries to show greater regard  and  commitment
       to the plight of farmers in developing countries; and


  (4) is of the view that their conduct is inconsistent with the spirit  of
       free trade and enterprise in our global village.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  There  is  something
wrong  with  the  microphones.  Can  somebody  please  get  the  microphones
working.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Deputy Chair. I move without notice:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  SA's Hestrie Cloete is the No 1 woman athlete in the world after
           being declared Woman Athlete of the Year in Monte  Carlo  during
           the weekend;


       (b)  the slim high-jumper's win in Monte Carlo at the World Athletics
           Final was preceded by equally brilliant  performances  in  Paris
           and Brussels;


       (c)  Maria Mutola of  Mozambique  had  won  the  World's  prestigious
           women's 800m event three years in succession, thus scoring a hat-
           trick of her own; and


       (d)  these two women of Africa are on top of the world and that their
           achievements are a source of inspiration to all Africans; and


  (2) congratulates these two super athletes and calls upon the  nation  to
       celebrate this joyous event.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Hon Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) expresses its deep shock and sorrow at the sudden passing away of the
       Queen Mother, Her Majesty Mamohato, Bereng  Seeiso,  on  6  September
       2003 in her Queendom of Lesotho;


  (2) notes that especially the people of the Free  State  have  felt  this
       shock and loss deeply, remembering her devotion  to  the  Free  State
       Legislature where she had been received enthusiastically;


  (3) appreciates that the majority of her subjects work and  live  in  the
       Free State;


  (4) notes that the Free State treasures the invaluable contributions that
       have been and still are being made to that province by  her  subjects
       with their labour and their lives on farms, in gold and diamond mines
       and in the trade and industry of the Free State;


  (5) thanks God for her leadership, support of education, steadfast faith,
       humour and neighbourliness and the down-to-earth  relations  she  had
       with all people;


  (6) conveys its sympathy to the Basotho people on their  bereavement  and
       extends its sincere condolences to His Majesty the  King,  the  royal
       family and all who have been touched by her life and witness; and


  (7) offers its prayers and solidarity as she is laid to rest next to  her
       beloved daughter.

    A REVIEW OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND
  STATUS OF WOMEN OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS AND OF CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD
                    TO PUSH BACK THE FRONTIERS OF POVERTY

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson and  hon  members,  we  can
never be grateful enough that, not only  one  but  both  of  the  Houses  of
Parliament are holding this important debate on the  review  of  improvement
in the quality of life of women during the first decade  of  our  democracy.
Only a few years ago it would  have  been  unheard  of  for  this  House  to
concern itself with the plight of women, particularly those who are  at  the
bottom rung of our social ladder and who happen to constitute  the  majority
of this sector of our society.

I must say from the beginning, therefore,  that  for  us  as  the  ANC  this
debate cannot be seen as just a platform for boasting and  high  praises  or
for gains already registered.  Although  these  should  be  highlighted  the
debate should also serve to provide an honest assessment of how far we  have
gone in addressing women's emancipation, as well as  to  consider  practical
steps  that  need  to  be  taken  in  overcoming  the  difficult  areas  and
challenges.

As millions of our people stood in long, winding  queues  to  vote  for  the
first time during the democratic elections in  1994,  it  was  hard  not  to
notice a large number of women, some with small babies on their backs,  some
with walking sticks and some ailing from exhaustion, waiting to  make  their
mark.

This  determination  by  mostly  ordinary  women,  young  and  old,  was   a
continuation of the central role that the women of our country  have  played
in the struggle to attain freedom in  our  land.  It  is  my  view  that  in
opening a debate of this nature, the place of women in our  struggle  should
be appropriately recorded and properly acknowledged.

At the time when we had a similar debate in the lower House, I had  stressed
that one of the most  reassuring  aspects  of  the  role  of  women  in  the
struggle had been the demonstration of unity across race and  across  narrow
political divides, as demonstrated during the negotiations  period  in  this
country.

We should continue to celebrate the fact that during these negotiations  not
only did women make a strong contribution but that as  far  as  possible  we
strived to speak with one voice. The success and power  of  a  united  force
for a common cause was demonstrated then and it is something that  is  still
possible for women to achieve. We have once more  reiterated  the  call  for
women to create a common platform wherein we can engage together  on  issues
affecting women in our country.

When asking the question whether our 10 years  of  democracy  have  had  any
meaning for women, I guess we might have to start by acknowledging  that  to
see this democracy working will bring great  fulfilment  to  women  as  they
gave up and lost a lot to get where we are. Of course, that is only  in  the
first instance, but the fact that today we live  in  a  democratic  country,
where we are working hard to build a united nation where  there  is  respect
for human rights and where everybody is free to participate  without  regard
for sex, race and creed, is cause for celebration for women.

Of course, if we were asked whether this has brought solutions  to  all  the
problems facing  us,  the  answer  would  be,  no.  The  criticism  normally
directed at our  Government  regarding  the  issue  of  the  improvement  of
quality of life in this country has always been that our  efforts  have  not
yet reached everyone. It is a correct assessment, I believe.
However, I must say that just because we have not yet arrived at  our  long-
term objective, does not mean that  progress  has  not  been  made  or  that
things are sliding towards the worst as some of our colleagues  have  sought
to argue. In our interaction with communities we still find a lot  of  women
who are still both  subjected  to  abuse  in  the  home  and  have  violence
directed at them in public.

There are still many without basic literacy and who cannot write  their  own
personal communications in private. Too  many  of  them  are  still  without
formal employment and some still die of terrible  diseases.  In  most  rural
parts of our country there is still an  unacceptable  number  of  women  who
walk long distances to carry water and collect firewood.  These  are  issues
that members are mostly aware of. These are the life stories of women,  some
of whom we know, and these are issues we have raised from time to time  when
we came back from our constituencies. We will continue to do so.

As a Government that has been put to into power on a  platform  of  bringing
change and building  a  better  life  we  cannot  find  comfort  until  this
situation has changed.

There are other real stories, however, where we have seen a lot of hope.  We
have  met  women  whose  lives  have  improved  due  to  the  provision   of
electricity where they live and today their streets are much  safer  because
of lighting. This has a direct relationship  to  the  reduction  of  violent
incidents such as rape and serial killings.

We have also met many women who are celebrating that, unlike  in  the  past,
they can now own their own houses registered in their own names without  the
complexities of oppressive laws. The new clinics that  have  been  built  to
bring quality, primary health care to rural areas have meant a lot to  those
who used to travel long distances to receive care.

I have personally seen the delight and sense of  pride  of  many  women  who
have received their matriculation certificates at a much older age in  their
lives, whereas in the past they were deprived of the right to go  to  school
and condemned to the home where they had to bear and bring up children.

The ABET programme is bringing a lot of hope and change in  the  quality  of
their lives and this has opened a lot of  opportunities  for  them.  As  hon
members know, most women remain at home in the villages when their  husbands
migrate to seek work in the big cities. One of  the  biggest  problems  that
come with this kind of arrangement is that of  communication.  Husbands  and
wives have been forced to wait for letters in the  post  to  send  important
information to each other. This has normally taken  too  long  and  and  has
been a great inconvenience to interaction within families.

Today Government has made it obligatory for telecommunications operators  to
provide telephones to the rural areas.  Multipurpose  centres,  as  well  as
telecentres, have also been  provided  by  our  Government  to  give  people
increased access to communication technologies. This has  had  a  tremendous
impact on the lives of these ordinary people, particularly the women.
At a policy level, members in this House should acknowledge their  own  role
as public representatives in helping to steer a new and  progressive  policy
regime with regards to issues affecting women. For its part  Parliament  has
passed various pieces of legislation that  have  a  direct  bearing  on  the
quality of life of women.

Against a lot of  pressure,  we  insisted  on  passing  the  Termination  of
Pregnancy Act, which ushered in a milestone  in  regard  to  the  manner  in
which society uses women's rights and the importance of the  need  for  them
to take decisions on matters affecting their bodies.

Policies regarding preferential procurement, as well as affirmative  action,
have opened ways for women to participate actively in the economy. It is  no
longer odd today to see more and more women swelling the ranks  of  business
entrepreneurs  through  the  opening  of  opportunities  created  by   black
economic empowerment policies.

Whereas in the past black women were limited  to  certain  women's  careers,
such as nursing,  teaching  and  secretarial  work,  today  the  country  is
benefiting a great deal from  utilising  the  resourcefulness  of  women  in
business.

The success in the fight for women's emancipation in our country  has  never
been an isolated case. The programme of Government to  improve  the  quality
of life of every South African is also a commitment that covers women.  This
struggle also cannot just be limited to women within our borders. There  are
many other issues that affect women all over the world that need our  common
attention.

It was with this line  of  thinking  that  the  recent  ANC  Women's  League
conference took a decision to mobilise and rally  all  South  African  women
behind saving the life of Amina Lawal of Nigeria.  The  conference  declared
that South Africans cannot afford to be  indifferent  to  the  suffering  of
others, particularly women of other nations here in Africa and globally.

In this regard, I would like to reiterate the call that we need to  add  our
voice as a nation and as members of Parliament gathered here in  support  of
the growing pleas to save the life of Amina Lawal, a young mother of thirty-
one years, who has been condemned to die by the courts in Nigeria.

The case of Amina Lawal  and  millions  of  other  women  in  her  position,
demonstrates that the emancipation of  women  should  be  complete  and  all
forms  of  oppression  should  be  abolished,  whether  they  be  political,
economic, national, religious or in  the  guise  of  tradition.  It  is  our
appeal that the entire nation  of  peace-loving  South  Africans  stands  in
solidarity with this woman to spare her life.

We need to put the record straight regarding the essence of our campaign  to
save the life of Amina Lawal. As South  Africans,  it  has  never  been  our
intention to undermine the rights of other people  and  the  sovereignty  of
other countries. We recognise that, just like South  Africa,  Nigeria  is  a
country of diversity which  recognises  the  rights  of  people  to  worship
freely. We are, however, insisting that the democratic  culture  in  Nigeria
also respects the right to life for all its citizens.

In our view, Amina Lawal is equally entitled to these  rights.  Integral  to
our religion is the built-in virtue of  forgiveness.  For  this  reason,  we
appeal to the Nigerian society and the state,  particularly  the  President,
to exercise this compassion and pardon her.

We believe that one of the things South African women should celebrate  with
the attainment of our democracy is that they do not have to be subjected  to
the same treatment Amina Lawal is facing in her country.

In this country the state will implement laws that  regulate  human  conduct
in line with the Constitutional  order,  for  which  we  have  so  painfully
fought, side by  side.  Gone  are  the  days  of  the  Immorality  Act  that
regulated and infringed on personal lives of people in  the  similar  manner
that the sentence passed on Amina Lawal does.
For this and  many  other  reasons,  South  African  women  have  a  lot  to
celebrate at the coming of  age  of  our  democracy.  As  I  have  mentioned
earlier, the struggle for women's emancipation is  long  and  tedious.  This
Government has made a commitment to advancing the  current  gains,  but  the
real challenge lies in making sure that women work  together  for  a  common
cause. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms M P THEMBA:  Hon  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  special  and
permanent delegates,  ngicala  ngekuhalalisela  iNdvuna  ngekukhetfwa  kwayo
kutsi ibe nguMengameli waboMake belicembu le-ANC  lapha  eNingizimu  Afrika.
[I want to start off by congratulating the Minister on her election  as  the
President of the ANC Women's League in South  Africa.]  I  say,  Malibongwe!
[Praise!] [Interjections.]

The ANC has continuously sought to confront and remove the obstacles  facing
the advancement of women in every aspect of society - in  their  homes,  the
criminal justice system,  education,  the  workplace,  the  economy  and  in
Government.
This commitment is based on  our  understanding  of  the  inextricable  link
between  freedom  and  the  emancipation  of  women.  The  objectives  of  a
democratic, nonracial, nonsexist and prosperous society cannot  be  realised
to its fullest unless women  have  been  empowered  to  participate  in  all
aspects of life as equals with any other member of society.

Since the ANC was elected as the  Government  in  1994,  we  have  used  the
democratic processes to translate this commitment into  visible  terms.  Our
organisation has been the common denominator in most, if not all, pieces  of
legislation, policies and programmes aimed at improving the quality of  life
and status of women.

As we celebrated August  as  Women's  Month,  it  was  appropriate  that  we
reflected on the progress that we made since 1994. This reflective  exercise
should also  acknowledge  some  of  the  mistakes  we  have  made,  and  the
challenges we still face in terms of gender equality.

The Constitution is the most significant piece of legislation which  impacts
on women. Its equality  clause,  which  has  been  given  greater  substance
through the passing of the Promotion of Equality and  Prevention  of  Unfair
Discrimination Act, incorporates the acceptance of  women  as  having  equal
rights to men.

This acceptance of the equal and inalienable rights of  women  emerged  from
our long struggle against the system of institutional racism  in  which  the
respect for human rights were determined by skin colour and, further  within
the various racial groupings, by gender. African  women  suffered  the  most
humiliation. They  were  discriminated  against  because  they  were  black,
women, and poor. This triple exploitation saw them assigned  to  the  lowest
rung on the social ladder.

This is the kind of legacy which we as the  ANC  and  the  country  seek  to
address. Guided by our own policies and the Constitution, we have  developed
a National Gender Policy Framework, which sets out our country's vision  for
women's  empowerment  and  gender  equality.  We   have   also   created   a
comprehensive gender  machinery  in  all  three  spheres  of  government  to
implement our national gender policy.

At the national level, there is the Office on the Status of  Women,  located
in the Presidency, and the gender focal points  in  government  departments,
even if this is not so in all departments.  The  Office  on  the  Status  of
Women is the principal  co-ordinating  structure  for  the  national  gender
machinery. Its task is to co-ordinate the  implementation  of  gender  plans
and strategies in national departments.

At parliamentary level, we  have  the  Joint  Monitoring  Committee  on  the
Improvement of Quality of Life  and  Status  of  Women.  We  also  have  the
Multiparty Women's Parliamentary Caucus. These mechanisms  provide  a  forum
in which women and men in Parliament can discuss and debate  gender  issues.
It  also  provides  capacity-building  initiatives  for  women  and  men  in
Parliament and creates access points for advocacy by  women's  organisations
in civil society. In addition, these mechanisms serve to monitor and  ensure
within Parliament that legislation is gender sensitive.

A number of independent statutory bodies have  also  been  established  that
are involved in gender issues. Most notably,  there  is  the  Commission  on
Gender Equality, which has a constitutional mandate for  the  promotion  and
protection of gender equality.

Many  provinces  have  established  provincial   structures   within   their
legislatures. As the needs of provinces vary, so too  will  the  structures.
The National Gender Policy Framework, however, recommends that  the  general
principle  of  the  national  model  be  followed.  This  will  include  the
establishment of an office on the status of women in the premiers'  offices,
as has already  been  done,  the  gender  focal  points  in  all  provincial
departments, and the monitoring committees in  the  provincial  legislatures
where they have not yet been established.

Another major achievement is the dramatic increase in the  number  of  women
in Parliament. While the ANC has opted for a quota  system  that  guarantees
women one-third of its electoral list  positions,  opposition  parties  like
the DP have taken a principled stance against the  quota,  arguing  that  it
degrades merit and creates a glass ceiling for women.

The quality of participation by women in Parliament has proven  them  wrong.
Women have made significant  contributions  in  Parliament  and  have  added
immense value to its debates and the quality of legislation  passed  by  the
institution. It is no surprise, therefore, that the increase in  the  number
of women in Parliament has coincided with the passing of a number of  pieces
of legislation of particular meaning to women such as the Domestic  Violence
Act, the Maintenance Act, the Choice on Termination  of  Pregnancy  Act  and
the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act. The Joint  Monitoring  Committee
on the Improvement of Quality of Life and Status of Women  has  visited  all
the provinces to check on the implementation, whether the implementation  of
these  laws  is  successful,  or  whether  there  are  any  frustrations  or
problems. The committee will soon be tabling the report in this House.

With regards to challenges, although more practical measures and steps  have
been taken by the ANC in ensuring that the plight  of  women  is  addressed,
the impact is, nonetheless, not as profound  as  it  ought  to  be.  Women's
issues will remain a priority that needs focused  attention  by  Government,
Parliament and society at large. We continue to be faced with the  challenge
of further facilitating this process that  will  see  an  end  to  the  ill-
treatment of women and thereby restoring the dignity and  respect  to  which
they are entitled.

A key challenge in addressing gender inequality at local level will  be  our
ability  to  ensure  gender  mainstreaming  and  integration   through   the
Integrated Development Plans of municipalities. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Ms B N SONO: Deputy Chair, may I take  this  opportunity  to  recognise  the
newly elected President of the ANC Women's League, hon  Mapisa-Nqakula,  and
wish her godspeed in  the  work  ahead,  of  navigating  the  path  of  this
organisation. There is no doubt that the  quality  of  life  and  status  of
women in South Africa today is far better than it was prior  to  the  advent
of our new democracy. The idea of women  becoming  economically  active  and
economically empowered is no longer a far-fetched dream.

We as women celebrate the efforts of Government and progress made thus  far.
I'm  going  to  look  at  our  Constitution,  the  Bill   of   Rights,   the
international instruments that we  have  signed  or  acceded  to,  and  then
domestic  legislation,  in  particular  the  Promotion   of   Equality   and
Prevention of Discrimination Act, which has particular significance for  the
equality of women, and lastly, the broad-based BEE policy.

The  South  African  Constitution,  Act  108  of  1996,  makes  no  specific
provision in the Bill of Rights for the protection of women under  the  law.
But section 9(1) of the Bill of Rights, the Equality  clause,  states  that,
``Everyone is equal before the law and has the  right  to  equal  protection
and benefit of the law''.

If I look at the escalating level of violence against  women  and  children,
and the failure of our legal system to protect us, I believe  that  even  at
the most basic level of protecting our very lives the state  is  failing  in
terms  of  its  constitutional  obligations.  Section  9(2)  proclaims  that
equality includes the full and equal enjoyment of all rights  and  freedoms.
It also enjoins the state to take legislative steps to  protect  or  advance
persons who have been disadvantaged by unfair discrimination.

Section 36, which is known as a Limitation Clause, states  that  the  rights
in the Bill of Rights may be limited by  any  law  of  general  application,
only if such limitation is reasonable, and then sets the factors which  must
be taken into account when limiting such rights. Our rights to  equality  as
women may only be taken away from us if good reasons exist for doing so.

In regard to international instruments, in  1993  South  Africa  signed  the
UN's Convention on the Elimination of All Forms  of  Discrimination  Against
Women, and ratified it  in  1995.  We  have  not  yet  signed  the  optional
protocol on Cedaw, which was adopted in 1999. We also have  not  yet  signed
or ratified the draft protocol to the African Charter on the elimination  on
all forms of discrimination against women.

Already in 1993, the  need  for  Government  in  the  budget  allocation  to
include resources targeted at the elimination of violence against women  was
recognised in the UN's Declaration on the Elimination  of  Violence  Against
Women. Whilst a declaration is not a binding  treaty,  it  does  set  out  a
common international standard that  governments  should  follow,  hence  the
replacement of the Prevention of Family Violence Act  of  1993  by  the  new
Domestic Violence Act. This is a very important piece  of  legislation,  but
implementation  thereof  is  seriously  undermined  by  lack  of   committed
resources and co-ordination by departments.
On the front of women's economic empowerment, poverty  is  a  major  problem
for women in the country. The systems, the socially engineered  location  of
women in rural areas and the underdevelopment  of  infrastructure  in  these
areas have been, and still are, serious issues of concern.  Whilst  enabling
legislation, such as the broad-based BEE and  the  Preferential  Procurement
Policy Framework Act, etc, is in place, movement towards delivery  has  been
ad hoc, largely disjointed and with minimal impact.

In the South  African  context,  BEE  should  be  a  vital  element  in  the
relationship of the  challenge  and  response  to  economic  empowerment  of
women.  An  analysis  of  the  Act,  in  terms  of  its  fulfilment  of  its
constitutional  obligations,  shows  that  it  falls  short  of  creating  a
specific remedy of distributive justice.

Lastly, the Promotion of Equality and Unfair  Discrimination  Act  expressly
prohibits female genital mutilation and associated practices, but  does  not
prohibit the more prevalent male circumcision. An analysis of  the  Act,  in
terms of its constitutional obligations,  shows  that  in  contrast  to  the
human rights law, and at civil law level, the  legislation  falls  short  of
creating specific criminal offences where gender is shown  to  have  been  a
factor in the commission of such offences.

There is no direct cross-reference  to  legislation  such  as  the  Domestic
Violence Act, which could have strengthened the efficacy  of  the  Promotion
of Equality and Prevention of Discrimination Act. It is with  this  in  mind
that we  should,  when  analysing  the  efficacy  of  the  legal  protection
available to women, say that an approach which focuses only on some  limited
areas of rights and freedoms as the proper domain  of  gender  equality  and
improvement in the status of women, would only be  a  partial  understanding
of and response to the historical challenge of providing  the  equality  and
improvement promised to women in our Constitution. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chairperson, hon members and  hon  Minister  let  me
start off by saying  that  national  liberation  in  South  Africa  has  not
automatically  guaranteed  the  emancipation  of  women.  It  is   also   of
importance to acknowledge all women  who  have,  throughout  history,  waged
relentless  struggles  against  the  oppression   of   women.   A   national
organisation of women should be made a reality, encompassing  all  women  in
our society, with particular attention being paid to  mobilising  our  women
in rural areas.

We as women know that culture is a way of life and that many aspects of  our
cultural traditions and practices are oppressive to women. It  is  for  this
reason that we are calling on our President  to  play  a  critical  role  in
stopping the intended brutal stoning to death of Lawal. It is  a  pity  that
no action will be taken against her partner.  We,  as  the  ANC,  must  form
cultural forums to facilitate cultural education  and  debate,  particularly
around culture and the oppression of women.

As our former President Nelson Mandela, in his first speech at  the  opening
of South Africa's first  democratically  elected  Parliament,  said,  and  I
quote:


  It is vitally important that all structures of Government, including  the
  President himself, should understand this fully that  freedom  cannot  be
  achieved unless the  women  have  been  emancipated  from  all  forms  of
  oppression. All of us must take this on board that the objectives of  the
  Reconstruction and Development Programme will  not  have  been  realised,
  unless we see in visible and practical terms, that the condition  of  the
  women of our country has radically changed for the better, and that  they
  have been empowered to intervene in all aspects of life  as  equals  with
  any member of society.

We believe that gender equality and gender equity are not just human  rights
issues and  are  not  just  an  aspect  of  democracy,  but  are,  in  fact,
preconditions for democracy. This  is  particularly  so  in  a  contemporary
democracy, which requires the full participation of all sectors  of  society
not just in casting votes, but also in  all  decision-making  processes  and
especially in the allocation of  resources.  It  is  also  our  belief  that
democracy itself has expanded in the past few decades to include the  voices
of some women, that there has been increased demands for real  power-sharing
and for the promotion and protection of women's basic human rights.

We, as the women in the ANC, further believe that gender inequality  hampers
or even halts the development process by excluding, undermining or  limiting
-  through  inequitable  policies  in   particular,   such   as   education,
employment, the health and justice systems -  the  contribution  that  women
are able to make to the economy. All development processes  that  ignore  or
sideline gender issues will either fail or at best only partially succeed.

As women, we should know that poverty is not just about income. It is  about
people's lost creativity  and  their  stunted  potential  to  contribute  to
society; it is about the denial of access to opportunities  and  choices  to
lead a decent life, achieve a better standard of living  and  to  gain  more
freedom, dignity and self-respect. It is about being able  to  feed,  clothe
and send children to school -  all  things  that  are  important  for  human
existence generally and for women in particular.

When it comes to violence  against  women,  few  people  are  aware  of  the
campaign on  gender  violence,  even  though  our  former  President  Nelson
Mandela launched the White Ribbon campaign in 1995.  President  Thabo  Mbeki
launched the No Violence Against Women campaign in 2002, with the  intention
of reviving the campaign  and  highlighting  the  importance  of  addressing
gender violence in South Africa. We as women should take a leading  role  in
fighting atrocities against women and children. It must be made  known  that
nobody in his sane mind can speak of freedom if women do not feel that  they
are full citizens of this country.

As women, we should strengthen the moral regeneration campaign in  order  to
have our society respecting women and children. We should make  it  a  point
that never again will we hear about two-month-old babies being raped;  never
again should we hear about  another  baby  Tshepang  being  molested.  Never
again should we women  and  children  be  raped  and  the  perpetrators  not
brought to book.

Legislation has been passed to protect women, such as the Domestic  Violence
Act of 1998, and to  ensure  that  perpetrators  are  brought  to  book  and
survivors are protected.  Tragically,  very  little  noticeable  change  has
occurred since 1998.

It is a fact that our girl children are vulnerable,  both  at  home  and  at
school, to the sexual advances of male relatives, friends and teachers,  and
most of these situations end up in rape. This problem has  been  exacerbated
by a seemingly commonly held belief, in  some  quarters,  that  sex  with  a
virgin will cure men of HIV/Aids. [Interjections.]

A commitment should be made by  all  present  here  today  to  take  a  more
radical way in mobilising communities in  the  fight  against  HIV/Aids;  to
train families to be able to deal with members  of  families  who  are  HIV-
positive; and to embark  on  a  door-to-door  campaign  to  mobilise  people
around the theme of ``abstain, be faithful and use condoms''.

We should be at the forefront of enhancing unity in  Africa  and  strive  to
create conditions for peace, which will lead to stability on  the  continent
as a whole. We must also destroy boundaries that exist in our minds  and  be
able to deal with those boundaries that were imposed  on  Africa  to  create
disunity. We should be applauded as the ANC because the  Government  of  the
people has undertaken various measures to improve the position of women  and
to advance gender equality in all spheres.

The increasing numbers of women employed in the SA National  Defence  Force,
SA  Police  Service  and  Correctional  Services,  and  those  selected   to
executive positions, have further strengthened this commitment. In 1994  the
apartheid government only  had  one  female  Cabinet  Minister,  the  former
Minister of Health, and  one  female  Deputy  Minister,  the  former  Deputy
Minister for Justice. In today's Cabinet,  four  of  the  25  Ministers  and
eight of the 14 Deputy Ministers are women. [Applause.] Here in  Parliament,
out of 35 chairpersons of portfolio committees, 10 are  women,  and  out  of
the 117 women in Parliament, 89 are from the party of the people - the  ANC.
[Interjections.]

The department is focusing on the acceleration of equality between  men  and
women. As far as  policies  and  legislation  are  concerned,  policies  are
gender-sensitive. The Correction  Services  Bill  contains  provisions  that
mention women particularly. Special provision is made for the dietary  needs
of pregnant women. The Bill also provides  that  only  women  officials  may
search women prisoners, and that men may not be present when  that  happens.
The military career paths for women are the same as for men.  Women  undergo
the same training and can apply for the same posts as men, including  combat
posts.

In conclusion, it is appropriate to quote our President, Thabo  Mbeki,  when
he  said  in  his  speech  at  the  opening  of   South   African's   second
democratically elected Parliament:
  We must continue to focus on the vital questions of the  development  and
  emancipation of women, as well as to further integrate  this  issue  with
  all Government programmes.

It is very important for us as women to smile, because we as South  Africans
are creating a new dawn every day. Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Hon MEMBERS: Igama lamakhosikhazi! [The name of women!] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! I am pausing  a
little bit to allow you to complete. Thank you. Hon members, just  before  I
call the next speaker, I've been made aware that there are learners  in  the
gallery. The Chair would like to acknowledge the learners  from  Setotoloane
Elson High School in Limpopo province.  [Applause.]  They  are  from  grades
Nine, 10, 11 and 12. Some of them are doing Economics, Maths, Physics,  OBE,
Social Science and other science subjects.

All I can say to them is that they have visited the  most  important  House.
This is one of the two Houses in Parliament, which is called the  NCOP,  and
the delegates of the Council debating here are from all  over  the  country.
Please engage them in your schools if you want them to come and talk to  you
and tell you about the National Council of Provinces. You are most  welcome.
Enjoy the debates.

Mrs L G NGCOBO (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairperson. It  is  my
pleasure to be able  to  address  this  gathering  on  this  very  important
subject on women.

At this landmark we stop and look back at what has been achieved  under  the
new dispensation. We also turn our eyes to the  future  and  ascertain  what
remains to be done. Will there ever be a time when it shall be said that  we
have done enough? When we look at the status of the majority  of  our  South
African women today, these thoughts can be very disturbing. Whereas  we  can
look back with some satisfaction to the  battery  of  laws  that  have  been
passed which aim to enhance and protect women's lives,  we  are  humbled  by
the inadequacies and the paucity of strategies  for  the  implementation  of
these laws.

One other shortcoming is the slow pace of change of attitudes in  the  minds
of both men and women. In the main, men  are  reluctant  to  exchange  their
privileged positions  for  a  fairer  distribution  of  social  justice  and
resources. And let us also admit that a lot of women,  creatures  of  habit,
are so conditioned that  changing  their  attitudes  towards  themselves  is
taking longer than expected. We are dealing here  with  a  backlog  of  deep
psychological impediments in the minds of our people.

In South Africa it may be harder to shift the mindset than  elsewhere  as  a
result of inferiority that is embedded in the social psyche. But  more  than
any other hurdle  in  the  way  to  progress,  is  the  failure  to  provide
institutional infrastructure and resources that would provide both  men  and
women with knowledge and tools that could work for us.  Laws  alone  of  our
Statute Book do not reach our people. We  need  programmes  that  will  both
inform and empower society in the process  of  changing  the  conditions  in
which women find themselves, and in that way empower society itself.

The majority of women in my  province,  KwaZulu-Natal,  are  definitely  not
free. The majority live in poverty and many cannot read or write,  like  all
other  women  in  South  Africa.  They   are   poor   and   unemployed,   or
underemployed. It is painful to recount the catalogue of their  inadequacies
and their suffering. No matter how much we wish otherwise, women are poor  -
too poor, sometimes, even to set themselves free from oppressive  marriages.
They work very hard both at home  and  outside,  but  there's  still  little
value attached to their labour in the household and at work. They  are  then
paid low wages compared to their counterparts.

Past discriminatory laws and traditional laws have denied  women  access  to
property  and  loans,  which  has  hindered  women's  ability  to  be  self-
sufficient. Take any sphere of life, be it health, education, housing,  land
and agriculture, the economy and all else, women have it  hard.  Then  there
are social factors that  no  good  government  can  legislate  against.  I'm
talking of male violence. But even here our  Government  has  been  slow  in
providing amenities such as sheltered accommodation for violated women  that
women all over so desperately need, especially African women, and  education
programmes such as counselling centres  that  can  help  men  out  of  their
violent tendencies ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Hon  member,  your
speaking time has expired.

Mrs L G NGCOBO: ... Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Dankie, meneer die Voorsitter. U sal nou  dalk  wonder  waarom
moet dan nou juis die oudste lid van die NNP hierdie taak vandag verrig,  en
dít nogal 'n man. Tot my skade en skande moet ek egter  erken  dat  die  NNP
net deur mans in die Nasionale Raad van Provinsies verteenwoordig word.  Dis
'n skande.

Dit ten spyte,  meneer  die  Voorsitter,  die  laaste  Markinor-verslag  het
getoon dat vroue 60% tot  70%  van  die  ondersteuningsbasis  van  my  party
uitmaak. Dit bevestig dat die NNP die regte boodskap uitstuur, en  inderdaad
wel erkenning gee aan die belangrike historiese bydrae  wat  die  vroue  van
Suid-Afrika in die verlede gemaak het, en die belangrike rol wat  hulle  nog
steeds in ons samelewing op byna elke terrein speel. My party  is  ook  baie
dankbaar dat daar  sedert  1994  wel  goeie  vordering  gemaak  is  met  die
erkenning van vroue-regte. Die vordering wat gemaak is, skiet egter nog  ver
tekort. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follow.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Perhaps  you  will  wonder  why  the
oldest member of the NNP has to perform this task today, and a man at  that.
To my dismay and disgrace I have to admit that the NNP is  only  represented
by men in the National Council of Provinces. That is a disgrace.

In spite  of  that,  Mr  Chairman,  the  most  recent  Markinor  report  has
indicated that women make up 60% to 70% of the support base of my party.  It
proves that the NNP is sending out the right message, and is  indeed  giving
recognition to the important historical contribution made  in  the  past  by
the women of South Africa, and to the important role they are still  playing
in almost every sphere of our society. My party is also very  grateful  that
good progress has in fact been made about the good progress made since  1994
with regard to the recognition of  women's  rights.  However,  the  progress
that has been made is still quite insufficient.]

If one looks at the latest figures on the issue  of  gender  representation,
it  gives  one  a  picture  of  how  far  we  have  come,  as  well  as  the
shortcomings. Of the members in  the  National  Assembly  31,3%  are  women.
Women make up 24% of the management in the Public Service, while 21% of  our
ambassadors and high commissioners are female; 20% of our judges and 26%  of
our magistrates are  female.  The  highest  representation  is  amongst  the
deputy ministers, which is almost 50%.

Dit gaan egter nie net oor statistieke of syfers, of  hoë  poste  wat  vroue
beklee nie. Dit gaan ook nie net oor die skrapping van wette  of  regulasies
of konvensies wat vroue van hulle regte ontneem, of die maak van nuwe  wette
om hulle regte te beskerm nie, en dat die Grondwet  van  Suid-Afrika  vroue-
regte verseker nie. Maar hierdie regte moet eerder  'n  praktiese  realiteit
in die lewe van vroue in Suid-Afrika word. Vroue en kinders  moet  kan  lewe
in 'n land waar hulle veilig voel, waar hulle nie elke  dag  hoef  te  vrees
dat hulle slagoffers van geweldenaars of  verkragters  kan  word  nie,  waar
hulle nie hoef te vrees vir die veiligheid van hulle kinders  in  die  skole
nie, en waar hulle nie elke dag moet wonder waar hulle môre  kos  vir  hulle
gesinne gaan kry nie.

Ek was baie ontsteld om uit 'n opname, wat onlangs  gedoen  is,  te  verneem
dat 62% van vroue wat die broodwinners van gesinne is  in  uiterste  armoede
leef.  Meer  moet  gedoen  word  om  'n  gunstige  klimaat   te   skep   wat
entrepreneurskap onder hierdie vroue sal bevorder, en hulle die  geleentheid
sal gee om hulself te bemagtig en te wys wat hulle kan doen. Ek glo vas  dat
die bemagtiging van vroue veral in die platteland dan tot 'n groot mate  die
antwoord tot die opheffing van armoede sal wees. Dit is nie  net  die  vroue
wat hulle in die hoogste raadsale en howe  verteenwoordig  wat  die  verskil
maak nie - dit  is  ook  belangrik  -  maar  die  opheffing  van  hulle  wat
ongeletterd is, en die slagoffers van armoede en gesinsgeweld is, is net  so
belangrik. Die bewusmaking van vroue in die platteland oor wat  hulle  regte
is en volwasse-onderrig kan 'n groot rol speel in die  verbetering  van  die
lewenskwaliteit van ons vroue-gesinne. (Translation of Afrikaans  paragraphs

[However, it is not just about statistics or figures, or  about  high  posts
filled by women.  It  is  also  not  just  about  repealing  legislation  or
regulations on conventions depriving women of their rights, or the  drafting
of new legislation to protect their rights, or  about  the  Constitution  of
South Africa ensuring women's rights. These rights must become  a  practical
reality in the lives of women in South Africa. Women and children must  live
in a country where they feel safe, where they don't have to fear  every  day
that they could become the victims of  oppressors  or  rapists,  where  they
don't have to fear for the safety of their children in  schools,  and  where
they don't have to wonder every day where  they  will  get  food  for  their
families the next day.

I was very upset to learn from a recent survey that 62%  of  women  who  are
the breadwinners of families live in extreme poverty. More  should  be  done
to create a favourable climate that will promote entrepreneurs  among  these
women and give them the opportunity to empower themselves and to  show  what
they are capable of.  I  firmly  believe  that  the  empowerment  of  women,
especially in rural areas, will be the answer to the abolition  of  poverty.
It is not only the women who represent them in the highest council  chambers
and courts who  make  the  difference,  that  is  also  important,  but  the
upliftment of those who are illiterate, who are the victims of  poverty  and
domestic violence, is just as important. Making women in rural  areas  aware
of their rights, as well as adult education, can play an important  role  in
the improvement of the quality of life of our families headed by women.]

I say this because I have faith in the abilities  and  the  courage  of  the
women of South Africa. We admire them for the fact that recent studies  have
shown that many working women are single parents,  and  that  working  women
are actually working one extra month every year. The average workload for  a
man is 68 hours per week, whilst that for a woman is 78 hours per  week.  In
spite of that, a further study done by the  Equal  Opportunities  Commission
has shown that women are still earning far less than men. The  report  shows
that women's gross individual income is on average 51%  less  than  that  of
men.

There are many other challenges that we still face, but the women  of  South
Africa have shown that in the past, and still today, they do unite for  what
they believe in. I therefore believe  that  these  challenges  too  will  be
overcome. I also believe that a healthy, happy family plays a  pivotal  role
in the wellbeing of our women.
To conclude, I would like to quote from an old Chinese proverb:


  If there is light in the soul, there will be beauty  in  the  person.  If
  there is beauty in the person, there will be harmony  in  the  house.  If
  there is harmony in the house, there will be  order  in  the  nation.  If
  there is order in the nation, there will be peace in the world.

Let us all pray to the Lord to fill our  souls  with  light.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Deputy Chairperson, I think it is important  to
begin by saying that Deputy Minister Mapisa-Nqakula made an important  point
when she said that we cannot claim complete success, nor should we  fail  to
acknowledge that there has been progress. I think it is vital to remind  hon
colleagues who believe otherwise that years of oppression  and  exploitation
can never be ameliorated by nine years of a new democracy.

I would like to focus on how we might, as a  country,  engage  in  the  very
important task of ensuring that we do measure our progress towards  equality
in South Africa. A United Nations body, the Economic Commission for  Africa,
and its African Centre  for  Gender  and  Development,  have  undertaken  an
assessment programme called the African Gender and  Development  Index.  The
aim of this index is  to  provide  an  effective  monitoring  mechanism  for
gender equality. The results of this Africa-wide index will be contained  in
the African Women's Report that is due out before  the  end  of  this  year.
This report is going to be an important  tool  for  informing  regional  and
global processes on the situation and status of women in Africa.  The  index
measures gender equality and the changes in gender  relations,  as  well  as
the effects of gender policies over the past 10 years.  It  has  in  it  two
parts - a gender status index and the African women's progress scoreboard.

The gender status index is  a  measure  of  relative  gender  equality  that
captures those issues related to women's empowerment that  can  be  measured
quantitatively. The status index is based on  three  blocks:  social  power,
economic power and political  power.  For  example,  we  could  say  "social
power"  includes  indicators  on  education  and  health.  "Economic  power"
includes indicators on income, time use and employment,  and  on  access  to
resources. And "political power" includes indicators on women's position  in
legislatures and the executive.

The African women's progress scoreboard is a measure  of  government  policy
performance regarding women's empowerment, and deals  with  the  qualitative
aspect of these issues. It's main aim is to assess whether governments  have
complied with the various conventions  and  charters,  such  as  CEDAW,  the
Beijing Platform of Action and the Nepad  programmes  that  our  governments
have  ratified.  The  scoreboard  aims  to  capture  the   mechanisms   that
governments have to implement  their  gender  policies.  So,  these  indexes
complement each other.

The Office on the Status of Women has undertaken the task of  compiling  the
index for the Africa Economic Commission. The office  has  commissioned  the
Gender Research Programme of the Centre for Applied  Legal  Studies  at  the
University  of  the  Witwatersrand,  under  the  leadership  of  Prof  Cathy
Albertyn, to draw up the status index  and  the  women's  scoreboard.  Their
work is complete and is in the process of  being  considered  by  our  Joint
Monitoring Committee on the Improvement of Quality of  Life  and  Status  of
Women here in Parliament. It  is  an  immensely  complex  document,  and  of
course, we cannot at this point do it the justice that it  deserves.  But  I
think as it is the best measure we are likely to have of the improvement  of
gender  equality  under  the  guidance  of  the  ANC  policy-making,  it  is
appropriate to highlight some features.

Firstly, if we  consider  education  as  a  component  of  social  power  at
primary, secondary and tertiary levels in South  Africa,  the  enrolment  of
girls and women is higher than the enrolment of  boys  and  men.  Of  course
there are still imbalances, for example, women outnumber men  in  the  human
sciences at universities and technikons, and  men  outnumber  women  in  the
natural sciences.

This tertiary level success is the product of a lower school  drop-out  rate
for girls. This is a very unusual feature that  we  have  in  South  Africa,
because in most African countries more girls than boys drop  out  of  school
as a result of the unequal burden of caring that  girls  undertake  in  many
African communities. The rates in South Africa  are  a  feature  of  success
that we must strive to maintain and extend.

Monitoring the drop-out trend is critical as  this  trend  is  an  index  of
women's ability to be  productive  in  the  labour  market.  The  more  girl
matriculants there  are,  the  larger  the  pool  from  which  to  draw  for
university and technikon students. All in all, over the  past  10  years  we
have accelerated the trend of educating more girls  and  in  the  long  term
this will have a significant effect on employment and gender equity.

Secondly, let us consider economic  empowerment.  We  have,  as  a  country,
committed  ourselves  to  equal  pay  and  to  the  elimination  of   gender
discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace, yet in practice  much
remains to be done. The first component in the category  of  economic  power
is wage income, and here  women  lag  behind  men  in  all  sectors  of  the
economy. The fact remains that women are more likely to  be  casual  workers
and low-paid workers.

Even in the Public Service, mean wages are lower for women than men. In  the
informal sector, which includes domestic workers,  the  gender-wage  gap  is
even wider than in the  formal  sector.  It  is  notoriously  difficult,  of
course, to measure the amount of unpaid  labour  that  women  contribute  at
work and at home - such as the gentlemen asking us to make tea for  them  at
work. But the African Gender  and  Development  Index  does  consider  it  a
crucial factor and it does measure time use and nonmarket activities.

Not surprisingly, there are still many more male than  female  employers  in
South Africa. More men than women take out loans from banks. More  men  than
women are business partners and more men than women  are  part  of  business
associations and business organisations.

Poverty and unemployment, then, are the greatest  challenges  we  face,  and
women are more likely than men to be at the mercy of these twin threats.  It
is absolutely critical in our view that women farmers are  given  access  to
services that will assist them and their families to survive  on  the  land.
We also need to ensure that women  are  given  equal  access  to  land.  The
Department  of  Land  Affairs  has  prioritised   the   removal   of   legal
restrictions on such access. The policy is there; the implementation has  to
follow through. The various  pieces  of  land  legislation  currently  under
discussion in Parliament will help us in this regard.

Thirdly, let us consider political power. There is no doubt  that  over  the
past 10 years the number of women  in  representative  positions  in  public
life has grown immensely. Look at our Parliament: In 1997, there  were  only
eight women permanent delegates in the NCOP. In 2003 there are 20.  Look  at
our Cabinet: Statistics show that in 1994 there  were  three  women  Cabinet
Ministers out of a Cabinet of 27. In 2003 - and I correct my colleague  here
- there are nine women Ministers out of a Cabinet of 29. [Applause.]

This is but one indication of South Africa's commitment to gender  equality.
Another is the creation of a national gender machinery - the Office for  the
Status of Women in the Presidency. This machinery is for the advancement  of
women at all levels in our society. The establishment of such machinery  was
one of the objectives referred to in the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action.

Women's full representation and participation in  decision-making  positions
in government, in policy-making and in political parties can accelerate  the
transformation  of  gender  relations  in  society,  and  it  is  this  full
participation that  we  should  be  fighting  for.  I  think  that  on  this
indicator the ANC scores extremely well  on  the  index,  and  South  Africa
broadly.

What are our challenges in the future? The progress towards gender  equality
in social and political power components of the index has clearly been  very
impressive, as colleagues have  indicated  in  their  contribution.  Yet,  a
question remains: What has been the impact of  gender-sensitive  legislation
on the lives of the majority of women?

Lots of laws that we pass have  little  or  no  impact  on  changing  sexist
attitudes at home, in the workforce or on the  rugby  field.  Clearly,  laws
such as the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act  of  1998  have  promoted
the equal status of women. This Act, in my view,  is  the  most  significant
legislative  recognition  of  equality  to  date.  All  existing   customary
marriages are fully recognised and wives should be enjoying  full  propriety
capacity and an equal status with their husbands.

I think it is difficult to overestimate the significance of this Act. Yet  a
fundamental challenge remains in the passage of laws to protect  women  from
gender-based violence and abuse. We have made some progress in this  regard.
Part of our response in South Africa was the  Domestic  Violence  Prevention
Act of 1998. This Act recognises that domestic violence is a serious  social
evil and an obstacle to achieving gender equality. It was  a  critical  step
towards making women feel safer than before and a critical  step  in  giving
effect to section 12(c) of the Constitution, which states that everyone  has
the right to be free from all  forms  of  violence  from  either  public  or
private sources.

I would like to conclude by reading a poem  by  Ingrid  de  Kock,  who  many
regard as our most exciting living poet or poetess.  The  poem  encapsulates
and  expresses  women's  negotiating  skills  through  a  very   traditional
metaphor of women's work. It is called Mending, and it can be found  in  her
collection called Transfer.


  In and out, behind, across.
  The formal gesture binds the cloth.
  The stitchery's a surgeon's rhyme,
  a Chinese stamp, a pantomime
  of print. Then spoor. Then trail of red,
  Scabs rise, stigmata from the thread.
  A cotton chronicle congealed,
  A histogram of welts and weals.
  The woman plies her ancient art,
  Her needle sutures as it darts,
  scoring, scripting, scarring, stitching,
  the invisible mending of the heart.

And it is this invisible mending at which women are the  greatest,  and  may
we strengthen such a skill. Thank you very much, Deputy Chair. [Applause.]

Ms R P  MASHANGOANE:  Mohlomphegi  Motlatsa-Modulasetulo,  ba  lebetse  gore
Modulasetulo wa Ntlo ye ke Mmagorena  Naledi  Pandor.  [Deputy  Chairperson,
they have forgotten  that  the  Chairperson  of  this  House  is  Ms  Naledi
Pandor.]

This ANC-led Government can be justifiably  proud  of  its  achievements  in
improving the quality of life of women since it came into power,  especially
in the areas of health and social development.

We can be unashamedly proud of the fact that our mothers now have access  to
affordable generic medicines, whereas previously they could  not  afford  to
pay brand-name prices. Our Government managed to get the cost  of  medicines
lowered  despite  the   challenge   from   large,   US-based   multinational
pharmaceutical companies.

We can be proud that women can make decisions about the reproductive  health
of  their  own  bodies,  especially   when   faced   with   very   difficult
circumstances such as rape, sexual abuse, teenage pregnancies,  poverty  and
incest. We know that in these and other difficult circumstances,  women  are
often driven to find any  means  possible  to  rid  themselves  of  unwanted
pregnancies.  For  these  and  other  reasons,  this  Government  found   it
necessary to create a safe and protected environment in  which  to  have  an
abortion without fear of intimidation and even death. It is in this  context
that the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, Act 92 of 1996, allows  for
legal termination of pregnancy on request for all  women  in  the  first  12
weeks of pregnancy and, under certain defined circumstances, between 12  and
20 weeks. Termination of pregnancy services are provided free of charge.

Also in keeping with the increased recognition  of  reproductive  rights  of
women, the Sterilisation Act, Act 44 of  1998,  gives  women  the  right  to
sterilisation. A person, including those  who  are  disabled  physically  or
mentally, may not be sterilised without her or  his  consent.  In  addition,
the Act recognises that both women and men have a right to  be  informed  of
and have access to safe, effective, affordable  and  acceptable  methods  of
fertility regulation.

Another programme that was set up to improve the  health  of  women  is  the
national guidelines for cervical cancer  screening.  These  guidelines  were
set as a measure to reduce the incidence of  cervical  cancer  by  detecting
and treating the preinvasive stage of the disease. According  to  the  South
African Yearbook 2002's cancer registry, cervical cancer is the second  most
prevalent cancer in women and comprises 16% of all cancers.

We have tried  to  improve  access  to  primary  health  care  not  only  by
improving the physical structure  of  the  many  poorly  constructed  public
clinics and hospitals across the country, but also by improving the  quality
of care, access and increased availability  of  essential  drugs  needed  to
treat the poor. The budget for primary health care,  which  is  usually  the
first port of call for poor women,  has  increased  substantially  over  the
past nine years. By current estimates, it should rise to R7 billion.

We have been confronted with a very dangerous, sometimes fatal, disease,  in
the form of HIV/Aids. Women and young people have been  some  of  those  who
are more directly affected than any other group. The Department of  Health's
2003 National HIV and Syphilis Antenatal  Sero-Prevalence  Survey  in  South
Africa 2002 says that, and I quote:


  HIV/Aids continues to be one of the biggest  challenges  faced  by  South
  Africa today, alongside poverty, joblessness and other social  ills  that
  the Government is trying hard to eradicate. In  2001,  it  was  estimated
  that 4,7 million South Africans were living with HIV and  Aids,  of  whom
  189 000 were babies. However, all of us remain affected.  The  challenges
  of preventing new infections, providing treatment  to  the  infected  and
  care to those who are in need of our compassion, remain.

In our war to combat this scourge, we have embarked  upon  initiatives  such
as the Partnership Against Aids programmes;  Aids  prevention  and  training
programmes;  HIV  testing  programmes  in   many   clinics;   wider   condom
distribution of about  450  million;  widespread  use  of  mass  media,  for
example the  LoveLife  Programme;  HIV  testing  for  pregnant  women;  and,
HIV/Aids home-based care and other initiatives.

The 2003-04 budget will add R3,3 billion over three years to  speed  up  the
prevention of  mother-to-child  transmission  -  PMTCT  -  and  postexposure
prophylaxis roll-out in order to strengthen treatment and  initiatives  over
the medium term. Mothers are additionally cared for, when it comes  to  HIV,
through the provision of the national maternity care  guidelines  that  were
launched in 2000 which deal with the prevention of  opportunistic  infection
in HIV-positive mothers, and the provision of micronutrient  supplements  to
help ensure the wellbeing of mothers.

Social Development, because of the initiative  of  the  ANC-led  Government,
has continually expanded its mandate to accommodate,  as  far  as  possible,
the sometimes overwhelming needs of the poor and most  vulnerable.  Already,
Social  Development's  share   of   the   overall   provisional   Government
expenditure has grown from 19,4% in 1999-2000 to an estimated 25,8% in 2005-
06. The most vulnerable invariably include women, especially those in  rural
areas, who are the primary beneficiaries of social grants, welfare  services
and food relief programmes that are geared towards eradicating poverty,  and
have been this  Government's  priority  in  the  past  nine  years.  Already
beneficiary numbers have increased from 2,4 million in  1998  to  more  than
5,6 million in 2003.

The  implementation  of  the  child  support  grant  has  been  particularly
successful. There have been 5 million beneficiaries since  the  introduction
of the grant, and that represents 19,2%.  The  phased-in  extension  of  the
child support grant to 14-year olds  will  add  an  additional  3,2  million
children to the grant system. Other programmes for  women  are  those  which
support the subsidisation of shelters for  abused  women  and  children  and
subsidised homes for older persons.

The challenge for Social Development is to improve on its  welfare  services
and transformation  programmes,  which  consistently  receive  the  smallest
budget allocations at national  and  provincial  levels.  In  essence,  this
could mean that the Government is not providing sufficiently in the area  of
developmental services. The directorate has also been  seriously  ...  [Time

Mrs P NKONYENI (KwaZulu-Natal): Thank you, hon Chairperson and hon  members.
Chairperson, allow me to join the queue of all those who have  congratulated
our president, the President of the ANC Women's League, Comrade Nosiviwe.  I
wish to say that your mandate is not only to lead  emancipated  ANC  Women's
League members, but also to lead women  from  other  political  parties  and
formations, like women  in  the  IFP  and  the  DA,  women  of  the  African
continent and women of the world.

I further congratulate the ANC Women's League on pronouncing  on  the  issue
of Amina Lawal of Nigeria. I want to assure you, Comrade President, that  as
branches of the Women's League we are also going to  act,  as  requested  by
the office of our President and the NEC of the Women's League, in  terms  of
condemning the conviction of Amina Lawal.

I am very honoured today to participate in a debate  which  aims  to  review
the challenges faced by South Africa and the  achievements  that  have  been
made in terms of making the lives of women better. Today  I  stand  here  in
this House pronouncing that I am a proud South African woman. I am  a  proud
South African woman because the South African Constitution clearly  promotes
and affirms nonsexism  and  nonracism.  It  promotes  unity,  democracy  and
prosperity.  South  Africa  is  a  signatory  of  most  of  the  progressive
international conventions, like Cedaw and the Beijing  Platform  for  Action
which aim to promote gender equality and equity globally.

I am a proud South African woman because the South African  Government,  led
by the ANC, has put in place structures aimed  at  affirming  nonsexism  and
gender equality - that is, the National Gender Machinery, which consists  of
the Women's Empowerment Unit whose  mandate  is  to  empower  women  in  the
political institutions and to  enhance  their  participation  in  democratic
government; the Office on the Status of Women, under the  presidency,  whose
mandate is to liaise with women in civil  society,  formulate  the  national
gender policy and ensure its implementation; and the  Commission  on  Gender
Equality, a chapter 9 institution, whose mandate is to promote  respect  for
gender equality and provide for the protection, development  and  attainment
of gender equality.

I am a proud South African woman because in Parliament two  committees  have
been established and  are  functioning  very  well,  namely  the  multiparty
women's caucus and the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of  Quality
of Life and Status of Women. They also promote gender equality  and  women's
empowerment in Parliament, in government  departments  and  in  the  private
sector.

I am a proud South African woman because the South  African  Government  has
promulgated different pieces of legislation which aim to make the  lives  of
its women more meaningful. A few of the many pieces of legislation  are  the
Maintenance Act, the Domestic Violence Act,  the  Recognition  of  Customary
Marriages Act, the  Sexual  Offences  Act,  the  Choice  on  Termination  of
Pregnancy Act.

I am a proud South African woman because our Government has put policies  in
place which have restored the dignity of women and Africans in general,  for
example, all corporations have to adhere to the black  economic  empowerment
policy. The onus now is on women and black people  to  establish  their  own
businesses, because  the  ANC-led  Government  has  ensured  that  corporate
boardrooms are opened to everyone through BEE.

Today we have Setas which have been established in order to  capacitate  and
enhance the skills of the citizenry of South Africa in different sectors.  I
am a proud South African woman because South Africa  as  a  country  salutes
its women on 9 August, that day having been declared a holiday  as  National
Women's Day. There are very few countries, if  any,  which  have  identified
special days for women. [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Hon Chair, hon Deputy Minister and hon  colleagues,  I  think
we, as the Government, have achieved quite a lot in nine years. It  must  go
on record that the ANC-led Government opened  the  doors  and  levelled  the
playing field.

The views expressed by the hon Deputy Minister and by other hon  members  do
indeed demonstrate  the  evolution  in  terms  of  the  accomplishments  and
emancipation of women in our country. Under the  present  democratic  order,
we have, in fact, also enunciated quite profoundly the challenges  we  still
face in respect of the promotion of  the  quality  of  life  and  status  of
women.

As the ANC we have remained intolerant of the subjugation of  women  in  all
forms. In many respects, for instance in sport - and in arts and  culture  -
men are still resistant to the quiet but certain encroachment  of  women  in
what  was  once  a  male-dominated   domain.   However,   while   men   have
traditionally written the script for women, so  to  speak,  we  have,  since
1994, begun to look at women's lives  through  gender-sensitive  lenses.  In
fact, through sporting and cultural expression women have begun to  announce
themselves.

In  the  sporting  arena  the  emergence  of  a  new  thinking  on   women's
participation in South Africa during the  1980s  constituted  a  break  from
earlier thinking when women's oppression was at the bottom of the  hierarchy
of oppressions, with national  liberation  taking  priority.  South  African
women have seized the moment to ensure that they are not left behind in  the
democratic South Africa.

Despite all forms  of  adversity,  women  have  gained  recognition  in  the
sporting fraternity, and here we think of Hestrie Cloete,  Ntombazana  Setu,
Natalie Du Toit and Ria Ledwaba. Other accomplishments include the  tracking
of women's achievements by the SA Sports Commission, the inclusion of  women
in the traditionally male-dominated indigenous games of  South  Africa,  and
the proposal for the inclusion of the federation, with  the  best  programme
that promoted the women participation category, in the  Presidential  Sports
Awards.

However, challenges remain, as the ANC feels that women's  sport  should  be
treated as a serious business. In addition,  there  is  a  serious  need  to
create more sports opportunities for women in rural areas and  also  in  the
informal settlements. We feel that a support programme for  female  athletes
and administrators should be put  in  place  for  those  involved  in  male-
dominated sports and that, through Teta, capacity-building programmes  could
be  started  with  assistance  from  the  Skills  Development  Fund.   Other
challenges include the lack of adequate sponsorship and media  support,  and
codes like netball being called a Cinderella sport, etc.

Yes, we do believe that  through  the  numerous  platforms  that  have  been
created women have succeeded in articulating a unity  of  purpose  that  was
fairly absent under the previous, discriminatory political order.

With regard to its own programmes, the Department of Arts, Culture,  Science
and Technology has demonstrated, through generous grants, its commitment  to
exposing our women, especially our rural women,  to  our  written  and  oral
traditions. In this respect, we are grateful for the  contribution  made  by
nightingales  such  as  Barbara  Masekela,  Miriam  Makeba,  Mimi   Coertse,
Sibongile Khumalo and the doyennes  of  literature  such  as  Miriam  Tladi,
Nadine Gordimer, Zoe Wicomb and Delia Khan.
We therefore have no doubt that South Africa's development  should  also  be
judged by how we advance the causes of women. In so doing, we  could  ensure
that those budding dancers, sculptors, singers, poets and  painters  in  our
townships and remote rural areas are exposed to the  work  of  the  cultural
icons. We should tap into  the  hitherto  hidden  talents  of  lesser  known
artists. Moreover, we should place the development of  these  traditions  at
the centre of our art, culture and heritage scene.

Other challenges include promoting understanding of the benefits of  writing
and reciting in our indigenous languages in order to help  our  women  carry
themselves with dignity and confidence,  and  that  copyright  laws,  public
lending rights and reproduction rights are indeed gender sensitive.

In conclusion, women in our country have  been  communicating  their  grief,
joy, knowledge and imagination through cultural  activities  over  the  past
three centuries. In the ANC we believe that debates like this one, in  which
I have been fortunate enough to participate, will ensure  its  survival  for
prosperity. Malibongwe igama lamakhosikazi!  [Praise  the  name  of  women.]
[Applause.]

Ms B THOMSON: Deputy Chairperson, Deputy Minister, hon members  and  special
delegates, we have now enjoyed almost 10 years of freedom  in  South  Africa
and, beyond any doubt, have laid the foundation to  deal  with  the  poverty
and other unjust practices that we inherited from the apartheid  government.
It is, therefore, time that we looked back to see what  we  have  done  with
regard to women and agriculture.

As correctly outlined in this year's January 8 statement by  our  President,
employment creation must be one of the central objectives  of  this  growing
economy, including a united action to push back the  frontiers  of  poverty.
The plan, among other things, will ensure quality  service  delivery,  build
investor confidence and foster food production  and  rural  development.  It
will also ensure the  creation  of  public  and  private  partnerships,  and
ensure sustainable development. The aforementioned are ongoing as they  also
apply to the future. So, they are challenges that always lie ahead.

A major accomplishment in the agricultural sector is the  implementation  of
the strategic plan in terms of which measurable objectives are outlined  and
key performance areas redefined to  ensure  and  guarantee  success  in  the
implementation. The plan was agreed to  between  Government  and  the  major
farmers' unions.

Cognisance should be taken  of  the  fact  that  women  are  headed  towards
leading the agricultural sector  in  our  country.  With  the  Minister  for
Agriculture and Land Affairs being a woman and her director-general  also  a
woman,  we  thus  have  gender-sensitive  programmes,  projects   and   such
wonderful achievements and accomplishments  in  the  national  Ministry  for
Agriculture.

This bodes well for and is in line with the resolution made in  the  Beijing
Declaration and Platform for Action. To support and encourage women  in  our
country, we have annual awards  for  outstanding  women  in  agriculture  in
which women, unlike in the olden days, are front-runners in  getting  things
done with regard to service delivery.

In the past nine years we have also noted the big shift in land  reform  and
gender policy, with women now being given security  and  equal  rights  with
men with regard to ownership, control and use of land.  The  Government  has
already started to pursue  a  programme  of  active  engagement  within  the
African  continent  by  using  Nepad's  Comprehensive   Africa   Agriculture
Development Programme and by using bilateral engagement as an entry point.

The challenge for agriculture in South Africa is to  become  more  inclusive
and  equitable,  while  at  the  same   time   improving   the   levels   of
competitiveness and profitability. This is also supported  by  the  outcomes
of  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  which  was  held   in
Johannesburg. This  summit  underpinned  the  need  to  achieve  our  growth
objectives while managing and using natural resources sustainably.
The farmer support and development programme was able to guide  and  support
previously disadvantaged farmers  and  afforded  them  equitable  access  to
resources for agricultural development,  which  included  financial  support
through  the  rapid  transformation  in  the  Land   Bank.   Of   particular
significance here was the inclusion  of  women's  developmental  initiatives
without any gender infringements.

The BEE strategy in the  agricultural  sector,  as  adopted  by  Government,
promoted and supported the participation of black people, women,  the  youth
and people with disabilities in agriculture. That situation resulted in  the
alleviation of poverty, job creation and improvement in their lives.  It  is
heartwarming to note that nationwide, that is in all nine provinces  of  our
country, it is now women who are the front-runners in these new  initiatives
brought about by this new democracy.

The  Government  succeeded   in   establishing   good   relations,   through
consultation, with the signing of the transfrontier conservation  agreements
with Mozambique and Zimbabwe. This is  an  initiative  where  the  countries
jointly conserve and manage the use  of  natural,  biological  and  cultural
resources in a sustainable  manner.  This  vision  gives  substance  to  the
objectives of  SADC  which  are  aimed  at  promoting  synergy  in  regional
initiatives  for  economic,  social  and  conservation   benefits   on   the
subcontinent.

Lastly, our Government legislated on the use of thicker plastic bags,  which
are suitable for recycling or reuse as the old ones  were  an  environmental
hazards and killed plants and animals.  Our  country  is  in  a  process  of
transition and is  grappling  head-on  with  the  transformation  of  gender
relations, and, as such, these are now our  challenges,  but  not  problems,
which have been translated into national priorities.

[We would like all our men at home and here in the House  to  know  that  we
love them and that we respect them. We ask them also to love and respect  us
and to help us against the scourge of violence  against  women.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, I first want to thank  all
the members who participated in this debate. I  would  also  like  to  thank
you, hon members, for allowing me to share my thoughts and  views  on  these
matters in this House, the NCOP.

I would just like to make three  quick  points.  Hon  Themba  mentioned  the
issue of  gender  focal  points  and  the  fact  that  these  do  not  exist
necessarily in all departments. But,  I  want  to  challenge  the  portfolio
committee  to  exercise  its  oversight  responsibility  by   engaging   the
departments concerned and engaging the Ministers to ensure that we  do  have
these  gender  focal  points  in  all  departments.  It  is,   indeed,   the
responsibility of the oversight committee to  seriously  engage  members  of
the executive on these matters.

Hon Ngcobo mentioned the issue of poverty, which is a  very  critical  issue
in our country and on the entire continent. I think it  is  good  that  this
issue should be raised in all the debates which we engage in, because if  we
have no appreciation of the nature of  the  ills  in  our  society,  in  our
country and on the continent,  and  that,  in  fact,  poverty  is  at  their
centre, then we would not have an appreciation of our programmes of  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty. It is my view that  we  need,  amongst  other
things, as members  of  Parliament,  to  assist  our  people  to  embark  on
programmes which can assist them to be self-sufficient, and also  to  assist
them to access social welfare grants from our Government.

Comrade Naledi mentioned  something  very  interesting,  the  issue  of  the
scoreboard, which I found very interesting. She particularly  mentioned  the
fact that at a social level, the drop-out rate  for  girls  at  schools  has
decreased. I think that that is something which we need to  pride  ourselves
on as a nation, because this  has  been  a  problem,  particularly  here  in
Africa, where you would have young girls dropping out of school  at  a  very
early age because of circumstances really beyond their control. And,  if  we
can decrease the drop-out rate of these  young  girls,  it  means  that  our
nation is  getting  somewhere.  It  means  that  we  are  going  to  have  a
generation of young women who can take over the reigns of power in  a  South
Africa that is even better than the one we live in now.

You also  mentioned  the  issue  of  customary  marriages,  and  I  want  to
challenge hon members, despite the fact that we pass all this good and  very
progressive legislation in this Parliament, how do we empower our  women  to
understand, appreciate and interpret some of  these  most  progressive  laws
which we pass in this House so that they can have  an  appreciation  of  how
they impact on their lives?  Do  they  impact  on  them  in  a  negative  or
positive way? How do we assist them? We talk about customary law,  customary
marriages and customary this and that, but how do we ensure  that  women  do
not get disadvantaged in the process; that even as we have these  laws  they
do not get cheated and are empowered to understand their rights within  that
customary marriage? That's the challenge  for  all  of  us  who  are  public
representatives.

The last issue that I would like to comment  on  is  an  issue  that  sounds
rhetorical and very poetic, but which I actually think is  very  good.  Mama
Nkonyeni kept on saying, ``I'm proud to be a South African woman; I'm  proud
to be a woman, just of my  womanhood.''  I  think  that  one  of  the  major
challenges we face as a country is that of instilling in our  children  that
sense of pride and patriotism. If you  listen  to  our  children  when  they
speak and to some of the things that they imitate because they watch  a  lot
of movies and play a  lot  of  these  play-station  games  and  so  on,  you
sometimes get a sense that you have a group of children who  are  likely  to
really lose focus, lose touch and appreciation of what we  here,  as  public
representatives, have been striving to get in South Africa.
Therefore it is important that as we bring our children  up,  we  instil  in
young girls this sense of pride that  they  should  be  proud  to  be  young
girls, and that they should be proud to be women. They should  be  empowered
and educated as girl children so that they can lead a future  South  Africa.
But, we also need to instil in both young boys  and  girls  this  spirit  of
patriotism, that ``I am a South African''. It is something that we  need  to
emphasise repeatedly and let it  be  rhetoric,  so  that  our  children  can
really appreciate where we come from, what the  future  has  for  them;  and
that, for this country to prosper, it depends  solely  on  them.  We  cannot
achieve that unless they develop pride in the country, that  is  the  spirit
of patriotism and the spirit of defending the gains  of  our  revolution  in
this country. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

               FINANCIAL AND FISCAL COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)
Dr E A CONROY: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister and colleagues,  the  Financial
and Fiscal Commission, or  the  FFC  for  short,  established  in  terms  of
section 220 of the Constitution, is a juristic  person.  It  is  independent
and  subject  only  to  the  Constitution  and  the  Financial  and   Fiscal
Commission  Act.  It  acts  as  a   consultative   body   for,   and   makes
recommendations and gives advice  to,  organs  of  state  in  the  national,
provincial and local spheres of government on fiscal and financial matters.

The FFC is part of a set of mechanisms for the establishment of  policy  and
the  balancing  of  countless  interests  of  a   modern,   democratic   and
progressive nation-state. It is also a key participant in the debate on  the
equitable sharing of national revenue, and it pursues this mission  in  such
a  way  that  relevant  stakeholders  cannot  at  any  point  question   its
independence or impartiality.

The FFC's key points of reference are, in the first  instance,  respect  for
the constitutional status of each sphere of government,  ensuring  that  the
letter and spirit  of  the  constitutional  principles  always  guide  these
recommendations; secondly, the Constitution's Bill of Rights which  mandates
the  provision  of  basic  services  to  all  citizens;  and,  lastly,   key
principles of good intergovernmental relations which have been  outlined  in
detail in the extensive quality research and  analysis  activities  for  the
facilitation of informed decisions.

The Financial and Fiscal Commission at all times studies  and  prepares  its
recommendations  on  the  basis  of  a  transparent   relationship   between
principles, stated  programme  objectives,  the  examination  of  facts  and
analytical proficiency.

The proposed Bill is the result of  constitutional  amendments  effected  at
the end of 2001 and signed into law on 14 December 2001. The need  for  this
Bill arose as a result of an  amendment  initiated  by  Parliament,  and  it
could could not be finalised in time for the 2002 parliamentary  year  given
the heavy legislative workload. The specific constitutional provision  could
only take effect after the Bill was enacted.

The Bill seeks to amend the Financial and Fiscal Commission Act of  1997  so
as to extend the functions of the FFC; to bring the number, and  appointment
procedure, of commission members in line with the Constitution,  as  amended
by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa  Second  Amendment  Act,
Act 61 of 2001, section 221, which reduced the number of  FFC  members  from
22 to nine and changed the  appointment  procedure  for  these  members;  to
alter certain procedures in respect of financial matters in order  to  bring
the proposed amendments to sections 24 and 26 of the FFC Act into line  with
the Public Finance Management Act of 1999; to provide for matters  connected
therewith; and  to  effect  certain  consequential  amendments  and  provide
transitional arrangements.

Clause 1  of  the  Bill  amends  section  3  of  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission Act by proposing the insertion of a provision which will  require
any organ of state which intends to assign  any  power  or  function  to  an
organ of state in another sphere of government to request the  FFC's  advice
on any financial implications of such an assignment.
In terms of the proposed amendment, an assignment has no legal  force  until
and unless the assigning organ of state has indicated to the commission  the
extent to which it has given consideration to the commission's advice.  Such
assignments always have an impact on  the  division  of  revenue  among  the
three spheres of government and often result in unfunded mandates.

It is therefore critical that the FFC always assess such assignments  before
they are effected and develop such capacity should  it  not  have  any.  Any
financial implications for the FFC will be  subject  to  the  normal  budget
allocation process, but the FFC could also  consider  charging  transferring
departments for such requests not anticipated at the time of the budget.

The  commission  until  now  consisted  of  a  chairperson  and   a   deputy
chairperson who may be full-time members,  nine  persons  nominated  by  the
executive councils of each of the nine provinces, two persons  nominated  by
Salga as representatives of  organised  local  government,  and  nine  other
persons.
The Bill proposes that the composition profile of the proposed nine  members
be a chairperson and a deputy  chairperson,  three  persons  selected  after
consulting the premiers from a list compiled in accordance with the  process
prescribed by national legislation, and two other persons.

This reduction in the  number  of  members  will  promote  greater  cohesion
within the FFC and enhance its responsibilities  of  making  recommendations
that inform intergovernmental policy-making processes,  while  avoiding  any
tendencies to  bias  such  advice  towards  an  individual  province  and/or
vertical government sphere.

At the briefing to the select committee, the question was posed whether  the
formula  of  appointment  of  FFC  commissioners  would  not  undermine  the
authority of the weaker provinces. The Treasury's response was that  as  the
FFC is  not  a  decision-making  body  and  only  makes  recommendations  to
Parliament and the executive, weaker provinces will  still  remain  free  to
raise  specific  instances  of  neglect  during  parliamentary  hearings  or
through the National Council of Provinces.

It is clear that the intention of  the  amendments  is  not  to  change  the
powers and/or functions of the FFC, but that the  purpose  of  the  Bill  is
merely to outline the process that has to  be  followed.  The  Bill  has  no
financial implications for the state.

In conclusion, I request the House, on behalf of  the  Select  Committee  on
Finance, to support the Bill with the amendments proposed  by  the  Treasury
on 19 August 2003. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I shall now  put  the  question
and the question is  that  the  Bill,  B21D-2003,  be  agreed  to.  As  this
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all delegation heads are present in the  Chamber  to
cast their provinces' votes. It  looks  as  if  they  are  all  present.  In
accordance with Rule 71, I shall first allow provinces  the  opportunity  to
make their declarations of vote if they so wish. There are none.

We shall now proceed to the voting on the  question.  I  shall  do  this  in
alphabetical order per province. Delegation heads must  please  indicate  to
the Chair whether they vote in  favour  of,  or  against,  or  abstain  from
voting. Eastern Cape?

Ms P C P MAJODINA: We vote in favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Free State?

Mr T S SETONA: We vote in favour.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Western Cape?

Ms S NTWANAMBI: Siyavuma. [We agree.]
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: All nine provinces voted in favour.  I
therefore declare the  Bill  agreed  to  in  terms  of  section  65  of  the
Constitution. [Applause.]

                       SPECIAL PENSIONS AMENDMENT BILL

               (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon.)

Mr M I MAKOELA: Hon Deputy Chairperson, this is a statement on  the  Special
Pensions Amendment Bill, Bill 35. It is with a  sense  of  occasion  that  I
speak on behalf of the  finance  committee  on  the  amendments  to  a  very
special and crucial piece of legislation which was originally passed in  the
national Parliament in November 1996.

Members will recall that the original Bill,  the  Special  Pensions  Act  of
1996, provided for the payment of  special  pensions  to  persons  or  their
eligible dependants who made sacrifices or served  the  public  interest  in
the course of establishing a nonracial democratic  constitutional  order  in
the Republic of South Africa.
These are the people who, as a result of their devotion to the struggle  for
a free and democratic South Africa, were prevented from providing for  their
own pensions. The implementation of this Act has had and continues  to  have
a significant impact on their lives and the lives of many  deserving  people
in the country.

In 1998 however, the  national  Parliament  adopted  an  amendment  to  this
legislation to improve the delivery  of  benefits  under  this  Act.  Today,
again, the national Parliament  is  expected  to  pass  a  second  round  of
amendments  to  this  piece  of  legislation   which   mainly   deals   with
administrative matters in order  to  facilitate  and  expedite  the  ongoing
implementation of the Act. It may as well be noted that, with  many  people,
it was through this pension only that they were  able  to  survive  and  are
still surviving.

The main objectives of this amending Bill  before  the  NCOP  today  are  as
follows. It is to allow  the  Special  Pensions  Board  to  acknowledge  and
receive late applications. This will open opportunities for all persons  who
meet the qualification criteria as prescribed by the Act, but were left  out
because of the cut-off date for submitting  applications.  In  other  words,
there are many potential beneficiaries  who  are  not  yet  on  the  Special
Pensions payroll. The Special Pensions Department has  set  up  a  dedicated
research unit whose task is to identify those people who ought  to  qualify.
Here we need to think about those people who died in  detention  and  others
who were, at the time, imprisoned.

We also learned that the Robben Island  Museum  is  working  on  a  detailed
register of everyone who came  through  their  doors  so  as  to  produce  a
comprehensive list of ex-political prisoners. We still do not have the  full
details of those who were in the camps and those who were in exile.

Secondly, to prescribe the quorum, the Bill deals with the  prescription  of
the quorum for any meeting of the board. The Act requires that the board  be
established with five members, but it does  not  provide  guidelines  as  to
what constitutes a quorum for purposes of regulating meetings of the board.
The Bill also removes the limitations  of  the  board's  existence  to  four
years after the commencement of the date of the  Act  and  to  validate  the
continued operation of the board. This is necessary since the board has  not
yet completed its activities. The board will cease to exist as  soon  as  it
has completed its activities.

The Bill removes the requirement that one member of the  review  board  must
be an actuary. This will save the cost of paying an actuary  to  sit  in  on
every  appeal  because  the  review  process  does  not  require   actuarial
expertise. The normal, three-year cycle, actuarial valuation of  the  entire
Special Pension Scheme,  like  any  other  pension  scheme,  will  still  be
performed. This is separate from the review  process  itself.  Further,  the
review board may seek actuarial advice on an ad hoc basis  if  and  whenever
it is necessary.

The Bill amends the definition  of  "military  service"  so  as  to  include
military  service  or  training  performed  or  undergone  in   the   former
nonstatutory forces, that  is,  the  military  forces  of  the  former  then
political organisations, as contemplated in the Special Pensions Act.

The current definition excludes persons who performed  military  service  or
undertook military training in the former nonstatutory forces, but  are  not
entitled to special pensions benefits.

Lastly, the Bill seeks to effect technical corrections and  to  provide  for
the retrospective effect of certain amendments so as to  ensure  the  smooth
running of the administration and the effective and efficient processing  of
applications for benefits. We may also bear in mind that this  Bill  is  not
the final amending Bill. Additional fine-tuning is required  and  this  Bill
before us is simply a  Bill  to  facilitate  the  workings  of  the  Special
Pensions Board in certain  matters  once  a  more  comprehensive  review  is
completed.

To those of us who have been waiting patiently for a long  time,  please  do
not despair because these amendments will offer measurable  relief  for  our
comrades. The Select Committee  on  Finance  endorses  the  amended  Special
Pensions Amendment Bill and calls on members of the NCOP to vote  in  favour
of this section 75 Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 16:17.
