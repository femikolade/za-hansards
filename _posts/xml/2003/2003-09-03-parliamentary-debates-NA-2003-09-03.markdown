ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

QUESTIONS AND REPLIES - see that book.

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, the first item on the Order Paper today  is
questions to Ministers in the Peace and Security Cluster. Before  we  start,
and since we have been away,  I  want  to  remind  members  that  the  Rules
provide that the supplementary question may not consist  of  more  than  one
question. I want to appeal to hon members to please  adhere  to  this  Rule,
because I don't want to stop you at the end of one. But I will do so.

Question 139 has been asked by hon Mr Ramgobin to the  Minister  of  Foreign
Affairs. The hon Minister of Foreign Affairs is  abroad  and  has  requested
that her questions stand over.

             ARMAMENTS CORPORATION OF SOUTH AFRICA LIMITED BILL

                           (Second Reading Debate)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Deputy Speaker, one of  the  responsibilities
that we carry is that of carefully taking charge  of  our  inheritance  from
history and to reshape that to better serve the interest of  the  people  of
our country in the period that lies ahead.  One  of  those  inheritances  is
Armscor, which was created at the height of apartheid. Armscor  was  created
in 1968. At  the  time,  it  had  three  major  functions.  These  were  the
development and manufacturing of armaments, the acquisition of armaments  on
behalf of the then SADF, and control over export  and  import  of  armaments
into or from the Republic.

With the ushering in of democracy in 1994, and the change in posture of  the
SANDF from an offensive to a defensive one, a number of measures were  taken
by the first democratic Government to restrict and contain the movement  and
supply of arms into and out  of  South  Africa.  Firstly,  the  development,
manufacturing and sales of armaments was transferred to a wholly  commercial
enterprise,  Denel.  Secondly,  control  over  conventional  armaments   was
transferred to the National Conventional Arms  Control  Committee.  Thirdly,
the creation of the Defence Secretariat  led  to  greater  civilian  control
over the acquisition process by the Department of Defence.

These changes led to  a  review  of  the  role,  functions  and  mandate  of
Armscor. The  new  Bill  was  drawn  up  in  consultation  with  four  other
government departments, the South African Aerospace,  Maritime  and  Defence
Industry  Association  and  the  Centre  for  Conflict  Resolution  at   the
University of Cape Town. The objectives were to meet  the  defence  matériel
requirements  of  the  department,  and  to  meet  the  defence   technology
research, development, analysis test  and  evaluation  requirements  of  the
department. Its function is to acquire defence matériel  on  behalf  of  the
department and to manage technology projects.

The affairs of Armscor  will  be  managed  and  controlled  by  a  board  of
directors. There are rules governing the chief executive officer, the  chief
financial  officer,  non-executive  board  members,   board   meetings   and
decisions. The Bill covers conflict of interest and possible punishment  for
failure by board members and employees to disclose. The Bill explains  where
the  corporation's  funds  must  come  from,  the  audit  of  its  financial
statements and a system for evaluating acquisitions.

Regulations will be made by the Minister in terms of the provisions  of  the
Bill for the location of Armscor, the conditions  and  restrictions  of  the
Board,  procedures  for  meetings  and  the  keeping  of  records,  security
clearance for  employees,  code  of  conduct  for  employees  and  grievance
procedures for employees.

The Bill spells out the position regarding delegations  by  the  board,  the
safeguarding of information, records, property  and  premises,  intellectual
property, laws that have to  be  repealed,  and  so  on.  The  Bill  further
stipulates that the state remains the sole shareholder  of  the  corporation
and that the Minister exercises ownership control on behalf of the state.

The redefining of the role of Armscor has not been an easy task.  A  balance
had to be found between limiting the activities  of  the  corporation  while
not suffocating the industry. There  were  particular  areas  of  difficulty
around reporting lines and  the  role  of  the  Defence  Secretary  and  the
acquisition division in the  Defence  Secretariat.  This  has  finally  been
worked out, helped by the active participation of the portfolio committee.

I would like to acknowledge the role of the  chairperson  of  the  committee
and to formally thank her on behalf of the Department of Defence and of  the
defence industry  as  a  whole  for  her  positive  contribution,  assisted,
naturally, by the members of the committee. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms T R MODISE: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, today we proudly  place
before this House the Armaments Corporation of South  Africa  Limited  Bill.
When Armscor was established in 1968, it was expected to  meet  the  defence
matériel requirements  of  the  apartheid  South  Africa.  As  the  Minister
stated, it was a development and production unit for that regime. It  bought
and sold equipment, components and information almost in a  James  Bond-like
fashion.

The coincidence of 1968 is also very interesting. We  know  that,  in  1968,
civil military relations took a dip.  We  know  that  what  little  civilian
oversight existed was certainly removed  then.  Defence  and  all  military-
related issues and matters disappeared from the public view.  The  structure
of the South African Defence Force changed. Since  the  dawn  of  democracy,
Armscor has undergone a  number  of  changes.  It  has  recruited  non-white
people into senior positions. It currently has its first-ever black CEO.  It
has an acceptable racially integrated board of directors, but it has yet  to
achieve a respectable gender balance.

Armscor, as the Minister said, has had to shed  a  number  of  its  original
functions. Denel has taken over the  marketing  and  manufacturing  side  of
things. Armscor no longer has to regulate the export and import  of  weapons
because  there  is  a  Cabinet  sub-committee,  the  NCACC,  which  is   now
responsible for this, subject to the NCACC Act,  which  requires  that  this
Parliament receive at least three types of reports.

The Bill before us  renews  Armscor's  mandate  and  should  facilitate  its
restructuring. It spells out the  functions  and  confirms  Armscor  as  the
acquisition arm of the Defence department. Armscor is required to  establish
a programme management system that supervises the tendering and  contractual
processes of the Department of Defence. Armscor is  the  department's  chief
quality  assurer  and  the  board  of  directors  must  necessarily  reflect
experience, expertise and interest, and ensure that  a  quality  service  is
rendered to the Department of Defence  and  all  other  related  departments
which Armscor might be required to service. It is  important  to  note  that
the Department of Defence does not lose its  internal  acquisition  function
for non-military procurement.

This Bill makes provision for Armscor to acquire defence matériel on  behalf
of other state organs and on behalf of other states  with  the  approval  of
the Minister of Defence. This also means that as  we  go  and  look  at  the
provisions of Nepad and a dream of an Africa that  is  at  peace,  Armscor's
role becomes even more fundamental. The enabling of Armscor to  procure  for
other states actually means that Armscor is  in  a  position  to  facilitate
regional integration, which is one of the basic tenets of Nepad.

This means that  we  can  then  dream  peacefully  about  a  SADC  that  has
integrated policies, equipment and  systems.  It  means  that  we  can  rest
assured that systems and equipment that we will be  using  in  South  Africa
will be of the same quality  as  those  used  by  Botswana,  Mozambique  and
Tanzania. This also means that South Africa, as a little superpower  in  the
Southern hemisphere, will begin  to  exploit  the  expertise  it  has.  When
Armscor procures on behalf of another state, it necessarily has  to  receive
commission. We hope that this commission  will  be  used  to  finance  other
projects that Armscor has, such as their black empowerment project  and  the
talent-scouting project, where they bring in little children and help them.

The fact that Armscor, through this Bill, is now enabled to expand a  little
bit on the commercial side means that we can look  forward  with  excitement
to what is going to come out of the  Simon's  Town  Dockyard.  Will  Armscor
manage the Simon's Town Dockyard better? We hope it will. We  hope  that  it
will also manage it at a profit. We hope that not only will we  be  able  to
manage to attract South African civilian vessels  for  maintenance  at  this
dockyard, but that we might be able to refit ships from neighbouring  states
using that dockyard.

Yesterday  they  informed  us  that  they  are  busy   exploiting   military
technology for civilian use. One of the things that they  are  using  is  to
ensure that tyres are reinforced in  such  a  way  that  we  can  have  less
accidents. They are also using Gerotek to retrain  taxi  drivers,  and  more
lives will be saved this way. This technology can then be exported to  other
SADC countries, of course, at a profit for Armscor  and  this  country.  The
ANC supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Madam Deputy Speaker, the  need  for  an  institution  with
high technical ability to assist the DOD in the defence  environment  should
be a well-established fact. Armscor, with the state as the only  shareholder
will, due to  this  Act,  continue  to  provide  the  defence  matériel  and
requirements of the department, and, more  importantly,  manage  all  issues
pertaining to the defence technology  requirements  of  the  department.  To
fulfil this role effectively, high priority should be placed  on  the  level
of expertise of the approximately 2000 employees in its  service,  of  which
480 employees hold a Masters  of  Engineering  degree,  with  451  engineers
employed.

Companies have been  formed  by  Armscor  to  fall  in  line  with  accepted
commercial practices and to meet existing  business  requirements.  In  this
regard, entities such as the Institute  for  Maritime  Technology,  Gerotek,
Protechnik, Alkantpan, to name but a few, has provided the bulk  of  funding
which Armscor  needs  to  be  sustainable.  In  addition  Armscor's  funding
problems are exacerbated by a transfer payment from  Government,  which  has
increased by a mere average annual rate of 5,3% for  the  past  five  years.
Considering the inflation rate of between 6% to 8%, this was a  decrease  in
real terms.

As stated in a briefing yesterday to the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Defence,
these funding problems have led to increased resignations particularly  from
engineers due to the fact that their salaries are not  market-related,  with
the  resulting  erosion  of  technical  capabilities.  Not  only  has  these
strategic defence packages caused an  increase  in  the  workload  of  these
engineers, but the funding problems have manifested itself in  an  inability
to transform the workforce.

The purpose of the  strategic  importance  of  Armscor  is  evident  in  the
conclusion of a public partnership agreement in terms of which Armscor  will
manage the Simon's Town naval dockyard. Not only will it be responsible  for
ensuring that the dockyard will be commercially viable, hopefully, but  will
also  be  responsible  for  the  disposal  of  excess  stock,  being  excess
equipment and ammunition from the Department of Defence.

While we are on this issue, it appears to be of great concern and  needs  to
be dealt with as effectively and speedily as possible;  in  fact,  urgently.
Failing to do so might lead to severe embarrassment to  the  Government  and
possible loss of life and property in the  event  of  excess  and  redundant
ammunition stocks not being dealt with effectively and timeously.

It is important to know that Armscor has  also  been  at  the  forefront  of
commercialising technologies which have been developed  in  the  past  years
relating to the so-called run-flat tyre  inserts,  portable  X-ray  machines
and containerised medical units. These attempts will  not  only  ensure  the
commercial viability of  Armscor,  hopefully,  but  will  also  ensure  that
society benefits from the commercialisation of equipment that was  initially
intended for  exclusive  use  by  the  military.  Attempts  to  address  the
transformation requirements of Armscor  is  evident  in  the  fact  that  it
intends employing an additional 47 engineers within the  next  three  years.
However, despite all of  the  above,  Armscor  is  strategically  poised  to
ensure the survivability of the local defence industry in South  Africa.  It
should do so with the greatest of care and consideration, not  only  to  the
major local defence industries, but also the smaller companies.

It is within this context that allegations have started to  surface  to  the
effect that  the  previous  Chief  of  Acquisitions  of  the  Department  of
Defence, Mr Chippy Shaik, now employed  by  a  company  dealing  in  defence
equipment, which I shall not name for  the  present  purpose,  is  allegedly
intimidating  employees  of  other  companies  not  to  tender  for  certain
contracts, and that in the event of them doing so he would ensure that  they
would not receive contracts from entities such as Armscor.

I mention this because,  in  light  of  these  allegations,  Armscor  should
ensure that practices of this nature, where it has the ability to  exhort  a
tremendous amount of influence over  the  local  defence  industry,  do  not
raise their ugly heads.

As you are well aware, we are currently  experiencing  the  consequences  of
such similar alleged actions with regards to the arms-deal scandal and  they
should not be allowed to prevail again.  In  light  of  the  above,  the  DA
supports the Armaments Corporation of South Africa  Limited  Bill.  I  thank
you, Madam Deputy Speaker.
Mr N S MIDDLETON: Mr Chairman and colleagues,  during  the  apartheid  years
the name Armscor conjured up visions  of  a  state-controlled  international
arms dealer, and perhaps smuggler, that was a  law  unto  itself  and  which
dominated the isolated sanctions that affected the South  African  armaments
industry.

It is not a subject of this debate to go into Armscor  history  too  deeply.
Suffice it to say that the closed and secretive nature of the  international
arms trading market was very much part and  parcel  of  Armscor's  corporate
culture during those days.

Of course the advent of democracy in 1994  changed  all  that  and  the  co-
operation of all functions of developing, manufacturing, and acquiring  arms
for the Government and controlling the imports  and  exports  of  arms  were
somewhat out of step with the current realities. This was particularly  true
after the formation of Denel  as  a  dedicated  arms  manufacturer  and  the
establishment of the National Conventional Arms Control  Committee  and  the
creation  of  civilian  acquisition  bodies   via   the   Civilian   Defence
Secretariat.

It was, therefore, no surprise that the  question  was  asked:  "Quo  vadis,
Armscor?" In response, the Minister of Defence  launched  a  review  of  the
future role of Armscor within a drastically changing environment.  The  Bill
before us, therefore, sets out a new and somewhat limited role for  Armscor.
The corporation will in future have two major objectives.  Firstly,  meeting
the defence matériel requirements of the Department of Defence  effectively,
efficiently and economically;  Secondly,  meeting  the  defence  technology,
research, development, analysis, tests and evaluation requirements.

The continued controversy over the South African arms procurement  deal  has
brought to us two crucial reminders about the nature  of  international  and
other arms deals. Firstly, there seems to  be  almost  unlimited  scope  and
opportunity for corruption; and secondly, secrecy and confidentiality  still
rule supreme to the detriment of openness and transparency.

This debate is not about the arms procurement deal and its controversy,  but
viewed against this background, it is clear that  the  Bill  would  have  to
spell out very clearly what  Armscor's  roles  and  functions  would  be  in
future. The IFP is satisfied that Armscor has a role to play in  future.  We
are also satisfied that the Bill creates adequate checks  and  balances  and
oversights. It will, of course, be up to this Parliament and its  successors
to ensure that these checks and balances are applied vigorously and  without
fear to ensure openness, transparency and accountability. For these  reasons
the IFP will support this Bill.

Mr J SCHIPPERS: Chairperson, after the  democratic  elections,  the  defence
establishment started a broad programme of transformation. This process  has
been the central feature of most military forces  in  response  to  the  new
post-Cold-War environment. The aims of transformation in  the  DOD  included
characteristics such  as  modern,  effective,  affordable,  accountable  and
appropriate defence capabilities. The  rationale  was  to  redesign  and  to
rightsize the SANDF.

The Bill provides for the continued existence of the  Armaments  Corporation
of South Africa. It provides for the functions, accountability  and  finance
of the corporation and also provides for the matters connected therewith.

Previously Armscor was also responsible for the importation and  exportation
of  weapons,  but  this  function  has  been  transferred  to  the  National
Conventional Arms Control Committee,  which  has  been  promulgated  in  the
NCACC Act. The Bill will enable Armscor to  restructure  itself  to  reflect
the new endeavours and ventures,  like  the  roles  played  by  Armscor  Pty
Limited and the Simon's Town naval dockyard.

All the  business  activities  conducted  by  Armscor  through  its  various
strategic facilities is to generate supplemental income. The Bill will  also
allow Armscor to fulfil its role to support  the  SANDF  in  its  increasing
role in peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations in  SADC  and  on  the
African continent. For Armscor to function  optimally  and  to  meet  future
challenges, its resource needs have to be addressed  urgently,  inter  alia,
renewing the Aids profile, reflecting the demographics of  the  country  and
keeping up with the international technology.

A few concerns were raised by the members of the committee in order  to  get
clarity. For example, will the PFMA and all the mechanisms be sufficient  to
ensure that the state's  investments  are  safe  and  secure  and  will  the
reserve fund be applied for marketing  research,  building  renovations  and
operating shortfall? Chairperson, the New NP  supports  the  Bill.  I  thank
you.

Mnr A BLAAS: Mnr die Voorsitter, die ACDP steun hierdie  wetsontwerp.  Weens
moontlike oorvleueling in die funksies van ander diensleweransiers  soos  in
klousule 3 bepaal, en finansiële reëlings soos in klousule  15  bepaal,  het
die wetsontwerp die  potensiaal  vir  konflik  tussen  die  Departement  van
Verdediging, die bedryf in die algemeen en Krygkor.

Krygkor sal hom moet bepaal by dié funksies wat, om welke redes ook al,  nie
doeltreffend deur ander leweransiers gelewer kan word  nie.  Krygkor  beskik
egter oor  unieke  kundigheid  en  bates  wat  hoofsaaklik  deur  die  staat
gefinansier word. Die bates moet op aanvraag aangewend  word,  nie  net  ter
ondersteuning van die nywerheid, die  Departement  van  Verdediging  en  die
staat nie, maar ook om inkomste vir Krygkor te genereer.  Dit  mag  nie  ten
koste van ander diensverskaffers wees nie, en moet primêr  gefokus  wees  op
die behoeftes van die  SA  Nasionale  Weermag  en  die  verdedigingsomgewing
binne die SAOG-konteks in die algemeen.

Die wetsontwerp verseker die voortbestaan van die unieke vermoë van  Krygkor
binne 'n bepaalde raamwerk ter ondersteuning van die  SA  Nasionale  Weermag
en die wapenbedryf in die SAOG in  die  algemeen  en  word  dus  as  sodanig
gesteun. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Mr Chairman, the ACDP  supports  this  Bill.  As  a  result  of
possible  overlapping  in  the  functions  of  other  service  providers  as
stipulated in clause 3, and financial regulations as  stipulated  in  clause
15, this Bill has the potential  for  conflict  between  the  Department  of
Defence, the industry in general, and Armscor.

Armscor will have  to  direct  itself  toward  those  functions  which,  for
whatever reason, can  not  be  delivered  efficiently  by  other  providers.
Armscor, however, has unique expertise and assets  at  its  disposal,  which
are mainly financed by the state. These assets should be applied on  demand,
not only to support the industry, the Department of Defence and  the  state,
but also to generate income for Armscor. This may not be at the  expense  of
other service providers and should primarily be focused on the needs of  the
SA National Defence Force  and  the  defence  environment  within  the  SADC
context in general.

The Bill ensures the continued existence of the unique capacity of  Armscor,
within a specific framework, in support of the  SA  National  Defence  Force
and the weapon industry in SADC in general, and is thus supported  as  such.
Thank you.]

Mr D M DLALI: Mr Chairperson, this Bill is  one  of  the  Bills  within  the
transformation process  of  the  Department  of  Defence  in  which  we  are
finalising the legislative process to make sure that the Defence  Force  and
its support structures are managed in a manner that the ANC  Government  can
achieve its transformation agenda and its goals.

This Bill seeks to address one of the core objectives  of  the  corporation,
namely  to  meet  the  defence  matériel  requirements  of  the   department
effectively, efficiently and economically. Having said the above,  the  lack
of transformation in this corporation is noted with great  concern.  Armscor
needs to move with great speed in the transformation process.  It  is  clear
that this is one of those institutions which are led  by  an  African  chief
executive officer and an African board member, but its body  structures  are
dominated by a white male workforce.
I hope that this Bill is going to  assist  in  the  acceleration  and  fast-
tracking of transformation in Armscor because of the  new  agreed  functions
of the corporation, particularly in view of the fact  that  we  have  agreed
that this  corporation  will  also  be  involved  in  marketing  of  defence
matériel  and  in  assisting  the  organs  of  state  in  defence  matériel,
including the SADC countries and the continent at large.

These resources will therefore impact on  Armscor's  funds,  assisting  with
the generation of revenue so that it can be sustainable  without  having  to
depend 100% on transfer payments from the  Department  of  Defence.  I  also
hope that this will assist its  efficient  processing.  I  am  raising  this
matter because Armscor is claiming that the lack of  transformation  in  its
institution is the result of a lack of funding.

The chief executive officer of Armscor, in his annual  report  for  2002-03,
said:


  Armscor's ageing and predominantly white workforce  makes  it  imperative
  for the  corporation  to  transform  and  renew  its  personnel  profile.
  However, this corporate goal has been frustrated by  inadequate  funding.
  To systematically transform and renew Armscor's workforce, a typical lead
  time of two or three years is required in order  to  transform  expertise
  from a current incumbent to  a  new  appointee  who  has  limited  or  no
  experience in the defence-related industry.

I therefore hope that the two-to-three-years target will be  met.  We  shall
monitor this target on transformation  very  closely  on  an  annual  basis.
We'll make sure that the chief executive  officer  is  accountable  for  its
wares and make its wares  transformable.  The  chief  executive  officer  of
Armscor made it clear that he is confident that this problem of  a  lack  of
transformation will be resolved by the next  financial  year.  I  hope  this
commitment is made clear.

The other issue raised by the Armscor report which  needs  urgent  attention
is the loss of capabilities within the SA National Defence Force.  Therefore
I also hope that this Bill will address  this  concern,  and  we'll  further
monitor how the corporation will address this matter. I also hope  that  the
next financial year is not going to bring the same problems again, and  that
these problems will have been addressed accordingly.

The commercialisation of Armscor has been one of the contentious issues  and
in the public hearings this matter was raised as a matter of  concern,  also
by the SA Aerospace, Maritime and  Defence  Industries  Association,  herein
referred to as AMD, and the industry would like to have  a  clear  assurance
that Armscor's commercial activity will not have conflicting interests  with
those in the commercial sector.

Since Armscor is 100% funded by the Department of Defence, the AMD  made  it
clear that Armscor is determining its commercial interests  and  the  manner
in which its revenue is collected. There should  be  no  conflict  with  the
interests  of  the  commercial   sector,   including   the   defence-related
industries. I therefore hope that these matters are going  to  be  addressed
by the corporation accordingly, and  that  there  will  be  no  conflict  of
interest within the defence-related industries, and  also  that  the  checks
and balances will be addressed accordingly.

The representivity within the corporation is of  great  concern  because  it
does not reflect  the  demographics  of  the  country,  particularly  within
defence itself. There are no women  at  all  in  managerial  positions.  All
general managers are males. In  particular  in  strategic  positions  it  is
worse because they are all white males. The African males  are  managers  in
human resources and  corporate  services  because  this  is  what  they  are
allowed to do. I'm raising this issue because it is becoming  a  trend  that
Africans are not found suitable for  IT,  finance,  corporate  services  and
acquisitions.

I hope these matters are  going  to  be  addressed  accordingly.  The  board
members of the corporation are again linked to this issue. It  seems  to  me
it's a boys' club. This must change as a matter of urgency. We cannot  allow
these issues to continue unattended. It is because it is business as  usual.
This Bill should assist in the process and we need to monitor  this  process
as a committee. The ANC supports this Bill. I thank you.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Well,  first  of  all,  I
would like to thank all the parties for their support for this  Bill.  I  do
need to say that this is not the end of the story. The passing of this  Bill
is not the end of the story about Armscor. We have  to  continue  to  engage
the task of further clarity on the role of Armscor. That is the one issue.

The second issue may perhaps be critical. I highlighted the fact that  there
are a number of outstanding issues that must receive the  attention  of  the
Minister. Of those issues I'd like to  highlight  two,  because  I  consider
that if Armscor is to play a role and serve the country, two issues must  be
prioritised and attended to urgently.

One is the issue of the security clearance of all the employees, because  it
is a highly security-involved institution. All  the  people  employed  there
must address this question of security  clearance.  The  experience  of  the
country has shown clearly the difficulties that can arise as a result.

Then, of course, linked to that is the question of the code of  conduct  for
employees. These two issues must receive  our  undivided  attention  if  the
institution is to serve the country properly.

I seriously take on board the issue of representivity on the  board,  and  I
noted that as the point was being made one of the members of the  Opposition
indicated that they would be ready to resign and to serve on  the  board.  I
shall consider this application. With those few words I'd like to thank  the
parties for supporting the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
    A REVIEW OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND
     STATUS OF WOMEN DURING THE FIRST DECADE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND OF THE
                          CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: Chairperson, hon  members,  there  were
times when I wondered whether it was the designed effect of chronology  that
the adoption of the Freedom Charter in Kliptown  and  the  historic  women's
march of August 1956 happened within a year of each other, during  a  period
that spanned  two  decades  of  the  intensification  of  mass  mobilisation
against the system of apartheid.

Of course, what has been certain has been the fact that by this time in  the
mid-1950s the role played by women in the struggle for  our  liberation  had
grown in significance. For  its  part,  the  1956  Congress  of  the  People
epitomised the essence  of  the  logical  conclusion  of  that  struggle  by
proclaiming, through the Freedom Charter, that all will be equal before  the
law; that in South Africa we envisaged that there  would  be  no  regard  to
sex, colour or creed in determining our place in society.

The battle cry, ``all shall be  equal"  became  the  premise  on  which  our
struggle was based, and it has had great significance  and  meaning  to  the
struggle for women's emancipation as  well.  Ordinary  South  African  women
from all walks of life, some  whose  names  the  struggle  has  engraved  in
granite, stood side by side for decades to advance the  cause  of  women.  I
would like to recall the names of our stalwarts that have since  passed  the
baton to us to see the struggle through.

We all remember the humility and the compassion for people of  leaders  such
as Albertina Sisulu, Gertrude  Shope,  Ruth  Mompati,  Helen  Joseph,  Amina
Cachalia and Winnie Mandela. Who could forget the bravery  of  Helen  Suzman
and Ellen Kuzwayo, and their determination to,  from  the  same  benches  on
which we sit in this House, champion the cause of women? To this day,  their
role continues to  demonstrate  that  South  Africa  cannot  wish  away  the
resilience of its mothers, the wisdom of its women and  the  love  that  all
these patriots had for their country.

Others have passed on, and we specifically remember the  recent  loss  of  a
member of this House, Comrade  Ntombi  Shope.  Robala  ka  kgotso  ngwanana.
[Rest in peace, girl.]

Wena Ntombi wakaMark, wakaWilliam,  oshay'  ibhuluemayini  wathi  ``voetsek,
ngizokunik' udade wenu". [You, the daughter of Mark William who beat a  boer
in the mines, saying: ``Voetsek, I will show you your sister.'']

Wena wa ra ka rikulu Ngwanzenyama, wa ka Ximukavukosi. [You,  of  the  great
Ngwanzenyama of Ximukavukosi.]

We pay  tribute  to  these  and  the  many  other  women  who  have  made  a
contribution  not  only  to  our  politics,  but  also  in  respect  of  the
maintenance of our culture, heritage, folk lore, education and  history.  To
these noble women and to the many unsung  heroes  on  whose  shoulders  they
stood in order to be tall, we offer our gratitude on behalf  of  the  nation
and of South African women in particular.

We need to thank our  leadership  in  this  institution  of  Parliament  for
making it possible for us to have this debate. As  hon  members  will  know,
our country recently celebrated  August  as  the  month  of  women.  In  its
conference that was symbolically concluded at the end  of  last  month,  the
ANC Women's League resolved to work for unity;  that,  even  as  we  take  a
glance at the achievements made in the past 10 years, we should  already  be
looking at what it is that women can do together to advance those gains  and
correct their shortcomings.

We are all for the intensification of the process of establishing a  women's
movement through which women can engage honestly on  matters  regarding  the
advancement of the struggle for women's emancipation.

So as we look back over the past 10 years, where do we start?  In  my  view,
we would not have done justice to this debate if we did  not  touch  on  the
issue of the role of women during the negotiation process in the  run-up  to
the establishment of a democratic order in our country. Not only  should  we
ululate at the fact that women played a  key  role  in  these  negotiations,
perhaps we should also stress that a great effort was made  to  ensure  that
all women speak with one voice.

So the call for the establishment of a women's movement that transcends  our
isolated political corners is neither impractical nor  unrealistic,  as  our
own experiences can attest. We believe  that  there  is  more  that  can  be
achieved by women working together. It is my view that if Helen  Suzman  and
Albertina Sisulu could walk different paths to achieve one  objective,  that
of the recognition and emancipation of women, then those of  us  who  remain
cannot shame them by abandoning such a cause.

We must also declare that South Africans cannot afford to be indifferent  to
the suffering of others, particularly of women  of  other  nations  here  in
Africa and globally. In this regard, I would like to reiterate the call  for
us to add our voice as a nation, as members of Parliament gathered here,  in
support of the growing pleas for the life of Amina Lawal, a young mother  of
31 years, who has been condemned to die by the  Sharia  courts  of  Nigeria.
The case of Amina  Lawal  and  millions  of  other  women  in  her  position
demonstrates the long and tedious road to eradicating all forms  of  women's
oppression, be they political,  economic,  national,  religious  or  in  the
guise of tradition.

We in the ANC have already launched  a  campaign  to  mobilise  the  nation,
particularly women, around Amina Lawal's case. We believe that  one  of  the
things that South African women should celebrate with the attainment of  our
democracy is the fact that they do not have to  be  subjected  to  the  same
treatment Amina Lawal is subjected to in her country; that in  this  country
the state will implement laws that regulate human conduct, in line with  the
constitutional order which we so painfully fought for, side by side.
Gone are the days when state security forces acted as self-appointed  police
of morality, who regulated and infringed on personal lives of  people  in  a
manner similar to what the Sharia courts are doing in Nigeria. For this  and
many other reasons, South African women have a lot to celebrate.

I now come to the coming of age  of  our  democracy.  I  must  be  quick  to
mention here, at the beginning, that whatever inroads we have  made  in  the
past 10 years, such inroads will not be substantial or qualitative  if  they
do not change the lives of ordinary women at the lowest level, in  the  most
remote corners of our country. I would, therefore, like us to  look  at  the
amount of progress made in turning around the lives of women, with  specific
reference to those in the rural areas.

We have heard reports that in the past 10 years more and more of our  people
who never had access to basic services such as water  and  electricity,  now
do have such access. We have also heard reports  that  these  services  have
not reached everyone, and that, in fact, the lives of the  majority  of  our
people have remained the same or gotten worse during the same period.

What we know, however, is that there are real stories about real people,  to
whom we can point and say, ``Here are women, in our community, who  used  to
wake up in the early hours of the morning to fetch firewood and  water,  and
that the electrification process has  now  improved  the  quality  of  their
lives". We have surely started to move away from the times when  women  were
reduced to being hewers of wood and drawers of water. And I  must  say  that
to those women to whom this change has come, it means a lot.

Of course, as a caring Government, we  cannot  afford  peaceful  sleep  when
there are many others who still go to sleep hungry and are subjected to  the
harshness brought about by the lack of progress in bringing  these  services
closer to them. If you were to talk  to  these  women,  however,  you  would
learn that they share our optimism and hope that  change  is  possible,  and
that it is certainly coming to them as well. This is because in the past  10
years they have seen many communities that were once in a same  position  as
them, that never had water, roads, electricity,  and  which  today  they  do
have.

It is true that others have noted that  our  effecting  of  the  concept  of
universal access to services has only resulted in communal  taps,  and  that
not everyone has clean water in their backyard. However,  in  that  communal
tap is dripping fresh, clean water. Of course, this is criticism  we  should
accept, but we should also recognise that in  the  meantime,  that  communal
tap is providing a community with clean, healthy water where there was  once
nothing.

The majority of our hon members here have  first-hand  experience  of  rural
life. They would know that when husbands and wives leave to work as  migrant
labourers  in  far-away   places   of   glitter,   such   as   Johannesburg,
communication with the spouses that remain at home becomes  very  difficult.
It took forever to  send,  through  the  post  office,  letters  and  urgent
messages about death or harvest in the family. Today,  this  Government  has
made it possible for telecommunication networks  to  reach  the  most  rural
corners of our country, and this has ensured  and  preserved  the  necessary
family contact.

Whereas some of our people in the rural areas  have  access  to  television,
the added benefit with the advent of democracy is that they  can  watch  all
their programmes, including the  news,  in  the  language  of  their  choice
because all 11 of them are used by the public broadcaster.

Many of us would like to forget the  days  when  women  died  whilst  giving
birth, and some as  result  of  back-street  abortion.  When  we  introduced
legislation that protected women and  passed  laws  on  reproductive  health
rights, we were given all sorts of labels. Today women enjoy the choice  and
right to decide about their bodies, and they  are  protected  and  empowered
with information that educates them in this regard.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: What about dead babies?

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF HOME AFFAIRS: The HIV/Aids pandemic continues  to  be
a thorn in the flesh of our public health system. We are not  going  to  win
this war until such time as women are empowered to exercise their  right  to
sexual choice and to be protected from abuse such as rape.  From  its  part,
Government has already poured vast resources into an awareness  campaign  to
address some of the salient factors  contributing  to  the  spread  of  this
disease, and this  is  now  going  to  be  complemented  by  a  well-planned
treatment plan, agreed upon by our Government. It might not be  enough,  but
I think we should commend Government for its efforts in providing relief  to
those who are left with the burden of caring for children orphaned by Aids.

The child support grant provided by social services  to  caregivers  goes  a
long way towards distinguishing us as a caring nation  where  ``every  child
is my child, and your child is our child".

It is my honest conviction that if we are to build  a  society  where  women
have the confidence and ability to contribute to life in  this  country,  we
need to take seriously the issue of education of the girl child. Again,  the
Freedom Charter declared that ``the doors of learning and culture  shall  be
opened".

We have already deployed resources to the education of our children and,  as
Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, I have  called  on  parents  to  allow  the
girls to go to school and not force them to enter into marriages at a  young
age. We need the support of this House in ensuring  that  children  are  put
first when deciding whether minors can wed or not.

Still on the issue of marriages, we have called on all women of our  country
to go to our Home Affairs offices to inspect the records  and  verify  their
marital status. This is because some of  our  women  are  reflected  in  our
records as being married, without their  knowledge,  owing  to  the  ongoing
scam of illegal marriages.

Women who are already married also need to  go  and  check  to  ensure  that
their  marriages  are  actually  registered  and  whether  their  status  is
correctly  reflected.  This  they  should  do  in  order  to  avoid  getting
surprises on separation or divorce, or when a husband dies.

Once more, I must conclude by saying that all the things we believe need  to
be done for the advancement of women's emancipation can only be done  if  we
are genuine about our intentions and if  all  women  put  their  differences
aside and work together. This is a challenge that I put  before  all  of  us
here this afternoon. I thank you, Madam Speaker. [Applause.]

Hon MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Ms J A SEMPLE: Chairperson, on behalf of the DA I would like  to  take  this
opportunity to congratulate the hon Deputy Minister of Home Affairs  on  her
election as President of the ANC Women's League. Congratulations to her  and
her committee. [Applause.]  Much  has  been  achieved  on  behalf  of  South
Africa's women during the first decade of  democracy.  It  is  a  well-known
fact that women make up 52% of the population, but did you know  that  there
are 1,7 million more women in South Africa than there are men?

In the latest edition of The South African Survey, published by  the  SAIRR,
is shown that African women form the majority group demographically in  this
country. In the past they have also been  the  most  marginalised.  This  is
because prior to 1994 black women suffered under the dual  burdens  of  race
and gender discrimination.

South African women in general have been discriminated  against  because  of
the patriarchal nature of our society. Many laws have  been  passed  in  the
past 10 years to improve the quality  and  status  of  life  of  women.  All
legislation that is passed now has to be gender sensitive. This  is  ensured
through  the  use  of  appropriate  language  and  by  ensuring   that   the
legislation in no way discriminates against women.

Our Constitution is the  prime  example  and  it  is  the  most  significant
legislation passed that  impacts  on  women.  The  equality  clause  of  the
Constitution in the Bill of Rights guarantees equal treatment for all  South
Africans. The state may not unfairly  discriminate  against  anyone  on  the
basis of race, gender, sex, pregnancy,  marital  status,  ethnic  or  social
origin.

The Constitution also provides that legislation be enacted  to  promote  the
attainment of quality as well as to  prevent  unfair  discrimination.  Other
examples of such legislation that have been passed since  1994  include  the
Divorce Courts Amendment Act, Act 65 of  1997.  This  Act  opened  the  then
black divorce courts to all  races,  giving  women  access  to  less  costly
divorce proceedings  and  making  it  easier  for  women  to  leave  abusive
marriages.

The South African Citizenship Act, Act 88 of 1995 said that citizenship  may
not be lost or gained due to marriage, giving effect  to  obligations  under
the Convention for the Elimination of all Forms  of  Discrimination  Against
Women.

The Births and Deaths Registration Amendment Act, Act 67 of  1997,   ensures
that a woman can keep her surname upon marriage or add her previous  surname
to  her  married  surname  without  applying  to  the  director-general  for
permission. Our Government can be complimented on passing some of  the  most
progressive legislation in the world, but often the implementation leaves  a
lot to be desired.

The Maintenance Act, for example, has been described by  Lawyers  for  Human
Rights lawyer, Danaline Fransman, as  mere  tourist  legislation.  It  looks
good and sounds good, but to most people it  is  just  good  on  paper.  The
Maintenance Act defines a legal duty that parents  owe  their  children  and
married people owe each other. For hundreds and thousands of South  Africans
this law makes a difference between having food and shelter and  not  having
any at all. The lack of resources, however, hampers its implementation.

The new Act came into effect in November 1999 and  includes  provisions  for
the appointment of maintenance officers to provide legal  support  to  those
who apply for maintenance. The Act also allows for  investigators  to  trace
defaulters, but the Department of Justice  has  not  yet  fully  implemented
this provision.

A pilot project launched earlier this year placed 55  trained  investigators
in select courts. But while the appointment of investigators  is  a  crucial
part of bringing that to fruition, many problems arise from the  first  day.
When individuals apply for maintenance, for example, application  forms  are
only available in English, despite the fact  that  many  applicants  do  not
speak English or are illiterate. Thus, there are still  many  challenges  to
be faced. We can be justly proud of the  progressive  legislation  that  has
been passed since 1994 to improve the quality and status  of  the  lives  of
women, but unless it can be implemented and enforced, it is  not  worth  the
paper it is written on. [Applause.]

Prof H NGUBANE: Chairperson and colleagues, I must begin  by  congratulating
Mrs Mapisa-Nqakula on her new position of leadership. We wish you  well  and
we  hope  you  shall  find  all  support  from  us  whenever  you  need  it.
[Applause.]
Let me also begin  by  reminding  this  House  that  at  the  World  Women's
Conference held in New  York  in  the  year  2000,  the  best  accolade  was
received by South African  women  regarding  the  place  of  women  in  this
country. The chair of the European Parliament informed the august  New  York
conference chamber about the sterling achievement that  South  Africa  women
had achieved, especially in view of our fledgling democracy.

He said that  South  Africa  had  managed  to  appoint  women  as  presiding
officers for both Houses of Parliament. This is an  achievement  that  is  a
rarity  even  in  the  most  advanced  and  older  democracies.  While  such
accolades speak for themselves,  I  would,  nevertheless,  like  to  mention
briefly the major examples of difference to quality of life that  have  been
brought about by having more women in our legislatures.

The presence of women in legislatures make a  quantitative  and  qualitative
difference in the type of legislation that is proposed and passed into  law.
There is evidence that the presence of women decision-makers does  influence
the outcome or even the issues debated, such as this one today.

Women bring different and more humane qualities  to  the  political  process
and, thus,  are  more  committed  to  women's  and  children's  rights.  Our
experience in South Africa has demonstrated that women  in  Parliament  have
advocated for and managed to obtain positive  outcomes  on  issues  such  as
public health, nutrition, equality in education and employment,  child  care
and other related family-friendly policies.

There has been a definite transformation within  Parliament.  Recesses  have
been aligned with school holidays. Gender-sensitive language is used in  the
drafting of legislation. Parliamentary sessions  now  commence  earlier  and
closer earlier than before 1994 to allow for more quality time  for  members
of Parliament and their children. The list is long and I have limited time.

Regarding the future, I believe the biggest  challenge  is  the  ability  to
attract more male activists who will speak with one  voice  with  women.  We
should not allow a situation to develop where men  feel  excluded  and  even
guilty. The programmes in our society need to be tackled  by  both  men  and
women who, after all, constitute the backbone of society.

South Africa has been lucky to have top  leadership  who  are  sensitive  to
women's issues. With regard to this, I would like to pay a  special  tribute
to my leader, Inkosi Mangosuthu Buthelezi. As women  in  the  IFP,  we  have
never felt the need to make demands for our interests, since the  leadership
has always put women first.

Some will remember that during the  Kempton  Park  negotiations  many  women
were dissatisfied because their parties had left them out. They had to  make
this demand loud and clear before they were heard. In the  IFP,  right  from
the beginning of negotiations, the hon Faith Gasha and  I  were  members  of
the negotiating team. Right now, here in this House,  IFP  women  constitute
30% of the party, despite the fact that the  IFP  is  a  small  party,  when
compared to the ruling party.

Some will also remember that there was an extremely offensive law  that  was
known as the Natal Code, produced by the colonial government  of  the  time.
This code denied African women all rights in that province  and  it  reduced
them to the status of children.

In the very first opportunity Inkosi Buthelezi had, he  repealed  the  Natal
Code. He protected women from the  various  forms  of  harassment  emanating
from the notorious section 10, which I am sure most of us remember.

It is necessary, from time to time, to acknowledge contributions  in  easing
the lives of the down-trodden, especially during the  most  difficult  times
of apartheid. It is in this spirit that I want  to  say:  Siyabonga,  Shenge
Sokalisa. [We thank you, Shenge Sokalisa.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! The hon C B  Johnson  will  be  making
her maiden speech.

Ms C B JOHNSON: Chairperson, hon members, may I too take  this  opportunity,
on behalf of the New NP, to warmly congratulate the hon Deputy  Minister  on
her election as president of the ANC Women's League. [Applause.]

Next year we will be celebrating our first decade of democracy. In 2003  the
preamble of the Women's Charter, which we adopted in April  1954,  is  still
as relevant as it was some 50 years ago. The preamble reads, and I quote:


  We, the women of South Africa ... hereby declare our aim of striving  for
  the removal of  all  laws,  regulations,  conventions  and  customs  that
  discriminate against us as women, and that deprive us in any way  of  our
  inherent right to the advantages, responsibilities and opportunities that
  society offers ...

Since 1994 we have made great progress towards  the  empowerment  of  women.
Not only does our Constitution guarantee our equality, but  it  continuously
commits us to striving towards a truly nonsexist and nonracial society.

There have been many achievements  and  accomplishments.  On  the  issue  of
gender representation, 20% of our judges and  28%  of  our  magistrates  are
female; 21% of our ambassadors and high commissioners  are  female;  24%  of
senior managers in the Public Service are female; and, best of all,  31%  of
the members of this House are female. But it  is  not  a  simple  matter  of
statistics and figures; the principle  of  equality  and  the  principle  of
empowerment must directly benefit the lives of women, and it has.

Since 1994, more women and their families, especially those in rural  areas,
have gained increased access to the provision of public service  and  public
health facilities. There has been increased  access  to  service  provision,
running water and electricity and, importantly, the  main  beneficiaries  of
Government's housing programmes have been  women  or  households  headed  by
women.

In  the  area  of  access  to  justice,  much  has  been  achieved  by   the
establishment of family courts, maintenance courts, and courts dealing  with
sexual offences.

But our commitment to equality extends beyond the borders  of  our  country.
Since 1994, South Africa has become an  international  participant  and  co-
signatory to, amongst others, the Dakar Platform and  the  Beijing  Platform
of Action for  Women,  as  well  as  the  SADC  Declaration  on  Gender  and
Development.

However, there are still  many  challenges  that  we  have  to  face.  Women
constitute 52% of South Africa's population.  Nearly  half  of  these  women
live in rural areas where job opportunities are scarce.  Twenty-one  percent
of adult women are still illiterate today, and 60% of households  headed  by
women live in poverty.

But the women of South Africa have shown, in the past as we do  today,  that
we do unite for what we believe in - the vision of  a  better  South  Africa
and a better tomorrow. Given this commitment  by  this  Government  and  the
women of South Africa, these challenges too will  and  can  be  overcome.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Ms J MOLOI: Hon Semple, we have all noticed that you look beautiful.

Chairperson and members, let me start by  congratulating  the  President  of
the ANC Women's League and I want to say to her that we  wish  her  all  the
best. [Applause.]

When this day  comes  it  usually  reminds  -  I'm  sure  almost  all  women
including myself - us of some of the harsh experiences that we  encountered.
It also reminds me of some harsh experiences that I had as a young girl.  In
the family in which I grew up, dominated by  boys,  everyone  loved  playing
soccer  so  much.  Like  all  of  them,  I  also   liked   playing   soccer.
Unfortunately for me, no one approved of  my  love  for  soccer  and  I  was
reminded from time to time that I was a woman and that  soccer  was  only  a
men's sport.

Funnily enough, the local soccer team would, reluctantly, call  me  to  join
them when they were running short of a member, and my own brothers would  be
the first ones to decline having me as their teammate. I must be honest,  my
mother did not like it either. It was worse with the community members,  who
would label me as a tomboy and many other things. Little did they know  that
we  would  be  having  Banyana  Banyana  as  the  national  women's   squad.
[Applause.]

Perhaps Banyana Banyana would have started long ago. Unfortunately,  because
of the societal stereotypes that women cannot  do  this  and  that,  it  was
delayed. Most women died before they  could  realise  their  potential,  and
others displayed only half of their potential while most  struggled  to  put
across what they were capable of doing.

If most women could share the experiences of the difficulties  they  had  in
society by virtue of being a woman, we would all  agree  that  as  women  we
have come a long way to where we are, thanks to our Government which  opened
up doors for women through the development  of  all  progressive  laws  that
provides an enabling environment for women. When we look back over the  past
decade of our democratic governance there can be little doubt that  we  have
scored major  victories  in  terms  of  advancement  of  gender  rights  and
equality in South Africa.  The  date  27  April  1994  liberated  all  South
Africans, both black and white,  from  the  bondage  of  discrimination  and
subjugation. But, in the case of women, it brought liberation of  a  special
kind.

Throughout  the  centuries,  South  African  women  suffered  the  brunt  of
hardship and oppression. It is often said  that  South  African  women  were
victims of triple oppression because of their race, class and gender.  Rural
women in particular were not only denied the  most  basic  political  rights
but were relegated to the outer fringes of economic and social  development.
Their lack of access to health and social services, the  complete  ignorance
of their educational and training needs and the poverty of  opportunity  for
development have left deep scars on our society.

At the same time, we must pay homage  to  the  women  who  remained  at  the
forefront of the struggle for emancipation and fundamental dignity,  freedom
from colonialism, sexism and racism that we have emerged from  victoriously.
Indeed, we have made  significant  progress  in  the  past  decade.  It's  a
tribute to the perseverance  and  tenacity,  and  also  to  the  vision  and
foresight, of South African women.

However, as we celebrate the significant advances that we  have  made  since
1994, we must also agree with each other that all the battles have  not  yet
been decisively won. Stripped of all the niceties, we  should  realise  that
the struggle for gender equality  is  in  essence  a  struggle  about  power
relations. Unfortunately, too many women in  South  Africa  have  won  their
basic rights on paper, in terms of our  much-admired  Constitution,  but  in
practice,  they  have  not  been  emancipated  because  of   unequal   power
relations.

The major challenge facing us in the coming decade will be to address  these
issues, which are still ingrained in our society in the guises of  religious
beliefs and  traditional  customs.  We  have  to  confront  the  deep-seated
stereotype that men are there to dominate society and to take decisions  for
and on behalf of women. We have to challenge the last remaining vestiges  of
patriarchy, where women are often regarded as mere  objects.  Unfortunately,
this line of thinking is often manifested in public. We see it in  the  high
incidents of rape and assault on women and girl-children, in  spousal  abuse
within relationships. We hear it in the  abusive  way  in  which  women  are
often still referred to.

As we progress through this first decade of the  African  century,  we  must
recommit ourselves to a  wide  array  of  issues  that  affect  all  of  us,
especially the women of our country and continent.

At the root of this is the issue of poverty and its  devastating  impact  on
our  society.  Most  of  the  other  issues  that  occupy  our  minds,  from
malnutrition to diseases, illiteracy to homelessness,  can  all  be  brought
back to the central issue of poverty. It is for this reason that so many  of
the government programmes and legislation introduced over  the  past  decade
to facilitate gender equity has focused on  the  central  issue  of  poverty
alleviation. If we want to make a difference in the lives  of  the  majority
of  South  Africans,  we  should  all  wholeheartedly   support   government
programmes and actions designed to address the issue of poverty,  especially
in the rural areas.

The  ANC  has  correctly  identified  the  fact  that   the   struggle   for
transformation of society will never be complete unless women,  as  part  of
the society, are liberated. We therefore do  not  envisage  a  situation  in
which a certain sector of society is free while the other  sector  is  still
in bondage. As the ANC, we are serious when we say we are against all  forms
of oppression, be it racial or gender oppression,  with  specific  reference
to women who are at the receiving end at present.

We can look around the African continent for work done  by  women  in  their
attempt to build sustainable peace:  For  instance,  in  East  Timor,  women
created collectives to provide one  another  with  emotional  support.  They
established employment schemes to keep their families  and  villages  going.
They instituted literacy classes and,  at  the  end  of  the  war,  demanded
political elections.

In Sudan, women from  the  North  and  the  South  took  initiatives.  [Time

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Mr Chair,  the  increasing  influence  of  women  on  our
society is a clear indication that our  democracy  is  maturing  at  a  fast
pace. The social security of women is growing, and many  have  access  to  a
number of grants provided by the state. However, the challenges  that  women
face  are  still  great.  Although  there  is  a  steady   growth   in   the
entrepreneurial capacity of women, more public platforms need to be  created
to showcase women as role models and mentors to future generations.

In certain  parts  of  Africa,  women  are  still  treated  as  second-class
citizens. South Africa must continue to pave the way to  ensure  that  women
enjoy public respect and moral esteem so that no woman has to  suffer  under
unjust and oppressive customary laws or belief systems.

The bold step taken by  President  Mbeki  to  speak  out  against  Nigeria's
inability to protect a women against an oppressive law, must  be  applauded.
All South Africans must hear this message, especially those  who  criminally
abuse and sexually violate the sanctity of women.

Although  we  celebrate  our  democracy,  there  are   certain   pieces   of
legislation and international agreements that  the  ACDP  did  not  support,
owing to their  destructive  nature  towards  the  very  core  of  families.
Violence against women is a direct violation of the family unit. The  family
ought to provide respite and a sanctuary for its members. Women are  central
to the proper functioning of the family. When there is  abuse  and  violence
against women, either publicly or in the home, the value of the family  unit
is threatened. Where this  occurs,  our  social  foundations,  such  as  the
community and its public responsibility, stand to disintegrate.

The ACDP believes that if we want to contribute to the  effective  wellbeing
of  women,  the  need  for  stronger  family-based   legislation   must   be
introduced. The road ahead for  women  is  positive,  however,  we  need  to
enforce current legislation to root  out  crime,  corruption,  victimisation
and violence in our communities. The role  of  women,  in  this  regard,  is
equally powerful. As women we can hold the power of peace  in  our  society,
if we would only apply the will to do so.

Ms N C NKABINDE: Deputy Chair and hon members, ten years into our  democracy
a  cursory  glance  at  the  statistics  for  unemployment,  poverty,  Aids,
illiteracy, salaries and even  political  representation  will  reveal  that
across the board women are facing the brunt of suffering.
We would be fooling ourselves if we do not acknowledge that these  realities
point to an ingrained system of subjugating women to  an  inferior  role  in
society. Yes, there are many individual success stories for  women,  but  by
their very nature these successes point to the  harsh  reality,  because  we
celebrate success where it should be the norm, but it is  not.  On  average,
women, though representing the majority in this country, are  still  lagging
far behind their male counterparts  in  every  considerable  measurement  of
development and participation in our society.

We need to salute the many men who  have  campaigned  for  gender  equality.
Certainly we should not  accuse  the  entire  male  population  of  actively
undermining equality. However, this does not change the inequality  that  is
currently an established feature of our society. It is a reality  rooted  in
the patriarchy that prevails in many South African institutions. Nowhere  is
this patriarchy more manifestly witnessed than in the staggering high  rates
of violence and crime committed against women. Thousands upon  thousands  of
women are annually murdered, raped and abused, often by men known to them.

It is of extreme concern to the UDM that it appears that  these  crimes  are
steadily on the increase. We should not underestimate  the  extent  of  this
problem. It is an insidious attack on democracy and makes a mockery  of  our
celebration of freedom.

We cannot speak glowingly of freedom when half the population are  prisoners
of fear; fear of being oppressed,  fear  of  being  abused,  fear  of  being
violated and fear of being killed. If we  are  to  establish  anything  here
today, it should be that, when we celebrate the second  decade  of  freedom,
we must be able to say that women have at long last achieved the social  and
economic freedom and equality that is  guaranteed  under  the  Constitution.
[Applause.]

[Ms M A SEECO: Hon members present, the UCDP says  that  women  should  give
the men the respect that they deserve. From time  immemorial,  the  man  has
been the head of the family. We should love the men, respect  them,  discuss
with them and be patient with them.]

In 1994 South Africa improved its position from 141st to 7th in  so  far  as
female representation is concerned. The experience of  South  African  women
and the role they played in the various capacities  during  our  process  of
democratisation are invaluable. There are  provinces  that  have  made  some
strides with regard to the employment of women on management level.

Women  are  primarily  responsible  for  maintaining   the   household   and
community. There should be  no  categorisation  of  jobs  on  the  basis  of
gender, nor should gender stereotypes determine  the  work  that  women  do.
Women achieve success in the work they do in the home, in the workplace  and
in the community.

Regarding women's health, the late  Leah  Mangope  strongly  felt  that  ...
mmaya botsetsi ... [midwives]

... should be informally trained to  assist  women  in  the  community  with
deliveries. The development of the potential of our women  will  enrich  and
benefit the whole society.

In terms of the economy, empowerment of women and equity in  the  workplace,
as mothers, we have to build a future for our children.

Mmangwana o tshwara thipa ka fa bogaleng. [A real mother is one  who  stands
up for her child.]

Let each of us find a way to empower, educate and uplift our women  and  our
people. Use  your  social  or  financial  success  to  uplift  your  people,
particularly the women. Women have to face challenges  in  the  present  day
... [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the Beijing  Conference  in  1995  stressed  the
empowerment of women as one of the central developmental goals of  the  21st
century.  It  adopted  a  programme  of  action   which   called   for   the
mainstreaming of a gender perspective  in  the  design,  implementation  and
monitoring  of  all  policies  and   programmes,   including   developmental
programmes. It committed countries to design their own  specific  programmes
and activities in  consultation  with  women's  groups  and  other  NGOs  to
implement the Beijing Platform of Action.

Women in South Africa continue  to  face  enormous  obstacles.  The  growing
recognition of their contribution  has  not  translated  into  significantly
improved access to resources or  increased  decision-making  power,  neither
has the dynamism that women display in the  economic,  cultural  and  social
lives of their communities, through the association and  informal  networks,
been channelled into creating new models of participation and leadership.

Beyond such political challenges, the material conditions under  which  most
African women live and work continue to deteriorate in  many  parts  of  our
country due to economic and social decline and the  spread  of  Aids.  Women
constitute the majority of the poor and the illiterate  in  both  urban  and
rural areas. Many young women between the  ages  of  15  and  25  have  been
pushed into sex work and face the risk of HIV/Aids infection.

Food security in South  Africa  cannot  be  assured  without  improving  the
situation of women producers. Women have shown themselves  to  be  ready  to
take advantage of new opportunities. Unfortunately, some  of  the  obstacles
that women farmers confront have been worsened by the impact of Gear.

For women, inadequate potable water, sanitation and waste disposal in  urban
and rural areas in our country leave populations  vulnerable  to  waterborne
and other environmental diseases. Malaria  and  other  respiratory  diseases
are still major killers in Africa. This country must wipe off the legacy  of
oppression that we have inherited. Only by developing our womenfolk, can  we
develop the whole nation.

Rev A D GOOSEN: Chairperson, the struggle for gender equality is a  struggle
for human rights and social change. We find ourselves in a situation  where,
because of our past, we are  saddled  with  the  sad  phenomenon  of  gender
inequality, which is still a reality, even in our time and age.

We  must  recognise  that  apartheid,  with  its  repressive   customs   and
traditions, have disempowered women to such an extent that it  will  take  a
long time to reverse the state of affairs. We find that women were  regarded
as minors, even in a marital relationship.

The Bill of Rights is very specific on achieving  gender  equality  and  the
inalienable rights of all women. It is,  therefore,  within  this  framework
that both men and women must participate in gender emancipation efforts.  We
must recognise that in order to coexist, we need to recognise  each  other's
worth as human beings and realise that we are all equal and  that  there  is
no such thing as one being superior to the other.

The patriarchal society and its systems  inculcated  these  wrong  attitudes
towards each other between men and women. Men, in particular,  must  try  to
make an attitudinal change towards  women.  These  wrong  attitudes  can  be
found in the workplace. Women are  regarded  as  the  weaker  sex  and  they
therefore do not qualify to do certain jobs. Women have shown that they  are
not inferior to anybody and that they can  compete  with  men  on  an  equal
basis in any work situation.

Whilst Government  has  done  so  much  to  address  the  gender  issue,  by
streamlining it into its programmes, there is still a lot that needs  to  be
done by society as a whole. Both men and women  need  to  be  sensitised  to
gender relations. To co-operate with one  another  on  this  very  important
issue, what we need is an actual  change  of  attitude  in  society  of  men
toward all women in South Africa.  We  need  this  change  of  heart  simply
because women cannot finish the task of emancipation and  social  change  on
their own. It is a corporate responsibility.

It is true that women have been struggling for their rights for many  years,
and they have accomplished a lot and gained much ground. But they  have  not
yet attained  the  ultimate  in  gender  equality.  The  struggle  therefore
continues and men must be drawn into the picture more and more,  because  we
have a responsibility in this regard, and if we continue  to  turn  a  blind
eye to gender inequality  it  will  only  be  detrimental  to  us  as  South
Africans in the long run.

Because women are not a homogeneous group, they  need  different  levels  of
empowerment and interventions  to  make  them  conscious  of  the  situation
society has put them in. For instance, women in rural areas would  want  the
quality of their lives to be improved by  way  of  the  improvement  of  the
infrastructure in the areas in which they reside.
This is an area where local government can play a meaningful role  in  terms
of service delivery. It is when, for instance,  they  have  their  right  to
water and sanitation recognised that it would greatly eradicate some of  the
discomfort and hardships which women have to endure day by day. The need  in
urban areas might be totally different.  There it would involve issues  like
skills development and putting them in a better position to compete  on  the
open labour market.

Women must realise that they are the masters of their own destiny  and  that
no man, no person, has the right to determine what they ought to be and  can
be. Men, on the other hand, must be sensitised to this  new  life  to  which
women can aspire, without seeing them as a threat to their  own  livelihood.
This will go a long way to closing the gap of gender equality.

At the march in Pretoria in 1956, the women  of  South  Africa  proved  that
they could take their destiny into  their  own  hands  by  displaying  their
contempt for the pass laws. We salute the women  of  South  Africa  for  the
courage they have displayed, even when the odds were stacked  against  them,
in fighting for their rights.

They must be celebrated as the nurturers of the vulnerable  in  society,  as
well as the first teachers in our communities. It is no fallacy that if  you
educate a woman, you educate  a  nation.  It  goes  without  saying  that  a
country's development can only be  as  strong  as  the  empowerment  of  its
womenfolk.

As we as South Africans aspire towards hitting the high road of  development
and competing on an equal footing with other countries and their  economies,
we need to bear in mind that the women in our society  and  in  our  country
must be at the forefront of that development. Can we then  disregard  gender
equality as the basis for a flourishing economy? Most certainly not.

Government has done a lot to address the plight of women, and since  1994  a
great deal has been  achieved.  Women  are  in  positions  of  authority  in
Government, in the Public Service and in Parliament. Thirty per cent of  our
Ministers are women and eight women are Deputy Ministers.  There  are  women
occupying high positions in all walks of life; they are Speakers,  premiers,
mayors, DGs and DDGs in medicine, in education, in agriculture, even in  the
judiciary, in the navy and in the army. So, you find women in all  walks  of
life and they need not stand back for anybody in attaining what  they  think
is best for them as womenfolk.

All is not rosy, for there are still many open spaces. So, in spite of  this
country coming a long way, there is still a  lot  that  needs  to  be  done,
because we have not attained the ultimate as gender equality  is  concerned.
Government departments, the private sector,  labour  organisations  and  the
Department of Labour must  ensure  that  leadership  positions  are  awarded
equally to both men and women.

Women, and mostly rural women, are amongst the poorest in the country.  This
is a  situation  that  needs  to  be  addressed  in  the  form  of  informal
education. Literacy projects need to be undertaken regarding the  poor,  the
rural  and  the  unemployed.  Government  is  leading  the  process  in  the
empowerment of women, and the rest of society must follow suit.

We salute the women of South Africa for their steadfastness,  their  courage
and the dignity which they have shown even  in  difficult  situations.  They
are indeed in need of the support of all  men  in  South  Africa  to  attain
gender equality. This is the way to  go.  It  is  the  right  thing  to  do.
Malibongwe! [Praise!] [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chair. May I also take  this  opportunity
to  congratulate  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Home  Affairs  on  winning  the
presidency seat of the ANC Women's League. [Applause.]  Remember,  you  will
always have our support. May I also compliment hon C Johnson on  her  maiden
speech. Well done.

Deputy Chair, the accomplishments of 10 years in respect  of  the  life  and
status of women have to be viewed in many ways. The question  is:  Have  the
women of South Africa really accomplished their aims regarding their  degree
of participation in  the  various  forums  of  decision-making?  Yes,  to  a
certain degree, but there is still a long way to go to achieve their goals.

They say in politics, "If you want anything, ask a  man.  But  if  you  want
anything done,  ask  a  woman."  [Interjections.]  So,  without  the  active
participation of women and the incorporation  of  women  at  all  levels  of
decision-making, the goals of equality,  development  and  peace  cannot  be
achieved. The presence of women is not enough. It has to be  women  who  can
make an impact.

Some of the countries with a  higher  percentage  of  women  representatives
have achieved a great deal through the use of the  quota  system.  In  South
Africa the high proportion of women MPs is  largely  a  result  of  the  ANC
adopting a one-third quota on its  list.  [Applause.]  And  the  MF  proudly
followed their system.

The challenges that lie ahead are great, especially with  poverty,  HIV  and
Aids, also  regarding  the  responsibilities  of  domestic  involvement  and
family commitment.

Since 1994, the participation  of  women  in  the  public  sphere  has  been
greatly enhanced.  Taking  into  consideration  the  representation  in  our
Parliament, in Cabinet and in the NCOP, etc, the women of South  Africa  are
hoping and aiming for a 50% representation  at  all  levels  in  the  coming
elections, to meet the challenges that lie ahead.

We, the women of South Africa, call on all abusers of women and children  to
stop now. Thank you.

Mrs S V KALYAN: Deputy Chairperson, the World  Organisation  of  Parliaments
resolutely affirmed in 1997 that the achievement of democracy presupposes  a
genuine partnership between men and women in the conduct of the  affairs  of
the society in which they work, in  equality  and  joint  mutual  enrichment
from their differences.

But regrettably, a decade later, in South Africa, women  are  still  treated
as vulnerable groups that require special treatment. It is as  though  women
have not left the starting blocks yet  in  respect  of  their  status.  They
still have to fight every inch, every point, to preserve their  identity  as
women and yet be equal to men.

According to the African Gender and Development Index, HIV/Aids  is  perhaps
the greatest single threat to gender equality to date. In fact,  where  Aids
is concerned, gender inequality is lethal. In Barcelona,  in  2002,  it  was
stated that 58% of women were living with HIV/Aids, and that  the  women  of
Africa appeared to be most affected. One in nine  South  Africans  are  HIV-
positive.

There are many contributory factors,  like  a  lower  socioeconomic  status,
discriminatory  cultural  practices  and  increased  occurrences  of  sexual
violence, which contribute to the higher risk of infection, and which  could
easily be addressed.

But instead  of  finding  practical  solutions,  the  Department  of  Health
developed an HIV/Aids strategic plan. Is  the  plan  gender  sensitive?  No.
Does it address gender inequalities? [Interjections.]  No.  Read  the  plan,
familiarise yourselves with it. Women's rights are  only  mentioned  in  the
plan in relation to sex workers and  survivors  of  sexual  assault.  Social
cultural practices that impact on women's  vulnerability  to  Aids  are  not
addressed.

There is a marked absence of gendered information on HIV/Aids. There  is  no
plan on  the  provision  of  antiretroviral  drugs  in  the  public  sector.
HIV/Aids services have not  yet  been  fully  integrated  into  reproductive
health services, owing to a lack of information, lack of skills, high  staff
turnover and general lack of capacity in  the  Department  of  Health.  This
aspect is a real tragedy, because South Africa has been at the forefront  in
guaranteeing  women's  reproductive  freedom  and  their  right   to   free,
reproductive health care.

There has been a deafening silence from the political leadership in  respect
of gendered messages addressing gender inequities. A case in point is  South
Africa's ambassador to Indonesia, who was found guilty in December  2001  on
21 counts of sexual harassment. He has another charge against  him,  but  he
is still at work. It is an absolute disgrace.  I  cannot  begin  to  imagine
what kind of message  this  is  sending  to  the  international  arena.  The
message I get is that it is okay to be a sex pest at work and demean  women.
Swift treatment of the vile culprit will send out the correct message.

There is a danger that the demographic skewing of gender as a result of  the
HIV/Aids pandemic may result in the voice of women getting fainter. We  know
how to do VCT, we know that vertical transmission can be reduced by the  use
of Nevirapine and we know  that  by  pooling  our  knowledge  and  resources
collectively the pandemic can be turned around.

However, implementation, ten years down the line, has been slow and  uneven.
We have to face many challenges. In conclusion, I would like  to  leave  you
with the words of my leader, hon Tony  Leon  ...  [Interjections.]  ...  who
said:


  A particular mark that has distinguished successful  countries  over  the
  centuries is their treatment of women. The better women are treated,  the
  more the nation advances. Women are the hidden key to  the  treasures  of
  civilisation, and humanity can only progress if women are  given  rights,
  opportunities and equality.

I hope that we will all work collectively to achieve  this,  and  avoid  the
"ag, shame" syndrome that many people buy into  when  it  comes  to  women's
rights. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, colleagues  and  hon
members, there is no doubt that the quality of life and the status of  women
in South Africa is today overall far better than it was in  1994,  when  the
ANC-led Government came into power.

This has been achieved because of the vision that the ANC has had,  even  as
far back as the time  of  the  Freedom  Charter  and  also  because  of  the
approach of the  ANC  with  regard  to  promoting  gender  equality  in  our
society. Economic empowerment is not an isolated activity, but is linked  to
the broader empowerment of women in  our  society.  This  has  already  been
mentioned by other members. Just having women comprise  31%  of  members  of
Parliament and MPLs has resulted in a completely different  environment  and
culture in all our legislatures.

The laws that have been passed have been  far  more  gender  sensitive,  and
specific pieces of legislation that promote gender equality and  empowerment
have been promulgated. Also, having almost 40% of our Cabinet Ministers  and
Deputy Ministers as  women,  has  forced  Government  departments  to  start
taking the needs of women into account. New  programmes  and  projects  have
been developed that focus specifically on women.

It is important  to  recognise  that  even  seemingly  unrelated  pieces  of
legislation, such as the Child Care Act, the  Social  Assistance  Bill,  the
Firearms Control Bill, the Domestic Violence and  Maintenance  Act,  amongst
other legislation, have a positive impact on  the  economic  empowerment  of
women. This is because such  pieces  of  legislation  offer  protection  and
support to women and gives them more confidence to enter the  workplace  and
find new opportunities - not to mention legislation such as  the  Employment
Equity Act and the Broad-Based  Black  Economic  Empowerment  Bill  that  we
discussed yesterday, which directly provides for  the  economic  empowerment
of women.

As a direct consequence of our democratic  approach  to  achieving  equality
between the sexes and the work that we, on our part,  the  political  party,
has done in Parliament, Government  and  the  private  sector,  there  is  a
substantially more favourable environment for women in our  country  and  in
our economy. From the data that we have available on  the  participation  of
women in the economy, we can see that women are  increasingly  entering  the
economy. They comprise approximately 42% of all businesses in South Africa.
I believe that this debate could not have come at a better  time.  Realising
that a lot of work has been done to support women in  business  yet  it  all
goes unreported,  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  brought  out  a
publication  in  honour  of  national  women's   month.   This   publication
highlights some  of  the  success  stories  of  ordinary  businesswomen  and
profiles over 30 successful women entrepreneurs who represent just a  sample
of the many women-owned businesses that have become successful in  the  past
nine years. Copies  of  this  publication  can  be  obtained  from  the  DTI
information centre on the 6th floor of 120 Plein Street. It is  called  Real
People because it tells you exactly what is happening out there.

I want to just read a little bit about a few of these women. With regard  to
Bulelwa Qupe from the Eastern Cape, the Nelson  Mandela  Metropole,  if  you
had told Bulelwa three years ago that she would own her  own  business,  she
would have laughed in your face - a fishing  business,  nogal!  Bulelwa  was
then a registered  nursing  administrator  and  a  community  health  nurse,
concerned with healing her fellow human beings. But now she  is  fighting  a
different struggle, that of economic liberation, not only for  herself,  but
for other women in the Eastern Cape. Listen to her own words:


  I approached the Eastern Cape  Development  Corporation  in  1997,  which
  offered a R50 000 loan, and luckily business went well and I paid it  off
  in two years. I used to have fish-supply problems and  when  I  heard  on
  radio that Government was offering fishing rights  to  women,  it  seemed
  like  a  God-sent  opportunity.  I  formed  a  co-operative  with   seven
  interested women and, as Ezabantu,  applied  and  eventually  obtained  a
  quota of 33 tons of fish, an equivalent of three boat trips per annum ...
  Each year our quota increased and we're now at 122 tons.

At  the  moment  Bulelwa  is  aready  exporting   her   fish   to   overseas
destinations. [Applause.]

Take Yolisa Kashe-Mzamo. She  is  one  of  King  William's  Town's  greatest
business success stories, unemployed only a few years ago, but  now  with  a
multimillion-rand contract under her belt. The accolades  are  just  pouring
in. In 1999  she  established  what  she  called  YKM  Productions  in  King
William's Town with a staff of 32, specialising  in  manufacturing  uniforms
for Daimler-Chrysler and corporate clothing. Various  well-known  shops  and
retail stores bought  her  products,  including  Game  Stores,  Pep  Stores,
Ackermans and Shoprite. What she says from her heart is:


  From winning Twib and associating with the DTI group I  have  changed  my
  mind-set and I am now more focused at lifting other women up  as  I  also
  grow economically. I've also expanded my business interests and gone into
  construction in a big way. I've learnt that when opportunity  arises  one
  has to grab it.

Going on, talking about real  people,  ordinary  women  doing  extraordinary
things, the next story to tell is that  of  Maud  Dikgetsi.  Relocated  from
Pretoria to Kimberley, Maud Dikgetsi refused to  be  deterred  by  different
circumstances.  She  was  a  Telkom  community  relations  national   senior
manager, based at the head office in Pretoria. Arriving  in  Kimberley,  she
was faced  with  gross  inequalities,  poverty  and  underdevelopment.  Most
important was the information drought affecting women  in  business  in  the
province.

Unlike others, Maud  refused  to  sit  back  and  do  nothing.  This  highly
motivated woman bade  goodbye  to  a  lucrative  and  comfortable  job  with
comparable options in Kimberley, but, besides the fact that she  today  runs
a flourishing florist's business, Maud established Moribo  Public  Relations
and Communications in the year 2000. The company specialises in  all  public
relations and events management.

That is the last one that I think I want to talk about. If  you  go  through
this book, you will read  about  women  who  have  gone  into  construction,
tourism and everything else, and what runs  through  their  stories  is  the
fact that each and every one of them has been assisted  by  this  Government
either to start or to grow their businesses or  to  expand  and  to  export.
[Applause.]
The support available to businesswomen such  as  these  includes  programmes
supported by the Department of Trade and Industry. I won't talk  much  about
Twib - a lot of us know what Twib is,  Technology  for  Women  in  Business,
which is aimed at encouraging women to access and use  technology.  Policies
have been introduced by the  National  Treasury  such  as  the  preferential
procurement policy,  which  gives  women-owned  businesses  preference  when
tendering  for  Government  contracts   and   contracts   from   state-owned
enterprises. We have joint DTI and  private-sector  intiatives  like  Sawen,
the  SA  Women  Entrepreneurs'  Network,  which  is  a  network   of   women
entrepreneurs that, amongst other things,  acts  as  their  advocacy,  their
eyes, their ears and their mouth.

There are programmes run by the Department of Agriculture that assist  women
small-scale  farmers  with  access  to   finance,   assist   them   to   run
agroprocessing industries, assist them with access  to  markets  and  assist
them to start nurseries and other small-scale farming  projects.  Programmes
run by the Department of Minerals and Energy promote and encourage women  to
start businesses in the energy sector. The Mining Charter sets a  target  of
10% of ownership of all mines and oil to be in the  hands  of  women  within
five years. There are also projects that facilitate the entry of women  into
the jewellery industry so that they are able to add value  to  the  minerals
that South Africa mines.

There are other initiatives from the private sector and NGOs  which  provide
substantial support to women in businesses. Amongst these I  can  count  the
Businesswomen's Association, the SA Women in Mining Association, or  Sawima,
SA Women in Oil and Gas, SA Women in Fishing, SA Women in  Construction,  or
Sawic, the  ISU  Women's  Initiative  and  Network  and  the  African  Women
Chartered Accountants' Association.

But I would be  the  first  one  to  acknowledge  that,  despite  all  these
successes, we still face many challenges in the  way  in  which  support  is
accessed. The support is there, but to get it to the women who need it is  a
major challenge.

So  we  need,  as  policy-makers  and  elected  representatives,  to  remain
vigilant in ensuring that the environment for women  in  business  continues
to remain favourable and that any new  legislation  that  we  pass  here  is
gender-sensitive and empowering to  women.  Secondly,  we  need  information
about our support structures and programmes to be given  to  women  so  that
they are aware of how  they  can  be  assisted.  Thirdly,  our  departments,
Government agencies and the private sectors must be pushed to find new  ways
to promote and support women enterprises. Fourthly, we need to  ensure  that
women move up the value chain; currently the majority  of  them  occupy  the
lower echelons in business.

To conclude, it is  clear  that  a  lot  has  been  done  to  support  women
enterprises in South Africa and that we have made substantial  progress.  It
is also clear that, through our support mechanisms,  we  are  just  touching
the surface of the possible impact that we can make in improving  the  lives
of women across our country, and that over the next 10 years much more  work
needs to  be  done  so  that  women  no  longer  comprise  the  majority  of
businesses  in  the  micro  and  survivalist  sectors,  but  actually  start
becoming medium-sized and also becoming industrialists in their  own  right.
Malibongwe! [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 18:52.
