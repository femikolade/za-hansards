                  CANCELLATION OF PROTEAS' TOUR TO PAKISTAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr D H M GIBSON: Speaker, I hereby move without notice:


  That the House -

Agreed to.

Agreed to (Democratic Alliance and Inkatha Freedom Party dissenting).

          APPOINTMENT OF DR TSHABALALA-MSIMANG AS ACTING PRESIDENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Nkk M N OLIPHANT  (ANC):  Sekela  Somlomo,  labo  abangezwani  nokukhushulwa
kwesithunzi nempilo  yabantu  besifazane  badumele  ngenkathi  uNgqongqoshe,
uDkt Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, efungiswa ukuba nguMongameli  wezwe  obambile
kulo Msombuluko esisuka kuwo.

Izitha  zenqubekela   phambili   ziyakhohlwa   umsebenzi   omuhle   owenziwe
nguHulumeni ka-ANC ekwenzeni  ngcono  impilo  yabantu  bakithi.  Ziyakhohlwa
yiqhaza elibalulekile elibanjwe  nguNgqonqgoshe  wezeMpilo  kulo  mkhankaso.
Zishiswa   ubandlululo   nokubukela   phansi   abantu   besifazane.   Izitha
zenqubekela phambili zishaya sengathi zilwa noNgqongqoshe  kanti  zilwa  ne-
ANC nemigomo yayo ethi  abantu  besifazane  mababekwe  ngokushesha  ezingeni
elihambisana nemiyalelo yokuhlonishwa kwamalungelo esintu.

Siyabonga kuNgqongqoshe uTshabalala-Msimang ukuthi uzibambe kahle  izintambo
zombuso ngenkathi uMongameli nePhini lakhe bengekho. Lokhu kuyinselelo  kubo
bonke abesimame ukuba bazi ukuthi akukho mqansa abangewukhwele.  Ngiyabonga.
[Ihlombe.] (Translation of isiZulu speech follows.)

[Mrs M N  OLIPHANT:  Deputy  Speaker,  those  who  are  opposed  to  women's
empowerment were unhappy  when  Minister  Dr  Manto  Tshabalala-Msimang  was
sworn in as the Acting President of the Republic of South Africa.

The enemies of  progress  tend  to  forget  about  the  good  work  the  ANC
Government has done to improve the lives of  our  people.  They  forget  the
important role played by the Minister of Health in this campaign.  They  are
full of the apartheid spirit and they look down on  women.  The  enemies  of
progress pretend to criticise the Minister but in fact they are  criticising
the ANC's policy, which says that women should be put at a level that is  in
line with the rules respecting human rights.

Thank you, Minister Tshabalala-Msimang for performing the duties  of  acting
President so well while the President and his deputy  were  away.  It  is  a
challenge to all women to know that there is no challenge that  they  cannot
face successfully. Thank you. [Applause.]

                          BY-ELECTION IN MALMESBURY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr  F  J  VAN  DEVENTER  (DA):  Agb  Adjunkspeaker,  die  uitslag  van  die
tussenverkiesing wat op 17 September 2003  in  Malmesbury  plaasgevind  het,
bevestig tendense in ander tussenverkiesings in  die  Wes-Kaap,  byvoorbeeld
Swellendam, Stellenbosch en in Grassy Park,  naamlik  dat  die  DA  goed  op
koers is om die ANC-nuwe NP-koalisie uit die kussings te lig  in  die  2004-
verkiesing in die Wes-Kaap. In Malmesbury het die DA 59,1%,  die  ANC  27,5%
en die Nuwe NP 13,3% van die stemme getrek. In die verkiesing van  1999  het
die Nuwe NP in dieselfde gebied 50,29%, die ANC 37,27% en die  ou  DP  4,03%
van die stemme getrek. In 2000 was die DA  se  stemme  in  dieselfde  gebied
55,9%, wat beteken dat daar 'n groei van 4% in die  laaste  tussenverkiesing
was.

Dit is duidelik dat die kiesers van alle gemeenskappe in  die  Wes-Kaap  die
Nuwe NP reeds afgeskryf het as 'n nuttelose en onbeholpe party in die  stryd
vir die behoud van 'n veelpartydemokrasie, wie se invloed  nie  vele  groter
is as dié van die MF nie. Die Nuwe NP het niks minder SA 'n vennoot van  die
ANC geword om mag te  sentraliseer,  om  sinvolle  opposisie  te  negeer  en
demokratiese beginsels en vryheid te verkwansel in 'n poging om  te  oorleef
nie. Die kiesers verdien beter. Die kiesers verdien 'n  DA-regering  in  die
Wes-Kaap. [Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr F J VAN DEVENTER (DA): Hon  Deputy  Speaker,  the  results  of  the  by-
election which took place on 17 September 2003 in Malmesbury, affirm  trends
in  other  by-elections  in  the  Western  Cape,  for  example   Swellendam,
Stellenbosch and Grassy Park, namely that the DA  is  well  on  its  way  to
ousting the ANC-New NP coalition in the 2004 elections in the Western  Cape.
In Malmesbury, the DA polled 59,1% of the votes, the ANC 27,5% and  the  New
NP 13,3%. In the 1999 election, in  the  same  region,  the  New  NP  polled
50,29% of the votes, the ANC 37,27% and the former DP 4,03%.  In  2000,  the
DA polled 55,9% in the same region,  which means that there was a growth  of
4% since the previous by-election.

It is clear that the voters from all communities in the  Western  Cape  have
already written off the New NP as a useless and inept party in the  struggle
for the preservation of a multiparty democracy, whose influence is not  much
greater than that of the MF. The New NP has become a  mere  partner  of  the
ANC to centralise power, to disregard meaningful opposition  and  to  barter
away democratic principles and freedom in  order  to  survive.   The  voters
deserve better.  The voters deserve a DA government  in  the  Western  Cape.
[Applause.]]

                   SHOCKING KIDNAPPING OF 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

                            (Member's Statement)

Nksz  M  XULU  (IFP):  Kwenzeke  isigameko  esishaqisayo   lapho   owesilisa
oneminyaka engamashumi  amathathu  ethumba  ingane  yentombazane  eneminyaka
eyishumi nane ekhaya layo eMpumalanga Koloni, wayiletha  lapha  eKapa  ukuze
ayenze inkosikazi yakhe. Le ngane ebifunda ibanga lesithupha, iye  yavalelwa
emkhukhwini walo mlisa yase inukubezwa ngokocansi izikhathi eziningana.

Okubi  kakhulu  ukuthi  le  ngane  ayigcinanga  nje  ngokuhlukunyezwa  kodwa
ilahlekelwe nayithuba lokuqhubeka nezifundo  zayo,  njengoba  kade  ivalelwe
emkhukhwini walo mlisa. Ingane eneminyaka  eyishumi  nane  isuke  isaqhubeka
nokukhula   emzimbeni   ngisho   nasengqondweni.   Ngale   kwalokho,   isuke
isenamathuba  amahle  kanye  namaphupho  amaningi  okusuke  kufanele  iwenze
empilweni.  Ngeshwa,  le  ngane  seyephucwe  zonke  lezi  zinto  yilo  mlisa
onomhobholo nenkohlakalo obone le ngane  njengento  angayisebenzisa  ukufeza
izinjongo zakhe zokonakala.

Le ngane beyisabhekene nomsebenzi  owodwa  nje  wokufunda  kunokuba  yenziwe
izinto  zabantu  abadala;  singasayiphathi   eyokuba   yenziwe   inkosikazi,
okungumsebenzi nakho ngokwakho owehlula abantu  abadala  ukuthi  unganikezwa
ingane eneminyaka eyishumi nane.

Sibonga, nokho, bonke abenze ukuthi lo mlisa ogange  kangaka  akwazi  ukuthi
aboshwe ukuze nabasazokwenza, bazi ukuthi uma  wenza  into  enjena  ubhekana
nani. Siyabonga. (Translation of isiZulu member's statement follows.)

[Miss M XULU (IFP): A shocking incident took place when a  30-year  old  man
kidnapped a 14-year old girl from her home in the Eastern Cape  and  brought
her to Cape Town so as to make her his wife. This child was doing  Grade  6.
She was locked in this man's shack  and  sexually  abused  on  a  number  of
occasions.

What is even worse is that not only was this child abused but she also  lost
an opportunity to continue with her studies,  as  she  was  locked  in  this
man's  shack.  A  14-year-old  child  is  still  developing  physically  and
mentally. She still has good opportunities and many dreams,  which  she  has
yet to fulfil in her life. Unfortunately, this child has  been  deprived  of
all these things by this greedy and corrupt man who saw  this  child  as  an
object to fulfil his evil purposes.

This child was still faced with the duty of studying rather than being  made
to do adult activities, not to mention becoming a wife - a  duty  that  even
adults cannot handle, and yet it is given to a 14-year-old child.

We are thankful, though, to those who made it possible for this very  wicked
man to be apprehended, so that even those who  are  thinking  of  doing  the
same thing will know what will happen to them. We thank you.

Mr C H F GREYLING: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order:  There  is  no
interpreting service.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Could we have interpreting please? The staff  will  look
into that.

                              ARREST OF VIARSA

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms  G  L  MAHLANGU-NKABINDE  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  the  ANC   wishes   to
congratulate those South Africans who were involved in  the  arrest  of  the
vessel, Viarsa. South Africa has  been  in  the  forefront  of  pushing  for
greater  international  controls  over  Patagonian   toothfish   and   other
endangered fish species, and illegal fishing practices.

South Africa is, therefore, particularly pleased to have been able  to  come
to the assistance of Australia in this dramatic 21-day  hot  pursuit  across
the Southern Ocean. This is the  second  time  that  South  Africa  has  co-
operated with  Australia  in  this  manner.  Two  years  ago,  South  Africa
assisted Australia in the arrest of the South Tommy  for  illegally  fishing
Patagonian toothfish which led to her arrest and conviction.

South  Africa  is  committed  to  such  co-operation  because  not  only  is
Patagonian toothfish highly endangered and  requires  protection,  but  also
because it is an extremely  valuable  fish  which  is  found  in  our  seas,
notably around Marion Island and Prince Edward Island.  Beyond  this,  South
Africa recognises its international obligation in terms  of  the  high  seas
and protecting Patagonian toothfish. These obligations  arise  in  terms  of
the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living  Resources  of
which South Africa is a member.

We salute the ANC for the notable stability and  normality  in  the  fishing
industry. I thank you. [Applause.]

       APPEAL FOR INTERVENTION BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH IN MPUMALANGA

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R T RHODA (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker,  the  time  has  come  for  the
national Minister of  Health  to  intervene  in  the  health  department  of
Mpumalanga. This department has been wracked by controversy  over  the  past
years which has, in turn, hampered service delivery.  The  New  NP  welcomes
the removal of the previous MEC for health after the  premier  had  admitted
that the department of health was in serious disarray and  that  there  were
cases of gross mismanagement and neglect in the department.

However, only three weeks  after  the  appointment  of  the  new  MEC,  Busi
Coleman,   there   are,   once   again,   allegations   of   nepotism    and
maladministration. The New NP is worried that these allegations  will,  once
again, shift the focus from service delivery to the people of Mpumalanga  to
internal political disputes. The only solution for this is for the  national
Minister of Health to intervene because the  people  of  Mpumalanga  deserve
better service delivery. I thank you.

                         RELEASE OF CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L M GREEN (ACDP): Deputy Speaker, the most important  function  of  civil
government is to protect law-abiding citizens and to bring  to  justice  all
those who break the law.

The release of the latest crime statistics to the  media  today,  under  the
lock-up situation, is  unacceptable  to  the  ACDP.  We  understand  if  the
Minister of Finance needs a lock-up session with the  finance  committee  in
order to release details of the Budget before he  addresses  this  House  on
the same day. But, we fail to  understand  why  crime  statistics  are  made
available to the press before they are made available  to  members  of  this
House. The Safety and Security committee has an oversight  role  and  should
be the first to be informed of the latest crime statistics.

The mentioning today, by the Minister, that  crime  is  stabilising  is  not
encouraging to the ACDP. Government  must  set  clear  achievable  goals  to
eliminate crime and not to stabilise it. Much  more  funding  must  be  made
available to fight crime. I thank you.

                          CONVICTION OF TWO RAPISTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms M R MORUTOA (ANC): Deputy Speaker, last week two men who  were  convicted
of serial rape charges in the Delmas circuit court were  sentenced  to  long
jail terms. Jan Moraring and  Johannes  Twala  received  254  and  146  year
sentences respectively. The ANC welcomes  these  long  sentences  that  were
meted out to these rapists. It is of critical importance  that  our  justice
system sends out a clear message that there  is  no  place  for  abusers  of
women and children in our society.
We also commend the SA Police Service for their sterling  work  in  bringing
such culprits to book. Incidents of this nature, though, point to a  greater
social problem. They are a manifestation of a sickness that  still  afflicts
our society. Partly,  they  emphasise  the  need  to  accelerate  our  moral
regeneration effort and, on a broader level, the need to  work  unreservedly
for the creation of a normal society that is  free  from  sexism,  prejudice
and inhumanity, and the need to accelerate social, political,  economic  and
cultural transformation. I thank you. [Applause.]

                            FF WINS TWO ELECTIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr P W A MULDER (FF): During the past  week,  the  FF  participated  in  two
important elections. In both of these elections the FF  won.  The  FF  would
like to thank the voters for their support and their confidence in the FF.

Last week, the  FF  defeated  both  the  DA  and  the  ANC  in  the  student
representative council election at the University of Pretoria.  It  is  most
significant  that  the  New  NP  had  chosen  not  to  participate  in  this
particular election. The SRC election is driven on a party political  basis.
Both Mr Lekota and Mr Leon visited 30 campuses as  part  of  their  parties'
campaigns. The results indicate to what extent  the  youth  and  leaders  of
tomorrow prefer and support the FF as a political party.

Last Wednesday, the FF, also,  against  the  expectations  of  many,  won  a
municipal by-election in ward 23 in Bloemfontein - one of the  strongest  DA
wards in Bloemfontein. In  the  by-election,  the  FF  polled  1  231  votes
against the 1 206 of the DA. In the previous election,  which  was  held  in
2000, the DA managed to obtain 86% of the votes in ward 23. This  time,  the
DA only received 37% of the votes. The New NP received 552 -  which  is  17%
of the votes, and the ACDP received 264. A high  voting  percentage  of  41%
was registered.

The results of both these elections indicate a significant shift  by  voters
to the FF, and  that  has  definite  implications  for  the  realignment  of
political parties regarding the general election of next year.

Die Vryheidsfront wil alle kiesers daar buite  wat  op  hierdie  wyse  hulle
vertroue in die  Vryheidsfront  gestel  het,  bedank  vir  hul  steun.  Baie
dankie. [The Freedom Front wants to thank  all  voters  out  ther,  who  put
their trust in the Freedom Front in this manner, for  their  support.  Thank
you very much.]

                      CLOSURE OF NEWSPAPER IN ZIMBABWE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms T E MILLIN (IAM): Madam Deputy Speaker, weekend headlines and  editorials
proclaimed, yet again, one of the most disturbing events of the  past  week,
namely,  the  illegal  and  unconstitutional  shutting  down  of  the   last
remaining independent newspaper in Zimbabwe. The Sunday  Times  headline  of
21 September states unequivocally what we all know, namely, quiet  diplomacy
is a national disgrace. [Interjections.]

The  Sunday  Tribune  of  the  same  date  refers  to   President   Mugabe's
mollycoddling ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order!

Ms T E MILLEN: Madam Deputy Speaker,  it  refers  to  the  mollycoddling  of
Mugabe as doing serious damage to South  Africa's  international  reputation
under the glaring headline ``Pampering Mugabe shames us.''  Mugabe's  latest
flouting of any so-called attempts at quiet  diplomacy  have  been  brazenly
disregarded through the dishonouring of a high court ruling last week  which
ordered the Zimbabwean government to return  all  confiscated  property  and
allow the Daily News to resume publication.

We have waited in vain to  hear  our  President  or  at  least  a  spokesman
unequivocally condemn these  actions  against  press  freedom.  Instead,  Mr
Khumalo berates Australian Prime Minister John Howard's megaphone  diplomacy
after Howard rightly stated that Mugabe had no place at the  troika  meeting
in Nigeria.

A former farmer from Zimbabwe came up  to  me  at  Cape  Town  International
Airport this morning and told me that  his  farm  was  stolen  from  him  by
force.  He  lost  everything  but  he  has  been  welcomed  by  the  Zambian
government to start farming there. His heartfelt plea  to  me  was:  Please,
ask your President to do something to prevent the  utter  mayhem  and  havoc
that Mugabe has and still is wreaking  in  Zimbabwe  and  on  its  citizens.
Thank you. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

                            COUP IN GUINEA BISSAU

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D J SITHOLE (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, on Sunday,  14  September  2003,
the military in Guinea Bissau took over the government of that country in  a
coup d'état. The ANC condemns this military takeover. We urge  the  military
leaders of Guinea Bissau to urgently hand over power to  civilian  rule.  We
believe that the only acceptable way to effect a  change  of  government  is
through a democratic process.

Governments on the continent should exercise their  powers  within  the  new
broad vision of good governance, democracy and respect for human  rights  to
avoid any further military interventions. It is in the best interest of  all
the people of Guinea Bissau that stability be restored so that they can,  as
a matter of  urgency,  begin  to  focus  on  issues  of  reconstruction  and
economic development through the African Union. I thank you. [Applause.]

                         RELEASE OF CRIME STATISTICS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D H M GIBSON (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, the hon Minister for Safety  and
Security owes Parliament and the portfolio committee an apology.

In a laughably pretentious action, the media were admitted  into  a  lock-up
so that they could receive privileged access to the crime statistics.  Those
statistics are 18 months old - a lot of them - and the  newest  are  already
six months out of  date.  A  Budget  lock-up  by  the  Minister  of  Finance
includes parliamentarians and is justified because pre-knowledge  of  Budget
proposals could benefit some, but a lock-up is ridiculous when  it  releases
old and outdated statistics. And,  in  any  event,  they  have  been  leaked
selectively by the Minister for months, and many, such as  Business  Against
Crime, get these figures weekly.

The crime trend shows that some crimes have stabilised or  slowed  somewhat,
but the arrest and conviction rates are lagging badly. The  only  lock-up  I
am interested in is the lock-up of criminals.  Whatever  the  crime  trends,
the one thing needing attention is the arrest, conviction and punishment  of
the guilty. The criminals and the public need to know that  crime  does  not
pay. This is certainly not the case at present. [Applause.]

                      CONTROVERSIAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr U ROOPNARAIN (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, a decision  by  the  department
of agriculture and environmental  affairs  in  KwaZulu-Natal  to  approve  a
controversial upmarket housing development on the fringe of a  rare  coastal
forest has drawn fierce opposition from conservation  groups  and  eThekwini
Municipality.

The housing complex is  on  the  border  of  the  Hawaan  Forest  Estate  in
Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal. This forest boasts 140  species  of  trees  and  is
home  to  animals  such  as  the  bushbuck.  The  main  opposition  to   the
development centres  on  its  proximity  to  the  forest  and  the  adjacent
grassland that has been earmarked for the site.

We hope that the environmental impact assessment  was  thoroughly  conducted
and that all relevant procedures were adhered to. A situation  cannot  arise
where development is put before  environment.  The  environment  has  to  be
preserved so that future generations can also appreciate it. This should  be
the only footprint that we leave behind. Thank you.

                 ALEXANDRA TOWNSHIP BOY DEMANDS TO BE TAUGHT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr O BAPELA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, last Monday an eight-year old  boy,
Bheki Mbatha, from Alexandra Township near Johannesburg, walked barefoot  to
school for the first time in his life,  entered  a  Grade  1  classroom  and
demanded to be taught.

In just over a week the boy has become a model pupil and spends hours  after
school doing homework. His school, Lekhata Primary School, has provided  him
with a uniform and shoes. The story of  this  child  serves  to  remind  all
South Africans about the sad conditions  under  which  some  of  our  people
continue to live. This reality appeals to our spiritual,  mental,  emotional
and physical beings to reject the continued  presence  of  such  situations.
Such reality denies us the claim of being human. This is the reason for  the
continuation of the struggle for national liberation and social justice.

It is this reality that creates shock in us when some in this  House  oppose
progressive social transformation in favour of animalism, racism and  greed.
This reality is the reason we commit ourself to fighting side by side  until
the right to learn and human dignity, that is the  eradication  of  poverty,
are a living reality for all in our country. We thank you. [Applause.]

                 REVISED ALLOCATION OF LINE FISHING PERMITS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr C B HERANDIEN (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Adjunkspeaker, die Nuwe NP  wil  die
Minister van Omgewingsake en  Toerisme  bedank  vir  sy  optrede  nadat  ons
probleme in die toekenning van lynvispermitte onder sy aandag  gebring  het.
Tydens besoeke aan Overstrand het inwoners hulle teleurstelling  uitgespreek
oor die wyse waarop lynvispermitte toegeken  is.  Na  bewering  is  permitte
toegeken aan plesierbooteienaars terwyl beroepsvissermanne se bote  aan  wal
lê. Die gevolg  is  dat  bestaansvissers  in  hierdie  gebiede  in  uiterste
armoede gedompel is.

Nadat  die  situasie  onder  die  aandag  van  die  Nuwe  NP-leier,  premier
Marthinus van Schalkwyk, gekom het, het hy onmiddellik die Minister  genader
en kon hy reeds by die Wes-Kaapse imbizo op 26  Julie  2003  aan  mense  die
versekering gee dat  die  saak  op  die  hoogste  vlak  aandag  geniet.  Die
uiteinde hiervan was dat die Minister onderneem het om  self  die  mense  se
app-èlsake aan te hoor.  Daarná  het  hy  aan  nog  54  vissersbote  en  341
bemanningslede permitte toegeken.

Ten slotte wil die Nuwe NP die Minister bedank vir die  onderneming  wat  hy
gegee het om treknetvispermitte voor die einde van die jaar  te  finaliseer.
Anders as die DA, wat net publisiteitshonger  is,  streef  die  Nuwe  NP  na
gelykberegtiging. [Tussenwerpsels.] Hierdie saak kan  net  opgelos  word  as
almal saamwerk en daar nie verwyte oor en weer geslinger word nie.

Die Nuwe NP glo, deur mense die geleentheid te bied om self vis te  vang  en
sodoende kos op hulle tafel te kry, dat dit sal verseker dat hulle elke  dag
iets het om te eet, in plaas daarvan om hulle met elke tussenverkiesing  met
kospakkies te verwar.  Ek  dank  u.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
member’s statement follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN (New NP): Madam Deputy Speaker, the New NP wants to  thank
the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism for  the  action  he  took
after we had  brought  problems  associated  with  the  allocation  of  line
fishing permits to his attention.  During  visits  to  Overstrand  residents
expressed their disappointment at the manner in which line  fishing  permits
had been allocated. Permits were allegedly awarded to pleasure  boat  owners
while career  fishermen  cannot  put  to  sea.  In  consequence  subsistence
fishermen in these areas have been plunged into extreme poverty.

After the situation was brought to the  attention  of  the  New  NP  leader,
Premier Marthinus van Schalkwyk, he immediately approached the Minister  and
at the Western Cape imbizo on 26 July 2003  he  was  already  able  to  give
people the assurances  that  the  matter  was  receiving  attention  at  the
highest level. The outcome was that the Minister  undertook  to  hear  these
peoples cases on appeal personally. Afterwards  he  awarded  permits  to  an
additional 54 fishing boats and 341 crew members.

In conclusion, the New NP wishes to thank the Minister for  the  undertaking
he gave to finalise the drag-net fishing  permits  before  the  end  of  the
year. Unlike the DA, who only hunger for publicity, the New NP  strives  for
equal treatment. [Interjections.] This matter can only be  resolved  if  all
the parties involved work together and do not blame each other.

The New NP believes that by affording people the opportunity to catch  their
own fish and in this way feed themselves, this will ensure  that  they  have
something to eat every day, instead of  confusing  them  with  food  parcels
before every by-election. I thank you. [Applause.]]

                     ELECTIONS AT UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Deputy Speaker, there were two issues  that
arose. One was raised by the hon Bapela and the other one by hon Mulder.  So
there are two distinct ones.

In relation to hon Mulder's intervention, may I say we are all  very  amused
by claims - on either side of the house - of  a  freak  result  here  and  a
freak result there. I think we enjoy this in  Parliament  -  knocking  spots
off each other. Sometimes it is foolish to do that.

At the University of Pretoria the elections were  run  on  a  racist  basis.
[Interjections.] All the parties who participated opposed  the  elections  -
the DP, the ANC.  One  newspaper,  a  tabloid,  published,  to  its  eternal
credit, all the posters, hon  Mulder,  and  if  they  were  not  racist  and
chauvinist I do not know what they were. I have written  officially  to  the
Vice Chancellor of  the  University  to  ask:  "How  do  you  soothe  this?"
[Interjections.] No, no, no.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! What is it, hon Mulder?

Dr C P MULDER: Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: Is it in order  for  the
hon Minister to mislead the House?

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: No, no, no. Please, that  is  a  debating  point,
sit down! [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order!  No,  hon  member,  you  can't  accuse  the  hon
Minister of misleading the House. Please proceed, hon Minister.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Sit down; that is a  debating  point!  Sit  down!
Look at the photographs; they are quite clearly chauvinist photographs.  And
there have been interviews with young black and coloured students  who  said
they didn't feel comfortable at the University of Pretoria anymore. This  is
the second time this has happened  and  the  university  has  abdicated  its
responsibility of creating conditions  in  which  all  students  would  feel
comfortable.

I don't know how far you or your party were involved,  hon  Mr  Mulder,  but
the fact is, if I were  you  I  would  repudiate  the  results  rather  than
extolling them in this House as  prime  examples  of  the  victory  of  your
party. [Applause.] You should be ashamed! You should be ashamed of  claiming
victory there, because you are playing with  fire!  That  is  what  you  are
playing with and we are too long in the tooth  now  to  play  with  fire  in
South Africa by using racism.

                 ALEXANDRA TOWNSHIP BOY DEMANDS TO BE TAUGHT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: The second statement, not entirely  unrelated  to
the previous one, was raised by the hon Bapela, because the story  of  Bheki
Mbatha is the triumph of public education. We now have 10 years'  compulsory
education from next year. We are carrying out our promise, but  the  problem
is how do you enforce compulsory education? For middle-class parents you  do
not have to enforce it, because there is an established culture and all  the
means necessary to bring up the children.

However, when you come to a young boy living with his  mother  in  a  little
room without windows, how do you enforce it? By prosecuting the  mother?  By
putting her in jail, which is what the Schools Act says we  should  normally
be doing? Or by providing home education  which  is  what  many  people  are
doing, but you don't register? And that is why this young  boy  going  there
is a second party. He is asserting his right to education. He  is  asserting
this extraordinary resilience and courage that our people have,  faced  with
a kind of adversity none of us  in  this  Parliament  and  this  House  ever
faces, and neither does any of us have in our background the  same  kind  of
disturbance and alienation.

So, we can say, therefore, that congratulations go  to  this  young  person.
The congratulations also go to the  triumph  of  the  collective  spirit  by
means of which neighbours, school and newspaper readers have  come  together
and said they would help this boy, who obviously has enormous  strength  and
intelligence. What we are doing here by  raising  this  matter  is  in  fact
living up to the principles of the preamble to our Constitution.

Let's draw on the capacity of all our people. It is the first  time  in  our
history that we are doing  so  and  we  must  celebrate  Bheki  Mbatha,  his
mother, Lekhata Primary School and  those  who  have  shown  that  wonderful
tradition of solidarity against individual  greed  and  malice  -  the  real
solidarity in which, in fact,  all  our  people  can  now  find  spirit  and
strength in a better life for all our people. [Applause.]

                              ARREST OF VIARSA

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  I
want to respond to the hon Mahlangu and also to the statement  made  by  the
hon Herandien.

I want to express gratitude on behalf of the women and men who  participated
in the daring expedition to arrest the Viarsa, which was  a  ship  flying  a
flag of convenience that had  poached  Patagonian  toothfish  in  Australian
waters and which was then pursued by an  Australian  patrol  boat,  but  the
Viarsa was able, so to say, to outrun the Australian patrol boat.  It  ended
up in the southern seas close to Antarctica and Cape Town. When I say  close
to Cape Town I mean about a five days' boat ride from Cape Town.

The Australian patrol boat, firstly, was  not  ice  reinforced.  So  it  was
unable to break ice and therefore there was a fear that as the sea began  to
freeze up it  would  not  be  able  to  pursue  the  Viarsa.  Secondly,  the
Australian patrol boat began to run out of fuel,  and  in  the  end  it  did
indeed run out of fuel. So what would have happened is that the  Australians
would have needed to be saved. And, thirdly, the Australian patrol boat  did
not have the requisite capacity, as far as the  inspectorate  is  concerned,
to physically execute an arrest.

Therefore the role that the SA Agulhas played is one  which  should  not  be
underestimated. It went out in pursuit of the Viarsa. It was able to  refuel
the Australian patrol boat. The Australians unfortunately were not  prepared
for this sort of situation so they were not armed. The armed  South  African
officials were then able to board the Viarsa in order to arrest the  skipper
and to ensure that all of them were then brought  to  Cape  Town,  in  fact,
just outside our territorial waters, to effect it.

So this was a major drama on the high seas and I think it  was  a  wonderful
example of co-operation between South Africa and Australia. In recent  years
we have also co-operated with France and the United States, and I  think  we
are beginning to reach a point where we can make the  southern  oceans  safe
from pirates who fly flags of convenience. So thank you very much for  that.
I think that the people involved in this will appreciate that  comment  very
much.

                  REVISED ALLOCATION OF LINEFISHING PERMITS

                            (Member's Statement)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Also  then  on  another
fishing-related matter, I think the hon Herandien has quite rightly  pointed
out the degree of confusion that members of the DA have been causing in  the
fishing industry. [Interjections.]

I can tell you that - I am not referring to anybody in  particular  so  they
don't need to get excited - what some enterprising members  of  the  DA  had
decided to do was to assist persons to apply for fishing rights  and  by  so
doing they prejudiced quite a significant  number  of  persons  by  doing  a
number of things wrong; either by filling in the  application  forms  in  an
incorrect  manner  or  incompletely,  or,  because  of  the   administrative
bungling in the DA offices, by failing to submit the  applications  in  good
time. [Interjections.]

So you should know that there were some very poor people and very  deserving
cases that would not have been prejudiced,  had  they  not  been  misled  by
members of the DA. And I would really want  to  request  the  DA,  like  all
other parties do in this House, to keep their nose out of things which  they
do not  understand  and  which  they  are  unable  to  administer  as  such.
[Interjections.]

There is no record of the DA being able to administer anything  complicated.
This is  beyond  you.  It  is  too  complicated.  Leave  it  to  Government.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

           NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: PROTECTED AREAS BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Madam Deputy Speaker,  as
members of the House would know, just last week, we ended the ten-day  World
Parks Congress which was held in Durban. This congress  was  attended  by  3
000 delegates from all  around  the  world  and  was  the  most  significant
international gathering of  conservationists  to  be  held  in  at  least  a
decade.

This congress found that it has cause to celebrate  because  protected  area
coverage worldwide has trebled  in  the  past  20  years  and  has  provided
society with immeasurable benefits such as clean water, fish  stocks,  flood
protection and the reduction of poverty supporting sustainable  livelihoods.
Increasingly  protected  areas  are   providing   impetus   for   sustaining
international   friendship,   peace   and   security,   through   burgeoning
transfrontier conservation areas and initiatives across the world.

A central theme of  the  World  Parks  Congress  was  the  recognition  that
protected areas cannot be islands of conservation divorced from  the  social
and  economic  context  within  which  they  are  located.   They   generate
significant economic, environmental and social  benefits.  This  makes  them
powerful  contributors  to  poverty  reduction   and   to   the   millennium
development goals that have been adopted by  the  United  Nations,  and  the
objectives of the WSSD.

We are heralding a new era in which we seek synergies  between  conservation
and developmental agendas. It is an era in  which  protected  areas  play  a
vital role in the achieving of this  synergy  and  integration  and  provide
benefits  beyond  boundaries:  Beyond  the  immediate   boundaries,   beyond
boundaries of nation states and across societies, cultures and  generations.


The congress also  laid  the  foundation  for  this  new  paradigm.  It  has
reviewed and reinforced the  role  of  protected  areas  in  conserving  the
diversity of  plant  and  animal  species,  in  maintaining  ecosystems  and
preserving historical and cultural resources, in securing the beauty of  the
landscapes that have enriched human experience and in protecting  places  of
spiritual value.

The World Parks Congress clearly outlined a new and complementary role  that
protected areas play in reducing pervasive poverty and catalysing local  and
national economic and social development.

We in South Africa have gone a long way in conserving our own  biodiversity.
I can proudly say that we currently have 403 protected  areas  covering  6,6
million hectares; and this translates to  5,5%  of  South  Africa's  surface
area. We currently have 22 national parks covering 53%  of  the  total  area
under protection.

Since 1994 we have brought an additional 457  000  hectares  of  land  under
protection and I am grateful to  Parliament  for  making  this  possible  by
voting the necessary funds. There is still a lot of work to be  done  if  we
are to achieve the internationally set target of our land area by 2010.

It gives  me  great  pleasure  to  introduce  to  this  House  the  National
Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill. This Bill  aims  to  create,
across all three spheres of government, a single and  interconnected  system
of protected areas. It is premised on the fact  that  South  Africa  is  the
third most biodiverse country in the world. It recognises biodiversity as  a
national asset and encourages sustainable use and management of this  asset,
and  legislates  for  access   and   benefit   sharing   for   participating
communities.

Initially we intended to  include  the  National  Environmental  Management:
Protected Areas Bill in the National Environmental Management  Comprehensive
Biodiversity Bill in which protected areas would be one  chapter,  but,  for
practical reasons, these have now been separated. We also  had  to  separate
the Bill that  is  before  us  right  now,  because  the  parliamentary  law
advisors were of the view  that  the  Bill  contains  both  section  75  and
section 76 elements. It contains aspects that are purely  within  the  ambit
of the national Parliament and those that are shared  between  the  national
Parliament and the provincial legislatures. We have therefore  separated  it
and the second part of the Bill will then follow, so as not to put  a  mixed
Bill before Parliament. The integration will take place at a later stage.

The objective of this Bill is really to  provide  for  the  declaration  and
management of protected areas throughout the country. In line with the  rest
of the world we have been pioneering the concept of people and parks,  where
we see people as being central in the way we manage the  parks.  There  have
been  interesting  and  encouraging  efforts  by  the   various   management
authorities in attempting  to  involve  communities  in  the  management  of
protected areas and the entering into of agreements on sustainable  use  and
harvesting by communities in and around protected areas.

The  Bill  recognises  these  efforts  and  extends  this  concept  to   all
management  authorities  which  must  have,  in  their   management   plans,
provisions on how  they  are  going  to  encourage  community-based  natural
resource management. The Bill recognises the achievements made  with  regard
to land restitution claims in the  last  10  years,  where  successful  land
claim communities have agreed to make the land available for conservation.

I need to draw your attention to the successful contractual arrangements  we
have made, for example, with the Makuleke community, the  community  in  the
Richtersveld and the Mbyela communities. The communities have chosen not  to
resettle in the areas in the parks to which they are justly  entitled  under
the land reform process but rather to conserve these  areas,  while  at  the
same time  ensuring  sustainable  use  and  development  of  the  ecotourism
potential.

The Bill gives legal recognition to  these  new  approaches  and  encourages
other communities to make their  land  available  for  conservation  without
losing their ownership rights. It  encourages  the  concept  of  contractual
parks and seeks to allow for benefit and empowerment of community members.

As I have indicated earlier, this Bill strengthens  co-operative  governance
in the management and protection  of  protected  areas  and  in  creating  a
national system of protected areas.  It  allows  for  the  establishment  of
national norms and standards which will apply to all protected areas in  the
country. It further requires that management authorities be subjected  to  a
performance management system  with  clear  performance  indicators  set  to
their performance as well as periodic reporting on performance targets.

This Bill  also  provides  for  the  creation  of  what  is  called  special
protected areas or special nature reserves.  This  will  provide  for  areas
like, for example, the  Prince  Edward  Islands,  whose  ecosystems  are  so
fragile  that  we  cannot  really  allow  for  sustainable  use  of  natural
resources in such areas.

The Bill that is complementary to this would also allow for  the  manner  in
which national parks are created. But the interesting thing that we are  now
doing is that a nationally protected area could be managed by a  variety  of
agencies and this does not always have to be  the  SA  National  Parks.  For
example, we could well have an ecosystem  that  is  of  national  or  global
significance but may well be a provincial park at this  point  in  time.  It
will now be possible to place such areas under national  protection  without
taking away the right of the province to manage such an area.

In that sense it is very innovative indeed. It  also  gives  Parliament,  as
the only authority, the right to reverse a decision on a  special  protected
area or on a nationally declared protected area. Once  a  national  park  is
created, it will not be possible for Government to undeclare, so  to  speak,
such an area. That would have to be a decision of Parliament itself.

The enactment of this Bill  will  strengthen  our  resolve  to  ensure  that
protected areas are mainstreamed within the framework of  a  pro-people  and
pro-development  agenda  aimed  at  socioeconomic  development  and  poverty
eradication. [Applause.]

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The Durban Accord  from
the World Parks Congress describes protected areas as a gift. I quote:


  Protected areas are  the  wonderful  gift  we  pass  from  generation  to
  generation. On land and at sea they are crucial to the  survival  of  the
  millions of species forming an ecological web intricately linked to human
  survival, they are the genetic storehouses  containing  a  promise  of  a
  healthier future for the planet and its peoples.

The accord further states:


  They protect the quality of air, soil and water. They help  regulate  and
  buffer Earth's natural processes to balance our climate.  They  safeguard
  invaluable  parts  of  our  natural  and  cultural  heritage  and  embody
  spiritual, aesthetic and ethical values  for  many  societies.  Protected
  areas provide sustainable income opportunities to meet the needs of local
  people.

In the 21st century we are faced with the rapid disappearance of  much  that
is wild. Africa is the custodian of wild lands and  cultures,  but  our  own
human  deeds  are  now  destroying  much  of  it.  We  were  given  a  clean
environment, as  contained  in  section  24  of  our  Constitution,  by  our
forefathers. That is why this ANC-led Government is giving back  that  right
to ensure that we pass it from generation  to  generation  in  the  same  or
better condition. This Bill endeavours to restore pride and,  above  all,  a
sense of belonging to our people.

South Africa has the highest level of biological diversity  of  any  country
in the world. Estimates of the total number of species in this country  vary
from 250 000 to a million. This richness and diversity is  due  to  a  broad
range of climatic, geological, soil  and  landscape  forms  found  in  South
Africa. Some 18 000 vascular plant  species  occur  within  our  boundaries,
7,5% of the global total, of which 80% occur  nowhere  else  in  the  world.
This is more than twice the number of plants found in  the  USA,  a  country
that is over  five  times  the  size  of  South  Africa.  That  is  why  our
environment must be preserved for generations to come.  Very  few  countries
can boast about endemic plants. We must educate our people about their  rich
heritage for maximum protection.

South Africa has to render its wild lands sustainable at a social level,  as
well as an economic level. We believe that a true  experience  of  protected
areas is the impact of the wilderness on the  human  spirit.  Today,  nearly
ten years under the new  Government,  experiences  in  nature  reserves  are
beyond the economic reach of most South Africans. Recent surveys have  shown
that only 4% of all black people have experienced nature and game  reserves,
an experience  which  motivates  the  individual  to  the  higher  ideal  of
conservation. Ironically far more Western  tourists  have  been  stirred  by
these wilderness areas. As the need for conservation increases, so does  the
protection of such areas. As we succeeded just a few days ago, Minister,  to
make all South African MPs ambassadors of tourism, we  should  also  succeed
to make them protectors of the environment.

When addressing the World Parks Congress in  Durban,  President  Mbeki  said
``Benefits Beyond Boundaries'' will look at ways of alleviating  poverty  of
the communities in and around protected areas.  He  said  that  the  world's
natural resources and biodiversity are a priceless heritage, which hold  the
key to many challenges, from pharmaceutical properties to strengthening  the
gene base of South Africa's basic resources.

Also addressing the Parks Congress Kofi Annan, through Klaus Toepfer,  said:
"While the number of reported protected areas has multiplied  a  hundredfold
to more than 100 000 since 1962, essential  ecosystem  functions  are  being
undermined, perhaps  irretrievably,  as  forests  are  felled  and  wetlands
drained, and terrestrial and marine habitats degraded by pollution."

We did not attend the last World Parks Congress on protected areas,  because
we were still not part of the government, but we have achieved most  of  the
objectives set out in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1992.

Firstly, we have ratified the Kyoto  Protocol;  some  old  democracies  have
not.  Secondly,  we  are  signatories  of  the  Convention   on   Biological
Diversity.  Thirdly,  we  recognise  the  importance  of  local  people   as
stakeholders in protected areas. Finally, we are leading when  it  comes  to
transfrontier parks - such parks contribute to stability  and  peace  within
countries.

The targets set for the coming 10 years will easily  be  met  by  the  South
African Government, judging from the way we have performed  so  far.  It  is
not a coincidence  that  most  of  the  world's  important  conferences  are
brought to South Africa. It is because we continue to be a shining star.  We
are a good example while we remain mindful and  committed  to  dealing  with
the plight of humanity, poverty  and  hopelessness.  We  also  realise  that
there should be development for prosperity but not at  the  expense  of  the
environment. We will always be champions of sustainable development.

May I thank the Minister and the department, especially the Deputy Director-
General, Sis Pam Yako, for spending such a lot of time away from her  family
with members of the committee, and of course the members  of  the  portfolio
committee for again giving the country one of the best pieces  of  protected
areas legislation in the world. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr J W LE ROUX: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  I  think  Minister  Moosa  was  very
unfair in his severe criticism of the DA. I think  it  is  common  knowledge
that the DA plays a very positive role in conservation in South Africa.

I would like to place on record that I  have  an  interest  in  a  property-
owning company whose property will  in  all  likelihood  become  part  of  a
protected area, and that I declared my  interest  to  the  committee  during
discussions of the Bill.

Hierdie wet handel ooreenkomstig artikel 76 van die  Grondwet  en  weens  'n
beslissing van die Speaker ten opsigte van die  regsgeldigheid  van  hierdie
wet is daar klousules wat betref Nasionale Parke hierin uitgesluit.  Hierdie
klousules sal met 'n latere wysiging hanteer word.

Hierdie wet tesame met die wet op biodiversiteit, en  amendemente  op  ander
omgewingswette, plaas die Departement Omgewingsake en  Toerisme  nou  in  'n
gunstige posisie om bewaring en toerisme tot hul reg te laat  kom.  Die  wet
maak dit ook verpligtend dat 'n register van bewaringsgebiede gehou word  en
dat aan norms en standaarde deur bestuursowerhede voldoen moet word.

Hierdie wet sal dit moontlik en bekostigbaar maak om  die  landsoppervlakte,
wat deur een of ander bewaringsorganisasie bestuur  word,  in  vyf  jaar  te
verdubbel. Tans is die oppervlakte wat onder bewaringsbeheer is ongeveer  6%
van die landsoppervlakte, en hierdie wet sal dit moontlik maak  dat  hierdie
gebied  vergroot  tot  12%  wat  ons  dan  in   ooreenstemming   bring   met
wêreldstandaarde.

Die tweede groot voordeel van hierdie wet is dat grondeienaars en  plaaslike
gemeenskappe betrokke sal wees in bewaring. Dit is  net  eenvoudig  'n  feit
dat parke nie in isolasie suksesvol kan voortbestaan  nie.  Selfs  nie  eens
Nasionale  Parke  wat  besonder  goed  bestuur  word,  kon  die   druk   van
gemeenskappe rondom parke suksesvol hanteer nie.

Derdens sal die wet die beginsel van  deelnemende  regering  'n  werklikheid
maak. Die bedoeling  van  die  wet  is  om  gemeenskappe  wat  in  beskermde
omgewings woon ruim geleentheid te gee  om  betrokke  te  raak  en  volledig
ingelig te bly oor die bestuur van hierdie gebiede.

Die wet maak voorsiening vir die skep en bestuur  van  bewaringsgebiede  wat
onder andere die volgende insluit: spesiale natuurreservate  wat  verwys  na
die mees sensitiewe  gebiede,  soos  byvoorbeeld  eilande  en  gebiede  waar
navorsing gedoen word; natuurreservate  wat  in  die  ou  terme  Provinsiale
Parke was,  wat  dien  as  aanvulling  tot  Nasionale  Parke;  en  beskermde
omgewings wat 'n heel nuwe konsep is en wat in  die  toekoms  grootliks  sal
bydra tot die bevordering van bewaring in Suid-Afrika.

Hierdie gebiede sal dien as buffer sones om  onaanvaarbare  gebruike  rondom
ons parke te beperk en om bewaring en toerisme te bevorder.  Hierdie  buffer
sones val dus buite ons Nasionale Parke  en  natuurreservate.  Vyf-en-tagtig
persent van hierdie  gebiede  is  in  privaat-  of  gemeenskapsbesit.  Groot
getalle mense dwarsoor die land sal nou betrek  word  of  ten  minste  bewus
word van bewaringsaksies in hulle gebiede.

Die feit dat groot areas in ons land nou effektief bestuur gaan word, is  in
sigself 'n groot prestasie en iets waaroor Suid-Afrika trots  kan  wees.  'n
Byvoordeel van hierdie wet gaan ook ekonomies  wees,  en  die  privaatsektor
wag vir geleenthede soos hierdie om te investeer en te ontwikkel.

Die feit dat die internasionale gemeenskap tydens die  onlangse  kongres  in
Durban onderneem het om op 'n groot skaal in beskermde gebiede te  belê  sal
die geleentheid bied vir sinvolle bewaring en snelle  toerisme-ontwikkeling.
Die Oos-Kaap is een van die beste voorbeelde in die land van  wat  toerisme-
ontwikkeling kan vermag.
Gebiede rondom die Tsitsikamma Nasionale  Seekuspark  wat  tot  onlangs  nog
deur armoede en werkloosheid geteister was, groei  nou  dramaties.  Toeriste
stroom na hierdie gebied, en dit sal vir die agb lede  interessant  wees  om
te weet dat een  sakekompleks  in  hierdie  gebied  R25  miljoen  per  maand
genereer - uitsluitlik uit toeriste. Die uitbreiding van  beskermde  gebiede
is net die regte sein om hierdie potensiaal nog verder te  ontwikkel  en  om
die lewenskwaliteit van ons mense te verbeter.

'n Berig in Die Burger van 17 September dat die  wet  op  beskermde  gebiede
sal lei  tot  die  uitsetting  van  plaaswerkers  is  totaal  misplaas.  Die
ontwikkeling  van  gebiede  rondom   ons   huidige   parke   sal   net   die
teenoorgestelde uitwerking hê. Wat wel waar is in  die  berig  is  dat  daar
duidelike spanning  tussen  betrokke  staatsdepartemente  is  en  dat  drog-
argumente en bangmaakstories gebruik word om hul eie onderskeie posisies  te
versterk. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

This Bill is in accordance with section 76 of  the  Constitution  and  as  a
result of a ruling by the Speaker with regard to the legality of  this  Bill
clauses dealing with National Parks are  excluded  from  it.  These  clauses
will be dealt with in a later amendment.

This Bill, together with the  Biodiversity  Act,  and  amendments  to  other
legislation  dealing  with  the  environmental,  places  the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism in a favourable position to do justice  to
conservation and tourism. The Bill also makes it compulsory for  a  register
of conservation areas to be kept and  for  managing  authorities  to  comply
with norms and standards.

This Bill will make it possible and affordable to double  the  land  surface
which is being managed by some or  other  conservation  organisation  within
five years. Currently the surface under conservation management is about  6%
of the country's surface, and this Bill will make it  possible  to  increase
this area to 12%, which will bring us in line with world standards.

The second great advantage  of  this  Bill  is  that  landowners  and  local
communities will be involved in conservation.  It  is  simply  a  fact  that
parks cannot survive successfully in isolation.  Even  the  National  Parks,
which are very well managed, could  not  successfully  handle  the  pressure
from surrounding communities.

Thirdly, this Bill will make the principle  of  participatory  governance  a
reality. The purpose of the Bill is to give communities living in  protected
areas ample scope to become involved and remain  fully  informed  about  the
management of these areas.

The Bill provides for the creation  and  management  of  conservation  areas
which include the following amongst others: special  nature  reserves  which
refer to the most sensitive areas,  for  example  islands  and  areas  where
research is being done; nature reserves which were Provincial Parks  in  the
old  terms,  which  are  supplementary  to  National  Parks;  and  protected
environments which are a whole new concept and which in future will make  an
important contribution to the promotion of conservation in South Africa.

These areas will serve as buffer  zones  to  reduce  unacceptable  practices
around our parks and to promote conservation and  tourism.  Therefore  these
buffer zones do not fall under  our  National  Parks  and  nature  reserves.
Eighty-five per cent of these areas are private or communal property.  Large
numbers of people from all over the country will now be involved  in  or  at
least become aware of conservation actions in their areas.

The fact that large areas in our country will now  be  effectively  managed,
is in itself a great achievement and something South  Africa  can  be  proud
of. This Bill will also have an economic advantage, and the  private  sector
is waiting for opportunities such as these to invest and develop.

The fact that the international community has, during  the  recent  congress
in Durban, undertaken to invest on a large scale in  protected  areas,  will
afford  opportunities  for  meaningful  conservation   and   rapid   tourism
development. The Eastern Cape is one of the best examples in the country  of
what tourism development can achieve.

Areas around the Tsitsikamma National  Marine  Park,  which  until  recently
were ravaged by poverty and unemployment,  are  now  growing  dramaticallly.
Tourists are streaming to this area, and it  will  be  interesting  for  hon
members to know that  one  business  complex  in  this  area  generates  R25
million per month - solely from tourists. The extension of  protected  areas
is just the right signal to develop this potential further  and  to  improve
the quality of life of our people.

An article in Die Burger of 17 September  saying  that  the  legislation  on
protected areas will lead  to  the  eviction  of  farm  workers  is  totally
misplaced. The development of areas around our current parks will  have  the
opposite effect. What is true in  the  article  is  that  there  is  obvious
tension between the relevant state departments and that false arguments  and
scare stories are being used to strengthen their respective positions.]
Speaker, there are areas of concern. The issue of mining in protected  areas
remains a major problem. The committee and  the  Minister  have  stood  firm
that no new mining rights will be given in protected  areas.  The  DA  fully
supports this view.

Mining in the Richtersveld did create a major  problem  for  the  committee.
The Richtersveld community has a contractual  agreement  to  jointly  manage
this national park. Mining is taking place in the park,  but  the  community
has no mining  rights.  Unfortunately  the  hopes  and  aspirations  of  the
community could not be accommodated in this Bill, but it is  generally  felt
that somehow the benefits  of  mining  must  also  assist  the  Richtersveld
community.

The threat of dune mining in Pondoland remains a huge concern, and  we  urge
the Minister never to agree to the destruction of one of the most  beautiful
areas in South Africa.

Poaching  of  our  resources  remains  a  major  problem.  As  far  as   the
destruction of our perlemoen resource is concerned, it is  a  disgrace  that
Government cannot protect this resource. It is  unbelievable  that  we  have
the capacity to host the World Summit on  Sustainable  Development  and  the
World Parks congress, yet we cannot stop the destruction  of  our  perlemoen
reserve.

No government with self-respect can allow the Mafia-type  triads  to  create
no-go areas where the authorities are too scared to enforce the law. The  DA
urges the Minister to declare some areas, where there  are  still  perlemoen
beds left, as protected areas, and allow no  harvesting  activity  in  these
areas.

The same principle applies  to  certain  fish  species  that  urgently  need
protection, and we request the Minister to  create  more  marine  parks.  At
present 12% of the world's land area enjoys protected status, yet less  than
1% of the world's oceans are protected. This  is  a  clear  indication  that
much more attention should be given to marine protection.

I would like to thank our chairperson for the  competent  and  fair  way  in
which she led the committee. Special thanks to Ms  Yako  and  her  team,  as
well as the lawyer who assisted the committee.

The DA supports the Bill.

Mrs R A NDZANGA: Madam Speaker, hon Minister, under  the  apartheid  regime,
the establishment and expansion of parks in our country was  accompanied  by
severe hardships. Apartheid policies discriminated  against  South  Africans
on the basis of the colour of their skins.  Apartheid  denied  black  people
the right to work and live where they chose. As though  it  was  not  enough
for  that  so-called  Christian  government  of  apartheid  to  discriminate
against people on colour lines, language and ethnic groupings were  used  by
the apartheid government to divide black people.

When the Kruger National Park was established, the Makuleke  community,  who
occupied land near the junction of the  Limpopo  and  Luvuvhu  Rivers,  were
forcibly removed from their land. Their homes, which were on the land  where
they had lived in peace for many years, had  to  make  way  for  the  Kruger
National Park. There are still scattered reminders in the  area  which  show
how the Makulekes used to live.

Please, allow me to quote part of President Mbeki's speech  at  the  opening
of the fifth World Parks Congress in Durban:


  The mere search for food among poor people, who have  limited  access  to
  various means to sustain life, has put pressure, and will continue to put
  pressure, on the national parks in poor countries.

The apartheid government used to dump black people where they had  no  means
of making a living. People lost their ancestral land and  their  livelihood.
Communities which were previously relocated to make way  for  parks  claimed
their land under the new dispensation. Their land has  now  been  proclaimed
contractual parks.

Other communities who have had their land returned to them through the  land
restitution process are the San and Mier communities in  the  southern  part
of the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park. The  San  and  the  Mier  communities
have realised the advantage of their land remaining part  of  the  protected
areas system, and they have also  entered  into  contractual  agreements  to
ensure that their areas retain national park status. The system  is  to  the
advantage of the communities.

We have the Richtersveld National Park. The  community  of  Richtersveld  is
one of the communities who have had their land returned to them through  the
restitution process and it now forms part of the Richtersveld  Transfrontier
Park Section 24(b) of our Constitution states, and I quote:


  Everyone has the right to have the environment protected, for the benefit
  of present and future generations,  through  reasonable  legislative  and
  other measures ...

The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism is  actively  addressing
the past, and is moving  towards  greater  community  participation  in  the
management of protected areas and ensuring that  the  communities  who  live
near our protected areas benefit. In this way,  we  aim  to  ensure  broader
support for our protected areas. Making our parks accessible  to  all  is  a
natural way of totally doing away with apartheid.

The National Environmental Management: Protected Areas  Bill  provides  much
greater advantages than previously. In the declaration of  protected  areas,
provision has been made for consultation  beyond  just  those  who  own  the
land. Clause 33 ensures that all persons with rights in  the  land  will  be
informed that such land is to be declared a protected  area,  and  provision
is made for oral representations by  interested  persons  to  the  Minister.
Clause 34 ensures that, in the case of land that is held in trust, not  only
trustees of the land need to agree to its being declared  a  protected  area
but the community involved must also agree.
Regarding the management  of  protected  areas,  clause  41  states  that  a
management plan, which is to be approved by the  Minister,  is  required  to
contain procedures for public participation  and  includes  landowners,  any
local community or other  interested  parties,  and  then  provide  for  the
development of economic opportunities within and adjacent to the  area,  and
the development of the local management capacity and knowledge exchange.

Communities can enter into an agreement regarding co-management of the  area
with a management authority which may provide  for  benefit-sharing  between
parties, the use of biological resources, access  to  parks,  occupation  of
the protected area and the development of economic  opportunities.  I  thank
you.

Bagaetsho, a pula e ne. [Legofsi.] [Countrymen, let it rain. [Applause.]]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Deputy Speaker, I wish to  thank  Minister  Moosa  and  the
department for putting the environment  first  on  their  agenda.  The  Bill
represents a milestone in the area of environmental legislation.

Let me hasten to add that the Prince of KwaPhindangene, the  leader  of  the
IFP, Dr M G Buthelezi, was a forerunner of the modern  concept  of  cultural
tourism and benefit-sharing tourism. Shenge! He has  received  a  number  of
international awards and accolades for the preservation of  the  environment
and recognition of the importance of ecologically sound principles.

I also want to dedicate this speech to Dr Ian Player  and  Magqubu  Ntombela
for the work that they did in the protection of wilderness areas.  The  IFP,
therefore, warmly welcomes this Bill.

Angazi  noma  ukhona  yini  ozokwazi  ukungitolikela  le   nto   engizoyisho
njengamanje: Amdokwe, amabele,  avuthiwe,  ehlanzeni!  [I  do  not  know  if
someone can interpret what I am going to say! It is harvest time!]

The birds used to sing that. Sometimes they  would  sing  and  make  certain
sounds that you would only hear when you  visit  the  wilderness  areas  and
other areas of conservation. So, what  I  am  saying  is  that  it  is  very
important to conserve those things.

During the conference that we had just  recently,  in  Durban,  one  of  the
youths who were there said: ``Oh, what has happened to the dinosaurs?  Where
are the dinosaurs? We only read  about  them.''  There  are  such  types  of
environments that we cannot see but can only read about. So, what this  Bill
seeks to do is to preserve whatever we have - in the form of plants,  birds,
and what is environmental. Thank you, Minister, for tabling  this  piece  of
legislation.

Wilderness provides social, recreational and spatial values. Hence, the  IFP
has continually pushed for its inclusion as a protected area.  A  wilderness
area is pristine nature in its  unspoilt  form  and  a  scarce  biodiversity
treasure. It is  therefore  important  that  wilderness  is  included  as  a
protected area.
Today, this legislation will ensure that South Africa takes the lead as  the
first country on the African continent to establish a system  of  wilderness
areas. This Bill has also elicited a  number  of  submissions  from  various
nongovernmental  organisations  and  environmental  groups.  In  the   final
formulation of the draft, the participation  of  all  affected  parties  has
been considered.  This  also  includes  the  importance  of  indigenous  and
ordinary knowledge.

The local communities and traditional authorities  in  the  area  should  be
part of this entire process. They are going to be directly affected by  this
legislation. So, they  need  to  know  what  is  happening  around  them.  A
situation cannot arise where all the decisions are taken somewhere  and  the
communities are later told of the decisions and how they will  affect  their
lives. These people have a  vast  amount  of  knowledge  that  needs  to  be
accessed. Their inputs are valuable.

Coupled with indigenous knowledge is the plight of  the  communities  living
adjacent  to  mines,  as  contained  in  clause  48.  Development  and   the
environment should not  always  be  seen  as  separate  issues  that  cannot
coexist.  There  have  been  instances  in  mining,   for   example,   where
development has taken place and benefited the communities while  taking  the
environment into consideration.

While this is a relationship that can work, we cannot let development  occur
at the expense of the environment. The environment must always  come  first.
Therefore,  all  activities  that  involve  the  environment  have   to   be
thoroughly assessed and carefully considered, and all  the  required  impact
assessments should take place.  There  must  be  as  little  impact  on  the
environment as possible. This is important, especially for  the  communities
who are exploited and have yet to benefit from the levies.

The various departments and role-players should  work  together  in  matters
that affect the environment. They each have their  own  special  skills  and
expertise that can assist, for  example  the  Departments  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism, of Minerals and Energy and of Public Works.

The Bill also seeks to protect areas which are sensitive to development  due
to their natural characteristics.  Social  responsibility  is  coupled  with
development. Here, I want to touch on the area of levies.  More  often  than
not, benefits that are generated from entry to these parks are not  filtered
down to the local community.

Hon Minister, there should be some assurance that those communities who  are
adjacent to these  protected  areas  will  be  able  to  reap  some  of  the
benefits. These community members have  knowledge  of  the  local  area  and
conditions that could be of great benefit. This knowledge  should  be  used.
Most of  these  communities  are  poor  rural  people.  The  money  that  is
generated as a result of protected  areas  should  be  used  to  uplift  the
communities. It  is  essential  that  we  should  now  give  back  to  these
communities. In doing so, they  will  be  encouraged  to  adapt  and  uphold
ecologically sound policies and principles. The IFP supports this Bill.
Amdokwe, avuthiwe, amabele,  ehlanzeni!  [Ihlombe.]  [It  is  harvest  time!
[Applause.]]

Mrs J CHALMERS: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister, members of  this  House,
it is with great pleasure that  I  rise  to  speak  on  this,  the  National
Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill. It forms part of a suite  of
legislation established to manage the environment in South  Africa.  Indeed,
it has been a privilege to participate  in  the  process  that  has  finally
culminated in the Bill before us - a process that  has  brought  together  a
cross-section of officials,  distinguished  environmentalists,  legal  minds
and interested and involved members of the public.

In clause 17 of Chapter 3 of the Bill it is stated that one of the  purposes
of protected areas  is,  and  I  quote:  "To  manage  the  interrelationship
between natural environmental biodiversity, human  settlement  and  economic
development." Today I will talk  briefly  on  how  those  interrelationships
will impact on the face of environmental management in this country.
In the complex realm of biodiversity nothing, as we  well  know,  exists  in
isolation. Natural systems are interwoven and  depend  on  one  another  for
survival.  Yet  the   old   institutional   arrangements   of   conservation
authorities  and  protected  areas  inherited  from  the  past  were  deeply
fragmented  and  unnaturally  divisive.  Conservation   policies   typically
mirrored the apartheid policies of the day, and aimed to restrict access  to
protected  areas.  They  were  policies   of   exclusion   imposed   by   an
authoritarian state. The challenge now is to align management  of  protected
areas with the new South African Constitution.  The  Bill  before  us  today
goes far in meeting that challenge.

One of the key words  in  current  use  amongst  those  seeking  sustainable
solutions to environmental  management  is  the  word  ``linkages''.  It  is
fundamental to the success of those solutions  incorporating,  as  they  do,
links between stratas of government - national, provincial and local;  links
in the form of corridors and stepping stones between  the  different  parks,
nature  reserves,   wilderness   areas,   heritage   sites   and   protected
environments; links and partnerships between  the  state  and  private  land
owners; linkages - and this is vital  -  between  the  terrestrial  and  the
marine environment; and, so  much  in  the  news  at  the  moment,  linkages
between nations,  in  the  form  of  our  transfrontier  parks  which  truly
represent linkages on a megascale. Our Minister has played a  critical  role
in the vision and practical realisation of these transfrontier parks.

Madam Deputy Speaker, why is it so important for  well-established  linkages
to become a  fundamental  part  of  our  environmental  planning?  For  many
reasons. Firstly, they  increase  conservation  stewardship  in  and  around
protected areas. We need to be looking outward  as  well  as  inward  as  we
plan. Management of a protected area does not stop at the boundary fence  of
the park or nature reserve. Indeed, boundaries between protected  areas  and
the  surrounding  landscape  have  compromised  integrated   and   effective
management in many ecosystems. Excitingly, many of those boundaries are  now
being broken down and innovative approaches  are  being  found  and  adopted
where community-based conservation initiatives are reconnecting  people  and
communities with those protected areas.

Secondly, linkages improve the ecological viability of protected  areas.  As
we heard at the recent  World  Parks  Congress  so  successfully  hosted  in
Durban,  the  concept  of  ecological  networks  and   linkages   is   being
extensively explored across the world. It was stated that no  park  is  ever
big enough.

In responding to this constraint, we have to face up to the hard  fact  that
because of a number of factors,  not  least  being  climate  change,  nature
needs more space. And here South Africa is at  the  forefront  of  visionary
new  initiatives  in  making  a  reality  of  the  slogan  "Benefits  beyond
boundaries", the basic principle being that if local populations  within  an
ecosystem are allowed to interact as  a  regional  network  of  populations,
their local instability can be compensated for by regional stability.

Migrating animals have never  acknowledged  political  boundaries,  and  the
formation of our transfrontier parks is defining a new path for the  African
continent, enabling our large herbivores, the elephants and the rhinos,  and
top predators, to move the large distances that were always  part  of  their
natural habitat. It provides a unique experience for visitors to our  shores
to share in this crossboundary experience.

Finally,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  these  linkages  are  not   confined   to
ecological aspects of management. If they are to  be  sustainable,  then  we
have  to  ensure  their  social  and  economic  viability.  The   value   of
conservation for so long remained meaningless for many  South  Africans.  No
longer. Across the face of our country the growth  in  ecotourism  is  being
linked to an increasing demand for local products and  crafts.  This  demand
is being used to empower  local  people  to  develop  cultural  and  natural
heritage enterprises.

An aspect of the World Parks Congress, and much commented on, was the  sight
of our Cape fynbos providing colour and  beauty  in  the  exhibition  halls.
Many had never seen a protea or pincushion flower  before.  And  there  they
were in massed display - pink  and  gold  and  orange,  really  a  sight  to
behold, and a bunch in our hotel rooms  too.  Those  blooms  came  from  the
Flower Valley Conservation Trust, an enterprise creating  links  across  the
Agulhas Plain, providing jobs and security for an extended community.

Here is an example of sustainable harvesting linking the riches of the  land
to the local community, to private  farms  in  the  area;  an  exciting  and
successful venture confirming, I believe, that we all have a role  to  play.
We must all become  links  in  the  chain,  contributing  to  the  effective
management of our country's environment. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister,  the  ACDP  welcomes  this
Bill that seeks, inter alia, to provide for,  firstly,  the  protection  and
conservation of ecologically viable areas representative of  South  Africa's
biological  diversity  and  its  natural  landscapes  and   seascapes;   and
secondly,  the  establishment  of  a  national  register  of  all  national,
provincial and local protected areas, and the management of those  areas  in
accordance with national norms and standards.

South Africa is ranked third on earth for its numbers of  plant  and  animal
species. We are hugely diverse, and thus have a  special  responsibility  to
effectively conserve and share what we have,  for  the  world  and  for  our
succeeding  generations.  The  National  Parks  Act,  Act  57  of  1976,  is
undeniably outdated and some  sections  of  it  are  in  conflict  with  the
Constitution. This Bill seeks to bring the  system  of  protected  areas  in
line with the new constitutional legal order.

The White Paper on  Conservation  and  Sustainable  Use  of  South  Africa's
Biological Diversity sets out the policy for conservation in  South  Africa.
This consolidated Bill provides one of the tools for the  implementation  of
this  policy,  by  consolidating  and  rationalising  existing   legislation
dealing with protected areas.

This Bill forms part  of  a  series  of  pieces  of  legislation,  with  the
National Environmental Management Act being the parent Bill, and the  others
complementing each other,  namely  the  National  Environmental  Management:
Biodiversity Bill, the  Environment  Conservation  Amendment  Bill  and  the
National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Bill.

The Bill before us, whilst laudable  in  its  scope,  is  ambitious  in  the
extreme. Whilst we simply don't have the administrative reach at  this  time
to fulfil many of its objectives, we must undeniably  start  at  some  place
and start here. So we commend the Minister  on  this  initiative.  The  Bill
also allows us to confirm our national objectives  on  sustainable  use  and
will allow us to meet obligations in  terms  of  multilateral  environmental
agreements that we have entered into. The ACDP supports this Bill.

In conclusion, we wish to commend the Minister and  his  department  on  the
success of the World Parks Congress held in Durban  last  week.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Minister, the MF  supports
the inclusion of the  national  parks  and  marine  locations  as  protected
areas. Being part of our national heritage  and  South  African  domination,
the life preserved in these parks needs national preservation, security  and
protection. By maintaining this, we maintain ourselves and that which  makes
this place South Africa.

The MF has no objection to the protection of  the  special  nature  reserves
for which provision is made in this Bill. The preservation  of  this  sector
is crucial to the development of our knowledge of our  ecosystems,  species,
geological and physiological components.

Nature reserves yield much revenue for us in terms of tourism.  Though  this
would have a great influence on its preservation and  protection,  it  would
be its existence as a South African entity that would be the root  influence
on its protection and maintenance.

Further support is given by the MF to a protection environment and it is  in
agreement with national parks  being  included  in  such  descriptions.  The
management of these sectors is very important and it  is  pleasing  to  know
that provision is made for this in this Bill.

It is pleasing to note that the national Government, in this Bill, calls  on
provincial and local government to  inculcate  such  policies  within  their
domains. This allows for the spheres of government  to  take  responsibility
for these areas of concern in an independent capacity.

The MF notes the importance of  the  Minister  and  his  management  of  our
national environment. After all, a healthy, clean and protected  environment
is an attraction for our tourists.

The MF supports  the  National  Environmental  Management:  Protected  Areas
Bill. Thank you, Minister.

Mr M I MOSS:  Deputy  Speaker,  Minister  and  members  of  the  House,  the
international community is  more  and  more  amazed  and  impressed  by  the
leading role South Africa is playing in all spheres of society in  the  nine
years of our new democracy.

The peaceful transition from a hated apartheid and isolated state to a well-
respected and admired democracy is one achievement that stands  out  as  one
of the miracles of our new democracy. I would like  to  concentrate  on  our
achievements when it comes to world  heritage  sites  and  marine  protected
areas.

Last week at the World Parks Congress in Durban, I had  the  opportunity  to
speak to many delegates from different countries.  I  spoke  to  a  delegate
from Ireland and asked him about their protected areas at  sea,  since  they
are an island. He told me that when  one  looks  at  the  world's  protected
areas at sea, which stand at less than one per cent,  their  protected  area
is more or less the same. When I told him about the achievements we  had  in
South Africa, he just nodded his head in amazement.

I also spoke to a delegate from the United States of America, who was a  Red
Indian, and I asked him about their protected areas. He lives in the  north-
west of America and he said that, in their area,  they  have  no  rights  as
indigenous people. He also said that they are not even being represented  in
the parliament and, when it comes to protection of the areas,  their  rights
have been taken away and they have to live from the  little  the  government
is allowing them to make use of.

To have an area declared as a world heritage site  by  the  United  Nations,
the country first has to ratify the World Heritage Convention,  which  South
Africa did in 1997. A  world  heritage  site  is  an  area  of  natural  and
cultural importance that needs  to  be  protected  for  future  generations.
South Africa has five  world  heritage  sites,  namely  Robben  Island,  the
Greater  St  Lucia  Wetland  Park,  the  Cradle  of  Humankind,   Ukhahlamba
Drakensberg and the Makapan's Village in the Limpopo Province.

Robben Island is internationally known as an island on which people such  as
our former president Nelson Mandela, Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu  and  others
spent many years  in  imprisonment.  The  sea  around  the  island  is  also
protected from rock lobster fishing. There is  a  small  commercial  fishery
for abalone, but  shore-based  recreational  fishing  is  limited  to  those
residing on the island.

The first bones of humankind were  found  at  the  Cradle  of  Mankind.  The
greater St Lucia Park is a very sensitive area with many  natural  resources
in the sea and on the land. The park is situated  in  KwaZulu-Natal  and  is
the heart  of  the  Lebombo  Spatial  Development  Initiative.  These  world
heritage sites became world heritage sites in 1999.

Our world heritage sites are unique areas of which we  can  be  very  proud.
This being the month of September, which is tourism month, these sites  lure
thousands of tourists from across the world to our country. That  in  itself
produces lots of work for our people.

The  marine  protected  areas  is  one  sphere  in  which  South  Africa  is
definitely leading. While the world has less than one per cent  of  all  its
protected areas at sea, South Africa is leading in this  instance.  Fourteen
per cent of our seas are classified as marine protected areas.

As a result of this, the fishing stocks are increasing  in  our  waters  and
that results in more fishing quotas being allocated to  people  every  year.
Thousands of people living on our coasts benefit financially  through  their
participation in fishing and by having jobs related  to  the  protection  of
these resources.

Two weeks ago, I was invited to open the Silvermine Park of the Cape  Nature
Reserve in Cape Town. It was a boardwalk  where  people  with  disabilities,
like myself, and those with hearing  disabilities  and  sight  disabilities,
could go and enjoy the nature of the world. It made me feel as  I  did  more
than 10 years ago when I could still walk and was able to touch  the  nature
around myself.

Bogenoemde is geen wonderwerk nie. Vir jare het  ons  geveg,  nie  net  teen
apartheid nie, maar ook teen die ongeregtighede wat  daarmee  gepaard  gaan.
Ons het vir ons in daardie tyd gereed gekry om nie net  ons  land  te  bevry
nie, om nie net ons mense van slawerny te bevry nie, maar ook  om  ons  land
op te bou. Dit is alles achievements wat ons  voel  waarop  ons  moet  trots
wees en ons kan net deur samewerking en deur harde werk voortbou op  hierdie
wonderwerke en geleenthede wat ons in hierdie kort tyd  van  net  nege  jaar
kon bereik. Baie  dankie.  [Applous.]  Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[The above-mentioned is no miracle. We  have  fought  for  years,  not  only
against apartheid, but also against the injustices associated  with  it.  We
readied ourselves at that time not only to free our  country,  not  only  to
free our people from slavery, but to develop  our  country.  These  are  all
achievements which we feel  we  should  be  proud  of,  and  only  with  co-
operation and hard work can we continue  to  build  on  these  miracles  and
opportunities that we have been alike to achieve in  this  short  period  of
only nine years. Thank you very much. [Applause.]]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, may I  thank
all the members for their kind words and for their  support  for  the  Bill,
and for the very informative comments that they have made.

The hon Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde,  who  is  presently  doing  her  work  as  a
tourism ambassador, reminded the House that the other day, Chairperson  -  I
do not know whether you were present - by virtue of  the  powers  vested  in
me, I appointed all members of Parliament as tourism  ambassadors.  You  are
now all  tourism  ambassadors.  [Applause.]  You  do  not  have  to  declare
anything, because it is an unpaid job  ...  [Laughter]  ...  but  there  are
duties and responsibilities that are attached to it.

She suggested that in line with that, members of Parliament should  also  be
regarded as being the forward guard of the  protectors  of  nature.  I  hope
that the portfolio committee will think about this. I will  think  about  it
and we will come up with some ideas on that and some sort of programme.

The hon Mr Le Roux has made the point about mining. I am quite pleased  that
the Bill does say that mining is  not  allowed  in  national  parks  and  in
protected  areas.  Of  course  there  is  the  problem  of  existing  mining
operations, which are very few and far between,  but  nonetheless  what  the
Bill requires is that these have  to  be  reviewed.  I  think  that  is  the
important thing, and you can be assured that we will do that.

Mr Le Roux, you have also complained about what I said about the  DA.  Later
on you spoke about the abalone resource. You suggested that there should  be
areas along the coast where there should be no harvesting  allowed  at  all.
You also suggested that certain fish species need protection, etc. I am  not
certain which province you are from,  but  I  can  tell  you  that  in  this
province, in the Western Cape, whenever Government comes  up  with  measures
to protect marine life, especially endangered marine life,  the  DA  is  the
first to oppose any such measures. That is the reality that we find in  this
province.

It is difficult to understand why the DA does that, and of course  the  only
conclusion I can come to is that the DA,  or  certain  members  of  the  DA,
think they would get votes and take a short-term, narrow approach  in  order
to oppose conservation  measures.  I  hope  that  after  today's  discussion
perhaps you would look into that matter.

It is my intention to declare further marine parks. In fact, I  have  on  my
desk, right now, for consideration, the declaration of a  number  of  marine
parks as part of the Cape Peninsula National Park. This would be in  various
parts of the Cape Peninsula, and I am giving  consideration  to  that  right
now. You can expect an announcement on that in the not-too-distant future.

I think we should also thank the hon Mbuyazi for the  music  that  has  been
provided. [Laughter.] I did not know that you are so skilled. I  think  that
the next time we have a cultural event, the hon member will be  the  keynote
speaker on the cultural item.

I am pleased that the hon Maxwell Moss has referred  to  the  facilities  in
the Cape Peninsula National Park. These are facilities that we believe  many
parks around the country  and  around  the  world  can  provide.  There  are
similar facilities  for  disabled  persons  at  the  Kirstenbosch  Botanical
Gardens. For example, if you are a blind person, you would be able to  visit
the garden and go on a walk unaided because all of  the  support  facilities
are in place there, including information about certain  plants  written  in
Braille.

Once again, South Africa is at the forefront of showing  that  outdoor  life
and the enjoyment of nature are not only for able-bodied persons,  but  also
for our compatriots who are disabled.  Thank  you  very  much,  Chairperson.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                   ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, this is  the
Environment  Conservation  Amendment  Bill.  In  the   earlier   Bill   this
afternoon, we were dealing with so-called  green  issues,  while  this  Bill
deals with so-called brown environmental  issues,  particularly  matters  of
waste and waste management.

The Bill, of course, deals with a number of aspects. I will go through  each
one of them. Before I  do  that,  I  would  just  like  to  say  that  these
amendments introduce, for the first  time,  some  innovative  approaches  to
conservation management. One of the amendments before the House  deals  with
economic incentives, which will complement the orthodox command and  control
approach to combating  pollution  problems  with  a  more  subtle  financial
incentive-based approach. I will elaborate on this  when  I  deal  with  the
specific matters in the amendment below.

It is generally accepted that while South Africa has  a  sophisticated  body
of environmental laws on its Statute Book, comparable with the best  in  the
world, we have not always been successful in policing  and  enforcing  these
laws.

In the past few months we have made considerable progress in  meeting  these
deficiencies through, for example, the  establishment  of  an  environmental
court in Hermanus, which is the first of its kind  in  the  world,  to  deal
with, amongst other things, Mr Le Roux, abalone poaching.

In the area of waste management, just this week you will have been aware  of
media reports that officials in my department have  swooped  on  an  illegal
toxic waste dump in the Eastern Cape,  owned  by  the  Mandara  Trust.  This
toxic waste dump has, apparently, been in operation for quite a few years.

The department, through its investigations, found that  an  illegal  dumping
site had been created, and that dangerous and poisonous toxic chemicals  had
been put into drums and stored in an irregular and unauthorised manner  just
under the ground. A massive investigation has taken place into  this  matter
over the past two weeks and, in fact, the police are  also  acting  on  this
matter. I am told that the owners of the illegal toxic  waste  dumping  site
will be charged, as we take this matter very seriously indeed.

The first part of the amending Bill deals with the question of waste  sites.
What it does is that it provides  for  the  administration  of  waste  sites
generally in this country, and for landfill sites  to  be  transferred  from
the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  to  the  Department   of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism. This is so that  landfill  sites  can  be
dealt with in  a  holistic  manner  as  part  and  parcel  of  environmental
management in this country and as part of the waste management  strategy  of
Government.

You would know that many concerns have been raised about  the  condition  of
many of the landfill sites in our country. We hope that with this  authority
it will be possible for us to begin to bring landfill sites into  order  and
to ensure that they work properly.

The second amendment  gives  authority  to  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and  Tourism,  together  with  the  Minister  of  Finance,  to  make
regulations which may impose compulsory deposits, or a  fee,  or  any  other
related financial measure on a  specific  waste  type.  These  are  measures
which can be extremely valuable in setting up  a  co-operative  relationship
with industry.

For example, some people have suggested that when you buy  a  new  tyre  you
pay for the tyre and also, in the price, a deposit. When  you  are  finished
with that tyre, you can then hand it in and get your deposit  back.  If  you
are too rich to hand it in to collect your deposit, we  know  that  somebody
else will pick up that tyre and go to collect the deposit. This is the  sort
of measure that will become possible through these potential regulations.

The third part of the Bill empowers Government to make regulations in  order
to deal with certain types of substances, materials and  products  in  order
to prevent the sale, distribution, import, export, etc, of certain kinds  of
products which may be detrimental to the environment or to human health.  Of
course, the most important product that comes to  mind  is  asbestos,  which
this Parliament has been concerned about for a long  period  of  time.  This
will give us the power to deal  with  that  matter,  together  with  various
other products which contribute towards waste, litter, etc.

Once again, I would like to thank the portfolio  committee  and  members  of
the  department  for  their  hard  work  in  bringing  us  to  this   stage.
[Applause.]

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Chairperson, the time reflected here  is  not  the
time allocated to me.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: [Inaudible.]

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: It's just one minute, Minister.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: We will correct that.

Ms G L MAHLANGU-NKABINDE: Thank you.

South Africa generates over 40 million cubic metres  of  solid  waste  every
year. An additional 5 million cubic metres of hazardous waste  is  generated
every year. Our capacity to store and treat these high volumes of  waste  is
severely limited.

A further cause for concern is the low percentage of  hazardous  waste  that
is disposed of properly. A recent survey showed  that  of  the  estimated  5
million cubic metres produced every year, only 5%  turned  up  at  hazardous
waste disposal sites. This means that there is extensive illegal dumping  or
frequent accidents and/or spillages. The  present  Environment  Conservation
Act does not address these concerns sufficiently, hence this amendment.

This present Act of 1989 has a strange section, section 20, which says  that
whilst  this  Act  is  an  Act  on  conservation  under  the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism, section 20 will be  administered  by  the
Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. I think  hon  members  would  know
that it is quite strange to have one Bill with two masters.

The Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs and  Tourism  has  endorsed
the transfer  of  both  the  solid  waste  management  and  hazardous  waste
management functions from the Department of Water Affairs  and  Forestry  to
the Department of Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism.  The  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry's responsibilities include the  following:  water
quality  management,  water  supply,  underground  water   management,   and
monitoring pollution that affects the quality  and  quantity  of  water.  In
terms of the new amendment, Water Affairs is  still  responsible  for  those
functions. However, issues pertaining to the physical  environment  are  the
competency of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

Water pollution is a sensitive issue since water is  linked  to  health  and
development. A strategic approach  to  the  management  of  water  pollution
should have a multimedia aspect to it as there are very  thin  barriers,  if
any, between air, water  and  land.  Therefore,  land-based  pollution  will
impact on both air and water.

The fragmentation of our existing legislation has allowed for  gaps  in  the
implementation  of  pollution  management  functions  by  both  departments.
Industry has taken advantage of this fragmentation,  and  has  continued  to
emit toxic substances into the environment. The Department of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism deals with hazardous waste  at  both  the  national  and
provincial level. Therefore, they are  well  placed  to  monitor  land-based
pollution.

Companies that operate at the provincial level are  registered  with  either
the province or the  local  authority.  Therefore,  control  at  source,  or
eliminating  the  source,  is  the  most  effective  method   of   pollution
prevention.

With the waste information system to  be  developed  by  the  Department  of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism next year, all polluting entities will  be
required  by  law  to  report  the  amounts  of  waste  deposited  into  the
environment. The system will capture waste generation from source  to  final
disposal.

Therefore, transport companies and treatment and  disposal  facilities  will
report on the waste transported, received to  be  treated  and  disposed  of
respectively. The tracking of waste will be the key benefit of this  system.
The issue of  illegal  dumping  will  cease  as  waste  generators  will  be
responsible for the safe disposal of waste once it leaves their premises.

In the Polokwane Declaration  we  have  set  targets  for  minimising  waste
generation. Therefore, this tool will measure  how  we  are  doing  in  that
regard. This is in line with Agenda 21 and the WSSD  outcomes  that  require
sustainable  management  of  resources,   waste   minimalisation   and   the
establishment of indicators for the environment.

Agricultural land contaminated with pesticides poses an even greater  threat
to the environment, regardless of having received media attention.  Most  of
these pesticides, such as DDT, are still used for malaria control  in  South
Africa. Chemical contamination  from  industrial  and  agricultural  use  of
organochlorine leads to contamination of the atmosphere and  the  long-range
transport to water bodies.

There is little value in providing drinking water to  remote  communities  -
if toxic pesticides contaminate the water - in  helping  villagers  to  grow
healthy food crops if their soil and air are similarly poisoned.  While  the
data may be available on the pesticide  poisoning  of  workers,  it  is  not
collated into a single database to sufficiently inform  the  communities  at
risks, current problem chemicals and pathways of exposure.  A  comprehensive
database will influence decision-making and policy direction.

Chemicals such as  asbestos  and  mercury  are  still  in  use,  or  are  in
hazardous waste storage sites. About 10 days ago a  truck  on  the  N1  from
Zimbabwe - I think it was destined for Durban because  that  is  where  they
take their  asbestos  -  was  involved  in  an  accident.  You  would  know,
Minister, that asbestos is more dangerous  when  it  is  broken.  All  those
fibres are somewhere around Mamelodi. I was telling  Comrade  Moses  Chikane
that when he starts behaving strangely we should understand that there is  a
lot of fibre doing the rounds in Mamelodi. [Laughter.]

We had to  travel  to  London,  Minister,  because  we  did  not  have  this
legislation and we even had to toyi-toyi in front of the  House  of  Commons
because we wanted to assist the asbestos victims of Mafefe in  the  Northern
Cape. We don't need to do that anymore, because now we have the  legislation
that will deal with this matter once and for all.

These are the powers that we should have had a long time ago.  We  were  not
here when that 1989 legislation was drafted, and that is why it  is  such  a
strange piece of legislation. Today, what are we doing?  We  are  correcting
it in order for there to be a better life for all  our  people.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr  E  T  FERREIRA:  Chairperson,  the  three  discreet  amendments  to  the
Environment Conversation Act, for which this Bill makes provision,  are  all
acceptable to the DA and we will consequently be supporting the measure.  Of
the three, the most far-reaching is arguably the transfer of the  management
of waste disposal sites from the Minister of Water Affairs and  Forestry  to
the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. We  believe  that  it  is
entirely appropriate for all waste sites, including hazardous  waste  sites,
to be the responsibility of this Ministry.

During the passage of the Bill through  the  portfolio  committee,  concerns
were raised  by  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  that  the  control  of
hazardous waste sites should  at  least  remain  their  responsibility,  the
reasoning being that hazardous  waste,  unless  properly  controlled,  could
leak into and contaminate water resources.

This argument presupposes that the Department of  Water  Affairs  is  better
able to control such contamination than this department. This  was  disputed
by the portfolio committee. To us it made  very  good  sense  that,  as  the
Minister implied earlier, this would be a holistic  approach  and  that  all
control should fall under the ambit of this  department.  But,  fortunately,
good reasoning prevailed and control of all waste sites is now squarely  the
responsibility of the DEAT.

The second provision which gives the Minister the power to make  regulations
with the concurrence of the  Minister  of  Finance  for  the  imposition  of
compulsory charges for identified waste types such as plastic bags,  or,  as
the Minister again mentioned, second-hand tyres and for deposit systems  for
these problem waste  types  is  also  to  be  welcomed.  I  hope  that  this
provision will  lead  to  the  launching  of  schemes  such  as  the  highly
successful Rose Foundation, which has brought a  very  large  proportion  of
potentially  dangerous  second-hand  oil  waste  under  the  profitable  and
effective control of that organisation.

The third and last provision  empowers  the  Minister  to  make  regulations
regarding products which,  by  their  nature,  may  pose  a  hazard  to  the
environment if and when they reach the waste stream.  Asbestos,  of  course,
provides the best example of such a product.

The final chapter of the abestos  story  in  South  Africa  has  yet  to  be
written.  The  tragic  consequences  of  asbestosis  illustrate   what   the
consequences  for  the  environment  and  human  health  can  be  when   the
processing and disposal of this kind of hazardous material takes place in  a
careless, haphazard and irresponsible  way.  And  in  this  regard,  one  is
shocked to hear that raw asbestos is still being mined and transported in  a
way which can pose a threat to the environment and human  health.  A  recent
accident involving a  large  truck  transporting  asbestos  in  the  Limpopo
province brings home the need for stricter measures of  the  kind  envisaged
in these amendments.

So we welcome these amendments and we think that they  do  make  the  Act  a
much better one. In the few seconds left at my disposal,  I  would  like  to
endorse what my colleague the hon Le Roux said about  the  manner  in  which
the portfolio committee, under the very  competent  chairpersonship  of  the
hon Gwen Mahlangu, went about its business. We find that it  is  a  pleasure
to work with hon Gwen and if the third  important  Bill  which  we  will  be
dealing with, the Environmental Management: Biodiversity Bill is handled  in
the same way, I am sure that we will get as constructive a result  from  the
outcome of those deliberations as we have had from these. [Applause.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Chairperson, the amendments that are proposed in this  Bill
are long overdue and very necessary if we want a  more  integrated  approach
to  the  management  of  waste  sites  and,  ultimately,  a  cleaner,  safer
environment. Issues involving the environment are  of  paramount  importance
and therefore cannot be taken lightly. Waste sites  have  the  potential  to
cause much damage to the environment and to people if they are  not  managed
correctly.

These sites can be a hazard and danger to the communities who live close  to
them. Most of the time it is the poor who cannot afford to  live  elsewhere.
They are the worst affected by these sites. To  children  these  sites  just
look like interesting and exciting new places where they can play  and  they
do not know of the serious danger that these sites pose to them.

With this amendment the management of waste sites is  transferred  from  the
Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry  to  the  Minister  of  Environmental
Affairs and Tourism. The Minister of Environmental Affairs  has  the  power,
with the Finance Minister's concurrence, to impose  compulsory  charges  for
the identified waste type deposit systems and associated  matters.  He  must
also make regulations regarding products which by their nature can  cause  a
hazard to the environment and human health if and when they reach the  waste
stream.

The Department of Environmental Affairs  and  Tourism  will  now  be  better
equipped to deal with aspects of  conservation  and  the  environment  as  a
whole. We hope that there will also be a more  cohesive  approach  now  that
waste management is under one department. These sites must also  be  closely
monitored. The department will  now  also  focus  more  on  the  communities
living near these sites and try to involve them in the management  of  these
sites.

They could also  use  these  sites  to  try  and  uplift  the  community  by
providing employment-creating  opportunities  for  them.  These  communities
have had to endure the hazards and dangers that come with  living  near  the
waste sites. It is time that they get something positive out of this.

The IFP supports the Bill. [Applause.]
Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, the ACDP wishes to  support  this  Bill.  We  see
that the traditional approach of  controlling  pollution  on  the  so-called
command and control approach, has not  really  succeeded  and  this  current
approach, as suggested by the Minister, whereby  there  will  be  a  deposit
scheme is a preferable approach to cut down on pollution. It is  hoped  that
this will  also  complement  existing  legal  mechanisms  by  providing  for
greater efficiency in Government's obligation set out in Section 24  of  the
Constitution, to combat pollution.

As the previous speaker also  indicated,  this  Bill  will  also  allow  the
Minister to make regulations regarding products which,  in  themselves,  are
hazardous. Regarding the asbestos issue, as Mama  Gwen  related  -  we  were
together in London and we  both  toyi-toyed  outside  the  London  House  of
Commons. It was a great experience - this seeks to address that.

Whilst we are also mindful that  the  proposals  may  result  in  additional
initial costs, these deposits will  be  recoverable.  I  am  sure  that  hon
members have witnessed the sight of tyres being burnt to obtain a few  cents
worth of metal. Clearly, this practice and  the  huge  environmental  impact
caused by such fires necessitate that such additional value should be  given
to those tyres. That will be in the form of  that  deposit  which  the  ACDP
supports.  So  we,  in  conclusion,  wish  to  endorse  the  hon  Minister's
initiative with this legislation.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the MF has no objection  to  the  transfer  of
the management of waste  sites  from  the  Minister  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry to  the  Minister  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism.  Waste
disposal appears mostly to be an  environmental  matter  and  as  such  this
transfer is appropriate. Our system of garbage disposal appears to be  well-
managed but many man-made dumping sites and littering  certainly  negatively
affect our natural environment.

The MF strongly supports recycling and hopes that a strong system  for  this
will be developed in waste disposal. The MF notes provisions made  regarding
products hazardous to the environment and is appreciative  of  this.  Thanks
go to the  Minister  of  Water  Affairs  and  Forestry  who  has,  to  date,
maintained sector efficiency.

The MF wishes the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Affairs  and  Tourism  every
success in taking  this  responsibility.  It  is  hoped  that  better  waste
management may be introduced in  the  poverty-stricken  areas,  where  waste
disposal systems are minimal. The MF supports this Bill.

Mr J D ARENDSE: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Chairperson, hon  Minister,  hon
members I often find myself using the word ``asbestosis''  in  conversation,
when I really want to say ``asbestos''. I do not think  that  this  is  just
because the two words sound so similar. Rather it  is  because  the  use  of
asbestos and the illness of asbestosis were in the news for a long time.

This past weekend, it once again space featured  in  the  news.  This  time,
however, it was about the more than 7000  claimants  in  the  Northern  Cape
finally receiving some money. The fact that they are finally receiving  some
compensation is a good thing. But the amounts that they  are  receiving  are
very low. It was reported that they are receiving between  R6  000  and  R26
000 per person or in many cases per family. One has  to  ask:  Is  that  all
their lives are worth? For some of them it has  been  too  late.  They  have
already been laid to rest.  The  rehabilitation  of  those  asbestos  mining
sites is still a matter that needs attention.

Not too long ago the committee embarked on provincial visits and we  visited
a company called Chloorkop where they found  hazardous  waste  dumped  in  a
hole in the ground and a worker told them that he was asked to  plant  grass
to cover it. The whole issue of  Thor  chemicals  was  also  given  to  this
Ministry to deal with. I remember at the time that the hon  Deputy  Minister
took centre stage in that matter.

These are only three examples why  the  Environment  Conservation  Amendment
Bill is so important. What is also particularly contentious in  the  context
of past discriminatory practices in South Africa  is  the  question  of  the
positioning of waste disposal sites. It is  the  argument  of  those  living
near to waste disposal sites, or proposed waste  disposal  sites,  that  the
establishment of waste disposal sites may  impinge  on  their  right  to  an
environment not harmful to health or wellbeing. I firmly believe that  these
amendments make it possible for the Department of Environmental Affairs  and
Tourism as lead agent  on  environmental  matters  to  ensure  environmental
justice.

Pollution, especially land pollution,  could  be  categorised  in  different
ways.  Firstly,  there  is  the  categorisation  by  activity,  for  example
agricultural,  mining,  industrial,  dumping  and  incineration  activities.
There could also be categorisation by  type,  for  example  hazardous  toxic
waste or substances; solid or liquid waste; mining waste,  such  as  crushed
rocks; mining overburdening, resulting in runoff  and  wind-blown  material;
industrial waste; powderised fuel ash from coal-fired power stations and  so
on. It could also be categorised by  effect,  for  example,  the  effect  on
health or the effect on the environment.

It is therefore imperative that we  move  away  from  fragmented  and  unco-
ordinated waste management to integrated waste management.  I  believe  that
this Environmental Conservation Act Amendment Bill is a giant  leap  in  the
direction of integrated waste management. I thank you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  what  has
been made very clear this afternoon by the National Assembly  and  by  every
political party represented in the National  Assembly  -  although  not  all
spoke, because now we have many small parties which are competing  with  the
MF for the one minute each - is that Government needs more  power  in  order
to do more  about  waste.  And  what  every  political  party  has  said  to
Government is that we are putting more power in your hands;  use  it  to  do
more about waste.

We now have the powers as Government and I think the  message  to  everybody
out there is that nothing can stop us now. [Applause.] There are  those  who
have refused to co-operate with us. But let me give you an example  of  some
who, as a result of measures we took on the plastic  bags  issue,  began  to
start co-operating because they did not want regulations.

I had a visit from representatives from Nampak  and  Consol.  They  told  me
that between the two companies they  make  all  the  glass  bottles  in  the
country. They control the whole market. And they presented to me a  proposal
of what they will do in order to recover bottles from the waste and said  if
they do that, will Government still  introduce  regulations.  And  my  reply
was: We only need regulations to control people who are  not  playing  their
part; where the pollutor is not taking responsibility for  the  cleaning  up
afterwards.

I said to them here is a good example: If  you  do  this  it  will  be  like
collect-a-can. We do not need regulations for beverage  cans  and  for  beer
cans because the collect-a-can system works very well  without  regulations.
The industry and communities are doing the  right  thing;  we  do  not  need
regulations.

We will need regulations on tyres. I just consulted  my  chief  director  Dr
Matjila who said that he will be putting a proposal before me, once we  have
this regulation for a deposit system on tyres.

When it comes to the plastic bags issue, the agreement  between  Government,
labour and business is that there will be a  charge  on  plastic  bags.  The
retail sector then decided that they were going to charge 46c  or  something
of that sort. But that was  not  in  the  regulation.  That  was  their  own
decision and then later on they started a price war on the price of  plastic
bags. We said, let's reduce the price so that  workers  do  not  lose  their
jobs. Forty-six cents is too high, so if we charge  a  lower  price,  people
will buy more bags and it will keep the factories going so that the  workers
do not lose their jobs.  At the same time, it  will  achieve  our  objective
where people will attach a value to the bags; even if it is a  lower  value,
they will not throw it way.
But the retailers started a price war, and  thankfully,  I  must  say,  most
retailers are voluntarily keeping to the system. There  are  those  few  who
are acting in defiance on their own. This legislation will make it  possible
for us to take the advice which we are now getting from the majority of  the
retailers to put this pricing mechanism  into  regulations  in  one  way  or
another.  But  I  can  assure  the  National  Assembly   that   with   these
regulations, we  will  be  able  to  move  ahead  faster  and  with  greater
confidence. And as I have said before: Nothing can stop us now.

Debate concluded.

The Bill read the second time.

   CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND LAND
                      AFFAIRS - FOOD SECURITY HEARINGS

Mr N H MASITHELA: Chairperson and hon members, we cannot talk  of  democracy
if we ignore the quality of life of all ordinary people when men, women  and
children still live in poverty. This is a challenge that the ANC  Government
is committed to dealing with. The ANC  is  committed  to  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  all  South
Africans, both black and white.

Although the right of access to sufficient food and water  is  enshrined  in
our Constitution, it was clear from the public hearings  that  the  majority
of our people still do not have  access  to  sufficient  food  as  they  are
supposed to. The report that we are presenting today emanates from the  Food
Security  Public  Hearings  held  in  March  this  year   where   about   22
organisations, including  the  Departments  of  Agriculture  and  of  Social
Development, presented their views  on  food  security.  This  was  done  to
enable  this  committee  to   make   recommendations   to   Parliament   for
resolutions.

These organisations presented diverse views on the  subject  matter  because
they represented different stakeholders, ie consumers, commercial and small-
scale  farmers,  nongovernmental  organisations,  the  private  sector   and
research institutes. We learned many lessons  from  these  public  hearings.
One of these lessons was that whilst one takes cognisance of the  fact  that
Chapters 3 and 4 of the Constitution still prevail,  there  seems  to  be  a
lack of  co-ordination  and  communication  between  the  three  spheres  of
government in terms of policy implementation and programmes in  implementing
food security.

The same problem exists between and amongst those  in  the  private  sector,
nongovernmental    organisations,    community-based    organisations    and
Government. However, for the Government this merely implies  that  there  is
only one thing, and that is that  there  is  a  need  for  a  constitutional
amendment to ensure a unified and integrated approach on  food  security  at
all levels and all spheres of government.

The second lesson we learned was that there is  a  need  for  Government  to
intervene and protect the consumer against unacceptably  high  food  prices.
However, I am aware that Government  has  already  done  something  in  this
regard. It has appointed a Food Monitoring  Price  Committee  to  look  into
this matter. What we have also learned is that the inability to protect,  to
assess and to cope with emergency situations that interrupt food  production
and supply such as droughts, floods and many others, has  resulted  in  food
insecurity in this country.

Other contributory factors that lead to food  insecurity  are  inappropriate
agricultural knowledge and technologies, certain pricing practices, and  tax
and tariff policies. Whilst we are  dealing  with  this  point,  I  wish  to
register my disappointment with the role of the private sector in the  issue
of food security problems in this country.  It  came  to  our  attention  at
those public hearings that their role and  contribution  is  very  weak  and
unco-ordinated.

We should compliment all research institutes for the report  they  presented
to the committee.  However,  the  Agricultural  Research  Council  needs  to
extend its research beyond commercial farmers to  include  indigenous  crops
for sustainable emerging and  small-scale  farmers.  There  is  a  need  for
research on alternative means of ensuring  food  security  and  no  one  can
dispute this fact, but this does not  mean  that  research  on  the  use  of
biotechnology and genetically  modified  organisms  or  foods  needs  to  be
undermined for food security.

Thorough research needs to be done so that we can have  conclusive  evidence
on the impact of genetically modified organisms on the  environment,  health
and social systems. This needs  to  be  done  urgently  as  I  believe  that
genetically modified organisms can play a significant role in ensuring  food
security, not only in this country, but on the continent as a whole.

In its submission, Afristar criticised Government  for  lacking  a  national
vision on food security by not realising there was a need for food  security
legislation that would secure and protect access to food  for  all.  I  hope
the Deputy Minister will elaborate more on this point because  I  know  that
issue has been dealt with by Government. Research  has  been  done  on  this
legislation and therefore a report will be tabled very soon.

Rising food prices, especially the massive increases in the case  of  staple
foods, are one of the causes of food insecurity. However, the root cause  of
food insecurity lies in the unequal distribution of income and  wealth  that
we have inherited from the apartheid past. In response to our  food  crisis,
the Government instituted a national food emergency  scheme  which  included
the distribution of food parcels and negotiations  with  retailers  to  sell
maize at discounted prices. The retailers actually need to be  commended  on
their quick response regarding this matter.

However, the problem with these short-term measures is  that  it  encourages
people to depend on the Government rather than being self-sufficient. It  is
on this point that we would appeal to the Government  to  spend  more  money
both on agricultural starter packs and food  gardens.  This  will  help  the
poor to farm and produce for consumption and for sale.
We take this opportunity to congratulate the government of the Eastern  Cape
for having put R20 million towards revitalising  eight  irrigation  schemes,
and initiating and improving food production programmes in that province.

In response to  the  public  outcry  for  the  Government  to  intervene  by
preventing  collusion  by  retailers  to  keep  prices  high,  the  Minister
appointed a Food Price Monitoring Committee to look into  this  matter.  The
committee  is  monitoring  prices,  but  it  is  also  investigating   price
formations along the food value chain. It  also  has  a  mandate  to  advise
Government regarding appropriate interventions to deal  with  food  security
and, especially, the affordability of basic foodstuffs amongst  the  poorest
of our community.

This committee's work has shown that there is  a  normal  time  lag  between
changes in the producer price and consumer price, which is four  months  for
most consumer prices. However, recent analysis shows that  a  downward  move
in consumer prices in response  to  cheaper  commodities  and  the  improved
exchange rate has not been met with the same drop  in  retail  prices.  This
means that food prices remain  fairly  high  for  most  households  in  this
country.

Trends in retail prices since January vary from  product  to  product,  from
retailer to retailer and from region to region.  The  National  Data  Series
indicates that the rate at which food prices increased  has  stabilised  and
in certain  cases  the  price  of  some  products  has  dropped.  What  this
committee has found is that food inflation is a complex issue  with  a  wide
range of factors contributing to price increases. To my  knowledge  this  is
still being investigated. I know that we  will  hopefully  be  getting  this
report from the Minister when this committee hands over the  report  to  the
Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs. In the  same  vein  let  me  also
announce that the Portfolio Committee on Agriculture and Land  Affairs  will
be interrogating the  interim  report  of  the  Price  Monitoring  Committee
because we take these issues and responses very seriously.

Let me point  out  some  of  the  recommendations  that  were  made  by  the
portfolio committee based on the Food Security Public Hearings.  Because  of
time constraints, I will only be  able  to  mention  a  few.  I  know  other
members are going to deal with others.

Firstly,  the  Government  should  quickly  finalise  the  research  it   is
conducting around food security legislation and ensure  that  it  is  tabled
before the National Assembly in the next term of Parliament. Time is of  the
essence on this matter.

Secondly, Government should develop mechanisms that will  enable  people  to
access  food  at  reasonable  prices.  This  may  require  the  creation  of
strategic food reserves which should be  used  when  the  need  arises,  for
example when the price of staple food is high and also at times when we  are
experiencing periods of drought.

Lastly, all forms of farming, be it commercial, small-scale  or  subsistence
farming, need to be assisted. Whether one wants  to  call  it  subsidies  or
whatever, in my view it needs to happen, because there is no way  one  would
see the development of black commercial farmers and subsistence  farmers  in
this country if Government does  not  help  along  the  emergence  of  these
farmers in general.

Some of the assistance that Government could provide is  by  acquisition  of
land, research, proper technologies, markets and extensions  at  all  levels
of government. I am raising this because in all spheres of  government,  the
extension services are very poor. I wish to appeal to  all  South  Africans,
particularly the private sector and nongovernmental organisations, to  unite
behind the South African Government and the United Nations  to  reach  their
target of reducing poverty by half by 2015.

It is a fact that small-scale agriculture  could  play  a  central  role  in
poverty reduction in rural areas in particular. As members of  the  ANC,  we
are aware that the party is doing everything in its  power  to  ensure  that
poor people have access to land and water.

We want to thank those people who have  made  contributions,  in  particular
members  of  the  portfolio   committee.   These   22   organisations   have
demonstrated that poverty is not acceptable and that we  should  join  hands
in eradicating it. The ANC wishes to recommend that this  Parliament  should
seriously consider looking at these recommendations so that  we  can  enable
our people to benefit from the product.

Mr A J BOTHA: Good afternoon, Mr Chairperson. Hon members, the issue  before
us today, is the availability of food and the ability of  people  to  access
this food.

In our country there are many who do not have enough  to  eat  and  far  too
many of these people are young children who go to bed hungry  at  night,  if
indeed they have a bed to go  to  at  all.  Not  only  are  they  physically
stunted by malnutrition, they are also mentally stunted  and  their  ability
to attend school is seriously limited.

Die ironie en die verskrikking is dat hierdie toestand heers in 'n land  wat
sulke nasionale voedselsekuriteit geniet dat dit  slegs  een  van  'n  klein
handjievol lande in die wêreld is wat 'n netto   uitvoerder van  voedsel  en
vesel  is.  Ons  sit  dus  met  die  onuithoudbare  situasie  van  nasionale
voedselsurplus aan die een kant en tegelykertyd  huishoudelike  tekorte  aan
die ander kant. In 'n moderne mark ekonomie ontstaan hierdie situasie  altyd
wanneer die ekonomiese  groei  nie  tred  hou  met  bevolkingsgroei  nie  en
werkloosheid en armoede is die wrede gevolg daarvan. Dit is die  werklikheid
en ons moenie vir onsself gedurig gaan probleme soek in die verlede  en  die
verlede blameer sonder om 'n plan te maak oor wat ons nou  daaromtrent  gaan
doen nie.

Die  vanselfsprekende   oplossing   is   versnelde   ekonomiese   groei   en
werkverskaffing. Dit neem egter tyd en bied  geen  troos  aan  die  verarmde
honger mense nie. Die res van ons se taak is om in die tussentyd hand by  te
sit om iets hieromtrent te  doen  en  wel  op  twee  heeltemal  verskillende
plekke; naamlik, in die stedelike- of dorpsgebiede  en  in  die  digbevolkte
bestaansboerderygebiede.

In die stedelike en dorpsgebiede  is  uitstekende  werk  reeds  gedoen  deur
navorsingsinstansies soos Nietvoorby  wat  die  wawieldrukbesproeiingstelsel
ontwerp het. Hierdie  plan,  sowel  as  'n  hele  aantal  ander  planne,  is
ingestel op die herverbruik van huishoudelike water  wat  water  dan  as  'n
kostefaktor uitskakel. Dit is afgesien van die  feit  dat  elke  huishouding
geregtig is op 6 000 liter vrywater per maand, en dat, vir  die  stelsel,  3
000 liter water per maand nodig is. Met die "starter packs" - skema van  die
Departement van Landbou word die koste  van  saad,  kunsmis  en  chemikalieë
insgelyks   uitgeskakel.   Daar   is   boonop   'n   veelvoud    van    nie-
regeringsorganisasies, soos wat ook deur die voorsitter hier genoem is,  wat
uitstekende werk doen om mense by te staan in hierdie verband.

Wanneer ons egter  gebiede  besoek  wat  hoë  armoedsvlakke  beleef  en  hoë
werkloosheidssyfers het, kry ons wel voedseltuine, maar  dis  ongelukkig  by
verreweg in die minderheid. Ek glo dat  die  verduideliking  daarin  lê  dat
voedseltuine nie 'n tradisionele gebruik van ons Suid-Afrikaners is wat  ons
saamgebring het van ons landelike gebiede na  snel  verstedelikte  situasies
nie, en dat daar gepoog moet word om nuwe rolmodelle  soos  godsdiensleiers,
onderwysers, raadslede, en so meer aan te moedig  om  as  rolmodelle  op  te
tree en sulke tuine in hulle eie  erwe  te  begin.  Baie  besige  mense  sal
miskien aanvoer dat hulle nie die tyd daarvoor het nie en in  sulke  gevalle
kan daar tog sekerlik gebruik gemaak word van die  see  van  werklose  mense
wat hulle omring en enige werklose persoon sal maar  te  bly  wees  vir  die
ekstra stukkie inkomste om sulke werk te doen.

In landelike gebiede is studies lankal reeds  gedoen  wat  aantoon  dat  die
oostelike kusstreek strekkende van KwaZulu-Natal deur die  Transkei  en  die
Ciskei van die hoogste droë land potensiaal in die land het,  maar  van  die
swakste benutting daarvan. Die rede hiervoor is eenvoudig dat teen  'n  baie
hoë reënval en goedgedreineerde grond sulke suurvlakke veroorsaak  word  dat
die opbrengspotensiaal hoegenaamd nie kan  bereik  word  sonder  intervensie
nie. Die boere in daardie gebiede oorleef met slegs 'n halfton  opbrengs  op
gronde wat  ses  tot  tien  ton  potensiaal  het.  Die  sleutel  om  hierdie
potensiaal te ontsluit,  is  die  kennis  dat  voldoende  bekalking  en  die
gebruik van tersaaklike spoorelemente die verandering kan  teweegbring.  Dit
is in die verlede reeds in die George-omgewing  gedoen.  Daar  was  van  die
mees brandarm mense in hierdie land wat afhanklik was  van  houtkap  in  die
bosse om te  oorleef  totdat  die  toepassing  van  wetenskaplike  navorsing
daardie gebied in die florerende lushof verander het wat dit vandag is.

Met  sinvolle  samewerking   tussen   tradisionele   leiers,   wetenskaplike
navorsers en kommersiële boere kan presies  dieselfde  gedoen  word  in  die
tradisionele stamgebiede. Al die skakels is egter nodig en  die  staat  moet
uitskei om die wetenskaplike  navorsers  in  die  Landbou  Navorsersraad  te
ondermyn soos wat nou besig is om  plaas  te  vind.  En  die  politici  moet
uitskei - en die politici wat dit doen, weet  wie  hulle  is  -  om  gedurig
kommersiële boere te demoniseer; gedurig te sê soos verlede week hierso  dat
hulle nooit saamwerk nie en nooit iets vir die land  wil  doen  nie  en  nie
patriote is nie. Ek dink daardie wonderlike uitdrukking van die wysgeer  wat
gesê het, "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel" moet mens altyd  in
gedagte hou wanneer 'n mens met hierdie goed na vore kom.

Maar miskien die heel belangrikste aspek van voedselsekuriteit, naamlik  die
na-oesopberging daarvan, kry as 'n reël die heel minste aandag. Dit  verstom
'n mens eintlik  aangesien  dit  bereken  word  dat  meer  as  50%  van  net
graanoeste   alleen   verlore    gaan    as    gevolg    van    insek-    en
knaagdierbeskadiging. Om nie eers te praat van die  verlies  van  bederfbare
produkte soos vleis en vrugte en groente wat  geberg  moet  word  nie.  Daar
bestaan reeds 'n geruime tyd 'n samewerkingooreenkoms  tussen  die  National
Resource  Institute   van   die   Verenigde   Koninkryk   en   die   Landbou
Navorsingsraad, sowel as  die  Departement  van  Landbou,  om  hierdie  baie
ernstige probleem aan te spreek, veral in bestaansboerderygebiede.

Een van die netelige aspekte van  hierdie  beskerming  is  die  gebruik  van
chemikalieë wat baie gevaarlik kan wees, veral as dit by die  beperking  van
insekteskade kom. En die geleerdheidsprofiel van bestaansboere is van so  'n
aard dat hulle nie regtig geskik is om dit self te doen  nie  en  daarom  is
dit   van   die   uiterste   belang   dat   goedopgeleide   en    bemagtigde
uitbreidingsbeamptes, wat by die mense kan  uitkom,  in  plek  gebring  moet
word sodat hulle hierdie werk kan doen.

Ten slotte, wil ek net noem dat voedselsekuriteit op 'n  verskeidenheid  van
terreine aangespreek kan word in die kort-  en  mediumtermyn.  Maar  in  die
langtermyn moet ons onsself nie mislei  deur  te  glo  dat  dit  die  finale
oplossing is nie. Slegs voldoende ekonomiese groei en werkskepping  kan  die
probleme van armoede in die moderne ekonomie aanspreek.

Julle vra altyd vir ons hier in die DA, wat ons aanbied. Ons bied al vir  'n
baie, baie lang tyd die basiese inkomstetoelaag aan. En dit is  nie  in  die
belang van ons kiesers of enige iemand se kiesers om vir die mense te sê,  "
Julle moet meer betaal om die armes te help." nie. Maar ons  doen  dit.  Kyk
daarna. Ondersoek dit. Ons is nie alleen  nie.  Die  vakuniebeweging  beveel
dit ook aan. Dink daaraan en gebruik dit  saam  met  die  ander  middele  om
medium- en korttermyn aspekte aan te spreek.

Maar kyk tog asseblief in  die  langtermyn  na  net  een  aspek  en  dit  is
ekonomiese groei. En ek wil ten  slotte  die  Adjunkminister  tog  mooi  vra
vandag. Dink mooi wat ek vandag hier gesê het. Moenie maak soos  in  verlede
week se debat en my kom beskuldig dat ek teen iets is as ek probleme  uitwys
nie. Ek is nie ten gunste  van  armoede  nie.  Ek  is  nie  ten  gunste  van
hongersnood nie. Ek is ten gunste van die oplossing  daarvan.  Baie  dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The irony and the horror of this is that this situation is prevailing in  a
country that enjoys such food security that it is one of only a  handful  of
countries in the world that  is  a  net  exporter  of  food  and  fibre.  We
therefore have the unbearable situation of a national food  surplus  on  the
one hand and simultaneously household shortages on the other.  In  a  modern
market economy a situation such as this always arises when  economic  growth
does not keep pace with population growth, and unemployment and poverty  are
the cruel results. This is the reality and we should not constantly  go  and
look for problems in the past and blame the past without devising a plan  as
to what we are going to do about it now.

The obvious solution is accelerated economic growth and provision  of  jobs.
This, however, takes time and  provides  no  solace  for  the  impoverished,
hungry people. The task of the rest of us is to lend a hand in the  meantime
to do something about this and in fact in two  completely  different  areas;
namely, in the urban or  peri-urban  areas  and  in  the  densely  populated
subsistence farming areas.

In the urban and peri-urban areas excellent work has already  been  done  by
research institutions such  as  Nietvoorby,  that  designed  the  wagonwheel
pressure irrigation system. This plan, as well as a number of  other  plans,
are focused on recycling household water, which eliminates water as  a  cost
factor. This is irrespective of the fact that every  household  is  entitled
to 6 000 litres of free water per month and that the system  requires  3 000
litres per month. With the ``starter packs'' scheme  of  the  Department  of
Agriculture  the  cost  of  seed,  fertiliser  and  chemicals  is  similarly
eliminated.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  multiplicity   of   nongovernmental
organisations, as was also mentioned  here  by  the  chairperson,  that  are
doing excellent work to assist people in this regard.

However, when we visit areas that are experiencing high  levels  of  poverty
and  have  high  unemployment  rates,  we  do   find   food   gardens,   but
unfortunately these  are  in  the  minority  by  far.  I  believe  that  the
explanation lies in the fact that food gardens are not a traditional  custom
of South Africans that we have brought with  us  from  our  rural  areas  to
rapidly  urbanised  situations,  and  that  an  effort  should  be  made  to
encourage new role models such  as  religious  leaders,  educators,  council
members, and so forth to act as role models and start such gardens in  their
own yards. Many busy individuals would probably  argue  that  they  did  not
have the time for that and in such cases surely they could use  the  sea  of
unemployed people that surround them and  any  unemployed  person  would  be
only too pleased to have the opportunity to earn a  little  extra  money  by
doing such work.

In rural areas studies have been conducted long ago that indicate  that  the
Eastern coastline, stretching from KwaZulu-Natal through  the  Transkei  and
the Ciskei, has among the highest dry land potential  in  the  country,  but
among the poorest utilisation. The reason for this is  simply  that  a  very
high rainfall and well-drained soil creates such high acid levels  that  the
yield  apotential  simply  cannot  be  achieved  without  intervention.  The
farmers in those areas manage to produce only half a ton on  land  that  has
the potential to produce  six  to  ten  tons.  The  key  to  unlocking  this
potential  is  the  knowledge  that   sufficient   calcification   and   the
utilisation of relevant trace elements can bring about the change. This  has
already been done in the George  region  in  the  past.  Some  of  the  most
indigent people in this country who relied on  logging  in  the  forests  to
survive, lived there until the application of scientific research  converted
that area into the flourishing paradise that it is today.

With  meaningful  co-operation  between  traditional   leaders,   scientific
researchers and commercial farmers exactly the  same  can  be  done  in  the
traditional tribal areas. All the links  are  necessary,  however,  and  the
state  has  to  stop  undermining  the   scientific   researchers   in   the
Agricultural Research Council  as  is  taking  place  at  present.  And  the
politicians must stop - and those politicians who are doing  this  know  who
they are - continually demonising commercial farmers;  continually  stating,
as happened here last week, that they never co-operate and never want to  do
their bit for the country and that they  are  not  patriots.  I  think  that
wonderful expression by the philosopher who said  "Patriotism  is  the  last
refuge of a scoundrel" should always be kept in  mind  when  one  comes  out
with such things.

But probably the most important aspect of food security,  namely  its  post-
harvest storage, as a rule enjoys the  least  attention.  This  is  actually
astounding, since it is estimated that  more  that  50%  of  grain  harvests
alone go to waste as a result of insect and rodent damage.  Not  to  mention
the loss of perishable products such as meat and fruit and  vegetables  that
must be stored. For  quite  a  while  now  there  has  been  a  co-operation
agreement between the National Resource Institute of the United Kingdom  and
the  Agricultural  Research  Council,  as  well   as   the   Department   of
Agriculture,  to  address  this  very   serious   problem,   especially   in
subsistence farming areas.

One of the sensitive aspects of this protection  is  the  use  of  chemicals
that can be very harmful, especially when it comes to  limiting  the  damage
caused by insects. And the education profile of subsistence  farmers  is  of
such a nature that they are not really able to do it themselves and that  is
why it is of the utmost importance that adequately  trained  and  authorised
extension officers, who are able to reach the people, are put  in  place  so
that they can do this work.

In conclusion, I just want to mention that food security  can  be  addressed
in a number of spheres in the short and medium term. But in  the  long  term
we should not deceive ourselves  that  this  is  the  final  solution.  Only
adequate economic growth and  job  creation  can  address  the  problems  of
poverty in the modern economy.

You always ask us here in the DA what we have to offer. We have for a  very,
very long time been offering the basic income allowance. And it  is  not  in
the interest of our voters, or anyone's voters, to say to the  people:  "You
have to pay more  to  help  the  indigent."  But  we  do  so.  Look  at  it.
Investigate it. We are not alone. The trade union movement  also  recommends
it. Think about it and use  it  in  conjunction  with  the  other  means  to
address medium and short-term aspects.

But please look in the long-term at only one aspect  and  that  is  economic
growth. And in conclusion, I want to appeal  to  the  Deputy  Minister  very
nicely today. Think carefully about what I have said here today. Do  not  do
what you did in last week's debate and accuse me of being against  something
when I point out problems. I am not in  favour  of  poverty.  I  am  not  in
favour of starvation. I am in favour of solving these  problems.  Thank  you
very much.]

Mr M V NGEMA: Thank you,  Chairperson.  John  C  Maxwell  in  The  Power  of
Leadership admonishes as follows, and I quote:


  A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart  enough  to  profit
  from them and strong enough to correct them.

The portfolio committee took  an  important  decision  when  it  decided  to
conduct a two-day public hearing on food security, held on 11 and  12  March
this year. The IFP is of the opinion that  this  good  work  should  not  be
allowed to be sidelined by the fact  that  today's  debate  is  not  on  the
broader subject of food security, but  is  limited  to  the  report  of  the
portfolio committee on the public hearings.

In its submission the department, through Mr Mongwa, estimated that over  12
million people are most vulnerable to food insecurity. Today, as  we  debate
the report, the figure has risen to over 20  million  people,  according  to
the South African survey of 2002-03.  According  to  the  same  report,  the
number of people with incomes below the minimum level  is  as  follows:  62%
Africans, 29% coloureds, 11% Indians and 4% whites. Currently about  35%  of
the total population or 14,3 million South Africans are vulnerable  to  food
insecurity.

The South African Human Rights Commission paints an even bleaker picture  in
its report  when  it  says:  "The  Government  has  massively  failed  South
Africa's most needy citizens." The  report  said  that  poverty  alleviation
reached only 3 million of 20 million people living below the  poverty  line.
More than 5 million children in South Africa, 30% of those under the age  of
17, regularly go hungry, according to the Institute of  Democracy  in  South
Africa. Six out of 10 people in South  Africa  are  starving;  so  said  the
Government report in May 2002.

We urge the department to focus  its  research  on  programmes  on  how  our
indigenous communities were able to sustain production and  preservation  of
food prior to our colonialisation. We urge  the  department  to  spread  its
focus on food production right across  from  producing  food  for  household
consumption to commercial  farming.  Market  outlets  should  be  identified
prior to production.

We understand food security  to  include  food  availability,  food  access,
reliability of food and food  distribution.  It  was  clearly  stated  at  a
public hearing that the problem of food insecurity in this country  did  not
arise from lack of food, but rather from the lack of  access  to  food.  The
problem is not whether there is food or not, but that less and  less  people
are able to put food on the table due to, among other factors, high  prices,
as our food production is geared  towards  meeting  the  needs  of  external
markets.  The  department  is  urged  to   involve   all   role-players   in
implementing the Integrated Food Security Strategy.

During the briefings by the Land Bank on the 16th of  this  month,  the  CEO
indicated that South Africa would  need  to  have  five  times  the  current
capacity of the Land Bank for our country to fully  meet  the  challenge  of
agricultural development.

However, in a surprise move, the portfolio committee decided in its  report,
to advise the department to consider altering  the  existing  constitutional
arrangement regarding the current national and  provincial  powers.  Neither
the  department  nor  the  provinces  have  expressed   problems   regarding
implementation of government policies which  could  warrant  such  a  shift.
Thank you, Chairperson. [Time expired.]

Ms N D NGCENGWANE: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon members, today I  feel  proud
and honoured to be part of this debate on the food security report  and  its
impact on elderly women and children, especially after a call, or  rather  a
plea, by our President on all of us to roll up our sleeves and lend  a  hand
in the national effort to build a better life  for  all  South  Africans  by
pushing back the frontiers of poverty.

This country has a long history of poverty since 1913 when the  Natives  Act
was introduced here. It was during the time  of  the  then  Union  of  South
African Parliament that an agreement was reached to set aside  7,3%  of  the
country's total land for Africans. In 1989, when the African population  was
estimated at about 28 million, still the areas for  occupation  by  Africans
remained what they were in 1936. The unfortunate part  of  this  history  is
that not all of us in this House, especially those  on  my  left-hand  side,
who claim to be  representing  the  poor,  know  the  real  meaning  or  the
experience of hunger or poverty. There  are  those  who  read  about  it  in
newspapers and those who see the pictures of it on television.

Let me highlight  a  few  challenges  facing  this  country  regarding  food
security and their impact on women, children and the elderly. The  women  of
this  country  constitute  just  over  half  of  our  population,  that   is
approximately 52,6%, and they are the  most  disadvantaged  section  of  the
population.  Progress  made  must  be  measured  by  the  impact  that   the
Government programmes on social transformation have on  the  elderly,  women
and children of this country. When we speak about a better life for all,  we
speak about people-centred development and national programmes  which  focus
mainly on the issues of women, children and the elderly.

Food security in South Africa is  inadequate.  As  a  result,  according  to
research done, one out of every four children is  under  the  normal  height
for their age group. The most  vulnerable  sectors  are  lactating  mothers,
infants,  children,  child-headed  households,   female-headed   households,
people infected and affected by HIV and Aids and the elderly.  Most  of  the
affected people are found in the former homelands, are farmworkers and  live
in informal settlements.

Women's land rights are still limited  and  insecure.  Lack  of  information
about land rights further hinders women's ability to access land.  The  laws
of inheritance in which sons  tend  to  inherit  land  from  their  deceased
fathers sometimes leave widows without  rights  of  tenure.  The  power  and
dominance of traditional systems often deny women their rights to  represent
themselves in land claims. Women in the agricultural field  are  still  only
labourers and subsistence farmers and their role  is  limited  to  the  less
commercial sectors. There is not enough capacity-building targeted at  women
to increase their participation in  land  reform  programmes  and  projects.
Women do not have sufficient access  to  agricultural  resources,  including
land, credit, technology, marketing  and  information  which  promote  their
contribution to agricultural production.

The ability of women to claim land entitlement is variable and depends to  a
large extent on social status and goodwill of male partners  and  relatives.
Some progress has been made to  improve  the  plight  of  women  across  the
spectrum of  society,  although  women  still  lack  access  to  social  and
economic opportunities in order to improve  their  own  lives  and  that  of
their families, and those most affected are black and rural women.

The ANC-led Government has a huge task to  redress  the  imbalances  of  the
past. South Africa's new Constitution has enshrined the right of  all  South
Africans to equality. Since 1994 a lot of new laws, especially on women  and
children, have  been  enacted  to  dismantle  the  apartheid  machinery  and
address inequality and basic human rights in this country.

I  need  to  highlight  the  legislation  amended  by  this  Government   to
accommodate women in this country. Firstly, the  Extension  of  Security  of
Tenure  Act,  Act  62  of  1997,  ensures  that  women  and  children   have
independent rights as occupiers on  farms  owned  by  another  person.  This
ensures  that   women   are   protected   against   arbitrary   and   unfair
discrimination. The preamble to the Prevention  of  Illegal  Evictions  from
and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act of 1998  specifically  refers  to  women
and notes that special consideration  should  be  given  to  the  rights  of
certain vulnerable groups, which includes female-headed households.

The Land Bank  Amendment  Act,  Act  21  of  1998,  gives  women  access  to
financial assistance from the bank. The National Water Act, Act 36 of  1998,
specifies that one third of all members  of  the  water  services  committee
should be women. The Employment Equity Act, Act  55  of  1998,  outlaws  any
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender, family responsibility  and
pregnancy or HIV status. Because of this Act women  are  being  elevated  to
better positions and a better life.

The foundation has been laid and a good job is being  done  by  the  ANC-led
Government to try and redress the imbalances of the past. All  we  are  left
with now  is  the  responsibility  of  making  sure  that  there  is  proper
communication to the communities  and  implementation  is  effected  through
imbozos. Yes, the tide has turned.

In our townships we need to utilise the open spaces in our own backyards  to
plant vegetables for  our  own  consumption  and  utilise  the  open  spaces
outside the townships. We need to utilise the  spaces  in  our  churchyards,
clinic yards and schoolyards and then the women who have  vegetable  gardens
in schoolyards will assist in the reduction of vandalism of  schools  during
the school holidays, because they are always visible on the schoolgrounds.

In conclusion, it is important for all of us to join  forces  and  transform
this country in real terms. We need to know that transformation refers to  a
new breeze  of  responsibility  and  accountability  that  is  blowing  open
previously closed doors to some communities in this country. Let us all  put
our shoulders to the wheel to accelerate the pace of change in  our  beloved
country. It is our responsibility, all of us, to break down the barriers  of
division and create a country where there will be neither black  nor  white,
just South Africans, free and united in our diversity in  order  to  achieve
the goals many of our leaders fought and died for in order to  be  where  we
are today with this democracy. I thank you.

Mnr   A   S   VAN   DER   MERWE:   Voorsitter,   agb   Minister,   kollegas,
voedselsekuriteit is 'n lywige onderwerp. Dit  is  ook  'n  baie  belangrike
onderwerp wat alle mense in Suid-Afrika raak.

My tyd is te min, maar ek wil tog net dít uitspreek. Dit lyk nie of  dit  'n
belangrike onderwerp is nie as ek na die  teenwoordigheid  in  hierdie  Raad
kyk nie. Daar is  twee  sake:  Genoeg  voedsel  en  die  beskikbaarheid  van
voedsel aan almal. Ten spyte daarvan dat  Suid-Afrika  'n  landbou-arm  land
is, het ons landbouers so effektief geopereer dat daar nog nooit  'n  tekort
aan voedsel was nie en voedsel teen 'n billike prys geproduseer is.  Miskien
het ons so gewoond daaraan geraak dat ons  dit  nie  meer  as  'n  prestasie
beskou nie. Suid-Afrika is maar een van sewe lande wat 'n  netto  uitvoerder
van voedsel is. Die groot verantwoordelikheid is om dit so te hou.

Om dit so te hou, is daar 'n paar sake van dringende belang wat aandag  moet
kry. Ek lig net 'n paar uit. Landbou in Suid-Afrika kry geen  staatsubsidies
nie. Dit is goed so, want subsidies verwring die ekonomie. Dit is egter  van
die uiterste belang dat landbouers beskerm word  teen  subsidies  van  ander
lande. Pick 'n Pay voer honderde kilo's  gesubsidieerde kaas in teen  R16,00
per kilo. Hoekom laat  ons  dit  toe?  Hoeveel  werksgeleenthede  gaan  deur
hierdie soort invoere verlore? Bereik dit die armste  van  arm  mense?  Nee,
dit bereik nie eers die gemiddelde verbruiker nie. Waar is ons  patriotisme?


Landbounavorsing bestaan amper nie meer nie. Ons  moet  nuwe  boere  vestig.
Hulle benodig die heel beste tegnologie om met die wêreld  te  kan  meeding.
Kom die Regering en ons almal  ons  verantwoordelikheid  na?  Grondbelasting
word  sonder  reëls  op  die  landbou  losgelaat.  Die  impak  van   hierdie
ongereguleerde belasting  is  nog  nie  eers  bereken  deur  die  instelling
daarvan nie. Ek is ten gunste van minimumlone, maar ook hier lyk dit of  die
Regering  so  gretig  was  om  dit  ingestel  te  kry  dat   die   praktiese
implementering glad nie in ag geneem  is  nie.  Al  hierdie  goed  vernietig
werksgeleenthede. Ek het maar net geraak aan 'n paar  punte  wat  van  groot
belang is om voedsel teen bekostigbare pryse te produseer.

Ek vra asseblief: Moet nie die gans wat die goue  eiers  lê  slag  nie.  Dit
gaan voedselsekuriteit uiters nadelig raak. 'n  Baie  belangrike  faset  oor
voedselsekuriteit wat uit die  verhore  mooi  na  vore  gekom  het,  is  die
beskikbaarheid van basiese voedsel aan ons heel armste mense van  ons  land.
Ek wil 'n beroep doen op ons groot  kettingwinkels  en  hulle  baie  bekwame
personeel om te gaan saam sit en met planne  na  vore  te  kom  wat  basiese
voedsel aan die afgeleë verbruikers, wat  meestal  uit  arm  mense  bestaan,
goedkoper beskikbaar te stel. Ons kettingwinkelgroepe is van die  beste  ter
wêreld en ek glo hulle kan  ook  hier  'n  groot  bydrae  lewer.  Hulle  het
kundigheid. Hulle het fondse. Help asseblief.

Die staat het ook  'n  verantwoordelikheid  om  deur  verantwoordelike  hulp
basiese voedsel bekostigbaar vir arm mense te maak. Voor ons dit nie  bereik
nie,  het  ons  nie  volledige   voedselsekuriteit   bereik   nie.   Dankie.
(Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A S VAN DER MERWE: Chairperson, hon Minister, colleagues, food  security
is a weighty subject. It is also a  very  important  subject  that  concerns
everyone in South Africa.

My time is too limited, but I would just like to say this. It does not  seem
to be an important subject if I look at the attendance in this House.  There
are two issues: Sufficient food and the availability of  food  to  everyone.
Despite the fact that South Africa is an agriculturally  poor  country,  our
farmers have operated so effectively that there has never  been  a  shortage
of food and food has been produced at a  reasonable  price.  Maybe  we  have
become so accustomed to this that we no longer consider it  an  achievement.
South Africa is one of only seven countries that are net exporters of  food.
The big responsibility is to maintain this.

To keep this up, there are a few urgent matters that  require  attention.  I
shall single out only a few of them. Agriculture in South  Africa  does  not
receive any subsidies  from  the  state.  This  is  a  good  thing,  because
subsidies distort the economy. It is,  however,  of  the  utmost  importance
that farmers are protected against the subsidies of  other  countries.  Pick
'n Pay imports hundreds of kilos of subsidised cheese at  R16,00  per  kilo.
Why do we allow this? How many job  opportunities  are  being  lost  through
imports of this kind? Do they reach the poorest of the  poor?  No,  they  do
not even reach the average consumer. Where is our patriotism?

Agricultural research has virtually ceased to exist. We must  establish  new
farmers. They require the very best technology in order to compete with  the
world. Are we and the Government meeting our  responsibility?  Land  tax  is
being  imposed  on  agriculture  without  any  rules.  The  impact  of  this
unregulated tax has not even been calculated yet, after its introduction.  I
am in favour of minimum wages, but in this respect also it seems as  if  the
Government was so eager to introduce it that  its  practical  implementation
was  not  taken  into  account  at  all.  All  these  things   destroy   job
opportunities. I have only touched on a  few  aspects  which  are  of  great
importance to produce food at affordable prices.

I am asking: Please do not kill the goose that lays the  golden  eggs.  This
is going to have an extremely negative  effect  on  food  security.  A  very
important facet of food security that came  to  the  fore  well  during  the
hearings is the availability of basic food to the poorest  of  the  poor  in
our country. I want to appeal  to  our  big  chain  stores  and  their  very
competent personnel to sit down together and come up with  plans  that  will
make basic food available more cheaply to consumers  in  remote  areas,  who
are mostly poor people. Our chain store groups are among  the  best  in  the
world and I believe that they can also make a big  contribution  here.  They
have expertise. They have funds. Please help.

The state also has a responsibility to make basic food affordable  for  poor
people through responsible assistance. Until we have achieved this, we  have
not achieved complete food security. Thank you.]

Ms C DUDLEY: Hon Chairman, hon Deputy  Minister,  the  ACDP  is  in  general
agreement with  observations  and  recommendations  made  by  the  portfolio
committee in their report on the food security hearings, but food  shortages
in Africa are  a  complex  interplay  of  many  factors  including  drought,
poverty,  lack  of  transport  and  storage  infrastructure  and   political
instability.

An important issue which the ACDP  believes  should  have  received  greater
emphasis is genetically modified  crops.  Genetic  engineering  has  serious
implications for sustainable agriculture and food security and cannot  offer
solutions in Africa. There is increasing concern over the  potential  health
and environmental hazards posed by genetically  engineered  seeds.  Lack  of
genetic diversity, increasing vulnerability to pests and  disease,  monopoly
control of seeds resulting in fewer types of  seeds  being  available,  gene
transfer to domestic relatives and wild plants producing  super  weeds,  are
some of the concerns.

For centuries farmers have followed a  tradition  of  saving,  adapting  and
exchanging seed which has promoted biodiversity  and  food  security.  If  a
farmer loses the ability to save seed, he or she cannot continue  to  select
plants best adapted to local conditions and needs. A  European  Union  study
states that all farmers would face high additional  and  even  unsustainable
costs if GE crops were commercially grown on a large scale  in  Europe.  The
EU presently has a five-year ban  on  approving  new  biotech  crops.  South
Africa buys and sells to the EU, which is our primary market. If  they  have
rejected GE crops, why would we even consider them? Why would  South  Africa
want to produce what people do not want?

To ignore the findings of the EU with their enormous  research  capacity  is
decidedly  unwise,  especially  considering  the  at  present  substantially
eroded research capacity of South Africa  due  to  Government  underfunding.
Even Zambia has had the good sense to  refuse  GE  maize  for  fear  of  the
health effects of consuming it  and  the  fear  of  contamination  of  local
varieties, not to mention the loss of export markets  in  Europe.  The  ACDP
commends them on their foresight in this regard.

Organic farming systems are the traditional farming systems  of  Africa  and
the way to go. If we pollute food  genetically,  there  will  simply  be  no
market. Keeping in mind that South  Africa  is  the  third  most  biodiverse
country in the world, it is unthinkable that we would  consider  sacrificing
this awesome privilege. South Africa has also managed to remain one  of  the
seven net food producers despite poor soil and low rainfall,  and  it  would
be tragic to knowingly jeopardise this outstanding achievement.

The ACDP is also concerned that new legislation, giving the Minister  powers
to expropriate land without a court  order,  will  gravely  undermine  South
Africa's present agricultural stability and, therefore, food security.  When
land has no value, no one can produce. There is no  interest,  no  food,  no
investment, no rural wealth and no  rural  development.  Government  actions
and statements which erode the value of land and private  property  sabotage
the wealth of a nation.

Food security is a matter of life and death and our  best  efforts  must  go
into ensuring that no South African has to go hungry. We  cannot  afford  to
laugh  off  suggestions  and  warnings  just  because  they  come  from  the
opposition. The consequences are too great and serious a matter. Thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, with starvation  being  one  of  the  horrific
results of poverty, and poverty in turn being one of our greatest  problems,
the subject of food security should be the focus to  maintain  the  survival
of our nation.

The MF is pleased with the committee's work as reflected in this  report.  A
vast number of important role-players  regarding  food  security  appear  to
have been consulted and many recommendations were made. The  MF  feels  that
this allowed for proper representation on the subject and  also  compliments
Abalimi, the name of which means ``the planters''  in  Xhosa.  This  NGO  is
doing great work with the community on microfarming.

Further, it is felt that whatever we need  to  undertake  to  maintain  food
security should be done. We depend on food for  survival  and  every  effort
has to be employed to make this possible. The vukuzenzele campaign  must  be
taken seriously.
The MF supports recommendations made by the committee.  This  subject  needs
extensive assistance. It is hoped that it will be  given.  We  call  on  the
Minister to please release land that  is  adjacent  to  the  houses  in  the
townships free of charge to be utilised for planting. [Applause.]

Ms E NGALEKA: Chairperson and hon members, today  we  are  debating  a  very
important subject which is a matter of life and death. The right  of  access
to sufficient food is enshrined in section 27 of the Constitution  of  South
Africa. Food security is defined as when all  people,  especially  the  most
vulnerable and least resilient, have dignified and  unthreatened  access  to
culturally appropriate food  of  a  quality  that  will  fully  support  the
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual health of the people.

It should, therefore, be noted that food  security  stands  on  three  legs.
Food  must  be  available,  accessible  and   affordable.   The   principle,
therefore, is in line with what our President said in  his  address  at  the
third African Renaissance festival:


  It is the poor themselves who must answer the question:  What  should  be
  done so that their poverty comes to an end permanently?

We have a lot of factors  which  contributed  to  the  destruction  of  food
security systems in rural South Africa. The  Land  Acts  of  1913  and  1936
dispossessed people of their land and the  separate  development  strategies
that introduced the betterment schemes were the last blow.  The  consequence
of  these  strategies  was  that  once  content,  coherent   and   confident
communities able to provide for their own food, were left hungry and  living
under conditions of immense poverty.

A further consequence of apartheid's  separate  development  strategies  was
the disorganisation of social systems on which food  security  systems  were
anchored. Migrant labour escalated and almost all the able-bodied  men  left
the villages, leaving mostly women and  children  to  fend  for  themselves.
Subsistence farming was undermined and no  small  farmers  emerged.  Working
the land was no longer feasible.

Hon members, to combat poverty the immediate underlying and basic causes  of
the problem need to be addressed and there must be short, medium  and  long-
term actions at various spheres of government and  by  a  range  of  actors.
Economic  development  strategies  and  appropriate   social   spending   by
Government are important  and  mutually  supportive  strategies  to  achieve
sustainable improvement in our situation.

We  support  the  Government  in  the  continuation  with  plans  towards  a
comprehensive social security system through the consolidation of all  other
existing measures such as the UIF and social  grants,  the  introduction  of
national health insurance and  through  the  strengthening  and  progressive
expansion of a social wage system, including the removal  of  all  obstacles
to the delivery of free basic services  to  all  in  the  shortest  possible
time, particularly in municipalities that serve the rural poor. We  know  it
is the right thing to do.

The Government's social cluster in  relation  to  food  security  is  highly
commended, as the programmes introduced have contributed  to  relieving  the
millions of our people, especially women and children,  of  the  scourge  of
hunger.

The Government's integrated and  sustainable  development  programmes,  both
rural and urban  will,  amongst  other  things,  entail  investment  in  the
economic and social infrastructure, human resource  development,  enterprise
development, the enhancement of the development of  the  capacity  of  local
government, poverty  alleviation  and  the  strengthening  of  the  criminal
justice system.

The food security strategy of the  Department  of  Agriculture  consists  of
four  subunits:  Food  production  and   trading;   community   development,
nutrition and food safety, and social safety nets and food emergency.

The Department  of  Agriculture  needs,  from  time  to  time,  to  make  an
assessment on achievements to measure the effectiveness  of  implementation.
Food security for all is  a  long-term  objective  which  will  be  attained
mainly through sustained  economic  growth.  Thus,  we  need  to  strengthen
partnerships with Government and other stakeholders  in  the  implementation
of the Government's poverty relief programmes and projects.

It is our responsibility to encourage our people to  engage  in  sustainable
self-initiated  income-earning  opportunities.  Grain  South  Africa  is  an
organisation of commercial farmers that produces grain  and  oil  seeds.  We
commend them for their role so far,  but  we  need  to  ask  them  as  South
Africans to be more patriotic.

It is every producer's responsibility  to  ensure  the  wellbeing  of  South
Africans first before going to overseas markets. Charity begins at home.  We
appreciate the role played by the commercial farmers. But what is often  not
said is that food is produced by emerging farmers  and  they  contribute  to
the food supply in this country. We all need to encourage them  and  lend  a
hand wherever we can.

Taking into account the call made by Contralesa, we  should  all  be  biased
towards rural development. The collapse of the meeting of  the  World  Trade
Organisation in Mexico is the result of the  unfair  trade  practices  aimed
against developing countries which then cause the food prices to escalate.

I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the alliance formed  by  the
23 countries like Brazil, India, China and, of course,  South  Africa  -  to
mention but a few - for their stand  to  protect  their  countries'  farmers
against these unfair trades practices of the developed  countries  and  that
these countries should continue their fight.

South African commercial farmers and black emerging farmers  should  support
the poorest of the poor by making sure that the price of maize and bread  is
controlled and that they are accessible to the poorest in our communities.

The ANC is calling for land reform to be  accelerated  while  endorsing  the
processes undertaken, including  legislation  on  restitution  and  communal
land rights. It is also committed to influencing  the  examination  of  land
ownership and usage patterns in the country, especially the sale of land  to
foreigners. This situation leads to pricing beyond  the  reach  of  ordinary
South Africans.

Allow me to say a few words on what was said by members of  the  opposition.
Mr  Botha  from  the  DA  said  that  we  should  forget  about  the   past.
Unfortunately, Mr Botha, we cannot forget  about  the  past  because  if  we
forget where we come from, we will not know where to go.

Mr A J BOTHA: I said, don't live in the past! I did not say that  we  should
forget it.

Me E NGALEKA: Ons kan nie die verlede  vergeet  nie.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  Ons
moet die verlede saam met ons  vat,  want  die  verlede  gaan  vir  ons  die
rigting gee en vir ons sê waarvandaan ons kom. Ons wil nie teruggaan na  die
verlede toe nie.

Ons  vra  nie  verskoning  vir  minimumlone  nie.  Vandat   Suid-Afrika   'n
demokrasie geword het, maak kommersiële boere miljoene rande en dit  is  net
reg dat die arbeiders wat op die plase werk, 'n deel van hierdie  geld  moet
kry.

Baie boere in die Noord-Kaap vertel vir ons  hoeveel  geld  hulle  nou  maak
vandat Suid-Afrika oopgestel is. Dit is net  reg  dat  die  plaaswerkers  'n
deel van hierdie miljoene moet kry. Baie boere is boere, maar hulle  sit  op
die stoep en die arbeiders wat die werk doen, kry nie eens  die  minimumloon
waarmee van ons lede hier 'n probleem het nie. Die minimumloon  is  hier  om
te bly en ons sê: 'n  Beter  lewe  vir  almal.  [Applous.]  (Translation  of

Ms E NGALEKA: We cannot forget the past. [Interjections.] We must  take  the
past with us, because the past will give us direction and tell us  where  we
come from. We do not want to go back to the past.

We are not apologising for minimum wages. Since South Africa  has  become  a
democracy, commercial farmers have been earning millions of  rands,  and  it
is only right that the labourers working on the farms  should  get  part  of
this money. Many farmers in the Northern Cape tell us how  much  money  they
are now earning since South Africa has been opened up.

There are many farmers who just sit on the stoep and the  labourers  who  do
the work are not even receiving the minimum wage  with  which  some  of  our
members here have a problem. The minimum wage is here to stay and we say:  A
better life for all. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  Thank  you,  Deputy
Chairperson. It's a pleasure to respond to this  very  important  initiative
which the portfolio committee has taken.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, please!

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: Let  me  just  observe
that there were a few things that I appreciated - quite a few  things  -  in
the contributions made, also by the opposition,  here  this  afternoon.  For
example, the point the hon Botha made about  post-harvest  storage  is  very
important,  because  that's  an   element   that's   always   neglected   in
developmental work. As regards the basic income allowance, he must  evaluate
what I say later on about his contribution in this regard.

I also appreciated an observation by the hon Rajbally about the  release  of
land adjacent to townships or houses. If you look at what I will  say  later
on, you will see how important that factor will be for the  programmes  that
we are working on at the moment. Unfortunately  the  hon  Dudley  apparently
had the wrong speech here today, because she has already  made  that  speech
before, or perhaps it was just some excellent cut and  paste  work  that  we
heard from her today.
The chairperson of the portfolio committee referred to the question  of  the
the right to food security - that's contained in  section  27(1)(b)  of  the
Constitution. Perhaps I could just tell him that we've commissioned a  study
by the Centre for Human Rights at the  University  of  Pretoria.  The  first
part of that report will be about the appropriateness  of  legislation,  and
we're expecting the first report from them by the end of this month, and  we
will communicate in that regard.

He also made the point about affordable food prices. The  position  is  that
there is naturally a tension between the need, on the one hand, to  maintain
high income levels for food producers, also for  new  and  emerging  farmers
and even for people who are just sustaining themselves, and  profit  margins
for traders, and, on the other hand, low food prices for consumers. We  took
some short-term measures, as you are  aware,  but  this  matter  has  to  be
monitored continually, and that's where the Food Price Monitoring  Committee
comes in, which I understand you're going to discuss, which is good.
The point is,  what  one  should  do  is  try  to  harmonise  the  competing
objectives of expensive food and cheap  food  with  the  minimum  amount  of
tampering with the free-market system. That should be  your  principle.  And
in that regard we are considering this question of  the  regional  strategic
grain reserve facility, and that discussion continues.

On the other hand there's a need -  if  you  take  that  as  your  point  of
departure  -  for  the  promotion  of  a  large-scale   household   own-food
production capacity which includes local production, storage and  processing
of alternative staple grains such as root  tubers.  That  is  the  challenge
before us and that is where our plans have now reached an advanced stage.

The third question which you must address is to link efficient suppliers  of
basic foods to targeted food-insecure groups. One such  programme  which  we
are now rolling out is the agricultural  ``starter  pack''  scheme.  Let  me
make a few observations on the context in which this scheme is to  be  seen.
You know everyone in this  agriculture  game,  and  know  that  the  Cabinet
endorsed an integrated food strategy in July 2002. Cabinet has  stated  this
to be a priority of the social sector action plan with an  instruction  that
an implementation programme be developed.

Such an integrated food security and nutrition programme has been  developed
with five pillars, of which the first is food production  and  trading,  and
that's where agriculture comes in. As you know, when food  prices  escalated
so much in October 2002, Cabinet  urgently  announced  certain  measures  to
alleviate the chronic food insecurity situation  which  had  almost  reached
famine conditions in certain areas. The point, however, is that food  relief
is a short-term response  to  save  lives  and  to  alleviate  chronic  food
insecurity situations.

Government at the same time  accepted  the  need  to  link  the  food-relief
scheme to medium and long-term  measures,  and  the  agricultural  ``starter
packs'' system, which has now reached  a  highly  articulated  and  advanced
stage, is exactly part of this objective. It's a  medium-term  measure  that
will complement the food parcel system.  That  programme  has  already  been
presented to the directors-general's cluster in the social  sector,  and  as
soon as budgetary arrangements have been  made  it  will  be  submitted,  we
presume, to the Minister for her agreement.

Adv H C SCHMIDT: Die lente is om die draai. Julle moet gou maak! [Spring  is
around the corner. You must hurry up!]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS:  No,  but  we're  also
working thoroughly. We are not going for cheap shots in the short  term.  We
are doing what is demanded by emergency  systems  in  the  short  term,  but
we're also working in the long term, because  we  want  to  end  hunger  and
malnutrition by the year 2050 in all the nodal and pocket poverty  areas  in
this country.

That will come through a small-holder and community food  production  scheme
which will also have the capacity for surplus  production.  We  must  reduce
rural poverty by 2050 by redistributing 30% of agricultural land, and  we're
going to do that. We must raise black equity  participation  and  investment
in farming enterprises and agribusinesses to at least 30% by 2050.  A  grant
funding package must be developed for this agricultural support package.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon members! Thank you.

The  DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  AGRICULTURE  AND  LAND  AFFAIRS:  The   targeted
beneficiaries of this agricultural  support  package,  or  starter  package,
will be a total  of  2,23 million  households  -  a  lot  of  people!  These
households spend an average of R500 or less per  month,  as  households,  on
food. They are the most  food-insecure  and  vulnerable  households  in  the
country, and they live in the 13 rural and eight urban  renewal  nodes  plus
poverty pocket areas in certain areas.

What we have learnt from the food parcel programme is that there must  be  a
graduation from the food-parcel-targeted beneficiaries  to  an  agricultural
starter package, whether it be on a small scale or a larger scale.  This  is
an insight that came with the implementation of the food relief  scheme  and
it will be taken into consideration.

In other words, what has been made  clear  is  that  there  will  always  be
people who will be in a food emergency situation. A lot  of  them  are  old,
critically ill or suffering from other deficiencies, or they are young,  but
if we graduate from that then the number-one  target  of  this  agricultural
starter package is small-holder  farmers.  They  are  the  next  beneficiary
group.

I'm sorry that I don't seem to be able to address all the problems, but  let
me just say one thing: What we have in South Africa at the  moment  is  that
agricultural starter packages already  exist  in  one  form  or  another  in
almost all the provinces, and they are being implemented  by  many  national
and provincial government departments, but they are not co-ordinated.

There's a lot  of  duplication  and  a  lot  of  wasted  energy  and  funds.
Departments such as Public Works, Social Development and Health are  working
on this. On the whole many of the elements of the starter package exist  and
are to some extent funded, but are not co-ordinated. What we need is to  put
down standard rules and regulations  for  key-stakeholder  participation  in
these programmes.

The  Constitution  of  South  Africa  provides  for  a   decentralised   and
democratic kind of agricultural production administration. It is not for  me
to say today that the Constitution should be amended - my views on this  are
quite well known - but the point is that the Minister  for  Agriculture  and
Land Affairs is the chair of the  Integrated  Food  Security  and  Nutrition
Programme, and the political head of support programmes of this nature.

We have to get the co-ordination and intergovernmental  relations  in  place
and working. We need a collaborative  programme,  and  fortunately,  at  the
moment, the FAO, the  Food  and  Agricultural  Organisation  of  the  United
Nations, is playing a very  important  role  in  the  development  of  these
frameworks. The problem is the budget.  Where  will  the  money  come  from?
[Interjections.] No. This doesn't come cheap.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, if you  could  wind  up,
please? The time has run out.

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE AND LAND AFFAIRS: All that I can  say  -
thank you, Deputy Chairperson - is that we need about  R1 billion  per  year
for the next 12 years to meet this terrible challenge in  South  Africa.  We
will get that money. For example, we've got money from the  closing  of  the
Agricultural Credit Board. We have about R1,1 billion available  from  that.
But we can't let people starve anymore without  putting  our  hands  in  our
pockets in this country and solving the problem. I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Mr Deputy Chairperson, I move:
  That the Report be noted.

Motion agreed to (Democratic Alliance dissenting).

Mnr  F  BEUKMAN:  Agb  Adjunkvoorsitter,  agb  lede,  baie  dankie  vir  die
geleentheid om namens Skoor die volgende verslae aan u voor  te  hou.  Weens
'n gebrek aan tyd sal ek op die belangrikste verslag konsentreer  en  indien
daar tyd is, verwys na die verslae wat handel oor die  SABS,  die  Parlement
en gesondheid. Die meeste van  die  verslae  ter  oorweging  en  aanvaarding
vanmiddag  deur  die  NV  is  die  sogenaamde  kategoriseer-Skoorverslae  of
standaardresolusies wat nie verdere interaksie tussen  die  komitee  en  die
betrokke  instelling  vereis  nie.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Mr F BEUKMAN: Hon Deputy Chairperson, hon members, thank you very much  for
the opportunity to present the following reports to you on behalf of  Scopa.
Due to time constraints I shall concentrate on  the  most  important  report
and if time permits I shall refer to the reports that deal  with  the  SABS,
Parliament and health. The majority of the  reports  for  consideration  and
adoption by the NA  this  afternoon  are  the  so-called  categorised  Scopa
reports or standard resolutions that do not require any further  interaction
between the committee and the institution concerned.]

I want to highlight the following this afternoon, namely,  the  24th  report
of Scopa, which is the  general  report  of  the  Auditor-General  on  audit
outcomes and activities. One of the main objectives of  the  general  report
is to provide an overview of the overall trends and  developments  in  audit
finance from year to year.

An analysis of the present report shows encouraging improvements in  certain
respects. For example, the type of qualifications and  emphasis  on  methods
previously recorded in audit reports  have  largely  been  eliminated.  This
includes  noncompliance  with  certain  provisions  of  the  Public  Finance
Management Act of 1999. The committee agrees  with  the  conclusion  in  the
report that this indicates that the responsiveness to audit reports and  the
implementation of the PFMA are showing  an  improvement  in  the  underlying
financial stewardship of public funds by Government  departments  and  their
related entities.

Skoor gaan ook môre 'n verslag kry van die Tesourie oor  die  implementering
van die PFMA en dit is belangrik dat ons kennis neem  van  daardie  verslag.
[Scopa is also  going  to  receive  a  report  from  the  Treasury  tomorrow
concerning the implementation of the PFMA and it is important that  we  take
note of that report.]

However, a pattern of recording problems is seemingly starting to emerge  in
certain departments, notably the Departments of  Home  Affairs,  of  Justice
and Constitutional Development,  of  Public  Works  and  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry. Each of these departments should receive qualified audit  opinions
in both the 2000-01 and 2001/02 financial years.  The  committee  noted  the
explanation by the Director-General of  the  National  Treasury  that  these
departments are complex organisations. Therefore,  it  might  be  unfair  to
simply stereotype them for poor performance in  this  regard.  Nevertheless,
the committee expresses its concern about the state of affairs.

The report reveals an increase in the number of issues relating to the  lack
of  proper  internal  control  of  accounting  and  financial  systems   and
processes. This includes matters such as  assets  management,  procurements,
employment and related costs. It would seem that several departments do  not
have adequate internal control policies and procedures.  In  almost  50%  of
provincial departments and almost 40% ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon colleagues, I think  it  is
very important that you pay attention to the report of Scopa.  In  the  past
this House accepted certain reports and you had difficulties  afterwards.  I
think the level of discussion is really causing a disruption.  If  you  will
please come to order.  I  think  the  Whips  can  help  us.  It's  a  short,
important occasion for you to be concentrating on.

Mr F BEUKMAN: In almost 50% of provincial  departments  and  almost  40%  of
national departments, the auditors could  not  rely  on  internal  controls.
Internal controls are a fundamental feature of  financial  management.  They
are critical to the overall  control  of  the  organisation  and  automative
equality of delivery of services and performance of functions.

Scopa shares the view of the Auditor-General that where institutions  cannot
provide adequate internal control  measures  to  support  the  organisation,
this presents a fundamental obstacle to overall effectiveness.  Accordingly,
the committee recommends that  departments  that  have  been  identified  as
lacking internal control capacity should, as soon as  possible,  take  steps
to rectify the matter. Progress in this regard should be  reflected  in  the
relevant audit reports, as well as the annual  reports  of  the  departments
concerned.

It would seem that  some  of  the  internal  control  problems  are  due  to
problems with the transversal computerised system,  such  as  the  personnel
system, Persal, and basic accounting system, Bas; and  the  older  financial
FMEs, as well as the general control programmes and  the  State  Information
Technology Agency - Sita. The  committee  supports  the  Auditor-General  in
calling for urgent attention to resolve this matter as it could also  hamper
the effective introduction of accrual accounting.

The next issue which I want to deal with is internal auditing. According  to
the Auditor-General's assessment, a significant number  of  auditees  failed
to comply with the  internal  audit  requirements  of  the  PFMA.  Some  had
internal  audit  functions  that  were  not  functioning  properly,  as  was
evidenced by the fact that only 30%  of  auditors  of  national  departments
placed reliance on the work of internal audits, although it  was  not  clear
in how many of these cases  nonreliance  was  due  to  difference  in  audit
coverage or whether the internal audit functions were  actually  ineffective
or both.

Internal audit functions played a vital role in the assessment of  risk  and
the effectiveness of internal control systems, including performance  audits
and the value-for-money auditing and  reporting.  The  committee  urges  the
accounting officers concerned to take corrective  steps  without  delay,  to
ensure that there are  properly  functioning  internal  audit  sections  and
audit committees in place.

As far as public entities are concerned, Scopa noted with concern  that  the
difficulties referred to  in  the  previous  general  report  regarding  the
mandate of the AG, in relation to certain  public  entities,  have  not  yet
been resolved. This is  a  serious  matter  because  in  the  end  it  could
jeopardise parliamentary oversight of those entities.  Since  it  would  not
seem possible to obtain clarity on the legal position, due to  incoherencies
in the various pieces of legislation, the committee  is  interested  in  the
manner in which the Public Audit Bill, recently  discussed  by  the  ad  hoc
committee, clarifies the position and how it brings the situation into  line
with section 188 of the Constitution.

A matter of particular concern relating to  the  15  public  entities  dealt
with in the general report, is that only  six  of  them  tabled  the  annual
reports in Parliament within the prescribed time. It  should  be  reiterated
that  reporting  to  Parliament  in  time   is   essential   for   effective
accountability and parliamentary oversight. The  committee  has  noted  with
interest the new financial management capability  model  that  the  Auditor-
General will use in future. The  committee  expresses  the  hope  that  this
capability model will facilitate and enhance the use of general  boards  and
recommends  that  in  developing  this  model,  the  Auditor-General  should
involve the relevant stakeholders.

In conclusion, with regard to this report, the  committee  is  disturbed  by
the recent tendency  of  some  accounting  officers  to  dispute  the  audit
findings of the Auditor-General when appearing before Scopa. Scopa is  aware
that departments are  afforded  sufficient  formal  opportunity  during  the
audit process to raise their concerns with the  Auditor-General  before  the
report is tabled in Parliament. This has the concurrence of  the  Directors-
General of the National Treasury and the Department of  Public  Service  and
Administration. The committee finds this practice unacceptable as  it  tends
to undermine the work of the AG.

The personnel capacity within the Public Service,  including  the  retention
of staff and the filling of vacancies - particularly vacancies  in  critical
financial management positions - remains a matter of concern. The  committee
welcomes the comments made by the Director-General  of  the  Public  Service
and Administration that the moratorium on filling of vacant posts  does  not
apply to  management  posts,  and  that  in  the  case  of  critical  posts,
departments are allowed to file an application with the DPSA to  fill  these
posts. He indicated that the DPSA has never turned down any  application  in
this regard. Therefore, the committee urges directors-general  to  use  this
tool in addressing the problems.

With regard to the other main reports, I just wanted  to  refer  briefly  to
the specific views, namely  of  the  SAPS  and  Parliament.  Maybe  for  the
interest of members, the  48th  report  of  Scopa  deals  specifically  with
Parliament.  We  as  a  committee  note  the   following:   The   continuing
uncertainty pertaining to the legislative financial framework applicable  to
Parliament. In the same way, provincial legislatures may  themselves  be  in
ambiguous positions. Given  that  the  PMFA  represents  the  public  sector
financial  management  best  practice  framework,  and  further  noting  the
absence  of  a  singular  legislative  framework  for  Parliament  and   the
nonprovincial legislatures, the committee wishes to  strongly  register  its
utmost concern with the slow  progress  made  in  finalising  the  necessary
legislation.

The absence of a clear legislative framework makes  it  extremely  difficult
for all the relevant  role-players,  since  the  continuing  delay  in  this
regard is becoming unacceptable. It  impacts  on  the  ability  to  exercise
proper oversight over the institution's task and with holding the  executive
accountable.  Therefore,  Scopa  recommends  that   Parliament   urges   its
presiding  officers  to  facilitate  the  process   of   introducing   draft
legislation in this regard within the next 12 months.
The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Order!  Hon  Beukman,  you  can  have
another minute to conclude your statement.

Mr  F  BEUKMAN:  Thanks.  In  pursuing  this  matter,  there  will  also  be
interaction with the Speakers  of  the  provincial  legislatures  to  ensure
consistency of accountability of legislatures  at  national  and  provincial
levels. That is specifically with  reference  to  the  report  dealing  with
Parliament.

The other reports have been published. Therefore,  on  behalf  of  Scopa,  I
want to ask for the support of the House.

There was no debate.

The DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chair, I move:


  That the Twenty-Fourth to Fifty-Sixth Reports be adopted.

Motion agreed to.
Reports accordingly adopted.

The House adjourned at 17:32.
