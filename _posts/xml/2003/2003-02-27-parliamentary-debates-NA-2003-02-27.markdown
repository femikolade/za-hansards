                    PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
                                    ____

The Chairperson of Committees  took  the  Chair  and  requested  members  to
observe a moment of silence for prayers or meditation.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I wish to remind members  that  the  practice
that developed to make comments and statements by way of notices  of  motion
has fallen away, as members' statements have  been  introduced.  Notices  of
motion should  therefore  be  strictly  limited  to  motions  which  members
expressly intend should be placed before the House for debate or decision.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION
Mev M E OLCKERS: Ek sal namens die NNP kennis gee:


  Dat 'n onderwerp vir bespreking by een van die sittings in die Huis  moet
  wees dat die Huis die befondsing van skole bespreek.
(Tranlation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mrs M E OLCKERS: Mr Chairperson, I shall move on behalf of the NNP:

That a subject for discussion at one of the sittings in the House should  be
that the House discusses the funding of schools.]

            POTCHEFSTROOM BEAUTIFIED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY

                             (Draft resolution)

Mr D M BAKKER: Hiermee stel ek die konsepbesluit voor soos dit  in  my  naam
in die Ordelys verskyn: I move the draft resolution  as  it  appears  in  my
name on the Order Paper, as follows:]


  That the House -
  (1) notes -


       (a)  the excellent example of the University and the City Council  of
           Potchefstroom in making their city beautiful and environmentally
           friendly;


       (b)  that their new council building is  the  first  in  the  country
           which complies fully  with  standards  to  save  energy  and  to
           counter the greenhouse effect; and


       (c)  that especially the limitation of air pollution and  the  large-
           scale planting of indigenous trees and  shrubs  sets  the  right
           example for other cities; and


  (2) congratulates Professor Johan Nel and Mayor  Satish  Roopa  on  their
       initiative.

Agreed to.

                             MEMBERS' STATEMENTS

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I wish to remind members  that  parties  will
be called in the agreed order and each member will be allowed  11/2  minutes
to make a statement. Thereafter Ministers will be given  an  opportunity  to
respond.

                      POSITIVE PROSPECTS FOR SA ECONOMY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R H DAVIES (ANC): Chairperson, it's encouraging to note that a number  of
commentators agree with the upbeat  assessment  of  the  prospects  for  the
South African economy  which  we  heard  presented  in  yesterday's  Budget.
Despite a far from conducive global economic environment, our  economy  grew
by 3% in 2002 and is poised to grow by 3,3% this year; hopefully  rising  to
3,7% and 4% in 2004 and 2005 respectively.

A particularly significant positive development was that the  third  quarter
last year saw, for the first time in six years, positive net  job  creation.
However,  although  our  economy  now  seems  to  be  on  track  to  achieve
significant  growth,  we  know  that  job  creation  and  the  promotion  of
sustainable livelihoods for unemployed people remain  major  challenges.  In
his state of the nation  addresses  given  since  2001,  the  President  has
pointed to the need  to  complement  macroeconomic  policies  with  specific
microeconomic interventions and intensified poverty relief programmes.  This
year the President highlighted the  need  for  a  significant  expansion  of
programmes specifically aimed  at  employment  creation,  the  promotion  of
sustainable livelihoods and economic empowerment.

Another important announcement in the state of the nation address this  year
was that a growth and development summit  will  take  place  in  April.  The
question that many of our people  are  now  asking  is:  What  will  be  the
significance of this summit? How is  it  going  to  be  different  from  the
Presidential Jobs Summit which  was  held  some  years  ago?  How  will  the
resolutions  of  this  growth  and  development  summit  contribute  to  job
creation and how will its decisions filter down to people on the  ground  so
that their lives improve for the better?

In my view, it's of utmost importance ... [Time expired.]

                      NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND ZIMBABWE
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A J LEON (DP): Mr Chairperson, now that South Africa no longer holds  the
Presidency of  the  Non-Aligned  Movement,  surely  the  time  has  come  to
reconsider our position in that organisation.

We say this because of the final  statement  issued  in  Kuala  Lumpur  that
applauds Robert Mugabe's land reform programme and calls on the  world  ``to
give its full support''. It condemns smart sanctions  against  Zimbabwe  and
blames drought for what  it  admits  to  be  Zimbabwe's  grave  humanitarian
situation.

We cannot be serious about promoting growth and investment in  this  country
and at the same time close ranks around the tyranny of Robert Mugabe.  Those
two positions are not consistent, and anyone who is  passionate  or  sincere
or serious about this  country  becoming  the  growth  destination  for  FDI
cannot close ranks and continue to collaborate around  the  failed  policies
of Zanu-PF.

At the same time as NAM was making these declarations,  the  UN  World  Food
Programme said that the destructive  policies  of  the  Mugabe  regime  have
created a crisis that ``is almost beyond  comprehension''.  Now  if  we  are
serious about our multilateralism, and the  United  Nations  in  particular,
and we are serious about the World Food Programme,  we  must  take  heed  of
that analysis as well. By continuing to  back  the  tyranny  of  Zanu-PF  in
Zimbabwe we are indicating that we do not care  about  democracy  and  human
rights. What we have to do is make sure that we stand up on  behalf  of  the
people and not the elite leadership of the developing world  and  make  sure
that South Africa is with the winners' circle of  progressive  nations,  not
with the club of losers of world tyrannies. I  thank  you.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

                 NEW EVIDENCE ON AIDS TRANSMISSION IN AFRICA

                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N  E  ZULU  (IFP):  In  three  general  reviews,  HIV  specialists  -
including Dr David Gisselquist, an independent consultant and  a  member  of
the HIV/Aids research team - have said that the Aids epidemic in Africa  has
not followed the normal pattern of sexually transmitted diseases.

The team has argued that  the  virus  is  more  easily  transmitted  through
unsafe injections and tainted blood transfusions than  through  heterosexual
sex. They also claim that surveys have shown that sexual activity in  Africa
is much the same as in North America and Europe,  where  HIV/Aids  infection
rates are much lower.

Their study has also identified HIV-positive babies whose  mothers  are  not
infected, which, the researchers said, suggests unsafe injections  could  be
a factor. This matter is very  disturbing  and  one  wonders  whether  these
reported proportions really reflect the situation in Africa, especially sub-
Saharan Africa. If they do,  the  African  population  faces  a  potentially
fatal situation and further research is therefore warranted. I thank you.

                         BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C C SEPTEMBER (ANC): Chairperson, in the state  on  the  nation  address,
the hon President Thabo Mbeki made the point to us that  the  Government  is
preparing a detailed proposal on black  economic  empowerment.  Equally  so,
the ANC at its 51st conference identified and resolved that  black  economic
empowerment is  a  broad-based  process  that  should  stimulate  widespread
involvement of large numbers of black people in economic  activity  and,  of
course, at all levels.

This  would  critically  include  supporting,  as  a  matter  of   priority,
collective and community-based initiatives that would include, for  example,
co-operatives. To  what  extent  will  the  proposed  legislation  on  black
economic empowerment contribute towards advancing a broad-based,  integrated
and coherent socioeconomic process; one  that  will  culminate  in  benefits
that can, of course, be shared across society and  in  particular  one  that
will cause development in rural economies? I thank you.

                             HIV/AIDS IN PRISONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S J GOUS (New NP): Mr Chair, the latest  figures  by  the  Institute  for
Security Studies that 41% of the South African  prison  population  is  HIV-
positive confirmed the  disturbing  figures  released  by  Inspecting  Judge
Fagan in May 2000 that more than 4  000  people  of  the  10  000  prisoners
released monthly are HIV-positive. We support Judge Fagan's  statement  that
these people are time bombs going back  into  society,  especially  if  they
don't receive the necessary counselling, information and treatment.

The ISS figures further support the  New  NP's  supposition  that  prisoners
have a higher HIV-positive rate  than  the  general  public  and  that  this
intensifies the risk of spreading the  virus.  This  situation  is  a  great
danger to the HIV-negative person in detention. Therefore, the New  NP  once
again wants to suggest that all prisoners  who  request  to  be  tested  can
freely undergo HIV testing and can insist on separate detention.

The recent court settlement of a person who alleged  that  he  was  infected
with HIV in prison confirms the New NP's position that it's  only  a  matter
of time before the Department of Correctional Services will have  to  defend
similar suits. It is indeed the right of any  HIV-negative  person  to  stay
HIV-negative and the necessary protection and provision in the  correctional
services system must be created, because the circumstances  are  beyond  the
detainee's control. Thank you.

                     ECONOMIC GROWTH IN LIMPOPO PROVINCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M N RAMODIKE (UDM): It becomes relevant and indeed imperative to  make  a
statement on the economic growth of the fastest-growing  province  of  South
Africa after the presentation of the people's Budget by the hon Minister  of
Finance, Trevor Manuel.

According  to  Statistics  SA's  first-ever  regional  breakdown  of   gross
domestic product estimates, or GDP estimates, released on 21 November  2002,
Limpopo province emerged as the country's fastest-growing province,  growing
at a rate of 3,8% overall, compared to the national average of 2,7%, in  the
period 1995- 2001.

Not for nothing is my province, Limpopo, known as Africa's Eden. Given  that
the Limpopo province produces 90% of South Africa's  tomatoes,  60%  of  the
national potato crop, 55% of the avos,  35%  of  the  bananas  and,  at  one
stage, it had the second-largest citrus estate in the world; and  given  the
unrivalled mineral wealth as yet untapped - which will take  another  1  000
years to exploit - and the huge influx of tourists every decade  during  the
solar eclipse and the huge influx to the Kruger National Park, we  urge  the
provincial government and the relevant provincial  departments  to  hold  on
tenaciously to the extraordinary break in the development impasse  that  the
province has since been faced with. The  revitalisation  and  rehabilitation
of the neglected irrigation schemes will boost the economy of  the  province
and will add more impressive gains. I thank you.

                     GROWTH IN TOURISM IN PORT ST JOHNS

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms G L  MAHLANGU-NKABINDE  (ANC):  Chairperson,  SABC  TV  news  reported  a
massive turnout of tourists well after the festive season in Port  St  Johns
recently. This creates the potential for foreign  capital  inflow  into  the
area. The rise in the number of tourist visits to this country  has  been  a
common feature since the advent of our new democracy.

An issue that is of concern in our constituencies  is  the  ability  of  the
historically disadvantaged communities to benefit from the  rising  tide  of
tourism. Whilst it is visible that international tourists are  visiting  our
townships, there have been few remarkable spin-offs  for  communities  as  a
whole, except for those who manage bed and breakfast outlets. The  challenge
would be how we could mobilise communities to play an active part in and  be
beneficiaries of the booming tourism industry, how  we  complement  existing
Government initiatives to  ensure  that  our  people  participate  fully  in
tourism and how we address the problem - such as that in Port St Johns -  of
underdeveloped infrastructure in areas with vast tourism potential.

It would be appreciated if the Minister could indicate whether he  is  aware
of plans that are in place or that are being considered to rehabilitate  the
tourism infrastructure in the area to attract tourism and  facilitate  local
economic development in the area. I thank you. [Applause.]

                         SITUATION OF TEACHERS IN SA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr I S MFUNDISI (UCDP):  There  is  no  doubt  that  last  year's  Grade  12
examination results were good. And there  is  every  reason  for  all  South
Africans to take pride in the  manner  in  which  those  learners  acquitted
themselves. There are, however, some  concerns,  as  reflected  in  research
conducted by the National Professional Teachers' Organisation of SA.

The research depicts teachers as motivated but that the directives from  the
department make life difficult for them.  In-service  training  in  the  new
curriculum is insufficient, the result being that teachers are  hard-pressed
to cope with their work.  Tied  to  this  is  a  shortage  of  teaching  and
learning aids. Teachers are,  however,  happy  with  the  situation  on  the
ground. They have come  to  terms  with  the  school  governing  bodies  and
principals and their relationship with parents is good.

Teachers feel that the departmental  authorities  are  rather  authoritarian
and masterful. The situation is further compounded by  the  high  enrolments
in some schools. The  teacher-learner  ratio  of  1:40  as  recommended  for
outcomes-based education is difficult to attain under  these  circumstances.
There are also complaints to the effect that  communication  from  and  with
the education departments is not up to scratch. Most teachers complain  that
they glean information from the media on issues that affect them.  Education
departments do not communicate with them  as  employers  should  with  their
employees.

If we wish to maintain or improve on last year's results, the morale of  the
teachers should be boosted and they should be  treated  like  professionals.
We, however, take to heart the commitment by the Minister  of  Education  to
the effect that he will take personal  responsibility  to  see  to  it  that
Tirisano is achieved. I thank you.

                                  SA BUDGET

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N M NENE (ANC): Chairperson,  in  his  Budget  statement  for  2003,  the
Minister of Finance  made  the  following  allocations:  R11,9  billion  for
stepping up allocations to  primary  school  nutrition  programmes  and  the
extension of the child support grant to children up to the age  of  14;  R38
billion to  provinces  to  improve  roads,  revitalise  hospitals,  purchase
medicine and school books and enhance our response to  HIV/Aids;  a  further
R6,5 billion for extending  free  basic  services,  investing  in  municipal
infrastructure,  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  and   expansion   of
employment in community services; R1,7  billion  was  allocated  for  higher
education and increased skills development, and a further R1,9  billion  was
allocated for land restitution and land reform programmes.

These and many other announcements  made  by  the  Minister  in  his  Budget
Speech reflect a turn of the  tide,  which  pushes  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. This Budget Speech was significant in that it took  concrete  steps
to ensure the acceleration of  service  delivery  to  the  majority  of  our
people. The reprioritisation of state expenditure to meet  the  basic  needs
of our people reflects a new developmental state which is responsive to  the
needs of the majority of our people.

We firmly believe that this  Budget  is  truly  a  people's  Budget,  as  it
embodies the aspirations of the majority of our people, especially the  poor
and the vulnerable. It represents yet another decisive blow in the  struggle
against poverty. I thank you.

                            CREDIT CARD LICENCES

                            (Member's Statement)
Mr S B FARROW (DP): Thank you, Chairman. It is a  ridiculous  decision  that
more than one million people, who have  not  applied  for  the  credit  card
licences by tomorrow, will have to retake their licence test.

It makes a mockery of  the  rule  of  law.  [Interjections.]  The  Transport
Department has failed in its duty to put enough manpower  and  resources  in
place to deal with the flood of applications. The department  now  wants  to
penalise law-abiding South Africans for the department's failure.

Madam Speaker, despite the fact that the  department  failed  to  adequately
publicise the urgency of the matter over the past 12  months,  it  does  not
have the capacity to deal with the conversion of licences now, nor  will  it
have the capacity to deal with the flood of relicensing motorists  who  fail
to make the deadline tomorrow.

The Department  of  Transport  has  not  taken  into  account  the  cost  of
motorists standing  in  queues  for  eight  hours  or  more  and  for  those
motorists who are unemployed and cannot afford the cost of this  conversion.
[Interjections.]

There is the added problem  of  those  South  Africans  living  abroad.  The
department should not make criminals of  ordinary  citizens.  The  DA  fully
supports the introduction of the new licence card system, but we suggest  an
extension of 6 months and that motorists  be  requested  to  report  to  the
licensing   department   in   alphabetical   order   during   that   period.
[Interjections.] Drivers in possession of  licences  issued  by  the  former
TBVC states have  already  been  accommodated.  Surely  the  rest  of  South
Africa's drivers can be assisted. Thank you, Mr ... [Interjections.]

                            DOMESTIC WORKERS UIF

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N S MIDDLETON (IFP):  Chairperson,  from  20  March  2003,  all  domestic
employers will be required by law to register their  domestic  workers  with
the  Unemployment  Insurance  Fund.  The  Department  of  Labour  should  be
applauded for taking such a step.

The inclusion of domestic workers in this fund  is  long  overdue.  Domestic
workers are more  vulnerable  to  unemployment  as  they  cannot  easily  be
absorbed into the labour market. We hope that there will be full  compliance
with the Act and that employers of domestic servants  will  co-operate  with
the department in making sure that what has been a dream  for  the  majority
of South Africans becomes a reality for these people.

I note further, Chairperson, that the Minister of Labour  is  not  here.  He
wrote me a note to say that he appoints me as a whistle-blower  on  all  the
MPs  that  don't  co-operate  with  this  department,  and  this  I  accept.
[Laughter.] [Applause.]

                           JOB CREATION PROGRAMMES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M M CHIKANE (ANC): Chairperson, in his state of the nation  address,  the
President of the Republic announced the massive extension of the  Community-
Based Public Works Programme.

These programmes are implemented by various departments  and  are  aimed  at
creating jobs  for  communities.  These  programmes  are  also  intended  to
benefit, amongst others, youths, heads of  households,  women  and  disabled
people. Through these programmes  communities  will  acquire  the  necessary
skills to be employed in other sectors  of  the  economy.  Furthermore,  the
Community-Based Public Works Programmes contribute  to  accelerating  social
service delivery.

Contrary to the aims of the Community-Based Public Works Programmes are  the
jobs for pals. They  are  designed  to  benefit  the  communities'  targeted
groups. In  KwaZulu-Natal,  in  Ntabankulu,  people  now  have  a  road.  In
Bongashi we have the taxi-rank for the  people.  In  Ndundulu  we  have  the
market centre. In Yakazi we have the multipurpose  centre.  In  Taylors,  we
have stalls for the people. The list goes on.

We hope that the Minister and other departments will co-operate  and  unlock
the resources to ensure that the Government accelerates  the  implementation
of  the  public  works  programme  to  improve  the  lives  of  our  people.
[Applause.]

                             CHILD SUPPORT GRANT

                            (Member's Statement)
Mnr A Z  A  VAN  JAARSVELD  (NNP):  Voorsitter,  die  Nuwe  Nasionale  Party
verwelkom die  Minister  van  Finansies  se  aankondiging  dat  kindertoelae
verhoog gaan word asook die besluit dat die  ouderdom  van  kinders  wat  in
aanmerking sal kom vir hierdie toelaag tot 14 jaar verhoog is.

Hierdie positiewe stap sal vir baie huishoudings 'n reddingsboei  wees.  Die
Nuwe Nasionale Party is egter bekommerd oor een belangrike  tekortkoming  in
die  verhoging  in  ouderdom,  naamlik  dat  kinders  wat  tans  tussen  die
ouderdomme van 8-14  jaar  is,  nie  werklik  sal  kwalifiseer  vir  hierdie
toelaag nie, aangesien die verhoging in ouderdom slegs geld vir kinders  wat
voor die ouderdom van 7 vir toelae geregistreer  is  en  dit  vooruitwerkend
is. Dit beteken dat baie kinders tans tussen die ouderdom van 8  en  14  nie
hierby sal baat vind nie.

Die Nuwe NP voel dat alles in ons vermoë gedoen moet  word  om  te  verseker
dat soveel moontlik kinders toegang tot hierdie toelaag  en  'n  beter  lewe
het, want te veel kinders in Suid-Afrika gaan gebuk onder swaarkry.  As  ons
nie hulle las vir hulle ligter maak nie, versuim ons ons plig. Die  nuwe  NP
doen dus 'n beroep op  die  Minister  van  Finansies  en  die  Minister  van
Maatskaplike Ontwikkeling om dringend hieraan aandag te gee  en  die  nodige
veranderinge aan te bring, sodat kinders wat tans tussen 8 en  14  jaar  oud
is en buite die net  val,  ook  vir  hierdie  toelaag  sal  kan  registreer.
Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD (NNP): Chairperson, the New National Party  welcomes
the Minister of Finance's announcement that child grants will be  increased,
as well as the decision that the age of children who will  be  eligible  for
this grant has been increased to 14 years.

This positive step will be a safety buoy for many  households.  The  NNP  is
concerned, however, about one important shortcoming in the increase in  age,
namely that children who are currently between the ages of 8  and  14  years
will not really qualify for this grant, as  the  increase  in  age  is  only
valid for children who were registered for grants before the age  of  7  and
it works in advance. This means that many  children  currently  between  the
ages of 8 and 14 will not benefit from this.

The NNP feels that everything in our power should be done to ensure that  as
many children as possible have access to  this  grant  and  a  better  life,
because too many children in South Africa are bowed down  by  suffering.  If
we do not lighten their load, we  are  failing  in  our  duty.  The  NNP  is
therefore calling on the Minister of Finance  and  the  Minister  of  Social
Development urgently to  pay  attention  to  this  and  make  the  necessary
changes, so that children who are currently between 8 and 14 years  old  and
fall outside the net will also be able to register  for  this  grant.  Thank
you.]

                   PUPIL REGISTRATION IN THE EASTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C T FROLICK (UDM): Thank you, Chairperson. This statement refers  to  the
education situation facing the Eastern Cape. At  the  moment,  165  Grade  8
pupils in the Port Elizabeth area alone are without schooling.

The children  have  all  passed  Grade  7  and  thus  qualify  for  Grade  8
schooling. The ages range between 12 and 14 years and hence they are all  of
an age when schooling is compulsory. It should be noted  that  according  to
figures released by  the  South  African  Democratic  Teachers  Union,  this
figure could be as high as 9 000 in the province.

The children and their parents find themselves being turned away by all  the
schools in the area.  The  schools  claim  that  these  children  cannot  be
accommodated due  to  a  lack  of  facilities  and  the  non-appointment  of
teachers. It should be noted that Grade 8  constitutes  the  first  year  of
high school, hence these  children  are  prevented  from  starting  a  vital
transition in their education.

Even under normal circumstances, this transition is often challenging.  With
the new school year well under way, all these children  have  been  deprived
of going through this transition with their peers. It is my  view  that  the
responsibility rests with the Eastern Cape Provincial Education  Department.
It is interesting to note  that  negotiations  between  the  department  and
Sadtu, as well as Naptosa, have reached a  deadlock  around  the  situation,
and thus require immediate attention. I thank you.

                         SITUATION OF TEACHERS IN SA

                            (Minister's Response)
The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you very  much.  There  are  two  different
topics, so I will allude to both of them. First of all, in relation  to  the
first intervention, I am pleased that there has  been  recognition  in  this
House of the improvement in the matriculation results.

This has not happened by some kind of miracle. It has  been  the  result  of
enormous  interventions  by  the  provinces  and  the  national  department,
particularly with regard to mathematics and science.  [Applause.]  We  ought
to pay tribute also to the teachers who have been involved in the  refresher
courses.

That is why I find it very difficult to  constantly  listen  to  this  trade
union reproach that the morale of teachers is falling. This is the  kind  of
wish fulfilment, where I have tried this year to say: Will the  unions  join
me on a road show to recruit teachers as a first  choice?  An  extraordinary
thing is that the results we have now received from three of the  university
training institutions is that the enrolments  have  gone  up  by  20-25%.  I
think it is important that in this House all public  representatives  should
be actively involved in saying: We want first-class, high quality  teachers.
Secondly, I think professionalism must be earned. It  cannot  be  given  and
professionalism here demands, for example, that the  unions  be  upfront  in
dealing with  issues  arising  in  relation  to  sexual  abuse  or  corporal
punishment in schools.

Why do I have to intervene with principals in Port Elizabeth,  when  I  have
no functioning there, when principals are bashing children for academic non-
performance? It is  totally  wrong.  Thirdly,  teachers'  unions  must  also
assist us in upholding the ethics of their profession.  I  am  very  pleased
that the catalogue is there, but of course you realise that we  spend  22,5%
of our budget on education. Now we must talk about the quality we  get  from
there. What is, in fact, the efficiency ratio?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, your time has expired.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: On the next question of the Eastern Cape ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister, you only have  two  minutes  to
respond to both.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: No, I was told  earlier  that  if  two  different
topics arise, with respect, I get two minutes for each  topic.  Otherwise  I
would not have taken my two minutes. I think the  Eastern  Cape  is  a  very
important issue. [Time expired.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Hon  Minister,  we  could  allow  the  other
Ministers to proceed with their responses and then we  could  come  back  to
this issue.

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Thank you, Chairperson. You are  very  courteous.
[Applause.]

                     GROWTH IN TOURISM IN PORT ST JOHNS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL  AFFAIRS  AND  TOURISM:  Chairperson,  I  will
respond to my first topic in the first two minutes. Regarding  the  question
about Port St Johns and the tourism growth there,  I  think  that  everybody
should be pleased that the recent boom that this country has experienced  in
tourism and the ongoing boom that we have has not only been  in  traditional
tourism areas but also in the Wild Coast and places like Port St Johns.

South Africa stands at this point in time as  the  fastest  growing  tourism
destination in the world. Our predictions are that it will  continue  to  be
so. The Wild Coast  area,  and  Port  St  Johns  in  particular,  has  vital
potential for tourism growth for the future and  Government  has  identified
that region as a growth area,  like  we  identified  the  Greater  St  Lucia
Wetland Park in KwaZulu-Natal as a growth area for tourism a few years  ago.
 About a year ago, the Minister of Transport and I visited Port St Johns  in
order to inspect the route of the new N2  road,  which  will  now  be  built
through the Wild Coast and go through Port  St  Johns  in  particular.  That
particular road, which now links Port St Johns up to Durban  and  eventually
Maputo, will make Port St Johns much more accessible. We  expect  that  area
to begin to develop in the same way the Garden Route has developed.

Together with the EU, we have a project for the  development  of  ecotourism
in that area. My own department will be transferring  R1  million  from  its
coffers to the region during  the  course  of  this  year.  Then,  with  the
Business Trust, there is what is called  a  tourism  enterprise  development
programme aimed particularly at making it possible for SMMEs to  derive  the
benefits of the  tourism  boom  so  that,  through  the  tourism  enterprise
development programme, we link small entrepreneurs, craft makers, and  small
bed and breakfast owners to the big tour operators. There has been  a  great
deal of success in that area. This particular area is  also  being  targeted
for training, in particular the training of tour guides.

I would like to come back to the matter which has been  raised  by  the  hon
Tony Leon, if you give me an opportunity. [Applause.]

                            CREDIT CARD LICENCES

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY:  Chairperson,  I  am  standing  up  to
deliver a lesson  in  the  greatest  of  humility.  The  function  of  these
representatives is to promulgate laws here as a guide  for  our  people  who
are peace-loving South Africans.

Mr D K MALULEKE: Chairperson, on a point of order:  I  would  like  to  know
what statement the Minister is responding to?

The MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: I am responding  to  the  statement  on
the matter of the drivers' licences.

Mr D K MALULEKE: Now according to  the  Rules,  Mr  Chair,  that  particular
issue is related to transportation, and this is the Minister for Safety  and
Security. [Interjections.]

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: May I respond?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Give us a minute, Minister. I appeal  to  the
hon member that, since this is a new system, could we not allow a  Ministers
to respond on behalf of another Minister in  the  interest  of  the  members
getting a response to their statement?

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, on a point of order: No, we  cannot  allow  that,
Sir. Once you set that precedent then you might as well  go  and  scrap  the
Rules completely and simply have any Minister responding to  any  statement.
We specifically said, at the committee stage when we were looking  at  this,
that that is not what would happen.
The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  I  think  we  will  have  to  look  at  it,
Minister, in terms of the guidelines. This  is  something  new  and  we  are
feeling our way. We will have a look at the point being raised by the DP.

The MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM: Chairperson, it has  long
been reported to this House, and, in fact, this House  commended  Government
for working along the lines of the cluster system. Ministers work along  the
lines of the cluster system. [Applause.] The point about that is  that  none
of us work in individual silos in empires of our  own.  We  take  collective
responsibility and when it comes to those clusters which we belong  to,  any
of us are quite prepared to respond  on  issues  relating  to  them.  It  is
rather unfair, when you have Ministers responsible for a particular  cluster
in the House, that they are not being given an opportunity to  correct  some
of the ridiculous things that have been said by the other side.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As I have stated earlier, this is new  to  us
all. We will look at it. We thank both sides for drawing it to  the  Chair's
attention, and we will ask the Table to assist in guiding us  for  the  next
statements session that we have. For now,  we  will  not  proceed  with  the
response as based on the cluster system until we have clarity, and  we  will
take it up in the near future.

                   PUPIL REGISTRATION IN THE EASTERN CAPE

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Chairperson, in relation to the question  of  the
Eastern Cape, can I inform the House again as a  matter  of  fact:  Children
are supposed to register in September or October. The only way you can  plan
for January  is  in  fact  if  registration  takes  place  then.  Particular
problems in Gauteng and elsewhere  arise  because  there  are  thousands  of
people who move to Gauteng who are not able to register and that is why  the
Gauteng department is now taking preventative action. It  is  impossible  to
cater for children who register on the first day, second day  or  third  day
of school. I think we have to be understanding about this.

In relation to Port Elizabeth, the same  problems  have  arisen  there  too.
Children have not registered and it is the parents who have registered.  The
departments use radio and newspaper advertising to ensure that. I will  meet
the hon member outside behind the  Speaker's  chair  at  the  end  of  these
proceedings, get the details  about  the  matter  and  provide  further  and
detailed information as to exactly  what  has  happened.  As  we  know,  the
Government is intervening directly in the  Eastern  Cape  in  the  areas  of
health, education and social  development  to  prop  up  the  administrative
system and we are looking  very  carefully  at  what  is  happening  on  the
ground. I will seek the assistance of  the  hon  member  and  deal  with  it
between the two of us.

                             HIV/AIDS IN PRISONS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Chairperson, I  did  raise  my  hand.
There is always this other side of the House on the  left.  I  am  not  sure
where the Chairman was looking.

The question was posed by  the  New  NP  with  regard  to  the  question  of
HIV/Aids and deaths in prison. They  cited  the  report  of  the  inspecting
judge. I must say that because the inspecting  judge  is  appointed  by  the
President  at  the  recommendation  of  the  Minister,  there  has  been  no
contradiction. He  is  doing  a  splendid  job  within  the  prison  system.
However, when it comes to statistics it really differs from  one  survey  to
another, depending on who is doing the survey  and  the  reasons  for  that.
That is why we now depend mostly on doctors from the  Department  of  Health
to certify the reasons and causes of death.

There is no compulsory testing within the prison system. It is  against  the
Constitution, and people who want that to happen  should  motivate  for  the
amendment of the Constitution but not the  obliteration  of  the  rights  of
people. We do encourage  voluntary  testing  and  there  is  also  voluntary
counselling in prison. There is also treatment for  those  who  suffer  from
this disease. There is also care and  education.  All  these  things  happen
within the framework of a national health policy. We cannot go beyond that.

I should also mention that one other problem  which  hinders  the  effective
treatment of this kind of disease, and many other  ailments,  in  prison  is
the question of overcrowding.  We  heard  yesterday  that  the  Minister  of
Finance did allocate some money towards fighting  overcrowding  in  prisons.
As it is, we have almost 185 000 prisoners in South Africa, and  57  000  of
those are unsentenced. This  is  part  of  the  problem  and  it  should  be
directed where it belongs.

Whereas we have the official capacity in our prisons  of  about  110  000  -
although it has improved from  104  000  to  110  000  -  it  is  still  not
sufficient because the overcrowding is about 68%. This hinders the  kind  of
programmes that we would  like  to  have  in  prison,  including  the  fight
against HIV and Aids in prisons.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Before we proceed, we will refer  the  matter
raised by the DP to the monitoring  committee  on  members'  statements  for
them to look at the matter.

                TRIBUTE TO THE LATE ROBERT MANGALISO SOBUKWE

                             (Draft Resolution)

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Chairperson, I move  on  behalf
of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that today marks the 25th anniversary of the passing away of  a
         great African patriot, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe;


  (2) acknowledges the contribution by Mr Sobukwe towards the liberation of
         this country and the immense  sacrifice  by  him  and  his  family,
         through their tireless efforts, to uplift the forgotten  people  of
         this country; and


  (3) pays tribute to this great son of our people, and of Africa, who will
         always be remembered by all South Africans.

Mrs M A A NJOBE: Chairperson, today Parliament has set  aside  time  to  pay
tribute to a man the Chief Whip's motion describes as a ``great son  of  our
people,  and  of  Africa,  who  will  always  be  remembered  by  all  South
Africans.'' This, indeed, is a commendable contribution by a  body  such  as
the national Parliament, representing all the people of South Africa.

Though born of extremely poor parents on 5 December 1924 in the  small  town
of Graaff-Reinet, the late Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe defied  the  effects  of
such abject poverty on his development and proved  to  have  what  has  been
described as ``an impressive intellectual aptitude which enabled him to  win
a number of scholarships to study at the University of  Fort  Hare,  finally
obtaining an honours degree and a diploma in Education.

Like most African leaders of the liberation struggle  in  South  Africa  and
elsewhere in Africa, it was at Fort Hare that he was  initiated  into  South
African politics through the ANC Youth League, which  was  founded  by  such
prominent  political  leaders  as  the  former  President,  Comrade   Nelson
Mandela, and former president of the ANC, Oliver  Tambo.  Inspired  by  such
leadership, in his address to the graduation class of 1949 at Fort  Hare  he
urged the graduates to, and I quote: ``Carry with you  into  the  world  the
vision of a new Africa, an Africa reborn, an  Africa  rejuvenated,  a  young
Africa''.

This was his dream for Africa. Indeed, it was a worthwhile dream  to  strive
for. Thus, in striving to achieve this dream, Sobukwe's  political  activism
saw him become a chairman of the Victoria East branch of the ANC.

Like most African university graduates of his time, Sobukwe  was  left  with
no choice but to become a  teacher.  While  teaching  in  the  then  Eastern
Transvaal, he found himself  deeply  involved  in  politics.  As  an  active
member of the ANC Youth League at the time, he participated,  together  with
Comrades Nelson Mandela, Tambo and others, in the drafting and promotion  of
the programme of action: a  plan  that  was  adopted  by  the  ANC  National
Conference of 1949. It was a programme whose tactics were to  intensify  the
struggle against discriminatory laws of the apartheid government.

Among other activities, the 1949 programme of action advocated  the  use  of
civil disobedience, strikes, stayaways and  boycotts  in  open  defiance  of
discriminatory laws. The late Robert Sobukwe, with other Eastern Cape  youth
league members, participated in the Defiance Campaign of 1952. More  than  8
000 people were arrested as they volunteered to be arrested.  For  his  part
in this campaign, Sobukwe lost his teaching post. However, he went  back  to
teaching in 1953 as a junior lecturer in the  Bantu  Studies  Department  of
Wits University.

At this time, he was also the editor of  the  Africanist  journal,  then  an
official mouthpiece of the ANC. His dream as an Africanist  led  him  to  be
critical of the ANC leadership, which he believed were  allowing  themselves
to  be   influenced   by   what   he   called,   I   quote,   ``liberal-left
multiracialists''. Unfortunately,  he  and  his  colleagues  did  not  fully
understand the objective of the inclusive policies of the ANC.

So, while at Wits University, he became  associated  with  Potlako  Leballo,
whose influence on a small group of youth league members  led  them  to  see
themselves  as  ``the''  real  Africans.  The  Africanists,  as  this  group
labelled themselves, were opposed to the racial  inclusivity  of  the  ANC's
policies. They saw Africa as a continent for Africans only. Yet it is  these
policies that led to the adoption of the Freedom Charter, a programme  which
today is as relevant to South Africa as it was then. It is a programme  that
formed the basis for the democratic Government's programmes.

It was during this period, in the late 1950s and early 1960s,  a  period  of
political storms in South Africa,  that  the  ANC  lost  Mr  Sobukwe  as  he
unfortunately went astray to found the PAC on 6 April  1959.  This  was  not
surprising though, as it is one of the common experiences  in  life  that  a
seed well sown may fail to produce the fruit intended.

However, to Mr Sobukwe's credit, as he went astray, he picked up the  banner
of Pan-Africanism, well  articulated  and  stamped  in  1958  by  the  first
conference of independent African states held  in  Accra,  Ghana.  With  his
passion for Pan-Africanism, he promoted the idea in  South  Africa.  Perhaps
it could  be  said  that  the  conference  helped  to  nourish  further  the
philosophy of black consciousness, which was beginning  to  gain  ground  in
South Africa at that time.

Pan-Africanism in turn gave great impetus to the ANC in  leading  the  anti-
apartheid struggle. Cadres, nurtured in  the  Black  Consciousness  Movement
and  realising  the  appropriateness  of  the  ANC's  policies,  joined  the
frontline of ANC cadres as  the  anti-apartheid  struggle  climaxed  in  the
1970s and 1980s.

The ANC has always been consistent in its policies, developing them  as  the
need to accommodate the democratic  changes  taking  place  in  our  country
arises. This happens without the need to shift from the original  objectives
aimed at liberating our people from all forms  of  oppression  -  political,
social, cultural and economic.

Had Sobukwe lived longer to witness the birth of the  new  democratic  South
Africa under the leadership of the  organisation  that  initiated  him  into
politics, he would have witnessed the making of one of the most  progressive
constitutions in the  world  whose  Bill  of  Rights  not  only  spells  out
comprehensively the rights of all South African citizens, but  goes  further
to specifically guarantee, where relevant, the rights of women.

He would have witnessed how an ANC-led  Government,  basing  itself  on  the
Constitution  and  guided  by  the   Freedom   Charter,   a   programme   he
unfortunately rejected,  has  over  the  past  eight  years  endeavoured  to
implement programmes inclusive of the needs of  all  South  Africans,  while
bearing in mind the urgent need to address not only racial, but also  gender
imbalances confronting the South African nation.

He would have observed how women and children of all races, including  those
in his own family, have benefited and continue  to  benefit  from  the  wide
range of social services provided by the ANC-led  Government  for  the  most
vulnerable in society. He obviously would  have  noted  in  the  President's
state of the nation address on Friday, 14 February  2003,  and  in  the  hon
Minister of Finance's Budget Speech yesterday this  Government's  commitment
not only to improving the quality of delivery of social services,  but  also
to expanding their extent.  He  would  have  known  that  women,  being  the
majority in this country, are in fact the beneficiaries of these services.

Looking at legislation that has been passed by this  Parliament  to  promote
gender equality in our society, I am sure that he would  have  given  a  nod
for its implementation. I dare  say  that  he  would  have  appreciated  the
efforts being made to transform the economic situation in our country to  be
inclusive of the previously disadvantaged majority.

He certainly would have  noted  the  progress  made  so  far  through  black
economic empowerment programmes. I  would  have  then  drawn  his  attention
particularly to the  commitment  made  by  the  President  that  women-owned
businesses  would  receive  additional  support   through   the   SA   Women
Entrepreneurs' Network.

The benefits enjoyed by women today are in fact the fruit of their  struggle
for national liberation and women's emancipation. The 1956 march by  20  000
women to Pretoria to denounce pass laws is  but  one  example.  Yet  African
women in various countries also  played  an  important  role  in  the  armed
struggle waged against colonialism.

The birth of the Pan-African  Women's  Organisation,  Pawo  for  short,  was
inspired by the 1958 Pan-Africanist Congress and motivated by the  need  for
women to act together. Pawo's constitution  recognises  that  Pan-Africanism
constitutes  an  irreversible  path  for  the  survival  of  the  continent.
However, this constitution needs to be updated to  enable  women  to  be  an
integral part of the programmes of the African Union and Nepad.

In conclusion, I believe that the late Mr Sobukwe,  having  been  by  nature
the true selfless patriot  that  he  was,  poses  the  question  as  to  the
direction in which  he  would  have  been  leading  the  party  he  founded,
considering that he was  himself  a  true  Pan-Africanist.  Today  President
Thabo Mbeki is doing so much for and through the African Union, and  through
its programme Nepad, to promote the concept of the African Renaissance.
Perhaps, realising that his own dream was about to come true, he would  have
been more supportive and would  have  been  part  of  the  forces  that  are
treading the long walk to African unity. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  W  J  SEREMANE:  Chairperson,  please  allow  me  to  indulge  in   some
commercials. There are people who quietly go into this  life  observing  the
truth and when they write the truth or report the truth, report  it  without
fear or favour.  I  refer  here  to  A  Tribute  to  Integrity.  This  is  a
documentary in two parts by Kevin Harris on the life of Sobukwe,  and  there
is another one here, A Tribute to Reconciliation by Hennie Serfontein.

It is unconventional to raise controversy on the occasion of paying  tribute
to a person so richly deserving to be known as one  of  this  country's  and
continent's great sons of the soil.

History and ensuing events have  linked,  inextricably,  the  name  of  this
legend, Mangaliso, the wonderboy of politics of his time and  age,  to  that
of unsung - wittingly or unwittingly - heroes and heroines of our country.

South African society has the  unsavoury  tendency  of  downplaying  if  not
obscuring her  own  sons'  and  daughters'  contribution  on  the  basis  of
ideological or sectarian bias and  prejudice.  At  best  we  do  glibly  pay
homage as an afterthought. That makes me sad and angry.

In paying tribute to Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, I feel  duty-bound  to  pause
and invoke the names of Sobukwe's sister-in-law and  her  late  husband  and
family. I refer here to Dr and Mrs Ribeiro and their surviving  children  in
Mamelodi wa Tshwane, unsung and unthought  of.  Their  indomitable  freedom-
loving souls will march on, however, perhaps to come back one day  to  haunt
this ungrateful, fickle society of ours. Salute the  dead,  but  also  serve
the remaining living with passion and compassion!

Let us,  however,  pay  tribute  to  Robert  Mangaliso  Sobukwe  not  as  an
afterthought but because he deserves the honour and praise of men and  women
alike.

Professor, or Prof, as our generation affectionately called him,  was  first
a human being before being a politician or a political animal.  Sobukwe  had
profound human sensitivity, love and respect for all  fellow  human  beings,
young and old, rich or poor, white or black.

Mama Veronica, Didanisizwe, Dalindyebo  and  Milisiwa  know  the  ubuntu  or
humanness of Prof that most of us can never fully describe. This  man,  this
gifted yet gentle giant, was truly  an  icon  of  wisdom,  incisiveness  and
compassion. He truly loved his fellow beings and compatriots, even those  he
differed with politically.

Everybody felt at home and comfortable with  Mangaliso  Sobukwe.  This  man,
who would never receive anyone in his house  or  office  sitting  down,  had
impeccable manners and chivalry. You had to  force  him  to  remain  in  his
house or office when taking leave of him. He would  want  to  accompany  you
out and, in true African custom, walk you up to at least the door  or  gate.
This respect he accorded  everybody,  irrespective  of  their  political  or
social stations.

This man was godly too. I remember vividly certain salient things  he  stood
for and quietly  imparted  to  those  who  had  ears  to  listen,  such  as:
``Bludgeon your opponent with facts and not knuckle-dusters.'' In this  way,
he was depicting tolerance, maturity and the belief in debate and  dialogue.
I quote again from him: ``Your opponents are your  opponents  and  not  your
enemies, so if you must fight them,  fight  them  only  in  your  own  self-
defence and avoid being the aggressor,'' he would say.

If time permitted me, I would share with you how he came to give this  piece
of wisdom: ``Monty, if you want to change  them,  give  them  love  and  not
hatred,'' an almost difficult Christ-like dictum.

Every time Mama Veronica stayed over in a Montshiwa Township matchbox  house
on her way to Botswana to meet one of her exiled children, she  would  bring
greetings from Prof to Esther and family, including the  unborn  baby.  This
went on for months before this baby was actually born.  Finally,  the  child
was born and turned out to be a boy. What choice was there but to  name  the
boychild Sobukwe, topped off with Lembede? He wished  for  and  predicted  a
baby boy, the family believed. A small way  of  paying  tribute  to  one  so
great and noble and yet so humble was to name the boychild  after  Prof  and
Muziwakhe Lembede.

People of stature such as  Robert  Mangaliso  Sobukwe  are  indeed  valuable
gifts to the nation and humanity. We unconditionally salute and pay  tribute
to this great man, Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe. May his  memories  be  with  us
and  the  coming  generations.  Nothing  Stalinist  should  be  allowed   to
obliterate the memory of such great people, be  they  men,  women  or  youth
alike, irrespective of their colour, race, creed or political persuasions.

Listen if you have ears. In typical Sobukwe style, I close this salute  with
reference to his faith, because he was a member of the  Wesleyan  `Lidodana'
[young men's guild], from Matthew 5:23-24:


  So, if you are about to give a gift to God at the  altar  and  there  you
  remember that your brother or sister has  something  against  you,  leave
  your gift there in front of the altar, go out at once and make peace with
  your brother or sister. Then come back and offer your gift to God.

To paraphrase this, I would say, before you pay tribute  to  the  dead,  pay
tribute to the living. [Time expired.]

Mr N S MIDDLETON: Chairperson, let me start off by correcting what has  been
said here about Sobukwe, that he went astray in his life. The  Sobukwe  that
I knew never went astray.

Today we are paying homage to one of the  most  extraordinary  men  who  has
left a profound imprint on the  history  of  our  homeland,  Africa.  Robert
Mangaliso Sobukwe was a gifted leader with matchless courage, who  stood  by
his words even when he was subjected to  the  most  inhumane  treatment  any
person could ever imagine today.

Mangaliso was first and foremost an Africanist and, for that matter, a  true
African who believed in the liberation not only of  the  oppressed,  but  in
the liberation and the rebirth of Africa. As  he  stated  in  1949:  ``World
civilisation will never be complete until the  African  has  made  his  full
contribution.'' Though branded by his critics as a racist, he  never  looked
at people according to their race, as he believed that  there  is  only  one
race to which we all belong and he always  said  that  this  was  the  human
race.

It was because of these  principles  that  I  requested  him  personally  to
defend me in one of my trials for treason in 1977-79. It was this  very  man
who then assisted great people such  as  Mr  Mailer  and  the  late  Justice
Mohammed in my long trial. I came to know this man as a leader, and  a  born
leader.

During his long, drawn-out trial, he  always  said  to  me:  ``Norman,  fear
not'', because he believed in justice. Robert was a  fearless  man  and  yet
what he did not fear was his oppressors who  even  went  to  the  extent  of
keeping him in jail. After the expiration of  his  sentence  in  1963,  they
even made a special law for him which was called the Sobukwe Clause.

It was due to his living spirit that even the  workers,  in  remembrance  of
him, formed Cusa, the Council of Unions of South Africa. It  was  partly  in
remembrance of this man that the organisation which later became Nactu,  the
National Council of Trade Unions, was formed. Workers knew who  he  was  and
they wanted to pay tribute to him.

We will never  forget  his  contribution  to  the  struggle,  which  was  an
inspiration for the present and the future generations. Africa,  I  believe,
will  never  be  free  nor  will  it  ever  be  fully  liberated  until  you
acknowledge the works and the struggle of Sobukwe.
Lala kahle ngokuthula, qhawe lase-Afrika. Umoya wakhe  uyophila  nathi  kuze
kube phakade. Hamba kahle nkosi yakithi. [Ihlombe.][Rest in peace,  hero  of
Africa.  His  spirit  will  live  with  us  forever.  Go  well,  our   King.
[Applause.]]

Mr J DURAND: Mr Chairperson, our President, Mr Thabo Mbeki,  requested  this
debate.  In  an  election  year,  we  acted  impartially  by   creating   an
opportunity to honour Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, the leader of the  PAC  who,
at times, was one of the fiercest critics of the ANC. By this  gesture,  our
President is saying to us: Let us honour our country's heroes,  irrespective
of which political groupings they belong to. We should rather  look  at  the
contribution they made to South Africans who first fought  against  colonial
oppression and later against minority rule.

As we honour the late Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe, we should also  be  reminded
of all South Africans and great African heroes.  These  heroes,  both  black
and white, fought against oppression and minority rule.  Unfortunately,  our
pain and our suffering makes some  leaders  focus  on  themselves  or  their
racial groups, rather than  on  all  South  Africans.  What  could  we  have
achieved if, after the Anglo-Boer War, when  South  Africans  of  all  races
fought and died in the struggle against British oppression,  we  had  joined
hands in 1910, and created a democratic and free South Africa?

Today, as South Africans and Africans, we honour one of our leaders,  and  I
am reminded of the words of an Afrikaans author:


  As jou vryheid oor die velde lag,
  Weet aan wie jy dit te danke het.

A loose translation of this is: When your freedom smiles  over  the  plains,
remember who made it possible.

Today we honour a son of Africa, a South African leader who fought  for  the
liberation of the people of this land.

Who was Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe? Peter Lawrence of The Star said of him:


  There is a gentleness about him, not the gentleness of the meek, but that
  of a man who knows he does not have  to  shout.  Within  and  beyond  are
  passionate conviction, and he had an iron will.
[Interjections.] Before Dr  Pheko  shouts  again,  while  warming  up  stale
speeches, I think he should think about who Mr Robert Sobukwe was.

When Mangaliso was allowed to visit a sick  child  in  1973,  some  liberals
contrived an accidental meeting along the street  with  the  then  Paramount
Chief Buthelezi of KwaZulu. It is alleged  that  Paramount  Chief  Buthelezi
then spread rumours that Sobukwe approved  of  his  collaborative  activity.
Sobukwe then had the opportunity to clear  the  matter  up.  He  told  Matts
Homberg of a Swedish daily newspaper that:


  It is quite difficult to  convince  some  Africans  of  the  futility  of
  seeking short-term concessions or to stop  looking  for  short-term  help
  from radicals, so-called well-meaning liberals.

Sobukwe particularly repudiated  black  politicians  who  aimed  at  partial
concessions, often in co-operation with liberals. The  DA-IFP  coalition  in
KwaZulu-Natal is such an example. Lucas Mangope discovered this  fact  after
many blacks and some whites  were  killed  in  Bophuthatswana.  I  hope  the
leader of the IFP will take note.
In his address on behalf of the graduating class at Fort Hare, he said:


  Fort Hare must be to the African what Stellenbosch is to  the  Afrikaner.
  It must be the barometer of African thought.

I believe that both Fort Hare and Stellenbosch must  become  the  barometers
of South African and African  thought.  These  institutions  must  not  only
advance African and Afrikaner thinking, but also world thinking.

I want to address you as members  of  Parliament  in  the  words  of  Robert
Mangaliso Sobukwe:


  Sons and daughters of Africa, harbingers of the new world ...

... let us, in memory of one of our great  leaders,  create  a  new  African
order - a renaissance of good governance, democratic practices,  growth  and
prosperity for all our people. [Applause.]

Mr W G MAKANDA: Chairperson, hon members, in  1949  at  Fort  Hare,  Sobukwe
said, and I quote:


  We want to build a new Africa, and only we can build it ... Let me  plead
  with you, lovers of my Africa, to carry  with  you  into  the  world  the
  vision of a new Africa, an  Africa  reborn,  an  Africa  rejuvenated,  an
  Africa recreated, young Africa. We are the first glimmers of a new  dawn.
  And if we are persecuted for  our  views,  we  should  remember,  as  the
  African saying goes, that it is darkest before dawn ...

The name Sobukwe conjures up proud memories  of  the  selfless  service  and
courage of the  sons  and  daughters  of  South  Africa  of  all  races  who
dedicated their lives to the cause of liberating  our  country  from  racist
domination and social and moral injustice. He stands as a  colossus  amongst
our great men and women who adorn the annals of the heroic struggle  of  the
people of South Africa who fought for freedom,  self-determination  and  the
restoration of their dignity and their birthright.

We remember Sobukwe as a Pan-Africanist who played  no  small  part  in  the
pursuit of the cause of Pan-Africanism as a continental uniting  force.  His
contribution to this cause was curtailed by his incarceration  in  1960  and
his premature death after his release later. He walked in the  footsteps  of
other great Pan-Africanists in the ANC Youth League of the 1940s. These  are
Anton Lembede, Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo, and  others  who
had begun to mould and articulate a militant, nationalist and  revolutionary
message in the fight against apartheid which, hitherto, had  been  reformist
in character under the leadership of the old guard.

Anton Lembede  was  a  legend  and  icon  of  the  breakaway  Pan-Africanist
Congress of South Africa in 1959 when it was launched under  the  leadership
of Robert Sobukwe. It is important to note that Pan-Africanism  was  not  an
external influence imposed on South Africans and Africa in  general  by  the
great  thinkers  -  Marcus  Garvey,  DuBois,  Nkrumah   and   others.   They
articulated  a  force  which  had  taken  root  on  the  African  continent,
expressing resolve by the people of the continent to shake off the  yoke  of
colonialism and racial  domination.  The  gestation  of  the  Pan-Africanist
forces is discernable in  the  colonial  wars  of  dispossession  where  the
African ethnic kingdoms faced the colonisers on the battlefield  in  a  very
unequal contest in which they were subdued.

The formation of ``iMbumba yaManyama'' [Unity] in the  Eastern  Cape  was  a
coalition which cut across ethnic and class barriers, and  began  to  cement
and amalgamate a broader front against colonialism  in  recognition  of  the
common disabilities engendered by colonial  domination.  The  Pan-Africanism
that Sobukwe embraced originates  from  this  historical  milieu.  It  is  a
philosophy and a way of life that he willingly  adopted,  and  he  dedicated
his life to the realisation of his objectives. He led  by  example  and  led
from the front. He lived the motto of the PAC in that  he  served,  suffered
and sacrificed.

The pass campaign he led in 1960 represents a  historical  landmark  in  the
struggle  against  apartheid.  The  hitherto   unprecedented   massacre   at
Sharpeville and at Langa and the awe-inspiring  march  of  60  000  Africans
from Langa Township to Parliament ushered in what some pundits described  as
a historical watershed.

The pass laws were temporarily suspended and some scribes perceived in  this
conflict a people who were no longer willing to be ruled  in  the  old  way.
Likewise, the ruling clique could no longer continue  to  rule  in  the  old
way. In other words, they would have to submit to change or take  repression
to unprecedented levels. Sadly, they chose the latter option.  The  PAC  and
the ANC were banned. Draconian security laws  were  passed  and  implemented
with vigour. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Adv  Z  L  MADASA:  Mhlalingaphambili,  kudala  labethwa   ngoyaba   igalelo
lamaqhawe kaPoqo yile Ndlu. Bekufanele ukuba sithethe  sophele  ngeli  gorha
lakwaSobukwe. Iinto zooSobukwe zatsho kwantlandlolo ukuba idabi  lenkululeko
malingohlula-hlulwa, ibe ngumcimbi wocalu-calulo ngapha,  imicimbi  yomhlaba
nobutyebi belizwe ngapha. Namhlanje loo nyaniso icace gca okwekat'  emhlophe
ehlungwini.

Iinginginya  zabantu  abantsundu  zisatyiwa  yindlala.   Umhlaba   nobutyebi
busesezandleni zezizwe nangona ucalu-calulo seluphelile.  Idabi  lama-Afrika
alikapheli engekabulawuli ngokwawo ubutyebi belizwe loobaw' omkhulu.

Namhlanje sithetha nge-African Union, iManyano yama-Afrika, ukwenzela  ukuba
iAfrika  ithabathele  kuyo  ulawulo  nekamva  layo,  ingaxhomekeki   kumazwe
aseNtshona. Zonke ezi nquleqhu zenziwa ziinkokeli zethu, kodwa  azintshanga.
OoSobukwe bathetha ngezi zinto kwakudala. Kwamhla  mnene  iinkokeli  ezifana
noSobukwe zazikhala  ngobumbano  lwama-Afrika.  Kambe  bangakhala  namhlanje
ooSobukwe  xa  besiva  ngokwanda  kooHlohlesakhe  namasela  arhwaphiliza  lo
mnconwana ukhoyo wobutyebi ongafikeleliyo ebantwini.

Ukuze simkhumbule kakuhle uSobukwe namanye  amaqhawe  afana  naye,  singama-
Afrika,  kufuneka  sigutyule  aba  Hlohlesakhe  namasela  aphakathi  kwethu,
siwakhuphele ecaleni. Ukuze  livakale  kwaye  liqhube  igalelo  likaSobukwe,
masomeleze imbumba yeAfrika ze umhlaba nobutyebi bubuyele kubaniniwo.

Okokugqibela,   simkhumbula   lo   kaSobukwe   njengomxolelanisi    phakathi
kweentlanga  ngeentlanga,   nangona   wayetyholwa   ngokuba   nocalu-calulo.
NjengomKrestu wayebathanda abantu ngaphandle komkhethe.

Mandilungise kwesa sityholo sokuba waphuma ecaleni.  USobukwe  zange  aphume
ecaleni ngokweyam imbono, ntonje waphuma kwi-ANC. Asikokuphuma ecaleni  oko.
[Uwele-wele.] Wohlukana ne-ANC  ngokuba  nezimvo  ezizezakhe.  Yintoni  embi
kuloo nto? [Uwele-wele.] Loo  nto  imbi  kuphela  kumntu  ongafuni  kulawula
umntu nje kuphela, koko alawule neengcamango zakhe.

Imibutho  yezopolitiko  yahluka-hlukene.  Ewe,  ikhona   imibutho   ekuthiwa
iyathengisa, njalo njalo.  Mayithengise  ethengisayo,  kodwa  oko  akuthethi
ukuba yonke imibutho iyathengisa.

Okokugqibela,   mandivale   ngokuthi:   Mayibuye   iAfrika,   izwe    lethu.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[ADV Z L MADASA: Chairperson, this House has  yet  to  honour  the  role  of
heroes and heroines of Pan-Africanism. We  should  be  talking  as  much  as
possible about this hero who is a descendant of  the  Sobukwes.  Mr  Sobukwe
and his compatriots in their struggle years,  said  that  the  struggle  for
liberation must not be divided and become an issue  of  racism  on  the  one
hand and of distribution of wealth and land on  the  other.  Today,  we  can
proudly concur with that assertion.

Many black people are still hungry. Land and wealth are still in  the  hands
of foreign countries even though there is no more  apartheid.  The  struggle
of African people cannot end whilst the wealth of the land is not  in  their
hands. Today we speak about the African Union, and that is  so  that  Africa
could take control and pave the way to the future, and not be  dependent  on
countries of the West. All these efforts made by our leaders today  are  not
new. Mr Sobukwe and those he struggled with  talked  about  these  things  a
long time ago. Long ago leaders like  Mr  Sobukwe  were  calling  for  unity
amongst Africans. Today they would shed  tears  of  disappointment  if  they
could see the fat cats and corrupt officials whose intention is  to  defraud
people of the little they have, most of which is not accessible to people.

In order for us to remember and honour Mr  Sobukwe  and  other  heroes  like
him, as Africans, we should get rid of  these  fatcats  and  corrupt  people
among us. In order for Sobukwe's role to be  effective,  we  should  support
the African Union so that the land and wealth can be  redistributed  amongst
its rightful owners.

Lastly, we remember Mr Sobukwe as  a  peacemaker  between  different  races,
even though it was alleged that he was racist. As a Christian he  could  not
discriminate against people.

I should perhaps correct the wrong view that  he  was  a  dissenter.  In  my
view, Mr Sobukwe was not a dissenter, he just resigned as a  member  of  the
ANC. [Interjections.] He became separated from the ANC because  he  had  his
own views. Is that a bad thing? [Interjections.] Indeed, that is  bad  to  a
person who not only wants to control another person, but his  or  her  views
as well. Political organisations have different  ideologies.  Indeed,  there
are organisations that are known as sell-outs, and so  on.  Those  that  are
selling  out  must  continue  to  do  so,  but  that  does  not   mean   all
organisations are selling out.

Lastly, I would like to conclude by  saying:  Africa  must  come  back!  Our
Land! [Applause.]]

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Mr Chairperson, the hon Durand  should  hang  his  head  in
shame for using this occasion to promote the cause of the spineless New  NP,
which can hardly fill candidacies in what used to be their own  strongholds.


In support of the motion, one notes that Pontius Pilate was spot-on when  he
said in John, chapter 19, verse 5: ``Behold the  man!''  Here  is  the  man.
Mangaliso Sobukwe, as many have stated, was a  man  of  wonders.  He  spewed
fire from his university days. In 1949, at the Completers' Social  function,
he said: ``Do not ask me to use moderation in a cause  like  the  present'',
when he referred to the poor conditions of Africans at the time.  Being  who
he was, he showed his mettle in 1959 when he  stood  up  and  spoke  out  to
break ranks with the ANC to form the Pan-Africanist Congress. He  felt  that
the ANC was pandering to the whims  of  the  liberals  by  clinging  to  the
Freedom Charter at the expense of Africanism.

As a leader, Sobukwe led from the front. He would not allow young people  to
be mowed down whilst the leaders hid. Instead,  he  handed  himself  to  the
police undisguised. He said: ``We are not prepared to have our  people  used
as cannon fodder. When we embark on a campaign, it will be the  leaders  who
will be in front. They will not remain behind or run away while  the  masses
rot in jail.''

Sobukwe yearned for what he called the United States of Africa, which  would
span the area from Cape to Cairo and from Morocco to Madagascar.  He  had  a
``vision of a new Africa ... an  Africa  rejuvenated,  an  Africa  recreated
...''. The African unity, as we see it these days, can readily be  described
as the brainchild of this great giant.

He suffered no illusions whatsoever  about  the  path  he  followed  in  his
challenge  to  the  white  regime  at  the  time.  In  his   dignified   and
authoritative manner, he caused the then Minister of Justice, B  J  Vorster,
sleepless nights. Vorster said of Sobukwe: ``He is a  man  with  a  magnetic
personality, great organising ability  and  a  divine  sense  of  mission''.
Because of that,  Vorster  vowed  to  detain  Sobukwe  until  this  side  of
eternity. Sobukwe was a real handful to the South African  government.  When
mention was made of his name, they had butterflies in their stomachs.

His organisational ability was  noted  on  21  March  1960  in  Sharpeville,
within one year of the formation of the PAC.  The  organisation  was  a  hot
potato to the government of the day, hence its banning, as well as  that  of
the ANC. Though demonised by the authorities, those who knew  him  knew  him
as a modest man who was sensitive and concerned about the  needs  and  hurts
of others. They knew him as incapable of meanness. He wore the trademark  of
a warm smile and a big grin, followed by a deep chuckle of amusement. It  is
a pity that, even these days, there are those who revel in silencing  people
when they speak about this worthy son of Africa who died unsung, unsaid  and
unwept.

Those who care, know he left South Africans a legacy when he  said:  ``There
is only one race to which we all belong and that is  the  human  race''.  We
call on the  powers  that  be  to  immortalise  Mangaliso  Sobukwe  so  that
posterity can come to know that he was who he was - a man  with  a  mind  of
his own, a man of great integrity and a  patriot  par  excellence.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, we feel privileged to be given  the  opportunity
to pause, remember and give thanks to God for the  life  of  and  witness  a
great leader of this nation, Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe.  We  thank  President
Mbeki and Minister Kader Asmal for this timely reminder. Our only regret  is
that perhaps we should have had a whole day to discuss this tribute.

A son of the soil, a son of the Karoo, he rose  to  great  heights  in  this
nation and in the international community of nations.  Coming  from  a  very
religious family, he was fully grounded in Methodism by  his  father  Hubert
and mother Angeline. He studied at the prestigious Healdtown College and  at
Fort Hare. Here he became chairman of the SRC. He was  fully  proficient  in
Xhosa, Sotho, Afrikaans and English. He was a  good  teacher,  a  university
tutor at Wits and a powerful preacher in the Methodist church in  Galeshewe,
Kimberley, to where he was banished. The local church there  will  show  you
his seat in the church with great love, joy and pride. He  married  Veronica
Zodwa Mathe and their marriage was blessed with four children - a  daughter,
Miliswa, and three sons, Dalindyebo,  Didanisizwe  and  Dinilesizwe.  I  had
thought that Dini would be in the House today. I think he is in the city  to
hear what we have to say about his father.

At Fort Hare, Mangaliso  became  a  member  of  the  ANC  Youth  League,  an
Africanist within the ANC, and in 1959 he led  the  group  that  broke  away
from the ANC to form the Pan-Africanist Congress  of  Azania.  On  21  March
1960, the PAC organised an anti-pass law campaign which tragically  resulted
in the ruthless massacre of 68 people, injuring 186 men, women and  children
in Sharpeville. This event rocked the  world.  The  ANC  and  the  PAC  were
declared unlawful organisations. The United Nations  declared  21  March  as
Sharpeville Day. The armed struggle was born. APLA and MK took up the  armed
struggle. Sobukwe and PAC leaders were arrested, sentenced to  three  years,
two years and 18 months respectively.

The Parliament of our land, this  House,  did  the  extraordinary  thing  of
passing the Sobukwe Clause, every year for six years, to keep him on  Robben
Island. This was a cruel and inhuman thing, as he had  no  reasonable  human
companionship there. His crime was outlined by the Minister of  Justice,  Mr
B J Vorster. He described Sobukwe as ``a person who has a  strong,  magnetic
personality, a person who can organise, a person who feels  that  he  has  a
vocation to perform this task, well-knowing what methods can  be  applied''.
That was enough guilt, enough offence for him to be kept on Robben Island.

Sobukwe was  a  political  thinker  of  great  standing,  one  of  the  best
political philosophers that Africa has produced.  His  ideas  are  timeless,
particularly his exposition of African unity, of nonracialism,  of  positive
nonalignment and of Pan-Africanism. Listen  to  what  he  said  as  a  young
student at Fort Hare:


  We wish to make it clear again that we  are  anti  nobody.  We  are  pro-
  Africa. We breathe, we dream, we  live  in  Africa,  because  Africa  and
  humanity are  inseparable.  It  is  only  by  doing  the  same  that  the
  minorities of this land, the Europeans, Coloureds and Indians, can secure
  mental and spiritual freedom. On the liberation  of  Africa  depends  the
  liberation of the whole world.

He died on 27 February 1978 of lung cancer and was buried at his  birthplace
and home in Graaff-Reinet on 11 March 1978. Mr  Anthony  Lewis  of  the  New
York Times met Sobukwe on 9 June 1975 in Kimberley and wrote of him:


  There was a power in him that shone through all the  petty  cruelties  of
  official suppression. It is a power of belief in humanity, in  nonviolent
  challenge towards justice, a man utterly at peace with himself  and  with
  his tormentors. He laughed a lot and said: ``A nonracial society  -  that
  remains my goal. I will make racism a crime, no matter from which side it
  came, like the American Civil Rights law.''

This is a quote from Benjamin Pogrund, to whom I would like to  pay  tribute
for having written a book on Sobukwe. We  honour  our  founder-president  on
this 25th anniversary of his death. His difficult  and  tragic  life  was  a
long tale of the three S's - serve, suffer and sacrifice.  His  memory  will
shine eternally in the hearts of many simple compatriots for whom he  spoke,
toiled, suffered and died.

My very last word is an appeal that it would be a very  significant  way  of
honouring his memory if, indeed, the PAC and ANC  could  come  together  and
talk about this matter. I realise, from some  of  the  things  said  by  hon
members, that there is a lack of forgiveness of historic  facts.  I  believe
that this must be buried once and for all in order for this country to  move
on. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, I start this tribute with  a  quote  from  the
late Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe's speech at the `Completers' Social'  at  Fort
Hare in 1949:


  We want to build a new Africa, and only we can build it ... Let me  plead
  with you, lovers of Africa, to carry with you into the world  the  vision
  of a new Africa, an Africa  reborn,  an  Africa  rejuvenated,  an  Africa
  recreated, young Africa. We are the first glimmers of a new dawn. And  if
  we are persecuted for our views,  we  should  remember,  as  the  African
  saying goes, that it is darkest before dawn, and  that  the  dying  beast
  kicks most violently when it is giving up the ghost, so to speak.


  The fellows who clamped Nehru into jail are today his servants ... As Zik
  puts it: ``Tell a man whose house is on fire to give  a  moderate  alarm;
  tell a man moderately to rescue his wife from the  arms  of  a  ravisher;
  tell a mother to extricate gradually her babe from the fire into which it
  has fallen, but do not ask me to use  moderation  in  a  cause  like  the
  present.''


  Africa will be free. The wheel of progress revolves relentlessly and  all
  the nations of the world take their  turn  at  the  fieldglass  of  human
  destiny. Africa will not retreat! Africa will not compromise! Africa will
  not relent! Africa will not equivocate! And she will be  heard!  Remember
  Africa!

Sobukwe, you are the father of the PAC. Your dedication  and  commitment  to
overcome the struggle burns  intently  in  your  words.  You  have  been  an
inspiration and a great leader to many. Today you would  be  proud  to  know
that your commitment and fight have been answered. We are a free people.  We
are a government by the people, for the people. But we are  one  nation,  no
matter what colour or creed. We have succeeded.

Yes, you are a role model to our young and old in society. To our  youth  of
Africa: Remember, there is no age at which to make  a  difference.  You  can
make it. You can ensure that you can build your future  and  the  future  of
our country, our beautiful South Africa.

Mr Mangaliso Robert Sobukwe, I am sure you are resting  in  peace  now  that
South Africa is free at last. Phumula ngokuthula. [Rest in peace.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Preamble to  our  Constitution  we
declare that -


  We, the people of South Africa ... Honour those who suffered for  justice
  and freedom in our land.

There can surely be no doubt that the late  Robert  Mangaliso  Sobukwe  fits
this description. Like the great Dr Anton Rupert, he was  born  in  1924  in
Graaff-Reinet in the Karoo, the same  town  in  which  another  great  South
African, Dr D F Malan,  served  as  minister  of  religion  before  entering
politics.

As a student, lay preacher and teacher  of  the  40s  and  50s,  he  was  an
outspoken opponent of apartheid. He was instrumental  in  the  formation  of
the PAC that broke away from  the  ANC  in  1959.  After  his  role  in  the
antipass campaign and the revolt at Sharpeville in  1960,  he  was  arrested
and, after an initial three-year sentence, detained  by  a  special  Act  of
Parliament in terms of the so-called Sobukwe Clause, and  effectively  spent
the rest of his life in prison until his death in 1978 at the age of 54.

In evaluating the political philosophy of Sobukwe, it must be  said  to  his
credit  that  he  rejected  communism.  He  also  devoted  himself  to   the
achievement of human rights and freedom for all. He was  one  of  the  first
prophets of an African renaissance with his well-known vision of -


  ... a new Africa, an Africa reborn,  an  Africa  rejuvenated,  an  Africa
  recreated, young Africa. We are the first glimmers of a new dawn.

On the other hand, it must be stated that his political  model  would  never
be the  solution  for  a  country  such  as  South  Africa.  Pan-Africanism,
socialism and his total refusal of power-sharing can be mentioned  here.  He
had no real recognition of the diversity of South Africa, as illustrated  by
his statement at the Africanist Inaugural Convention in 1959:


  We  guarantee  no  minority  rights,  because  we  think  in   terms   of
  individuals, not groups.

On his personality and charismatic qualities,  I  only  quote  former  prime
minister John Vorster, who, in providing a reason for his detention, said:


  He is a man with a magnetic personality, great organising ability  and  a
  divine sense of mission.

But, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Preamble  to  our  Constitution  we  don't
only declare that  we  will  honour  those  who  suffered  for  justice  and
freedom, we also declare that we will 11respect those  who  have  worked  to
build and develop our country''.

In dié verband moet ek vandag die vraag vra: kom hierdie onderneming tot  sy
reg in ons openbare projekte, in ons skoolleerplanne  en  in  hierdie  Huis?
Ons het al in hierdie Huis baie huldigingsdebatte gehad vir  talle  van  die
helde uit die struggle. Gaan ons steeds net een  deel  van  ons  geskiedenis
herdenk? Gaan my voorgangers, wat ook hul alles vir hierdie land gegee  het,
ook eendag aan die beurt kom? Sit ons met 'n  situasie  van  die  oorwinnaar
wat die geskiedenis herskryf in ons debatte, in ons leerplanne? Sit ons  met
'n oorvereenvoudigde geskiedenis van ``good guys'' en ``bad guys''?

Eers wanneer ons ook  erns  maak  met  hierdie  tweede  onderneming  in  die
Grondwet, kan ons daarop aanspraak maak dat Suid-Afrika regtig  'n  plek  is
vir al sy mense. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[In this regard I have to ask a question today: Is  justice  being  done  to
this undertaking in our public projects, in  our  school  curricula  and  in
this House? We have already had a number of tributary debates in this  House
for  many  of  the  heroes  of  the  struggle.  Are  we  going  to  continue
commemorating just a part of our history? Will  my  predecessors,  who  gave
their best for this country as well, also have their turn  one  day?  Do  we
have a situation here of the victor rewriting history  in  our  debates,  in
our curricula? Do we have an oversimplified history of  good  guys  and  bad
guys?

Only when we take this second undertaking  in  the  Constitution  seriously,
can we claim that South Africa truly is a place for all its people. I  thank
you.]

Mr P J  NEFOLOVHODWE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  words  have  no  meaning  by
themselves. They acquire meaning  from  given  material  circumstances  that
govern the activities of people at any given moment in  time.  So,  when  we
honour Sobukwe, we should not make the mistake of thinking that  if  he  was
living now, he would have answered all the difficult questions that  we  are
grappling with now.

We should also not criticise him for not answering that which he never  saw.
So, when we remember Sobukwe, we should remember him for what he did  within
the circumstances in which he found himself with others in  those  days.  At
the same time, we should rededicate ourselves  to  those  issues  he  raised
that are still relevant today.

When we speak of Sobukwe, we are speaking of a  teacher,  a  philosopher,  a
visionary, an activist and a dynamic leader. To speak of this  fearless  son
of Africa is to speak  of  one  of  the  most  hated  persons  by  the  then
apartheid regime. You will  remember  that  when  he  was  taken  to  Robben
Island, they actually separated him from all other prisoners, and he  stayed
by himself, even though his activities had been  similar  to  those  of  the
people who were with him on Robben Island.

Despite his political views, with which some of us may  not  agree  now,  he
was indeed a selfless leader and he was indeed a champion of the  liberation
struggle, not only in South Africa, but in Africa and in the  world.  So  we
honour him, all of us, silently, not because he is one  of  the  forefathers
of Africa. In the African tradition, when we honour people such as  him,  we
don't make a noise, even if we didn't agree with what they had said.

When we speak and write about the struggle of the African continent and  the
people of Africa, and elsewhere in the world, Comrade Sobukwe's  name  ranks
high. When we think about the pioneers of ideas about ourselves, our  image,
identity and dignity as  Africans,  we  then  immediately  remember  Comrade
Sobukwe's concept of the African personality.

The relationship between Comrade Sobukwe and the  people  of  South  Africa,
and black people in particular, can only be gleaned from his  writing.  When
reading his speeches we came to the conclusion that if  he  had  been  alive
today Pan-Africanism, a philosophy he articulated so well, would  have  been
highly regarded on the African continent and agenda.  Indeed  South  Africa,
Africa and the entire world lost a leader, a  revolutionary  and  a  man  of
great stature.

Broadly speaking, Comrade Sobukwe understood that power is not  neutral.  He
understood very well that power  is  not  neutral.  He  knew  that  opposing
forces exist in society and that in every society one is either part of  the
problem or part of the solution, as Comrade Bantu Biko would  have  put  it.
Comrade Sobukwe not only chose to be part of the solution, but went  further
to lead a process of  resolving  the  problem  and  for  this  he  paid  the
ultimate price.

His belief in Africans, his determination to  free  black  people  in  South
Africa, his commitment to the unification  of  the  African  continent  -  a
vision we are now pursuing - will always remind us  of  the  great  struggle
ahead. He was indeed a son of the soil. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr A MLANGENI: Madam Speaker, today we are gathered here to pay  tribute  to
one of the heroes of our  struggle  for  freedom  in  South  Africa,  Robert
Mangaliso Sobukwe, who died 25 years ago. In his book called  Long  Walk  to
Freedom, Madiba describes  him  as  ``a  dazzling  orator  and  an  incisive
thinker.''

The  Pan-Africanist  Congress  launched  itself  on  6  April  1959,  as  an
Africanist organisation that expressly rejected the  multiracialism  of  the
ANC. In his opening address, after he was elected  the  first  President  of
the PAC, Sobukwe ``called for a government of the Africans by  the  Africans
and for the Africans.''

The definition of "African" as understood by the PAC,  then,  was  obviously
very narrow because it excluded all other population groups in the  country.
However, I believe that has now changed because today we have the De  Lilles
and the Patrick Duncans in their organisation. [Laughter.]

As the Secretary of the  then  South  Western  Townships,  the  present  day
Soweto, I had the privilege of working with Sobukwe because his  ANC  branch
then fell under my jurisdiction - this was before they broke away  from  the
ANC in 1958.

Sobukwe was a humble man, a giant of  an  intellectual  who  could  take  on
anybody on any political topic. He was a lecturer at Wits University  as  we
all know, but, because he was black like me, he could not be given a  chair,
even though he was qualified. His colleagues, however, referred  to  him  as
Prof - because he was qualified for that position. One day we  will  discuss
the reasons why the PAC left the ANC.

Sobukwe was an adherent of the philosophy of Marcus  Garvey.  Garvey  was  a
good organiser. He believed that the dissatisfaction of black Americans  was
so deep that there was no hope of ever  gaining  a  full  life  in  America.
Therefore, he believed, a country must be found in Africa  where  the  black
Americans could determine their own future and be part of  a  United  States
of Africa.

Even when he was still a member of the ANC, Sobukwe expressed views  similar
to those of Garvey, namely of an  Africa  for  the  Africans  and  a  United
States of Africa.

The weakness of this philosophy is that it was not  inclusive.  It  excluded
other population groups such as Indians, coloureds and  whites  as  part  of
the struggle against apartheid. Sobukwe believed that  Africans  alone  must
fight for their freedom. According to him, whites and  Indians  were  aliens
and therefore could not be included in the fight against white domination.

Even on Robben Island, these views were strongly  expressed  by  members  of
the PAC. Be  that  as  it  may,  Sobukwe  was  a  great  leader,  a  man  of
extraordinary courage. He was a fearless man; a man with a  vision.  We  did
not agree with the views  of  Sobukwe  nor  with  the  policy  of  the  PAC.
Nevertheless, we respected Sobukwe as a human being.

That the PAC under the  leadership  of  Sobukwe  would  have  achieved  that
liberation by the end of 1963 is the wildest dream I  have  ever  heard  of.
However, Sobukwe made his contribution. As we know - we  have  all  referred
to it - he was arrested, taken away from his wife,  children  and  relatives
and imprisoned for many years and after he had finished his three  years  of
imprisonment, we all know that the Sobukwe Clause was  passed  in  order  to
keep him in prison even though he had finished his sentence.

The PAC found an already prepared ground - by the way - prepared by the  ANC
which had been campaigning for  the  destruction  of  the  passes.  We  were
supposed to have destroyed these passes  on  31  March.  The  ANC  had  been
campaigning for that. But unfortunately, the PAC hijacked that  and  brought
the date forward. [Laughter.] I am not attacking  the  PAC  -  I  am  merely
stating facts, comrades - they hijacked our campaign and, a week before  the
date of our campaign, they marched on to Sharpeville; and we of course  know
what happened thereafter.

Sharpeville Day is now observed throughout the world as a day of  solidarity
with the struggle of our people, and has been named  International  Day  for
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in the world. Sobukwe's  commitment
to  Pan-Africanism,  even  after  all  the  years  of  isolation,  has  been
acknowledged by many.

I was going to refer to his address at the graduation in 1949 at  Fort  Hare
but almost all the speakers have referred to it. I  do  want  to  say  that,
among other things, he said that if we  are  persecuted  for  our  views  we
should remember - I think  Comrade  Rajbally  also  referred  to  it  -  the
African saying that:


  It is always darkest before dawn, and that the  dying  beast  kicks  most
  violently when it is giving up the ghost, so to speak.

He  said,  ''The  fellows  who  clamped  Nehru  into  jail  are  today   his
servants.''

Sobukwe loved Africa and he loved its people. In 1960, he  voluntarily  went
to prison. He went to Orlando Police Station and said to the police, ''I  am
not prepared to carry a dompas any  more.  You  may  arrest  me  if  you  so
wish'', and they arrested him.

Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Motion agreed to.

        LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL STRUCTURES SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER  FOR  PROVINCIAL  AND  LOCAL  GOVERNMENT:  Madam  Deputy
Speaker, hon members, just over  two  years  ago,  we  inaugurated  our  new
system of local government. This represented a watershed in  our  continuing
endeavour to build a truly  developmental  state.  Needless  to  say,  local
government occupies a  strategic  position  in  the  broader  front  against
poverty and underdevelopment. It  continues  to  play  a  critical  role  in
building  local  economies,  developing  social  infrastructure,  delivering
basic services and ensuring  effective  governance  and  management  of  the
cities, the towns and rural areas where our people live.

It is therefore important that this sphere of government  is  supported  and
strengthened to play  these  roles  effectively.  Apart  from  material  and
technical  support  given,  it  is  also  crucial   to   ensure   that   the
institutional systems of local government are of such  a  nature  that  they
enable it to respond to the challenges. Our  new  local  government  system,
which is rated amongst the best  in  the  world,  is  an  evolving  one.  It
therefore requires of us to keep a  watchful  eye  on  it,  nurture  it  and
support it so that it becomes a truly robust system  that  delivers  to  our
people. The transformation of local government requires that, as the  system
develops, we continuously assess the situation on the ground and  allow  its
dynamism and vibrancy to adapt and flourish without major shifts in policy.

It was with this in mind that visionaries who drafted the Local  Government:
Municipal Structures  Act  of  1998  saw  it  fit  to  build  the  necessary
flexibilities into  the  system  to  allow  for  it  to  adapt  to  changing
conditions. One of the provisions of the Act empowers the  MECs  responsible
for local government to  change  types  of  municipalities.  While  this  is
policy  already,  it  has  become  quite  difficult  to  implement,  due  to
constraints imposed by other provisions in the same Act. The Bill  therefore
seeks to do away with these constraints, create internal consistency in  the
Act and thereby allow for the policy  to  be  implemented  without  hurdles.
Therefore the Bill neither introduces policy nor does it represent a  policy
shift.

This Bill also seeks to create certainty  in  the  legislation  itself,  and
within  the  local  government  sector  as  a  whole,  as  to  the   precise
interpretation of  the  Act.  It  seeks  to  remove  any  doubt  as  to  the
application of the provisions that  enable  the  MECs  to  change  types  of
municipalities. It clarifies what changes will happen  -  that  is,  end  of
term for members of executive committees  and  end  of  term  for  executive
mayors,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  type  of  change  in  a  given
municipality. It also provides for triggers to  ensure  that  municipalities
put in place structures and functionaries as a result of change of type.

While it is crucial to provide for flexibility in our system, we  also  need
to be vigilant to ensure that this flexibility is not abused.  We  therefore
need at all times to manage the tension between flexibility and the need  to
tighten our laws so that they are not open to manipulation. To  this  extent
the Bill introduces measures to tighten the legislation. This is  especially
so with regard to the positions of mayors, executive  mayors  and  deputies.
These are important as the type of a municipality is tied to the type  of  a
mayor you can have. The Bill seeks to ensure that  the  term  of  office  of
these mayors remains the same irrespective of the  change  in  the  type  of
municipality. Without this, you could have one person  serving  as  a  mayor
for life each time a type changes. In the same  vein,  the  Bill  introduces
measures  that  would  allow  these  mayors  to  serve  their   full   terms
irrespective of change of type. This  is  important  for  stability  in  our
system of governance.

I wish  to  assure  this  hon  House  and  the  public  at  large  that  all
implications have been considered and that the Ministry and  the  department
are satisfied that there are no foreseeable negative  implications  for  our
municipalities. The system of local government will continue to function  in
line with the checks and balances built into  our  legislation  to  minimise
any disruption in service delivery when  a  change  happens  midstream.  The
department  will,  however,  work  with  provinces   and   organised   local
government to monitor the situation closely  and  intervene  when  the  need
arises.

I would  like  to  thank  the  Chairperson  and  members  of  the  Portfolio
Committee for Provincial and Local  Government  for  giving  our  system  of
local government another chance to flourish.  I  also  extend  my  heartfelt
gratitude to  our  officials  for  their  continued  support.  Madam  Deputy
Speaker, I now place before  this  House  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
Structures Second Amendment Bill. I thank you.

Mr B J NOBUNGA: Hon Deputy Speaker, the Bill  before  this  House  seeks  to
amend  the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Structures  Act  to   allow   for
municipalities to change from  one  type  of  executive  system  to  another
during the same term of  office  of  the  municipality.  The  changes  would
happen in municipalities as necessitated from time to time through  crossing
the floor in municipalities, if need be, and/or when municipalities  are  of
the view that effecting such changes in the  type  of  an  executive  system
would result in enhanced delivery of service  and/or  better  and  effective
municipalities.

The current provisions in the Local  Government:  Municipal  Structures  Act
are such that they disadvantage a new mayor who replaces an incumbent  mayor
who vacates his or her seat or position in that the period  that  the  mayor
would serve is regarded as a full term of office regardless  of  the  length
or period. However, the amendments would  ensure  that  they  correct  these
anomalies and provide  for  a  similar  provision  which  applies  in  other
offices as stipulated  in  the  Constitution  regarding  the  President  and
premiers. So, from the time that this amending Bill  is  enacted  into  law,
those mayors who are filling positions of vacating  mayors  will  enjoy  the
benefit of starting a new term that would be considered to be  a  full  term
of office at the end of the municipal term of office for which they  replace
or fill positions of the mayors who are vacating such positions.

Thirdly, the amendment will also allow for a mayor  to  serve  a  full  term
which is measured in the same way as the term of a municipality, as  opposed
to a situation wherein change in the type  of  the  executive  system  would
have led to that of a mayor having to complete two  terms  within  the  same
term of the municipality. The amendment, therefore, makes  it  possible  for
that mayor to come for a second term of office and not regard the change  in
the type of the executive system as a new  term  of  office.  Also,  in  the
current provision, the  two  systems  of  mayoral  types  were  regarded  as
different. A person would have served  two  consecutive  terms  under  each,
thus making the overall period of eligibility a  total  of  20  years'  turn
under each mayoral type of executive  system.  But  the  current  provisions
limit the period to 10 years combined, should it happen  that  the  type  of
executive system is changed while the same person is in office.
Fourthly, the Bill provides for continuity in that it  allows  a  person  to
serve two consecutive terms as a deputy mayor and then continue for  another
two consecutive terms as a mayor. But, at the same time, the Bill  prohibits
a mayor who has served  his  or  her  full  term  from  being  eligible  for
election as a deputy mayor. We reaffirm this position as it tries  to  limit
the possibility of the undermining of a new mayor by the  person  who  fully
understands the office after having served for  between  10  and  20  years.
This, we hope, also allows room for new blood to come in  with  fresh  ideas
and without undue influence on the manner in which the new mayor is  to  run
his or her office.

Angephetse ngekutsi ngisho lokutsi  nome  ngabe  belikhona  litfuba  lekutsi
abekhona sodolobha longahle aphatse lihhovisi likuba  ngusodolobha  iminyaka
lengetulu  kweli-14  netinyanga  letitsite  ngetulu,  loko  kutabe  kulivela

lesingaphansi kweminyaka lemibili bese uvalwa ngulomunye lotawungena  kuleso
sikhundla. (Translation of Siswati paragraph follows.)

[Let me conclude by saying that even though there would  be  an  opportunity
for another mayor to take over as head of the office of  a  mayor  for  more
than 14 years and some months, that would be a rare thing  to  have  happen.
The reason is that it is not a common thing that  one  would  find,  that  a
person is a mayor for less than a year or two before another takes over  his
position.]

We hope that the amendment will enhance the functionality of  municipalities
and contribute to stability and progress at the local government level.  The
ANC supports the Local Government:  Municipal  Structures  Second  Amendment
Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs G M BORMAN: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  this  proposed  amendment  clarifies
what the terms of office will be for executive committees, executive  mayors
and deputy executive mayors when  there  is  a  change  of  system,  as  has
already been indicated. The DA supports the amendment. However, because  the
change in type is mainly, although not exclusively, from an  executive  type
to an executive mayoral type, it is an opportune moment  for  the  House  to
pause and re-evaluate the executive mayoral  system.  The  weakness  of  the
executive mayoral system is the exclusion of  opposition  parties  from  the
mayoral committee.

On a recent tour of municipalities which the portfolio committee  undertook,
the failure of the executive mayoral system was glaringly  apparent  in  the
Johannesburg unicity. Not only are opposition  parties  excluded  even  from
observer status, but they do not even see agendas until a whole month  after
a meeting. In the systems Act a whole  chapter  is  devoted  to  performance
management, and rightly so. But, in Johannesburg, the  DA  as  the  official
opposition generally were not consulted on performance  objectives  and  had
to read about the key performance indicators  for  the  two  top  levels  of
management when these were printed in the media. They were not  even  passed
by the council. This is not acceptable in a multiparty democracy.

The executive mayoral system, when abused, is a blatant case of the ANC  yet
further whittling away at the democratic checks  and  balances  that  ensure
transparency and accountability, and which guard  against  corruption.  With
municipal  managers  now  being  political  appointments  and  the   mayoral
committee consisting of all of the mayor's buddies,  where  are  the  checks
and  balances?  We  need  early  warning  systems  and  usually  it  is  the
opposition who provide the early warning system.

I know that we are trying to model the mayoral  committee  on  the  Cabinet,
but more is the pity. Local government does not sit at some  lofty  distance
from the people. Local government is at the  coalface  where  people  expect
delivery and constituencies need to be represented to ensure  that  delivery
takes place. The DA wants to see a  far  more  transparent  and  accountable
system. The executive mayoral system offers a carte blanche  for  the  abuse
of power, inefficiency, corruption and cloak-and-dagger  skulduggery,  as  I
have already shown.

In the Eastern Cape, the DA MPL,  Bobby  Stevenson,  acting  on  information
from one of our councillors in the Ndlambe municipality,  Louise  Swanepoel,
has been able  to  expose  the  illegal  appointment  of  full-time  mayors.
Correct procedure was not followed and they will now have to  pay  back  the
money. There are some 11  municipalities  involved  here.  The  DA  will  be
vigilant over ensuring that that money is paid back.

In a report of the United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime  regarding
government corruption, it is said that the public servants  most  guilty  of
corruption  are  the  police,  customs  officials,  local  government,  home
affairs and court officials. That is an  international  group's  assessment,
not  an  opposition  report.  It  throws  the  spotlight  on  the  secretive
shenanigans for which this Government has become so renowned.

Of course, this Bill merely seeks to clarify existing  legislation.  The  DA
supports it. [Applause.]

Mrs S A SEATON: Madam Speaker and hon members, the Bill deals  with  certain
consequences arising from a change in type before the expiry of  the  normal
term of office. As the law stands at the moment, a province may  change  the
type of municipality from one  type  to  another,  collective  executive  to
executive mayor or vice versa.

However, certain consequences of this were not  regulated  in  the  original
Local Government: Municipal Structures Act because they were not  adequately
anticipated. There  is,  however,  a  need  for  regulation  in  respect  of
certain, but not all, changes of type in the light of the  impending  change
to the type in the Cape Town metro.

One consequence of a change of type is that the term of  office  of  members
may change, eg an exco member, in the case of a collective  executive  type,
is elected until the next  council  is  elected  for  a  standard  five-year
provision or,  according  to  the  present  amendment,  until  the  type  is
changed. The same provision applies in respect of an executive  mayor.  This
is logical because certain positions do not apply to certain types and  they
cannot continue in existence once a type is changed.

Another consequence deals with the successive terms of office and whether  a
vacancy is in fact created by virtue of a change of type. We see no  problem
in the notion that a vacancy does not arise because the change of  type  has
the effect of terminating that office rather than creating  the  vacancy  in
the office. Serving the balance of the term  in  the  different  office  is,
therefore, not to be construed as filling  a  vacancy.  Of  course,  if  the
change occurs towards the end of a term then the remaining  period  is  very
short. By the same token, however, it can occur earlier in a term, in  which
event the individual could hypothetically  benefit.  However,  this  is  not
likely to be  a  frequent  occurrence  and  the  complexity  of  drafting  a
provision in respect of what are arbitrary cut-off points negates  the  need
to pursue the matter further.

A further committee amendment deals with the issue raised  by  the  IFP.  In
the Act, a mayor or an executive mayor may enjoy only two  successive  terms
of office in addition to serving  as  a  deputy  mayor.  However,  this  was
drafted in such a manner that, if read with the change  of  type  provision,
an individual could in fact enjoy four  successive  terms  as  a  mayor,  in
addition to two preceding terms as a deputy mayor. This  is  likewise  being
remedied by conflating the  different  mayoral  offices  into  one  and  the
proposal on the table appears a reasonable response to the problems  raised.


All in all, we do not see any major policy issues being raised by  the  Bill
and, in respect of amendments made, our concerns have been taken  on  board.
The IFP does support this Bill.

Mnr W P DOMAN: Geagte Adjunkspeaker, die Nuwe NP  sal  graag  wil  sien  dat
elke munisipale raad hulself afvra of hulle in  die  lig  van  die  afgelope
twee jaar se ondervinding die regte soort munisipaliteit het en indien  nie,
hul LUR nader om  dit  te  verander.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr W P DOMAN: Hon Deputy Speaker, the  New  NP  would  like  to  see  every
municipal council ask itself whether, in the light of the  past  two  years'
experience, it has the right kind of municipality, and  if  not,  it  should
approach the MEC to change this.]

If a municipality chooses the executive mayoral type,  the  one  issue  that
the New NP feels strongly about is  that  the  executive  mayoral  committee
meetings should take  place  with  open  doors.  In  municipalities  in  the
Western Cape, where we govern with the ANC, we have agreed on  this.  It  is
unfortunate that the practice develops  that  executive  mayoral  committees
meet  behind  closed  doors.  Legally,  this  is  possible  because  mayoral
committees are not the same  as  the  other  municipal  committee  meetings,
which must normally be open. Mayoral committees can and normally do  consist
only of one party. By meeting behind closed doors, they  are  probably  safe
in a caucus meeting.

The very fact, however, that  mayoral  committees  are  a  one-party  affair
points to the fact that closed  meetings  could  portray  an  impression  of
secrecy. We must remember that, in the local government sphere, there is  no
separation of powers between legislative and the executive.  What  is  more,
municipal councils delegate powers to executive mayors. This  is  of  course
something that Parliament will never do. Therefore, it is  wrong  to  equate
mayoral committees with the Cabinet at national level and  use  this  as  an
excuse to meet behind closed doors.

The only similarity is that the executive mayor  appoints  a  committee  and
their term is  linked  to  his  or  hers.  Mayoral  committee  meetings  are
statutory meetings with council officials present, which  poses  the  danger
that they are drawn in to what can be perceived as a caucus meeting if  held
behind closed doors. The mere fact that an executive mayor must  report  all
decisions to the council is  also  not  enough  excuse  for  meeting  behind
closed doors. The public and other councillors have a  right  to  know  what
the motivation is when a decision is taken. The time that lapses  between  a
mayoral committee meeting and the report  of  it  to  the  council  can,  in
certain circumstances, be crucial for  insiders  who  have  knowledge  which
others will only receive later. It is also crucial that  in  some  instances
those decisions take effect before the council can discuss it.

Government must be as transparent as possible, and since 1994 this has  been
the hallmark of ANC rule and one wants to applaud the ANC for  it.  However,
the development in the past two years of closed mayoral  committee  meetings
does not serve this democratic notion. Why can  over  200  councils  conduct
everything in the open, but the other 80 or so not? When making  the  choice
for the type of municipality, this should not be at the  back  of  the  mind
regarding why municipalities will want to switch to  the  executive  mayoral
system.

The New NP wants to call on all executive mayors to open  up  their  mayoral
committee meetings and on the ANC who,  of  course,  overwhelmingly  governs
the municipalities, where the executive  mayor  type  is  in  operation,  to
enforce this on their members. [Applause.]

Mr D G MKONO: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Minister and hon members, the  Local
Government: Municipal Structures Second Amendment  Bill  before  this  House
today addresses the uncertainty in the original Act regarding the  terms  of
office of municipal executive office bearers.

The original Act does not provide for the type of  the  municipality  to  be
changed in terms of its executive  composition,  from  either  an  executive
mayoral type to an executive committee type  or  vice  versa.  However,  the
original Act was not specific in its determination of the  terms  of  office
of municipal executive office bearers in circumstances  where  the  type  of
municipality is changed. The Bill clears up  the  uncertainty  by  providing
that a change from one type to another requires  that  the  affected  office
bearers vacate their positions within  14  days.  In  and  of  itself,  this
arrangement is acceptable and fits well  within  the  legislative  framework
regulating local government.

What is of concern is that these  changes  were  necessitated  by  municipal
changes following local government  defections  last  year.  These  are  the
unintended  and  potentially  expensive  consequences  of   disrupting   the
governance, twice in every term, for  public  representatives  to  cross  or
double cross the floor as  they  please.  Local  government  and,  for  that
matter, any other sphere of government,  requires  continuity  to  focus  on
service delivery. Millions of South Africans cannot afford  the  willy-nilly
change of the executive type of local government, which grinds  delivery  to
a halt as new office bearers are  chosen  and  familiarise  themselves  with
policies and systems. More stringent guidelines to  restrict  these  changes
are required. The UDM therefore support this Bill. [Applause.]

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, the ACDP does not support  this  Bill,  so
we are voting against it.

Parliament has systematically silenced the ACDP by giving us one  minute  to
articulate legislation, and I want to say it is  impossible  to  do  so.  We
notice the time allocation that is provided for farewells and tributes,  but
when it comes to important legislation, we are given one minute. So  we,  as
the ACDP, protest. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, on  a  point  of
order: Is it correct and parliamentary for an  hon  member  to  allege  that
Parliament, as an institution created  in  terms  of  our  Constitution,  is
silencing her when, by agreement of all parties, parties  receive  the  time
that is proportionally due to them in terms of their electoral support?

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Honourable member, it is actually not correct  to
say that Parliament is silencing hon members. In fact, it is the  electorate
that determines the support a party has, and the time has  been  distributed
accordingly. If there are issues and ways  of  dealing  with  these  matters
among  parties,  please  let  us  pursue  them,  instead  of  attacking  the
institution. Will you now proceed, hon member.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, let me say it  is  Parliament  because  we
have taken it up many times with the Chief Whip; we have  taken  the  matter
to the Speaker and nobody listens to us. We raise this issue every  time  we
only get one minute to speak. It is impossible.  One  cannot  articulate  in
any debate and, many times, we have put forward our position  but  it  falls
on deaf ears. So the public must hear that Government wants to  silence  the
ACDP so that now that the elections are nearing  they  know  that  they  can
keep us quiet. They have  even  done  so  with  Rule  105  that  deals  with
statements. The ACDP does not withdraw. We still protest.
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, if  you  are  still  continuing  with
your speech, will you carry on. If you have nothing to say, will you  please
resume your seat so that we can go on to the next speaker.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Madam Speaker, I have seven seconds left.

Ms C DUDLEY:  Madam  Speaker,  on  a  point  of  order:  The  member  has  a
constitutional right to silence.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! That is not a point of order.

Mr I S MFUNDISI: Deputy Speaker,  the  intended  changes  in  the  types  of
municipalities in terms of  the  office  of  executive  mayors  provide  for
dynamism in the institutions.

The institutions should not be left static to  the  extent  that  those  who
hold office develop roots. The provision that executive  mayors  and  deputy
executive mayors should hold office for not more than two consecutive  terms
is most welcome.

It is appreciated that amendments are brought forward even  before  the  end
of the first five  years,  lest  the  amendments  be  interpreted  as  being
directed at certain people.

The Bill also makes room for a municipality of one type to be  changed  into
one of another type. The amendments  make  provision  for  other  people  to
aspire to higher office and service. There should be  no  feeling  that  the
positions are cut and dried for some and not others.

On those grounds, the UCDP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Speaker,  the  provisions  made  to  accommodate  the
executive  committee  or  the  executive  mayoral  type  of  structure   are
adequately set out to act as a firm backbone to the plans and  practices  of
local government structures. This is a step closer to activating  intentions
and aims adequately and effectively.  Secondly,  the  importance  of  having
able and dedicated persons in such positions would ensure greater success.

The allocation of a timeframe is important  to  ensure  that  the  effective
conveyance of the changes is made timeously. The vacating of the seat of  an
executive committee member when changes are made to  the  executive  mayoral
type is supported, as  long  as  the  person  vacating  the  seat  is  given
sufficient time to do so.

However, the MF has to note the submission made by the Community Law  Centre
that the proposed amendment does not address the ``when'' issue, but  rather
the ``who'' issue, and further  that  the  amendments  only  deal  with  the
changeover from a collective executive type of  municipality  to  a  mayoral
executive type of municipality and vice versa. What about the  plenary  type
of municipality to a mayoral type of municipality?

The MF supports the Local Government: Municipal Structures Second  Amendment
Bill. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Madam Speaker, one seat,  one  minute,  I  will  try  my  best.
[Laughter.]

Hierdie wetsontwerp het  die  geleentheid  gebied  om  meer  as  net  enkele
tegniese sake rakende die oorgang  na  uitvoerende  burgemeesters  te  reël.
Tans setel daar te veel mag in een persoon:  die  uitvoerende  burgemeester.
Rade word in baie gevalle blote  rubberstempels  vir  die  mag  wat  in  een
persoon sentreer, en vir besluite wat agter geslote deure geneem is.

Hoewel vergoedingskale  van  uitvoerende  burgemeesters  sentraal  vasgestel
word, word luukse empires deur uitvoerende burgemeesters gebou in terme  van
luukse ampsmotors  en  ampswonings  van  etlike  miljoene.  Dit  terwyl  die
skuldlas van plaaslike owerhede astronomiese  bedrae  beloop!  Die  werklike
soustrein loop op die plaaslike vlak.

Die AEB is ten gunste van maksimale afwenteling  van  gesag.  Ongelukkig  is
dit tans so dat die derde span soms die meeste droogmaak.  In  die  lig  van
die groot bedrag wat deur die  sentrale  begroting  aan  plaaslike  owerhede
toegeken word, moet wetgewing daargestel word wat hierdie luukshede  beperk.


Die AEB steun hierdie wetsontwerp, maar vra ook verdere  wetgewing  wat  die
beperkte bronne van Suid-Afrika, ook op plaaslike vlak,  sal  kanaliseer  na
die gemeenskappe wat gedien moet word, en na nie die  konings  op  die  goue
trone  nie.  Ek  het  nog  twee  sekondes   oor:   Ek   dank   u.   [Gelag.]
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)
[This Bill  offers  the  opportunity  to  regulate  more  than  just  a  few
technical matters affecting the transition to  executive  mayors.  There  is
currently too much power vested in one person: the executive mayor. In  many
cases councils become mere rubber stamps for the power which is  centralised
in one person, and for decisions which are taken behind closed doors.

Although remuneration scales for executive mayors are centrally  determined,
luxurious empires are built by executive mayors in terms of luxury  official
vehicles and official residences worth  several  millions.  This  while  the
debt burden of local authorities amounts to astronomical amounts!  The  real
gravy train is running at the local level.

The AEB is in favour of maximal devolution of power.  Unfortunately,  it  is
currently the case that the third team sometimes bungles the  most.  In  the
light of the large amount allocated to  local  authorities  by  the  central
budget, legislation must be introduced which restricts these luxuries.

The AEB supports this Bill, but  also  requests  further  legislation  which
will channel the limited resources of South Africa, also at a  local  level,
to the communities which have to be served, and not  to  the  kings  on  the
golden thrones. I still have two seconds  left:  I  thank  you.  [Laughter.]
[Interjections.]

Mr Y I CARRIM: Madam Speaker,  comrades  and  friends,  this  Bill  must  be
placed in  the  context  of  the  overall  local  government  transformation
process. And in  fact  many  observers  have  pointed  out  that  our  local
government transformation is possibly one of the  most  ambitious  and  most
advanced local government projects anywhere in the world. And  they  put  it
to us when we were drafting and  crafting  this  legislation  that  we  were
expecting to do too much too soon. We  have  just  in  fact  come  back,  as
Gloria Borman has said, from  a  very  exhaustive  study  tour  of  some  41
municipalities.

Now I think most of us would agree that, given that it is 2 years on from  5
December 2000, we are certainly doing very well, even if it is not  as  well
as we should be doing, but certainly, it is far better than is made  out  in
the public discourse. As this  transition  unfolds  we  obviously  begin  to
understand that there are aspects of our legislation that need  fine-tuning,
that need greater certainty and, as many speakers before me and  the  Deputy
Minister explained, what we are doing here in this Bill is  not  introducing
anything fundamentally new. We merely have, in the  legislation  in  section
12, the opportunity to change the type of  municipality  from  one  type  to
another. All we are doing in this Bill is providing the certainty  that  you
can do that, the conditions in which you can do it and the  consequences  of
that.

And what I want say is that I think many of the speakers  who  spoke  before
me, partly because they were not here when we  were  drafting  the  original
structures  Act,  misunderstand  the  nature   of   the   different   types.
Essentially there are two types. There is what  you  know  as  a  multiparty
collective executive type in which all parties, based on the  proportion  of
votes they secure, are represented. Then there is the other type,  which  is
the executive mayoral type in  which  the  majority  party  constitutes  the
executive. If it so chooses, it can include members from the other  parties.


There are people saying that these executive mayoral  committees  should  be
open, that their minutes should be freely  available,  and  that,  in  fact,
opposition parties should observe. Well, that is patently not on. There  are
two systems, the one is the collective multiparty  executive  and,  in  that
type, those things can happen, but  this  is  a  system  that  is  different
precisely because it is different. In other words, if we are going to  speak
about all three spheres of government, it means  what  applies  to  a  large
extent to national and provincial  levels  must  also  apply  to  the  local
level. So nobody in this Parliament says - the  DP  doesn't,  nor  does  any
other party - that they want to observe President Mbeki's  Cabinet  meetings
or that they want minutes from President Mbeki's Cabinet  meetings.  So  you
can't expect the same at local government level. You can't win  through  law
what you have lost in the ballot box. [Applause.] If you are  an  opposition
party, you have to deal with that as an opposition party.

Thirdly, if you look at this system, one of its salient features is that  we
created a much more powerful executive system  and  began  to  separate  ...
Where is Johnny de Lange? My colleague is not here. He always  debates  this
with me. We sought, through the system, to separate out  the  executive  and
the legislature at  the  local  government  level.  So  whether  you  are  a
collective executive or a mayoral executive type, you have far  more  powers
now with the new system than you had previously.

Fourthly, it is not as if  the  mayoral  executive  committee  has  all  the
powers. Those powers are delegated by a council to which it  is  accountable
in monthly meetings; at the very  least  four  meetings  a  year,  but  most
councils  have  8  to  10  meetings,  and  a  council  can  withdraw   those
delegations if the mayoral executive is abusing it.

Furthermore, if you look at the constitutional challenge put by the DA,  the
courts finally found that it is entirely correct and legitimate and  legally
sound and  constitutionally  sound  to  have  mayoral  executive  committees
comprising the party that has won. Show me in which democracy in  the  world
- this is the challenge I put to my colleagues here -  a  losing  party  has
the right that they are  demanding,  the  right  to  observe  at  a  Cabinet
meeting, and the right to actually have minutes of a Cabinet meeting. In  no
democracy in the world, not even in the most advanced social democracy  like
Sweden, can an opposition party demand it, unless  of  course  the  majority
party decides to include opposition parties in an alliance.

Furthermore, it is not as if municipalities decide that they  are  going  to
be one type rather than another. It is the MECs that decide these types  and
there is an alternative - the multiparty collective executive.

May I go on and say, Miss Rajbally, with due respect to you,  that  you  are
wrong in what you are saying. Regarding the issues that were raised by  Nico
Statle, he himself  conceded  that  they  were  actually  not  substantially
correct and, in fact, the concerns that he expressed have been  catered  for
in the amendments we have made. What he in fact said was  not  substantially
correct in the first place, but that is neither here nor there. Because  you
weren't at the meeting, needless to say, you don't know.

I want to say finally, before we  part  here,  that  while  we  agree  as  a
portfolio committee that it is useful to clarify that you  can  change  from
one type to another, it is not  as  if  the  portfolio  committee  feels  we
should change the types all the time. In fact, there is a sense in which  we
think, having come back from the study tour of  municipalities,  that  there
is a sense of transformation fatigue, if you like, at the  local  government
level. So while we support the change of types,  we  are  clear  that  these
types should not be changed too readily and at a whim. It is a big thing  to
change types, and it means the composition of executives changes and so  on,
and so we shouldn't go for it too soon.

Thanks to all the parties for their co-operation  and  especially  to  Slips
Seleshu and Peter Bower from the department and  the  parliamentary  liaison
officers for all their co-operation. Let's see how it works out. I think  it
is a very good Bill. It is a very sober, sensible, moderate,  and  temperate
amendment to the legislation, once again confirming what  we  understood  in
the study tour with the Deputy Minister: that, in fact, what we found  after
our visit to those 41 municipalities is that, overall, the core features  of
this new model of local government are not being contested. Here  and  there
we might have to tinker with legislation. It reaffirms the view  that  where
you consult, as was done by our predecessors with the White  Paper  process,
through enormous workshops and so on - in fact, it  was  a  10-year  process
before we arrived at this model - these things are more substantially  sound
and  less  susceptible  to  amendments.  And  this  is,  frankly,  a   minor
amendment. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT: Deputy  Speaker,  I
would like to thank all the members who  participated  in  this  debate  and
those parties that have supported this Bill.

The last time I was here discussing the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Laws
Amendment Bill, I said that the process  of  transforming  local  government
presents numerous challenges and it can  be  expected  that,  from  time  to
time, we would have to make these interventions, as they may be necessary.

I am, however, saddened by the hon Southgate who started off  by  indicating
that her party is opposed to this Bill, but I think the  more  serious  part
is that she deprived the electorate and those who voted  for  the  ACDP  and
those whom she represents  of  an  opportunity  to  hear  her  viewpoint  by
sticking that red tape across her mouth and saying  nothing.  It  is  a  sad
thing because I am certain that the electorate would have loved to hear  her
opposing views.

To the hon Borman, I would just like to say that she raised the point  about
reviewing  the  executive  mayoral  system  because  she  objects   to   the
opposition being excluded,  but  that  we  will  not  review  the  executive
mayoral system merely for the sake of including the DP. I think that  it  is
not so much a review of the system that is required, but what is  needed  is
for us to work together to make our new system  of  local  government  work.
And I think if you listened very carefully to  the  last  speaker,  the  hon
Carrim, you would understand what it means.

I want, once more, to thank the portfolio committee, the officials  and  all
who participated in this debate. Thank you very much indeed.

Debate concluded.

                 NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The  MINISTER  OF  SOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT:   Mr   Chairperson,   the   National
Development Agency is a critical component of our  country's  apparatus  for
dealing with the underdevelopment, deprivation and poverty that  impacts  so
heavily on the daily lives of  many  South  Africans.  It  is  also  a  very
important institution as  far  as  working  towards  the  national  goal  of
sustainable development is concerned.

In terms of the NDA Act of 1998, the mandate of the NDA is  unambiguous.  It
has to,  firstly,  grant  funds  to  civil  society  organisations  for  the
purposes of meeting the developmental needs of poor  communities;  secondly,
strengthen the institutional capacity of  civil  society  organisations  for
long-term sustainability; thirdly, proactively source  funds  for  the  NDA;
fourthly,  promote  consultation,  dialogue  and  sharing  of  developmental
experience to debate and influence developmental  policy;  and,  lastly,  it
has to develop  strategies  to  collaborate  with  local  community  trusts,
foundations and government clusters.

Since October 2001, the NDA  has  been  funded  through  the  Department  of
Social Development. In its first year of operation,  the  NDA  disbursed  an
amount in excess  of  R100  million  from  Government  to  fund  development
projects  in  the  areas  of  education  and  training,   health,   economic
development, rural development and urban development. Our intention is  that
the business of the NDA should serve to complement and not to duplicate  the
programmes of the Department of Social Development. The national  department
is tasked with the formulation and  monitoring  of  policy.  The  provincial
departments design programmes and implement the policy.

The NDA, on the other hand, is tasked with the broad developmental  function
that involves the sourcing and distribution of funds across the  country  in
a way that promotes social  and  economic  sustainability  among  its  civil
society partners. In so doing,  the  National  Development  Agency  aims  to
ensure that community involvement in poverty alleviation and development  is
enhanced, hon George.

Much of the enormous task of halving  the  incidence  of  poverty  in  South
Africa by the year 2015 thus rests in the hands of the NDA.  Ultimately,  of
course, we all hope that we will be in  a  position  to  move  from  poverty
alleviation to  poverty  eradication  in  the  foreseeable  future.  In  the
meantime, there is  much  work  to  be  done.  The  responsibility  for  the
distribution of huge allocations of funding to organisations that are  often
inexperienced and lacking in capacity is immense. This is even  more  so  in
rural  areas,  where  the  levels  of  poverty  and   underdevelopment   are
devastating.

Estimates are that 70% of the people living in the rural areas are poor  and
the majority of them are women.  Conversely,  however,  most  civil  society
organisations currently in operation are urban-based. The NDA will  have  to
play a central role in redressing this situation. With these imperatives  in
mind, it is critical that the management of the NDA  conducts  itself  in  a
fully transparent and scrupulous fashion. The credentials of the  management
and board of the NDA should be  impeccable.  The  task  cannot  be  assigned
light-heartedly and without serious thought.

Given its popular mandate from the voters of this  country,  Government  is,
therefore, obliged to maintain an oversight role  and  to  ensure  that  the
business of the NDA is conducted without  prejudice  against  the  poor  and
without preference being shown to any group or any region of this country.
The Department of Social Development is  strengthening  its  monitoring  and
evaluation capacity and its lines of  communication  and  co-operation  with
the NDA. The intention is to facilitate the functioning of the NDA,  an  NDA
that is accountable, efficient and effective in delivering  on  its  mandate
to the poorest of the poor.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  E  SALOOJEE:  Mr  Chairperson,  every  year  since  the  transition   to
democracy, our call from  this  podium  has  focused  on  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty.

In his state of the nation address, on  14  February,  our  President  again
highlighted the challenge of ensuring that we reduce the  number  of  people
dependent on social welfare and increase the numbers  that  rely  for  their
livelihood on normal participation in the economy.

However, the President also made the  point  that  Government  alone  cannot
carry the challenge of fighting and eradicating poverty in South Africa  and
creating  independent  economic   activity.   There   has   to   be   active
collaboration  between  Government  and  civil  society.  This  is  why   an
institution like the NDA has such a crucial role to play in the  development
of our people in our communities.

During the apartheid era, civil society  organisations  made  a  substantial
contribution to development, delivery and the  building  of  democracy.  The
development was, in fact, as a result of  the  apartheid  state's  conscious
decision to shift the responsibility for development services  onto  welfare
agencies, designed  to  serve  the  interests  of  a  very  small  minority.
Development funding from  foreign  donors  played  a  crucial  role  in  the
survival of most of the organisations that  were  organising  the  poor  and
deprived communities of our country.

Shortly after the transition  to  democracy,  nongovernmental  organisations
experienced a serious crisis in funding. Because the  overseas  donors  were
channelling their  money  directly  to  Government,  it  became  imperative,
therefore, to establish an agency that could act as a conduit for  funds  to
civil society organisations.

The National Development Agency was established on  1  April  2000,  with  a
view to  providing  a  space  for  Government  and  civil  society  to  come
together, reaching consensus on development priorities and how to reach  out
and to mobilise communities.

Civil society organisations were, correctly, very hopeful that  this  agency
would be both a source of funding and a resource for  capacity-building  and
community development.

However, we have all been very  concerned  about  the  serious  difficulties
experienced by the NDA. It took the agency nearly a year before it was  able
to grant any organisations money from its  fund  and  seriously  compromised
its relations with the European Union. There was over R48 million  in  donor
money it couldn't spend.

There have also been suggestions that the NDA doesn't have the  capacity  to
really monitor and support those projects to which it awards moneys. It  was
clear to all of us that the NDA was not functioning optimally,  and  in  the
light of this observation  we  welcome  the  transfer  of  the  NDA  to  the
Ministry of Social Development.

We believe that in this environment it could, perhaps, start playing a  much
more effective role in mobilising communities and  fostering  a  partnership
between Government and civil society.  The  legislation,  therefore,  before
us, as the Minister has already suggested,  seeks  to  give  effect  to  the
transfer from Finance to Social Development.

The following amendments are being made to the NDA Act: an amendment to  the
definition of the Ministry in order to provide that the NDA is  administered
by the Minister of Social Development; a change in the  composition  of  the
board of the NDA by reducing the members of the  board  from  15  to  11;  a
reduction in the number of members required for the  quorum  of  the  board,
consistent with  the  reduction  of  the  membership  from  15  to  11,  and
providing for the Minister to appoint the chief  executive  officer  of  the
NDA upon the recommendation of the board.

The discussions in the committee around the composition of  the  board  were
lengthy, and some concerns were raised about the  fact  that  civil  society
representation on the board is not weighed heavily enough. We would like  to
say that the number of people on either side is not the real issue.

We are not talking about competing priorities or interests. At the heart  of
the matter is how members of the board, as  representatives  of  both  civil
society and Government, operationalise for the NDA, and the vision  that  we
all have of developing our people into economically active  members  of  the
communities, and thereby restoring their dignity.

At the heart of the matter is the desire for developing ways of  effectively
reaching out to communities and mobilising these communities, and  for  this
we need consensus amongst those persons serving on the board.

Despite the problems that the NDA has been experiencing, it appears  there's
been some real development in the manner in which the agency is  approaching
their  funding  and  support  role.  The  NDA  has   recognised   that   the
proliferation of small projects that have little  means  of  support,  aside
from start-up funding, is not ideal and cannot be sustained over  a  medium-
term to long-term period.

It is encouraging to note that the NDA wants to respond  to  this  awareness
by moving away from direct financial  involvement  and  its  small  isolated
projects, to a more  broad-ranging  involvement  with  bigger  projects  and
programmes.

The NDA states that such larger projects will be  more  viable  because  the
scale would ensure that market impact would be  substantial.  The  portfolio
committee has repeatedly seen, on its provincial visits, that  unless  there
is sustained support over a range of issues, small  projects  cannot  become
sustainable.

So, let the NDA explore ways of clustering homogenous smaller  projects  and
consolidating  these  into  a  single  programme.  The  committee  has  also
expressed its concern about the fact that there doesn't seem to be a  strong
awareness at project level that Government funding cannot last forever,  and
that, at some point, the project would have to stand on its own.

But, then, support aimed at fostering sustainability must  be  real  and  it
must be visible. The NDA must support  programmes,  not  only  in  providing
them with funds, but also in  playing  an  active  role  in  monitoring  and
mentoring and, when it cannot do this,  identify  those  organisations  that
are able to play this role.

We  must  also  remind  those  representatives  of  Government,  due  to  be
appointed to the board, that poverty is an intersectoral  issue.  You  have,
as a representative of Agriculture, of Public Works, of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry, to identify those resources in your  own  departments  that  could
contribute to the sustainability of projects funded by  the  NDA,  and  then
facilitate the utilisation of those resources.

When the committee visited the state of Kerala this month, we  visited  some
very interesting poverty eradication programmes,  and  we'd  like  to  share
some of our insights. I believe one of the most  important  lessons  learned
is that the most effective community mobilisation might  not  occur  through
the work of large organisations.

In fact,  through  the  efforts  of  the  Kudumbashree  poverty  eradication
mission, small groups in communities are encouraged to organise  themselves,
identify their development needs and feed  these  needs  into  developmental
plans at the local level.

This mission not  only  links  the  small  groups  directly  to  sources  of
funding, but also provides them with training,  capacity-building,  and  the
kind of support that enables them to come up  with  development  plans  that
are sustainable.  It  also  ensures  that  a  partnership  develops  between
community-based  organisations   and   the   Development   Bank,   so   that
participants in these projects have access to microcredit.

This also helps beneficiaries of the project  to  develop  an  understanding
that they cannot rely on government funding alone, but  that  they  have  to
commit themselves to small loans and they have to repay these.

In fact, the 100% repayment history in Kerala suggests  what  we  have  been
saying for a long time: The poor are able to repay debts if they  are  given
a constructive environment in which to enter into loan agreements.

We will, over the next few months,  engage  with  the  NDA  to  explore  the
effectiveness of the approach in organising communities. I  want  to  appeal
to members  of  this  House  to  play  an  active  role  in  monitoring  the
development of projects in their constituencies.

If we fulfil this oversight function effectively, we would be in a  position
to ensure that the problems arising in the manner in which the  NDA  relates
to organisations that have applied for or received  funding  from  the  NDA,
could be addressed in the context of our parliamentary work.

I trust that the appointment of  a  new  board  for  the  NDA  will  proceed
smoothly and that we will be able to report and discuss  the  progress  made
by this grant-making body  over  the  next  few  months.  I  thank  you,  Mr
Chairman. [Applause.]

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES: Deputy Chair, the National  Development  Agency  was
set up to act as a partner  with  rural  communities  and  entrepreneurs  in
poverty eradication projects throughout the country.

With an opportunity focus, it concentrates on providing access to  resources
for poor communities. Most of the  projects  centre  on  education,  health,
economic development and rural development.

This Bill sets out to move the NDA  from  the  Finance  Ministry  to  Social
Development, and also to  change  the  composition  of  the  NDA  board.  In
principle, the DA supports this essentially technical  Bill  as  it  reduces
the number of members of the board from 15  to  11.  The  problem  we  have,
though, relates to the fact that the ratio on the board  between  Government
officials and members of  civil  society  is  being  altered  in  favour  of
Government - never a healthy option.

It is essential for the  NDA  to  be  seen  as  nonpartisan  and  completely
impartial, and the tilting of the  board  balance  does  not  help  in  this
regard. Let us not forget the imbroglio that spilled  over  into  the  media
recently between Minister Skweyiya and his  provincial  counterpart,  Gideon
Zulu. And this makes my point: in South Africa  today  it  is  so  easy  for
political point-scoring to cloud and taint projects. The NDA must  be  above
this, and that is why the DA supports the board having a  built-in  majority
of civil society members.

I see that Minister Skweyiya, in a statement today, has welcomed the  social
grant increases announced by  the  Minister  of  Finance  yesterday  in  his
Budget Speech. Let me agree wholeheartedly with the hon Minister,  but  also
warn that all of this could be scuppered at the delivery stage if his  plans
for this monolithic agency for  social  security,  presented  to  Parliament
yesterday, are realised.

Clearly,  there  are  huge   problems   with   the   current   system,   but
centralisation, certainly, is not the magic  wand,  Minister.  The  existing
system must be restructured and streamlined, and new  innovative  ideas  and
solutions must be  introduced.  For  ``the  Agency'',  as  it's  called,  to
succeed, an efficient and effective Public Service is required. This is  not
the case in South Africa.

The monthly grant for many is a lifeline that is  literally  the  difference
between life and death. We dare not put at any greater risk  than  they  are
already those people who are suffering.  People  need  to  know  that  their
money is going to come through every single month.

But, Minister, despite our objections, these amendments are, on  the  whole,
positive ones for the NDA, and the DA supports the Bill.

Mrs I MARS: Deputy Chairman, hon Minister,  the  IFP  is  pleased  that  the
amendments to the 1998 National Development Agency Bill are  finally  to  be
considered by this House. To us, the transfer of the NDA from  the  Treasury
to the Ministry of Social Development is a logical  decision  and  the  most
important aspect of the proposed changes to the Bill.

Regarding other changes, even the fact that the number  of  members  of  the
board has been reduced does not, in our opinion,  necessarily  detract  from
its potential effectiveness, although, ideally, we would  have  preferred  a
larger proportion of members from civil society.

The NDA's vision - and I  quote:  ``to  be  the  premier  partner  to  civil
society and Government  in  eradicating  poverty  in  South  Africa''  -  is
obviously a matter we all support. It is  a  vision  that,  when  translated
into effective implementation, could transform the  lives  of  many  of  our
most deserving fellow citizens.

Since its inception in  1998,  the  NDA  has  been  endowed  with  financial
resources  and  established  human  and  physical  infrastructure,  such  as
national and regional offices. It has also raised the expectations of  civil
society. I believe that we need  to  establish  clearly  what  these  public
expectations  are   and   test   existing   projects   for   viability   and
sustainability.

The NDA has provided us with impressive lists of  funded  projects,  and  we
trust  that  these  have   achieved   our   objectives   regarding   poverty
alleviation.

I have to state that it is extremely difficult for members of this House  to
locate projects from the information made available. In  future,  therefore,
we  will  rely  on  the  Ministry  of  Social  Development  to  supply  more
comprehensive information.

We also note from the 2001 report that the main beneficiaries -  that  means
the actual disbursements per province - are located in Gauteng, whereas  the
Republic's most densely  province,  KwaZulu-Natal,  received,  in  terms  of
disbursement, only half of that of Gauteng. These and other  concerns  will,
in due course, be addressed  through  the  good  offices  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Social Development.

In 2001 the corporate sector  was  left  with  an  unspent  balance  of  the
Government grant. We assume that there was a good reason for that  and  that
the funds have subsequently been utilised.

We also note that the interests of the European  Union's  funds  had  to  be
returned in terms of the agreements. One cannot help but wonder how  funding
was applied for and approved, and what the reasons were  for  nonutilisation
of these funds.

What did, however, impress us was the fact that as far as operational  costs
are concerned, the  prudent  investment  of  R1 million  received  from  the
Independent Development Trust yielded sufficient interest to offset a  large
portion of the operational expenditure. To us  this  demonstrates  that  the
board has set up a sound fiscal framework.

In closing, I wish to take this opportunity to wish  the  NDA  a  successful
future under the Ministry of Social Development. We are looking  forward  to
a good working relationship. We also want to encourage the Minister and  the
portfolio committee to take an active interest in the NDA's  programmes  and
projects. Much is expected from all of us, and we have to ensure that  every
available cent is used to support and  empower  our  most  deserving  fellow
citizens.

The IFP supports this Bill. Thank you.

Mr A Z A VAN JAARSVELD: Deputy Chair, in our quest to make  South  Africa  a
better place for all its people, we can never stop looking for  measures  to
improve the systems and processes through  which  we  want  to  attain  this
goal.

In ons soeke na beter dienslewering en praktiese metodes om die  grense  van
armoede terug te skuif doen ons daagliks meer ondervinding op  en  gaan  ons
noodwendig leemtes in sisteme ontdek. Dit is ons taak om  toe  te  sien  dat
hierdie  leemtes  aangevul  word   en   die   implementeringsprosesse   meer
vaartbelyn gemaak word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In our quest for better service delivery  and  practical  methods  to  push
back the frontiers of poverty we  are  gaining  experience  daily  and  will
necessarily detect deficiencies in systems. It is our  task  to  see  to  it
that  these  deficiencies  are  supplemented  and  that  the  implementation
processes are made more streamlined.]

The primary object of the NDA is to contribute towards  the  eradication  of
poverty and its causes by granting funds to civil society organisations  for
the purposes of carrying out projects or programmes  aimed  at  meeting  the
development  needs  of   poor   communities   and   at   strengthening   the
institutional capacity of other  civil  society  organisations  involved  in
direct service provision to poor communities.

The NDA should act as  a  key  conduit  for  funding  from  our  Government,
foreign  governments  and  other  national  and  international  donors   for
development work to be carried out by civil society organisations.  It  must
also  contribute  towards   building   the   capacity   of   civil   society
organisations to enable them to carry out development work effectively.

Last year  the  NDA  tabled  a  document  entitled  ``Grant  commitment  and
disbursement report''.

In hierdie  dokument  is  die  indruk  geskep  dat  meer  as  84%  van  alle
maatskaplike toelae wat vir die boekjaar 2001-02 aan welsynsorganisasies  en
maatskaplike instansies toegeken is,  nié  deur  die  ontwikkelingsagentskap
versprei is nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

In this document the impression was  created  that  more  than  84%  of  all
social grants allocated to welfare  organisations  and  social  institutions
for the 2001-02 financial year  were  not  distributed  by  the  development
agency.]

I took up this issue of underspending with the Minister in a  question,  and
he replied as follows:


  Funds received by the agency amounted to R238 328 570, which consists  of
  Government grants amounting to  R190  million  and  the  grant  from  the
  European Union amounting to R48 328 570. Of  the  R190  million  received
  from the Government, an amount of R126 771 620, or 67%, was allocated  to
  various projects. This amount represents disbursements of R49 493 375, or
  26%, and committed funds of R77 million rounded off, almost 41%, for  the
  financial year.


  Secondly, I would like to remind the hon member that during the financial
  year under review, my Ministry and the  department  had  no  jurisdiction
  over the National Development Agency. The responsibility of the  NDA  was
  transferred from the Ministry of Finance to that of Social Development by
  the presidential proclamation on 19 October 2001. I have met with the NDA
  board who has assured me that they are  taking  all  necessary  steps  to
  expedite project approvals and payments.

By changing the composition of the board and making the proposed changes  in
the Bill, we are definitely going one step further in our  quest  to  attain
our goal of pushing back the frontiers of poverty, and for that we, the  New
NP, support this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Prof L M MBADI: Chairperson, ``Rhecizulu''  [Tallman]  and  colleagues,  the
Bill before us amends  the  National  Development  Agency  Act  of  1998  by
transferring responsibility for the NDA from the Ministry of Finance to  the
Ministry of Social Development. The NDA is now  the  responsibility  of  the
Minister of Social Development.

What is of great significance in the Bill is the reduction in the number  of
members of the board. The NDA acts through a board whose number  of  members
has now been reduced as follows: the  six  members  representing  Government
have been reduced to five; and the nine members representing  civil  society
have been reduced to six.

The reduction in the number of members representing civil society from  nine
to six is of great concern to the UDM. These members are too few to  reflect
South African society, with special attention to race, gender,  geographical
spread, organisations based in rural areas and faith-based organisations.

We also have to bear in mind that the  primary  object  of  the  NDA  is  to
contribute towards the eradication of poverty and  its  causes  by  granting
funds to civil organisations for the purpose of  carrying  out  projects  or
programmes aimed at meeting the development needs of poor communities.

The UDM would have appreciated the following reduction: that the  number  of
members representing Government be reduced from six to four; and the  number
of members representing civil society be reduced from  nine  to  seven.  The
total number of members of the board would remain 11. The only change  would
be the strengthening of civil society by one member.

It must be noted that it is the Minister, not the members of the board,  who
must appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson from the members of  the
board. However, it is the  members  of  the  board  that  recommend  to  the
Minister the appointment of a chief executive officer of the NDA.

The UDM supports the Bill.

Mrs R M SOUTHGATE: Deputy Chair ...  [Interjections.]  I'm  so  glad  I  got
members' attention.  [Interjections.]  However,  one  minute  is  still  not
sufficient, but I want to do justice to my speech. [Interjections.]

The revised composition of the NDA board from 15 to 11 will give  Government
greater influence over the policy direction  of  this  agency.  And,  as  we
know, there's going to be manipulation.

It is evident that civil society organisations are being  marginalised  from
mainstream socioeconomic  projects  and  programmes.  The  ACDP  has  always
maintained  that  social  policies   are   the   central   role   of   civic
organisations. We do not support the way the  executive  and  administrative
functions of the board have been downscaled.

It is unacceptable practice that the  Minister  appoint  a  chair  or  chief
executive officer when  the  board  can  reasonably  execute  this  function
itself. The board's  purpose  and  vision  will  diminish  with  respect  to
Government's interference. And, may I  add,  putting  this  particular  body
under the sole administration of Social Development is not right. It is  not
good, because poverty reduction should be  the  responsibility  of  all  the
other Ministries involved in this.  [Interjections.]  It  is  not  just  the
responsibility of Social Development, so I have a great  problem  with  this
aspect as well.

The ACDP does  not  support  this  amendment.  Thank  you.  [Interjections.]
[Applause.]

Dr M S MOGOBA: Chairperson, the PAC  supports  the  amendments.  We  believe
that the change of jurisdiction from Finance  to  Social  Development  is  a
very good move, because when you deal  with  development,  you  are  dealing
with Social Development. I happen to have a  longish  association  with  the
NDA from the IDT days through the transitional Development Agency up to  the
creation of the NDA. And I know how the whole  question  was  being  debated
from one point to another.

I just want to  say  that  development  will  not  happen  unless  there  is
credibility and confidence, and  people  begin  to  realise  that  they  are
participants in the whole process of development. I believe that the NDA  is
one of the assets that we have in this country.  We  must  develop  it  very
carefully and nurture it because basically, in the  end,  no  government  or
party can bring about development, but an independent body like the NDA  can
be a useful vehicle in bringing about development in the areas in  which  it
is needed.

I want to say ``Halala, NDA. Grow from strength to strength. We need you.''

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. The MF wishes to  voice  its
support of the National Development  Agency.  There  is  a  great  need  for
Government and civil society  to  work  closely  together  to  reassure  the
public that Government  is  here  to  deliver  and,  in  turn,  this  should
encourage Government to ensure that it is delivering satisfactorily.

Poverty is one of the worst diseases eating away at South  African  society.
To alleviate this, Government is working around the  clock  in  all  spheres
and sectors to ensure delivery and to eradicate the problem.

One such attempt has been that the NDA has been set  up  as  an  independent
statutory body. The NDA has been set up for the funding of development  work
by civil society organisations by  the  South  African  Government,  foreign
governments and other international donors.

The MF supports the provisions made in this amending Bill.  However,  it  is
felt that the NDA should play a vital  role  in  facilitating  the  work  of
civil society organisations by acting both as a  source  of  funding  and  a
source of capacity-building. Further, the  success  of  the  NDA  should  be
measured by its ability to activate  civil  society  projects  to  eradicate
poverty and improve economic sustainability.

The MF supports the National Development Agency Amendment Bill.

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Thank you, Mr Chairman. I  hereby  thank
all members for their contribution and I would like to assure them that  the
NDA will do exactly what it ought to be doing and what it  has  been  doing,
that is, ensuring that development reaches almost everybody in the whole  of
South Africa, specifically the poorest of the poor, and goes out  to  almost
each and every region of each and  every  province  of  this  country,  with
special emphasis on those four provinces that have been prioritised  by  the
Government: the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, and  the  Free  State,
as well as all the others.

We would like to focus basically, both as a department and as  the  NDA,  on
the rural areas, as I have mentioned  and,  more  importantly,  on  ensuring
that women take the lead in development. [Applause.]

Last, but not least, we would like to appeal  to  all  parties  to  support,
work and co-operate with the NDA. The NDA will never be able to do its  work
unless it has your support, monitoring, help, assistance  and  direction  so
that it can reach the poorest of the  poor  with  special  emphasis  on  the
rural areas and also the poorest of the poor in the urban areas. And I  hope
that, with this Bill, we will be able to  ensure  that  there  is  always  a
quorum in the board so that we do not have a big board that  sometimes  does
not correlate, and that is why we have to cut the composition of  the  board
down to what it is.

In so far as the question of the participation of the other  departments  is
concerned, quite obviously, out of the five people that ought to  be  there,
one would be  from  Social  Development,  and  others  will  come  from  the
departments that have always worked with the NDA. I do not see any need  for
concern to be expressed on that issue. Development  is  not  a  departmental
issue.  It  is  an  all-round  issue  in  which  every   department   should
participate.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time (African Christian Democratic Party dissenting).

The House adjourned at 17:11.
