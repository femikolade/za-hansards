                                    ____

              PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                                    ____

The Council met at 14:04.

The Chairperson took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Hon members, I was commenting that it  is  most
unusual that hon members convene in a quorum so quickly after the  bells.  I
believe, hon Minister, it is out of respect for your presence  that  we  saw
such a response.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Mr K D S DURR: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at  the  next  sitting
of this Council I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)   the  HIV/Aids  pandemic  is  South  Africa's  worst  crisis  as
           Government has no adequate treatment plan;


       (b)  the Government's flawed  policies  to  fight  the  disease  have
           contributed to the erosion of the socioeconomic stability of the
           nation; and


       (c)  Government policy decisions have given rise to scandals such  as
           -


           (i)   Sarafina;


           (ii)  the Virodene embarrassment; and


           (iii)  an  international  HIV/Aids  summit  held  in  Durban  to
                  ascertain whether HIV leads to Aids, elevating  the  views
                  of  dissidents  as  infallible  and   refusing   to   make
                  antiretroviral     drugs     available     and     thereby
                  procrastinating in taking action regarding the  prevention
                  of mother-to-child transmission and the treatment of  rape
                  victims;


  (2) therefore calls on Government to -


       (a)  review its HIV/Aids policy in the light of the current  12%,  an
           estimated 5  million  people,  of  South  Africans  living  with
           HIV/Aids, estimated to increase to 17% in 2006 and  between  600
           and 1 600 people estimated to be  dying  daily  of  Aids-related
           illnesses;


       (b)  speedily implement the provision of antiretroviral treatment  to
           Aids patients;
       (c)  form partnerships with NGOs and CBOs utilising  their  expertise
           and proven track record in working with HIV/Aids patients;


       (d)   fund  NGO  training  programmes,  that  already  have  adequate
           infrastructure and personnel, to  train  our  nurses  and  other
           health workers to effectively treat Aids patients;


       (e)  improve relations with health workers and  to  listen  to  their
           remonstrations on the whole question of Aids treatment; and


       (f)  declare a health state of emergency with  notification,  tracing
           and compulsory testing going hand in  hand  with  antiretroviral
           treatment.

Mr N M RAJU: Chairperson, I hereby give notice that at the next  sitting  of
the House I shall move:


  That the Council -
  (1) takes note of comments attributed to Mr Thami  Mazwai,  where  he  is
       alleged to have said in  a  briefing  to  a  parliamentary  portfolio
       committee meeting: ``I feel  that  objectivity  is  a  delusion.  The
       notion known as objectivity does not exist.'';


  (2) expresses its concern that the comments made by  Mr  Mazwai,  in  his
       capacity as SABC News Programming Chairman, are disturbing and  shows
       another attempt to muzzle the press, or get the Fourth Estate to be a
       lackey of the state;


  (3) is of the view that one-sided, unbalanced  reporting,  or  worse,  to
       impede editorial independence and media freedom, is  the  last  thing
       needed in the new democratic South Africa, where freedom of the press
       is one of the cornerstones of democracy.

                          BRUTAL VIOLATION OF MINOR

                             (Draft Resolution)
Ms M P THEMBA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) condemns in strongest terms the brutal violation of an eight-year-old
       girl who was lured to a nearby house while playing in the streets  of
       KwaThema in the East Rand;


  (2) notes that this is the latest in a series of sexual attacks on minors
       in the area;


  (3) further notes that she was lured by a  man  in  his  early  40s,  old
       enough to be the child's father; and


  (4) calls upon the community of the East Rand and nearby areas to  assist
       the police in apprehending the  suspect  so  that  if  convicted,  he
       should rot in jail where he belongs.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       Murray van der Aardweg;


  (2) congratulates four primary schools at Mahlabathini district  and  one
       high school at  Nkandla  district  for  having  benefited  from  this

  (3) hopes that these acquired resources will be utilised to  the  benefit
       of teaching and learning, thus  equipping  our  nation  with  learned
       human resources; and


  (4) appeals to the Department of  Education  to  improve  the  supply  of
       learning resources to all schools, be they urban or rural.

[Ms E C GOUWS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council notes that -


  (1) the South African Navy's third corvette,  F147,  was  named  the  SAS
       Spioenkop during a ceremony at the Blohm-Voss shipyard in Germany;


  (2) the ship was named after the famous battle during the Anglo-Boer  War
       in which a small group of Boers  was  involved  in  a  bloody  battle
       against a British superior power and won;


  (3) the Spioenkop will take to the water next month;


  (4) the other two corvettes, SAS Amatola and SAS Isandlwana, are  already

       meeting in resolving the Middle East crisis;


  (2) notes that this was an important step towards achieving peace in  the
       Middle East;


  (3) further notes that Prime Ministers Sharon and  Abbas  have  committed

       themselves to the "road map" peace plan;


  (5) further believes that it is through negotiations that  peace  can  be
       achieved; and


  (6) therefore calls upon the Israeli and  Palestinian  citizens  to  give
       these negotiations a chance as  a  means  of  achieving  long-lasting
       peace in the region.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

  That the Council -


  (1)  welcomes  the  speedy  arrest  and  successful  conviction  of  four
       teenagers and a  20-year-old  that  attacked  and  robbed  two  women

                  AFRICAN COLLECTIVE AT THE EVIAN G8 SUMMIT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and congratulates  achievements  by  the  Presidents  of  South
       Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Senegal as collective at  the  Evian  G8

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that as at 9 May 2003 there were still  47  countries  who
       had not yet signed the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use,
       Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines  and  on
       their Destruction, known as the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which  to  date
       has  been  signed  by  147  signatories  or   accessories   and   134
       ratifications or accessions of or approvals; and
  (2) calls on all the countries which have as yet not signed this Mine Ban
       Treaty to consider doing so, as soon as possible.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                             (Review of policy)

Vote No 6 - Public Works:

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Madam Chairperson and  hon  members,  in  this
House my approach to the budget will be more in the  form  of  reporting  on
some of the things that we have  done  for  particular  departments  in  the
provinces so that people will know what it is  that  we  are  doing  because
there is always a debate about what our responsibilities are.

While it is the delivery of services to our people that has turned the  tide
in our country, let us discuss what it is that the  national  Department  of
Public Works contributes in particular in ensuring that South Africa  has  a
built environment sufficient to the needs of the state.

Under the Capital Works Programme, ten years ago, the Fixed Asset  Portfolio
of the state was regarded as nothing but bricks  and  mortar  to  house  the
machinery of the  state  in  some  of  its  heinous  activities.  Today  our
Government has added a human face to this function.

Our Capital Works portfolio has inherent socioeconomic  opportunities  which
include, first, the provision of  conducive  physical  space  out  of  which
other government departments can work. Second, there  is  the  promotion  of
black economic empowerment particularly in  the  property  and  construction
industries, which are the direct and main  beneficiaries  of  Public  Works'
capital works investment.

Third, we have the stimulation of the construction and  building  industries
as catalysts of  the  Reconstruction  and  Development  Programme  including
infrastructure development, job creation and human resource  development  as
enshrined in the President's vision of the Expanded Public Works Programme.

For the second consecutive year, the national  Department  of  Public  Works
has succeeded in spending almost 100% of its Capital Works budget,  as  well
as the R557 million of its maintenance budget.

In 2003-04, the national Department of Public Works, providing and  managing
accommodation for the state, will operate a Capital Works  budget  totalling
R1,9  million.  This  includes  the  entire  building  programme  that   the
department manages. A breakdown per province  of  the  budget  is:  Gauteng,
R690 million; Western  Cape,  R368  million;  KwaZulu-Natal,  R217  million;
Eastern Cape, R212 million; Free  State,  R143  million;  North  West,  R127
million; Mpumalanga, R58 million; Northern Cape, R57 million,  and  Limpopo,
R36 million.

I want to explain that in some of this budget  it  will  appear  as  if  the
amounts are small. It is just that some of the work was  done  the  previous
year. We must also remember that Gauteng and the Western Cape are  the  ones
who deal with prestige accommodation for  the  Presidency,  the  Ministerial
complexes, Parliament and the Union Buildings.

With  an  allocation  of  R900  million  in  2003-04,  the   Department   of
Correctional Services is the largest investor with the Department of  Public
Works for the improvement of physical accommodation. Other  departments  are
Justice and Constitutional Development with R229 million;  SAPS  with  R208;
and Arts and Culture with R145 million. Those are just the top four.

In line with the Government's strategy  to  prioritise  security  and  crime
prevention, projects for the Department of Correctional Services,  SAPS  and
the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development  assume  a  special
importance.

Executing the commissions on behalf of our client departments, we  highlight
some of the projects. In the Department of Correctional  Services,  a  major
step in the development  of  prisons  in  South  Africa  today  is  the  New
Generations Prison Initiative. Together with the Department of  Correctional
Services, my department is involved in the  design  of  a  prototype  prison
which would result in the converging of all prison demands in  a  functional
and efficient facility to produce cost-effective operation and  maintenance,
without  neglecting  the  legal  and  social  objectives  necessary   in   a
correctional facility.

Innovative developments include reduced numbers of inmates in  a  unit  that
is individually  managed  and  controlled  as  opposed  to  the  traditional
system. The prototype will also bring, through its  procurement  facilities,
support of black economic empowerment, as projects  will  be  packaged  into
smaller contracts. This is  expected  to  be  rolled  out  throughout  South
Africa. At the start there will be four initial projects which  are  already
out on tender for Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Nigel and Leeuwkop.

As a strategy to reverse the maintenance backlog on  our  fixed  properties,
we started the Repair and Maintenance Programme,  Ramp,  about  three  years
ago. Correctional Services was among our initial  clients  for  Ramp.  Today
all prisons in South Africa  are  under  varying  stages  of  Ramp  and  the
programme represents a major component of Capital Works.

Prisons at Kirkwood, Port Elizabeth, Mdantsane, Middelburg  and  Middledrift
are some of the facilities where Ramp is being implemented as  part  of  the
R83 million used  by  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services  in  their
budget, that is, for the Eastern  Cape.  In  Mpumalanga,  we  are  currently
progressing  at  Barberton,  Witbank  and  Bethal  out  of  a  R47   million
Correctional Services investment.

In KwaZulu-Natal, besides Ramp projects, my  department  has  finalised  and
handed over a R58 million housing project at the Empangeni Prison  where  84
single quarters  and  178  houses  were  constructed  for  the  Correctional
Services personnel. Major renovations and upgradings are continuing  at  the
Durban-Westville Prison as part of our R141  million  Capital  Works  budget
for KwaZulu-Natal.

When we come to the SAPS, who are our latest entrants to join Ramp,  in  the
Free State, projects worth R30 million are being executed  for  them.  These
include the construction of proposed police stations  at  Thabong,  Namahadi
and Batho near Bloemfontein.

Almost every province has acquired a community  safety  centre  as  part  of
Government's integrated approach to fighting crime and creating a  safe  and
secure environment. Most of these safety centres were built and handed  over
to the Department of Safety and  Security  as  the  lead  department.  These
include Thembalethu, Khutsong, Leboeng, and Tshidilamolomo.

The construction of the R28 million Galeshewe Community Safety  Centre  near
Kimberley is progressing very well, and we are expecting the  centre  to  be
operational in early 2004. At Kentani in the Eastern Cape, we have a  centre
that is finished and is awaiting official  opening.  In  the  Western  Cape,
Limpopo, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal,  we  also  have  similar  centres.  A
community safety centre near Welkom in the Free State is under planning.

At Namahadi we are spending R27 million  and  in  Batho  R12,4  million  for
police stations, as well as R10,5 million for a police station at Tsolo.  We
know  the   history   of   Tsolo.   Major   upgradings   are   underway   at
Pietermaritzburg's old Magistrate's Court at a cost of R6,8 million  and  at
the Pietermaritzburg Colonial  Building  at  a  cost  of  R14,4  million  in
KwaZulu-Natal. The Cinderella Prison is still a problem.

My department has focused  special  attention  on  addressing  the  dolomite
problems in Defence-occupied areas in Thaba Tshwane with  special  reference
to the Waterkloof Airforce Base. This project has currently been rolled  out
to cover the rest of the affected area. The emphasis  is  on  activating  an
early warning system, monitoring and remedial actions.

Furthermore  a  new  communication  tower  is  being  constructed   at   the
Waterkloof Airforce Base. A major repair programme is underway  at  the  dry
dock in Simons Town where the new Navy headquarters that  are  currently  in
the design  phase  will  also  be  situated.  Additional  accommodation  and
renovation work are underway at the Hoedspruit and Louis Trichardt  Airforce
Bases respectively in the Limpopo.

The Department of Arts and Culture commissioned us to expend  R54,8  million
on museums and other projects in 2002-03. The  Department  of  Environmental
Affairs  and  Tourism  has  a  new  facility  for  weather  observation  and
scientific research on Marion Island to the value of  R117  million  over  a
period of three years and this is actually  being  planned  to  replace  the
existing deteriorated infrastructure.

The Ramp initiative has also been applied to upgrade fishing  harbours,  and
I am sure that the people in the  Western  Cape  will  smile,  in  order  to
provide  vital  support  to  the  fishing  industry  in  the  Western  Cape.
Currently 15 constructors have been appointed at  eight  harbours.  This  is
for a contract value of R85 million, opening up 900 new  job  opportunities.
On schedule for the end of 2004, we are looking at 27 contracts  at  all  12
fishing harbours with  a  contract  value  of  R161,5  million  and  we  are
expecting the opening up of 1 700 job opportunities.

When we talk of the Expanded Public  Works  Programme  -  this  follows  the
announcement by the President in February - it  has  the  department  taking
concrete steps to ensure that the concept of an  EPWP  is  fully  understood
and supported within and outside of Government. Though co-ordinated  by  the
Department of Public Works, this is a national effort which  will  mean  the
participation of Government, business, unions and civil society in general.

Part of our challenge is to ensure that objectives of the EPWP are  properly
understood, these being job creation,  poverty  alleviation,  investment  in
social and economic infrastructure, and human resource  development  through
the training of participants.

The key focus areas where the Department of Public Works is  in  a  position
to optimise contributions are  through  the  use  of  labour-based  methods,
emerging contractor support programmes and a procurement  policy  that  will
ensure responsiveness, uniformity and adjustment throughout all  spheres  of
government, and monitoring and evaluation  to  ensure  mechanisms  to  track
developments focused on objectives and targets.

Then we have the Community-Based Public Works Programmes. Since  1999  until
the end of 2003, we achieved a total of 2 517 rural infrastructure  projects
with 106 000 job opportunities created. A total of 39 125  jobs  were  taken
up by women, 47 323 by the youth, and 2 249 by people with disabilities.  We
managed to create 3 273 sustainable jobs.

The community production centres and the 37 operational MPCCs  have  made  a
big difference to the lives of our  people.  They  are  really  turning  the
tide. Wherever you go in South  Africa,  everyone  says  that  they  want  a
multipurpose community centre.

When we started with the concept of the  CPCs,  we  were  moving  away  from
dealing with community gardens all over South Africa, and we felt  that  the
infrastructure which was lying  neglected  and  had  been  in  some  of  the
homelands needed, for the good of the people, to be revitalised.

We started at the Lambasi CPC which is producing an average  of  2 500  tons
of maize per year in an area of 500 hectares. The mealie sales that we  have
had, on average of 1 300 tons, have  realised,  just  for  this  year,  R2,6
million. As a byproduct, they are breeding chickens, and  80  000  of  those
were sold in the past financial year and they have  realised  R1,3  million.
This is money that eventually deals with the needs of the communities.

At Ncora which in its days of glory was said to be the biggest  in  Southern
Africa and which, together with  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Land
Affairs we are trying to activate, we are selling cabbages from 10  hectares
and, over a period of a month, the sales that have been paid for  amount  up
to R40 000. The seedlings  for  cabbages  were  produced  in  a  nursery  by
locals. A group of women who have technical support  from  the  Agricultural
Research Council is experimenting in the production of herbs.

At the Highlands CPC, 640 hectares have been fenced and a 100 of these  have
been put under maize. Partnership with the Department of Agriculture's  Mass
Food Production will consolidate  and  extend  the  benefits  to  about  400
households. With 10 hectares under cabbage, about R20 000 from  one  hectare
has already been realised.

At Keiskammahoek the people entered into a private partnership with  Clover.
We have improved the irrigation infrastructure and  because  of  that,  they
are already managing to milk 51 cows, and the Land Bank  has  promised  them
money for buying more dairy cows. At the Elandskraal CPC, the  community  is
benefiting  from  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  infrastructure  while
approximately 290 small farmers are engaged  in  reaping  the  winter  wheat
crops for subsistence consumption and local markets. In upper Arabie,  still
in Limpopo, we have an area that covers approximately 540  hectares  and  is
supporting about 400  small-scale  farmers.  We  have  built  an  irrigation
system with rehabilitated and new irrigation infrastructure there.

Then, regarding Mpumalanga, there is an interesting product there.  We  call
this  the  Cairn  Lemon  CPC.  The  community   is   benefiting   from   the
rehabilitation of the bulk water supply, the development of a lemon  orchard
and the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure. This CPC has a  secured
market with Coca Cola which is their primary market.

In KwaZulu-Natal, we have 18 local women  and  five  men  farming  about  18
hectares, and these people are  growing  various  crops  and  have  an  easy
market not only in the form of the local hawkers, but also the town  market.
Other facilities that  have  been  created  are  a  packing  house,  storage
facilities, toilets, a crèche and a road in  order  to  reach  the  markets.
Profits are shared between members, and dividends are based on the  member's
contribution to the crop production.

At the Makhathini Flats in KwaZulu-Natal, the  Department  of  Public  Works
has completed the infrastructure provision.  The  provincial  department  of
agriculture is busy with production and development though  there  are  some
land claims around  this  particular  matter.  In  Schmidtsdrift,  you  will
remember that the people were given back their land  and  we  now  have  770
households who farm with goats and sheep.

The provision of fencing and the rehabilitation of  the  water  supply  will
enable them to graduate from subsistence to a commercial level  of  farming.
At Qwaqwa, we did have some problems which led  to  the  withdrawal  of  the
money, but the IDT and we are not giving up. We will go back there with  the
help, I want to believe, of the two MECs concerned.

I would like to invite the provinces to identify and suggest tracts of  land
that could be suitable for community production centres. Many  people  stand
to benefit and  we  can  together  fight  the  battle  against  poverty,  in
particular through  food  production.  The  partnership  we  have  with  the
Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs is sure to pay dividends.  Indeed
we are proud because these are not dreams, but  results  that  are  concrete
and visible among communities.

In an effort to  keep  the  projects  sustainable,  an  allocation  of  R6,5
million aimed at revitalisation was  given  to  municipalities.  Mostly  the
youth will be working on these projects and  we  hope  that  we  shall  have
positive results which will lead to a situation  where  we  no  longer  have
white elephants.

In the construction  industry,  the  Department  of  Public  Works  will  be
initiating a  process  of  transformation  via  a  framework  this  year  in
partnership with other infrastructure departments and the private sector.

This  will  culminate  in  a  transformation   charter.   To   promote   the
construction industry as an asset  of  the  country  and  to  attract  young
students into the industry, the department will be  driving  a  campaign  to
establish a construction industry development week.

Another initiative will be the incubator programme. The  objective  of  this
programme is to provide sustainable work opportunities, training and  access
to finance to black construction enterprises of significant size to  develop
them to the status of established construction enterprises. Projects  valued
at between a minimum of R2 million up to a threshold of R25 million will  be
identified exclusively for these enterprises over a period of time.

Coming to our budget for the  financial  year  2003-04,  the  Department  of
Public Works is presenting a budget of  R4,47  billion.  The  provision  for
land and accommodation accounts for 86%  of  the  budget  and  the  national
Public Works Programme for 7%, thus leaving  7%  of  our  total  budget  for
administration and other auxiliary and associated services.

During the current fiscal year, the  department  will  also  facilitate  the
planned gradual devolution of budgetary allocations to  client  departments,
starting with the devolution of rates and taxes  in  respect  of  provincial
properties to the provinces, in  the  next  financial  year.  This  will  be
followed by other operational budgets in subsequent years.

In line with this arrangement, an amount  of  R576  million  for  rates  and
taxes applicable to provincial governments shall be  devolved  to  them  for
purposes of payment and administration with effect from the  next  financial
year.

The amounts to be devolved categorised per province are: Eastern  Cape,  R35
million; Free State, R72 million - I am sure my friend is smiling;  Gauteng,
R180 million; KwaZulu-Natal, R97 million; Limpopo, R6  million;  Mpumalanga,
R15 million; North West, R73 million; Northern Cape, R13  million;  and  the
Western Cape with R85 million. The capacitation of provinces in  respect  of
the new administration responsibilities will be carried out  in  the  course
of this year.

We have not, in whatever it is that we are doing, forgotten that  there  are
women out there. We are proud that in the construction industry we have  set
aside moneys which make us proud in making sure  that  we  have  an  up-and-
coming group of women in the construction industry  who  have  succeeded  in
doing and presenting and making sure that  their  work  is  invaluable,  who
have not left projects incomplete.

In conclusion, I wish to thank all members and in particular MECs for  their
continued dedication and support and  the  way  in  which  we  are  able  to
interact. I want to assure you  that  your  efforts  and  input  enrich  our
planning and implementation.

I would also like to thank the IDT for its ... [Inaudible.] It  is  not  the
path for it to be the implementing agent for so many departments, but it  is
trying its level best, and we really want to make sure that we give  it  all
the support it requires. [Applause.]

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Madam Chairperson, the hon Minister and  Deputy  Minister
of Public Works, hon members and special delegates, since 1994, our  ANC-led
Government has initiated various  programmes  that  are  at  the  centre  of
poverty eradication. Accordingly the Department of Public Works  has  become
one of the torchbearers in our endeavours to  push  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty.

Given its unique position as a catalyst for job creation, it has  made  huge
strides in responding to the  challenges  of  poverty  brought  to  bear  on
especially rural communities by lack  of  infrastructure  such  as  clinics,
police stations, justice centres, schools and many more. It is against  this
background that the twin challenges  of  the  Urban  Renewal  Programme  and
Integrated  Sustainable  Rural  Development  Strategy  were  put  to  us  by
President Mbeki in his state of the nation address in 2001.

In terms of the President's injunction, 13 nodes were  identified.  For  the
National Council of Provinces, the implementation of  anchor  projects  that
would sustain development and progress in these nodes  is  central  to  both
programmes. The programmes also represent a governmental effort  to  redress
the legacies of the past, and to place these areas on  a  new  developmental
trajectory.  In  order  to  achieve  this   fundamental   break   from   the
perpetuating  poverty  and  underdevelopment,  the  criteria   for   project
identification and support is central. Government's  aim  is  to  bring  all
three spheres of government  together,  in  a  co-ordinated  and  integrated
manner.

It is envisaged that development of the nodes will  depend  on  inter  alia,
economic and social infrastructure, human resource  development,  enterprise
development and  the  enhancement  of  the  development  capacity  of  local
government. We believe that the Department of Public Works is  committed  to
the realisation of this vision,  and  that  its  programmes  are,  in  fact,
aligned  with  and  informed  by  the  continued  persistence   of   massive
socioeconomic infrastructure in spatial imbalances. As  a  consequence,  the
department has adopted new policy frameworks to  accelerate  infrastructural
development as a conduit for sustainable job creation.

The ANC believes that the fundamentals are in place and  that  the  approach
of ensuring citizens participate in activities  that  seek  to  develop  and
shape their communities is the correct one. As a  point  of  departure,  the
department established a national  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme
with  a  bias  towards  infrastructure  creation.  These  programmmes   have
delivered tangible benefits and job opportunities in South Africa's  poorest
provinces, notably Eastern Cape, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and  the
North West. Moreover the social impact of the programme has  positioned  the
CBPWP programme as an integral part  of  the  Integrated  Sustainable  Rural
Development Programme of Government, and  the  largest  beneficiary  of  the
Poverty Relief Fund.

It is in that context that, in 1997, the International  Labour  Organisation
judged the Community-Based Public Works Programme as being the best in  over
30  developing  countries.  What  is  significant  is  the  involvement   of
provincial and local government in the implementation of the  programme  and
the supportive role of traditional  leaders.  The  latter  often  make  land
available for infrastructure, although we must say  that,  in  other  areas,
there are problems which still need  to  be  resolved.  Directly  productive
assets such as bakeries, vegetable gardens, market  stalls  and  taxi  ranks
have contributed to bringing certain services and  economic  empowerment  to
some of our people.

In line with its mandate of accelerating the  realisation  of  socioeconomic
objectives of Government, CBPW manages a host of special projects. One  such
project is community production  centres.  These  are  communal,  commercial
centres for marketing and private sector  partnering,  often  utilising  and
adding value to the local factors  of  production  such  as  land.  The  hon
Minister has gone on at length to reflect on  the  achievements  which  have
been attained through these CPC programmes.

As stated by the President Thabo  Mbeki  during  the  state  of  the  nation
address on February 14 this year, further  improvement  in  the  quality  of
life of our people requires that  we  take  new  measures  to  increase  the
volume and the quality of our investment in the  social  infrastructure  and
improve our performance relative to the previous year. In  this  regard,  we
welcome the announcement by the President of South  Africa  with  regard  to
the allocation of additional resources to meet  this  obligation,  and  also
the launch of an Expanded Public Works Programme.

This applies similarly to the expansion of the network of  the  multipurpose
community centres because, during our provincial  visits,  communities  were
actually demanding these MPCCs which serve as one-stop centres -  where  the
poorer sections of our communities are actually being extended -  for  those
communities  where  they  were  not  yet  established.  According   to   the
Government Communications and Information System,  37  MPCCs  are  currently
operational and, according to their business plan, their intended  roll  out
is to have a total of 60 by the year 2005. We are  also  encouraged  by  the
phasing in of an electronic version of the  MPCCs  namely,  an  e-government
gateway.

We are aware that the department of Public Works has, over  the  past  year,
been engaged in extensive strategic planning with a view  to  enhancing  its
service client departments. To this end, it proposes a business  model  that
foresees that the department remains the owner and custodian  of  government
buildings and  estates  where  the  acquisition,  maintenance  and  disposal
function is on a business-like footing over time.

Accordingly the department will remain responsible  for  projects  involving
the acquisition, rehabilitation and  maintenance  of  state-owned  projects.
Presently, provinces may, in terms of section 104 of the Constitution,  pass
legislation  that  is  responsible  and  is  reasonably  necessary  for   or
incidental to the effective exercise of a power with regard to matters  that
have been assigned to that province. That is in relation to  the  properties
or fixed assets which belong to those provinces. To date,  eight  provinces,
with the exception of KwaZulu-Natal,  have  adopted  legislation  empowering
their premiers or designated MECs to  sell,  exchange,  donate  or  let  any
property or provincial state land he/she may deem  fit  to  appropriate.  In
terms of the relevant provincial legislation and financial regulations,  any
income derived from the disposal of  immovable  property  that  vests  in  a
province would accrue to that particular provincial revenue.

We must also commend and appreciate the work  the  department  is  doing  in
terms of women's empowerment. It has  introduced  a  Women  In  Construction
Programme, where  women-owned  business  enterprises  are  involved  in  the
renovation  or  rehabilitation  of  the  correctional  services  properties,
namely, our prisons. We have recently seen one of the  women-owned  business
enterprises being allocated and executing, with excellence, a  R179  million
tender  in  the  Limpopo  province;  and  many  more  other  women  business
enterprises are involved in such projects throughout the country.

I also want to say, in conclusion,  that  the  ANC  is  confident  that  the
significant internal restructuring  and  transformation  the  department  is
undergoing, is done with a view to ensuring it  has  capacity,  competencies
and skills to handle its strategic direction. It is in that  light  that  we
welcome this budget speech and we move that this Vote be passed. Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms G C BARRY (Eastern Cape): Thank you, Madam  Chair.  Chairperson  and  hon
members of the Council, it is a privilege to  be  given  an  opportunity  to
address this House on the Public Works Budget Vote.

As we know, the Eastern  Cape  is  one  of  the  provinces  which  has  huge
structural problems and underdevelopment, presenting enormous  socioeconomic
development challenges. These  include  very  high  levels  of  poverty  and
unemployment and huge disparities in  access  to  infrastructure  and  basic
services. Whilst  understanding  that  there  are  no  simple  or  quick-fix
solutions to these complex problems, our province and department  have  been
hard at work trying to  make  a  contribution  to  the  national  effort  of
changing the lives of the people of this country for the better.

In the past  few  years,  we  have  managed  to  increase  our  spending  on
infrastructure from a meagre two  per  cent  of  provincial  budget  to  the
current level of nine per cent.  As  a  result  of  these  efforts  and  the
contribution of the private sector, we have achieved real  GDP  growth  much
higher than the national average. Coming off a low base as  we  did,  we  do
realise that we need to redouble our efforts if we are to have the  kind  of
impact that is required.

With the funding that we have available, we  have  introduced  a  number  of
programmes and projects aimed at  fast-tracking  infrastructure  development
and alleviating poverty. These  include  labour-intensive  methods  in  road
maintenance and empowering emerging contractors. I must just  say  that,  in
the province, roads form part of this department's function. Our  department
has initiated a road maintenance programme where  households  in  identified
communities are afforded  an  opportunity  to  maintain  their  local  roads
themselves. In return, the department rewards  each  household  involved  in
the programme. Each household is given a  kilometre  of  road  to  maintain,
attending to it two days a month and in return receives a stipend of R400  a
month. This programme is called Vukuzakhe, which means ``stand up and do  it
for yourselves''. Vukuzakhe has two main strategic thrusts, namely,  poverty
alleviation and road maintenance. From a poverty alleviation point of  view,
the programme ensures that quite a sizeable number of households  have  some
measure of income every month thus  contributing  to  the  broader  economic
activity. From a road maintenance  perspective,  the  programme  assists  in
halting the rapid deterioration of gravel roads.

Vukuzakhe targets poor households  especially  woman-headed  households  and
has other social benefits which include the  following:  The  lengthmen  are
encouraged to establish saving clubs to which they contribute an  amount  of
R40 every month. The lengthmen are trained thus broadening the  skills  base
in each area. The programme instils a sense of pride and  ownership  in  the
communities. Lengthmen who  have  no  identity  documents  are  assisted  to
obtain these. The programme also restores human  dignity.  Parents  involved
in this programme are now accorded respect because they are able to  provide
for their families. Since its inception in September  2002,  this  programme
has  absorbed  about  1  900  households  who  are  maintaining  152   roads
throughout the province. In other words, 1  900  households  are  guaranteed
R400 every month. The programme started with a budget of R7 million  in  the
last financial year, and we have now doubled  it  to  R14  million  in  this
current financial year, so that we are able to  sustain  the  programme  and
also to extend it to absorb more households.

Regarding the construction industry,  in  making  a  contribution  to  black
economic empowerment, under this programme we have been engaged in a  number
of  initiatives.  These  include   the   emerging   contractor   development
programme. This  programme  commenced  with  the  registration  of  emerging
contractors into a common data bank. We then focused on training  programmes
for these contractors in a bid to help them to  become  better  contractors.
To date, we have trained 247 contractors of which  60  women  have  received
exclusive training on housebuilding. All  of  these  contractors  have  been
awarded certificates. However, they will now have to  go  through  the  SETA
recognition  of  prior  knowledge  programme  for  full  qualification.   In
providing  this  training,  we  have  been  partnering  with  SETA  and  the
Department of Labour.

Madam Chair, under our road construction programme, we  are  also  embarking
on looking  at  area-wide  maintenance  agreement  projects  which  will  be
established on community-based principles that are labour-intensive. We  are
also looking at similar projects when it comes to building maintenance.

The problem in the Eastern Cape is huge. The problem is also complex.  There
are no simple answers. However, with determination and commitment,  we  will
succeed. Our partnership,  therefore,  with  our  national  counterpart  and
national Government is key in tackling these challenges and I  am  happy  to
report that this partnership is alive and well.  With  these  few  words,  I
want to confirm the support of our province for  this  Vote.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr S M A MALEBO (Free State): Chairperson, hon members,  my  congratulations
go to the Minister on the presentation of a  comprehensive  budget.  I  rise
today in support of the budget. The  role  of  Public  Works  has  undergone
transformation like so many things in our lives today. Its role in the  past
was one of providing economically unsustainable jobs  that  had  more  of  a
negative impact on service delivery and on  the  fiscus.  This  was  because
Public Works had to provide employment, especially for  the  unskilled,  and
in most cases, less-than-productive people. Our problem  of  high  personnel
costs in comparison to that in the developmental budget  can  be  traced  to
this particular problem today.

However, today, Public Works' role is a significant one for a  developmental
state such as ours. Its role is to provide  physical  social  infrastructure
like hospitals, schools, clinics, halls,  theatres,  etc,  and  to  maintain
them. This  needs  to  be  done  in  the  context  of  enhancing  the  civil
construction industry and property markets. This department has a  key  role
in that, while providing the requisite infrastructure, it must provide  long
and short-term jobs. It must  have  intervention  measures  to  relieve  the
harsh effects of poverty while the  total  budget  is  aimed  at  the  total
eradication of poverty.

Public Works must enhance the construction industry and the property  market
in building an economy that creates jobs and growth. It  is  said  that  for
every R1 spent in this sector, it has an estimated ripple  effect  of  three
times further down in the economy. Only roads have a  better  ripple  effect
of one to six. After providing the  building,  civil  construction  has  the
potential of creating longer, sustainable jobs and  enhancing  the  property
market, as we have said.

Therefore, we need to  redouble  our  efforts  within  this  sector.  Better
spending  patterns  on  budget  allocation  has  meant  a  better   economic
performance by our province. This minimal growth  is  expected  to  continue
over the next four years, if spending involving the public and  the  private
sector continues in the same way.

A quick review of the year 2003 will be like this - very briefly:  Regarding
physical infrastructure, 20 social amenities to the  value  of  R37  million
were constructed, and they were completed in the same year.  These  included
hospitals, clinics and the renovation and  refurbishment  of  various  state
buildings. We were able to rebuild 14 schools. Eight new schools were  built
and 14 others received additional classrooms.

As far as the Letsema campaign is concerned,  this  campaign  was  conducted
successfully. The province provided  the  material  whilst  the  communities
provided labour. This has enabled us to design a  new  project  proposal  of
reducing the maintenance backlog by employing the same  experience  gathered
during  the  Letsema  campaign  at  various  schools  and   various   social
amenities.

Most of the construction work on the project that I  have  referred  to  was
done by black emerging contractors. In the new year, no  less  than  60%  of
all procurement, especially in construction, will be  set  aside  for  black
economic empowerment, with special emphasis on women contractors. Women  who
will be  targeted  are  those  who  have  undergone  training  in  the  last
financial year.

Job creation and provisioning remain a key challenge for all of us.  In  the
past  year,  for  each  construction  project,  there  was   a   contractual
obligation on the part of the contractor  not  only  to  employ  a  specific
number of locals,  but  a  percentage  was  set  aside  for  black  emerging
contractors for subcontracting and training.

It is in this context that our role as a job provider has  changed.  We  ask
for jobs that are sustainable and entail training for skills  upgrading.  In
this way, we are convinced that we are  on  the  road  to  the  creation  of
sustainable long-term jobs that reduce poverty and unemployment.

For the new financial year, we are expected now to do even more, and  do  it
with precision that will have an  impact  at  all  levels  of  our  society.
Briefly, these are the few of the projects that we have committed  ourselves
to. Firstly, on poverty alleviation, R10 million  has  been  set  aside  for
temporary jobs for rural areas  as  part  of  the  Extended  Community-Based
Public Works Programme. Secondly, it is estimated that construction  workers
will earn close to R100 million on wages in various projects  that  will  be
conducted in the  province.  Thirdly,  approximately  3  000  jobs  will  be
created from a number of projects that  we  will  be  pursuing.  The  fourth
point is that R160 million worth of construction projects  will  be  awarded
to black-owned construction companies and women-owned companies. Fifthly,  a
further R800 000 has been set  aside  for  further  training  on  tendering,
especially for the women and youth.

With regard to projects, education projects are meant  for  the  enhancement
of conducive conditions for learning and teaching. This year we  will  build
12 new schools and seven schools  will  receive  additional  classrooms.  In
terms of the Department of Health's projects that are meant for the  support
and conducive environment for the healthcare delivery system, we will  build
two  new  hospitals,  and  six  other  hospitals  will  be  refurbished  and
renovated, while seven clinics will be built in various districts.

As far as tourism is concerned, in order  to  support  that  sector  in  its
growth, five resorts that are owned by the province will be refurbished  and
others would be provided with new chalets. So, now you don't have  to  drive
fast through the Free State, because we are making some provision  for  you.
With regard to social development, the projects that we  will  be  attending
to to render care and rehabilitation will include a  monument  or  place  of
safety and various regional offices.

In conclusion, in order to support urban renewal, it has been  decided  that
all provincial departments and district offices must be accommodated in  the
CBD areas. This is on condition that the new building or the building to  be
acquired will have a face lift, and will  be  improved.  This  is  a  meagre
investment. We hope that it will attract big business back to the  old  CBD.
We hope that, in this way, our CBDs can be revived to become  real  economic
hubs  full  of  activities  and  services.  Ke  lebohile.  [I  thank   you.]
[Applause.]

Mr J THIBEDI (North West): Hon Chairperson and delegates,  I  also  rise  to
congratulate the Minister and support this budget debate on  behalf  of  the
North West province.

I  wish  to  indicate  that  in  terms  of  the  North  West  province,  our
maintenance and repair budget for the 2003-04 financial year stands  at  R20
627 million. This budget excludes the maintenance for education  and  health
facilities  whose  budgets  are  kept  by  those  client  departments.   Our
maintenance activities are divided into the following activities: These  are
renovations,  preventative  maintenance  and  emergency  maintenance.  Major
renovations exceeding R500 000 are planned and  documented  at  head  office
level. They are executed at regional level. The planning  is  done  at  head
office level.

Concerning the Expanded  Public  Works  Programme,  the  principle  of  this
programme is followed in the  execution  of  all  our  maintenance  projects
except for a few which require specialists. These  are  the  maintenance  of
electronic and sophisticated equipment such as  lifts,  boilers,  major  air
conditioning systems, cooling installations and so on. The  SMMEs  are  used
extensively for maintenance work requiring carpentry, bricklaying,  plumbing
and painting skills. Our construction  contracts  specify  that  contractors
must use local labour for all unskilled and semiskilled work.

Our main focus is on the use of labour-intensive technologies and  community
involvement, which we believe is crucial to  ensure  that  all  participants
receive on-the-job related training in the  construction  industry  and  are
certificated  after  each  and  every  aspect  of  training  that  has  been
completed. We are targeting the  youth,  women  and  the  disabled.  I  must
hasten to add that we have not  done  very  much  as  far  as  the  disabled
section of our population is concerned.

Our asset register for the province has been  finalised  and  is  available.
This is in electronic format and could thus easily be included in any  other
database. It is only through the help of such  an  asset  register  that  it
will be possible to devise a scientifically based  comprehensive  management
and maintenance strategy system which, we believe, will assist  us  a  great
deal, especially when we deal with matters of budgeting.

For our strategic objective as a department  for  2003-04  and  2005-06  the
following remain critical: providing professional and technical services  to
the two main client departments, which are health and education, as well  as
other departments; training staff in the application of the requirements  of
the  Preferential  Procurement  Policy  Framework   Act;   identifying   and
assessing risks  that  may  adversely  impact  on  the  capital  development
programme; working in consultation with  identified  financial  institutions
such as ABSA, Khula, ACFC,  Standard  Bank  and  FNB  to  provide  financial
support to emerging  contractors;  reviewing  Service  Level  Agreements  in
accordance with bi-lateral agreements between the  department  and  the  two
main clients  departments;  and  to  maintain  regular  contact  with  these
departments.

We believe that the Extended Public Works Programme is the  cornerstone  for
development and that it is imperative for  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty. Without it, there is little chance of success.

In terms  of  the  land  disposal  policy  strategy,  the  North  West  Land
Administration Act is in place and all policy is centred  around  this  Act.
The department is identifying and analysing  all  unused  and  underutilised
land. The following options for  disposal  have  been  identified:  offering
them to client departments for possible use; a transfer  to  a  district  or
local authority; renting to a third party; and selling in the  open  market.
This is in line with what the Minister said. By identifying this unused  and
underutilised  land,  we  will  be  able  to  secure  land   for   community
development centres.

In terms of  integrated  service  delivery,  we  are  seriously  working  on
mechanisms to integrate  our  work  as  a  department  with  that  of  local
municipalities, especially on integrating our budget on infrastructure  with
the IDPs. A number of meetings in this regard have been held with  a  number
of municipalities. Although the  focus  was  mainly  on  road  services,  we
believe that we are laying a foundation for integrated service  delivery  on
all fronts.

We have also identified our traditional leaders as  important  stakeholders.
We have a programme, which is supported  by  the  entire  executive  of  the
North West, to  build  offices  for  traditional  leaders  and  to  renovate
dilapidated offices for tribal offices. We have already opened  one  or  two
of those offices in one  of  our  villages.  Through  this  integration  and
working together, we will be able to realise the objective of  pushing  back
the frontiers of poverty.

To conclude, if one looks at the visible impact of  our  programme  and  the
school building programme,  this  covers  the  construction  of  59  schools
throughout  the  province  in  this  financial  year.  The  total  value  of
contracts awarded is R150 million. Out of this, R142 million  has  been  for
affirmable business enterprises and the remaining R8 million is  awarded  to
nonaffirmable business enterprises.

The  clinic  building  programme  covers  the  construction  of  69  clinics
throughout the province. In terms of planning, full documentation  has  been
completed. Out of this number, the invitation for  tenders  for  28  clinics
has been processed. This constitutes the first phase valued at R48  million.
I must quickly add that a total of  R30  million  of  this  phase  has  been
awarded to affirmable business enterprises. A further R4,2 million has  been
awarded to women. Furthermore, I must also indicate, in conclusion, that  we
held a very important summit for women in construction. Out of  that  summit
important resolutions were taken in terms on  how  we  should  take  forward
this process of involving women in construction.

Finally, we held a summit for all contractors - small, medium and  big  ones
- with consultants in the province to try to get a sense of  what  we  could
do in an integrated fashion to speed up the  process  of  service  delivery.
With those  few  words,  I  wish  to  say  that  we  support  the  Minister.
[Applause.]

Mr J S MABONA (Mpumalanga):  Madam  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  Deputy
Minister for Public Works, colleagues  from  the  different  provinces  here
today, and hon members, thank you  very  much  for  listening  to  my  small
speech of what it is we are doing in Mpumalanga. Normally, we  do  not  talk
too much about Mpumalanga, we work. [Laughter.] Normally!

When newspapers write negative things, we ignore them and work.  Because  we
know and believe that of those of our people who suffered, most of  them  do
not even read newspapers nor do they care about  what  is  said.  They  just
want to see what the Government that they voted  into  power  is  doing  for
them. Hence, in Mpumalanga, we go to communities each and every  two  weeks.
We call it an outreach programme. We really tell our people  the  truth.  If
you write lies, they look at you and say: ``No, that's fine.'' And  they  go
and vote for the party they think will deliver again.

I just want to be precise in my  speech.  The  public  works  department  in
Mpumalanga, with the small budget that it has, has three  categories.  Those
three categories are divided into further  categories.  These  are  property
holdings and asset management, and the other one is  public  works.  Another
one is the Community-Based Public Works Programme. I just  want  to  make  a
few references to what we are doing with regard to all these categories.

Regarding  property  holdings  and   asset   management,   verification   of
government properties progressed very  well  in  our  government  buildings.
Government employees are also paying rentals  for  government  property.  We
are trying to teach  our  people  there  is  nothing  for  mahala.  Improved
property  management  has  made  a  significant  impact   on   the   revenue
collection.

Amongst others, the property and  facility  unit  co-ordinate  the  sale  of
surplus government houses and improves  payment  of  rental  for  government
houses. Twenty-seven deeds of sale to the  value  of  R2 974 000  have  been
signed. The  unit  is  also  addressing  the  issue  of  arrear  rentals  on
government houses. Fourteen stop orders for  rentals  have  been  signed  of
which R105 000 has been collected. These are just a  few  things  that  show
that we are not only put back, we also get back. What  do  we  do  with  the
money that comes back? Obviously it goes back into the fiscus and we  plough
it back into the communities.

One of the problems that we have, that we are sometimes frustrated about  is
that some of the employees think that you can give  them  parking  for  free
and also give them houses and cars for free. We demonstrate that we  act  as
a business in Mpumalanga.

When you come to Public  Works,  the  mandate  for  the  Chief  Directorate:
Maintenance is to do preventative maintenance on our  roads  and  government
building infrastructure, thus improving their  life  span.  The  maintenance
done includes heavy rehabilitation of the province's regional roads  network
by providing substance drainage, patching, cleaning  of  culverts  and  side
drains, erection of guard-rails and  road  signs,  weed  control  and  grass
cutting off road shoulders, reshaping and grading of road shoulders as  well
as fog spray and road markings. However, the  allocated  budget  allowed  to
fulfil this mandate is far from sufficient and the department  was  severely
challenged by limited resources.

All of the facts above relate to  service  delivery.  In  the  Gert  Sibande
region, for instance, R15 million was spent on  routine  maintenance,  which
includes the erection and repair to guard-rails. An amount of R22,1  million
was spent in the Nkangala region to erect road  signs;   road  markings  and
patching along acquired half of the amount mentioned.

The  maintenance  unit  also  spent  R805 000  on  the  renovation  of   the
Kwamhlanga government complex. The sum of R1,8  million  was  spent  on  the
renovation of the Piet Koornhof building in Witbank. Twenty-five  government
houses in Middelburg, 11 in Delmas and six in Dr J S Moroka as  well  as  20
prefabricated  houses  at  Standerton,  Amersfoort  and  Piet  Retief   were
renovated at a cost of more than R1,7 million.

In order to address the  backlog  in  building  and  road  maintenance,  the
department  will  appoint  more   contractors,   particularly   historically
disadvantaged  individuals,  and  outsource  projects  as  well  as  improve
maintenance inspection and quality control on work done. There will also  be
a drive to  improve  the  productivity  and  develop  the  capacity  of  our
regional workforce.

During the 2003-04  financial  year,  seven  of  the  department's  district
offices will be renovated at a total cost  of  R8,4 million.  We  will  also
continue with the  renovation  of  a  further  30  prefabricated  government
houses in Standerton at an estimated cost of R1,2  million.  Renovations  at
the Kwamhlanga government complex will continue and a further  R3,4  million
will be spent there. The department also intends to continue to  fulfil  its
function as a municipal manager at  Pilgrims  Rest  by  upgrading  the  town
sewer system plant at a cost of R1,5 million.

In the Gert Sibande region, the road between Ermelo  and  Oshoek,  which  is
P81/4, will be marked and the  Greylingstad  to  Leeuwspruit  Road  will  be
selectively regravelled and  reshaped.  The  Carolina/Wharburton  Road  will
also receive attention in terms of upgrading. In the  Nkangala  region,  R23
million will be spent on routine road  maintenance,  and  in  the  Ehlanzeni
region R11 million will be spent on road patching, road marking,  grass  and
bush  cutting,  blending  of  gravel  roads  and  the   rehabilitation   and
regravelling of provincial roads.
In all these projects,  90%  of  the  people  who  are  involved  are  women
contractors. I must also  emphasise  that  we  have  serious  problems  with
financing these women contractors, but as  a  committed  government  we  are
dealing with this problem by making sure that people are paid on  time,  and
making sure that the guarantees for these  contractors  are  signed  through
our MECs. The reason for this is because, when  these  women  get  contracts
and they go to the commercial  bank,  they  actually  do  not  finance  them
because they want guarantees from the people who want guarantees. All of  us
in South Africa know that black people, especially women, do not have  these
guarantees.

Regarding the  Community-Based  Public  Works  Programme,  this  is  a  very
interesting subject in Mpumalanga.  Mpumalanga  successfully  completed  six
Community-Based Public Works Programme cluster projects in  poverty-stricken
areas of our province  and  we  are  in  the  process  of  completing  seven
additional projects. These projects  are  amongst  the  province's  flagship
poverty alleviation and job creation projects.
As one of this province's main vehicles of job creation, the  department  is
taking its Community-Based Public Works Programme  extremely  seriously.  In
the past financial year, we  have  spent  more  than  R14  million  on  this
project in the poverty pockets of our province. This is  nearly  double  the
budget spent on the Community-Based Public Works Programme  in  2001-02.  In
2003-04, we would like to spend  another  R16,5  million  on  seven  cluster
projects identified by communities in the  Integrated  Development  Plan  of
the three district municipalities.

However, what is significant about this is not only that this department  is
putting  more  resources  into  job  creation  but  that  a  number  of  job
opportunities and economic opportunities are  also  increasing.  In  2001-02
... [Time expired.]

Dr P J C NEL: Thank you,  Madam  Chair.  [Interjections.]  Madam  Chair,  by
correcting  some  of  the  mistakes  from  the  past,  the  department   has
demonstrated, in the past financial year, that it now has  the  capacity  to
spend its allocated budget.
Moving from severe underspending in the past, the department  has  overspent
by plus-minus R40 million  in  the  previous  year.  According  to  the  IFR
document, provincial capital expenditure grew from  R6,4  billion  in  1999-
2000 financial year to R13,4 billion in the previous financial year.

It is quite clear that through  experience  and  the  implementing  of  far-
reaching budget reforms, the national department as well as  the  provincial
departments  have  succeeded  in  improving  their  expenditure   management
skills. The challenge now is to translate financial  management  gains  into
service delivery.  It  is,  however,  impossible  to  achieve  that  without
adequate funding.

According to the  department,  its  budgetary  allocation  for  the  current
financial year is totally  inadequate  to  fund  the  department's  critical
programmes. The total amount requested  was  R5  billion  and  the  proposed
allocation is R4,47 billion. What is most disturbing  is  the  shortfall  of
R180 million in the amount allocated for payment of leases and R300  million
for the  payment  of  rates,  taxes,  municipal  services  and  maintenance.
Failure to honour these commitments can result in departments being  evicted
from the offices they occupy.

Voorsitter, dit blyk ook uit 'n skriftelike antwoord van  die  Minister  van
Provinsiale  en  Plaaslike  Regering  dat  'n  hele   aantal   departemente,
nasionaal asook provinsiaal, aan talle munisipaliteite geld skuld, geld  wat
vir hierdie  munisipaliteite  lewensnoodsaaklik  is  om  dienste  te  lewer.
(Translation of Afrkaans paragraph follows.)

(Chairperson, it also appears from a written  reply  from  the  Minister  of
Provincial  and  Local  Government  that  quite  a  number  of  departments,
nationally as well as provincially, owe money  to  numerous  municipalities,
money which is absolutely essential  for  these  municipalities  to  deliver
services.]

Madam  Chair,  the  critical  capital  budget  shortfall  for  the   current
financial year in the Free State is estimated to  be  R216  million.  Taking
into account that the backlog in works infrastructure alone  at  the  moment
is R1,25 billion, it is quite  clear  that  this  will  have  a  devastating
impact on the existing infrastructure.

Voorsitter, ek was egter aangenaam verras om vandag van die agb Minister  te
verneem  dat  daar  uiteindelik  fondse   vir   die   konstruksie   van   'n
polisiekantoor in Thabong beskikbaar gestel is, want ek kon dit nie  in  die
bouprogram  van  die  departement  bespeur  nie.  Ek   is   egter   verbaas,
Voorsitter, om te sien dat die konstruksie van die  Bronville-polisiekantoor
nog nie op die lys verskyn nie. Dít nadat die agb  Minister  van  Veiligheid
en  Sekuriteit  my  skriftelik   in   kennis   gestel   het   dat   genoemde
polisiekantoor hoog op die prioriteitslys is.

Die polisie in Bronville bedien vir die afgelope 31 jaar 'n  gemeenskap  van
250 000 mense uit 'n klein huisie. Voorsitter, ek is  dankbaar  om  te  sien
dat die bedrag van R145 miljoen toegewys is vir kuns en  kultuur,  waaronder
historiese gebou ressorteer. Die Vrystaat het egter net R62 000  gekry,  wat
geheel en al ontoereikend is.

Voorsitter, die instandhouding van hierdie geboue is  baie  duur,  soos  dit
duidelik blyk uit die glanstydskrif, At Your Service,  van  die  Departement
van Werke. As 'n mens egter in  genoemde  tydskrif  kyk  na  die  wonderlike
resultate wat bereik is by byvoorbeeld die  Griekwalandse  Hooggeregshof  in
Barkley-Wes en die ou landdroskantore in Kimberley, dan is dit  oor  en  oor
die moeite werd. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Chairperson, I was, however, pleasantly surprised to  be  informed  by  the
hon Minister today that funds have at  last  been  made  available  for  the
construction of a police station in Thabong, because I could not find it  in
the  building  programme  of  the  department.  However,  I  am   surprised,
Chairperson, to see that the construction of the  Bronville  police  station
does not yet appear on the list. What is more, this is  after  the  Minister
of Safety and Security informed me in writing that the said  police  station
was high on the priority list.

The police in Bronville have been serving a  community  of  250  000  people
from a small house for the past 31 years. Chairperson, I am grateful to  see
that an amount of R145 million has been  allocated  for  arts  and  culture,
under which historic buildings fall. However, the Free State  received  only
R62 000, which is totally inadequate.

Chairperson, the maintenance of these buildings is  very  expensive,  as  is
clear from an article in the  glossy  magazine,  At  Your  Service,  of  the
Department of Works. However, if one looks  in  the  said  magazine  at  the
wonderful results achieved, for example, at the Griqualand Supreme Court  at
Barkley West and the old magistrate's court in Kimberley, then  it  is  more
than worthwhile.]

Cultural tourism is the fastest growing component of  the  tourism  industry
worldwide. Beautiful scenery exists everywhere but the  uniqueness  inherent
in the built heritage of a  country  is  what  draws  visitors  to  specific
places. The generation of more money to repair and maintain these  buildings
is important.

Die Kaapse Vennootskap is 'n baie goeie voorbeeld van hoe om binne  'n  kort
tydperk miljoene rand se beleggings te lok en werkgeleenthede te  skep  deur
die stedelike vernuwing waarvan die restourasie  van  geboue  'n  belangrike
komponent uitmaak. (Translation of Afrkaans paragraph follows.)

[The Cape Partnership is a very good example of how to attract  millions  of
rands of investments and create job  opportunities  in  a  short  period  by
means of the urban renewal of which the restoration of  buildings  forms  an
important component.]

Restoration and maintenance projects of these  buildings  can  be  a  golden
opportunity to create jobs and empower local people to  perform  specialised
skills.

I want to conclude with the closing remark made by the department  in  their
budget preview document. I quote:


  To this end, the department appeals to the committee to provide  whatever
  support it has to ensure that additional funding is  received  as  indeed
  the cutback on expenditure is not a realistic solution to the problem.

As a member of the committee, I would like to request the  hon  Minister  of
Finance to take note of this cry for help. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER  OF  PUBLIC  WORKS:  Deputy  Chairperson,  the  hon  the
Minister, hon MECs responsible for public  works  and  hon  members,  in  my
supporting role to the Minister of Public Works, I exercise  oversight  over
prestige Government accommodation. This includes the Union  Buildings  which
house the Presidency and the Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs,  the  Brynterion
Estate, which is an official residential complex that houses  our  President
and Deputy President,  Ministers  and  Deputy  Ministers  in  Pretoria,  the
parliamentary precincts, Groote Schuur, Walmer Estate and other  estates  as
well as the  parliamentary  villages  in  Cape  Town.  This  indeed  is  our
nation's family silver which should, at all times, be  properly  managed  so
that we can preserve and enhance its worth for posterity.

From time to time, the Minister assigns other tasks to me over and above  my
primary ones, as  a  manifestation  of  the  good  teamwork  which  she  has
cultivated in the Ministry and department. I will accordingly  be  reporting
on some of these tasks during the course of my address.

Under prestige  accommodation,  a  total  of  R43,2  million  was  spent  on
prestige accommodation last  year  and,  for  the  current  financial  year,
R98 million has been budgeted. This will enable us to properly  manage  this
portfolio through measures  such  as  the  Facilities  Management  Contract.
Since 1 May this year, WSP Sidibene Facilities  Management  (Pty)  Ltd,  who
won this tender for R82,2 million over two years in Cape Town, has  been  in
full operation. This is an international company that  has  formed  a  joint
venture with local companies  incorporating  set  socioeconomic  objectives.
This joint venture is made up  as  follows:  WSP  Facilities  Management  SA
(Pty) Ltd  together  with  ACG  Architects  and  Development  Planners;  GVK
Siyazama Building Contractors Cape (Pty) Ltd,  Ubunye  Engineering  Services
(Pty) Ltd; and Nibiru  Construction  and  Project  Management  with  Premier
Business Capital (Pty) Ltd.

They are working at prestige office and housing accommodation including  the
parliamentary  precinct,  VIP  houses  and   parliamentary   villages.   The
objective is to provide the expected day-to-day services and  to  attend  to
the  backlog  in  maintenance.  At  present,  the  priority  list   on   the
maintenance backlog is being finalised. The mammoth task of  rectifying  the
backlog is anticipated to start within a few weeks.

The scope of work on this Facilities Management Contract  includes  managing
and controlling  the  provision  of  services,  performance  monitoring  and
evaluation of facilities and  service  delivery,  establishment  of  a  call
centre, establishment of a State Property Asset Management  and  Information
System, and management  of  all  types  of  capital  and  maintenance.  Also
included are the requirements in terms of the presidential health plan.

In terms of  the  contract,  and  after  consultation  with  the  SA  Police
Service, WSP's personnel has been security-cleared in the same  manner  that
all the Department of Public Work's employees  are  subjected  to.  This  in
effect means that not only will they be checked by  SAPS  but  also  by  the
National Intelligence Agency.

Then I come to the project which  deals  with  the  accessibility  of  these
buildings and premises to people with disabilities. Public Works  has  also,
in the beginning of 2003, commenced with the  project  to  upgrade  existing
facilities in Parliament with the aim of making the complex more  accessible
to people  with  disabilities.  The  objectives  of  the  project  are:  the
provision of accessible ablution facilities for people with disabilities  on
every floor and a fair distribution of such facilities across genders.  This
process includes the simultaneous renovation of all existing facilities.

Secondly, it includes the improvement  of  access  between  and  within  the
buildings with the  provision  of  external  wheelchair  routes  and  ramps;
improved lighting in public areas; improved signage and the modification  of
elevators to  enable  their  operation  by  people  with  disabilities;  and
alterations to existing debating chambers such as the ones that we see  here
which have produced a splendid Chamber indeed;  and  dining  and  conference
rooms in order to accommodate those who  use  wheelchairs.  The  project  is
scheduled to run over a 12 month period and is expected to be  completed  by
January next year. The value of the contract is small at R5 million.

As far as space planning and utilisation within the  parliamentary  precinct
is concerned, this is one more literally  pressing  issue  Public  Works  is
engaged in. Since 1994, the number of people working here has  increased  by
more than 30% and little attention has, however, been paid to the  provision
of office  space,  parking  space  and  other  things.  In  accordance  with
Parliament's wish, the department is  taking  a  holistic  approach  to  the
requirements of space, and the project will  include  120  Plein  Street  as
well as considering all offsite functional units for accommodation on site.

The assignment  includes  investigating  and  must,  in  six  month's  time,
provide us with a status quo report  in  respect  of  office  accommodation,
committee rooms and  boardrooms,  auditoriums,  chambers,  vehicle  parking,
etc.  The  SA  Heritage  Agency's  approval  will  be  obtained  should  any
alterations or  extensions  become  necessary  to  buildings  with  heritage
status.

The crime rate at the parliamentary villages, mainly in Acacia Park, as  hon
members would know, is of unacceptable proportions  and  we,  together  with
the Police, are working seriously on solutions. At  least  10  arrests  have
been made in the preceding 12 months, the outcome  of  which  we  are  still
awaiting.

Alarm systems have been installed at all the residences during 2002  and  in
addition further security measures  are  being  introduced  and  considered.
These include the physical search of all incoming and outgoing  vehicles  at
the gates and the investigation of the introduction of an electronic  access
control  system,  although  major  resistance  to  this  measure  has   been
expressed in the past by residents' committees.  We  are  looking  into  the
installation of burglar bars at all residences and requesting  the  SAPS  to
increase the number of VIP protection staff to ensure regular foot  patrols.
We are also  conducting  an  occupancy  audit  at  all  three  parliamentary
villages in order to compare  the  results  to  the  information  which  was
originally supplied by  members  and  sessional  officials  when  they  made
application for accommodation.

These additional measures will increase the cost of security in Acacia  Park
from the  existing  R1,5  million  to  an  estimated  R4  million.  For  the
remainder, the parliamentary villages  will  be  taken  care  of  under  the
Facilities Management Contract I spoke about. I hope that hon  members  have
already experienced an improvement in the service delivery both through  the
call centre and in the overall appearance of the parks.

Our departmental activities regarding fraud prevention  continues.  We  have
found  the  enticing  of  officials  to  collaborate  with  contractors   in
fraudulent conduct for obviously personal financial  gain  to  be  the  main
occurrence. At present, 11 disciplinary cases  and  11  criminal  cases  are
being dealt with.  The  strengthening  of  our  implementation  of  findings
through the human resource section is a challenge that we are aware of.

I am proud to report that on the cholera infrastructure  support  programme,
we have achieved 100% expenditure on almost R2 million  that  was  allocated
in 2002-03 for building 1 395 toilets and protecting numerous  springs  from
contamination in order to prevent the spread of cholera.

The socieconomic achievements include 40% of the project budget  which  went
to community labour, 300 people got jobs of whom  58%  were  women  and  30%
youth and 9% people with disabilities. This far exceeds our minimum  targets
in procurement.

The HIV/Aids infrastructure  support  programme  also  achieved  an  overall
expenditure of 95% on just over R5 million allocated in the  past  financial
year. This programme extended  over  four  provinces.  Both  Mpumalanga  and
KwaZulu-Natal had a 100% expenditure whereas Limpopo  is  experiencing  some
delay and the Free State had a saving which has subsequently  been  used  to
procure tools for the project site.

Another major policy development we are currently dealing with that  affects
all aspects of Government is the Government-wide Immovable Asset  Management
Framework. The key purpose of this  framework  is  to  establish  a  set  of
minimum norms and standards in respect of the management of  such  immovable
assets on a  Government-wide  basis.  This  will  mean  that  the  national,
provincial and  local  government  will  all  work  on  the  same  basis  of
increasing efficiency and that the  taxpayer  will  know  exactly  how  this
large asset and economic driver is managed by the  state.  Our  plan  is  to
have such a policy document translated into legislation in due course.

In conclusion, I trust that hon members will support us  in  this  important
work to ensure that our Government properties are indeed taken  care  of  in
such a fashion that we can leave our children a better world  than  the  one
we inherited. [Applause.]

Ms D R TSOTETSI (Gauteng): Chairperson, I  am  bringing  to  the  House  the
MEC's briefing for the NCOP Budget Vote on Public  Works.  I  say  it  is  a
briefing because Gauteng has done so much that if I were to get to  all  the
details, I would have to be allocated at least 30 minutes.  This  input  has
considered the strategic directives given by the President  in  his  address
to the National Assembly. We have also considered Premier Shilowa's  opening
address to the Gauteng provincial legislature on 24 February 2003.  Both  of
these inputs focused on, among other issues, infrastructure development  and
job  creation,  especially  since  this  will   benefit   our   marginalised
communities.

In order to push back the frontiers of poverty and create jobs, that is,  to
ensure  poverty  alleviation  and  job   creation   through   infrastructure
delivery,  we  have  the  Zivuseni  Programme.  The  premier  initiated  the
Zivuseni Poverty Alleviation Programme during the  2002-03  financial  year.
The launch of Zivuseni was meant to and will  continue  to  focus  on  those
sections of our communities so impoverished that freedom  and  democracy  to
them cannot appear in any form except in the form of bread.

Whilst Zivuseni projects are meant to improve  the  physical  conditions  of
public facilities used to deliver services to the public, it  simultaneously
addresses poverty alleviation and the creation of short-term jobs.  A  total
of 6 731 unemployed people obtained short-term employment  in  the  Zivuseni
projects during the 2002-03 financial year.

To date, a total of 115  projects  comprising  building  and  renovation  of
schools,  clinics  and  hospitals  and  waste   management   projects   were
implemented. Out of the 6 731 beneficiaries, a total of 60%  are  women  and
40% youth; of these, people  with  disabilities  account  for  a  negligible
0,08%, mainly due to the physical demands of the work  in  the  majority  of
the Zivuseni projects. A total of 1  295  people  received  accredited  life
skills and  technical  training  through  funding  from  the  Department  of
Labour. Through the contractors used on the Zivuseni projects, we reached  a
target of 80% black economic empowerment participation  during  the  2002-03
financial  year.  Our  target  for  the  current  financial  year   is   95%
participation by BEE contractors.

A target of 25 000 beneficiaries - 50% women, 25% youth and 1% to  3%  being
people with disabilities - has been set  for  the  2003-04  financial  year.
This will be achieved through, among other  things,  the  implementation  of
the adjusted and refined  Zivuseni  Programme.  Zivuseni's  budget  will  be
increased from R70 million to R150  million  during  the  2003-04  financial
year with a minimum target of 25 000 beneficiaries. A link-up  with  various
infrastructure  programmes  of  local  and  provincial  government  will  be
pursued in order to  maximise  the  developmental  impact  and  to  increase
participation  opportunities  for  the  beneficiaries  registered   on   the
Zivuseni database.

The department considers Public Works as  among  the  main  drivers  of  job
creation, fighting poverty  and  developing  community  infrastructure.  Our
Community-based Public Works Programme, Zivuseni, Potlaka projects,  capital
works,  maintenance  and  professional  services  programmes,  among   other
things, are focused on systematically addressing these imperatives.

Creating jobs through infrastructure delivery again, job  creation  and  BEE
as intimated before, are the bedrock of most of our capital works  projects.
Capital expenditure, labour maximation  programmes,  contractor  development
programme, our labour-intensive programme and the strategic  works  projects
guide the execution of most of our capital works, both for other  government
departments as well  as  for  our  department's  infrastructure  development
initiatives including the development of our road infrastructure.
The Capex and Labmax programmes are aimed at increasing the  labour  content
of all our capital works projects. An average  of  35%  labour  content  has
thus far been maintained for all our programmes. This approach  has  yielded
32 548 jobs during the 2002-03 financial year at  a  total  cost  of  R1,315
billion, which includes capital  expenditure  for  client  departments.  The
department spent R960 million on the improvement of infrastructure.

Regarding the labour-intensive programme for Public Works, with a budget  of
R30 million, our LIP has created 1 502 jobs, a 30% increase compared to  the
previous year. The socioeconomic impact analysis that was conducted for  our
LIP shows that 8 900 people benefited from the  jobs  created  through  this
LIP system.

Our target for 2003-04 is to obtain  between  45%  to  55%  labour  content.
Through this, we intend to create an additional 2 000  jobs  from  the  same
level of expenditure. This will be achieved through  changes  to  technology
and  documentation  of  projects  as  well  as   accelerating   construction
processes.

As regards LIP for roads, in  the  roads  construction  area,  most  of  the
department's  funding  for  transport  infrastructure  is  spent   on   road
rehabilitation and maintenance. A significant portion  is  also  focused  on
new projects aimed at improving accessibility and  economic  development  in
previously  neglected  areas.  Through  these   various   construction   and
maintenance contracts, we were able  to  create  3  100  jobs  in  the  last
financial year.

The department makes an annual allocation of funds for projects  to  enhance
labour-based  construction.  These  projects   are   transport-related   and
situated  in  previously  disadvantaged  areas.  It  is  intended  that  the
projects will make a contribution to the  upliftment  of  the  local  people
through job creation.

Some of the main issues addressed by  the  project  include:  that  that  it
should be a prerequisite; the creation of work  for  the  community  in  the
vicinity of the project  should  be  within  walking  distance  thereof  the
provision of all-weather streets, thus  concentrating  on  proper  drainage,
that will only be able to carry low-traffic volumes; or the construction  of
other transport-related infrastructure, eg bus  bays  and  shelter,  bicycle
and pedestrian paths.

The  projects  must  entail  labour-based  construction  or   rehabilitation
methods. Emerging contractors are  to  be  used  under  the  supervision  of
established contractors. The  department  will  provide  funding  for  these
projects once the projects have been approved and prioritised.

Projects undertaken include, among others, Key  45  Golden  Highway  in  the
Vaal between Sebokeng and Evaton to the amount of R45 million that  went  to
subcontractors and, with  the  R23  Kwaduduza,  R4  million  went  to  three
subcontractors. In Coronationville, an amount of R2,5  million  went  to  34
subcontractors. The department's contributions in the empowerment  of  SMMEs
has not  been  insignificant.  An  amount  of  R38,5  million  was  expended
directly on SMMEs and local contractors.

In terms of the broad job creation strategy,  although  the  department  has
gradually been expanding LIP, it was nevertheless felt  that  we  needed  to
leapfrog and  broaden  LIP  across  the  department  and  other  departments
accordingly. The executive  council  has  recently  approved  the  framework
policy and strategy for the implementation  of  the  total  labour-intensive
approach to the whole of the  provincial  government  in  this  regard.  The
premier will announce further developments in this regard.

In concluding this matter, I wish to say that the  key  strategic  objective
of the Gauteng provincial government of fighting poverty and  creating  jobs
is  indeed  achievable  through  the  total  labour  approach  strategy  and
framework. The province's  multipronged  strategy  along  the  job  creation
continuum, starting with Zivuseni through labour intensity to Blue IQ,  will
go a long way in reducing unemployment in Gauteng.
When it  comes  to  BEE  and  SMME  development  that  is  executed  through
procurement, the department has  actively  promoted  BEE,  small  contractor
development and gender equality by  instituting  special  projects  in  this
regard, changing  our  standard  contract  documentation  to  reflect  these
priorities and identifying the specific areas where opportunities  to  reach
these goals can be created. These objectives have also been critical in  the
granting  of  contracts   to   consultants,   contractors   and   suppliers.
Contractors and suppliers  are  appointed  through  the  three  departmental
acquisition  councils  via  a  tendering  process,  whilst  consultants  are
appointed in the main from the preapproved consultants' rosters.

The total amount of money spent by the whole province on capital  works  was
R1,3 billion  in  the  last  financial  year.  Of  this  R1,3  billion,  the
department was responsible for R1,105 billion as a client  and  implementing
agent. The DACs gave out 188 tenders  to  contractors  for  both  roads  and
building works to the value of R560 million. The  department's  contribution
towards  BEE  was  as  follows:  Seventy-five  of  the  contracts  went   to
historically disadvantaged  individual-owned  SMMEs  to  the  value  of  101
million; 13 went to non-HDI-owned SMMEs to the value of R14 million;  30  of
the contractors were allocated to large HDI-owned enterprises to  the  value
of R241 million, whilst 70  contracts  were  given  to  large  non-HID-owned
companies to the value of R203  million.  Contractor  development  programme
initiated in 1996-97 ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs F X GAZA (KwaZulu-Natal): I thought I  was  in  a  different  House.  It
looks like all these Houses are the same. Madam Chair ... Excuse me, sir!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J MAHLANGU): I am not yet both.

Mrs F X GAZA: I am very sorry. I would take exception if it was done  to  me
too. [Laughter.]

Chairperson, members of the NCOP, Minister, my deputy and all my  colleagues
who have come from all the different provinces, it is  with  enormous  pride
that I speak on this budget  which  we  in  KwaZulu-Natal  support.  Reading
through it and seeing how far South Africa has  come  in  the  international
community fills us with the realisation that we  have  become  an  exemplary
nation.

Our long walk has been hard but, truly, we have learnt great things.  It  is
indeed a pity that people who have not taken stock of the contribution  that
this department seems to be making for  the  country  are  very  shallow  in
their criticism. There is enough evidence  in  KwaZulu-Natal  to  illustrate
the degree to which this department has thrown its weight behind making  the
lives of our people better.  We  congratulate  the  national  Department  of
Public Works for spending almost 100% of its capital budget as well as  R557
000 000 of its maintenance budget. This shows the position, a very  positive
move, a paradigm shift that, instead of  hoarding  money,  it  needs  to  be
spent for the people it is meant for, and this  department  has  illustrated
that very well.

This department is commended for the galloping speed with  which  they  have
focused on the Repair and  Maintenance  Programme.  In  the  past,  we  have
suffered, schools have suffered, government offices have  been  dilapidated,
but with this department and the way it  pushes  through,  and  the  way  it
builds all its needs on what the people need, we have seen quite  a  lot  of
preparation go to the communities to alleviate the suffering of the  people;
not only at provincial level, but also at local level. They are there to  be
seen to be doing the work which they have  committed  themselves  to  doing,
and KZN is very proud of them.

I do not want to be singing the praises of the Minister here,  but  one  has
to tell it as it is. They are always visible in KZN. [Interjections.]  Don't
tamper  with  my  Sunday-school  manners.  Next  to  Empangeni  and  Durban-
Westville, we have a showcase - not that I am necessarily saying that  jails
should be beautiful  because  it  could  send  a  different  message  -  but
regarding what the Minister said when she was talking about  how  much  they
support Correctional Services, we can illustrate that Empangeni and  Durban-
Westville were not catered for.

I shall not go to figures as the Minister has already illustrated this  when
she was handling this aspect. Coming to  the  Community-Based  Public  Works
Programme, I am very happy to report that the women and the youth, to  count
but a few, are very involved in this. There is Zakheleni with 25  women  and
10 men; Siphathiseni with 30 women and 12 men; and  Ekukhuphukeni  with  100
women and 50 men who are busy on construction. This really gives  us  a  lot
of impetus in terms of boasting about how  the  youth,  women  and  men  are
involved in this province.

In terms of the involvement in the community-based projects, in KZN we  have
not forgotten the commitment which we made  to  fighting  HIV/Aids.  In  all
these structures where we have got  hospices,  you  will  find  women  going
there, tilling the soil, assisting  and  working  under  the  Department  of
Public Works. We had quite a lot of  assistance  because  there  are  places
where we do not have enough water.
In conclusion, I must say we are quite happy to note  that  people  are  now
beginning to see the Department of Public  Works  in  the  true  perspective
that  it  needs  to  be  seen  in.  We  also  commend  them  for  not   only
concentrating on the department but also building up structures  with  other
departments to make work  quite  easy  for  our  communities.  KwaZulu-Natal
supports this budget. [Applause.] [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: (Mr M J MAHLANGU)  Please,  no  dialogue
in the House. It's a debate. [Laughter.] Minister, a great  expectation  has
been created. To you and your Deputy Minister, we  would  like  to  see  you
often in our constituencies. I do not know whether you will be able  to  get
to all the constituencies. [Laughter.]

Nksz B N DLULANE: Sihlalo  ohloniphekileyo,  Mphathiswa,  Sekela-Mphathiswa,
baphathiswa   bamaphondo   kunye   nabameli   abahloniphekileyo,   ndisukuma
namhlanje ndixhasa le nkqubo  esikuyo  esize  kuyandlalelwa  ngabaphathiswa.
Sixhasa siyi-ANC.
Kambe xa ndiqala kuwe Sekela-Mphathiswa, uthethile kamnandi  kodwa  andikuva
uthetha  ngentlungu  yamalungu  la  alapha  kwezi  zindlu   zombini.   Kukho

owabelwe yona  kuhlahlo  lwabiwo-mali,  ukuze  zikhwele  abahlonitshwa  aba.
Kambe imeko yazo imbi kakhulu. Siyayivuyela le yezindlu apho sihlala  khona.

Naphaya  komkhulu  kwaDalindyebo  sinijongile.  (Translation   of   isiXhosa
paragraphs follows.)

[Ms B N DLULANE: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  hon
MECs and delegates, I rise here today in support of the programme  that  the
hon Ministers have presented to us. We support it as the ANC.

Hon Minister, if I may start with you, you have talked well  but  I  do  not
hear you talking about the pain of the Members in these  two  Houses.  There
is a bus service for hon Members whose buses are in  a  very  bad  condition
and for which payment is made from the  funds  allocated  for  you  in  your
budget. We are grateful for the  houses  we  live  in.  Their  condition  is
improving ever so slightly because there is continuous  oversight.  I  would
like you, hon Minister, to carefully look at the issue of these buses.

To the leader that comes from the North-West province, we are  grateful  for
we, as the ANC in the Eastern Cape have also benefited from the building  of
mansions  through  your  initiated  multiprojects.   Recently   the   Deputy
President, who is also the Deputy President of the ANC,  Mr  Zuma,  launched
these projects in both royal houses. That is  in  line  with  what  the  ANC
encourages: about traditional leaders being granted  their  dignity  because
they are leaders of the people who vote for us. At Nyandeni  and  at  Qamata
machines are running and there is a  lot  of  activity.  Soon  you  will  be
visiting  there.  We  will  also  be  looking  forward  to  seeing  you   at
Dalindyebo's royal house too.]

The Department of Public Works  plays  a  vital  role  in  our  struggle  to
reverse the legacy of poverty and  underdevelopment.  Through  its  Extended
Public Works Programme which  seeks  to  promote  the  sustainable  economic
development of  South  Africa's  poorest  communities,  the  department  has
already made a significant impact on the lives of thousands  of  poor  South
Africans.  Although  the  number  of  permanent  jobs  created  is   clearly
insufficient to turn around the tide of unemployment and poverty  which  has
engulfed our country as a result of apartheid,  the  programme  nevertheless
enabled more than 80 000 people to raise  their  income.  This  demonstrates
the potential benefits which the Extended  Public  Works  Programme  has  to
offer.

The challenge facing us is to increase the number of sustainable jobs if  we
want to make significant dents in the  immediate  unemployment  and  poverty
situation. However, we all know that this is not going to be  an  easy  task
because of the structural nature of unemployment  and  poverty.  The  formal
economic sector and foreign investment will not  necessarily  be  enough  to
change the unemployment and  poverty  situation  in  our  country.  This  is
because the formal  sector  and  foreign  investors  demand  highly  skilled
labour while the majority of the unemployed are poorly skilled. It needs  to
be complemented by a strategy that will create  sustainable  livelihood  for
our people.

Hence we have developed the Expanded Public Works Programme  that  is  aimed
at  empowering  people  with  skills  which  they  can  use  in  creating  a
sustainable livelihood for themselves. Providing people  with  these  skills
is very important given the fact that some Public  Works  projects  are  not
intended to enable access to any permanent source of income  for  all  those
who participated in its creation.

In terms  of  the  Public  Works  programme  and  gender  equality,  another
positive aspect flowing from our Public Works programme  is  the  extent  to
which these programmes are able to reach and benefit women. Because  of  the
structure of gender relations in most societies, the  social,  cultural  and
economic constraints specifically confronting poor women may result in  them
failing to benefit from these programmes.

Fortunately,  our  Public  Works  programme  is  not  encumbered  by   these
problems. A measurable achievement of the Department  of  Public  Works  and
indeed most government departments is the extent to  which  they  have  been
able to integrate women in the development process  and  strengthened  their
participation  in  poverty  alleviation  programmes.  This  achievement   is
demonstrated by the fact that almost  half  the  jobs  created  through  our
expanded Public Works programme have gone to women.

In addition, the ANC is also mindful of the immense potential of the  Public
Works programme to change the gender division of labour and  promote  gender
equality particularly in our rural areas. In rural areas,  women's  work  is
normally perceived to be limited to beer  brewing,  making  of  handicrafts,
raising small livestock, but ...

... ibisinceda ke loo nto bootata  ababuya  emgodini.  Besiziphatha  kakuhle
iinkomo, babuye zizele zininzi. [That helped us a lot, if  you  should  know
as men who would be coming from the mines. We took  care  of  livestock  and
men would find that more had been born.]

The  participation  of  women,  for  example,  in  construction,   an   area
considered a man's domain, opens up new  areas  for  employment  and  income
generation. It contributes to  the  development  of  new  perceptions  about
women's potential and capabilities as well  as  building  up  women's  self-
confidence.

Ingqinwe yile nto ndigqiba ukuyitsho apha  ngentla.  Bakuba  bekhona  ootata
bonqena nokuvuka bakhaphele ezo nkomo. Abazisezi mayeza, abaziqhelanga  kuba
badla ngokushiya sityala  emasimini,  sijijitheka  namakhuba  kodwa  sikwazi
ukwenza kuba khona impumelelo. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[That is supported by what I mentioned earlier. When they are at home  these
men are so lazy they cannot even drive cattle to the  fields.  They  do  not
administer medicine to them, they are not used to them  because  they  would
just leave us having a difficult time  ploughing  the  fields,  but  we  had
success.]

The ANC endorses  the  principle  that  infrastructure  development  is  the
primary driver to change the structural nature of poverty and  unemployment.
Our Expanded Public Works Programme is therefore targeted at  the  provision
of infrastructure, particularly basic social and municipal services  through
labour-intensive methods that maximise job creation and skills development.

Furthermore, it is  also  directed  towards  achieving  integration  of  our
communities  and  deracialising  our  country.  Our  Extended  Public  Works
Programmes seeks to achieve these  objectives  through  the  realignment  of
current Government infrastructure and maintenance  investment  at  national,
provincial  and  local  government   level.   By   enhancing   intersectoral
integration  at  national,  provincial  and  local  government  level,   our
Extended Public  Works  Programme  is  providing  an  excellent  example  of
practical ways in which we can build on and strengthen the principles of co-
operative governance and joint planning.

Siyalibulela    kakhulu    isebe.    [Uwelewele.]    [We    are    grateful.
[Interjections.]]

Mr  M  MABUYAKHULU  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Chairperson,  hon   Minister,   Deputy
Minister,  colleagues,  hon  members  from  other  provinces  and  permanent
delegates, I rise to support the  speech  of  the  hon  Minister  of  Public
Works. Today's debate takes place on the eve of the Growth  and  Development
Summit that is expected, amongst other things,  to  highlight  the  critical
role of the Expanded Public Works Programmes as a response to  unemployment,
poverty  alleviation,  black  economic  empowerment  and  the  building   of
socioeconomic infrastructure that is greatly required in  our  country.  The
dominant view that Public Works is only  about  asset  management  of  state
assets is not only short-sighted, but must also change.

The strategic and critical role of Public  Works  is  far  larger  than  the
narrow depiction in terms of which the  various  departments  of  provincial
public works and the national Department of  Public  Works  are  considered.
Such a change needs to start from within Government because it  leads  to  a
distortion  of  the  role  of  Public  Works.  We  cannot  find  any   other
explanation why the budget we are debating today has  been  reduced  in  the
manner that it has been. We therefore, as  the  province  of  KwaZulu-Natal,
would like to express our concern about the fact that  the  national  budget
for Public Works has been significantly reduced, thus limiting the  capacity
of the Department of Public Works to play an effective role in pushing  back
the  frontiers  of  poverty.  We  also  strongly  believe  that  indeed  the
Department of Public Works must make a major contribution in  ensuring  that
we do increase the Extended Public Works Programmes in our country.

As KwaZulu-Natal, we are advocating for an Expanded Public  Works  Programme
that would create job opportunities for communities that live in and  around
the public facilities such as schools,  clinics,  government  buildings  and
publicly-owned facilities. We believe very strongly that an Expanded  Public
Works Programme should bring pride and restore integrity to our  people,  as
opposed to giving people the basic income grant where they have  not  worked
for anything. Our people like to work. Our people would like to  have  their
pride and dignity restored. They like to ensure  they  can  go  out  and  do
things for themselves and earn a living like any other citizen.

I would like to indicate  that  KwaZulu-Natal  is  currently  assessing  all
Public Works programmes that have taken place in  our  province.  Indeed  we
are glad that the Minister has now given authority  to  provincial  MECs  in
order for them to be  able  to  undertake  reviews  of  those  Public  Works
programmes that exist in each and every province, and to ensure  that  those
that are not performing well and are  not  viable  are  turned  around  into
viable programmes. We are, therefore,  currently  undertaking  a  review  of
existing projects in partnership with the National  Development  Agency.  At
the conclusion of this review, we are hoping to turn around  those  projects
that are not currently viable and make them work.  Our  slogan  in  KwaZulu-
Natal is: Let us work, but also let us  build  economic  prosperity  amongst
our people wherever they are.

In the past financial year, KwaZulu-Natal has spent just under R700  million
on capital works projects such as schools, clinics and major  works  in  the
province. In the current financial year, we expect to  spend  in  excess  of
more than a billion rand. Of this total  amount,  R452  million  is  in  the
schools building programme and  another  R180  million  is  in  the  schools
maintenance programme. The remainder will be spent on clinics  and  hospital
buildings and also maintaining government facilities  in  general.  KwaZulu-
Natal  is  in  the  process  of  passing  the  land  and  property  disposal
legislation. Yes, we have taken  note  of  the  input  made  by  the  Acting
Chairperson  here.  This  legislation  will  be  passed  by  the  provincial
legislature during the current financial year.

Whilst we welcome the devolution of  the  budget  for  rates  and  taxes  in
respect of provincial properties, we hope that the Minister  will  not  just
give us a once-off allocation and stop there. We believe very strongly  that
this should be provided for at least in the MTEF process. This would  enable
provinces to be able to budget in the MTEF budget circle.

In conclusion, therefore, in KwaZulu-Natal we are  grappling  with  some  of
the issues that we regard as challenges. Such challenges are  challenges  of
developing systems that will tell us not only about how many jobs have  been
created through capital works projects, but that can give us  a  far  bigger
picture than that. It should be a tool that can indicate to  us  the  direct
economic impact that each and every project has in the  economic  community;
that can give us an  indication  of  the  multiplier  effect  to  the  local
economy - in other words, to what extent is  it  able  to  attract  private-
sector investment - and that can also give us an indication  of  the  direct
benefits to emerging entrepreneurs not just in  percentages  alone,  but  in
rand value terms as well as in the aggregate form.

We are also  developing  a  credible  and  modern  asset  register.  Such  a
register would become an  effective  tool  for  making  decisions  that  are
necessary in managing the assets of Government. We believe in  KwaZulu-Natal
that some of the so-called assets  that  probably  we  are  holding  on  our
balance sheets are not necessarily assets but liabilities and, as  a  result
of that, as a state we would be well-advised to ensure that we  find  a  way
of disposing of those liabilities as soon as we can.
KwaZulu-Natal is a giant and therefore it is not fazed by the task at  hand.
We support the budget and trust that it will  not  be  cut  further  in  the
forthcoming financial years. Instead we want to see growth taking  place  in
this budget. We therefore support the budget. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr  N  M  RAJU:  Chairperson,  Minister  and  Deputy  Minister  and  special
delegates and colleagues, as a responsible opposition, the  DA  cannot  deny
that the hon Minister  and  the  Department  of  Public  Works  have  worked
steadfastly to give a human face, as the hon Minister so aptly  put  it,  to
the  activities  of  the  department.  We  take  note  of  the  many   rural
infrastructure developments that have  been  substituted  for  the  drabness
that existed for many decades in the countryside. In the words  of  the  hon
Dr Nel, he euphemistically referred  to  the  deprivation  of  the  past  as
mistakes of the past.

As a permanent delegate from the province of KwaZulu-Natal,  I  must  concur
with the sentiments expressed by the special  delegate  from  KwaZulu-Natal,
Faith Gasa, extolling the beneficial operations and what,  as  she  put  it,
has happened in terms of a paradigm shift.

I must at the same time also concur with the remarks made by  the  hon  Mike
Mabuyakhulu who is the MEC for public works in my province, as to  the  true
nature of the role of the Public Works not merely as a minder  of  an  asset
register. I share with him the concern about the budget being  significantly
reduced when we take into account that my province, KZN, is one of the  more
rural-based provinces in the country, and therefore the needs of the  people
are paramount.

The DA believes that a large-scale labour-intensive  Public  Works  strategy
is an appropriate transitional programme for South Africa. According to  the
Commission of Development and Enterprise, the CDE, enough money has  already
been budgeted to fund the start of  the  new  large-scale,  labour-intensive
Public Works initiative.  Because  labour-intensive  Public  Works  projects
produce additional employment within existing  patterns  of  expenditure  by
substituting labour for capital equipment, they  will  not  pay  sustainable
demands on public funds. The important advantages  notwithstanding,  labour-
intensive activities are not a panacea or a quick fix.

Whilst  some  programmes  such  as  urban  clean-up   campaigns   could   be
implemented within a year, labour-intensive works  designed  to  create  new
infrastructure function best  and  spend  most  efficiently  as  part  of  a
multiyear transition plan.

According to the commission, a commitment is needed from the Presidency  and
the Cabinet to fund a labour-intensive Public  Works  strategy  as  long  as
this is  necessary  to  alleviate  unemployment.  The  strategy  has  to  be
designed in such a way that it can realistically grow to a size at which  it
can bring down unemployment by 5%  or  more.  This  will  require  extensive
private sector involvement.

In order to target the poor effectively,  be  sustainable  and  benefit  the
largest number of poor people, wages  paid  on  labour-intensive  activities
should be as close as possible to local informal wages for unskilled  casual
labour. Wages should certainly be much lower than the  formal  minimum  wage
in the capital-intensive construction industry and should be  tasked  based.
To prevent  corruption  and  obtain  a  product  of  the  required  quality,
contracts entered into between all levels  of  government  and  construction
companies  or  other  implementing  agencies,  should  incorporate   clearly
specified and fully binding requirements for  the  use  of  labour-intensive
methods.

A system must be set to  ensure  that  contractors,  consultants  and  other
implementors who act corruptly or deviate from the  contractual  obligations
in respect of  labour  intensity  or  other  requirements  will  have  their
contracts terminated and be excluded from further Public Works projects.

Care must also be taken to ensure that the new labour-intensive strategy  is
compatible with the  transformation  of  the  existing  construction  sector
under the auspices of the Construction Industry Development  Board.  Two  of
the main aims of the board which are procurement reform and  black  economic
empowerment are just as important to labour-intensive Public Works  projects
as they are to the conventional sector.

Equally, the strategy must supplement and not replace  Government's  current
or planned conventional infrastructure spending. The  two  programmes  could
make a dramatic contribution to employment creation.

Opening Parliament in February 2003, the  President  restated  the  goal  of
creating expanded Public Works Programmes and said that:  ``Government  must
act to ensure that we reduce  the  number  of  people  dependent  on  social
welfare and increase the number  relying  for  their  livelihood  on  normal
participation in the economy.''

A new labour-intensive strategy will bring together Government and  business
to build infrastructure and to create  jobs  for  the  unemployed  poor.  It
would be one of the best ways of creating  an  enduring  partnership  for  a
democratic South Africa at work. [Applause.]
Ms T ESSOP (Western Cape): Chairperson, hon delegates and  hon  Minister,  I
rise to congratulate the Minister and convey  our  support  for  her  budget
today. I am also honoured to follow on after my  counterpart  from  KwaZulu-
Natal who said that they are a giant. I want  to  proclaim  today  that  the
Western Cape is an emerging giant. [Laughter.]

We are emerging from a province that was previously controlled  by  the  DA.
The province is now being controlled by the  ANC/NNP  coalition  government.
We are emerging as part of the new South Africa where transformation in  the
Western Cape was,  unfortunately,  not  put  as  a  first  priority  of  the
previous government of the Western  Cape.  Therefore  I  am  very  proud  to
announce today that  in  this  particular  portfolio,  and  with  the  other
portfolios  in  the  Western   Cape   government,   we   have   fast-tracked
transformation in this province.

Last year in my speech in this House on this Budget Vote,  I  indicated  and
made commitments to our national Minister that we  would  start  putting  in
place the interventions that the rest of the country had  already  done.  So
let me spell out the priorities and some of the interventions that  we  have
put in place in this portfolio. My portfolio, as  members  can  see,  covers
transport and public works. So, when I define my priorities,  I  will  cover
both  portfolios  but  I  will  talk  about  the  public   works   portfolio
specifically.

The priorities for this department in this financial  year  is,  of  course,
public transport as a very key and first priority of the  department,  black
economic empowerment, job creation, poverty alleviation and,  finally,  road
safety.

In terms of public works, my budget for this  year  has  increased  for  the
public works  component  of  this  department  to  R692,3  million  and  for
Community-Based Public Works programmes, specifically, R48,5 million.

Let me deal with black economic empowerment as  our  first  priority.  On  1
April  2003,  we  launched  and  started   implementing   our   preferential
procurement  implementation  plan  which,  in  terms  of  our   preferential
procurement provincial policy, is required of each department. I am  pleased
to announce that my department is the first department in the  Western  Cape
administration to launch such a programme. This programme entails  a  number
of aspects. Firstly, we will put all  contracts  through  what  we  call  an
empowerment impact assessment. We will start phasing this in with all  those
contracts which are about 500 000 initially and,  then  eventually,  as  our
capacity grows we will do an empowerment impact assessment  on  all  of  our
contracts in this particular department.

What this empowerment impact assessment firstly looks at  is  at  maximising
job creation through the way we develop our contracts specification and  how
we maximise our PDI empowerment through all our contracts  so  that  we  can
achieve the targets we have set ourselves in this  department  in  terms  of
PDI empowerment.

It also deals with an emerging contractor development support  programme.  I
am proud to announce that we are,  in  this  financial  year,  going  to  be
specifically setting aside a targeted programme for women  in  construction.
We have also looked at targeting advertising  because  we  have  found  that
many PDI contractors do not have access to our tenders  because  we  do  not
advertise in a targeted way.

Finally, we have put in  place  and  I  have  appointed  an  evaluation  and
monitoring committee directly accountable to me,  which  is  independent  of
the department. This committee will specifically be doing an  audit  of  our
empowerment and looking at whether or not we have achieved our  targets  and
objectives. Secondly and very importantly,  it  will  also  be  tasked  with
doing forensic audits where we find that fronting is happening.  I  am  sure
members will agree that this is a very big problem in our BEE objectives.

Let me now turn to our Community-Based Public Works Programme. When  I  took
over this portfolio last year, this particular programme did not  appear  to
be part of the programme of public works under a DA-controlled government.
Mrs A M VERSFELD: [Inaudible.] [Interjections.]

Ms T ESSOP: Mrs Versfeld,  I  said  it  was  not  a  priority  under  a  DA-
controlled government. In fact we immediately instituted  such  a  programme
in the Western Cape ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J MAHLANGU): Order!

Ms T ESSOP: Deputy Chairperson, we in the Western Cape legislature are  used
to this howling.

We have instituted a programme and moved it from being  purely  a  community
access  roads  programme  which  targeted  district  municipalities  in  the
province, and shifted the emphasis to dealing  with  at  least  60%  of  our
budget being allocated to the metro. We have found, through the CSIR  study,
that there are large pockets of poverty in the metro  area  in  the  Western
Cape, and 40% of our budget will be allocated to rural areas.  We  are  also
shifting the focus from community access roads to  dealing  with  issues  of
public space, sidewalks and cycling paths in many of our poorer townships.

We have extended the programme to include a programme called  Zenzele  which
is really a lengthmen contract  programme  which  my  counterpart  from  the
Eastern Cape has clearly defined.  We  are  putting  in  place  a  programme
called  Saamstaan  which  is  a  building  maintenance  programme   creating
employment for the  youth  and  women  specifically.  We  have  a  cleansing
programme for our government motor vehicles. This also creates jobs.

We are proud to say that our experiential training programme,  which  is  an
internship programme in our department for tertiary students,  has  recently
won an award from the Peninsula Technikon. We are therefore  very  proud  of
that particular programme.

We held a construction summit on 29 May which  focused  on  two  key  areas.
These were black economic empowerment, and education and  capacity-building.
We would be very pleased to be part of  a  national  process  where  we  can
share the challenges with the Minister with regards to  the  initiatives  to
transform the construction industry. We hope we  can  form  partnerships  in
that regard.

In the department's national budget in the National Assembly the other  day,
the Minister announced an incubator programme and  we  would  like  to  form
partnerships in this regard. I am also pleased to announce that we  will  be
hosting our second Women in the Built  Environment  Summit  in  August  this
year. We hope to  invite  the  Minister  to  be  our  keynote  speaker.  So,
Minister, you are forewarned very early about the invitation. [Laughter.]

Let me now turn to property management.  We  have  currently  finalised  our
draft white paper for property management and shifted the  focus  from  what
was originally just purely an income-generating approach to the disposal  of
our assets to one that now looks at both income  generation  and  also  very
clearly at  meeting  our  socioeconomic  objectives  and,  in  this  regard,
releasing land for housing  and  land  restitution  purposes.  We  are  also
looking at ways of disposing our property to enhance our BEE  objectives  as
well.

We have  completed  our  asset  register  to  the  extent  that  it  can  be
completed. Of course there is the constant transfer of assets  to  provinces
via the section 28 certificates. As it  happens,  we  obviously  update  our
asset register. We are  currently  finalising  our  strategic  accommodation
plan with our user departments which will also include the signing  of  user
agreements with those different user departments.

We in the Western Cape have risen to the challenges that were  presented  to
us in terms of transformation both internally in terms  of  the  department,
and externally in terms of the issues relating to  what  our  President  has
highlighted as national challenges which are pushing back the  frontiers  of
poverty. We  are  proud  to  admit  that  we  will  continue  meeting  these
challenges as creatively as we can. I believe, as many  have  said  in  this
House, that the Department of Public Works becomes central  as  a  mobiliser
towards fulfilling all those objectives. [Applause.]

Rev M CHABAKU: Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon  Deputy  Minister,  special
delegates, hon delegates and  all  who  are  here,  I  need  to  preface  my
presentation by expressing my sincere appreciation  of  our  Minister  as  a
person and for the outreach and care she has shown in her Ministry.  So  far
all presenters have mentioned how fairly and widely she has  cared  for  all
the provinces in allocating assistance as adequately as  was  needed  within
the financial constraints  she  has  to  live  with.  We  truly  thank  you,
Minister, for your commitment. Even when  you  were  frail  in  health,  you
always gave the best of who you are. God bless you.

This debate on Public Works is of crucial importance to the Free State as  a
province which is at the centre of the country and thus,  for  decades,  has
been a magnet of many ventures of business and social programmes to such  an
extent that  our  hospitals,  clinics,  sports  grounds  and  administrative
buildings are in acute need of upgrading and maintenance.

To cite one example, the  Free  State  legislature  meets  in  a  historical
building called The Raadsaal.  It  is  in  need  of  major  maintenance  and
repairs. The ceiling  in  the  women's  toilets  has  had  leakages  and  is
threatening to fall down.

But the Free State decided to find ways that can employ more people who  are
acutely unemployed, especially in the small and rural townships, so that  we
can push back the frontiers of poverty. The crisis is  more  one  of  hunger
than of poverty. It is worse to be poor and hungry. The  worst,  of  course,
is to have the added burden of unemployment,  especially  amongst  the  most
vulnerable.

Thus we launched a building project in the small rural  town  of  Trompsburg
where we provided jobs to men, women and youth who are employed  in  labour-
intensive construction so as to give a chance to more people to  have  their
dignity restored  as  they  are  employed,  trained  and  earn  a  wage  for
themselves and are able to buy for themselves the needs of foods  and  other
requisites  rather  than  pray  and  prey  on  charities.  This  source   of
employment enabled recruitment of  labour  to  come  from  the  neighbouring
towns of Edenville, Smithfield, Reddersburg and other farming communities.

Men, women and youth scraped manually to create road which  was  later  laid
with bricks. They ferried mortar made of stronger forces and laid cables  in
record time. As a result,  they  have  built  a  conference  centre,  tennis
court, rugby and soccer  stadium,  cricket  and  basketball  sites.  It  was
lovely to see the facial changes in women and children  who  were  heads  of
households, orphans, youth, working men and those affected by HIV/Aids  when
they were also integrated into the workforce.

This was  our  Community-Based  Public  Works  programme.  The  venture  was
officially opened with pomp and splendour, well-covered  in  the  media  and
officially opened by the Minister of Sport, Arts and Recreation.
Under our poverty alleviation programme underway and  in  pursuance  of  our
Batho Pele policy,  we  have  the  following  seven  projects  that  are  in
operation  right  now:  a  community  hall  in  Luckhoff;  others   in   Van
Stadensrus, Bethanie, Bultfontein, Herzogville; and we are also building  an
access  road  to  Oppermansgronde;  and  at  Eureka,  which  is  a  juvenile
rehabilitation centre where they have a school. That facility is also  being
upgraded in Thaba Nchu.

These projects form part of the intervention measures for specific  poverty-
stricken communities to the value of R4,9 million  to  be  completed  within
this financial year of 2003-04. Within these funds,  many  were  trained  in
technical skills and 70 people, including women, were trained in  management
skills. They included vulnerable people who also included  youth  and  those
who are physically challenged.

This budget that was allocated had a huge developmental impact on the  rural
communities, especially of Xhariep in the main  Lejweleputswa  district.  We
have similar Community-Based Public Works Programmes underway  in  Qwa  Qwa,
the Maluti-a-Phafang Municipal  area  and  in  the  Xhariep  districts.  The
aforementioned areas  were  on  the  the  list  for  the  rehabilitation  of
internal roads.

Following our black empowerment  programme,  12  projects  were  awarded  to
women contractors to the value of  R22  million.  Some  of  these  were  not
controlled fully by women but a sizeable  number  of  women  benefited  from
these contracts. Some of these SMME companies that received  the  award  for
various parts of the contract that were owned and controlled  by  women  are
as  follows:  North  Free  State,  R11  million;  Thabo  Mofutsanyane,  R137
million; Xhariep, R1,9 million; and Lejweleputswa, R105 million. Free  State
is really on the move.

In this financial year, a minimum of 60% of our  procurement  was  allocated
to businesses owned by indigenous Africans, women and  companies  that  have
indigenous Africans as shareholders in  their  management.  This  is  not  a
racist or ethnic approach but practical efforts that  open  door  for  those
who, in the past, were never allowed even to  knock  on  those  doors.  This
redress of the past discrimination also shows the growing  support  of  such
an outreach beyond racial lines.

The Free State is fulfilling our wishes that are enshrined  in  our  Freedom
Charter where it states that people  not  only  have  rights  but  that  the
people shall share even the jobs without fear or favour. All the  people  of
God shall share in turning around this barren but free land  to  be  finally
the land of happiness, growth and creativity, as we care for all the  people
of God in the change; change not only in structures, but also in the  change
of the hearts of all  our  people  in  order  to  be  hate-free,  fear-free,
caring, sharing communities that are God-guided and people-centred.

Thanks to the ANC Government,  through  their  Public  Works  projects  that
enabled people to rise up and walk again, we have  reduced  poverty,  hunger
has been killed and productivity enhanced for the future  of  our  children,
our country and the world.  More  funding  will  continue  to  give  us  the
impetus to make more people love life as they become skilled and  shape  and
take charge of their own destiny.

This  is  the  Free  State.  Watch  it!  Khotso  Baratuwa!.   Sharp   sharp.
[Applause.]

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Thank you, Deputy Chair. I really  must  thank
all the hon members for their contribution to the Vote.  You  have  made  my
day. We want to believe that, as I said in the Assembly,  Public  Works  was
once regarded as just a department with nothing else but handymen.  We  want
to believe that we are a department which actually works for the country.  I
once said to the President that if all works well, we would like to  have  a
situation where, from Bizana to Galeshewe, we would actually feel as  if  we
were listening to the wheels of development literally moving.

What the President  had  to  say  this  year  as  part  of  his  speech  was
encouraging. He said that, yes, it is true that  we  have  all  the  various
grants that we have, but the important thing is to have a  South  Africa  in
which people are at work, because that brings the dignity  of  a  person  to
the fore.

I remember, in the early years of our democracy, that I was explaining at  a
meeting some of the things that Government  was  planning  to  do,  and  the
moneys Government was going to give. I mentioned the issue  of  housing  and
that it might even be extended to  some  of  the  rural  areas,  the  actual
locations. One man stood up and said, ``All we want is to get jobs  so  that
we can build our own houses''. He actually said that.

Yindoda enjani eza kwakhelwa indlu yenye indoda? [What kind  of  a  man  has
his house built by another man?]

In as much as this man, Mfundisi, was also against wearing  a  T-shirt  with
somebody else's head on it ... [Laughter.]

Yathi: ``Heyi!'' xa ihamba  ethubeni,  ``ndifath'  intloko  yeny'  indoda''.
[Kwahlekwa.] [And he said: ``Hey you!'' as he was leaving, ``I am wearing  a
T-shirt with somebody else's face on it.'' [Laughter.]]

We believe, in Public Works,  that  those  words  of  the  President  should
actually be followed. One of the reasons why I actually  elaborated  on  the
community production centres the way I did, was to say  that,  through  some
of the poverty relief programmes that we have, we could  actually  build  up
some dynamic economic enclaves even in the worst-off  rural  areas  that  we
have in South Africa.

Last year, when there was a food shortage, especially with  regard  to  some
of our neighbouring states, I actually felt bad that we had not  yet  worked
fully on the CPCs. I felt that, in all  our  provinces,  we  could  actually
have turned them into being pantries with  seeds  to  give  to  neighbouring
people when they have problems. I want to believe that when  we  talk  about
poverty relief, that is what we are  all  talking  about.  If  you  listened
carefully to the contributions  of  the  members,  especially  the  MECs,  I
smiled at what I heard and I  said  to  Mfundisi  -  I  call  him  Mfundisi,
umntan' am lo (my child). [Laughter.] - that our Minmec goes a long way.

I smiled because what was coming out of each contribution was a  meeting  of
minds, a planning together, and a  production  of  results.  It  is  also  a
recognition by national Government that you can never superimpose; you  must
also listen to  people  who  have  got  first-hand  experience  of  what  is
happening in the provinces. Then you put your act together. That  is  why  I
said, at the beginning, that I really appreciate  the  co-operation  that  I
have from the MECs who, by and large, could easily be  my  younger  brothers
or even my sons and daughters.

While I am talking about the MECs, I just want to congratulate  the  Western
Cape for having had their provincial summit, and I just to remind  my  other
colleagues that our national summit is in October, and it would be  good  if
they could have their summits now.

In answer to some of the questions that arose, I would like  to  assure  the
hon Nel that when expenditure was not happening in Public Works, we  decided
that we were going to be a service department which has  clients,  and  that
those client departments should say what it is that we must do.

We got a wake-up call when, after eighteen months of planning,  when  I  got
to Public Works, I realised that, goodness me, planning  took  such  a  long
time. I didn't know that. When, after a  lengthy  period  of  planning,  one
department just said: ``We are changing our minds, we are  no  longer  going
to have this project'', we then  decided  that  the  departments  must  have
their budgets for capital works, not for everything, and  that  they  should
bring us a prioritised list of what they want us  to  do.  From  that  point
onwards, we turned history around.

I found a situation where people just believed that the  budget  on  capital
works is never fully spent in Public Works ...

Imbali. Futhi kuhlalwe ... [It is history. And people would just relax ...]

... and people just believed that it was the order of  the  day.  But,  with
the new thinking,  that  has  removed  relaxation  on  the  part  of  sister
departments, because now they have to account  for  the  other  expenditure,
and not us. That is why, with their help - and  I  appreciate  all  the  co-
operation we have had coming from sister departments -  we  can  now  really
say, as far as underexpenditure on capital works is concerned that the  tide
has turned.

The only problem is that the type  of  inheritance  we  got  of  dilapidated
buildings is problematic, because we cannot cover them all in  one  goal.  I
normally say ...

... eMaMpondweni, Nakundixolela, eMaMpondweni sithetha nanjani  na.  [Please
excuse me, as amaMpondo we speak anyhow.]

When people want to make impossible demands, it is only  a  few  people  who
get quadruplets or quintuplets. Children are  normally  staggered;  that  is
what God does in most cases. So at times when people are impatient  with  us
and think that delivery from Government must be like a  storm,  they  should
bear in mind that stormwaters at times become very rough and destructive.

Things become rough, at times, for some of the contractors  we  have,  where
they will look at the cost of the tender they  have  just  won  and  already
plan for the car before finishing or even starting on the road. And then  we
end up getting what I called shaved roads or winter roads. For, if they  are
shaved, only the grader will go through; you won't find any  gravel  or  any
stone work. Those roads look good in  winter,  but  come  summer,  they  get
washed away.

I would like to implore hon members as citizens of  this  country  who  must
safeguard the money of Government, to report when they feel that whoever  is
doing work on behalf of Government is playing games with  us.  Otherwise  it
becomes a useless process. Not far from my place - I just say this  since  I
was angry about it and because I am in Public Works -  that  the  provincial
government has been redoing the road to my brother's place  for  almost  the
fifth time now. Then, as Public Works, we thought that we would do a  better
job and we got this special contractor to whom we said that we had  material
which could be used, and that the road could only be maintained  after  five
years.

I am sorry to say that the road deteriorated after  six  months.  In  Public
Works, I have said those people must never ever be given a  contract  again.
They have put themselves on the blacklist.

Another thing I must commend is the type of partnerships that we  have,  not
only with the private sector but also  the  working  relationships  that  we
have with other departments. The Department of  Labour  is  one  that  needs
mentioning. Whenever we have people who have to deal  with  construction  of
any kind, we insist that there should be training. Almost all the time,  the
Department of Labour helps us  with  that  type  of  training.  It  has  now
created a pool of people  with  some  kind  of  a  skill.  In  Hlabisa,  for
instance, we trained people for two projects that we are going  to  do,  and
when it came to the tarring of the road by a private company, all  of  those
people who had been trained for  the  building  of  the  schools  got  jobs,
because they had this particular type of training. So training is  paramount
in what we are doing in that it is the only gateway to make  sure  that  our
people will have some kind of a life.

The other thing I would like help with from the provinces  is  for  them  to
tell us if some of our projects are really white elephants so that we  could
change the use they are meant for. It is useless  pouring  Government  money
into something only  to  find  that,  after  two  years,  people  have  lost
interest, especially with regard to the community gardens. And then you  see
this patch of ground next to the river with a fence with nothing growing  on
the inside. For instance, we have built a lot  of  halls  because,  at  some
point in the past, it was the thing to do to build halls.
The truth of the matter is that people need multipurpose community  centres,
because they become one-stop-shop centres for everybody. You get  a  lot  of
services happening, with the elderly no longer having  to  borrow  money  to
travel 80km or 90km to the nearest dorp in order for them  to  register  for
old age pensions. Because of the improvement in communication, we even  have
systems now where, in your own community, you can  go  and  get  information
and even an application form for some of the jobs you would  like  to  apply
for. I don't want to take a long time, because you  were  all  helpful  with
the budget.

The last point I just want to raise is a simple one. I want to get the  MECs
to understand that, definitely, the next amount for  rates  and  taxes  will
come from the MTEF. They should  not  worry  about  that,  because  we  have
suggested that these should be devolved to  them,  and  it  should  come  to
them. I must express my thanks for the  enthusiasm  with  which  people  are
beginning to involve and encourage women in construction.

Ukwakha kwaqalwa ngoomama emakhaya besakha izitena.  [Building  was  started
by women when they made bricks.] I remember, as a kid, we would follow  oxen
... singene eludakeni sixove udaka ... [... and mix soil with water to  make
mud ... ] because people were going to make bricks.

If you sit there and watch carefully, some of the methods that were used  40
years back and were abandoned because we  thought  it  was  the  fashionable
thing to do to abandon them, are actually going to be the methods  that  are
once more going to enable people to be at work in the  various  communities.
So I am excited that the result  of  the  challenge  I  got  from  the  Port
Elizabeth women on a particular women's day is actually now a thing that  is
happening in the whole of South Africa, of having women in construction.

I must therefore thank you all for  such  a  comfortable  debate,  and  also
thank you for the visits that this House makes  to  the  various  provinces.
You don't just visit; you also furnish us with reports, and we take them  as
they are. We always believe that  even  where  there  is  criticism,  it  is
constructive criticism. Well,  the  Deputy  Minister  has  heard  about  ...
[Interjections.] We must be honest.  We  would  like  that  function  to  be
removed from Public Works' ambit. It is the transport function.  [Laughter.]
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                    ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES PROHIBITION BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  I  call  upon  the
Minister of Defence, Mr M G Lekota.

The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: Chairperson, I have a problem. I am  sorry  to
interrupt the business of the House, but I wanted  to  inform  you  that  we
have prepared a party where I stay in Gardens. There are  some  people  here
without transport. We will wait for them outside and provide transport  when
you are through with your programme. Thank you. [Applause.]
The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Deputy  Chairperson,  the  Bill  before  the  House
seeks to place our country  in  a  position  in  which  we  can  effect  the
ratification of the Mines Ban Treaty. I hasten to remind  the  members  that
... [Interjections.] This tray is very troublesome. [Laughter.] I'll  go  to
a different one.

I hasten to remind the members of the House  that  anti-personnel  landmines
were heavily used in the Cold War years and it was a very lethal weapon  for
liberation formations, whether it was  in  Africa,  Asia  or  Latin  America
where small, armed guerillas had to make the terrain very dangerous for  the
conventional armed forces that they were faced with.

Our region was no less itself a user of this instrument. Over  a  period  of
time, the study of landmines has shown that they are a terrible setback  for
the human race because the landmine - otherwise known as  an  anti-personnel
mine - has been described as a perfect soldier, undetected until it  is  too
late. It never misses, never sleeps and is  always  silent.  Because  it  is
activated by the victim, it is bound to do damage. Long  after  the  war  is
finished, that soldier is still at war. So even when peace  agreements  have
been signed, the anti-personnel mines are still there, determined  to  fight
a war that has been concluded. It is for that reason  that  nations  of  the
world, having considered the matter, agreed that it is important that  anti-
personnel mines should be eliminated.

I want to give you an example. If you were to consider the lifespan of  this
dreadful weapon, you would realise that it is often laid as  a  booby  trap.
It is put in place often in agricultural land  -  perhaps  along  a  road  -
usually by a terrified youngster or a guerilla who is rushing to hide  away.
Whoever puts it there cannot wait to get as much  distance  between  himself
and it because they are not even sure it is  not  going  take  their  lives.
Probably, whoever puts it there recalls the instructor  describing  what  it
can do. Even more probable is the possibility that he has seen the  amputees
or heard his comrades crying  out  in  pain,  alone  in  the  dark,  in  the
minefield were no one will dare to go to his or her assistance.

At a later stage, often years later,  there  is  an  explosion,  killing  or
maiming a child, who, on his or her  way  to  collecting  wood  or  fetching
water, looked at it curiously before trying to pick  it  up  or  unknowingly
runs along  a  track  before  stepping  on  it.  If  he  or  she  is  lucky,
temporarily blindness and perforated  ear  drums  might  occur  besides  the
sheer terror that they may suffer. You are lucky if that  happens.  Maybe  -
but not likely, more frequently - the  victim  must  trek  for  miles  to  a
clinic, if there are any in some rural areas where this  weapon  is  usually
located. In a rural area where there is unlikely  to  be  any  extra  blood,
probably few bandages and painkillers, the victim has very little chance  of
survival.

If he or she is lucky enough to survive, a prosthesis will  be  fitted,  but
the child will have to undergo surgery every three  to  six  months  as  the
bone continues to grow and causes great discomfort as  it  sticks  into  the
artificial limb. I do not exaggerate either the identity of the victim as  a
civilian or probably a child, nor can I even begin to  describe  the  terror
of these weapons sufficiently. The International Committee of the Red  Cross
reports that the only purpose for which mines  have  been  used  with  total
success by the mine-layer and with total impact on the  target  is  for  the
containment or harassment of civilians.

The main characteristic of a mine is that  it  is  designed  to  be  victim-
activated. Totally unprepared for the effects  of  mine  warfare,  civilians
suffer terribly. A shocking statistic is that one in 470  people  in  Angola
have had one or more limbs amputated  as  a  result  of  the  anti-personnel
mines. Even the shortest visit to many of our capital cities like Luanda  or
Maputo, or to rural areas in these countries of  Rwanda,  DRC,  or  Northern
Namibia reveals the successful strike of the mines. Everywhere you  go,  you
will see these individuals - youngsters, many of them maybe  only  in  their
early 20s, maimed for life.  They  are  everywhere  in  Luanda  and  in  the
cities. If you compare what you see there in a country like Angola with  the
statistics in a country like the United  States,  where  you  will  probably
find one out of 22 000 victims, you can see how  much  personnel  and  human
resources have been lost in that country as a result of landmines.

The International Committee of the  Red  Cross  states  that  these  weapons
currently claim some 2 000 victims a month and,  over  the  last  50  years,
have probably inflicted more deaths and injuries than nuclear  and  chemical
weapons combined. Landmines, which were originally conceived to counter  the
use of tanks and other armoured vehicles, have  been  increasingly  designed
to target human beings. The United Nations has reckoned that  landmines  are
at least ten times more  likely  to  kill  or  injure  a  civilian  after  a
conflict than a combatant  after  hostilities.  Combatants,  once  peace  is
signed, will cease to do anything.  Maybe  here  and  there,  some,  out  of
bitterness, will attack others. The landmines,  however,  will  continue  at
the same rate as if the war was continuing.

In 1996, we prohibited the export of all types of  landmines.  In  1997,  we
prohibited  the  use,  development,  production  and  stockpiling  of  anti-
personnel landmines. By 1998, some 312 000 anti-personnel landmines held  by
the Department of Defence had been destroyed. There is of  course  an  angle
to this issue. All the time, we train members of  the  SA  National  Defence
Force. We have to make sure that they remain familiar with the  know-how  of
this kind of weapon, because, if you send them out for  peace  missions  and
so on, they have to have the know-how to be able to deal with those  weapons
if they should encounter them.

South Africa has sought to operationalise the Mines Ban Treaty by  preparing
this Anti-Personnel Mines Prohibition Bill which is before the House  today.
Angola's recent ratification of the Mines Ban  Treaty  now  means  that  all
SADC countries are on board and under the umbrella of the  convention.  This
must now be taken forward by promulgating  domestic  legislation  and  penal
sanctions to give effect to the conventions.

South Africa's ratification  of  this  legislation  has  its  roots  in  the
international campaign to rid the world of anti-personnel landmines. I  must
say that these are many in type. For instance,  many  of  the  weapons  that
were raining down on Baghdad a few weeks back, have a similar effect. It  is
clear that the cluster bomb, in particular, acts in a very  similar  way  to
the anti-personnel landmines. They are small, scattered, silent and  objects
of curiosity to children. Governments, in  conjunction  with  their  defence
forces, have to actively revisit their military doctrine  to  eradicate  use
of these weapons. Governments also need to ensure that public  awareness  is
such that, if conflict breaks out, the use of mines or the  hacking  off  of
limbs is considered so repulsive that their  use  will  unconditionally  and
unanimously be condemned by all participants in such conflicts.

The focus of our immediate efforts should now be to rid the  SADC  community
and the region of the scourge  of  landmines.  Nepad's  peace  and  security
initiative focuses on building Africa's capacity to manage  all  aspects  of
conflict by strengthening existing  continental  and  regional  institutions
that deal, amongst other things, with combating  the  illicit  proliferation
of small arms, light weapons and landmines. We are playing  a  leading  role
in demining,  in  the  training  of  deminers  and  in  improving  the  cost
efficiency of operations.

When the South African Government  approved  the  restructuring  of  Mechem,
Denel's demining technology power  house,  it  insisted  that  the  demining
component would neither be shut down nor privatised,  precisely  because  it
is a critical component of humanitarian assistance that must not  be  driven
by profit. Local community participation and education are central  to  this
assistance. So presently, in our own region, we  have  become  an  important
resource for training young people and others  from  neighbouring  countries
so that they are able to go back and lead their communities in the  work  of
ridding the territory and terrain in which they grew up of these weapons.

We would also urge the wider demining industry to adopt a  code  of  conduct
that is respected and implemented  by  all.  South  Africa  remains  totally
committed to the anti-personnel  landmines  viewpoint,  the  destruction  of
existing stockpiles, mine awareness, the clearance  of  emplaced  mines  and
victim assistance. We would urge those countries which have not  yet  passed
legislation such as this Bill to do so urgently. Peace and security  in  the
region and on our continent must remain a top priority for South  Africa.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, in this Bill, we are  addressing  a  deadly
scourge that might be caused by anti-personnel  mines.  Our  Government  has
already signed and ratified the Convention on the Prohibition  of  the  Use,
Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines  and  on  their
Destruction.

Ke Mmušo wa batho wo o ka tšeyago kgato ya mohuta wo. Ke Mmušo wa  go  tšeya
gabotse wo o ka tšeyago kgato ya mohuta wo. Ke Mmušo wa kwelobohloko  wo  ka

National Congress wo o nago le lešoko baneng ba wona, o ka tšeyago kgato  ya
mohuta wo.

Ke ka baka leo re rego Mmušo wo etilwego  pele  ke  mokgatlo  wo  mogolo  wa
African National Congress, ga go na wo  swanago  le  wona.  (Translation  of
Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: It is only a people's  government  that  can  introduce
such measures. It is only  a  viable  government  that  can  introduce  such
measures. It is only  a  sympathetic  government  that  can  introduce  such
measures. It is only the great  ANC-led  Government,  which  is  sympathetic
towards its people, that can introduce such measures.

And that is why we say nothing compares to the great ANC-led Government.]

I hope this been driven through to my colleague, Bernice Sondedondering.

Chairperson,  anti-personnel  mines  are  dangerous;  they  maim,   destroy,
destruct  and  kill  innocent  and  defenceless   civilians.   Directly   or
indirectly, something had to be done to stop this. That is  the  reason  why
our  Government,  after  signing  the  convention,  directed  the   relevant
department to come up with this piece of legislation  -  the  Anti-Personnel
Mines Bill. This is the mandate given by the  UN  Secretary-General  to  all
countries that are signatories to this convention.

There is a belief by some  European  countries  that  many  of  our  African
states cannot practise  what  they  preach.  This  is  a  call  to  all  the
signatories: Let's prove them wrong!  This  piece  of  legislation  will  be
implementable, accessible, reasonable and relevant.

Let us for a moment think of our brothers and sisters whose limbs had to  be
amputated because of these anti-personnel mines. Let us think  of  the  many
precious lives that are lost because of these anti-personnel mines.  Let  us
think of those kids who are now  orphans  because  of  these  anti-personnel
mines. Again, let's think of those parents who are unable to  support  their
kids because of these anti-personnel mines. Let us think of  those  who  are
now confined to wheelchairs because  of  these  anti-personnel  mines.  Just
think of those pictures of people who are disfigured because of these  anti-
personnel mines. You are bound to be touched by them. For Heaven sake,  who,
in his or  her  sober  mind,  can  object  or  refuse  when  the  Government
prohibits, puts conditions on, controls or regulates the use of these  anti-
personnel mines? No one.

That is why this Bill makes it possible for perpetrators  to  be  prosecuted
by relevant courts. That is why there are measures to deal  with  those  who
go against the provision of this legislation.

To those who are still  in  possession  of  these  anti-personnel  mines,  a
brotherly piece of advice and warning is:  Please  come  out  willingly  and
voluntarily before our law enforcement agencies pounce upon you.

Local and international inspectors can,  for  example,  seize,  search,  and
destroy any item that might be undesirable or  dangerous  to  human  beings,
the environment or even property.

Chairperson, the evergreen and always alert  Select  Committee  on  Security
and  Constitutional  Affairs  detected  some  clauses   that   needed   some
amendments. We effected some  changes  to  clause  11(2).  That  clause  was
reformulated. The clause deals with a country that is  not  a  signatory  to
the convention on anti-personnel mines. The clause allows the Department  of
Defence  to  participate  in  operations,  exercises   or   other   military
activities with the armed forces of that particular state.  This  clause  in
its current form is ambiguous. What we are  bringing  in  is  that  if  that
other country that  is  not  a  signatory  to  the  convention  violates  or
contravenes any provision of this legislation, the Minister must  order  the
termination of  any  further  involvement  in  the  operation,  exercise  or
activity in question.

Members came up with their different formulations, as you will hear from  my
colleague, Mr Matthee. But, finally, we agreed that  the  formulation  which
we have proposed will  rule  supreme.  The  new  formulation  is  there  for
everyone to see.

On behalf of this wonderful, dynamic and calculating committee,  I  formally
put the amendment before the Council.

Chairperson, hon members, you don't want to know how  happy  the  department
was when we effected changes to clause 19 of this  Bill,  for  example.  The
anti-personnel mines are not only a spectre of doom to the  environment  and
people; they are also a danger to properties. Again, the committee  detected
that we needed to reformulate this clause. I'm  putting  this  new  proposal
again - the second one - before the Council.

Let me end by  thanking  my  colleagues  and  committee  members  for  their
unqualified support and dedication to this committee. I humbly  commend  the
Bill as amended to this Council for  adoption  or  approval.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chair, thank you very much. It is an  honour  to  follow  on
after my learned Chief and Chairperson of this committee.

Voorsitter, die doelstellings van hierdie wetsontwerp en die  konvensie,  of
MBT soos dit ook bekend staan, is reeds deur die Minister en ander  sprekers
genoem en bespreek. Ek sal dit darem nie herhaal nie.

Vir die Minister se inligting wil ek egter net  kortliks  noem  dat  hierdie
Huis vroeër vandag eenparig 'n besluit geneem het waarin dit  kennis  geneem
het van die feit dat soos op 9 Mei 2003 daar steeds 47  lande  was  wat  nog
nie die Konvensie geteken het nie en 'n beroep op daardie lande  gedoen  het
om dit nou te oorweeg om dit so gou  as  moontlik  te  doen.  Dit  is  nogal
ontstellend om te sien dat lande soos China, Kuba, Egipte,  Finland,  Indië,
Pakistan, Rusland en die Verenigde State van Amerika onder die lande is  wat
tot op datum nog nie geteken het nie. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Chairperson, the objectives of this Bill and the convention, or MBT, as  it
is also known, have already been mentioned and  discussed  by  the  Minister
and other speakers. At least I shall not repeat that.

For the hon the Minister's information, however,  I  just  want  to  mention
briefly that this House unanimously proposed a resolution earlier  today  in
which it took note of the fact that as at 9 May 2003  there  were  still  47
countries which had not yet ratified the convention, and appealed  to  those
countries now to consider  doing  so  as  soon  as  possible.  It  is  quite
disconcerting to see that countries such as  China,  Cuba,  Egypt,  Finland,
India, Pakistan, Russia and the United States of  America  are  amongst  the
countries which have not yet signed.]

In respect of the Bill itself and the report of the  committee,  I  wish  to
refer you to clause 11. I wish to state that I am  in  full  agreement  with
the proposed amendment by the committee in the report.

I did, however, indicate at the committee meeting that I was of the  opinion
that, in the light of the proposed amendment, it was necessary to include  a
further sentence or subclause to the following effect: that,  in  the  event
of the Minister not ordering the termination of any further  involvement  in
the operation, exercise or activity in question, the Minister may take  such
other appropriate action as he or she may deem necessary.

I argued that the Minister should be in a position where he can  exercise  a
discretion to, for example, require certain  undertakings  from  such  armed
forces or state and/or that certain measures be introduced  to  prevent  the
recurrence of such contravention and/or to set certain further conditions.

Although Mr Maloyi agreed with me, my  hon  chair  and  Chief  who  normally
follows my legal advice ... [Laughter] ... this time decided, for some  very
unknown reason, to  rather  agree  with  the  state  law  advisers  and  the
department that this proposal would still render the clause a  contradiction
in terms. I unfortunately  did  not  pursue  the  matter  any  further  then
because, you know, the chairperson is  not  just  the  chairperson,  but  of
course also my Chief. And when the Chief has spoken, one should  keep  quiet
after that.

But afterwards, I again discussed this with the  legal  adviser  who,  after
further explanation by me, and I don't want to bind  him,  seemed  to  agree
with me. On reflection, I still think that my proposal is sound as  it  does
not create a contradiction in terms and  it  will  put  the  Minister  in  a
position where he can act in the best interests of  our  Defence  Force  and
country, taking into account the specific circumstances  pertaining  at  the
time. I will therefore also make these remarks  of  mine  available  to  the
Portfolio Committee on Defence when they again consider the Bill.

Chair, it is abundantly clear from the wealth of  information  contained  in
the Landmine Monitor Report of 2002 that the Mines Ban Treaty  and  the  Ban
Movement more generally are making tremendous strides in  eradicating  anti-
personnel landmines and in saving lives and limbs in  every  region  of  the
world.

This progress is inter alia shown by widespread international  rejection  of
any use or possession of anti-personnel mines; cessation of mine use in  key
countries; mine use is halted, at least temporarily,  in  several  countries
where it has been most widespread in recent years. In Angola, for  instance,
there has been no use since the April  2002  Peace  Agreement.  Eritrea  and
Ethiopia have had no use since the end of the border conflict in June  2000.
In Sri Lanka there was no use since the ceasefire in 2001.

There are dramatic reductions in anti-personnel mine stockpiles.  More  than
34 million anti-personnel mines have been destroyed by 61 states,  including
some 7 million in the reporting period from May 2001 to mid-2002. There  are
fewer new mine victims. Landmine monitors' ever more  detailed  research  on
landmine casualties confirmed that the estimated number of new landmine  and
unexploded ordnance casualties are now between 15 000 and 20 000  per  year.
This represents a significant reduction in the  long-standing  and  commonly
cited estimate of 26 000 new casualties each year.  Mine  action  programmes
have been expanded tremendously.

There have, however, unfortunately also been key concerns emerging from  the
said report. Since late December 2001, India  and  Pakistan  ...  Thank  you
very much. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

(Translation of isiZulu speech follows.)

[Prince B Z ZULU: Thank you, Chairperson. Hon Minister and hon  members,  on
8 September 1997 South Africa signed the agreement on the prevention of  the
use and the keeping of bombs in  an  illegal  manner.  This  agreement  also
prevents the transfer of explosive devices to  others  illegally.  The  Bill
gives the Minister the authority to  appoint  someone  to  investigate  when
there are suspicions of this agreement being violated.

It also  allows  the  SANDF  to  be  able  to  use  its  structures  without
interfering in the agreement and giving the General-Secretary of the UN  the
right to come to South Africa and conduct a search if there  are  suspicions
of a violation of this agreement.

The whole world looks unhappy about these bombs that have  been  taking  the
lives of many for a long time. That is the reason  why  the  governments  of
the nations signed an agreement that prevents the  spread  of  bombs  in  an
unnecessary manner. Therefore, the aim of the proposed Bill is to  stop  the
injuring and victimisation as well as the  deaths  of  thousands  of  people
that take place on a daily basis.

People  who  are  killed  by  these  bombs  are  innocent  and  defenceless,
especially the women and children. A country that is damaged by bombs has  a
sick economy. Even development is paralysed. What is left  in  that  country
is crisis and great poverty. The economy of the country that  was  built  on
people's sweat  disappears  within  a  second  after  it  has  been  bombed.
Therefore the Department of Defence  has  an  important  role  to  play  and
should face the international  challenge,  that  of  passing  the  law  that
prevents the use of bombs.

It is quite important that the governments of the world  give  their  people
the assurance that they are safe, by passing  laws  and  signing  agreements
that regulate the use of bombs in a proper manner. We  greatly  support  the
attempts by the International Red Cross to campaign  for  the  abolition  of
anti-personnel mines.

Therefore we as the ANC support this Bill. [Applause.]]

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, hon Minister,  and  hon  members,  the  preceding
speakers have dealt comprehensively with the issues at hand. I am not  going
to repeat everything, but certain things do need to be emphasised.

In the debate on Anti-Personnel Mines, the moral issues have to  be  at  the
forefront. You cannot ignore what we have all  seen:  the  destroyed  lives,
the destroyed and shattered futures, especially of  the  children,  many  of
whom have been the tragic victims of these weapons.

We also have to note that in  developing  countries,  as  the  hon  Minister
pointed out, many of these weapons are placed in  agricultural  fields,  and
communities, especially those of subsistence farmers, are thereby robbed  of
their ability to make a living. These  facts  have  to  be  brought  to  the
forefront.

I think and I submit, hon Minister, as  South  Africans,  we  can  all  feel
justifiably proud that we have signed and acceded to the treaty and that  we
have brought this Bill to Parliament in the way that we  have,  as  well  as
the fact that our parastatals and private companies are at the forefront  in
clearing areas which, in the recent  and  not  so  recent  past,  have  been
wracked by conflict involving these terrible weapons.

This Bill deserves the unanimous support of all parties in this House and  I
am pleased to say that the DA supports this Bill. I thank you.

Mr B J MKHALIPHI: Hon members, hon Minister, and  Chairperson,  there  is  a
saying that states: ``Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown''.  This  is
especially the case when  that  crown  is  illegitimately  acquired.  It  is
usually in such circumstances that some regimes  cordon  themselves  off  by
means of land mines. This is also the case with some armed bandits  in  some
countries. We have seen that in some countries in Africa.

Surrounding their country with trenches filled with highly  inflammable  oil
did not save Iraq from invasion; neither did the bombing air raids  on  Iraq
by the Bush regime and his accomplices topple Saddam Hussein,  but  what  is
absolutely clear is that they  lost  the  greater  war.  Looting,  violence,
lawlessness, and loss of economic activity are evidence that  the  bombs  by
Bush and company did not win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.

The Bill in front of us this afternoon is a practical action to give  effect
to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Anti-Personnel mines in  any  of
the one-party states, with  certain  exceptions.  Among  other  issues,  the
committee  deliberated  on  clause  11  of  the  Bill.  Initially  we   were
concerned, hon Minister, about the participation of  our  Defence  Force  in
operations, exercises, or any other military activities  with  armed  forces
of a state which is not a signatory to the convention.

Some of us were contending that  such  activities  may  compromise  or  even
discredit the moral high ground envisaged by this  convention.  However,  we
eventually agreed that the  participation  of  our  Defence  Force  in  such
activities can serve as a practical coercion of those  states  to  seriously
appreciate and eventually sign the convention.

In that spirit, hon Minister, I will be  really  disappointed  if  countries
such as the DRC and others who are involved in conflict  are  still  outside
of this convention. Even so, our Defence Force will still need  to  maintain
a very intricate  balancing  act  if  it  is  to  remain  untainted  by  its
participation in any military activities in a nonsignatory state.

Perhaps we need to take a cue from a slogan of a certain insurance  company.
The slogan goes like this: ``When your reputation  is  at  stake,  integrity
bails you out.''

By approving this piece of legislation in front of  us  this  afternoon,  we
will be displaying the best character of the greatest  movement  of  all  in
Africa - that of the ANC. This has been  the  tradition  in  the  ANC.  Even
during the difficult times of the armed  struggle,  their  leadership  would
make the point that, despite their own destitute state  of  deprivation  and
oppression, they would support other suffering people on the  continent  and
everywhere else in the world. We, therefore,  support  this  Bill  entirely.
Thank you. [Applause.]

THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Chairperson, thank  you  very  much.  I  must
immediately express my gratitude for the observations and contributions  the
members have made.

I am happy that the House has drawn our attention to  section  11.  It  says
that the Department of Defence may participate in operations, exercises,  or
other military activities with the armed forces of a state  that  is  not  a
party  to  the  convention.  I'm  looking  at  subsection  2.  If   such   a
contravention occurs,  the  Minister  must  order  the  termination  of  any
further involvement in the operation, exercise,  or  activity  in  question.
Now, that is too peremptory. At  any  time  that  we  are  interacting  with
another country in military exercises, and so on, there would ordinarily  be
an existing memorandum of understanding for these countries  to  co-operate,
to strengthen their relations, and so on. If it was to be found  that  there
was a contravention of one of the other laws of  the  country,  I  think  we
would not want to start by terminating the exercise.

We would want to start by searching for ways of correcting the other  party.
And only if there was a point of no agreement would we then say  well,  here
is a parting of the ways because the law of our land is as follows.

So I'm happy to accept  the  suggestion  from  the  House  that  if  such  a
contravention occurs, the Minister may - instead of  ``must''  -  order  the
termination of any further involvement  in  the  operation  or  exercise  or
activity in question. He may do so. There is a lot of writing that has  been
done here. The second part, I thought, should  read:  ``or  must  take  such
action, other than these options which are here.'' It  is  appropriate  that
the Minister be given the right or the power to take any other  action  that
is not suggested  here.  So  we  should  retain  it  to  say  ``activity  in
question'' or ``must take such appropriate action as  he  or  she  may  deem
necessary''. In that way, I think that that will improve  it  and  I  accept
that perhaps, in the adoption, in the declarations in the  House,  adopt  it
in that form. Madam Chair, we would be happy about that.

Now I have already thanked the House for various  other  observations  which
have been made and I do need to say, before I end my  comments,  that  South
Africa is playing a critical role on the continent and around the world.  We
are setting the pace in various aspects. In  this  area  of  the  Mines  Ban
Treaty, persuading  other  countries  to  fall  in  line  with  multilateral
treaties, we carry the  responsibility  to  provide  ongoing  leadership.  I
think it is important that we take note of the countries that  have  not  as
yet ratified the treaty. In our bilateral relations, in our engagement  with
them in various fora, whether it's the Non-Aligned Movement or  the  African
Union and so on, we engage them and we place pressure  on  them  and  reason
with them about why it is vital for them to come on board  to  ratify  these
treaties reached under the United Nations. Here, too,  apart  from  our  own
ratification, we have an international task to continue to engage  these  97
countries, with a view to persuading them to fall in line.

I can promise members here that when we are in executive functions, we  will
be doing this. There are also interactions where members  of  the  House  in
committees visit other countries, and in the discussions that go  on  there,
it's critical that, there too, members identify issues of  this  nature.  In
their interactions with their counterparts, visiting committees and  so  on,
they should raise these issues and  express  them  with  the  South  African
spirit and attitude on these questions.

I know that the Chief Whip has advised me that  I've  got  another  hour  in
which to address you  but,  as  I've  said  before,  I  know  that  I'm  not
compelled to speak for an hour.  I  will  therefore  terminate  my  comments
here. I thank you. [Applause].

Debate concluded.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I shall now put the  question.  The  question
is that the Bill, subject to the proposed amendments  by  the  committee  be
agreed to.

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Chairperson with respect, you  haven't  given
the parties an opportunity  to  make  a  declaration,  given  what  the  hon
Minister has said. We would like to commend him for his quickness  of  mind.
I think a statement would be appropriate  and,  if  permission  is  granted,
could I, on behalf of the ANC,  make  such  a  statement?  Do  I  have  your
permission? Thank you very much, Chairperson.

Chairperson, I agree and concur fully with the hon Minister for his  drawing
the attention of this House to the inconsistency in  terms  of  the  way  in
which this clause is set out.

I certainly support the proposal, but may I just suggest a slight  amendment
to the proposal in  terms  of  line  35.  We  should  be  grateful  for  the
technology we have before us which allows us to look at  the  provision  and
the words that must be omitted, as suggested by the hon  Minister.  In  line
36, rather than including the word ``must'', delete  the  word  ``may''.  So
you simply state, if I could read it for the benefit of the House:


  If such contravention occurs, the Minister may order the  termination  of
  any further  involvement  in  the  operation,  exercise  or  activity  in
  question, or take such other  appropriate  action,  as  he/she  may  deem
  necessary.

It would have exactly the same effect. I  also  propose,  Chairperson,  that
under the circumstances, the proposed amendment with the suggestion  of  the
hon Minister be conveyed to the other House by this  Council  in  order  for
attention to be drawn to the important comments that have been made  by  the
hon Minister. I thank you, Chairperson.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, Chief  Whip.  The  Rules
of this House do  allow  members  of  the  select  committee  to  make  such
amendments to the portfolio committee. Maybe it is the role  of  the  Select
Committee to recommend that, on behalf of this Council, to our  counterparts
in the National Assembly but  at  the  moment  we  will  pass  the  Bill  as
amended. Mr Matthee, I saw your hand.

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson,  may  I  be  allowed,  on  behalf  of  the  New
National Party, to make a declaration? I would then like to say that I'm  in
full agreement with the Chief Whip, as the amendment that  he  has  proposed
takes care of exactly what I set out  in  my  speech.  It  is  just  put  in
another way but it is exactly the same. So, the NNP would agree to that.

Prince B Z ZULU: Thank you, Chairperson. I'm rising to indicate that  we  do
not have any problems in terms of the amendments that have to  be  effected,
provided that those amendments actually  do  not  fundamentally  change  the
entire intention of the Bill. Thanks.

Mr L G LEVER:  Chair,  in  the  committee,  it  was  pointed  out  that  the
difficulty with the original formulation of  this  subclause  was  that  the
``must'' contradicted with the discretion that was given to the Minister  in
the later phrase in that subclause. So the original  proposal  was  that  we
should change that ``must'' to ``may'', and I'm in full agreement  with  the
Chief Whip's proposal.
I do also express sympathy with the view  expressed  by  the  hon  Mkhaliphi
that if we are heading for this type of thing, morally, we would like to  be
seen as sticking to our guns. But still, I do understand the  point  and  am
willing to concede the point, hon Minister, in that manner.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you very much, Mr Lever. I  think  what
has to happen is that, as the declarations have  been  made,  the  Committee
still has the right to deal with the Bill and amend it, and  make  proposals
to the portfolio committee in the National Assembly.

Kgoshi M  L  MOKOENA:  Chairperson,  the  committee  has  drafted  this  new
formulation. What we are hearing now are just changes in semantics,  but  we
have done the proposals already and it is already  with  our  colleagues  on
the other side. I rest my case.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 17:55.
