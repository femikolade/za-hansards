                             APPROPRIATION BILL

Resumption of debate on Vote No 1 - The Presidency:

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: Madam Speaker and hon members, first of all
I'd like to thank you for your good wishes on the occasion of my birthday
yesterday. In this regard, I'd also like to express the resolve of all of
us in Government, the resolve that we share, that as long as we are charged
with the responsibilities we carry as the national Government of our
country, we will continue to use all our energies honestly to serve the
people of South Africa to the best of our abilities.

In this regard I would agree fully with the hon Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi
that -


  ... our people need the full measure of attention which our Government
  can give to them and we hope that the Presidency will be able to provide
  its tested and strong leadership to move the country forward on the path
  of development at a much faster pace and on the basis of a vision which
  allows us to draw value from being Africans born and bred in the unique
  country of South Africa.

I'm certain that the occasion of the debates on the various Budget Votes of
the various departments gave this House the opportunity to assess whether
the Government is responding to this call to give our people the full
measure of attention they need.

Yesterday and at other times in the past, in this House  and  elsewhere,  we
have sought to emphasise the fact that indeed the Government has decided  to
pay particular attention to the effective implementation of the policies  we
have adopted. We are doing this and we will continue to do so.

The hon Mr Ditshetelo said our effectiveness in this regard  is  compromised
by the fact, as he put it, that -


  ... we simply think he is preoccupied ...

That is, the President -


  ... with issues that are hundreds of miles away from home. We say charity
  begins at home ... The perception among ordinary South Africans  is  that
  our President does not care nor has the time to listen  to  their  cries.
  This is a reality we cannot simply ignore, it is informed by our people's
  daily experiences.

I'm afraid I do not agree. Obviously the hon member and I talk to  different
South  Africans.  [Applause.]  But  beyond  this  we  will  continue  to  be
preoccupied with issues that are hundreds  of  miles  away  from  home.  I'm
certain that we  have  no  choice  in  this  matter,  unless  we  decide  to
extricate ourselves from the process of globalisation, lose interest in  the
development of the rest of our continent and -abandon a  value  system  that
has characterised our struggle and  movement  for  national  liberation  for
many  decades  -  a  value  system  informed  by  international  and   human
solidarity, the solidarity  that  played  such  an  important  part  in  our
national effort to end the system of apartheid.

South Africa is linked to the rest of Africa and the world at large in  many
ways. We are not a small village stuck away in the middle of  nowhere  which
the world passes by and which does not even know that the rest of the  world
exists. We do not support the  notion  that  our  country  can  develop  and
emerge as a winning nation on the basis of its isolation from  the  rest  of
the world. The issues that are hundreds of miles away from  home,  to  which
the hon member refers, are very directly relevant to whether we  succeed  in
the effort to transform ourselves into a winning nation.

It may also be that some among us are unaware of the value that many in  the
world attach to the contribution of our country and people to  the  solution
of the problems that confront humanity  as  a  whole.  Apart  from  anything
else, this makes  it  necessary  for  all  our  people,  and  not  just  the
Government, to respond to this high international  level  of  confidence  in
our country's capacity to contribute something valuable to  the  improvement
of the human condition.

It  would  be  incorrect   to   walk   away   from   this   obligation   and
uncharacteristic of us as a people that  is  very  conscious  of  the  inner
sense of the concept of Ubuntu and the oneness of all  humanity.  We  should
not build a Chinese Wall between what is domestic and what  is  foreign  and
present a false dichotomy between what is  done  at  home  and  what  we  do
abroad. Immediately we cannot separate our destiny from the destiny  of  the
rest of our continent.

At the same time, we understand fully that  we  can  best  contribute  to  a
successful  African  Renaissance  if  we  succeed  in  the   task   of   the
reconstruction and development of our own country. Indeed, it  is  precisely
because of the advances we are making in this regard that so many in  Africa
and the rest of the world value our country's participation  in  the  global
effort to confront the common challenges.

The hon Dr Pieter Mulder said:


  According to some political commentators, two factors are causing all the
  problems in Africa: diversity and a refusal to tolerate dissent.

I can think of other reasons for all the problems in Africa, poverty and
underdevelopment being central among them, which, among other things, lead
to an intense struggle for limited resources. But, of course, I'm not a
political commentator. [Laughter.]

Nevertheless we fully recognise the importance of diversity and tolerance
of dissent in the overall process to transform both our country and the
rest of our continent. Other hon members also correctly drew attention to
the important issue of the diversity that characterises our country and
sought to suggest what we should do to respond to it, respecting the
necessary diversity of views in this regard.

But I believe that an important starting point in this regard is the
approach taken by such hon members as Renier Schoeman and Annelizé van Wyk,
among others. As hon members will recall, the hon Renier Schoeman said:


  While being mindful of and sensitive to the pain and suffering and
  conflict of the past, and even of the present, I can, irrespective of my
  own past, play my full role in every way I can, to help build a South
  Africa that is caring and worthwhile and a better place for all its
  people ... I must not only be proudly South African but I must also want
  this country to succeed and to play its rightful role in our continent
  ... I must be part of an individual and a collective effort to actually
  make it succeed.

The hon Annelizé van Wyk said:


  I believe that the challenge now is to live for our country ... South
  Africa and her people need us now. It needs all our talents, our
  commitment, our love and passion. We need to live for our country. We
  need to live for South Africa. That is the highest sacrifice we can now
  make.

I believe that if we heed the advice of these hon members, we will be able
to do what the hon Cassie Aucamp pledged his party to do, to play its part
positively to address our challenges and solve our problems.
The difficulties we face were highlighted in an article that appeared in
one of the weekend newspapers this past Sunday. In this article, Prof
Amanda Gouws, head of the political studies department at the University of
Stellenbosch, discusses the attitudes of students at Stellenbosch to the
challenge of national reconciliation. Among other things, she says:


  What do we say to white students who claim  they  are  too  young  to  be
  responsible for apartheid injustices?


  I hear this regularly in my politics classes. For many black students of
  the same age, the wounds of apartheid still hurt, but because they are in
  a minority in the classroom, the debate about reconciliation is always
  uneven and acrimonious.


  Collective guilt is difficult to explain to students who do not want to
  engage with apartheid history any more. They believe reconciliation is a
  ``feel-good concept''. They think the truth came out during the TRC
  process, that victims have forgiven the perpetrators and that we now all
  live happily ever after.


  To them the socioeconomic dimension of reconciliation smacks of reverse
  discrimination where they have to ``pay the price for political decisions
  they were not involved in''.


  We have not yet moved beyond the politics of the past where we can have
  open debates about the past and where students can formulate their own
  position on reconciliation. Transformation is still viewed as something
  ``imposed from above'' ...


  The problem is that the university is still ``the host'' welcoming ``the
  other'' to an institutional culture where minority students have to
  accept the rules of an existing culture. Thus group politics, as they
  were in the past, remain the prevailing strategy.


  Interests are therefore defined in racial terms and not across racial
  boundaries. ... Students have not progressed beyond the us/them divide -
  clearly because white and black students do not share the same interests
  and have not developed a collective voice. Reconciliation is the status
  quo.


  A consequence of this perception of reconciliation is that white students
  can remain passive - they have to do nothing to change the status quo -
  while black students have to be politically engaged to change it ...


  Thus the challenge remains: How can reconciliation be brought down to the
  grass-roots level?

I have quoted Prof Gouws at some length because of the important matters
she raises. I am convinced that all those among us who are genuinely
interested in national reconciliation, ready to respond to the challenges
our country faces in the manner suggested by the hon members Renier
Schoeman, Annelizé van Wyk, Cassie Aucamp and others, should study Prof
Gouws's honest and frank observations with great attention.

Those of us who care to know the truth, as she has sought to establish it,
know that what she describes is not peculiar to the University of
Stellenbosch or merely to students. It describes a situation that continues
to prevail throughout our society. Indeed, I have heard the sentiments
espoused by the students expressed in this very House with great passion
and conviction.
I must confess that I also liberally quoted Prof Gouws because if I or
others had made the same observations as she does, we would have been
accused of playing the race card, as the saying goes ... [Applause.] ...
signalling that those we seek to address have decided to close their ears
and minds to what we seek to communicate.

This matter came up even yesterday. For example, the hon Tony Leon said:


  But it is on President Mbeki's watch that South Africa has moved from the
  politics of the rainbow nation and reconciliation to the politics of race-
  labelling and race-baiting.

And as Prof Gouws said:


  Reconciliation is the status quo. A consequence of this perception of
  reconciliation is that white students can remain passive - they have to
  do nothing to change the status quo - while black students have to be
  politically engaged to change it ...

[Applause.]
  Thus the challenge remains: How can reconciliation be brought down to the
  grass-roots level?

And I would add, ``including the parliamentary grass roots''. [Applause.]

The struggle against racism will be with us for a long time. This is
because the racist legacy of colonialism and apartheid will be with us for
a long time. Neither I nor any other member of Government draws any joy
from this reality.

We who have known racism for countless generations would shout in great
jubilation if one day it could be said that the scourge of racism in our
country and the world is no more. When we speak of racism and racial
stereotypes we do so because we know the hurt caused to those who are the
victims of racism.

As long as we suffer this hurt, so long will we continue to fight to defeat
that which hurts millions. There are some among us who are keen that we
should say nothing about the hurt we feel. They treat our continuing
struggle against racism both as the very denial of national reconciliation
and as a deceitful political manoeuvre to achieve short-term partisan
political gains.

When we speak of the hurt that affects millions, a few tell us that we are
neither entitled to feel such hurt nor allowed to state what we feel. My
advice to these is that they should desist from telling us what to feel, to
think and to say. [Applause.] I'd like to advise them that we fought for
our liberation precisely because we refused that anybody should tell us
what to feel, to think and to say. [Applause.]

We did not achieve liberation in order to perpetuate a master-servant
relationship in our country. In this regard, let me make this matter clear
once and for all ... [Interjections.] ... there is nobody in our country
... [Interjections.]

The SPEAKER: Order! Order! [Interjections.]

The PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC: In this regard, Madam Speaker,  let  me  make
this matter very clear once and for all, there is nobody in our  country  or
anywhere in the world who is going to stop us from  confronting  the  cancer
of racism and continuing the struggle to build  a  nonracial  South  Africa.
[Interjections.] [Applause.]

There is nobody in our country or anywhere else in the world who will
succeed in convincing us that what we should feel, think and say is what
they tell us to feel, think and say. [Applause.] The repeated charge that
we are playing the so-called race card is not going to deter us from
continuing the struggle to defeat racism. [Applause.]

Between me and some of my white compatriots there is a great divide, a
chasm, on the issue of racism, in the manner described by Prof Amanda
Gouws. They do not like any reference to the issue of racism, perhaps
because they want to forget the past. On the other hand, we neither want to
nor will forget the past.

These white compatriots argue that to advance national reconciliation, we
must end the struggle against racism. We disagree. Persisting racism and
racial disparities in our country constitute an obstacle to the achievement
of the goal of national reconciliation.

Precisely because we seek and value national reconciliation, we will
continue the struggle against racism. I've even heard it said that the
transformation process in which we are engaged is inimical to the goal of
national reconciliation.

Even Madiba's name is dragooned into this argument. Thus he is presented as
the great proponent of a process of national reconciliation consisting of a
rainbow nation, minus the central element of transformation to which Prof
Gouws referred when she wrote: ``Reconciliation is the status quo''.

The white compatriots to whom I have referred say that apartheid is a thing
of the past, and that to refer to it is to pull the country backwards. We
disagree. Any denial of the past and its impact on the present would make
it impossible for us to focus on the real problems facing our people, which
are problems arising from the legacy of colonialism and apartheid.

These white compatriots accuse us of racism when we talk about racism and
expect us to heed what they are saying. When they speak of racism, shifting
the blame onto the victim, they expect that we should keep quiet even as
they give themselves the right to speak. In other words, they communicate
the direct message that they have a right to set the national agenda and we
have a duty to accept that agenda.

Prof Gouws has said that in the classrooms of Stellenbosch, ``the debate
about reconciliation is always uneven and acrimonious''. In the context of
the situation we have sought to describe, this debate will be uneven and
acrimonious in this House and elsewhere in our country as long as the
situation persists that some among us treat the views of those who know
what racism means with disdain and do not heed the call made by the hon Dr
Pieter Mulder for all of us to tolerate divergent views. [Interjections.]

Fortunately, there are many in our country, both black and white, who
understand very well that reconciliation is not just a ``feel-good
concept'', that the finalisation of the work of the TRC did not end the
need to strive for reconciliation, that reconciliation is not, and cannot
be, the status quo. This was demonstrated yesterday in the important
statements made in this House on this matter by both black and white
members of Parliament. It was illustrated by the presence in the House of
the young people, both black and white - the great achievers who yearn for
the new and reconciled South Africa, born out of the process of
transformation.

It is on these South Africans that our country will continue to depend for
the success of the twin processes of transformation and national
reconciliation. Accordingly, I would answer the question that Prof Gouws
posed by saying that reconciliation is being brought down to grass-roots
level!

Perhaps the question we should ask is: What more should we do to speed up
the process of ensuring that national reconciliation reaches more of our
people, resulting in the engagement of our challenges in the manner
indicated by the hon members Renier Schoeman, Annelizé van Wyk and Cassie
Aucamp?

It seems clear to me that there are some in our country who are not ready
to respond to the call made by these hon members, who neither accept that
our country must go through a process of fundamental transformation nor see
a role for themselves as active and conscious participants in the historic
process to achieve true national reconciliation among our people.

However loud their voices, we should not treat them as though they
constitute the determining factor with regard to the future of our country,
because they are not. We should leave them to go their merry way to fish to
their hearts' content for corrupt men.

Today 90 years ago, the then parliament of our country passed the 1913 Land
Act. As the hon Manie Schoeman said yesterday, ``it is right that we
continue to focus on this contentious issue'' of land, which he correctly
described as an ``emotional issue''.

While agreeing with the hon Manie Schoeman that we need to move forward
faster, we can say without hesitation that we have made a good beginning as
we continue to focus on this contentious matter. Of great importance is the
fact that our country has not been torn apart in a violent conflict to
address the land issue, even though the process of land dispossession
through the centuries was accompanied by unequalled violence.

That we have moved forward as peacefully as we have is a tribute to all our
people, including the white farmers. If we need any example to show what we
as South Africans, both black and white, can do to transform our country,
heal the wounds of the past and achieve national reconciliation, we need
look no further.

The overwhelming majority of hon members and parties that spoke yesterday
conveyed a message of hope about the future of our country and people. I am
certain that the masses of our people were inspired to hear those voices of
hope, as we were. For this I would like to thank the hon members very
sincerely. We will continue to study their statements to see how we should
respond to the many suggestions that were made.

However, I should also make the point that it is less than becoming that
some hon members abuse the privilege of being members of this House by
spreading falsehoods, as did the hon Rev Meshoe when he spoke about an
entirely nonexistent ``attempt by Government to remove Christmas and Good
Friday from our calendar'', to use his words. [Interjections.]

The hon Manie Schoeman ended his statement with the following words:


  We are privileged to live in this wonderful country at this point in our
  history. Like the proverbial rocket, ready to be launched into space, the
  countdown has begun - in fact, we are already in the lift-off phase.
  Black and white are taking hands to ensure the success of our mission.
  Indeed, success is assured.

I thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        SUSPENSION OF RULE 110 (2)(b)

                             (Draft Resolution)

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, I move the motion
printed in my name on the Order Paper, as follows:


  That the House suspends Rule 110(2)(b) in regard to the week of 23 to 27
  June 2003 in order to enable the Deputy President to answer Questions in
  both the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces during
  the same week.

Agreed to.

            CONDOLENCES ON DEATH OF LEADING SPORTS ADMINISTRATOR

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms H M MPAKA (ANC): Madam Speaker, the ANC is saddened by the news of the
untimely passing away of a leading sports administrator Kididimetse Tshoma,
who died on Tuesday 18 June 2003, after suffering a stroke. Kididimetse's
involvement in South Africa's sports movement stretches as far back as
1981. She served South African sport in various capacities, including
amongst others being President of the Soweto Cricket Club, chairperson of
the women's committee of Safa, chairperson of the Sports and Recreation
Distribution Agency of the National Lottery Trust Fund, executive member of
the National Sports Council and Nocsa Women's Commission.

This former educator, a recipient of the Presidential Sports Award will
also be remembered for her selfless efforts at securing and distributing
sports equipment in previously disadvantaged communities. The ANC expresses
its heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. [Applause.]

                        BY-ELECTIONS IN STELLENBOSCH

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr F J VAN DEVENTER (DA): Geagte Adjunkspeaker, die uitslag in die twee
tussenverkiesings op 18 Junie 2003 in Stellenbosch is 'n sprekende bewys
dat die kiesers hulle nie deur die ANC gaan laat intimideer om sy
koalisievennoot, die Nuwe NP, kunsmatig aan die lewe te hou nie. Met sy
oorwinning in Wyk 5 waar die DA 62,4% stemme gekry het en sy buitengewone
goeie vertoning in Wyk 12, waar die DA met slegs vier stemme teen die ANC
verloor het en die Nuwe NP gerieflik geklop het, het die DA hom verder
gevestig as groeiende alternatief vir die ANC. [Tussenwerpsels.]

Tweedens bevestig dit die kiesers se ondubbelsinnige keuse vir 'n
lewenskragtige veelpartydemokrasie bo 'n gemanipuleerde skoothonddemokrasie
soos wat hulle gebied word deur die ANC-Nuwe NP-koalisie. Dié koalisie se
blufspel kan nie langer ten koste van waardevolle veelpartydemokrasie
geduld word nie. Die DA bedank die kiesers van Stellenbosch vir hulle
oordeelkundige ondersteuning en is oortuig daarvan dat kiesers oor die hele
Suid-Afrika dieselfde standpunt huldig. [Applous.] (Translation of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr F J VAN DEVENTER (DA): Hon Deputy Speaker, the results of the two by-
elections which took place in Stellenbosch on 18 June 2003, are striking
proof that the voters will not allow themselves to be intimidated by the
ANC to keep its coalition partner, the New NP, artificially alive. With its
victory in Ward 5, where the DA polled 62,4% of the votes, and its
exceptionally good showing in Ward 12, where the DA only lost to the ANC by
four votes and comfortably defeated the New NP, the DA further established
itself as a growing alternative to the ANC. [Interjections.]

Secondly, this confirms the voters' unequivocal preference for a vigorous
multiparty democracy rather than a manipulated lapdog democracy, which is
what they are offered by the ANC-New NP coalition. The posturing of the
coalition can no longer be tolerated at the expense of valuable multiparty
democracy. The DA thanks the voters of Stellenbosch for their discerning
support, and is convinced that voters throughout South Africa hold the same
point of view. [Applause.]]

                       WOMAN GANG-RAPED FOR AIDS CURE

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr R RABINOWITZ (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, a few weeks ago a woman was
raped throughout the night by six men who told her she would cure them of
Aids. A week later no one in the library or corridors of Parliament I
approached had even heard of the incident. What does this say about our
response to this barbarous, distorted truth that flourishes concerning
Aids, making young women statistics in the spate of gang rapes.

The IFP proposes that the President, Deputy President, Minister of Health
and Sanec take off their blindfold and respond to the pleas of all those
calling for a fundamental change in Government's approach to Aids. We must
remove the element of secrecy and shame, stop anonymous testing, make
testing free and expand its scope, tell people their results, counsel those
who are positive and offer them treatment, introduce a law that gives
rapists a different reality from the madness we appear to shrug off. We
must make it easier to prosecute those who transmit HIV or do not disclose
their true status to a sex partner. Current legislation is too costly and
ineffectual.

If Government fails to make these changes and continues with business as
usual, they are abandoning a generation that should be on the spaceship
that the President has just referred to, as being ready for take off.

                          ANC BY-ELECTION VICTORIES

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms C M P RAMOTSAMAI (ANC): The ANC victories in Ward 10 in Grabouw and in
Ward 12 in Stellenbosch yesterday mark a major turning point in the
political landscape in the Western Cape.

The ANC unseated the DA in a ward which was previously dominated by that
party and thereby broke the historic stronghold of the DA rightwing
tendency in Stellenbosch. The ANC victory in this by-election follows the
ANC national conference in December, which was held a few months ago. This
is a demonstration of how much the people of Stellenbosch have taken the
ANC to their hearts and feel comfortable with ANC democratic programmes and
transformation and reconciliation.

The DA on the other hand has suffered a severe backlash from the community
which clearly distances itself from reactionary policies, which
fundamentally divide black and white people and merely serve and advance
alienation and polarisation between the different races in our country.
Viva Stellenbosch! Viva! [Applause.]

                       STELLENBOSCH BY-ELECTION RESULT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Madam Speaker, yesterday's by-election in
Stellenbosch has proved that the New NP and ANC are a formidable force,
supported by two thirds of the voters. This result also shows that people
support the co-operation between the New NP and the ANC. The Western Cape
success story based on co-operative governance speaks for itself, and
people have seen that together we can make South Africa work.
[Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members.

Mr J DURAND: It is however a pity that some voters are still victims of the
DA's `swartgevaar' tactics. It is also ironic that yesterday during the
discussion of the President's Vote the DA chose to accuse President Mbeki
of playing the race card, while the DA's whole campaign is based on
spurring on black fear. The DA uses the Zimbabwean crisis as a smoke screen
to incite racial fears.

In their reckless scramble for votes, the DA shows no understanding of the
racial balances in South Africa. As Alister Sparks remarked when he
referred to the hon Leon:


Leon by contrast is essentially eurocentric, with not an ounce of
empathetic sensitivity to traditional African ways of debate and conflict
resolution.

In the December 2000 local government elections, when the New NP was a
partner of the DA, the DA won both wards. Yesterday's by-election, in which
the DA lost one of its wards, shows that the New NP is reclaiming its
support base while the DA supporters have started to abandon the party.
[Applause.]

                          BOY'S KILLERS STILL FREE

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N C NKABINDE (UDM): Deputy Speaker, the UDM is shocked by reports that
the two former Bophuthatswana policemen who were convicted of the murder of
a 14-year old boy five years ago are still walking about free. It is simply
unacceptable that the family of this boy, who had to deal with the
suffering of burying a young child following indiscriminate violence by
members of the police force, should now suffer again under a criminal
justice system that fails to imprison the convicted murderers.

It is these types of incidents that lead to the perception in many
communities that the criminal justice system favours the criminals instead
of the victims. We condemn the evasion and passing of the buck between the
SAPS, the Directorate of Public Prosecutions and the High Court. An
immediate investigation must be launched and those responsible for this
thoughtless bureaucracy must be severely disciplined. The two convicted
murderers must be arrested immediately and thrown in jail where they
belong.

                             CHILD SUPPORT GRANT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms N M TSHOLE (ANC): Deputy Speaker, the ANC notes with great concern the
press reports that only a fifth of orphans are able to access foster care
grants. The ANC remains committed to the protection of all children in
South Africa and wishes to stress that our Government has put in place
processes to finalise comprehensive children's legislation which will
address these problems.

The new Children's Bill aims to put in place a system of cluster care
whereby children in child-headed households would be able to access grants
under the supervision of, for example, responsible community or faith-based
organisations. The proposed cluster care system would have many benefits in
that it would ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable children would
have access to grants whilst providing the necessary adult supervision and
accountability as well as keeping them together as a family. I thank you.
Your child is my child. [Applause.]

                 REMEMBERING THE FORGOTTEN HEROES OF 16 JUNE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs M A SEECO (UCDP): Madam Deputy Speaker, as we celebrate  June  as  youth
month, we are constantly reminded about the forgotten  heroes  and  heroines
of the 16 June uprising. There is no doubt that they  acted  as  a  catalyst
for change in this country. Less is heard about these individuals  or  young
people, who participated directly in the liberation of our country.

This discriminatory approach has raised serious concerns about the
selective manner in which the democratic Government has sought to honour
those who are perceived to be closer to the ruling party in terms of
ideology as opposed to those who hold different political viewpoints. A
case in point is the manner in which youth leaders such as Tsietsi
Mashinini, Kgotso Siatlholo and others are being ignored and not are not
being honoured. We believe that the Government is morally and politically
obliged to honour these individuals in the manner in which the likes of
Hector Peterson are remembered and given prominence.

            JOB OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY PHYSICALLY DISABLED MAN

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE (Azapo): Madam Deputy Speaker, it is encouraging to
note that a physically impaired former factory worker from North West has
created 11 permanent jobs for local residents. Mr Obed Sikgoa aged 43, a
father of two, is confined to a wheelchair after being shot three times on
the night of 2 June 1994. Reportedly the gunmen were never found.

When I came out of hospital he started a small business venture producing
protective clothing. His clients include Gauteng Public Works, Johannesburg
City Parks, the national Department of Agriculture, Brits Town Council,
Ikageng Clinic Services and the North West Technikon.

Azapo wishes to congratulate Mr Obed Sikgoa and his clients, as well as the
Job Creation Trust administered by the Development Bank for advancing a
loan of R250 000 to Mr Sikgoa. [Applause.]

                            FREE BASIC EDUCATION

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S K MNUMZANA (ANC): Madam Deputy Speaker, in the recent past, the review
of the financing and cost of education, underwent intense scrutiny through
wide public participation. On 11 June 2003, Cabinet accepted an action plan
emanating therefrom. These measures are aimed at ensuring that children
from poor households have access to education. At the heart of such
initiatives, is the ANC's vision of realising our stated objectives of free
basic education for all, as expressed in the Freedom Charter.

[We, as members of the ANC, accept the plea made by Mr Kader Asmal, the
Minister of Education, in connection with the support he gave to children
from needy families, who are poor, by offering them education that is fully
paid for by Government. This will afford poor children an education that is
as complete as that of children from rich homes.

We thank the Cabinet for beginning with that important education, and we,
as leaders, say to the children that there is no greater inheritance than
education. Thank you. [Applause.]]

                 FAILURE OF PRESIDENT TO CLARIFY JIT REPORT

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms R TALJAARD (DA): Madam Deputy Speaker, yesterday the President was asked
to clarify the details of the Auditor-General's section 46 consultation
with the executive on the Joint Investigating Team Report. His failure to
give any explanation for his actions and to account for them and/or his
omissions as chair of the Cabinet subcommittee that dealt with the arms
deal, or alternatively to address any of the questions raised, is a supreme
failure of executive accountability to this House and shows a sheer and
complete arrogance of power in this administration. All the President had
to say was that he did not ask the Auditor-General to alter the JIT Report.
He did not do so. All he had to do was to account to this House if he did
not suggest any alterations. He did not do so. His silence and failure to
clear up the matter, are a cause for profound regret and a disgrace to this
House. [Interjections.][Applause.]

                         ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMIC CRISIS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B W DLAMINI (IFP): Madam Deputy Speaker, it  is  reported  in  the  media
that the National Constitutional Assembly  and  Transparency  International,
which are Zimbabwean civic groups,  are  planning  to  block  South  African
goods from entering  Zimbabwe  because  of  their  alleged  anger  at  South
Africa's percieved damning silence on the arrest of MDC leadership.

These groupings are said to have assumed that South Africa's silence on
this matter amounts to the South African Government's  support for the
clampdown on the MDC leadership. It is also reported that Concerned
Citizens Abroad, another civic organisation based in South Africa, was now
planning to travel to Musina to forcefully shut down the Zimbabwe/South
Africa border.

Whether the anger and frustration of these civic organisations are
justified or not, trading between these two countries is in the interest of
both countries, even more so of Zimbabweans. The blockage will also be
working against the spirit of Nepad.

The Zimbabwean economy has been affected by the political situation. We
therefore urge all stakeholders and relevant bodies to intensify their
efforts towards finding a solution to the Zimbabwean crisis.
                             CHILDREN IN PRISONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr D V BLOEM (ANC): Madam Speaker, it is with  great  relief  that  the  ANC
welcomes the Grahamstown High Court ruling on the immediate  release  of  25
children who have been in jail for up to four  years.  These  children  were
imprisoned while waiting to serve sentences in nonexistent  reform  schools.
Of major concern, is that the Eastern Cape has only one place of safety  for
children in Port Elizabeth which can  only  accommodate  58  children.  This
then hampers the process of carrying out  court  referrals  of  children  to
places of safety.

It is believed that imprisonment of young  offenders  with  other  prisoners
merely perpetuates the criminal cycle with young offenders being  integrated
into a life of crime. This minimises the possibility of young persons  being
rehabilitated and becoming responsible citizens upon release.

Young offenders  do  not  belong  in  prison.  We  need  to  prioritise  and
strengthen  youth  correctional  facilities  and   diversionary   means   of
sentencing.

                           SANDF TROOPS IN THE DRC

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J SCHIPPERS (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP is concerned about  media
reports that indicate that the South African Military Health Service is  not
providing the SANDF troops in the DRC  with  adequate  medical  support  and
that we are not  adhering  to  UN  guidelines.  It  was  also  alleged  that
soldiers who are HIV-positive, were deployed to the DRC. This  is  a  matter
of concern because if it is proved to be true, it means  that  South  Africa
did not adhere to UN guidelines which state that the  entire  South  African
contingency must undergo testing for HIV/Aids and  other  serious  illnesses
before departure.

The shortage and absence of vital medical equipment  is  also  unacceptable.
We cannot send our troops on peacekeeping missions if  we  cannot  guarantee
that they will receive adequate medical attention.
The New NP demands an investigation into this matter to ensure that it  does
not happen again and that we adhere to UN guidelines in future.

                     ELECTION VICTORY IN THE FREE STATE

ANC with 92% of the votes. Mrs Tshidi Matlakala was the candidate for the

the people of Phahameng and Tokologo. [Applause.]]

                            FREE BASIC EDUCATION

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon
Mnumzana for her statement on behalf of the ANC following the Government-
organised review of the financing, resourcing and cost of education. May I
say that this is the most far-reaching study undertaken in our country. It
is part of the whole drive towards removing poverty, particularly in
education, with the relationship of poverty and education so clear that the
real emancipation of young children depends on them getting quality
education.

Therefore, the issue of the cost of education is not limited to school
fees, but covers a whole range of other matters which we call nonpersonal
expenditure. The active discrimination against children in poor and richer
provinces can no longer be countenanced in a democracy. This report also
looks at the cost of uniforms and the status of transport for young people.

In conclusion, we will do our utmost to ensure that the implementation of
the action plan takes place. Of course this will depend on working very
closely with the provinces in establishing the kind of capacity they have
and to ensure that based on the assessment we make, the poorest schools
should get the benefit of this Government concession. Of course this cannot
be implemented tomorrow. We have to take into account the identification of
needs and working with the provinces to ensure that the moneys are made
available.

Beyond that, we wish to say that this is a rather extraordinary document
which I commend to the House because it provides the basis for getting
quality education for the first time for the vast majority of our children.
Thank you very much.

                 FAILURE OF PRESIDENT TO CLARIFY JIT REPORT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, I would like to respond to the
issues raised by the hon Taljaard. I think she is completely out of order
and disingenuous. The Auditor-General has told SCOPA that he will submit a
report himself. To ask the President to speak on behalf of the Auditor-
General is to blur the lines between a Chapter 9 institution and the
executive. It is wrong in every sense of the word and she should be made to
withdraw those comments. [Applause.]

                             CHILDREN IN PRISONS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker, I briefly wish to say
that the hon Bloem is correct. I have been saying over and over again that
children do not belong in prison. I must also add that seeking diversionary
programmes for children should not only be the responsibilty of the courts,
corrections, police and social development, but it is also incumbent upon
members of this House to look for those places where children can serve
their period of correction or places of safety in their own constituencies
to assist Government. This will help children not to find their way into
prisons.

            JOB OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY PHYSICALLY DISABLED MAN

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I would
like to respond to the statement made by the hon Nefolovhodwe. I would like
to thank him for having brought this success story to the attention of
Parliament. The hon member, when making this statement, should have said
that he congratulates this Government for creating an environment in which
businesses can start and grow. It is also the policy of this Government of
preferential procurement that has seen that entrepreneur having clients
such as the Gauteng government and the national Department of Agriculture
amongst others.

Finally, the Department of Trade and Industry's strategy of supporting
small and medium enterprises is very evident in the statement that the hon
member made and I wish to thank him for that.

                         ZIMBABWEAN ECONOMIC CRISIS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: Madam Deputy Speaker, I just want to say a
word or two about a statement that was made by a member of the IFP. There
are two issues here. Firstly, the goods that leave South Africa for
Zimbabwe are destined for utilisation by ordinary Zimbabweans. Those people
who want to stop those goods from reaching Zimbabwe show that they have no
concern and do not care about ordinary Zimbabweans. How can these people
stop food and other goods from reaching Zimbabwe when the ordinary people
need them desperately?

Secondly, I want to say that it is totally irresponsible  for  a  member  of
Parliament to come here and  encourage  people  to  break  the  law.  It  is
totally unacceptable.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member are you rising on a point of order?

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Yes Madam Speaker, I am.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! What is your point of order?

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: I think the hon Minister misheard what  the  hon  Dlamini
said. He did not encourage these people to break the law. In  fact  he  said
the opposite.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, when you  have  another  opportunity,
that issue can be clarified. That is really not a  point  of  order.  Please
proceed, hon Minister.

The MINISTER: So if the hon member was discouraging them, then good. We are
not going to allow people to come here and break the law. It is
unacceptable and this Government will not allow it.

Thirdly, I want to say that the DA is an endangered species. They should be
allowed to proceed with speed towards extinction. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Yes, hon Lekota.

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: I thought you had recognised me, Madam Deputy
Speaker.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Unfortunately hon member, I have recognised five
Ministers already, and that is what I am allowed to recognise. In fact, I
didn't even recognise you. I don't know how your hand did not show itself
clearly, but you will have a chance next time.

                       SPECIAL PENSIONS AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon members, I would
like to begin by reminding hon members that this House adopted a very
special and important piece of legislation in November 1996 - the Special
Pensions Act. The primary objective of the legislation is to provide for
the payment of special pensions to persons, or their eligible dependants,
who made sacrifices or served the public interest in the cause of
establishing a nonracial, democratic and constitutional order in the
Republic of South Africa. These are the people who, as a result of their
devotion to the struggle for a free and democratic South Africa, were
prevented from providing for their own pensions. The implementation of this
Act has had and continues to have a significant impact on the lives of many
deserving people in our country.

Members would again recall that in 1998 the House adopted  an  amendment  to
this legislation to improve the delivery of benefits under this  Act.  Today
we table a second round  of  amendments  to  this  legislation  which  deals
exclusively with administrative matters in order to facilitate and  expedite
the ongoing implementation of the Act. Even as we do so we  may  be  tabling
further amendments as we remain seized with examining on  an  ongoing  basis
the experience we have had in implementing this dispensation in relation  to
the policy parameters that we have set.

The main objectives of the amendment Bill that is before the House today
are: Firstly, to allow the Special Pensions Board to condone late
applications which were received after the closing date contemplated in the
Act. This will open an opportunity for all persons who meet the
qualification criteria as prescribed by the Act, but were left out because
of the cutoff date for submitting applications.

Secondly, to clarify the Special Pensions Review Board's discretion to
condone late requests for the review of decisions of the board. This is
necessary since the current wording is misleading and caused a
misinterpretation of the Act by the review board. The result of such
misinterpretation is that the review board took a decision to condone late
applications to the board for benefits which were subsequently approved by
the board and benefits were granted. The Bill therefore also intends to
validate such condonation of late applications by the review board and the
subsequent decisions taken by the board on such condoned applications.

Thirdly, to prescribe the quorum for any meeting of the board. The Act
currently requires that the board be established with five members but it
does not provide guidelines as to what constitutes a quorum for the purpose
of regularising meetings of the board.

Fourthly, to remove the limitation of the board's existence to four years
after the commencement date of the Act, and to validate the continued
operation of the board. This is necessary since the board has not yet
completed its activities. The board will cease to exist as soon as it has
completed its activities.

Fifthly, to remove the requirement that one member of the review board must
be an actuary as this will save the costs of paying an actuary to sit on
every appeal because the review process does not require actuarial
expertise. The normal three year cycle actuarial valuation of the entire
special pensions scheme, like other pension schemes, will still be
performed, and this is separate from the review process. Furthermore, the
review board may seek actuarial advice on an ad hoc basis if necessary.

Sixthly, to amend the definition of ``military service'' so as to include
military service or training performed or undergone in the former
nonstatutory forces, that is the military forces of the former banned
political organisations as contemplated in the Special Pensions Act. The
current definition excludes persons who performed military service or
undertook military training in the former nonstatutory forces but are not
entitled to special pension benefits.

Lastly, the Bill seeks to effect technical corrections and to provide for
the retrospective effect of certain amendments so as to ensure the smooth
running of administration, the effective and efficient processing of
applications for benefits.

Madam Deputy Speaker, I now table the Special Pensions  Amendment  Bill  for
consideration and adoption by the House. [Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Speaker, as the Deputy Minister so rightly reminded us,
this was a very important Bill that went through our Parliament in 1996.
Many people have told me that were it not for this special pension, they
would not be able to survive. Many people have also told me that they have
still been waiting to hear whether they would receive the special pension.
And we are aware that there has been a deadlock in the special pensions
department. We are also aware of the new board that came in about two years
ago and has been working overtime on many occasions to reduce that backlog
and it is worth noting now that that backlog has now been substantially
reduced.

However, we are aware that there are many potential beneficiaries who are
not yet on the special pensions' payroll and for that reason the special
pensions department has set up a dedicated research unit whose task it now
is to identify those people who ought to qualify. I am thinking in
particular of the families of people who died in detention. I think of
those who were imprisoned. I know that the Robben Island Museum at the
moment is working on a detailed register through their registers of
everyone who came through their doors so as to produce as comprehensive a
list of ex-political prisoners as possible. And I would like to
congratulate them and hope that this too feeds into reaching all those
people whom it should reach.

The political parties still need to come to the table in a much more
concerted way. We still do not have the full details of those people who
were in the camps and who were in exile. And I think we need the
verification process assisted by dedicated personnel within those political
parties. But let me say that this Bill is not the final amendment Bill.

Many people have telephoned me and I have their correspondence and I will
keep that correspondence until that review of the Special Pensions Act is
finally completed. Because we need to fine-tune that Act. We need to look
at areas that need special attention and this Bill before us here is just
simply a Bill to facilitate the working of the Special Pensions Board in
certain matters, pending a more comprehensive review. So, for those who
have been waiting patiently, please bear in mind that this is not the final
Bill. That Bill will be before us later this year. With that I would like
to say the ANC supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Brig Gen P J SCHALKWYK: Madam Speaker, hon Deputy Minister, hon members,
the DA supports the assistance by the Government to provide for old
soldiers or in this case old combatants, after military hostilities had
ceased. This is very commendable and we are very pleased that this is
happening.

The Bill before the House is basically condoning applications for benefits
to the Special Pensions Board after the closing date contained in the
Special Pensions Act of 1996. While we are creating this condition and
creating a more comprehensive approach to the pension dispensation of the
nonstatutory force members, there remains a group of ex-soldiers that were
not catered for through either special pensions or the new dispensation
under discussion. Hopefully this will be addressed as the hon Hogan has
just mentioned.

The Military Veterans' Affairs Act of 1998 provides for the development of
national standards regarding military veterans and their dependants. And
for the President it is very important to be the Patron-in-Chief of all
military veterans. In this Act a military veteran in essence means any
person who served in the Union Defence Force, the South African Defence
Force, the SA National Defence Force and any nonstatutory force as defined
in the Demobilisation Act.

In summary the Special Pensions Act says that MK and APLA veterans will now
be receiving pensions. Those who do not qualify for pensions and who are
not mentioned are those Black, Indian and Coloured military veterans who
worked on a contract basis for the South African Defence Force and who also
did not have the means of contributing to a pension fund. Nor do the white
males who did national service.

I speak with authority on this subject. I have spoken to these neglected
veterans all over South Africa and am now having meetings with them with
the advisory board. This year we will be hosting the 25th General Assembly
of the World Veterans Federation and we must resolve this problem before
that meeting.

My last remark is that the President as the Patron-in-Chief may delegate
his responsibility to the Minister, but he cannot delegate his
accountability. He must remember that and someone must convey that message
to him.

Dr G G WOODS: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The IFP supported the 1996 Act when
it came into being, I think, for the humanitarian considerations which it
represents and we see the amendments before us today simply as being fine-
tuning and in line with those particular humanitarian considerations.

I think one is grateful to the Deputy Minister for reminding us of the
background to this Bill and also to the hon Hogan for giving us some of the
more day to day specifics of the target clients of this Bill and what they
are going through. So, we would like to continue to support this Bill and
the amendments and I think we are somewhat reassured by the fact that there
are unlikely to be any cost implications in respect of this Bill.
[Applause.]

Mnr C B HERANDIEN: Mevrou die Speaker, die Nuwe NP ondersteun die wysiging
soos vervat in die voorgestelde wetgewing hier.

Daar is egter een voorbehoud wat ons nie ongesiens kan laat verbygaan nie.
Ek reken dat die agb Minister hier 'n gulde geleentheid verbylaat gaan het
om te kyk na daardie groep mense wat in die verlede werklikwaar afgeskeep
was. Agb lede sal met my saamstem dat dit nie hulle skuld was dat
ooreenkomste by Kempton Park aangegaan is wat hulle spesifiek uitgesluit
het nie - en vir die Minister se inligting, ek verwys spesifiek na die Suid-
Afrikaanse Kaapse Korps. Dit is ... [Tussenwerpsels.]  Ek weet, maar die
punt wat ek probeer maak, agb Minister, is dat, soos ander lede ook reeds
gesê het, wanneer daar na nuwe wysigings gekyk word ons moet toesien dat
ons ook na hierdie groepe omsien.

Ons mense kom al ver. Elke keer na 'n oorlog het hulle nog net 'n
dikwielfiets, 'n army jas en 'n halfkroon gekry. Die tyd het aangebreek dat
ons na hierdie mense omsien. Ons steun die wysiging, maar ek wil in
dieselfde asem die agb Minister vra dat hy vir ons 'n aanduiding gee dat hy
oop is vir gesprekke in die toekoms sodat ons ook na hierdie mense kan
omsien. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C B HERANDIEN: Madam Speaker, the New NP supports the amendment as
contained here in the proposed legislation.

There is, however, one reservation that we cannot allow to go unnoticed. I
believe that the hon the Minister let a golden opportunity pass to take
care of a group of people that was really neglected in the past. Hon
members will agree with me that it was not their fault that agreements were
entered into in Kempton Park which specifically excluded them - and for the
Minister's information, I am referring specifically to the South African
Cape Corps. It is ... [Interjections.] I know, but the point I'm trying to
make, hon Minister, is that when, as other members have already said, new
amendments are being considered, we should see to it that we also take care
of these groups.

Our people have come a long way. After every war, all they have been given
is a bicycle with thick tyres, an army coat and half-a-crown. The time has
come for us to take care of these people. We support the amendment, but at
the same time I want to ask the hon the Minister to give us an indication
that he is open to discussions in the future so that we can also take care
of these people.]

Mnr A BLAAS: Speaker, die oogmerke van die Wysigingswetsontwerp op Spesiale
Pensioene is reeds bespreek. Die noodsaaklikheid van hierdie wysiging vir
die Weermag word weer eens net 'n slag onderstreep.

Die personeeluitgawes in die Weermag is buitengewoon groot inaggenome die
reeds onvoldoende begroting. Die wysigings sal dit moontlik maak om met die
beoogde menslike hulpbronstrategie van die SA Weermag voort te gaan en die
rasionaliseringsproses af te handel. Die gevolg is dat meer geld vir die
bedryf van die Weermag beskikbaar kan kom en sodoende kan broodnodige
aktiwiteite wat noodsaaklik is om die paraatheid van die SA Weermag op te
skerp, aandag kry. Dit is, soos afgelei kan word uit die begrotingsdebat
van die Weermag, uiters en dringend noodsaaklik.

Die sentimente uitgespreek deur die agb Van Schalkwyk is ook ons kommer en
ons vertrou dat hierdie aangeleentheid binnekort die nodige aandag gaan
kry. Die ACDP sal hierdie wysigingswetsontwerp steun. (Translation of
Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr A BLAAS: Speaker, the objectives of the Special Pensions Amendment Bill
have already been discussed. The necessity of this amendment for the
Defence Force is merely being underlined once again.

The personnel expenditure in the Defence Force is exceptionally high,
bearing in mind the already inadequate budget. The amendments will make it
possible to proceed with the envisaged human resources strategy of the SA
National Defence Force and to finalise the rationalisation process. The
result is that more money can become available for the functioning of the
Defence Force, and consequently absolutely vital activities essential to
the upgrading of the preparedness of the SA Defence Force can receive
attention. This is, as can be deduced from the budget debate of the Defence
Force, extremely and urgently necessary.

The sentiments expressed by the hon Van Schalkwyk also reflect our
concerns, and we trust that this matter will soon receive the necessary
attention. The ACDP will support this amending Bill.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The MF has great respect for the
SA Defence Force. The duties that these men and women have taken upon
themselves and the sacrifices they have made in honour of their country,
are admirable. We extend our gratitude to them.

The MF notes that many forces have joined the SANDF since 1994 and
considers it promising that the unified defence of all South Africans has
been attained. As regards the amending Bill, the MF is supportive of
accommodating pensions in that manner. Our nation owes it to these
dedicated members of the SANDF. Their wellbeing in their old age is our
responsibility and it is an injustice to deprive persons of a pension they
are entitled to.

The amending Bill appears to be in order and appropriate for deserving
people, and the MF supports it. [Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Speaker, die belangrikste wysiging in hierdie Wetsontwerp
is die uitbreiding van die definisie van militêre diens, ingevolge Klousule
8. Die NA het begrip daarvoor dat vanweë historiese omstandighede daar
talle werknemers is, veral in die SA Weermag, wat op 'n relatief hoë
ouderdom in diens gestel is en nou om den brode in diens moet bly vanweë 'n
gebrek aan pensioen. Daarom vertrou ons dat die wetswysiging daartoe sal
lei dat die ouderdomsprofiel in die Weermag sal kan verbeter. Dit spreek
vanself dat 'n man wat met 'n kierie loop  nie 'n goeie voetsoldaat kan
uitmaak nie. Ons hoop dat hierdie wetgewing 'n beter bedeling vir hulle
daar sal stel om dan met pensioen te kan gaan.

Ek het 'n vraag. Moes daar nie 'n afsluitdatum gekom het by klousule 1 nie?
Soos dit tans staan, bly dit oop vir enige laat aansoeke tot op watter
stadium ook al. Die NA steun ook die pleidooie van die agb Schalkwyk vir 'n
beter bedeling vir veterane en ons steun met graagte hierdie stukkie
wetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Speaker, the most important amendment in this Bill is the
extension of the definition of military service, in accordance with clause
8. The NA can understand that, owing to historical circumstances, there are
many employees, especially in the SA Defence Force, who were employed at a
relatively advanced age and who now have to continue working in order to
earn a living, owing to a lack of pension. We therefore trust that the
statutory amendment will lead to an improvement in the age profile in the
Defence Force. It goes without saying that a man who walks with a cane
cannot make a good infantryman. We hope that this legislation will bring
about a better dispensation for them, so that they will be able to go on
pension.

I have a question. Should there not have been a closing date in clause 1?
As it stands at present, it remains open for any late applications up to
whatever stage. The NA also support the appeals of the hon Schalkwyk for a
better dispensation for veterans and we take pleasure in supporting this
piece of legislation.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Madam Speaker. I think it's
important to state first of all that from the start of the process of
establishing this dispensation, we have sought to ensure that all political
parties are agreed on what this dispensation is meant to achieve. And I
think in order for us to retain that essential consensus around the special
pensions dispensation, it's important for us to maintain the position of
what this special pension dispensation was created to address. Because once
we begin to address a whole variety of issues that are not related to what
this dispensation was created for, then we lose that essential consensus
that we had from the beginning. Just to recap: It's important to say that
we created this dispensation in order to recognise the fact that there's an
important category of South Africans who worked towards the achievement of
the dispensation that we are enjoying today.

We say today that we have a democracy in South Africa. We have a
constitutional dispensation in South Africa. There are people that worked
for this and as a result of that were not able to provide for their own
pensions. We are essentially therefore recognising the fact that those
people did not manage to provide for a pension for themselves.

The important thing about this, is to make the point that we are not paying
people because they were involved in the struggle. We're recognising the
fact that people lost an opportunity, either through being banned, or
imprisoned or exiled, to provide for a pension for themselves.

These are important points to remember, because if we begin to raise the
issue of military veterans who worked in the previous dispensation to
uphold the previous dispensation, this Act cannot address that particular
issue, because this Act was promulgated to deal with people who fought for
the establishment of the present dispensation. This is therefore not the
right place to raise the issue of those categories of people who served in
the defence force at that stage.

Madam Speaker, I wish to thank parties very much for the support they have
generally given to this legislation.
Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

               FINANCIAL AND FISCAL COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Financial
and Fiscal Commission is a constitutionally independent body established in
terms of section 221 of the Constitution, and is regulated by the Financial
and Fiscal Commission Act of 1997. It plays an important advisory role to
Parliament and other legislatures. It also advises Parliament and
Government on whether the annual division of revenue between the three
spheres of government is equitable. The FFC also makes recommendations on
most legislation affecting the fiscal powers of provincial and local
spheres of government.

The Bill is largely a technical and consequential Bill, motivated by the
legislative obligations arising from the enactment in 2001 of the
amendments to section 221 of the Constitution, which reduce the number of
commissioners from 22 to nine. The new reduced commission will consist of a
chairperson, a deputy chairperson, three members nominated by the
provinces, two persons nominated by organised local government and two
other persons. The constitutional amendment reduces both provincially and
nationally nominated members.

The President will continue to appoint the chairperson, the deputy
chairperson and the two nationally nominated members. However, whereas
before each province nominated one person to the President to appoint to
the commission, so that the nine provinces nominated nine persons, this
Bill addresses how the nine provinces, through their Premiers, are to
nominate three persons for appointment to the commission. Each province can
no longer assume that the President will appoint its nominee to the
commission.

The new section 221 (i)(a) of the Constitution requires national
legislation for Premiers and organised local government to compile a list
of nominees. Local government will continue to nominate two persons to the
commission. The Minister has to compile a list of all these nominees and
circulate it to the nine Premiers, who will endeavour to reach consensus on
a shortlist of four nominees, one name more than the number of vacancies
that are to be filled.

If the Premiers reach consensus on the four names, the President will
appoint the commission from this list. If the Premiers cannot reach
consensus, the complete list of nominees will be submitted to the
President, and he will make the appointments by choosing three of the
nominees whose names were submitted for appointment to the commission.

The nomination of the two persons by organised local government will take
place in accordance with the process as set out in the Organised Local
Government Act of 1997. The Bill also provides for the President to consult
with the Premiers and organised local government before removing any of the
members nominated by them.

Two further amendments are also made to the Act. One of the amendment
extends the functions of the FFC to provide advice when functions are
shifted between spheres of government. Stipulations in section 3 aim to
prevent unfunded mandates resulting from the shifting of functions between
spheres of government.

Before powers or functions can be assigned to the provincial or local
spheres of government, the transferring organ of state must seek the advice
of the commission on the financial implications. Such an assignment of a
function will have no legal force until a written indication is given that
the FFC's advice was sought and considered. There is also a need to consult
with the National Treasury, as the shifting of functions will have
implications for the division of revenue between the three spheres of
government.
The last set of changes to the FFC Act brings it into line with the
provisions of the PFMA. Although the PFMA already applies to the FFC, and
overrides the provisions on financial management, the amendment merely
removes those provisions from the Act that duplicate or are in conflict
with the PFMA, particularly those provisions relating to financial
statements.

I hereby present the FFC Amendment Bill for consideration and adoption by
the House. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Madam Speaker, hon members, the Bill before us today in the
main addresses four issues, as has been explained by the Deputy Minister,
to bring the Financial and Fiscal Commission Act into line with the
Constitution as amended by Act 61 of 2001, which reduces the number of
commission members from 22 to nine, and also to bring the Act into line
with the PFMA.

It also proposes the insertion of a provision which would require any organ
of state which intends assigning any power or function to an organ of state
in another sphere of government to request the advice of the FFC, on any
financial implications of the said assignment.
Lastly, it amends section 5 of the Organised Local Government Act of 1997
in order to provide for a process whereby local government can participate
meaningfully in the compilation of a list from which the President will
make two appointments in terms of section 5 of the FFC Act, in accordance
with the Constitution as amended in 2001.

These amendments have been necessitated by a number of occurrences. Key
among these is the transformation of the state machinery as per the ANC's
resolutions at our last conference in December last year. The liberation of
our people will be meaningless if the state machinery is not geared towards
the delivery that would push back the frontiers of poverty.

The FFC is an important role-player in the budget process and has undergone
tremendous transformation itself since its establishment. This commission
was established in accordance with section 221 of the Constitution as an
independent body whose main responsibility it is to make recommendations
that inform the intergovernmental policy-making process. The commission is
also part of an elaborate set of mechanisms for establishing policy and
balancing the myriad interests of a democratic and progressive state.
Given this unique position and the role assigned to it in the Constitution,
the commission is at the centre of the debate on the equitable sharing of
nationally raised revenue and, therefore, continues to make recommendations
in an independent and impartial manner.

The commission has played its role quite effectively in the past nine years
and its independence has never been called into question. When making its
recommendations it has been guided by a few principles, as stated in its
annual report. The constitutional status of each sphere of government is
respected and the Constitution's Bill of Rights, which mandates the
provision of basic services to all citizens, as well as the key principle
of good intergovernmental relations and strong consultative arrangements
with key stakeholders in the fiscal system.

The ANC-led Government established these structures in order to deepen
democracy and promote transparency and accountability. That is why these
amendments are intended, among other things, to bring the FFC Act into line
with the PFMA, and to enforce this extensive consultation with the
commission with regard to assigning functions and powers among organs of
state within spheres of government.
This amendment goes further and states that if this consultation did not
occur, as the Deputy Minister indicated, then the assignment would have no
legal force. The reason for this is that such assignments inevitably have
financial and fiscal implications which may at times result in unfunded
mandates for provincial and local governments.

This amendment also deals with section 5 of the Organised Local Government
Act of 1997 by giving organised local government the opportunity to
participate meaningfully, as I have indicated, in the appointment of the
two members.

The ANC's commitment to democracy is rooted in the Freedom Charter which
states clearly that, ``The People Shall Govern'' and hence this process.
Participatory democracy is key to the transformation of the state machinery
and building a developmental state that delivers basic service to all,
particularly the poor.

These amendments are, therefore, nothing but a vehicle through which the
ANC Government ensures that the national democratic revolution is closely
guarded and that it succeeds. The FFC is but one of those structures that
ensures the delivery of quality service to our people which is sustainable
and cost-effective. In our oversight visit to the commission I was
encouraged to see the dedicated staff and to hear them speaking so
passionately about their role in ensuring that the commission's
constitutional mandate is achieved.

In the commission's Medium-Term Expenditure Framework for 2004-2007 the
commission makes very clear proposals with regard to expenditure
assignments, performance measurement provision on the constitutionally
mandated basic services, poverty targeting and norms and standards. The
commission also makes very valuable recommendations with respect to the
health, education and social development provincial equitable share
formula, as well as the overall provincial equitable share formula.

I trust that all relevant committees are going to engage with these
recommendations. I am aware that these recommendations have already been
presented to the budget council and we look forward to further engagements
that will see these issues taken forward. The ANC supports these
amendments. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Madame Speaker, colleagues, in a debate on the Constitution
of the Republic of South Africa Second Amendment Bill in November 2001, my
colleague, Dr Delport, stated the following when the number of FFC
Commissioners was reduced from 22 to 9:


  We have a concern, however. In the present composition, specific
  provision is made for nine persons per province to take care of the
  interests of the province. This falls away. This is being reduced to
  three members who will be appointed by the President from a pool.


  We want to appeal to the hon President to appoint a well-balanced
  commission that will take proper care of the interests that the
  commission will be entrusted with. We have every confidence that he will
  do so.

The Bill before the House brings the FFC Act in line with the Constitution,
as amended by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Second
Amendment Act of 2001. The newly introduced provisions create a favourable
dispensation to involve the provinces in the President's appointment
procedure of the reduced number of FFC Commissioners. The involvement of
the nine Premiers in compiling a short list of nominees for the President
to appoint from must be welcomed.

The amendment to section 3 of the FFC Act will strengthen the FFC's hand
considerably in guarding against any organ of state in one sphere of
government, seeking to assign any power or function to any other organ of
state in another sphere of government, in accordance with any law, without
consulting the FFC and soliciting its views in terms of new mandatory
provisions. This could be a powerful tool in the hands of the FFC in
warding off any unfunded mandates. And this will be a crucial new extended
power for the FFC.

As we formalise the implications of the constitutional amendment today, the
focus must, however, fall on the reform of the intergovernmental fiscal
system on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the FFC. Not only will the
formulas for revenue allocation to the provinces and local government be
reviewed, based on the Census 2002 data once it is finally released by
Statistics South Africa, but crucial questions will need to be asked about
the role of the FFC in assisting legislatures as part of its oversight
duties, whether this be Parliament or the respective nine provincial
legislatures.
Parliament needs to subject the executive and all these departments that
have to appear before portfolio committees, to questions based on the FFC
recommendations. The Portfolio Committee on Finance currently plays the
leading role in processing the Division of Revenue Bill to which the FFC's
recommendations speak.

However, Parliament will have to sharpen its oversight focus and the
portfolio committees will have to play a very important and prominent role
in this regard to ensure that oversight is exercised over the FFC
recommendations and whether or not they are taken up by the respective
government departments. This will have to be a sharpened focus of oversight
and accountability, tracing the FFC recommendations through all the
respective portfolios, with portfolio committees interacting with one
another and with the Portfolio Committee on Finance when the division of
revenue is processed through Parliament. The DA supports this Bill.

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Speaker, the IFP continues to question the relevance of
the FFC and to support the idea that at some stage we bring the issue up
for broader debate.

I think we all know the intention of the Constitution in giving birth to
the FFC, but I think, looking back and asking whether it has fulfilled that
intention, does raise some questions. And, partly, this is an expression of
the confidence of the IFP in the Treasury, for one, that I think in
covering the particular responsibilities of the FFC Treasury, has displayed
that it has the in-house capacity and expertise. But I think it is also
confidence in the structures, the processes, the Minmecs and the role of
the NCOP, etc, in ensuring that the degree of communication that takes
place between the various spheres of government indeed does take place. I
think the admission from Treasury over a number of years is that the extent
to which they are influenced by the FFC's thinking is limited.

Coming to the amendments before us, and I think in particular the amendment
of immediate substance which is the issue of unfunded mandates, our
question would be: Is this something of a futile amendment? Section 35 of
the PMFA has already asked that all legislation - and this amendment refers
specifically to legislation - in future be accompanied by full costings of
any effects of transfer of powers or functions. There again our reasoning
would be that that would filter through the systems and the structures, and
to give this as a further assignment to the FFC does puzzle us somewhat. We
have to be somewhat cynical in asking whether these are not just issues and
assignments which attempt to give the FFC a greater appearance of purpose
and relevance. Nonetheless, we do think that there is no harm done, even
though it is a costly exercise supporting the FFC, and we will support the
Bill.

Dr W A ODENDAAL: Agb Speaker, na my mening is een van die belangrikste
wysigings wat in hierdie wetsontwerp vervat is dat 'n staatsinstelling wat
'n regeringsbevoegdheid of regeringsfunksie van een vlak van regering na 'n
staatsinstelling in 'n ander regeringsvlak wil verskuif, eers die kommissie
moet raadpleeg oor die finansiële implikasies van so 'n skuif voordat dit
sal kan gebeur. Dit sal na my mening goeie finansiële bestuur binne die
staatsdiens bevorder.

Die ander wysigings wat voorgestel is, is hoofsaaklik administratief van
aard om die wetgewing in ooreenstemming te bring met die bepalings van die
Grondwet en daarom is dit 'n voorreg vir die Nuwe NP om hierdie wetgewing
te steun. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL: Hon Speaker, in my opinion one of the most important
amendments contained in this Bill is that an organ of state which seeks to
assign any power or function of one sphere of government to an organ of
state in another sphere of government, should first consult the commission
on the financial implications of such assignment before it can take place.
This will, in my opinion, promote sound financial management within the
public service.

The other proposed amendments are mainly of an administrative nature to
bring this legislation into line with the provisions of the Constitution,
and that is why it is a privilege for the New NP to support this
legislation.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Madam Speaker. The MF is pleased with the
amendments made to this Bill to bring it in line with our national
Constitution, and has no objection to the added provision of having to seek
the advice of the FFC on any financial implications when an organ of state
assigns a function to another organ of state. In fact, the MF considers
this beneficial in preventing provincial and local governments being
assigned unfunded mandates.

The amendments to bring the Bill into line with the Public Finance
Management Act of 1999 and the proposed amendment to the Organised Local
Government Act of 1997 are supported. The transitional arrangements that
the Bill proposes in respect of the members of the commission appears
adequate. The MF supports the Financial and Fiscal Commission Amendment
Bill.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Speaker, hierdie wetswysiging is hoofsaaklik tegnies van
aard om die samestelling van hierdie kommissie in lyn te bring met die
grondwet. Die vermindering van die personeel van die kommissie van 22 na 9,
soos reeds in die grondwetwysiging goedgekeur, maak sin, asook die meer
vaartbelynde prosedure waarvoor daar in hierdie wetswysiging voorsiening
gemaak word.

Die FFK se werk is van groot belang in die hele begrotingsproses. Die
toewysing en verdeling van die fondse na verskillende sfere van die
regering is van kardinale belang in 'n land soos Suid-Afrika. En dit is van
groot belang dat hierdie kommissie moet bestaan uit kundiges, dat dit
effektief moet kan funksioneer en dat dit nie 'n tou-trek forum tussen
verteenwoordigers van nege provinsies moet wees nie. Daarom is die
betrokkenheid en die samestelling van die kommissie, eerder as direkte
deelname deur die provinsies, te verwelkom.

Die NA spreek die vertroue uit dat hierdie wetswysiging daartoe sal lei dat
die FFK sy kardinale rol effektief sal kan vervul en ons ondersteun graag
hierdie stukkie wetgewing. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Speaker, this Statutory amendment is mainly of a
technical nature to bring the composition of this commission into line with
the Constitution.

The decrease in the number of members of the commission from 22 to nine, as
already approved in the amendment to the Constitution, makes sense, as does
the more streamlined procedure for which provision is made in this
statutory amendment.

The FFC's work is of great importance in the whole budgetary process. The
allocation of the funds and their division among different spheres of
government is of vital importance in a country like South Africa. And it is
of great importance that this commission should consist of experts, that it
should function effectively and that it should not be a tug-of-war forum of
representatives from the nine provinces. For that reason the involvement
and composition of the commission, rather than direct participation by the
provinces, is welcomed.

The NA expresses the hope that this statutory amendment  will  lead  to  the
FFC being able to fulfil its primary role effectively and we  take  pleasure
in supporting this piece of legislation.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I would like to thank all
members and all parties for the support that they have given to this
amending Bill. Indeed, these are largely technical amendments that do not
change the policy foundations of the FFC, and the issues that the hon Gavin
Woods raised are possibly matters that we might want to debate when we are
dealing with the foundations of the FFC.

I want to believe that the considerations that applied when the FFC was
established still remain valid today. The reason for this is that in an
environment like ours with the system of government that we have - in which
we are also trying to address a whole host of issues, such as the
disparities that exist between different provinces and the whole legacy of
apartheid that we come from, it becomes important to pay special attention
to the issue of how the resources of the nation are allocated. I still
think that it is important to have a voice such as the FFC that
dispassionately applies its mind to the issue of the division of revenue
between the different spheres of government, but also carries out other
important functions such as we are introducing now.

One of the problems that we have had to deal with in the past has been
unfunded mandates, where functions were just transferred to other spheres
of government without the concomitant consideration of what the financial
implications are. So, perhaps on another day this is a matter that we can
debate, but we still believe that the FFC is a relevant organisation.

I want to possibly agree with the hon Taljaard on the issue of whether we
have been able to pay particular attention to the work that the FFC tables
before Parliament, and that there may be a need to sharpen the focus. I
believe this also applies to other areas pertaining to some of the
documents that we table in this House: The Estimates of National
Expenditure and the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review. I think in general I
would agree that there should possibly be a somewhat sharper focus on those
documents, but I would like to thank all members for their participation in
this debate.

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                  MINING TITLES REGISTRATION AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Thank you, Chairperson. Today
is another important day for minerals and energy and yet another milestone
in the transformation of the mining and minerals industry. This milestone
is in the form of yet another piece of legislation, the Mining Titles
Registration Amendment Bill, which is designed to further entrench and
deepen the transformation effort introduced by the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Act.

As hon members will recall, one of the most important administrative
activities envisaged in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act
is the conversion of old order rights into new order rights. It is
therefore critical that the new process of migration from the old mining
regulatory dispensation to the new one should take place in a similar and
orderly process. The Mining Titles Registration Amendment Bill is therefore
a necessary supporting leg to bring about and give effect to this
transformation.

The process and the objectives of this amendment are therefore the
following: To amend the Mining Titles Registration Act of 1967 with regard
to certain definitions; to regulate the reregistration of mineral and
petroleum titles and other rights connected therewith and certain other
deeds and documents; to effect certain amendments necessary to ensure
consistency with the MPRDA; to repeal obsolete provision and to provide for
matters connected therewith.

This Act accordingly establishes a central point for the registration and
recording of all mineral and petroleum titles in South Africa granted in
terms of the MPRDA and creates a central mineral and petroleum deeds and
information service in the country thereby bringing the one-stop shop
principle to fruition.

The Mining Titles Registration Act, Act 16 of 1967, as it stands is not
compatible with the transformation initiatives ushered in by the MPRDA.
This Act regulates the registration of mining titles and other rights
connected with prospecting and mining. Stand titles and certain other deeds
and documents that provide for matters incidental thereto are therefore not
included in the Mining Titles Registration Act for the implementation of
the new mining regime.

It is as a result of this gap that there is a need to amend this technical
but important piece of legislation to make sure that the gains made in the
transformation initiatives are consolidated. There is a need therefore to
amend this legislation in order to align it to the new policy position and
legislation requirements.

Other changes in the legislation are the granting of the power to make
regulations to the Minister and the abolition of the mining lease board
that was established to make, alter and rescind the said regulations
previously. The rights granted in terms of the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Act are defined as real rights which when registered
in terms of this Act in the newly established Mineral and Petroleum Titles
Registration Office become binding on third parties. This Bill further
provides for the simultaneous registration and deregistration of rights in
the Department of Minerals and Energy and the Department of Agriculture and
Land Affairs and guarantees the continued registration and existence of
rights.

The Mining Titles Registration Amendment Bill gives effect in a practical
way to the notion of mineral resources being a national patrimony and
therefore the asset of all South Africans as spelt out in the Mineral and
Petroleum Resources Development Act. In terms of the proposed section 16 of
this Bill, prospecting and mining rights will not form part of the joint
estate and succession to rights will be subject to sections 9 and 12 of the
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Act 28 of 2002. This
principle meaningfully recognises that mineral resources in this country
belong to all and not just a chosen and privileged few. Access to
information which has been an obstacle to entry by the previously
disadvantaged will now be guaranteed in terms of this Act.

All these aspects of the law are new and important features of the new
regime, including this proposed legislation. One of the implications of not
amending the Mining Titles Registration Act would be that access to
information would remain limited, and this would have dire and direct
consequences for the meaningful participation of previously disadvantaged
people in this essentially limited equitable access to the mining and
mineral industry.

Security of tenure will be compromised, since this provision dealing with
mining and prospecting had been repealed in the Deeds Registries Act, and
is not provided for in the Mining Titles Registration Act, Act 16 of 1967.
Rights will be deregistered if provision is made in the form of amendments,
and this would have negative implications on ownership of prospecting,
mining and other related rights.

In the light of the efforts of the Department of Minerals and Energy to
redress the inequalities of the past within the mining industry, our
approach to the implementation of the new mining regime will be holistic
and it is for this reason that this Act should commence on the same date as
the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act. This Act should
commence on this date to ensure that the current dispensation is in place
and we are able to meet the target and the needs of our people in terms of
ensuring that the transformation which is happening in the mining industry
does take place with immediate effect. [Applause.]

Mr M T GONIWE: Chairperson, on 26 June last year this august House passed
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill of 2002. This piece of
legislation sets the direction for the overall transformation of the
mineral and petroleum industries. Our Constitution requires that Government
consults with the public in the development of policy and legislation and
that Parliament plays an oversight role in the activities of the executive.

When this Bill was presented to the portfolio committee for consideration,
the committee felt that the department had not consulted sufficiently with
stakeholders. The committee, therefore, requested the department to go back
and consult more with stakeholders. This kind of intervention led to an
improved Bill and one which did not cause a lot of ructions within the
industry. This is an indication of the important role Parliament plays in
making sure that the executive gives effect to its constitutional
obligations.

Public hearings were conducted in a manner which gave all parties an
opportunity to express their views on the Bill and present alternatives to
the proposals presented by the executive. The hearings were open to all who
wished to participate. It is, therefore, the view of the committee that we
have sufficiently consulted with the public. In so doing, we have complied
with our constitutional obligations and rules of Parliament relating to
consultation. Therefore, the Bill presented to this House today broadly
represents the views of all stakeholders in the mineral and petroleum
industries.

The Mining Titles Registration Act of 1967 gave effect to the registration
requirements of the Mining Rights Act of 1967, and other related mining
legislation of our sad past. As hon members may recall, it was the policy
of the apartheid and colonial governments to exclude blacks from
participation in the minerals industry. Since the registration Act dealt
with rights granted in terms of discriminatory legislation, it is obvious
that discriminatory practices were also reinforced in and by the
registration Act.

The promulgation of the Minerals Act of 1992 led to the duplication of
registration of prospecting and mining rights in two government
departments. This state of affairs became untenable and could not be
allowed to continue within a legislative framework which commits Government
to effective and efficient administration and to the principles of Batho
Pele and service delivery.

In a nutshell, the Mining Titles Registration Act of 1967 is completely out
of sync with the legislative and policy realities of the new South Africa.
It is therefore crucial that the Act should be brought into line with the
governing and legislative principles of the new South Africa. In so doing,
Parliament is giving effect to the constitutional provision that states
that all laws that were in force when the new Constitution took effect,
continue to be in force until subjected to an amendment or repeal by the
National Assembly.

The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act guarantees security of
tenure of prospecting and mining rights, and efficient and effective
administration of rights and the registration thereof. Most importantly,
the Act enshrines the transformatory agenda of the Government.

In line with the requirements of the law, the department, in consultation
with stakeholders, developed the broad-based socioeconomic empowerment
charter and the scorecard. These two documents give effect to the
empowerment policy of Government. These instruments have redefined black
economic empowerment by extending the areas which the original definition
was confined to. The new definition addresses issues such as equity,
participation in management, human resources development and employment
equity, community development, procurement, migrant labour, housing, living
conditions and beneficiation.

The amendment of the 1967 Act will ensure that Government is given the
capacity and ability to ensure that all the requirements of the charter,
the scorecard and other provisions of the law are being met and where
noncompliance is identified, appropriate actions are taken in terms of the
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr B G BELL: Chairperson, hon Minister, hon members, it is an honour to
speak on behalf of the DA in this discussion of the Mining Titles
Registration Amendment Bill. This Bill will bring the Mining Titles
Registration Act of 1967 into line with changes needed to meet the
requirements of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Act 28
of 2002.

The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act cannot be implemented
as the money Bill is still awaited. The money Bill has not had a very
promising start with the industry as it appears to be flawed and needs to
be changed considerably before the industry will accept it.

The Mining Titles Registration Amendment Bill has been through a thorough
consultative process with stakeholders, and public hearings were held. The
industry raised many problems and this necessitated a large number of
amendments. This brings us to a problem. It was agreed to fast-track this
Bill with a view to discussing it on 20 June - tomorrow. Then on 18 June -
yesterday - it was announced that to meet programming difficulties, the
Bill had to be discussed today. This means that the administration staff
had to make all these amendments and print the Bill in time for us to have
a copy of the amended Bill this morning.

I must congratulate the staff for achieving the impossible. The only
problem is that none of us has had time to check that the amendments are
those that were approved and voted on yesterday. Therefore, I, therefore,
cannot guarantee that the Bill we are discussing is the same one that we
approved in the committee.

This is a Bill of a technical nature, but there are areas where the
affected communities can be disadvantaged. One aspect I wish to highlight
is the clause that gives the Director-General the authority to destroy
documents. This is obviously necessary in some cases as there is a limit to
the number of documents that can be stored. My request is that in the
regulations governing this action, a first choice for disposing of these
documents would be to return them to the last registered owner, who could
then decide what to do with it them. They could be kept as a family
heirloom or if the owner is a company, they could be kept in the company
archives. In 1989 I was involved in researching the history of 100 years of
coal mining in the Witbank area and documents like that would have been
extremely useful.

Another area of grave concern is the position with regard to succession. A
mining right or other rights granted under the Act may be given to an
individual. Should this individual pass on, the right lapses, and by law
any mining or other activity taking place, should cease. This could affect
the small mine community - the one man shows - in particular, as section 56
of the Mines Act mentions that the right lapses only if there are no
successors. In fact, it was stated that the spirit was to have the right
revert to the state.

This is a nightmare and will require a great deal of discussion and
thought. It may require amendments to a number of clauses. The discussion
that took place in the the committee yesterday, when I raised the issue,
proved that there is concern in this regard.

In conclusion, the DA will support the Bill, but it would like to voice its
disapproval of the fast-tracking of the Bill, which lays us open to
criticism that were passed, a Bill which I personally cannot vouch for.
Thank you for listening.

Mr E J LUCAS: Chairperson, Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy,
colleagues, last year when Parliament passed the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Act, it was immediately clear that the mining
landscape in South Africa would forever be dramatically altered. The
cornerstone of the Act was that mining and other related rights would in
future belong exclusively to the state, which would have the power to
decide who gets authorisation to mine or to prospect through a system of
permits and licences. Existing rights would have to be converted to so-
called new order rights in the course of a transitional period of five
years.

The adoption of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act also
meant that a large number of consequential amendments would have to be made
to existing statutes. The Bill being debated today provides for a number of
these consequential amendments. In essence it amends the principle Act of
1967 to provide for registration of mineral and petroleum titles under the
new legal dispensation. It also proposes a number of amendments to ensure
it is in line with the MPRDA.

Finally, it amends the Deeds Registry Act of 1937 to remove outdated
functions in regard to the registration of mineral rights from that Act. In
doing so, the Bill creates the Mineral and Petroleum Titles Registration
Office to deal with all mining titles and other rights that have to be
registered in terms of the MPRDA. The Office will be created within the
national Department of Minerals and Energy.

The Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Energy held public hearings on the
Bill on 28 May, where the Chamber of Mines and De Beers made submissions.
The main issues of concern centred around the possibility of immediate
deregistration of old order rights and an inability to register
transactions during the transitional period, the status and manner of
registration; destruction of old records and the effects of the Bill on
matters of succession and partnerships.

These very important stakeholders raised the possibility that immediate
deregistration would have extremely adverse consequences for our mining
industry and for empowerment initiatives and would therefore be contrary to
the objectives of the MPRDA and the mining empowerment charter. The
department countered that immediate deregistration was not the intention
and that a difference in interpretation was really the main problem.

In the end, the committee had to take a balanced view of the objectives of
the Bill and the real or imagined potential to seriously damage our
economy. This balance, the IFP believes, was successfully achieved and we
can therefore support the Bill. We also support the fact that numerous
clauses dealing with the power of the Minister to make regulations, the
continuation of existing registers during the transitional period; the
ability to destroy or preserve old records, the issue of succession in
title and public access to the Mineral and Petroleum Titles Registration
Office were tightened up at the committee stage.

I would like to raise one additional issue. The creation of the Mineral and
Petroleum Titles Registration Office to deal with registration issues under
the new legal dispensation will no doubt place an additional burden on the
Department of Minerals and Energy and its officials. Although the
department is functioning well overall, it suffers from capacity
constraints in most sections. I can only hope that the new office will be
adequately resourced to ensure a smooth and unencumbered registration
process in this vital economic field. [Applause.]

HON MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Ms L M T XINGWANA: Mhlalingaphambili, iNdlu ngokubanzi, andifuni kuzihlupha
... [Chairperson and the House in general, I would not like to bother
myself ...]

... about a party that belongs to the era of the dinosaurs ...

... eze kulibazisa inkululeko yabantu. Ngenene siwubhexeshile lo mthetho
phaya kwiKomiti yeZimbiwa, singxamele ukuba mawupasiswe ngale mini
yanamhlanje kuba ngaphandle kwalo Mthetho uyilwayo, lo mthetho siwupasise
ngosuku loXwebhu lweNkululeko kulo nyaka uphelileyo, awukwazi ukufezekiswa.
Ngoko ke oko kuthetha ukuba amalungelo abantu afayilishiwe asekhabhathini.
Siyawakhupha ke ngoku. Abo ke bafuna ukulibazisa abantu bangawafumani
amalungelo abo, baza kuba neengxaki ezingapheliyo.  (Translation of Xhosa
paragraph follows.)

... whose intention it is to delay the progress of our freedom. We
discussed this amending bill in the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and
Energy and we thought that it would be passed today because without the
backing of this amending bill, the Act that we passed last year on Freedom
Charter Day cannot be implemented. That would mean that people's rights
would just be on paper. We are giving people their rights by doing this.
Those that are delaying the process with the intention of denying people
their rights are going to encounter a lot of problems.]

Those are just delaying tactics.

Enye into ke, umntu omdala akavanga kakuhle ukuba ezi ngxakana anazo azikho
azichatshazelwa kulo Mthetho uYilwayo sithetha ngawo, kodwa zikulowa
wapasiswa kulo nyaka uphelileyo. Makajonge kuwo, uya kuncedakala phaya.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Another important thing is that the old man may not have heard properly
that his issue is not included in this Mining Titles Registration Amendment
Bill, but is included in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development
Act that was passed last year. He should consult it, that way he will be
sorted out. ]

This amendment brings to life the Mineral and Petroleum Resources
Development Act that was passed last year. The passing of the Mining Titles
Registration Amendment Bill will enact the spirit and objective of the
Freedom Charter. This Bill will give mineral rights to the people who were
previously denied these rights and excluded from the mining industry for
centuries. The Mining Titles Registration Act, which was passed in 1967,
was used by the apartheid regime of yesteryear to exclude the majority of
our people from this important industry.

Mhlalingaphambili, njengoko senditshilo uMqulu weNkululeko utsho ukuba
ubutyebi bezimbiwa zeli lizwe phantsi komhlaba mabubuyele ebantwini. Lo
Mthetho uYilwayo wenza oko ke namhlanje njengokuba siyipasisa nje.
(Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[Chairperson, as I have already said, the Freedom Charter states that the
wealth generated from minerals of this country should be given back to the
people. This Amending Bill's objective is exactly that.]

This amendment gives mineral rights to the downtrodden, the oppressed and
the exploited. Through this amendment opportunities will be opened up to
all, including the vulnerable groups that never counted before, such as
rural communities, women, people with disabilities and the youth. Through
this Bill black women and people with disabilities will, for the first time
in the history of South Africa, own mineral rights in their motherland.
This is a watershed Bill, hon members. This law will enact mineral rights
that are bondable.

Oku kuthetha ukuba uthatha iphepha lakho olinikiweyo uye nalo ebhankini uye
kuzifunela imali yokuvula umgodi wakho, ungumama wasezilalini; ungutata
wasezilalini. [Uwelewele.] [Kweaqhwatywa.] Oku kubonisa ukuba wonke ubani
uza kulingana afumane nethuba lukuxhamla ubutyebi beli lizwe, malungelo
lawo awanikwa ngulo Rhulumente ka-ANC. Oku kuza kunika amalungelo kubo
bonke abantu, omhlophe, ontsundu, ongumama nongutata ngokulinganayo.
Siwanikiwe ke ngoku la malungelo yaye kucacile ukuba uRhulumente ka-ANC
ulwela amalungelo abantu. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[This means that as a man or woman from a rural area one can take one's
title to the bank when applying for financial assistance to open one's own
mine. [Interjections.] [Applause.] This indicates that everybody will be
equal and receive equal opportunities and also benefit from the wealth of
this country, and only the ANC-led Government has made that possible. This
will give rights to all the people; white, black, female and male equally.
These rights have been awarded to us and it is clear that the ANC-led
Government is fighting for people's rights.]

The tide has turned.

Iitafile zijikile ngoku zibheke phezulu. Ongumsebenzi uza kufumana
amalungelo akhe ezimbiwa nobungxowankulu. Umsebenzi uza kuxhamla naye kulaa
ngxowa inkulu. Sibulela kakhulu kwiSebe  lethu leZimbiwa naMandla ngokuba
lisinike iMining Charter. Le Mining Charter ke ifuna ukuba ... (Translation
of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[The tide has now turned. Workers are going to receive their mining rights.
They are also going to enjoy the benefits of being in the business. We
would like to commend the Department of Minerals and Energy for providing
us with the Mining Charter. The Mining Charter therefore, wants ...]

 ... black economic empowerment to be broad-based.

Ifuna ukuba ezezimbiwa zibe noxanduva lokuphuhlisa abantu. Ngoko ke
ivumelana kwanalaa Mthetho wethu ubizwa ngokuba yiMinerals and Petroleum
Resources Development Act esiwupasise kulo nyaka uphelileyo. Ufuna ukuba
ukuze ufumane iphepha-mvume lokuba nomgodi kufuneka ube nesicwangciso esiza
kubonakalisa indlela oza kubaphuhlisa ngayo abantu. (Translation of Xhosa
paragraph follows.)

[The Mining Charter's primary  objective  is  for  the  mining  industry  to
develop and empower people. In that way it is in agreement with the  Mineral
and Petroleum Resources  Development  Act  that  we  passed  last  year.  It
requires one to have a business proposal that is  going  to  incorporate  an
aspect of the empowerment and development of people.]

We do not want other ghost towns like Welkom ...

... abalambileyo namhlanje kuba bengasenanto. [... that today has nothing
to show.]

They are empty shells today.

Bahambile bagoduka baya eRhawutini bayishiya iWelkom ilambile. Asifuni
ukuba kushiyeke imingxuma emikhulu efana nalowo useKhimbali. Sithi
makubekho ... (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[They have gone back to their homes and have left Welkom poor. We do not
want big holes left open like the one in Kimberley. We are saying that
there should be ...]

... an environmental impact study.

Sithi makubekho iiprojekthi eziqalwayo ekuhlaleni njengezolimo ukuze zithi
xa ziphela ezi zimbiwa, nanjengokuba ziphela emva kwexesha lithile, abantu
babe benemisebenzi okanye ezinye iinkqubo eziza kubaphilisa kwezo ndawo
zabo. Ezi nkqubo ke lithi iSebe mazisetyenzwe kunye nabantu.
Mababandakanywe abantu basekuhlaleni, beendawo ezisemaphandleni ngakumbi
oomama. Kunyanzelekile ukuba bathathe inxaxheba. Kananjalo iihostele
maziphele phaya emigodini. (Translation of Xhosa paragraph follows.)

[We propose that farming projects should be initiated in communities so
that when there are no longer any mines - as the resources become depleted
at a certain point in time - people will have jobs or other programmes that
will generate revenue in their communities. Communities, particularly rural
ones and especially women, should be fully incorporated. It is imperative
that they participate fully. We are also proposing the conversion of
hostels into family units.]

They must be converted into family units ...

... ukuze abasebenzi bakwazi ukuba bangazithenga. Sithi ke ezi zimbiwa,
iplatinamu, idayimani, igolide, mazisetyenzwe kweli. Mazingahambi ziye
kuthengiswa eAmerica naseYurophu tshiphu zingakhange zenziwe apha. Sifuna
ukuzenzela ngokwethu la macici ngeedizayini zethu esiza ukuzithenga tshiphu
apha ekhaya. Ngaloo ndlela senza imisebenzi ukuze oomama nabantwana bethu
bafumane.

Sithi iimoto, intsimbi ilapha eMzantsi Afrika, nazo mazenziwe apha, sakhe
imisebenzi ngaloo ndlela. Kwakhona sithi makukhutshwe iitenda zokulungisa
ukutya, ezokucoca nezokuthutha abantu, kuyekwe ukunikwa iinkampani ezinkulu
zoongxowa eRhawutini. Makunikwe abantu apha eMafikeng, apha eRustenburg,
ePholokwane. Siyazi ukuba zinkulu eziya tenda, ziziqingatha zeebhiliyoni
zeerandi. Inxalenye enkulu yayo mayiye ebantwini ekuhlaleni.

Kukho iithagethi ezimiselwe lisebe ezinjengoo-10% emiselwe oomama. Kambe ke
sithi kule minyaka mihlanu yokuqala - lukhulu olu shishino - oomama banga
bangalifumana, ngaloo ndlela singaloyisa iphango. Sithi ke malunabe olu
shishino iye ebahlalini nabo banikwe amathuba eetenda babe
neendibaniselwano (joint ventures) ingabi ngu- one man show lowa ufunwa
ngutata wakwa-DA. Thina sifuna ibroad-based black economic empowerment.
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of Xhosa paragraphs follows.)

[... so that workers are able to buy them. We would like beneficiation of
platinum, diamonds and gold to be done here. Our minerals need not be
exported to America and Europe at a very low cost. We want to produce gold
and diamond earrings ourselves so that we could buy them cheaply. In that
way we would be creating job opportunities so that our mothers, women and
children could benefit.

We have iron in South Africa and, therefore, cars could be manufactured
here, which would create jobs. We are also asking that tender notices
should be issued for catering, cleaning and transport services and that
they should not be awarded only to big businesses in Johannesburg. People
from Mafikeng, Rustenburg, and Pholokwane should provide these services. We
know that they involve a lot of money, billions of rands. Part of that
money should go to the people.

There are targets that the department has set, for instance, the 10% that
is set aside for women. We therefore say that in the first five years women
should get an opportunity and in that way we would win against poverty and
hunger. This is big business. The business should be extended to
communities so that they can establish join ventures so that we do not have
the one-man shows that the hon member from the DA desires. We want broad-
based economic empowerment. [Applause.]]

Through this Bill, the restructuring of the economy has begun. The war
against want that will push back the frontiers of poverty has begun. Indeed
the tide against poverty is turning and for this reason the ANC supports
this Bill. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Chair, thank you very much. I will have to be quick here.
The Bill before us today is quite intentionally progressive,
transformative, BEE-friendly, in a hurry, urgent and necessary. During the
public hearings people made me laugh when they spoke about old order rights
and new order rights. I thought that we had old order privileges and not
rights. When I heard the Minister talk about real rights I thought that we
had real wrongs, and only now are we giving real rights through this
transformation process to people who have actually been wronged.

I would like to share with the House what some of the people had to say,
especially the mining houses. Some of them even accused the Minister of
trying to regulate or nationalise the mines by stealth. They pointed to
ministerial consent and so forth. And I asked myself: Who's talking now?
These people invented ministerial consent the past, but some of us,
including myself, were victims of ministerial consent because in those days
one could not enter Wits without ministerial consent. But, now that we
would like to rectify things using some of the laws that empowered other
people, they suddenly find these new terms new, or is it old.

Yes, of course there is concern about the financial institutions, their
impact and the implications, impediments and so forth. Some of them became
emotional. Some of the legal advisors were issuing warnings all over the
show talking about the title records which might become invalid with the
introduction of new rights which then would pose a problem when disputing
the rights were disputed.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Please take your seat, hon member. Do
you have a point of order, hon member?

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: Can the hon member take a question?

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Only if he says please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Are you taking the question, hon member?

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Only if the member says please.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Proceed, hon member.

Mr A M MPONTSHANE: I just want to know from the member what he was
referring to when he asked whether it was new or old. Is he referring to
the National Party as being old or new?
Mr B M DOUGLAS: That question does not really tickle my fancy and he never
said please. So, I will not answer that. Chairperson, I see that the member
took some of my time, but he is an old colleague so I will forgive him.
Yes, fingers were also pointed at the impact and the implications of the
Deeds Registries Act, the Matrimonial Property Act and some people went as
far as trying to use customary marriages and the impact that that would
have on title deeds etc. They went to town with it. In the end, wise
counsel eventually prevailed and agreement was reached. The New NP supports
the Bill. [Time expired.]

Mr A BLAAS: Chair, as was indicated during the introduction of this Bill,
it is predominantly administrative in nature and to bring it into line with
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act. I want to interrupt
myself. If my memory serves me correctly, last year during the debate on
the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, an undertaking was
given by the hon the Minister that this would be tested constitutionally. I
am not sure whether I am right or wrong. If I am wrong then I will accept
it. I am open to correction.

This Bill does not fully satisfy all the concerns of the stakeholders but
in general they are all fairly comfortable with its contents. This can be
attributed to the wide consultation that took place and the co-operation of
the department to accommodate the concerns of the interested parties.

It must be pointed out that the final version of this Bill was not
available to us prior to this debate. I believe it was released this
morning but by two o'clock this afternoon it had not reached the third
floor of the Marks Building.

The portfolio committee only approved the final amendments in draft form
yesterday, because of the pressure to get the Bill through Parliament. We
are again at a disadvantage in that we have to accept in good faith that
the Bill is as it was approved by the committee. We support the Bill. [Time
expired.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Malibongwe! [Praise!] Chairperson, the MF has no objection
to the amendment effected to the Bill to bring it into line with the
Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Act 28 of 2002. It is felt
that transformation is necessary in all sectors and forms to make us a
successful democracy.

The mining sector has contributed greatly to state income and necessary
transformation would encourage this. The MF, however seeks a balanced
representation of persons, regardless of colour or gender within the
sector.

A concern of the MF is the HIV/Aids pandemic and it is hoped that strong
measures are being taken to control the situation in the mining industry.

Once again the MF finds the amendments adequate and supports the Mining
Titles Registration Amendment Bill.

Mr G G OLIPHANT: Thank you very much, Chairperson. Members, we must be
reminded that next Thursday, 26 June 2003, we will be celebrating the 48th
anniversary of the Freedom Charter. We have additional copies available for
the members on the left, because some of them have asked to know more about
this historic document.

Hon members will also recall that last year on the same date we passed the
legislation that changes the ownership pattern of the mineral wealth of
this country, namely the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act,
Act 28 of 2002. That legislation was subsequently assented to by the State
President on 10 October 2002. So, it is law. We need to start applying the
provisions of that Act.

This Act gives practical expression to the Freedom Charter which says,
amongst other things, that ``the people shall share in the country's
wealth'' and we know that this industry that we are talking about is worth
about R800 billion. We should be able to share in that wealth. Gone are the
days where some people would register the wealth of this country in their
own names, in the names of their spouses, their children - born and unborn
- and then bind us as a country to say when they are dead that we cannot
take over anything that belongs to their children. [Applause].

We are saying that we are changing this pattern around and we are creating
opportunities for members of communities out there to go and ensure that we
participate in the mining industry in many ways. That includes setting up
companies and ensuring that people go to the Department of Minerals and
Energy to say that they want to mine there. That includes issues that the
comrade spoke about concerning procurement. If we take the Northern Cape as
an example, the mining industry there earns close to R4 billion every year
and that money has always gone to the same people. When we do constituency
work, we have to go back and change the situation around.

We, as a committee, agreed to fast-track this Bill. I would urge members of
the opposition to respect this agreement. The Chief Whip of the Majority
Party stood up here the day before yesterday and said that we should
suspend the three-day rule relating to this and the House agreed. Now
members come here and claim that they did not see the final draft of the
Bill, it reached the third floor too late and things like that. We are
talking about a few pages. This short Bill. One minor addition that was
made in the committee was to include a section, section 11. That was the
only change that was made. So, I do not think it is fair to this House to
come here and complain about these issues. It is confusing, and I see that
people are opposing merely for the sake of opposing.

Having said that, it is as a result of the Act that we passed last year
that we are bringing this Mining Titles Registration Amendment Bill to the
House. This Bill seeks to translate that promise into reality by ensuring
that the Act that was passed in 1967, the Act of exclusion no longer
applies. It was an Act of dispossession, an Act that stated that a Black
person - they called us many names and I cannot quote those names now -
could not have these rights. We are now able in our own name and right, to
go and register a title and this title is bondable. We are able to raise
funds to engage in mining. So, the difficulties caused by this Act are
actually eliminated.

After we passed that Act last year the department engaged in a long process
of consultation with stakeholders, including  business. So the people who
are actually involved in the mining industry are not complaining about what
we have here today. On whose behalf is the DA complaining if not on their
own behalf only? Out of that process of consultation a mining charter and a
scorecard - I have copies of them here - were produced. If the DA did not
complain, thank you very much.

These issues address a lot of things, including the seven pillars on human
resource beneficiation. And beneficiation becomes vital because we have
close to 59 different minerals in this country. We have to follow each one
of them and say, what happened to the diamonds, the platinum, the gold and
the manganese. Like Comrade Xingwana said, we are able to create a lot of
jobs out of this process. The issue of employment equity becomes key, as
does the living conditions of mine workers.

Lastly, I want to emphasise that our transformation agenda for the mining
sector and liquid fuels is irreversible. Our victory here is certain and
forever forwards, never backwards. Today once more this Parliament is
called upon to pass this Bill, legislation which anchors the Act that we
passed last year. The previous Act was based on racial discrimination and
dispossession and we must get rid of it because it was passed by the old
regime in 1967.

For the first time we are able to say in the charter itself that within 5
years 15% of the ownership of the mining industry must be transferred into
the hands of Blacks or the historically disadvantaged. We are saying that
within 10 years it must be not less than 26%. We are also appealing to the
companies that are coming out to ensure that those who are on top take the
moral responsibility to ensure that all the people in the communities are
uplifted through this legislation.

In conclusion, to complete the cycle of transformation in the sector we are
awaiting the introduction of the Royalties Bill and the Beneficiation Bill.
We trust that Government will move expeditiously in order to complete this
whole cycle of transformation.

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY: Chairperson, I would like to
take this opportunity to thank members of the committee for supporting this
Bill and making sure that the question of mining becomes a reality in South
Africa. But I would also like to take this opportunity to respond to Mr
Bell and say that the Royalties Bill need not be an obstacle to the
implementation of this particular Bill. This is a small amendment, it might
be technical but it is very critical and important with regard to
transformation and when he talks about representing some of the mining
companies - I do not know which ones - I would accept the opinion of the
member who said that they are representing themselves. He is representing
the DA. That is not the view of the industry.

I think the DA needs to come to terms with the fact that the days when they
thought they represented big business are gone. Big business has left them
out because they are refusing to transform and change, hence, on the basis
of that, they represent their jackets. So, gone are those days. And I also
want to respond to the opinion that this Bill cannot be passed because
there was not sufficient time - I agree with the hon Douglas who says that
while it suited them in the past when we use the same language today it no
longer suits them. They do not understand it anymore. It is amazing!

They are the coiners and the creators of this language. Now it is being
implemented for them and to help them, they do not understand it anymore.
It is their own English, I do not know what happened. I agree entirely that
they need to understand their own terminologies which were meant for them
but, in this case, they are not meant for the few but are meant to benefit
every citizen of South Africa.

And part of that, as we celebrate Freedom Charter Day next week, but also
as we celebrate the success of having passed the Mineral and Petroleum
Resources Development Bill in this Parliament last year, shows a success
and this particular technical amendment is minute and minor. It need not
create problems for the members.

I must thank the IFP's Mr Lucas for the continuous support he has shown to
the department. The powers which have been vested in the Director-General
are not vested in just him, they are exacerbated in consultation with the
Director of Archives. It is very important for the member Mr Bell to
understand that and it is vital to understand what that means. One also has
to understand the law of South Africa. Information cannot be disposed of
without consultation and some of those laws were created by the previous
dispensation and they were good laws which we inherited and kept.

However, I disagree with the suggestion of the hon Bell that the
information should be returned to the owner. That cannot happen! Why should
it go back? That information belongs to the state and must be used for the
benefit of South Africans and not individuals. So, we cannot take the
information because he is saying the current dispensation must remain in
store, because that is exactly what is happening.

All mineral rights and various issues are being kept all over the place.
One of the challenges for our department and which is going to require a
lot from us and will necessitate employing more people is to make sure that
all the mining and mineral rights which are all over the place in private
hands are brought to a central point to make sure that they are accessible
to all South Africans.

So, we cannot go back. We are moving forwards, as the hon Oliphant
indicated, never backwards! We do not have to go back to the past when it
comes to holding information. [Applause.]
Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

    CONSIDERATION OF SEVENTH REPORT OF WORKING GROUP ON THE AFRICAN UNION

There was no debate.

Ms E THABETHE: Thank you, Chair. On behalf of the Chief Whip of the
Majority Party, I move:


That the report be adopted.

Agreed to.

    CONSIDERATION OF REQUEST FOR APPROVAL BY PARLIAMENT OF INTERNATIONAL
  CONVENTION ON PREVENTION AND PUNISHMENT OF CRIMES AGAINST INTERNATIONALLY
               PROTECTED PERSONS, INCLUDING DIPLOMATIC AGENTS

Mr M A MAZIYA: Chairperson, hon members, the Portfolio Committee on Safety
and Security considered and officially agreed on the ratification of the
two conventions. Apologies from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and
Justice and Constitutional Development were accompanied by the endorsement
on the unanimous decision taken in the portfolio committee meeting.
International obligations to become party to these conventions as soon as
possible stem from South Africa's commitment to combat terrorism in UN
Resolution 1373 of 2001, the Nonaligned Movement and the OAU Convention on
Terrorism.

Apart from being obliged as a UN and AU member state, South Africa is also
formulating an Anti-Terrorism Bill which these two conventions form part of
in Chapter 2, section 3 and Schedule 1, section d. The International
Convention on Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally
Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents, is aimed at the prevention
of such terrorist acts as murder, kidnapping or other attacks on the person
or the liberty of internationally protected persons; a violent attack upon
the official premises, private accommodation or means of transport of
internationally protected persons; any other threat or attempt to commit,
any or participation as an accomplice to, such attacks; and the prosecution
and punishment of the perpetrators.

Protected persons include the head of state and government ministers of
foreign affairs when in foreign states. Representatives or officials of the
state or agents of international organisations pursuant to international
law become entitled to special protection - see Vienna Convention. The Bill
has to look at criminalising attempts and accomplicity to commit offences
against internationally protected persons.

This provision should also be applied to the International Convention
against the Taking of Hostages. The International Convention against the
Taking of Hostages aims at criminalising the seizure, detaining and
threatening to kill, injure or continuance of detaining another person in
order to compel the third party, an international intergovernmental
organisation, a natural or judicial person, or group of persons to do or
abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the
release of hostages. Attempts to do this as well as participation as an
accomplice to commit or attempt hostage taking are also criminalised. The
International Convention against the Taking of Hostages does not apply when
the offence is committed within a single state, when the hostage and the
alleged offender are nationals of that state, and when the alleged offender
is found in the territory of that state.

At an interdepartmental meeting comprising of representatives from the
National Intelligence Agency, the South African Secret Service, the SAPS,
the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development, and the
Department of Foreign Affairs on international measures to combat
terrorism, it was decided that the South African Police Service would co-
ordinate comments and proposals from all relevant departments on South
Africa's proposed accession to these conventions.

The implications of ratification are that should these conventions be
acceded to by Parliament, the Republic of South Africa will have regional
as well as international obligations to fulfil concerning terrorist acts.
The legislation concerning terrorist acts is addressed in the Anti-
Terrorism Bill which is in the process of being discussed in the Portfolio
Committee on Safety and Security. I therefore propose that this Parliament
approve these two conventions. I thank you.

There was no debate.

International Convention on Prevention  and  Punishment  of  Crimes  against
Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents, approved.

           INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION AGAINST THE TAKING OF HOSTAGES

            (Consideration of request for approval by Parliament)

There was no debate.
International Convention against the Taking of Hostages approved.

The House adjourned at 16:30.

    EMPLOYMENT OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL DEFENCE FORCE IN COMPLIANCE
     WITH THE INTERNATIONAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
                   TOWARDS THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANISATION


     This serves to inform the National Assembly that I authorised the
     employment of South African National Defence Force (SANDF) personnel in
     order to fulfill the international obligations of the Republic of South
     Africa towards the UN in The Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as
     part of disarmament, demobilization, re-integration, repatriation and
     the resettlement programme of the UN.


     This employment was authorised in accordance with the provisions of
     Section 82(4)(b)(ii) read with Section 227(l)(b) and (c) of the
     Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1993 (Act No 200 of
     1993), [which Sections continue to be in force in terms of Item 24(l)
     of Schedule 6 to the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996
     (Act No 108 of 1996], read further with Section 3(2)(a)(iv) of the
     Defence Act, 1957 (Act No 44 of 1957).


     A total of 1 268 personnel, will be deployed for a period of one  year,
     making a provision for a rotation after every six months, as follows:


     (a)    950 X Infantry Battalion Group

     The National Treasury advised that the shortfall should be addressed
     through the normal budgetary process.


     I will also communicate this report to the Members of the National
     Council of Provinces, and wish to request that you bring the contents
     of this report to the notice of the National Assembly.
