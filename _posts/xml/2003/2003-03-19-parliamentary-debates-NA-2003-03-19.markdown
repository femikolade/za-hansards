                      CROSSING OF THE FLOOR LEGISLATION

                               (Announcement)

The SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, before proceeding with the business of  the
day, I wish to make an announcement on the  coming  into  operation  of  the
crossing of the floor legislation.

Hon members, you are aware that the National Council of Provinces  yesterday
agreed to the Constitution of South Africa Fourth Amendment Bill.  The  Bill
has been sent to the President for his assent. Members should note that  the
legislation comes  into  operation  on  a  date  set  by  the  President  by
proclamation in the Gazette. The window period for members to  change  party
allegiance in terms of the legislation  commences  immediately  on  the  day
following the date of the commencement of the Act.

Members or parties who wish to  use  this  window  period  to  change  their
status should only do so within the window period. We should advise  you  of
when the window period commences. Any member or party wishing  to  make  any
change during this period should complete a  special  form  which  has  been
prepared for this purpose, and will be available from the Chief Whip of  any
party, or from the Secretary to the National Assembly, Mr Hahndiek, or  from
Undersecretary Dr Ismail.

Members and parties should note that for purposes of informing  the  Speaker
of any intended changes, they should personally submit the  completed  form,
which will be the only valid form, to either Mr Hahndiek or Dr  Ismail.  The
form will include  covering  notes  containing  details  which  members  and
parties will need to comply with in order for the change to be valid.

Members, this is to alert  you  to  the  proper  procedure  that  should  be
followed, and at which point you will be able to change any status.

We will now proceed with  the  business  of  the  day.  The  first  item  is
questions addressed to the Minister of Transport, that  were  standing  over
from last week. In terms of  the  Rules,  30  minutes  have  been  added  to
question time, to allow for these questions. At the expiry  of  30  minutes,
we will proceed to questions addressed to members in the Peace and  Security
cluster. So we will now take Question No 15 standing  over  from  Wednesday,
12 March, which has been asked by the hon N  Magubane  to  the  Minister  of
Transport. I call on the Acting Minister.

QUESTIONS AND REPLIES - See that book.

                            MOTION OF CONDOLENCE

                          (The late Ms Linda Mbeki)
The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Deputy  Chairperson,  I  move  without
notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes with sadness the passing away of Ms Linda Mbeki,  elder  sister
       to President Thabo Mbeki, who after a short illness, lost her life on
       Thursday, 13 March 2003, at the age of 61;


  (2) extends its profound sympathy to  the  Mbeki  family,  relatives  and
       friends; and


  (3) expresses its sincere condolences:


       Sithi, akwehlanga lungehli nina  baKwaMbeki,  May'ilale  kahl'intombi
       yakwethu. [We say, sincere condolences to the Mbeki family. May  your
       sister rest in peace].

Agreed to.

                POLICY ON BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT STRATEGY

                                 (Statement)
The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chairperson, may I thank  you  for  this
opportunity to address the House. I think it is appropriate  that  I  inform
the House of the progress made by Government in setting out  the  policy  on
black economic empowerment. Today  Cabinet  adopted  the  broad-based  Black
Economic Empowerment Strategy, as was announced by President  Mbeki  in  his
opening address in this House on Friday, 14 February. All comments  made  by
Cabinet are now being incorporated into the final documentation, and I  will
release this on Monday, 24 March, in Pretoria.

The draft Bill will be finalised at the next Cabinet meeting, and will  then
follow the normal course of legislation. However, let me  make  some  points
in anticipation of that more detailed announcement. The essence of  the  new
strategy  can  briefly  be  stated  as  follows:   The   strategy   outlines
Government's policy objectives, as  well  as  the  policy  instruments  that
Government will consistently and predictably  use.  The  policy  instruments
include the formalisation of partnerships, or charters, as  they  have  come
to be called, with the private sector, where this is  appropriate;  the  use
of  a  balanced  scorecard  approach  to  gauge  success  on  the  part   of
enterprises and sectors; and an Act that allows  for  the  formalisation  of
guidelines, codes and the establishment of an advisory council.

In addition, new financial support measures  are  introduced,  and  existing
financial support is better aligned with the  strategy.  In  general,  there
will now be considerable information available  to  all  as  to  the  policy
intention and approach of the Government.  The  essential  elements  of  the
strategy are briefly outlined in what I say now: The strategy proposes  that
black economic empowerment or BEE should be broad-based and  inclusive,  and
should result in both higher  levels  of  black  ownership,  as  well  as  a
reduction in income  inequalities.  It  should  result  in  effective  black
participation in the economy, and this participation should be reflected  in
both the broadening of the entrepreneurial base and increased  participation
in managerial, professional and other skilled occupations.

Clear mechanisms are spelt out to ensure that BEE is  broad-based  and  that
local communities and employees benefit from the  empowerment  process.  The
BEE  process  will,  therefore,   include   elements   of   human   resource
development,  employment  equity,   enterprise   development,   preferential
procurement, as well as investment, ownership  and  control  of  enterprises
and economic assets.

These factors are those that are embodied in, and have  been  developed  in,
the Mining Charter. Black economic empowerment  goes  beyond  political  and
social obligations. The creation of a more equitable economy is  fundamental
to the acceleration of South Africa's  economic  growth.  Empirical  studies
indicate  that  more  egalitarian  societies  tend  to  experience   greater
economic growth. The deracialisation of the economy is  therefore  essential
for political and social stability,  but  is  also  essential  for  economic
growth.

The strategy has at its call  the  promotion  of  partnerships  between  the
public  and  private  sectors.  The  partnerships  would   assist   in   the
formulation  of  empowerment  policies  and  programmes,  as  well  as   the
development   of   workable   empowerment,   financing   and   institutional
arrangements. Sector and enterprise -based charters are  one  of  the  forms
that such partnerships  can  take.  Such  charters  would  need  to  include
specific  mechanisms  to  achieve  BEE  objectives  in   that   sector,   or
enterprise, in a comprehensive, but appropriate manner, as well  as  provide
measurement indicators and targets where they can be set.

With regard to targets, it is proposed that these be set at the  appropriate
level so as to ensure accountability. Charters with relevant  targets  would
be encouraged in those sectors where Government issues licences,  and  where
Government  exercises  strong  regulatory   control.   In   other   sectors,
especially the broader manufacturing and service sectors, Government  should
encourage companies to develop company, or enterprise, charters.

The strategy is the  culmination  of  a  process  that  began  in  2001.  An
interdepartmental  task  team,  which  was  established  in  2001   in   the
employment and investment cluster,  co-ordinated  input  to  assist  in  the
development of a BEE strategy. Clearly this strategy has also been  informed
by the BEE commission report, an integrated  national  BEE  strategy,  which
was submitted to Government in April 2001.

Presentations have been  made  to  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Trade  and
Industry. The BEE strategy was discussed at the Cabinet  makgotlas  in  July
2002 and January 2003, and finally the strategy document has  been  informed
by discussions and written input from a  number  of  external  stakeholders:
the Black Business Council,  the  Black  Business  Working  Group,  the  Big
Business Working Group and the Trade and Industry Chamber  of  the  National
Economic Development and Labour Council.

I would like to particularly thank a number of business  leaders  for  their
well-considered  and  supportive  comments  which  have  been  sent  to   my
department as we finalised the documentation. Between now  and  the  passing
of the legislation, and the formal  setting  up  of  the  advisory  council,
there is of course a further chance to refine the document, and  to  promote
this seminal strategy.

I shall convene a task team to provide the  kind  of  invaluable  assistance
many have provided over the last few months. Once again,  I  thank  you  for
this opportunity. I am sure we all look forward to the work  in  this  House
that we will now have to do as we  enter  a  new  phase  of  South  Africa's
successful and purposeful economic transformation. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M J ELLIS: Mr Chairman, we have an  arrangement  with  the  Chief  Whips'
Forum that when a Minister makes a statement to the House,  that  copies  of
that statement will be given to parties. I am not aware that this  statement
has yet been given to parties. I  take  this  opportunity  to  ask  the  hon
Minister if he would make it available to us.

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Chair, it will be my  pleasure  as  part
of the empowerment of all parties. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  As  agreed,  parties  will  be  afforded  an
opportunity to respond to the statement at a later stage.

                           WATER WEEK CELEBRATIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J F VAN WYK (ANC): Hon Chairperson, South Africa is celebrating  National
Water Week from 17 to 23 March 2003. The theme of  this  year's  celebration
is: ``Water is our future''. It is focused on promoting the  protection  of,
and respect for, South Africa's scarce water resources.

Apart from the various provincial activities, a number of  events  are  also
associated with this year's National Water Week. The celebrations will  also
serve as the lauch of the United  Nations'  ``International  Year  of  Fresh
Water'' in our country. The third World Water Forum also  takes  place  from
16-23 March, and our delegation, under the leadership  of  the  Minister  of
Water Affairs and Forestry,  the  hon  Ronnie  Kasrils,  is  attending  this
important event.

Two national water award events will also be hosted  during  National  Water
Week. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry in association  with  the
Water Research Commission and the  Water  Institute  of  South  Africa  will
present the Woman Water Award for the second time after its launch in  2002.
The aim of the award is to recognise the role of professional and community-
based women in the management of water in South Africa. The youth and  water
awards will also be launched this  year  to  recognise  the  role  of  South
African youth in promoting water, sanitation and hygiene.

Although the ANC has  made  significant  progress  in  addressing  the  huge
backlog in potable  water  supply,  and  has  accelerated  its  delivery  of
sanitation over the past few years, there are still about 6  million  people
who are without safe and clean water, and about 18  million  people  without
proper sanitation. The protection  and  wise  use  of  our  country's  water
resources are necessary to prevent its pollution, and to make provision  for
the growing demand for it.

We, therefore, call on all South Africans, especially the youth ...

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr J F VAN WYK: Thank you very much, Chairperson. [Applause.]

                            ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S V KALYAN (DA): Chairperson, the claim  by  the  Minister  of  Finance,
Trevor Manuel, that ``Aids drugs are a lot of voodoo'' is  further  evidence
of the  Government's  grossly  irresponsible  approach  to  Aids.  Phumelani
Luthuli was  wheelchair-bound  and  almost  semiparalysed  before  he  began
antiretroviral treatment at the Ithemba LaBantu Clinic in Umlazi.  Today  he
is mobile and active as a result of drugs funded by  the  Aids  Health  Care
Foundation.  His  example  adds  to  the  enormous  body  of  evidence  that
antiretroviral drugs restore health to people with Aids in  a  way  that  no
other intervention, including nutrition, can.

The DA demands that the Government faces up to  the  calamity  of  Aids  and
make available to all South Africans the treatment that allows Phumelani  to
live a full and productive life. It is the right thing to do.

                      RELIEF OPERATION IN POST-WAR IRAQ

                            (Member's Statement)

Ms S A SEATON (IFP): Chairperson, it now appears  that  a  war  in  Iraq  is
imminent and unavoidable. Regrettable as this may  be,  I  believe  that  we
should, at this point, focus our attention on  a  post-war  Iraq.  It  seems
certain that war in Iraq will lead to  a  large  humanitarian  crises.  Many
innocent civilians will probably lose their lives.  The  country's  critical
infrastructure will  be  severely  damaged,  including  possibly  hospitals,
water treatment facilities and so on.

Million of Iraqis will require assistance of some  sort  or  another.  Food,
medicines, clothing, shelter and clean water would definitely be needed.  We
believe that as soon as the situation  in  Iraq  is  stabilised,  a  massive
international humanitarian effort should be launched to help  those  injured
or displaced by the war. Planning for that  relief  operation  should  start
now. The IFP, therefore, calls on the South African Government to  join  the
international community under the banner of the United  Nations,  and  other
relief agencies,  in  immediately  launching  a  comprehensive  humanitarian
effort to assist Iraqis affected by the imminent war.

                KENYA'S ACHIEVEMENT IN THE CRICKET WORLD CUP

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr A MLANGENI (ANC): Comrade Chair, Kenya faces India in  the  semifinal  of
the Cricket World Cup. It is to be noted that this  young  Kenyan  team  has
produced memorable performances during the  Cricket  World  Cup  competition
thus far. We recognise that Kenya holds the only hope  of  Africa's  success
in this competition. The achievement of  Kenya  in  this  competition  is  a
matter of pride for Africa.

We congratulate Kenya on reaching the semifinal stage of  this  competition,
and wish them the best of success in their semifinal encounter  with  India.
We call on our youth  throughout  the  continent  to  emulate  these  Kenyan
athletes by registering  significant  victories  in  international  sporting
events. We also express the hope  that  the  success  story  of  Kenya  will
engender in our youth an interest and a will  to  succeed  in  the  game  of
cricket and sport in general.

We further believe that these  momentous  achievements  are  a  contribution
towards a firmer Africa as a shining example to the rest of the world.  This
sporting achievement by the Kenyan cricketers is a  meaningful  contribution
in the quest for an African Renaissance. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

             VIEW OF MINISTER OF FINANCE ON ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUGS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S  M  CAMERER  (DA):  Chairperson,  the  Minister  of  Finance,  who  is
generally quite sensible about things,  seems  to  have  lost  his  grip  on
reality when it comes to the provision of  antiretroviral  drugs  to  fellow
South Africans who are HIV-positive or have Aids.

Yesterday he started jabbering that the drugs were ``voodoo  medicine''  and
described their effectiveness as ``bunkum''. It was almost  as  if  the  hon
Manto had cast a spell on  him.  Another  sensible,  even  brilliant,  South
African, Judge  Edwin  Cameron  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeal,  has  a
different view. At his public interview as a candidate  for  appointment  at
the Judicial Services Commission a couple of years ago, he told us  that  he
was gay,  HIV-positive  and  that  he  had  been  kept  alive,  healthy  and
productive because of a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs that he took  every
day.

Judge Cameron did one  of  the  most  outstanding  interviews  that  I  have
witnessed, and he is a brilliant judge who is making a lasting  contribution
to our law and our society. Without these ``voodoo medicines'' he  would  be
dead.

There are a lot of potential Judge Camerons out there, mostly young  people,
who will die prematurely if they cannot access these  drugs.  Judge  Cameron
gets a high salary and can afford to pay for  the  drugs  himself.  Most  of
them are poor and rely on the state to provide them.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time has expired.

Mrs S M CAMERER: I am amazed that the hon Minister is turning  his  back  on
his fellow South Africans in this way. [Time expired.]

        ABUSE OF BLACK ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT TO OBTAIN MINING LICENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr T ABRAHAMS  (ANC):  Hon  Chair,  one  appreciates  the  urgent  need  for
opportunities to be extended to historically disadvantaged  South  Africans,
particularly in the mining industry.

In a reply received recently  from  the  Deputy  Minister  of  Minerals  and
Energy to a question which I put to the Minister in October  last  year,  it
is confirmed that mining licence number ML 1/2000, Permission to  Mine  Dune
Sand on Lot 1197, was granted to a group whose members, and I  quote,  ``...
can be classified as historicallly disadvantaged South Africans''. We  would
normally celebrate such  an  action.  However,  it  has  become  clear  that
realising her well-intended anxiety to make  progress,  others  saw  fit  to
misinform  the  Minister  and  to  allow  the  concept  of  black   economic
empowerment to be abused.

It is firmly believed that political strings were pulled by well-off  people
at the expense of the local disadvantaged community. It has  been  confirmed
that the land restitution claim was  timeously  submitted  on  the  land  in
Macassar to which the mining licence is  related.  The  claim  has  been  on
record since early 1996. Does this  not  warrant  an  investigation  of  the
matter?

The CC members lost  no  time  in  commencing  the  mining  activities.  The
housing department of the Western Cape, which is  the  registered  owner  of
the land, was hastily  persuaded  to  ignore  the  fact  that  the  land  is
classified as agricultural. [Time expired.]

            POLICE UNCOVER BOEREMAG PLAN TO MURDER NELSON MANDELA

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M S BOOI (ANC): Hon Chairperson, the work of the police  to  uncover  the
Boeremag plan to murder Nelson Mandela shows the extent to which the  police
are working - round the clock - to  prevent  the  chaos  that  the  Boeremag
would like to create in this country.

The aim of these evil-minded persons is to take us back  and  create  racial
polarisation.  I  want  to   congratulate   the   Minister,   the   national
Commissioner and the policemen and -women who are working day and  night  to
trace these anarchists. Their backbone is broken, but people must  be  aware
that  these  people  will  still  be  able  to  engage  in  isolated  stupid
activities. We hear that these people have a hit list of people  and  police
officials they want to kill. Can the Minister  really  assure  us  that  our
people in the citizenship are protected?

                        GANGSTERISM ON THE CAPE FLATS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L M GREEN (ACDP):  Chairperson,  the  recent  violent  deaths  of  Tyrone
Steenkamp  and  Michaela  Appolis  made  front-page  news  and  robbed   the
community of Steenberg. The Mayor of Cape Town has reportedly called on  the
community to stand up against the gangs in our communities.  Gangsterism  is
a plague on the Cape Flats that has been  allowed  to  flourish  unhindered.
There is a war raging in our streets and the body count is mounting daily.

The safety and security of our communities is the  prime  responsibility  of
Government. The community should not live in constant fear and terror  under
the siege of rival gangs who have defined themselves by  their  actions  and
by inflicting pain and suffering upon the communities  they  come  from.  In
many of our communities there is complete anarchy  and  disrespect  for  the
law, so much so that large parts of the Cape Flats remain no-go arrears  for
policemen and law enforcement agencies.

The very nature  of  gangsterism  and  the  problems  it  presents  for  the
community means the Government should be prioritising this  problem  in  its
latest capacity budget allocation and resource distribution.

The Prevention of Organised Crime Act as it currently  stands  is  also  not
enough as  we  need  specific  legislation  to  give  both  law  enforcement
agencies and the judiciary  greater  powers  in  outlawing  gangsterism  and
enforcing such law with stiff sentences and penalties. I thank you.

                        DEVELOPMENT OF FILM INDUSTRY

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr  P  H  K  DITSHETELO  (UCDP):  Chairperson,  our  country  is   currently
experiencing job losses as it would seem that the Government's focus on  job
creation and prevention strategies is on the other sectors of our economy.

These sectors in question do not include  strategies  to  create  employment
opportunities in the arts  and  culture  sector,  in  particular,  the  film
industry.

Despite its potential to attract direct  foreign  investment  and  stimulate
our country,  thereby  creating  jobs,  we  have  not  heard  of  any  major
programmes in this regard as far as this sector is concerned. If  there  are
any plans, when will these plans be implemented?

                       OVERCROWDING IN PATENSIE PRISON

                            (Member's Statement)

Rev A D GOOSEN (ANC): Chair, I would like to bring to the attention  of  the
House the state of overcrowding  that  exists  in  the  Patensie  Prison  in
Gamtoos Valley in the Eastern Cape.

During my recent visit to my constituency, I visited the prison  to  get  to
know the conditions that are  prevailing  there.  I  first  met  the  prison
authorities and I was told that the prison was  170%  overcrowded  and  that
they were expected to manage the overcrowded conditions as best they  could.
I was then accompanied to all the  cells  and  what  I  saw  shocked  me.  I
counted no less than 80 inmates crammed into a cell.

I  support  the  notion  that  offenders  should  be  imprisoned,  but   the
conditions under which they are incarcerated  should  help  to  rehabilitate
them. The imprisonment of people who committed minor  offences  to  a  great
extent exacerbates the conditions at the said  prison.  A  way  of  bringing
relief  to  the  overcrowded  conditions  is  to  put  these  people   under
correctional supervision rather than for them  to  be  imprisoned.  This,  I
believe, will go a long way to relieving conditions in the prison.

I therefore call on the Minister of  Correctional  Services  in  conjunction
with other relevant Ministries to seek ways to address  this  problem  as  a
matter  of  urgency.  The  aim  should  be  to  eradicate  overcrowding  and
improving conditions, not only in the Patensie Prison, but also  in  prisons
throughout the country.

Lastly, I would like to have more information on  the  recently  established
task team dealing with overcrowding in prisons. I thank you.

                 ZIMBABWE'S SUSPENSION FROM THE COMMONWEALTH

                            (Member's Statement)
Mrs G M BORMAN (DA):  Chairperson, the  DA  supports  the  decision  of  the
Councils of the Commonwealth to have Zimbabwe's suspension remain  in  place
until December,  when  the  Commonwealth  Heads  of  Government  meeting  in
Nigeria will review Zimbabwe's position.

Whilst President Thabo Mbeki and the South African Government continue  with
their quiet diplomacy, ordinary citizens who are exercising their  right  to
peaceful demonstrations and strikes are being beaten up  and  put  in  jail.
Women taking part in a peaceful demonstration to  commemorate  International
Women's Day, carrying placards denouncing abuse  of  human  rights  and  the
suffering they are  subjected  to  as  a  result  of  food  shortages,  were
violently attacked by riot police.

The Zimbabwe Standard reports that women,  some  of  them  carrying  babies,
were kicked and beaten with baton  sticks,  while  a  group  of  about  five
policemen took turns to beat an elderly woman  as  she  lay  on  the  ground
pleading for mercy.

Yesterday the opposition, MDC, called for a national  protest  demanding  an
end to state repression, economic  mismanagement  and  corruption.  The  MDC
said in press advertisements that the majority of Zimbabweans are  wallowing
in poverty and more than 8 million people are staring death in the eyes.

According to a police spokesperson, 63 people were arrested.  The  DA  calls
on President Mbeki  to  change  his  stance  on  Mugabe  in  line  with  the
Commonwealth ban. I thank you.

                              CRIME SYNDICATES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E T FERREIRA (IFP): Chair, a total of US$ 226 750, which  is  about  R1,8
million in South African money, in counterfeit currency was  confiscated  in
South Africa last year. We are now ranked seventh in the world in  terms  of
producing counterfeit US banknotes.  Internationally,  we  are  also  ranked
high on fraud-related crimes and are  seen  as  a  major  centre  for  drug-
trafficking.

One of the reasons South Africa  is  being  targeted  as  a  crime  base  by
international  crime  syndicates  is  as  a  result  of  our  good  economic
infrastructure and banking system that we  have  in  place.  We  cannot  let
criminals and the various international crime syndicates have their way  and
use our country as base from which  to  launch  their  criminal  activities.
Drastic steps have to be taken to stop  the  situation  from  getting  worse
than it already is.

The  relevant  authorities  within  South  Africa  therefore  need  to  work
together  with  the  various  international  crime-fighting   agencies   and
organisations to put an  immediate  stop  to  this  criminal  activity,  and
therefore also stop South Africa from fast becoming an  international  crime
capital.

                              WOMEN IN SCIENCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S L DITHEBE (ANC): Chairperson,  on  7  March  2003,  the  Department  of
Science and Technology launched the South African Reference Group  on  Women
in Science. The objective  for  this  reference  group  is  to  address  the
inadequate involvement of women in science and technology.

It will play  a  key  role  in  policy  and  strategy  relating  to  women's
participation in science and technology - from their early  subject  choices
in schools to the career obstacles they face in the science system.

On the same  day  the  Department  of  Education  also  launched  the  Girls
Education Movement. Central to the objectives of GEM  is  the  encouragement
of girls to get into careers that were traditionally meant  for  boys,  with
specific reference to science.

Chairperson, these are practical initiatives that seek  to  ensure  that  we
respond  appropriately  to  the  fact  that  women  constitute  52%  of  our
country's population and their effective participation in the  economy  will
contribute very significantly, in our programme of united  action,  to  push
back the frontiers of poverty.

It would be appreciated, Chairperson, if  the  two  Ministers  could  inform
this House and the nation as to how they hope  to  co-ordinate  and  monitor
these very important  initiatives  that  have  the  potential  to  form  the
backbone of our country's economy.

                          DA LEADER IN WESTERN CAPE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND  (NNP):  Thank  you,  Mr  Chair.  The  NNP  notes  the  profound
statements by Theunis Botha, new DA leader in the  Western  Cape.  Mr  Botha
said that the DA should not just be  a  party  of  criticism.  He  says  co-
operation with the ANC is  going  to  be  necessary  and  that  the  old  DP
ideology of being opposition has reached the ceiling.

Apart from his predictable criticism of the NNP leader to cover himself,  he
accused his own leader, Tony Leon, of being politically childish,  referring
to the way in which he dealt with the political fall-out between the DP  and
the NNP.

Mr Botha said he is equally sure that the  DA  must  propagate  more  social
democratic ideals, rather than just neo-liberal capitalistic ones.  He  also
calls for more state intervention, and says the task is to create a  culture
of co-operation instead of just showing up the differences.

The NNP believes that Mr  Botha's  statement  serves  as  confirmation  that
under the poor leadership of the hon Leon,  the  DP/DA  has  become  nothing
more than a yapping chihuahua.

Mr Botha should, however, know by now that to  criticise  for  the  sake  of
criticising is the platform on which the DP/DA is built. His statements  are
another example of the deep divisions in the DA, and the lack  of  a  common
policy framework. Thank you.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Does any Minister wish to  respond  to
a statement directed at him or concerning ...

An HON MEMBER: There are women Ministers present.

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Sorry!  ...  directed  at  him  or  her  or
concerning the Minister's portfolio? I recognise the Minister of  Trade  and
Industry, followed by the Minister of Sport and Recreation, followed by  the
Minister of Finance.

                        DEVELOPMENT OF FILM INDUSTRY
                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY: Thank you,  Chairperson.  I  would  just
like to inform the hon member who talked about film that it is not  correct,
there are a number of initiatives dealing with film and the  development  of
film in South Africa. There's a national film trust set up  under  Arts  and
Culture. We have a joined action group  in  DTI  dealing  with  exports  and
promotion of film, and generally with media and visual media.

There's a great deal that's already happening. I'd advise the  Minister  ...
the hon member - maybe he'll be a Minister one day - that next Wednesday  we
open the resource centre on the sixth floor of DTI. You'll  be  able  to  go
there and get assistance and go in and find all these  programmes  yourself;
go back to your community and start a  thriving  film  industry.  Thank  you
very much.

                               KENYAN CRICKET

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SPORT AND RECREATION: Thank you very much, Deputy  Chair.  I
would like to thank Mlangeni, although he didn't finish his  statement,  for
raising that important issue with regard to Kenya. I fully agree  with  him.
I am sure the entire cricketing community are taking note of  the  brilliant
feats by  the  Kenyans.  Indeed,  all  of  Africa  can  be  proud  of  their
achievements.

Although our own Proteas did not  live  up  to  expectations,  Africa  as  a
continent has been established as a leading light within world cricket.

I would like to remind hon members that Kenya has a long  playing  tradition
in cricket, and as a country, our first contact with the Kenyans go back  to
1956. Some of the people sitting on those benches don't  know  that.  Forty-
seven years ago, when a Kenyan team toured here as guests of  the  nonracial
South African Cricket Board of Control, Ellis was probably  this  high.  Two
years later we reciprocated by visiting Kenya under the leadership of  Basil
D'Oliveira, who was  forced  thereafter  to  play  his  cricket  in  England
because of apartheid.

Therefore, I just wanted to say that we  are  all  fighting  for  Kenya,  in
Kenya's corner, that  they  be  given  cricket  test-playing  status.  South
Africa has raised that already, and we hope that within one year they'll  be
able to be given that test status. Thank you very much.

                          DISPUTING OF MEDIA REPORT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank you, Chairperson. The hon Kalyan and the  hon
Camerer are clearly speaking to something they read in the  newspapers.  The
hon Camerer wasn't here yesterday, but the hon Kalyan was. And how come  she
didn't hear what I said? Because what  I  said  was  clearly  not  what  the
newspaper reported. What I said is contained in Hansard today,  and  because
it's in Hansard I think that both of  their  questions  are  in  utmost  bad
faith in the way in which they were put.

Chairperson, the issue that I raised yesterday,  as  contained  in  Hansard,
and I quote it again, ``I think that there is a lot of voodoo  being  spoken
here by the likes of Smith,'' is not the same as the  headline  in  Business
Day. So why do they get it so wrong? They get  it  so  wrong,  because  they
refuse to listen. [Interjections.]

The issues at play are that you require  a  complete  regime  of  treatment,
with the bulk of spending being on the prevention side,  and  clearly  along
the lines all the way through to  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  which
includes home-based care. That's what I said yesterday; that's  what  I  say
today; that's what  the  GCIS  put  out  today.  As  Government  policy,  it
includes the provision of antiretrovirals, but it  isn't  antiretovirals  at
the complete exclusion of everything else. To take that view is  the  bunkum
I referred to yesterday, it's the bunkum  I  referred  to  today,  it's  the
bunkum I'll refer to tomorrow. I said you need a treatment  regime  that  is
medically appropriate and these hon members  must  please  not  mislead  the
House. Thank you. [Applause.]

                          GANGSTERISM ON CAPE FLATS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY: I am sure the hon Green  is  aware  of
activities that are happening in the Cape Flats as we speak. I am sure  he's
aware that there are quite a number of people who have been  arrested  as  a
result of those operations. I do also  want  to  indicate  that  we  discuss
today how we take this programme further.

I was in a meeting where the Premier of the Western Cape, Mr  Marthinus  van
Schalkwyk, was present, the MEC for Community Safety in  the  Western  Cape,
Leonard Ramatlakane, the Minister of  Defence,  the  national  Commissioner,
and one of our deputy national commissioners, Commissioner Bruys. We  had  a
meeting just before we came into the House today  to  discuss  how  we  will
take further our programme to deal with gangsterism on the Cape Flats.

The issue of urban terror in South Africa is a matter  that  worries  us  no
end at Safety and Security,  but  we  are  not  going  to  allow  anyone  to
terrorise our people and members of the Boeremag know this. There is a  case
that is going to start - it must have already started today - on  the  19th,
no, 19 May, against members of the Boeremag that we arrested. We mounted  an
operation a few days ago on the basis of information we  had,  and,  indeed,
as a result of that information we found a hit  list  of  people  that  they
want to eliminate.
I want to repeat what we said last year, that the  safety  and  security  of
our people is at the core of the mandate that we have, and we are not  going
to allow anybody to threaten that safety and  security  of  our  people.  It
does not matter who they are, we will deal with them. [Applause.]

                           OVERCROWDING IN PRISONS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Thank you, Chairperson. Well, I  must
say that the  concern  raised  by  the  hon  member  Rev  Van  Rooyen  about
overcrowding is a legitimate one,  and  he  did  bring  this  matter  to  my
attention recently. I still owe him a status report on  that,  because  that
is part of his constituency - the prison he was talking about.

Currently, we are standing at prison capacity of about 110 000, and we  have
over 187 000 prisoners at the moment. We are overcrowded  by  about  76 000,
and more than 57 000 of those are unsentenced prisoners. We can see that  if
we can get rid of  that  backlog,  then  we  can  have  room  for  sentenced
prisoners.

I must also say that overcrowding is  a  worldwide  phenomenon,  it  is  not
really unique to South Africa; it's a  worldwide  phenomena.  It  does  also
assess certain factors indicating trends of crime, the effectiveness of  the
police and so on.

Hon member Booi just said that they are happy  about  the  effectiveness  of
the police. Now, the police arrest thousands of people, or criminals,  on  a
weekend or in a few days in all the provinces, and the police  service  does
not have prisons - they don't run prisons. They send  all  these  people  to
prisons. I spoke about more than 57 000 unsentenced prisoners, and  that  is
the responsibility of the courts, and the courts don't  have  prisons.  They
don't run prisons. Those people stay in prison and  await  their  court  day
while they are still in prison. This  is  a  disconcerting  feature  of  our
prison system, the overcrowding, and it does a lot of harm to  some  of  the
prisoners.

         COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTITUTION OF SOUTH AFRICA AMENDMENT ACT
                               (Announcement)

The CHAIRPERSON OF  COMMITTEES:  Order!  With  reference  to  the  Speaker's
earlier announcement concerning the implementation of  the  crossing-of-the-
floor legislation, I can now announce that the  President,  by  proclamation
in the Gazette, has fixed 20 March 2003 as the date on which the  Act  comes
into operation. The window period therefore commences at 00:00 on Friday  21
March 2003, that is immediately after midnight on Thursday night.  Completed
forms should not be presented until the window period has opened.

          APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONERS TO NATIONAL YOUTH COMMISSION

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, on behalf of the  Chief  Whip  of  the  Majority
Party, I move the draft resolution printed in his name on the  Order  Paper,
as follows:


  That, subject to the concurrence of the National  Council  of  Provinces,
  the request from the Minister in The Presidency regarding the appointment
  of Commissioners to serve on the National Youth Commission - the term  of
  office of the current commissioners comes to an end on 30 June 2003 -  be
  referred to the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of  Quality  of
  Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons for consideration
  in terms of section 4 of the National Youth Commission Act, 1996 (Act  No
  19 of 1996), the Committee to report by 28 May 2003.

Agreed to.

                 FOOD RELIEF ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson,  the  2002  adjustment  estimates  set
aside R400 million for emergency food  relief  for  vulnerable  groups.  The
amount was not allocated at that time to any particular  department  because
the department was still investigating appropriate interventions  through  a
series of technical committees.

Now we are  in  a  position  to  indicate  that  the  Department  of  Social
Development, for the current fiscal year, will receive R230 million for  the
provision of food parcels and  starter  packs.  The  Department  of  Foreign
Affairs will receive a R170 million to assist with feeding under  the  World
Food Programme in Southern Africa.

I hereby table  the  Food  Relief  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill  and  an
explanatory memorandum on the objects of the Bill.

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance  for  consideration  and
report.

     GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTINGENCY RESERVE ACCOUNT DEFRAYAL BILL

                               (Introduction)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, I think that the Bill  is  incorrectly
named on the Order Paper. It is the Gold and  Foreign  Exchange  Contingency
Reserve Account Defrayal Bill. There is no ``control''  in  the  name.  It's
not foreign exchange control. That is for the record.

Sections 25 to 27 of the South African Reserve  Bank  Act  provide  for  the
management by the Reserve  Bank  of  a  gold  price  adjustment  account,  a
foreign  exchange  adjustment  account  and  a  forward  exchange  contracts
adjustment account.  Profits  and  losses  arising  are  recorded  on  these
accounts and accrue to the Government.

The South African Reserve  Bank  Act  provides,  in  section  28,  that  the
balances shall be transferred at the close of each  financial  year  to  the
gold and foreign exchange contingency reserve account still managed  by  the
Reserve Bank on behalf of the Treasury. Any debit  balance  is  a  loss  for
Government and shall be a charge against the National Revenue Fund.

The balance on this account on 31 March 2002 was a debit amount  of  R28,024
billion. This amount is subject to an audit  investigation  currently  under
way. The debit balance has accrued since 1995-96, when the account was  last
settled largely as a  result  of  losses  incurred  in  the  bank's  forward
exchange operations. At times  the  bank's  provision  of  forward  exchange
cover has exceeded its foreign assets by a wide margin, resulting in  losses
during the  periods  of  rand  depreciation.  By  agreement,  the  bank  has
steadily reduced this  exposure  in  recent  years.  The  net  open  forward
position has declined from a  high  of  R23,2  billion  in  1998  to  R1,500
billion rand billion as at 31 January this year.

In the context of this progress, the bank and the Treasury  have  agreed  to
settle the outstanding balance on the GFECRA, as we call the  account,  over
a  four-year  period  subject  to  the  findings  of   the   current   audit
investigation. An amount of R7 billion  will  be  charged  to  the  National
Revenue Fund in the present fiscal year which ends on 31  March.  An  amount
of R21,024 billion will be charged over  the  next  three  financial  years.
Parliamentary approval is accordingly sought  as  regards  the  defrayal  of
these losses on the gold and foreign exchange  contingency  reserve  account
as a direct charge against the National Revenue Fund.

I hereby table the Gold and Foreign  Exchange  Contingency  Reserve  Account
Defrayal Bill and an explanatory memorandum on the objects of the  Bill  for
consideration. [Applause.]

Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance  for  consideration  and
report.

                HUMAN RIGHTS AS A PILLAR FOR NATION-BUILDING
                          (Subject for Discussion)

Mr O BAPELA: Chairperson, once again we take the august podium to speak  out
on the tragedies that befell our country on 21 March 1961  at  the  township
called Sharpeville east of Vanderbijlpark, when 69  people  were  shot  dead
with Sten and machine guns and hundreds more were  maimed  and  injured  for
refusing to carry one piece of document called a dompass that degraded  them
as equal human beings. Theirs was a demand  to  be  treated  as  humans  and
citizens in their country of birth. Theirs was indeed a fight for  political
freedom.

As we remember and celebrate the event, our  thoughts  go  to  the  victims'
families, their communities in Sharpeville and Langa townships  and  to  the
nation as a whole. It was one of the many tragedies that  characterised  the
type of society and divisions that we were living  under,  in  the  racially
divided apartheid South Africa.

As I was preparing my speech, I stumbled upon  a  heap  of  information  and
documented history, press cuttings and polemics  which  described  the  said
event. It was not only Sharpeville and Langa townships  that  were  affected
by such a calamity, but the country witnessed many  more  massacres  of  the
same magnitude in later years and to mention  a  few:  the  1976,  June  16,
students' uprisings; the Uitenhage, Mamelodi, Alexandra, Boipatong,  Umlazi,
Gugulethu massacres, and the list goes on.

It was not only that, I also stumbled upon a list  of  deaths  in  detention
and names such as Dr Neil Agget,  Steven  Bantu  Biko,  Edwin  Cele,  Ernest
Moabi Dipale, Dr Hoosen Mia Haffejee, Nicodemus Kgoathe,  Mathews  Mabalane,
Abdul Imam Haron, Lucky Kutumela, Phakamile  Harry  Mabija,  Zungwane  Jacob
Mashabane, Caleb Mayekiso, Dumisane Mbatha, Joseph Mdluli,  Manana  Mgqweto,
Eric  Mntonga,  Joseph  Mogotsi,  Mohapi  Mapetla,   Thabo   Mosala,   Peter
Nchabeleng,  Batwanda  Ndondo,  Lawrence  Ndzanga,  Saul   Ndzumo,   Andries
Raditsila, Ahmed Timol and others.

It is  to  the  memory  of  the  Sharpeville  victims,  those  who  died  in
detention, those who were massacred  or  assassinated  and  others  that  we
dedicated 21 March as Human Rights Day. I read  the  names  deliberately  to
remind ourselves the long walk that we travelled to freedom and to  indicate
the nature of Draconian laws that  violated  human  rights.  We  should  not
forget all those who were hanged, assassinated;  those  thousands  who  were
detained without trial; those who perished  on  the  battlefields  and  were
buried in shallow or mass graves in some parts of our country; and the  many
millions of the masses who  were  subjected  to  the  most  degrading  human
conditions, disregarded as human beings, had  their  dignity  stripped  away
and were without honour because they were regarded  as  commoners,  subhuman
and uncivilised.

We said at the time to those of our heroes who died  in  the  struggle  that
``their blood will nourish the tree of liberation.''  Indeed  the  tree  has
been nourished and the dignity of our people is restored and our freedom  is
won.

In 1955 the ANC accelerated and championed the struggle for the  restoration
of human  rights  and  freedom,  and  adopted  the  Freedom  Charter,  which
declared for all our country and the world to know that  our  country  would
never be prosperous or free until all our people lived  in  brotherhood  and
sisterhood, enjoying equal rights and opportunities.  I  quote  one  of  the
clauses: ``All national groups shall have equal  rights''.  That  clause  of
the Freedom Charter continues to elaborate as follows:


  There shall be equal status in the bodies of state, in the courts and  in
  the schools for all groups and races.

Indeed, the ANC Government is achieving this noble goal.


  All people shall have equal rights to use  their  own  languages  and  to
  develop their own folk culture and customs.

The ANC Government is achieving that and all languages  are  now  equal  and
are being developed further.


  All national groups shall be protected by law against  insults  to  their
  race and national pride.

We are doing exactly that under the ANC Government.


  The preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and
  contempt shall be a punishable crime.

We are indeed implementing that through  our  project  of  nonracialism  and
nation-building.

Our new Constitution expresses itself adequately on all the rights  that  we
enjoy in a democratic society as enshrined in  chapter  2  of  the  Bill  of
Rights. The opening phrase of the Bill says:


  The Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of  democracy  in  South  Africa.  It
  enshrines the rights of all our people in our  country  and  affirms  the
  democratic values of our human dignity, equality and freedom.

Briefly, we have described those rights  as  equality;  human  dignity;  the
right to life; freedom and security  of  the  person;  an  end  to  slavery,
servitude and forced labour; right to privacy; freedom of  religion,  belief
and opinion; freedom of  expression,  assembly,  demonstration,  picket  and
petition; freedom of association; political rights; citizenship; freedom  of
movement and residence; freedom of trade, occupation and profession;  labour
relations; environment; property; housing;  health  care,  food,  water  and
social  security;  children's  rights;  education;  culture  and   language;
cultural, religious and linguistic communities; access to information;  just
administrative action; and access to courts.  All  these  rights  are  being
enjoyed by our people under the ANC Government. We call  on  our  people  to
honour, respect and rise to the challenge, and also to note that all  rights
come with obligations.

We have even created bodies or institutions as directed by chapter 9 of  the
Constitution  and  should,  however,  move  to  establish  a   section   185
institution. That is the Commission for  the  Promotion  and  Protection  of
Rights of Cultural, Religious  and  Linguistic  Communities.  I  received  a
report  that  preparations  are  at  an  advanced  stage  to  establish  the
commission, which will further strengthen  our  resolve  and  guarantee  our
noble vision of nation-building.

Not everybody, however, is enjoying all their rights  because  they  do  not
have all the means and are constrained by economic conditions  and  factors.
We still have in our country blacks who are in the majority  and  poor,  and
whites who are few and rich because of the past unequal distribution of  the
country's resources and wealth. I am aware that some  members  do  not  like
this analogy, which  is  nothing  else  but  the  truth,  because  when  the
President presented this in the two-nation theory debate he was  accused  of
being racist.  We  must,  all  of  us,  acknowledge  the  problems  that  we
inherited as a country, tell the truth  as  it  is  and  engage  in  finding
solutions. The two-nation theory is there and we cannot hide it. It  is  not
about racism, but a factual matter that the wealth of the country is in  the
hands of a few people.

I was born and grew up in a township called Alexandra. To date, I  am  still
associated with this  very  poor  community,  which  is  situated  north  of
Johannesburg, where people scavenge for food in  dustbins,  live  in  shacks
and in overcrowded conditions and dwellings.  Just  next  door,  across  the
street, a three-minute drive from Alexandra, is the affluent Sandton,  where
the majority are white, rich and live lavishly.

Children in Alexandra and people of Alexandra  aspire  to  live  like  those
across the street. That street is the N1 freeway to Pretoria  which  divides
the two places. They see a better life for which  they  can  only  wish  and
hope as the means to live that life are  limited  and  constrained  by  many
factors, most of which are not of their own creation. They wish  they  could
also have houses with swimming  pools,  big  yards,  two  or  more  vehicles
outside their houses, the best shops, etc. As they wish for  a  better  life
and full rights, the community next door to  them  does  not  even  care  to
help, support or uplift them in their hopes and wishes.
The Government has allocated R1,3 billion to better the life of  the  people
of Alexandra and to ensure that they also enjoy some of the  full  rights  -
economic and social rights - enjoyed by their counterparts. I wonder if  the
people of Sandton, with the exception of a few, ever think of  reaching  out
as part of nation-building to those poor and hungry next door.

Nation-building is not only about equal rights or human rights, but it  must
be stretched to include economic and  social  rights.  All  national  groups
should reach out to the poor and not only  pity  them  or  derive  joy  from
their state of poverty  and  only  react  by  blaming  or  saying  that  the
Government is not doing enough or that it does not care or deliver,  whereas
the record of delivery is visible for all to see. We must help the  children
of Alexandra and other parts of our country that are  afflicted  by  poverty
not only to aspire to certain things, but to  make  their  dreams  possible.
The Government is contributing to this nation-building.

The ANC, at its Stellenbosch national conference, recommitted itself to  our
strategic  objective  goal  of  reconstruction  and  development   for   the
eradication of the legacy of colonialism and  apartheid.  It  indicated  the
tasks that we have to accomplish to reach this strategic goal  and  see  our
people enjoying their full rights.

The 8 January ANC statement says and I quote:


  When our people attained their freedom in 1994, they inherited a  country
  with millions of people afflicted by poverty.  These  masses  had  fought
  both for their emancipation from oppression  and  their  liberation  from
  poverty.

Among other things, the Stellenbosch declaration which was  adopted  by  the
51st national conference of the ANC said;


  ...  recognising  that  these  efforts  directed  at  reconstruction  and
  development cannot bear fruit if carried by Government and the ANC alone.

The conference reiterated the position of the ANC that is  to  build  strong
links  with  community  organisations,  trade  unions,   religious   bodies,
business  organisations,  women,  youth  structures   as   well   as   other
organisations in order to ensure that, in actual  practice,  South  Africans
act as their own liberators.  This  is  a  call  for  the  mobilisation  and
strengthening of a broad front for construction  and  development,  that  we
must act together as a nation to achieve our strategic goal.

The  ANC  has  always  been  guided  by  the  noble  revolutionary   ideals,
objectives and a vision of a united,  nonracial,  nonsexist  and  democratic
society. This is the principle that guides the ANC  in  the  nation-building
project.  However,  nation-building  involves  other  strategic  goals   and
objectives such as reconstruction and development. Central to  this  is  the
eradication of poverty, and dealing with the eradication of  the  legacy  of
colonialism and  apartheid.  Nation-buildng  is  about  the  building  of  a
prosperous South Africa and improving our people's lives for the better.

In conclusion I would like to say, yes, human rights are indeed one  of  the
pillars  of  nation-building.  Nonracialism,  nonsexism,  united  democracy,
eradication of poverty, building a  prosperous  country  and  reconstruction
and development are some of the pillars. South Africa's  good  standing  and
record on human rights in the world should and must be upheld.  We  are  the
shining example. We are the exemplary and we are the envy of  other  nations
in the world. As the former President, Nelson Mandela, once  said  when  the
new South African Constitution was launched:


  Never again and never again shall we as South  Africans  witness  such  a
  calamity as happened in Sharpeville and other parts of our country.

[Applause.]

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, by way of remarking, let me just  express  the
hope that this subject - human rights - is not  accorded  the  status  of  a
Cinderella deserving nocturnal attention only.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, on a pretty serious point of order: When the  hon
member Mr Seremane stood up to speak, somebody said  ``die  baas  se  boy''.
Now that is absolutely unparliamentary. I would ask you to try to  find  out
exactly who said it and ensure that that  person  at  least  withdraws  that
statement.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Did any member make that statement?

An HON MEMBER: Too cowardly to admit it! Coward!

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Since nobody is prepared to own up,  I
will appeal to members  that,  firstly,  this  is  a  very  serious  debate.
Secondly, there is a lot of movement in the House and a great deal  of  loud
conversation in the House and I did hear  something,  although  it  was  not
clearly audible  from  here,  there  was  something  said  to  that  effect.
[Interjections.] I would like to ask that members refrain  from  using  that
language when hon members approach the podium. Can we all settle down,  have
some order in the House and continue with what  is  a  very  serious  debate
before us.

Mr M J ELLIS: Chairperson, I am told - and I do not know this for a  fact  -
that  it  might  have  been  the  hon  Mr  Danny  Oliphant  who  said  this.
[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Mr Ellis, we did  ask  the  House  and
since there was no response, I think we have to leave the  matter  where  it
is. We will proceed with the debate.

Mr W J SEREMANE: Chairperson, I hope I will have  my  time  back.  Secondly,
let me help this House. I am not perturbed by  such  petty  nonsense.  I  am
sure your track record will prove you the boss or the boy. I am not  worried
about that. [Interjections.] It  is  like  a  serial  killer  calling  me  a
murderer.

We are gathered here under the dark  cloud  of  imminent  war  in  Iraq  and
conflicts in other parts of the world,  including  various  regions  on  our
continent of Africa. Perhaps South Africa is also  under  pressure  by  some
kind of low-intensity war due to social maladies such  as,  amongst  others,
crime and pandemic decimation and ailments such as HIV/Aids. The nation  and
nations are under threat, so to speak.

Systems of government, including the world order, let alone nations per  se,
have to accept the  fact  that  their  greatest  resources  and  assets  are
nothing less than the human being - the citizen. Each and  every  individual
deserves their rights to be respected, upheld and protected.

As we approach Human Rights Day, we must also remember that  it  is  not  an
occasion only for making whoopee, but an opportunity and  space  so  created
by our Constitution to reflect on our performance as state,  government  and
as citizens.

In short, what is the state of our human rights culture, cutting across  the
socio-political and economic spectrum?  Are  the  pillars,  which  is  human
rights, for  nation-building  sound  and  intact?  What  is  our  collective
contribution towards building and maintaining a  healthy  culture  of  human
rights to serve as a pillar of nation-building? The challenge  becomes  even
more acute when directed to each individual of the collective.

The individual and the collective have to recognise certain truths if  human
rights should serve as a reliable and enduring  pillar  of  nation-building.
These  truths  are  nothing  short  of  the  fact  that  human  rights   are
indivisible and that  such  rights  need  to  be  unflinchingly  upheld  and
protected. Human rights cease to be if they are not written  on  the  hearts
and minds of women and men alike. Constitutions, human rights  charters  and
so on are not  enough  on  their  own.  Without  their  embracement  by  the
citizens and as part of a human culture, or fabric of society, human  rights
are as good as a mirage in the desert.

Practice of these truths, more than the  self-righteous  rhetoric,  is  what
counts. These tenets, like justice, must be seen to be done  at  all  levels
and institutions of society. Can we, all of us, especially you,  the  people
on my right, who claim to be conscious of  these  rights  and  accord  these
same rights, protected by our Constitution, to  all  and  sundry?  Why  must
those with dissenting views be demonised?

You here on my right always purport to be upholders  of  human  rights.  Yet
you are so insensitive and intolerant of different  views,  and  of  beliefs
other than yours. You seeem to have made an addendum to  the  maxim  ``motho
ke motho ka batho'' [a person is a person because of others]. Your  addendum
and addition seems to be ``fela ga ele waetsho'' or ``only when you are  one
of us"; only when you are of our belief systems; only when you  are  one  of
the crowd.

This mindset of treating others as pariahs can never be of any help  towards
building a culture of human rights to serve as a pillar of  nation-building.
Mark you, your own Freedom Charter has rightly declared  that  South  Africa
belongs to all who live in it, disregarding race, colour, creed  or  gender.
[Interjections.] The Constitution enshrines the freedoms of expression,  the
freedoms of belief and the freedom of association. Those  are  the  elements
of human rights. Now's the time to walk the talk.

Considering the escalation of crime,  child  and  women  abuse,  one  cannot
wonder if enough is being done to  foster  and  build  a  culture  of  human
rights. The adage ``umntu ngumntu nga bantu'' [a person is a person  because
of others] undergirds the meaning of a human rights culture. You  cannot  be
when you do not recognise and do not respect the  rights  of  other  people.
[Applause.] If you are  so  unwilling  to  recognise,  respect,  uphold  and
accord other people's rights, then you are nothing  but  very  hypocritical.
Moral regeneration cannot be of much worth if the mindset  of  the  citizens
runs counter to the culture of human rights.

Reflecting on the current threat of war, one is also reminded of  the  abuse
of children as child soldiers. Charity beginning at home, we cannot  turn  a
blind eye to what is happening in some  of  our  African  states,  involving
children in warfare. Such practice is  nothing  but  a  gross  violation  of
human rights. It is just as bad, if I am to remind you, as  necklacing  your
opponents or burning railway  stations  and  infrastructure  simply  on  the
basis of wanting to display your disagreement. Respect for human rights  can
only but bolster the concept of the sanctity of  life  and  the  respect  of
both public and private property.

All our programmes, including programme implementation have  to  be  rights-
driven. That is, they should be viewed  from  a  human  rights  perspective.
That leads us to one crucial area, that of food security.  The  preamble  to
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 states, and I quote:


  ... the recognition of the inherent dignity  and  the  equal  inalienable
  rights of all members of the human family.

Article 25.1 deals specifically  with  the  issue  of  access  to  food  and
adequate nutrition. The foregoing is true and  necessary  to  note,  because
the implications of malnutrition are ghastly. They range from  brain  damage
and stunted growth to reduced mental capacity.

I do not doubt that human rights can be  a  viable  and  achievable  nation-
building block and pillar.  For  that  reason,  human  rights  teaching  and
creating a culture  human  rights  need  to  find  a  place  in  our  school
curricula and institutions  of  learning.  This  is  much  better  and  more
responsible than giving prominence to target shooting  and  glorifying  guns
amongst learners. Violence begets violence. In such a climate  of  violence,
human rights and the sanctity of life become the casualties.

When the chips are down, humankind is quick to  declare  that  human  rights
issues are complex. If that be the case, then grasp this, complex as it  is.
Let me quickly quote what Roosevelt said:

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon member, your time has expired.

Mr W T SEREMANE:


  Unless these rights have meaning here, they have little meaning anywhere.
  Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home,  we  shall
  look in vain for progress in the larger world.

[Applause.]
The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon member, your time had expired.

Ms S C VOS: Chairperson, the IFP has no doubt that, since the advent of  our
democracy in 1994, we have much about which we  can  be  proud  as  we  have
striven to inculcate a culture of respect for human rights  in  our  country
and indeed throughout Africa.

As we rightly focus on our strengths in this regard we must look too at  our
failures and ask ourselves what more we can do. How can we  make  sure  that
these so-called human rights pillars sit on a very solid  foundation  within
our  nation  and  are  not  just  magnificent   ideals   embedded   in   our
Constitution? How can we ensure that these pillars are  not  eroded  and  so
undermined that they eventually collapse?

This discussion today necessitates reflection. For  instance,  have  we  not
failed those exquisite children  who  have  been  so  brutally  murdered  by
ongoing and rampant warfare in our townships? The hon Louis  Green  -  I  do
not see him here now - in  his  statement  to  this  House  today  correctly
articulated the horror of gang warfare and activity  in  our  townships  and
the inadequacy of our existing laws to  address  this  issue.  Have  we  not
failed these grieving parents and have we not failed all the victims of  the
ruthless criminals who continue to terrorise our citizens? Have we not  also
failed  the  criminals  themselves,  many  of  whom  appear  to  be  totally
dehumanised.

Day after day, we are confronted with the facts relating  to  their  ongoing
barbarous acts of savage cruelty. We are faced with the rape  of  women  and
children, murder and mayhem in our villages, towns and cities. We  must  now
surely ask ourselves why we have failed to as yet effectively  expose  these
fellow damaged  citizens  to  constructive  alternatives  to  their  present
lifestyles and why they are not continually at the receiving  end  of  tough
policies and programmes which can attempt to achieve this goal.

For instance, my research for this discussion has revealed information  that
there are an estimated 300 gangs  infesting  the  communities  on  the  Cape
Flats. In Lavender Hill, it is reported that the field  near  the  community
centre is called the battlefield, a neutral patch of turf where people  die.
So perhaps it is time that we outlawed gangs and persons  being  members  of
gangs and that we consider researching similar laws enacted in  America  and
elsewhere. I am referring here, by way of example, to the  so-called  United
States Federal ``Rico'' criminal statute, which  was  specifically  designed
to punish criminal activities by business enterprises.

The IFP would  like  this  Government  to  investigate  the  feasibility  of
enacting legislation specifically dealing with this kind of organised  crime
and criminal conspiracy. Surely we  must  now  consider  criminalising  gang
activity and membership and not just wait, as we have to do now,  for  these
gangs to actually commit their crimes before we can lawfully take action.

Is it not time we actually really started to  think  about  finding  persons
guilty by association? What has this got to do  with  human  rights,  people
will say. Well, just ask the grieving parents on the Cape Flats.

As we serve in this Government, we must accept some of  the  blame  for  the
suffering  which  continues  in  our  communities.  It  is  good  that  this
discussion can hopefully focus our minds more clearly on the work ahead  for
us. Respect for human rights is indeed a pillar for nation-building. At  the
core of our nation are our diverse communities.

The IFP has attempted to look at one such community in  this  debate,  hence
our reference to the suffering of the citizens on the  Cape  Flats  and  the
denial of their human rights by the gangs in their townships.

But, there is also another aspect relating to the human  rights  of  persons
who  choose,  for  instance,  to  live  within  and  align   themselves   to
traditional community structures and their leaderships. As  this  Government
enacts laws for our society as a whole, we once again plead  that  there  is
understanding and sensitivity to the human rights of these citizens  and  an
acknowledgement  that  these  communities   within   themselves   constitute
veritable pillars of our nationhood.

In our desire to make us all equal and  to  pursue  perceptions  of  how  to
enable the attainment of these human rights, the very equality and  freedoms
these persons enjoy now within these traditional communities may  be  denied
them by our actions. You are well aware of  the  issues  about  which  I  am
referring. Thank you.
Mrs S M CAMERER: Chairperson, there  should  be  only  one  focus  for  this
year's Human Rights  Day  and  that  is  the  sustained  wholesale  shocking
violation of human rights and the rule of law  by  our  northern  neighbour,
Zimbabwe. All the fundamental human rights that we South Africans hold  dear
as the pillars for nation-building - as indicated by the hon  Bapela  -  the
right to freedom and security of the  person;  freedom  of  the  media;  the
right to assemble and demonstrate; the freedom to  make  political  choices;
the  right  to  a  fair  trial;  the  right  to  life  itself  -  are  being
systematically violated on a daily basis by President Robert Mugabe and  his
government and have been for months on end on a  huge  and  terrific  scale,
and yet our leaders, and we as Parliament, have failed to  condemn  what  is
happening and demand that these violations cease. We have in fact failed  to
do anything at all, Chairperson. I believe it is time  for  this  Parliament
to wake from its slumber on Zimbabwe.

Madam Speaker, who has shown  an  admirable  independence  of  mind  lately,
should send  a  delegation  on  a  fact-finding  mission  to  establish  for
ourselves the extent of  these  human  rights  abuses  by  speaking  to  our
counterparts from all political parties in  Zimbabwe  and  to  all  relevant
institutions such as the judiciary, government and society.  We  cannot  sit
idly by. We cannot continue like this as  this  catastrophe  unfolds.  Thank
goodness  civil  society  is  beginning  to  make  its  voice  heard.  Brave
Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga retired from  international  cricket  this
week to make the point. He said:


  I would be condoning the grotesque human rights violations that have been
  perpetrated and continue to be perpetrated against my fellow countrymen.

Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane has become involved in what he  calls  ``the
humanitarian crisis'' in Zimbabwe specifically because of the way  the  food
distribution has been  politically  manipulated  by  ZANU-PF.  Nearly  every
South  African  editorial  writer,  black  and  white,  has  condemned   our
Government's failure to intervene in any way.

While we as Parliament blithely continue to ignore the human  rights  crisis
in  Zimbabwe,  and  its  consequences,  the  United  Nations  Human   Rights
Commission, meeting in Geneva this week, will be seized of the matter. A 16-
page document just compiled  by  the  United  States  State  Department  and
launched in Washington last week, blaming Mugabe and his government for  the
humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe, is being tabled at that meeting.

It states among other things that Zimbabwe  is  in  crisis,  that  half  the
population is facing the threat of famine; that up to 2 million  Zimbabweans
have been displaced; that 80% of adults are unemployed;  that  the  rule  of
law has been replaced by the arbitrary and brutal rule of  a  self-appointed
elite. The document fingers the true roots of the crisis as Mugabe  and  his
colleagues in ZANU-PF, who have placed themselves above the  law;  who  have
prospered while 7 million of their compatriots have  reached  the  brink  of
starvation; who have enriched themselves  while  400  000  of  their  fellow
Zimbabweans have lost their jobs.

The document charges that Zimbabweans, whether from  civil  society  or  the
political opposition, who have spoken out  against  the  regime  have  faced
murder, detention, torture and harassment at the hands of  a  brutal  system
of state repression.  It  goes  on  to  declare  oppression  of  the  media;
oppression of political parties; the wrecking of the rural economy  and  the
brutal diversion of food assistance as the causes of the crisis.  Oppression
and the denial of  human  rights  have  gone  hand  in  hand  with  economic
collapse.
Comparative statistics of the past ten years graphically depict the  decline
and fall of Zimbabwe. In 1992 unemployment was at 35%. Today it is  80%.  In
1992, 2,5 Zim dollars could buy a US dollar. Today it is 1 300 Zim  dollars.
Seventy-five percent of  Zimbabweans  live  in  poverty;  7,2  million  face
starvation. With inflation running at 200% food production has  declined  by
85%, per capita income by 50%.

With the economy collapsing there are 100 000  economic  refugees  a  month,
most of whom are coming to South Africa at a rate  of  3  000  a  day,  some
estimate. This is a huge extra burden for our country. We must get  involved
in this crisis.

The United States State Department Research Paper  is  supported  by  recent
research of Unicef which makes clear that the main victims  of  these  human
rights abuses are women and children. Unicef blames specifically  the  fast-
track land settlement programme as  the  leading  cause  of  the  Zimbabwean
economic decline.

Against all the evidence our ANC-led  Government  has  refused  to  raise  a
voice of protest against these  human  rights  abuses  and  their  appalling
consequences. A presidential election which the whole world  now  knows  was
rigged to the extent of at least one million phantom votes was  endorsed  as
free and fair by a parliamentary delegation  from  South  Africa  led  by  -
guess who - none other than the hon or ex-hon Tony Yengeni, and we all  know
that he can be bought. Incomprehensibly, the alleged main  election  rigger,
Emerson Manangagwa, was given a hero's welcome  at  the  ANC's  congress  in
December. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: The hon Madikiza will be  making  his  maiden
speech.

Mr G T MADIKIZA: Mr Chair and hon members, at the outset I wish to extend  a
special word of appreciation to the members  and  staff  of  the  Truth  and
Reconciliation Commission. The  task  was  huge  and  the  emotional  burden
immense, but overall the TRC has fulfilled its duties.

The stagnation of the reparation process as a feature of  reconciliation  is
a matter for serious concern which needs to be dealt  with  as  urgently  as
possible. Today we remember the millions who suffered  human  rights  abuses
under the previous dispensation. We remember their suffering not  only  with
a sense of sadness, but also with an overwhelming pride and joy  that  since
1994 we can claim that we are free at last. It is a bittersweet day.

Human rights has many aspects. Today,  I  wish  to  highlight  two  aspects,
namely, the rights of women and the issue of morality in Government. On  the
issue of women's rights as an important feature  of  human  rights,  Amnesty
International reminds us that more women and girls die each day  because  of
various forms of gender-based discrimination than as a result of  any  other
type of human rights abuse.

In the world, 110 million  school-aged  children,  of  whom  two-thirds  are
girls, still do not have access to education. Over 800  million  adults,  of
whom 60% are women, are illiterate. In South Africa too  the  harsh  reality
is that women suffer proportionally more human rights neglect and abuse.  In
employment,  education  and  domestic  security,  the   vast   majority   of
marginalised  people  are  women.  Government  and  indeed  all  of  us   as
individuals and in communities have a central role in  promoting  the  human
rights culture in society. These rights are enshrined in the Constitution.

Mr Chair, in conclusion, the UDM salutes the millions of South Africans  who
respect human rights and who affirm on a daily basis the  democratic  values
of human dignity, equality and freedom. The lesson we have learned from  the
events on this day 43 years ago in Sharpeville is that  injustice  will  not
disappear of its own accord. It takes courage  to  stand  up,  sometimes  at
great personal cost, to face and fight it. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Chairperson, may I congratulate my  colleague  on  his  maiden
speech today.

Chairperson, there is no doubt that our Constitution and the Bill of  Rights
have played an important role in our nation-building.  Coming  from  a  past
characterised by division and racism, the role of human rights in  restoring
dignity and equality cannot be overemphasised.

The question arises, however, whether every right contained in the  Bill  of
Rights accurately reflects the morals and values of our society. Can  we  in
all sincerity be proud of a Bill of Rights that does not protect  the  right
of life of the unborn, whilst protecting the right to life of murderers  and
child rapists? If we have one of the  most  advanced  constitutions  in  the
world, protecting fundamental human rights,  why  do  the  majority  of  our
people feel unsafe and threatened in  their  homes?  Why  are  our  children
being shot in the streets and so many people facing poverty and  starvation?
Why is antiretroviral  treatment  for  HIV/Aids  not  being  rolled  out  in
accordance with the Constitutional Court order?

A further question relates to the role  of  the  Constitutional  Court  when
interpreting the values enshrined in the Constitution and how legitimacy  is
maintained, particularly when dealing with national moral issues. Few  would
disagree that the judgment prohibiting the death penalty remains one of  the
most unpopular decisions of the Constitutional Court.  It  is  crucial  that
the court be sensitive to public opinion to retain public  support  for  the
exercise  of  its  power,  failing  which  it  may  lose  legitimacy  as  an
institution of South African public life.

Judges who reject public opinion, particularly when  dealing  with  national
moral issues, may be faced  with  the  dilemma  of  counter-majoritarianism.
According to Judge Dennis  Davis,  constitutional  review  is  conducted  by
unelected judges who are empowered to overturn the will of a  democratically
elected and accountable legislature in terms of a  process  of  interpreting
abstract constitutional provisions. In short, the question arises as to  how
to account for and justify the curtailment of the operation of a  democratic
political system to an unaccountable institution.

How can we have a moral regeneration  in  a  climate  of  moral  relativism?
Today the battle to build South  Africa  is  not  only  physical,  but  also
moral. Unless a sufficient number of pro-moral  South  Africans  acknowledge
that fact and are willing to engage in nation-building on a basis of  common
moral conviction, we will not be able to meet the challenges facing us  such
as  HIV/Aids,  rampant  crime  and  corruption,  and  extreme  poverty   and
starvation.

Whilst  we  as  the  ACDP  are  compelled  to  cry  out  against   abortion,
homosexuality, prostitution, pornography  and  other  vices,  we  must  also
reach out loving arms to unwed mothers, Aids patients and orphans,  divorced
partners and children being raised by one parent. If  pro-moral  leaders  of
all religious persuasions stand together as fellow South Africans  concerned
with the preservation of the family and moral decency, we  can,  with  God's
help, succeed in nation-building. I thank you

Nk  P  N  MNANDI:  Sihlalo,  Phini  likaNgqongqoshe,  bahlonishwa,  Maqabane
nezihlobo,  mangivule  inkulumo  yami  ngokucaphuna   isingeniso   emQulwini
weNkululeko yeZwe.

Ngonyaka ka-1955 abantu baseNingizimu Afrika bathi:


  Umhlaba wonke mawazi ukuthi uMzansi Afrika ungowabo bonke  abantu  abakhe
  kuwo,  abamnyama   nabamhlophe.   Akunahulumeni   ongaziqhwagela   umbuso
  ngaphandle kokuthi akhethwe ngentando yeningi.

Abantu  bakithi  baphucwa  amalungelo  abo  okuzalwa  kuleli  zwe.  Baphucwa
inkululeko noxolo. Baphucwa  nguhulumeni  wezinswelaboya  owawakhelwe  phezu
kwesisekelo  esingalungile   nesingalingani.   Izwe   lakithi   ngeke   lize
lithuthuke noma likhululeke ngaphandle kokuthi bonke abantu bakithi  bahlale
ngokuzwana, bathole amalungelo namathuba afanayo.

Umbuso  wabantu  weqiniso  nosekelwe  yintando  yeningi  kuphela  ongavikela
amalungelo   abo   okuzalwa.   Ngakho   thina   bantu   baseMzansi   Afrika,
singabamnyama nabamhlophe,  siyafunga  siyagomela  ukuthi  sizokwenza  ngawo
onke amandla ethu futhi angeke siphumule zingakafezeki lezi zinhloso.

Basho njalo abantu  baseNingizimu  Afrika  ngonyaka  ka-1955  lapho  bebhala
uMqulu weZwe. Phila ingunaphakade Mqulu weNkululeko yezwe!

Uma ngikhuluma  ngokuthi  amalungelo  abantu  ayisisekelo  sokwakha  isizwe,
asikwazi ukungakhulumi  ngamalungelo  abantu  besifazane  ikakhulukazi  labo
abahlala ezindaweni ezisemakhaya.  UKhongolose  uyakholelwa  kakhulu  ukuthi
amalungelo abantu besifazane ayingxenye enkulu yamalungelo  esintu  sonkana.
Lo Hulumeni oholwa nguKhongolose akananazi ngokuthi ngeke nje  aze  aphumule
bengakakhululeki abantu besifazane bakuleli zwe ngokuphelele.

Bakwethu, masiqale  ngalokhu!  Konje  yayinjani  impilo  yabantu  besifazane
basemakhaya  ngaphansi  kukahulumeni  wobandlululo  na?  Abantu   besifazane
basemakhaya babengenamalungelo,  babengenalutho  futhi  babephila  ngaphansi
kobugqila   obuphindaphindiwe.   Babezibonela   kuhle   kwechwane   lenyoka.
Izidingongqangi  ezifana  namanzi  ahlanzekile,  ugesi,  izingcingo  nokunye
kwakungabasemzini. Lihle iqiniso,  amalungelo  abantu  besifazane  ayangekho
nhlobo ohlwini lukahulumeni wobandlululo.

Ngingebuthethe ubulandu ngoba angiganisi. Ngonyaka ka-1994  lagaya  ngomunye
umhlathi kuleli zwe. Imbokodo  kamagayise  yazifikela  qathatha  kule  Ndlu.
UKhongolose wathatha amalungelo abantu  besifazane  wawenza  undabamlonyeni.
Imithetho  yashintshwa  ngokushesha  okukhulu.  [Ihlombe.]  Kuningi  kakhulu
uKhongolose asekwenzile ukuze  kubuye  isithunzi  sabantu  besifazane  lapha
eNingizimu Afrika nase-Afrika yonkana.

Kumanje  nje  ukuthuthukiswa  kwezindawo   zasemakhaya   kuhamba   phambili.
Ngikhuluma nje u-Eskom  unemizi  engangezigidi  ezingu-1,5  nento  asezifake
ugesi emizini yasemakhaya. Omama  nabantwana  abasayi  ukuyotheza.  UmNyango
wezeMpilo  usuwakhe  imitholampilo  engama-700  ezindaweni  zasemakhaya  nje
kuphela.  Ezindaweni  eziningi   amanzi   angenile.   Kuthe   lapho   abantu
bebhuqwabhuqwa isifo sohudo, sambona uNgqongqoshe  wezeMpilo  ephuma  engena
waze wafaka ngisho nezindlu zangasese imbala.

Ukondliwa kwabantwana kubanikile  omama  basemakhaya  ithuba  lokuphefumula.
Kwakhiwe imigwaqo yetiyela, izikhungo zokudayisa, kwathi nesithembu  senziwa
saba semthethweni naso. Lolu hlu lude kakhulu,  ngingeze  ngaluqedela  lapha
njengamanje. Kuthe sinomkhankaso ngakithi, eMkhambathini sihamba  sizwa  uvo
lwabantu ngoba phela lapha kwaKhongolose sinosiko  lokuya  ebantwini  asizwa
ngamaphepha ukuthi abantu bathini, safika emzini womunye ugogo wathi  kithi,
`hawu bantwana bami, ningibongele kuMamlambo  ngoba  namhlanje  sengiyakwazi
ukuya  odongeni,  ngiciphaze  imbungulu  kukhanye  bha  endlini.  [Ihlombe.]
Amehlo agcwala izinyembezi kithi. Sawubona umahluko.

Yebo, mkhulu umahluko olethwe  nguKhongolose  ekuguquleni  izimpilo  zabantu
besifazane ezindaweni zasemakhaya,  kodwa  asiphiki  futhi  ukuthi  kusekude

UBush has gone back to the bush. [Applause.]  (Translation  of  Zulu  speech
follows.)

[Mrs P N MNANDI: Chairperson, Deputy Minister, hon comrades  and  relatives,
I would like to introduce my speech  by  quoting  the  introduction  of  the
National Freedom Charter. In 1955, the people of South Africa said:


  The whole world must know that South Africa belongs to everyone who lives
  in it, whites and blacks. There is no government who can put itself  into
  power without being chosen democratically.

Our people were deprived of their birthright  in  this  country.  They  were
deprived  of  their  freedom  and  peace.  They  were  deprived  by  a  rude
government which was built on the basis of wrongness and inequality.

Our country will neither develop nor be liberated until all our people  live
in harmony, and receive equal rights and opportunities.

It is only a true people's government, which is  based  on  democracy,  that
can protect people's birthright.  Therefore,  we  people  of  South  Africa,
black and white, hereby swear that we will do everything in  our  power  and
that we will not stop until we achieve these objectives.

That is what the people of South Africa said in 1955  when  they  wrote  the
national Freedom Charter. Long live the national Freedom Charter!

When we talk about the fact that rights are the basis upon which the  nation
can be built, we exclude women's rights,  especially  the  rights  of  rural
women. The ANC strongly believes that women's rights are  a  major  part  of
human rights as a whole. This ANC-led Government has no doubt that  it  will
not rest until women are fully liberated in this country.

Good people, let us start with this! How  were  the  lives  of  rural  women
during the apartheid era? Rural women did not  have  rights.  They  did  not
have anything and they lived under a severe form of  slavery.  They  had  to
look  after  themselves.  Basic  needs  like   clean   water,   electricity,
telephones and many other things were not available  to  them.  Telling  the
truth is a good thing. Women's rights were not on the list of the  apartheid
government.

I do not want to talk too much. In 1994  things  changed  in  this  country.
Women represented themselves in this House. The ANC put the  women's  rights
issue on the table for discussion. Laws were  quickly  changed.  [Applause.]
There are a lot of things that the ANC has done  to  return  the  status  of
women in South Africa and in the whole of Africa.

Now the development of the rural areas is at the top of the list.  As  I  am
talking, Eskom has put electricity in  more  than  1,5  million  households.
Women and children do not have to go into the bushes to  collect  wood.  The
Department of Health has built about 700 clinics in the rural  areas  alone.
Water has been supplied in many areas. When people were greatly affected  by
cholera, we saw the Minister of Health visiting many  areas  and  installing
toilets.

The child-support grants have given women some relief. Tar roads  have  been
built. Street tables for selling have been installed, and polygamy has  been
legalised. This is a very long list and I  cannot  mention  all  the  things
here now. When we had a campaign in  the  Mkhambathini  area,  were  I  come
from, we tried to get the people's views, because here in the ANC,  we  have
a culture of going to the people. We do not rely on newspapers. We  went  to
the homestead of a certain old lady and she said: ``Hey, my  children,  pass
on my regards to MaMlambo because today I can go to the  wall  and  press  a
button and the light comes on in the house.'' [Applause.]

Our eyes were full of tears. We saw the difference.

Yes, there is a big difference which the ANC has made  in  changing  women's
lives in the rural areas. But we do not deny that there is still a long  way
to go. In this short  period  since  the  ANC  has  come  to  power,  a  big
difference has been noticed. The ANC will always continue to do this.

We should thank MaMsane. Yes, it was  nice  to  see  women  in  urban  areas
getting their land rights everywhere. But the rural women still do not  have
land rights.

Thank you, good people. Today the Bill on  land  rights  is  on  the  Table.
Rural women will greatly benefit from this Bill.  At  the  moment  they  are
anxiously waiting for it. Another painful thing is  that  nothing  has  been
done towards caring for the rural women with disabilities. They too must  be
fully taken care of. We invite rural women to stand  up  and  work  together
with the Government in fighting for their rights. These rights  were  fought
for with the blood of the heroes and heroines of the struggle.

In conclusion, on Friday here in South Africa, we will be celebrating  Human
Rights Day. It is very painful to think that  women  and  children  in  Iraq
will be avoiding trucks full of soldiers and the bullets of  the  Americans.
[Applause.]]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Chairperson, as we are about to celebrate Human  Rights
Day, we are also reminded of our past and present situation. It  has  to  be
emphasised that we are observing Human Rights Day  within  a  context  of  a
society in transit. We are therefore challenged  to  put  aside  our  party-
political differences if we are serious about nation-building.

To build a nation is not an overnight thing, nor is  there  a  short-cut  to
it. It involves sustained commitment and  sacrifice.  Yes,  our  past  as  a
country is ugly. We have emerged from a severely divided society, but  today
we are a proud nation as a result of how we managed  to  overcome  adversity
to  build  the  country  and  set  it  on  a  new  course.  The   democratic
institutions we have bear hallmark to the nature of our society.

Above all we have a  Constitution  that  is  underpinned  by  human  rights,
values and principles. There is no doubt that it  has  become  the  envy  of
many nations across the world. It is in this Constitution that  our  destiny
is collectively mapped out as a nation.

What do we mean when we  say  that  human  rights  are  pillars  of  nation-
building? We are simply saying and asserting that human rights  have  to  be
recognised and respected as such as  a  first  step  of  our  foundation  to
building a strong and  prosperous  nation.  Human  rights  are  inextricably
linked to the living conditions of  our  people  in  terms  of  whether  the
national resources are equitably distributed for their  benefit.  It  is  on
this basis that the  enrichment  of  human  rights  should  precede  nation-
building.

In reality, it is difficult, if not  impossible,  to  establish  a  coherent
nation if the people are not united in  common  objectives  irrespective  of
their ethnic or  cultural  background.  Therefore,  the  practice  of  human
rights provides the  necessary  foundation  to  initiate  a  nation-building
process. We have to  caution  that  the  existence  of  mere  rights  is  no
guarantee  that  nation-building  will  occur  if  these  rights   are   not
contextualised.

We are  therefore  challenged  to  translate  these  rights  into  something
meaningful or concrete for our people. Human rights  mean  different  things
to different people. It is on this basis that  rights  become  a  pillar  of
nation-building because of  their  broader  appeal  in  terms  of  different
expectations. For example how do we empower our  people  to  exercise  their
economic rights? [Applause.] [Time expired.]

Dr  M  S  MOGOBA:  Deputy  Chair,  21  March,  which  the  PAC  has   called
``Sharpeville Day'' for many years, and which the United Nations  recognised
as the International Day  for  the  Elimination  of  Racial  Discrimination,
might never have happened if the oppressed and dispossessed  people  of  our
country listened to pessimists  and  doubting  Thomases  of  the  liberation
struggle. Fortunately, they listened to the call of the  PAC  and  a  unique
history was made. It is a history written with blood.  That  history  cannot
be erased.

The PAC Positive Action Campaign against pass laws, which had  enslaved  the
African people of this country internationalised apartheid  and  contributed
several  conventions  to  international  law,  including  the  International
Convention on the Suppression and Punishment  of  the  Crime  of  Apartheid,
through which the UN declared apartheid a crime against humanity.

Writing about the  Sharpeville  uprising,  the  renowned  revolutionary  and
writer of The Wretched of the Earth, Frantz Fanon, said:
  The seven days that shook South Africa and the entire  world  from  March
  21st this year have forced an irrevocable turn  in  the  history  of  the
  country. The PAC and the urban proletariat  actively  intervened  in  the
  destiny of their affairs and  ushered  in  a  new  period  in  historical
  perspectives  and  pregnant  with  political   possibilities,   for   the
  democratic movement.

For his part, acting Prime Minister Paul Sauer, speaking in the  absence  of
hospitalised apartheid Prime Minister Verwoerd, on whom there  had  been  an
assassination attempt, declared:


  The old book of South African history closed two months ago and  for  the
  immediate future South Africa will reconsider in earnest and honesty  her
  whole approach to the native question.

As we commemorate this epochal event, we call on all  of  us  to  rededicate
ourselves  to  the  human  rights  of  our  people  and  to  speed  up   the
implementation of  these  rights,  particularly  employment,  food,  health,
education, security, land and unity for all. I thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, democracy and equality  are  what  our  people
yearned and fought for through the apartheid regime. To be one  people  with
no segregation, divisions and ranking meant a society based on democracy.

To ensure this, the  new  democratic  South  Africa  adopted  constitutional
supremacy as a backbone, and enshrined in this Constitution  is  a  Bill  of
Rights that entrenches human rights as law. The two go hand in hand.  For  a
successful democracy there has to be protection and  preservation  of  human
rights. This entails governance by the  people  for  the  people,  in  which
equal representation and participation is practised.

As noted, the purpose of Government is for  the  people,  and  the  Bill  of
Rights governs the relationship between the two, that is the state  and  its
citizenry.  In  regard  to  this,  having  human  rights  enshrined  in  our
governmental structure,  being  a  democracy  and  working  towards  nation-
building, they shall all correlate if the  above  factors  are  successfully
instilled.

We strive to  build  a  working  relationship  between  Government  and  the
people. Human rights have been accommodated in the light of this.  It's  now
the power of the individual to practise such rights.  Nation-building  would
be a greater success with the co-operation of  its  people.  Yet  the  harsh
truth is that elements of racism and other human rights  contraventions  are
still evident in South African society, even though they are  deemed  to  be
illegal, like women and child abuse, rape and killing.

Human  rights,  such  as  entitlement  to  education,   set   standards   to
accommodate an educated nation. Rights to housing  and  health  respectively
are developed too. Rights to dignity, security, individuality, religion  and
so forth, contribute to flexibility and development in the  light  of  this.
Each factor of human rights provided for in our  Bill  of  Rights  does  not
only serve the individual, but the nation as a whole is  set  to  gain  from
it.

Resources, though, hinder this and  the  MF  hopes  that  with  this  year's
Budget these visions may be achieved. Most importantly, the  right  to  life
is a global human rights provision which war threatens as  a  contravention.
The MF hopes for a peaceful resolution to  global  matters  and  that  human
rights should be respected unconditionally, not  only  for  nation-building,
but global growth as well.
The MF agrees that human rights are a pillar of nation-building. Thank  you,
Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Chairperson, this might probably be the  last  speech  made
on behalf of the AEB in this Parliament, as the executive  of  the  AEB  has
decided, and I have already made clear my intentions to  represent  the  new
party, the National Action, as soon as the window period opens.

Ons onderwerp vandag bied die ideale geleentheid om  aan  te  toon  hoe  die
meerderheid van die AEB, sowel as the vennote met wie ons bykans  drie  jaar
lank  onderhandel  het,  konsensus  verkry  het  oor   'n   vars   en   nuwe
posisionering binne die  Suid-Afrikaanse  politiek,  en  daar  is  plek  vir
Dennis Bloem ook.

Dit gaan naamlik in ons onderwerp oor die verhouding tussen  die  geheel  en
die dele, die algemene en  die  partikuliere.  Dit  gaan  in  die  onderwerp
``Menseregte en nasiebou'' oor eenheid, maar ook oor verskeidenheid.

Nasiebou het te doen met 'n gemeenskaplike nasionale lojaliteit,  nie  bloot
van  40  miljoen  gesiglose,  identiteitlose   individue   nie,   maar   van
verskillende kulture, linguïstiese en godsdienstige  gemeenskappe  in  Suid-
Afrika, soos omskryf in ons Grondwet. Menseregte het ook  nie  net  te  doen
met  individuele  regte  nie,  maar  juis  met  die   regte   van   sodanige
gemeenskappe.

Die erkenning van verskeidenheid kom reeds na vore in die feit  dat  die  NA
op Christelike basis gefundeer is, maar  met  erkenning  van  godsdiens-  en
geloofsvryheid. Op hierdie basis rus verder twee sye  van  'n  driehoek  wat
altyd in balans moet wees. Aan die een kant  wil  ons  ons  beywer  vir  die
regte van minderhede in Suid-Afrika, met 'n besondere fokus op  die  belange
van Afrikaans en Afrikaners. Ons is nie skaam om hierdie fokus uit  te  spel
nie. Ons glo dat die belange van  die  verskillende  gemeenskappe  in  Suid-
Afrika in hierdie politieke arena  verteenwoordig  moet  word.  Dit  is  die
partikuliere.

Die ander been van  die  driehoek  is  egter  ons  verbintenis:  Suid-Afrika
eerste; dié van 'n gemeenskaplike lojaliteit tot die land en die welsyn  van
al sy mense. Dit is die algemene.

Tussen hierdie twee is daar 'n wederkerige verhouding. Die  regte  van  elke
gemeenskap  moet  erken,  beskerm  en  bevorder  word.  Alleen   binne   die
geborgenheid van die eie kultuur, taal en godsdiens kan die mosaïek van  die
Suid-Afrikaanse nasie  tot  sy  reg  kom.  Alleen  binne  'n  atmosfeer  van
kulturele en groepsgeborgenheid sal toewyding en lojaliteit tot die land  as
geheel kan gedy. Kulturele ontworteling en vervreemding  maak  van  nasiebou
'n monster en bedreiging.

Aan die ander kant, mag die aandring op hierdie regte nooit wees om  dit  in
isolasie op 'n klein eilandjie te beoefen nie. Dit  mag  nie  'n  saak  wees
van, ``los ons uit om ons ding te doen, en ons los julle uit'' nie. Ons  glo
dat elke steentjie op unieke wyse deel  is  van  die  groter  mosaïek.  Elke
gemeenskap moet sy unieke bydrae lewer  om  van  hierdie  land  'n  leefbare
tuiste vir al sy mense te maak. Elke deel  het  'n  verantwoordelikheid  tot
die geheel. Solank as wat miljoene mense nie basiese  lewensregte  het  nie,
sal die gesofistikeerde  regte  van  gemeenskappe  'n  tweede  plek  op  die
nasionale agenda inneem.

Daarom wil ons nie in die wedstryd van Suid-Afrika apaties by die  huis  bly
en onttrek nie, en wil ons nie op die pawiljoen sit en skree  nie.  Ons  wil
ook nie tienuur die oggend ons eie wedstrydjie op die C-veld speel nie.  Ons
wil die hoofwedstryd op die hoofveld speel, maar ons wil  dit  doen  in  ons
eie kleure, met die beskerming van ons taal, ons kultuur en ons godsdiens.

Dit is waar u die NA gaan vind - in die wedstryd van  Suid-Afrika.  Ek  dank
u. [Tyd verstreke.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Our subject today presents  the  ideal  opportunity  to  indicate  how  the
majority of the AEB, as well as the partners with  whom  we  negotiated  for
almost a year achieved consensus in respect of a fresh and new  position  in
South African politics, and there is room for Dennis Bloem too.

Our subject concerns the relationship between the whole and the  parts,  the
general and the specific. The subject ``Human rights  and  nation-building''
is about unity, but also diversity.

Nation-building has to do with collective national loyalty,  not  simply  of
40 million faceless, identitiless individuals, but  of  different  cultures,
linguistic and religious communities in South  Africa,  as  defined  in  our
Constitution. Human rights do not only concern  individual  rights,  but  in
fact the rights of so-called communities.
Acknowledgement of diversity already surfaces in the fact  that  the  NA  is
based on a Christian foundation, but  while  recognising  religious  freedom
and freedom of belief. Furthermore two sides of  a  triangle  rest  on  this
foundation and they must  always  balance.  On  the  one  hand  we  want  to
endeavour for the rights of minorities in South Africa, with specific  focus
on the  interests  of  Afrikaans  and  Afrikaners.  We  are  not  shy  about
expounding on this focus. We believe that the  interests  of  the  different
communities in South Africa should be represented in this  political  arena.
These are the particulars. The other leg of the triangle,  however,  is  our
association: South Africa  first;  that  of  a  collective  loyalty  to  the
country and the welfare of all its people. This is the general.

Between these two there  is  a  mutual  relationship.  The  rights  of  each
community must be  recognised,  protected  and  promoted.  Only  within  the
security of the own culture, language and religion can  the  mosaic  of  the
South African nation come  into  its  own.  Only  within  an  atmosphere  of
cultural and group security will dedication and loyalty to the country as  a
whole flourish. Cultural displacement and alienation makes a monster  and  a
threat of nation-building.

On the other hand, insisting on these rights may never  be  exercising  them
in isolation on a little island. It may not  be  a  matter  of:  ``Leave  us
alone to our own thing and we  leave  you  alone.''  We  believe  that  each
little stone forms a unique part of the greater mosaic. Each community  must
make its unique contribution to making this country a bearable home for  all
its people. Each part  has  a  responsibility  to  the  whole.  As  long  as
millions of people do not have  basic  rights  in  life,  the  sophisticated
rights of communities will take second place on the national agenda.

Therefore, in the game of South Africa we do not want  to  sit  at  home  in
apathy and withdraw, nor do we want to sit in the stands and shout.  Nor  do
we want to play our own little game on the C-field at  ten  o'clock  in  the
morning. We want to play the main game on the main field, but we want to  do
so in our own colours, with the protection of our language, our culture  and
our religion.

That is where you are going to find the NA - in the game  of  South  Africa.
We thank you. [Time expired.]]

Mr P J NEFOLOVHODWE: Chairperson, it is nine years since the ushering in  of
our new political  dispensation.  Gradually  our  people  are  beginning  to
appreciate  and  exercise  their  political  right  as  guaranteed  in   the
Constitution. We have all become accustomed to demonstrations  and  protests
by the people. Yes, we have come to accept the rights of  our  people  being
exercised in this dispensation.

It was not so yesterday. Then the majority in this country were deprived  of
all civic, democratic and political rights. Black people  were  not  allowed
to manage or even to own businesses. They were  not  allowed  to  air  their
political views. They were not allowed to own their own  houses.  They  were
made foreigners, in other words, in the country of their  birth.  They  were
forced to carry the dompas everywhere they went so it  could  be  determined
if they were allowed to be in urban areas and,  if  so,  whether  they  were
working or not.

The introduction and enforcement of the pass laws  was  the  culmination  of
centuries of degradation and humiliation of black  people  in  this  country
and it was precisely in this period that the people  felt  that  enough  was
enough and poured into the streets in peaceful protest. The  regime  replied
with Saracens and machine guns,  mowing  the  people  down  in  Sharpeville,
Langa and Nyanga. In this way the regime tried to quell the  people's  quest
for true  humanity.  It  is  now  history  that  they  failed.  Yes,  as  we
commemorate the memory of those who fell in the pursuit of the  rights  that
we enjoy today, we should do so in dignity and we should  not  forget  where
we come from.

The rights of our people, as rights in the Constitution, are useless if  our
people do not know them. Our people must know all their rights so that  they
can be able to exercise them. This places a great responsibility on  all  of
us to popularise these rights amongst our  people  so  that  they  could  be
exercised and enjoyed by all citizens. And as we commemorate  this  day,  we
should remember that, all things being equal, those who  have  oppressed  us
are today also enjoying the same rights that we enjoy. It is because we  are
democratic and we are not doing what they did  to  all  of  us.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr S L DITHEBE: Chairperson, I dedicate this debate to all those who  spared
neither strength nor courage and paid the supreme price for  the  liberation
of our  country.  This  democratically  elected  Parliament  of  the  people
remains an indestructible epitaph in honour of our heroes.

The ANC  leadership,  notably  the  then  President-General  Dr  Moroka  and
Secretary-General Walter  Sisulu,  wrote  to  Prime  Minister  Malan  on  21
January 1952 demanding the repeal of unjust laws by 29 February 1952:


  We firmly believe that the freedom of the African people, the elimination
  of exploitation of man by man and the restitution of  democracy,  liberty
  and harmony in South Africa are such vital and fundamental  matters  that
  the government and the public must know that we  are  fully  resolved  to
  achieve them in our lifetime. The struggle which our people are about  to
  begin is directed not against any race or national group but against  the
  unjust laws which keep in perpetual subjection and misery  vast  sections
  of our population.

Predictably, the response of the regime was one of intransigence and  racial
invective which later sparked the  Defiance  Campaign  of  1952.  Ironically
though, the Freedom Charter as adopted in 1955 did not call  for  the  white
man to quit Africa, but declared that South Africa belongs to all  who  live
in it, black and white. Our Constitution is  the  living  testimony  to  the
inclusive and nonracial vision of our forebears.

I now turn to the crucible warriors  of  our  fight  for  human  rights  and
democracy - the youth. Your monumental contribution to  these  freedoms  are
celebrated by all freedom-loving people. At this crucial  hour  of  destiny,
our country and our people  need  you.  Accordingly,  the  future  of  South
Africa is in your hands and you are the architects of its future.

The ingenious programmes and projects of the Umsobomvu  Youth  Fund,  itself
the single largest investment that the Government has made  to  address  the
youth unemployment challenge in South Africa, are giving hope to  our  youth
as demonstrated below: Firstly, 72 unemployed youths from the Western  Cape,
who  have  completed  matric  took  part  in   an   environmental   service,
conservation and outdoor education project; 120 unemployed young people  are
involved in a youth service project in care-giving  and  community  cleaning
on the Cape Flats; 120 young people in  Gauteng  are  involved  in  a  youth
service project in care and counselling for  people  infected  by  HIV/Aids;
169 young people are engaged  in  horticulture  and  construction  at  Crown
Mines in Gauteng; a project for 90 young people to rebuild their  lives  and
their communities after gang violence in Westbury in Gauteng is  going  on;,
550 young people in Mohlaletse Village, Limpopo, are involved in  a  labour-
intensive infrastructure development project;  50  unemployed  young  people
are involved in home-based care and counselling at the Witbank Hospital  for
people living with HIV/Aids; 80 young  people  in  Mothibistad,  North  West
Province, are part of the three youth  service  projects  in  the  areas  of
construction, primary agriculture and primary health care; 100 young  people
are participating in five youth service projects to assist the community  to
react proactively in helping those infected and affected by HIV/Aids in  the
Free State; 330 young people in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and the Eastern  Cape
will be trained as sporting coaches, marketers and  administrators  and  250
young people - listen to this - will benefit over three years  in  a  School
to Work Project to  enable  them  to  access  employment  in  the  financial
Treasury sector.

To  respond  to  the  President's  injunction  for  us  to  create  an   IT-
capacitated nation, 300 unemployed matriculants  in  Gauteng,  KwaZulu-Natal
and the Western Cape are undergoing training in  IT  development  skills  to
provide relevant work experience and meaningful employment.

In addition, 230 young unemployed tertiary graduates in 2003  and  730  over
the next three years will  receive  high-level  technical  and  professional
skills training. [Applause.] All this is in partnership  between  the  State
Information  Technology  Agency,  the  Public  Sectoral  Education  Training
Authority and the Department of Public Service and Administration.

Last,  but  not  least,  the  Youth  Fund  has  committed  R100  million  in
partnership  with  Momentum  and  FNB  to  provide  capital  to  youth-owned
businesses over the next five years for 200 entrepreneurs and raise  another
R100 million for the same project.  This  will  create  and/or  preserve  an
average of 25 jobs per SME financed which equals to 5 000 jobs.

I want to propose that of the R10  billion  set  aside  for  black  economic
empowerment for the next five years in this year's  Budget,  R2  billion  of
that be ceded to the Youth Fund to pursue similar projects as stated above.

Because of the enormity of these  projects,  I  would  like  to  state  that
Umsobomvu is living true to its role of being the  implementer  of  projects
that ensure youth participation in the mainstream of the economy, while  the
National Youth Commission monitors policy and facilitates  legislation.  For
this reason,  we  need  both  these  organisations  in  order  to  heal  the
divisions of the past, deepen human rights and democracy and foster  nation-
building.

I would like, in conclusion, to say that in all these endeavours, our  youth
must not become passive recipients of  rights  and  freedoms,  but  must  be
cadres of a fight to push back the frontiers of poverty in  a  united  front
with Government.

Finally, I must say before I conclude, that the hon Mrs Camerer, who is  not
here unfortunately, has spoken  at  length  about  human  rights  abuses  in
Zimbabwe and how much the United States is going  to  submit  to  the  Human
Rights Commission of the UN a 16-page document which details  atrocities  by
a so-called self-appointed elite in Zimbabwe.  But  what  she  forgets,  and
conveniently so, is that the same United States Government is arming to  the
teeth Sharon, who, I believe, will take advantage of a war against  Iraq  to
commit genocidal acts against Palestinians.

Hon Seremane talked  about  food  security.  I  hope  that  he  watches  his
television set every day or that he reads newspapers or is in a position  to
find valid information, one way or the other.  Last  week  the  Minister  of
Social Development, the Premier of Gauteng and MECs were  distributing  food
parcels to the people of Bekkersdal. We heard harrowing  stories  of  people
that are living in hunger.

But our Government is not oblivious to that reality. We ourselves  know  the
face of poverty and we are not about to betray the  wishes  and  aspirations
of our people. And I would like to say that the false apocalypse  which  the
President spoke about, that the DP is so  fond  of  presenting  our  country
with, must be exposed for what it is.  They  would  have  everybody  believe
that South Africa is in a state of crisis. But all that has been said  today
- the last speaker has confirmed it.

Some of you are sitting here because the  ANC,  the  people's  revolutionary
movement,  was  so  gracious  that  it   brought   about   these   freedoms.
[Interjections.] [Applause.] And I would like to say that this  truth  might
be bitter, but it is the truth. And we are here to state it  and  defend  it
because we must not try to interpret it; it is  a  fact.  And  if  there  is
anything that is stubborn it is a fact. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 19:45.
