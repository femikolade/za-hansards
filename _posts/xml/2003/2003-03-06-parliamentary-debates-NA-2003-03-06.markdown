                              NOTICES OF MOTION

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE LARGEST MINORITY PARTY:  Madam Speaker, I hereby  give
notice that I intend moving the following motion:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that the Hon T S Yengeni resigned from the National Assembly on
       Wednesday, 5 March 2003; and
  (2) censures Mr Yengeni for his conduct in abusing the protection of  the
       Chair and the Rules with the deliberate intention of  misleading  the
       House.

Ms C DUDLEY: Madam Speaker, I shall move on behalf of the ACDP:


  That the House debates the issue of water  fluoridation  plans  in  South
  Africa, which are going ahead although the Water Research Commission  has
  not completed its research on this issue and serious health concerns have
  been raised.


                         ACHIEVEMENT BY LOCAL HOTELS


                             (Draft Resolution)


Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, I move without notice:


  That the House -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  two South African hotels made the Top 10 in Travel  and  Leisure
           magazine's annual "Very nice values" readers' poll; and


       (b)  the MalaMala Game Reserve reached third place,  while  the  Cape
           Grace Hotel in Cape Town reached fifth place; and


  (2) congratulates these two local hotels on this outstanding  achievement
       and believes that this enhances South Africa's popularity as  one  of
       the favourite tourist destinations in the world.

Agreed to.

                       LEARNER'S UNPAID SCHOOL ACCOUNT

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof S M MAYATULA  (ANC):  Madam  Speaker,  we  note  with  concern  reports
regarding an 18-year old learner, Lunga Komani of  Lungiso  High  School  in
Humansdorp, whose unpaid school account of R50 has been handed over to  debt
collectors. It is further reported that this amount  has  since  accumulated
to R80.

The rights of learners to education is a human right which is  enshrined  in
our Constitution. It is a  right  which  teachers,  parents  and  especially
school governing bodies must uphold.  This  ANC-led  Government  passed  the
South African Schools Act, which  provides,  among  other  things,  that  no
learner should be turned away from school simply because he  or  she  cannot
afford to pay. Furthermore, it makes provision for parents and  learners  to
be exempted from paying school fees in circumstances where they cannot  pay,
more so in Lunga Komani's case since his  mother  has  passed  away  and  he
obviously has to fend for himself.

We therefore call on school governing  bodies  and  everybody  concerned  to
utilise our instruments  created  by  the  ANC  Government  to  ensure  that
inalienable rights of all learners from poor communities are guaranteed  and
that Lunga Komani's are restored. We further call on those parents  who  can
afford  to  meet  their  financial  obligations  to  do  so  diligently  and
unselfishly.

                         MTN MANAGEMENT BUYOUT DEAL
                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N S BRUCE (DP): Madam Speaker, reports of the MTN management buyout  deal
suggest that Government is using pensioners' resources  to  enrich  business
cronies unduly and in breach of good corporate governance. The  public  debt
commissioner has given a R4 billion loan to MTN managers to  buy  Transnet's
18% of the cellphone operator at a premium over market price. This  is  both
unprecedented and unprincipled. As Transnet could not sell this interest  on
the market, Government has shifted the burden  from  its  dubious  transport
undertaking to its pensioners.

Corporate managers are rewarded legitimately if they  add  value  or  assume
risk. The MTN managers have done neither.  They  are  the  beneficiaries  of
preferment at what could be pensioners' undue  expense.  If  the  MTN  share
price rises, they will become  obscenely  rich.  If  the  price  falls,  the
pensioners will carry the can, for the loan won't be repaid.

Nedbank directors who stumbled last year over criticism of  their  purported
extravagance  must,  after  MTN's  preferment,  be  amazed  at   their   own
moderation. I suggest that justice would be served  if  the  newly  enriched
MTN executives were to offer the position of public affairs spokesman to  Mr
Tony Yengeni, who  has  taken  this  House  so  much  into  his  confidence.
[Applause.]

                      TRANSFUSION OF HIV-INFECTED BLOOD

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr U ROOPNARAIN (IFP): Madam Speaker, last year a  13-year  old  boy,  Johan
Stoop, underwent an operation on his leg. In the process he lost  a  lot  of
blood, which warranted him getting a blood transfusion. It has transpired  a
year later that the blood used on him was  HIV-positive  and  he  has  since
been infected with HIV.

This is not good news coming  from  two  health  facilities,  the  SA  Blood
Transfusion Services and Pretoria Academic Hospital. They  are  supposed  to
have exhaustive measures to  ensure  hygienic  transfusions.  We  hope  that
there is going to be prompt action to ensure  that  this  state  of  affairs
does not reoccur.

     APPEAL TO COMMUNITY TO ACQUIRE ID DOCUMENTS AND BIRTH CERTIFICATES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr W M SKHOSANA (ANC): Madam Speaker, in the past year, the  President  made
a call to all South Africans to join hands  in  efforts  to  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty. Each section and department in the Government  has  to
develop a plan that will contribute to the  nation's  effort.  Pensions  for
senior citizens and people with disabilities  in  our  country,  and  social
grants for children under eight years  of  age,  for  now,  are  among  such
efforts to fight poverty among our people. Many of our people are still  not
able to access what  is  rightfully  theirs  because  of  several  problems.
Primary among those problems is the issue of identity documents  for  senior
citizens and people with disabilities, and birth certificates for children.

The central department which addresses this problem  is  the  Department  of
Home Affairs. I call on all people in the Moses Kotane  municipality  to  go
to Home Affairs offices to seek assistance on the matter.

The centrality of the Department of Home Affairs cannot  be  overemphasised.
As members of this House we need to  mobilise  our  people  to  go  and  get
identity documents and birth certificates. The staff in  the  Department  of
Home Affairs needs to be alerted to this fact. We are making a special  call
to the members of staff of the Department of Home Affairs to  go  the  extra
mile in an effort to push back the frontiers  of  poverty.  Let  our  people
access what is rightfully theirs. [Applause.]

           CALL TO METRORAIL TO IMPROVE PASSENGER SAFETY IN TRAINS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C R REDCLIFFE (New NP):  Madam  Speaker,  the  New  NP  is  shocked  that
another train passenger, Mr  David  Dunston,  was  brutally  attacked  in  a
Metrorail train on Tuesday. This comes after the Cape High  Court  ruled  in
February that Metrorail and the Minister of Transport must ensure  passenger
safety on trains as it is their legal duty to protect  the  lives  of  train
commuters and that the onus is not on the police to protect passengers.

The New NP finds it unacceptable that Metrorail  have  indicated  that  they
want to appeal against the court order. There is  no  question  about  their
responsibility to ensure the safety of  commuters.  If  Metrorail  does  not
take the necessary steps to improve train safety, they could be  faced  with
thousands of civil cases against them at an astronomical cost. The  New  NP,
however, welcomes the announcement by the national  deputy  commissioner  of
the police, Mr Andre Pruis, that the police will implement the provision  of
21 mobile units to help ensure the safety of train passengers.  This  should
be done as a matter of urgency.

Co-operation between Metrorail and the police can ensure that South  African
trains are once again a safe and popular  mode  of  transport.  The  New  NP
calls on Metrorail to comply with the  court  order  and  to  improve  train
safety because, for thousands of people, this is the  only  available  means
of transport and they have a right to commute in safety. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: Hon members, there is far too much noise in the House  and  far
too many meetings are taking place.

                        CENTRALISED PENSION PAYPOINTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Prof L M MBADI (UDM): Madam Speaker, the social grant beneficiaries  in  the
Eastern Cape have been experiencing mammoth problems since  the  outsourcing
of pension payments to CPS and AllPay.  They  claim  they  were  better  off
under the departmental officials. Those that have  bank  arrangements  would
rather remain  with  the  banks.  These  service  providers  do  not  inform
beneficiaries timeously with regard to the dates  and  venues.  Consequently
beneficiaries flock to one point,  with  disastrous  emotional  consequences
when they are turned away.

In most cases service providers do not have accurate  numbers  per  paypoint
and bring insufficient funds, to the disappointment of  many  beneficiaries.
The  tendency   to   centralise   paypoints   brings   hardships   to   many
beneficiaries, especially elderly women and the disabled, who have  to  walk
long distances. These walks sometimes are through small forests  or  bushes.
On their return they face the risk of being robbed.

Centralisation results in long queues, exacerbated  by  the  nonavailability
of facilities and resources such as  help  desks,  pay  halls,  toilets  and
water.

                         CAPE TOWN UNICITY OFFICIALS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr B M SOLO (ANC): Madam Speaker, let me take this  opportunity  to  welcome
the decision of the Cape Town Unicity Council to appoint the  first  African
city manager, Mr Wallace Mgoqi. I  further  congratulate  Mr  Mgoqi  on  his
appointment to this position. I firmly believe  that  he  will  utilise  his
skills and experience and serve the people of Cape  Town  with  distinction.
Mr Mgoqi and the Unicity of Cape Town have started  on  the  right  foot  in
turning the tide by cutting his salary and freeing resources to be used  for
development, unlike the DA appointee, a certain Mr Maydon, who  earned  R1,4
million. Mr Mgoqi took a salary cut which gives him less than half  of  this
amount and reflects his commitment to  the  principles  of  Batho  Pele,  to
serve the people and contribute in the struggle to push back  the  frontiers
of poverty. [Applause.]

During its short-lived tenure, the DA abused council resources  to  a  point
where the ANC-New NP alliance partnership now has  the  serious  problem  of
tackling the challenge of ensuring the city's financial sustainability.  The
mayor of Cape Town further demonstrated her commitment to  fighting  poverty
together with the people of Cape Town  by  ensuring  through  her  listening
campaign that every citizen of Cape Town contributes to how the  budget  and
the IDP process of Cape Town should be run. We call upon all  city  managers
and mayors to learn from this: Put the people first  by  ensuring  effective
service  delivery  and   development,   particularly   in   the   previously
disadvantaged communities. I thank you. [Applause.]

                           NEED FOR MORAL COURAGE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr L M GREEN (ACDP): Madam Speaker, in 1994 our nation  elected  to  have  a
democratic society. As in cricket, we very soon became major league  players
on the international scene. Currently we are seeking to play umpire  in  the
USA-Iraq issue. Yet, like every team, we have our Achilles'  heel,  in  that
we disregard the weaker players at our own  peril.  Such  is  our  situation
with regard to Zimbabwe.

The rule of  law  and  the  rights  of  democracy  are  rapidly  eroding  in
Zimbabwe. [Interjections.] Yet we have become spectators on  the  sidelines,
blindfolded as the demise of our neighbour state takes place before us

In South Africa we are also facing great obstacles - such issues  as  crime,
corruption, bad service delivery, lethargy and complacency towards  a  moral
commitment to lead our nation out of  the  grip  of  social  despair.  South
Africans locally and around the world desire a leadership that will put  our
domestic concerns in order. The ground rules have been  established  and  we
need to deliver.

It is time for us to show moral courage and to demonstrate  that  we  are  a
nation with a future under the divine leadership  of  God.  We  are  blessed
with a people who show keen ability to build a  nation  skilled  in  various
types of expertise. All  that  is  required  is  a  domestic  vision  and  a
leadership presence to unleash this potential and fight social ills such  as
poverty, unemployment and criminal activities.
Let us not, like our national cricket team, wait for the rain  to  determine
our future. We have all the right conditions to achieve our  goals,  but  we
need to focus and build on our strengths, primarily from  a  domestic  point
of view. Instead of creating the right conditions ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Time expired.]

                        MINIMUM WAGES FOR FARMWORKERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr C AUCAMP (AEB): Madam Speaker, in his very  first  state  of  the  nation
address in 1999, President Thabo Mbeki made mention  of  certain  unforeseen
consequences of the labour laws that needed attention. One does not need  to
be a prophet to foresee that the new law on minimum  wages  for  farmworkers
that comes into operation at the end of  this  month  will  definitely  have
devastating unforeseen consequences, not only for the farming industry,  but
also for farmworkers.  [Interjections.]  Let  me  state  it  clearly,  Madam
Speaker: The AEB is in favour of a minimum wage for any worker  anywhere  in
South Africa.

Die Bybel sê immers, die arbeider is sy loon werd. Dit is  egter  die  ``one
size fits all''-benadering van die nuwe wet wat  nie  ruimte  maak  vir  die
talle onmisbare determinante in die  landboubedryf  nie,  wat  hersien  moet
word. Die gebrek aan die voorsiening vir meriete, vir  geskooldheid  en  vir
posverantwoordelikheid  ondermyn  produktiwiteit  en   ondernemingsgees   by
werkers. Die slegs 10%-aftrekking vir behuising en vir  rantsoene  gaan  die
standaard daarvan laat daal tot nadeel van die werkers.

Navorsing deur die Sagtevrugte Produsente Trust  toon  dat  die  minimumloon
van R800 per maand byna 60% arbeidsverlies gaan beteken. Dit  sal  nie  wees
as gevolg van  afdankings  nie,  maar  weens  bankrotskappe  en  strukturele
veranderinge. So kan ek  voortgaan.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Indeed, the Bible says that the labourer is worthy of  his  hire.  However,
it is the ``one size fits all'' approach of the legislation, which does  not
leave room for the numerous indispensable determinants in  the  agricultural
industry, that should be reviewed. The lack  of  provision  for  merit,  for
skill and for  post  responsibility  is  undermining  productivity  and  the
spirit of enterprise among workers. The mere 10% deduction for  housing  and
for rations will cause the standard of these to drop  to  the  detriment  of
the workers.

Research by the Deciduous Fruit Producers'  Trust  shows  that  the  minimum
wage of R800 per month will mean a loss of labour of almost 60%.  This  will
not be as a result of dismissals, but owing to bankruptcies  and  structural
changes. I could continue in this fashion.]

The AEB calls on the Minister to place a moratorium on the  commencement  of
the Act, in order to make certain necessary amendments; otherwise  you  will
have to apply damage control again  in  two  years'  time,  because  of  the
clearly unforeseen consequences. I thank you.

                           ATTACK ON CHIEF JUSTICE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs S V KALYAN (DP): Madam Speaker, the  ANC's  support  for  the  unsavoury
actions of Zimbabwe's  government  continues.  ANC  MPL  Dumisani  Makhaye's
attack on South Africa's Chief Justice Chaskalson and eight  other  Southern
African judges for expressing their concern  at  the  arrest  of  Zimbabwean
judges is ill-considered and dangerous. He accused  the  Chief  Justice  and
other  judges  of  hiding  behind  their  independence   and   instinctively
defending elements of the Zimbabwean judiciary who thought they  were  above
the law.

The judges pointed out that  the  usual  procedure  when  judges,  including
those in Zimbabwe, face criminal charges is to hold an independent  inquiry,
followed by impeachment if the allegations are found to  be  true.  Instead,
Zimbabwean judges are being arrested and tried while they are still  sitting
judges. This amounts to intimidation by the state.  Mr  Makaya  approves  of
that. His former department  in  KwaZulu-Natal  is  being  investigated  for
corruption. Is this why he casts aspersions on  our  judges?  The  ANC  must
repudiate this dangerous man. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: I apologise. I omitted the ANC. ANC, it is your turn to make  a
member's statement.

               DAMAGE CAUSED BY RAIN, WHIRLWINDS AND TORNADOES

                            (Member's Statement)

Nksz  N  MAHLAWE  (ANC):  Somlomo,   kwezi   ntsuku   zimbalwa   zidlulileyo
izitshingitshane  zemvula   nenkanyamba   zitshabalalise   izindlu,   imfuyo
nezikolo kwinqila yaseOliver Tambo neChris Hani, kunye nesithili  sase  King
Sabatha Dalindyebo. Iingxelo ezingaqinisekiswanga zithi kuye kwakho  umhlali
othe waphulukana nomphefumlo wakhe.

Uluntu ngokubanzi alukwazi ukuyilawula imo yezulu  enje,  kodwa  ezenkcubeko
nenzululwazi  kunye  nolwazi  lwemveli  luyakwazi  ukuqikelela  imo  yezulu.
Kubalulekile ke into  yokuba  ingqikelelo  yemo  yezulu  ikwazi  ukufikelela
nasezilalini ukwenzela into yokuba abantu  bakwazi  ukuzilungiselela  iimeko
ezilolu hlobo.

Sithabatha  eli  thuba  ke  sivakalisa  uvelwano  kwabo  bathe  balahlekelwa
zizindlu  nempahla  zabo,  sinethemba   lokuba   uRhulumente   wabantu   uya
kuthabatha amanyathela okuncedisana nabo bathe bafumana eli lishwa,  bakwazi
ukuba baqhubekeke nobomi babo.

Sihlaba ikhwelo kuluntu ngokubanzi ukuba  lufake  isandla  ekuncediseni  abo
bathe  bangxwelereka  sesi  simo  sezulu   ke   a   leboga.   [Kwaqhwatywa.]
(Translation of Xhosa member's statement follows.)
[Ms N MAHLAWE (ANC): Madam Speaker, in the  past  few  days  whirlwinds  and
tornadoes have destroyed houses, livestock and schools in the  Oliver  Tambo
and Chris  Hani  district  municipalities,  as  well  as  the  King  Sabatha
Dalindyebo area. Unconfirmed reports indicate that one resident lost his  or
her life.

The public at large cannot control this kind of  weather,  but  culture  and
science and traditional knowledge can be used to  forecast  weather.  It  is
therefore important that weather forecasts should reach the rural  areas  so
that people there can make the necessary arrangements.

We therefore take this opportunity to express  our  sympathy  to  those  who
lost houses and property, and hope that the Government of  the  people  will
take steps to help those who suffered this  misfortune,  so  that  they  can
carry on with their lives.

We appeal to the wider public to lend a helping hand to those  who  suffered
injuries as a result of these weather conditions. I thank you. [Applause.]

                          LOSS OF SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS
                            (Member's Statement)

Prince N E ZULU (IFP): Thank you,  Madam  Speaker.  My  statement  is  about
losses of school  textbooks.  The  Government  commission's  report  on  the
financing, resourcing and cost of education in public schools  has  revealed
that R300 million worth of textbooks are lost every year. This,  the  report
says, is due to the nonreturn of textbooks by pupils.

It has also been reported that this monetary loss is equivalent to  100  new
primary schools that could be built annually. This is an alarming  state  of
affairs, and pupils at Samora Machel Primary  School  in  Philippi  in  Cape
Town, with an enrolment of 750, are taught under trees. We hope  that  there
will be measures introduced to overturn this sad situation.  We  acknowledge
that the department and the  Government  are  committed  to  bringing  about
revolutionary reform in education and  this  situation  is  foiling  such  a
noble cause. I thank you, Ma'am.

                         RETALIATION BY RAPE VICTIM

                            (Member's Statement)
Mr M S BOOI (ANC): Madam Speaker, it is alleged that Mzimkulu  Mngalane  was
stabbed to death by a female, Lulama  Gxelishe,  on  1  March  2003  at  the
Orange Grove squatter camp in East London. This was in  retaliation  for  an
incident involving the gang rape of the accused, and the deceased  had  been
identified by the accused as one of the gang members that raped her.

The sexual abuse of women and rape are gross violations of the human  rights
of women. These are barbaric and cowardly acts that  must  be  condemned  by
all citizens. Where these incidents occur, communities must  work  with  the
police to ensure that this barbaric practice and behaviour is uprooted.

We are equally disturbed about incidents where citizens take  the  law  into
their own hands. It is incorrect for a citizen, no  matter  how  gruesome  a
criminal act might have been,  to  act  in  retaliation  towards  those  who
perpetrated criminal acts that infringe on his or  her  rights.  Communities
and individuals must always report a criminal offence to the police so  that
the law can take its course.

We have to be mindful that both victims and perpetrators  have  rights,  and
that everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty by a  court  of  law.
We therefore condemn actions where individuals take the law into  their  own
hands, as this amounts to abuse of human rights and undermines the  criminal
justice system. [Applause.]

                             BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr S J GOUS (Nuwe NP): Mevrou die Speaker,  dit  is  miskien  nodig  om  die
veelbesproke  geval  waar  'n  seun   MIV-positief   getoets   het   na   'n
bloedoortapping in  perspektief  te  stel.  Dit  is  tans  'n  wetenskaplike
werklikheid dat daar altyd 'n statistiese kans bestaan  om  MIV/Vigs  op  te
doen  deur  middel  van  'n  bloedoortapping,  ten  spyte  van   die   beste
toetsingmetodes.

Die  probleem  ontstaan  as  gevolg  van   die   sogenaamde   vensterperiode
waartydens bloed nie positief sal toets ten spyte daarvan dat dit besmet  is
nie. Die  wetenskap  en  tegnologie  het  hierdie  vensterperiode  reeds  na
omtrent twee weke verminder, en in  die  toekoms  sal  dit  waarskynlik  nog
verder verminder. Maar totdat die vensterperiode  totaal  uitgeskakel  word,
sal die oordrag van MIV in die  bloedprodukte  altyd  'n  moontlikheid  bly.
Hierdie   feite   reflekteer   geensins   op    die    optrede    van    die
bloedoortappingsdiens nie, maar vir die persoon met wie dit gebeur, bly  dit
'n harde werklikheid.

Die Nuwe NP spreek sy meegevoel uit met mense  wat  MIV  op  hierdie  manier
opdoen. Dit is  juis  as  gevolg  van  bogenoemde  probleme  dat  bloed  van
hoërisiko persone nie gebruik behoort te  word  nie.  Die  moontlikhede  van
auto-oortapping en skenking en oortapping  binne  familieverband  moet  meer
benut word. Byvoorbeeld, as 'n persoon weet hy moet  'n  operasie  ondergaan
waartydens hy bloed gaan benodig, kan hy dit oorweeg om vooraf sy eie  bloed
te skenk, of om bloed van sy familie te ontvang.

Bloedoortappings red duisende lewens, en  sal  dit  steeds  in  die  toekoms
doen. Dankie. (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Dr S J GOUS (New NP): Madam Speaker, it is perhaps necessary  to  put  into
perspective the much-discussed case  in  which  a  boy  tested  HIV-positive
after a blood transfusion. It is  currently  a  scientific  reality  that  a
statistical chance always exists of contracting HIV/Aids by way of  a  blood
transfusion, despite the best testing methods.

The problem arises as a result of the so-called window period  during  which
blood will  not  test  positive  despite  being  contaminated.  Science  and
technology have already reduced this  window  period  to  approximately  two
weeks, and in future it will probably be reduced  even  further.  But  until
the window period is completely eliminated the  transfer  of  HIV  in  blood
products will remain a possibility. These facts in no  way  reflect  on  the
activities of the blood transfusion service, but  for  the  person  to  whom
this happens it remains a hard reality.

The New NP expresses its sympathy with people who  have  contracted  HIV  in
this way. It is precisely as a result of the  aforementioned  problems  that
blood from high-risk persons should not be used. The possibilities of  auto-
transfusion and donation and transfusion within families should be  utilised
more extensively. For example, if someone knows that he has  to  undergo  on
operation during which he will need blood, he can consider donating his  own
blood ahead of time, or receiving blood from his family.

Blood transfusions save thousands of lives, and will continue to  do  so  in
the future. Thank you.]

                       LEARNER'S UNPAID SCHOOL ACCOUNT

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF  EDUCATION:  Madam  Speaker,  I  reply  to  Prof  Mayatula's
intervention with a strong feeling of absolute despair.  There  you  have  a
situation of a young boy who has to fend for himself, who lives by  himself,
and is treated in this extraordinary way by a  school  and  governing  body,
and if I may say so, by the debt collector.

The reason why I intervene is that it is vital that Parliament supports  the
enforcement of the law for the most  vulnerable  of  our  people.  The  most
vulnerable are those at school. It is illegal  to  send  this  to  the  debt
collector. It is illegal for a former Model  C  school  in  Pretoria,  as  I
learnt today from a fellow member  of  Parliament,  to  charge  R1 000 as  a
condition for admission. It is illegal for a school, as I  read  in  a  long
report from the North West province, to withhold reports. It is  illegal  to
deny admission to teaching and learning activities for nonpayment.

Where parents are able to pay, the sins of the parents can never be  visited
on the children. I think this is said in a well-known book  that  people  in
South Africa take reasonably seriously, and the  sins  of  the  parents  are
being visited here. But where there is an orphan, or where the  parents  are
very poor, it is an  offence  not  to  allow  for  the  exemption  that  the
children are entitled to by law. Therefore, in our report on the  costs  and
the financing of education, released on Monday, we take very  seriously  how
to deal with the situation in this group of 20%, or  possibly  40%,  of  our
children who attend schools.

This issue also affects middle-class parents. I  get  letters  from  middle-
class parents whose children are being victimised, and  there  is  no  other
word. So can I conclude by saying: I shall investigate the matter.  I  shall
refer it to the Eastern Cape education department,  and  I  think  that  the
most condign punishment should be meted out to those involved in this  -  as
we all know, ignorance of the law is no excuse  -  including  the  principal
and the governing body, if they are  involved,  and  debt  collectors  also,
because debt collectors are part of a conspiracy to deny the children  their
right. This is why I think intervention is necessary.

                          LOSS OF SCHOOL TEXTBOOKS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF EDUCATION: The  second  issue  is  the  question  of  school
texts, and again I intervene, because this is  of  enormous  importance.  We
are one of the few countries in the world that  supply  free  school  texts,
and, of course, in principle the schools are  supposed  to  supply  them  to
pupils at the beginning of  the  year.  Of  course  we  have  two  kinds  of
schools: We have section 21 schools, where  in  fact  the  total  charge  of
their budget, the lump sum, is given by the province.  They,  in  fact,  are
also guilty of not supplying books. I do not know what they  use  the  money
for, but in the provinces of  Gauteng  and  the  Western  Cape,  section  21
schools are not all coming  up  to  par  in  the  supply  of  books  to  the
children.

For the rest of the  provinces,  the  province  supplies  the  books.  Books
should be returned, for it is  as  the  hon  member  has  said:  The  amount
involved can help to build a hundred schools in a decade. So we  lose  about
R300 million out of a total budget, for  school  textbooks  only,  of  about
R700 million every year. Therefore we are part of a mobilisation,  and  this
House should be too, because this is public money,  at  the  very  important
point of delivery, and we're part of a mobilisation to  ensure  that  school
books are returned at the end of the year. But I do not  think  we  can  use
the withholding of results as a  punishment  for  the  nonreturn  of  books.
Thank you very much for raising this matter in the House.

I am afraid I do not have the details of our children learning under  trees.
Remember, schools have to be registered. There are many informal school set-
ups for reasons which are not clear to us always. Unless they  register  and
register their children, these are informal schools, and  the  province  has
no responsibility for the payment of the teachers, maintenance of  standards
and a supply of books.

I look forward to  the  hon  member  supplying  me  with  information  about
children under trees - and that in the Western Cape, ``nogal''!  Thank  you.

                        CENTRALISED PENSION PAYPOINTS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, I  would  like  to  thank
the hon Mbadi for raising the issue of the distribution of pensions  in  the
Eastern Cape to the weakest members of our society. Quite obviously I  think
that there is  something  radically  wrong  there  in  the  distribution  of
pensions. But that issue, at the present moment, is  being  looked  into  by
the task team that is working there from my department,  the  Department  of
Public Service  and  Administration,  and  the  Departments  of  Health  and
Education. They are dealing with the problem that the people of the  Eastern
Cape face. But at the same time I would like to correct the  hon  Mr  Mbadi,
who thinks that the cause of that is centralisation, as he has put it.

It is not centralisation that is the problem, but it is  the  privatisation,
generally, of the distribution of pensions there, because, as  the  majority
of this House has always been crying, a private company has been  given  the
task of distributing pensions. The main thing was that we hoped that  by  so
doing  we  would  be  improving  the  conditions.  But,  unfortunately,  all
companies that are doing that, that is CPS and AllPay, are really not up  to
standard. There are a lot of things that are wrong there which ought  to  be
corrected. [Interjections.]

Unfortunately, the same people that are supposed to  be  helped  are  really
finding it very difficult. That proves  beyond  any  reasonable  doubt  that
some of the things that the DP has always  been  crying  for,  for  instance
that privatisation is the answer to  everything,  are  not  necessarily  the
issue. [Interjections.] I think I would thank the hon member ...

The SPEAKER: Order!

The MINISTER OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT: Madam Speaker, can you protect me?

The SPEAKER: Order! But you are running over time, so would you  bring  your
intervention to an end, please? Order, hon  members!  Are  there  any  other
Ministers that wish to intervene?

      THE ATTAINMENT OF PEACE AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE IN AFRICA IS A
  PREREQUISITE FOR THE REALISATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND GENDER EQUALITY FOR
                                HER CITIZENS

                          (Subject for Discussion)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Speaker, members of the National Assembly, it has  been  said  that  if  one
empowers a country's women, one empowers the whole nation.  This  must  also
be true for the  continent  of  Africa.  If  one  empowers  her  women,  one
empowers Africa. In South Africa  the  promotion  and  protection  of  human
rights has, since 1994, become integral  to  the  long-term  development  of
this  country.  Recognising  that   women's   rights   are   human   rights,
mainstreaming gender,  has  been  central  to  the  sustainable  development
programmes that Government has set in place for  a  new  and  inclusive  way
forward.

We are all becoming increasingly aware  that  the  development  of  Africa's
women is essential for the successful and  sustainable  development  of  our
continent. Quite recently UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,  when  addressing
African leaders, observed:


  If you want to save the African continent,  you  must  save  the  African
  woman first.

We have, since 1994, set in  place  many  pieces  of  legislation  that  are
designed  to  empower  South  African  women.  One  must,  though,  see  the
development  of  this  legislation  within  the  context  of   the   overall
development process. The development of legal frameworks  that  support  the
empowerment of women must be seen within the context  of  a  housing  policy
that  targets  the  poorest  and  the  most  vulnerable;   within   a   land
redistribution programme that addresses rural  and  gender  marginalisation;
within an education policy that insists upon equal access to  education  for
all girl children; and within an economic  framework  that  facilitates  the
access of women to resources that enable economic participation.

Since 1994,  when  South  Africa  gained  its  status  as  a  constitutional
democracy and  international  citizen  of  good  standing,  the  legislative
review process has resulted in the production of an  unprecedented  body  of
laws that lay the foundation for the transformation of  our  society.  Based
on the vision of a nonsexist, nonracist  democracy,  our  political  leaders
have made a conscious effort to put  in  place  gender-specific  legislative
frameworks to support the advancement of  women's  rights.  Our  experience,
however, is that laws on their own cannot and do not change  the  status  of
vulnerable groups nor do they automatically alter the  conditions  of  those
that require special protections against poverty and discrimination.  It  is
the implementation of these  laws  and  the  developmental  frameworks  that
support them that will  secure  a  better  life  for  our  people.  We  have
therefore to narrow the  gap  between  ambitious  legislative  measures  and
practical delivery on the ground.

Our Constitution exhorts us to free the potential in all  our  citizens.  To
do so we must place at their very fingertips those resources that have  been
earmarked to fight the scourge of poverty and ameliorate its impact  on  the
quality of life. Increasing the number of interfaces between  the  community
and Government service centres is essential, but this infrastructural  drive
must be supported by improved service delivery in the spirit of  Batho  Pele
- government's credo for a quality, people-centred public service.

Our President, in his state of the nation address last month,  had  this  to
say on service delivery:


  The effective delivery of the expanded services to  the  people  requires
  that we  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  Public  Service.  Without  an
  efficient and an effective public service, it will be impossible  for  us
  to register the advances of which we are capable.

Balancing the dire need to develop people and especially women  against  the
backdrop of financial and other resource constraints has become the  lot  of
developing countries. We have, however, come to  recognise  that  the  acute
development  challenges  we  face  in  this  country  have  strong  regional
imperatives.  We  have  therefore  engaged  our  African  partners  and  the
international community to develop an overall strategy that interlocks  with
the development needs of our region.

The New Partnership for African Development provides the  architecture  that
will sustain and support a proactive, progressive and holistic  approach  to
the development of Africa and her people. Fortunately, there  is  a  growing
global acceptance that in order to remain relevant,  development  programmes
must be rights based. Furthermore, these programmes should be  informed  and
motivated by the need to realise  the  whole  gamut  of  rights  that  makes
sustainability  achievable  and  contextually  relevant.  We  must   satisfy
ourselves when implementing development programmes, but, over and above  the
obvious political rights that must be addressed,  social,  economic,  gender
and environmental rights should also be mainstreamed  into  the  development
agenda.

Policies to address the increasing ... [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Why don't your ... [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Have  your
eyes been closed? Certainly your ears have. [Laughter.]

Policies to address the increasing feminisation of poverty on our  continent
and programmes to reverse the chronic effects for African women of years  of
underdevelopment  must  be  set  in  place.  The  acid  test   for   Nepad's
development programmes would be the  degree  to  which  the  rights  of  the
poorest and the most vulnerable - Africa's women -  are  realised  in  their
application.

President  Thabo  Mbeki  has  emphasised  that  good  governance   and   the
elimination  of  conflict  are  two  key  ingredients  for  the   successful
implemention of  Nepad.  In  this  regard  we  as  Africans  should  not  be
satisfied merely with the absence of war. We must insist upon  the  complete
eradication of violence, particularly violence directed at  our  continent's
women and children.

To eliminate poverty we must develop a global community in such a  way  that
the  potential  in  each  person,  each  community,  each  institution   and
therefore each country, is optimised. Developing people is about  developing
their capacity to engage opportunity. It is about developing their  capacity
as individuals and communities to become proactive agents  of  change.  This
approach to development recognises the desire of developing countries to  be
active  participants  in  the  development  process  rather   than   passive
recipients of prestructured aid packages.  This  approach  also  presupposes
the  need  for  innovative  partnerships  in  which  the  strengths  of  the
collaborating parties  are  optimised  and  the  weaknesses  are  eliminated
through mutual co-operation and unity of purpose.  And  from  this  approach
will flow a pattern of achievement and progress that  constantly  reinforces
the collective good.

In just under a decade  the  transition  from  apartheid  to  democracy  has
delivered real advances in gender equity,  but  much  remains  to  be  done.
Gender inequities persist in  the  daily  lives  of  our  women,  especially
African women. Both research and anecdotal  evidence  suggest  that  gender-
based discrimination here and in the rest  of  Africa  is  still  cause  for
serious concern. We are all of us starkly aware how race, class  and  gender
conspire  to  relegate  women  to  the  very  bottom  of  the  human  rights
hierarchy. We must, all of us, continue  to  accelerate  the  drive  towards
gender equity and gender rights realisation. Our President, Mr Thabo  Mbeki,
has insisted on rights realisation for  women  as  a  primary  indicator  of
developmental progress. In fact, our President considers the empowerment  of
women to be ``the litmus test'' of rights development in our country.

The emancipation of African women from discrimination is a  precondition  of
Africa's liberation. For women  in  South  Africa,  the  journey  towards  a
society free of discrimination and  deprivation  has  started  and  is  well
under way. We have been inspired by such luminaries as Lilian  Ngoyi,  Helen
Joseph and Parliament's  own  Getrude  Shope,  and  we  are  girded  by  the
knowledge that there exists  the  necessary  political  will  to  achieve  a
society free of racism, sexism and patriarchy.

As Government prepares to legislate  on  black  economic  empowerment  later
this year, we must, as women, participate in the discussions,  lobbying  and
decisions that will formulate the nature of this legislation. We must do  so
because  we  believe  that  black   economic   empowerment,   like   women's
empowerment, is a constitutional imperative. We must do so because it  makes
good business sense. We must do so because we know that  by  empowering  the
disempowered we strengthen ourselves, our economy and our  country.  And  we
must  do  so  because  we  believe  that  our  interventions  will  make   a
difference.

Before I conclude, I  would  like  to  quote  from  an  article  by  Michael
McCarthy, a journalist for the Independent, who wrote:


  The argument for empowering women in developing  countries,  and  in  the
  development process, stems not just from equity, but  from  practicality.
  It is not only right and just that women should be given  a  voice,  have
  the  work  they  do  recognised,  and  be  treated  with  respect  -  the
  consequences of leaving them behind are dire for whole societies.

Madam Speaker, you might  be  aware  that  Mrs  Zanele  Mbeki  is  currently
convening a process that aims to promote peace in our  region.  Sixty  women
from the DRC arrived in South Africa on Monday to participate  in  the  DRC-
South Africa women's dialogue towards regional peace. During  the  three-day
conference that  is  currently  under  way  in  Pretoria,  women  from  both
countries and from all walks of life will, amongst  other  things,  exchange
strategies  on  women's  integration  within  their  own   political   party
formations and share experiences on  how  South  Africa  achieved  a  common
women's agenda during  the  democratisation  process  leading  to  the  1994
elections. They will also try to get an understanding of how women can  play
a role in the decision-making processes that lead government  decisions  and
public  decisions  as  they  relate  to  NGOs,   CPOs   and   other   public
institutions.
This initiative follows on South Africa's support of the DRC  peace  process
in Sun City and Pretoria last year. It is also  a  shining  example  of  how
women can participate in and influence the  important  developmental  issues
that continually challenge our continent. I am sure that you  will  join  me
in  wishing  both  delegations  well   during   this   conference   and   in
congratulating Mrs Mbeki on leading this important  process.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Ms  J  A  SEMPLE:  Madam  Speaker,  the  Democratic  Alliance  supports  the
objectives of the African Charter in its efforts to ensure that every  woman
shall be entitled to the enjoyment of the  rights  and  freedoms  recognised
and guaranteed in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights  and  the
present protocol, without  distinction  of  any  kind.  It  is  clearly  not
possible to achieve these rights in countries such as Zimbabwe, where  peace
and democracy are not present.

The draft protocol to the African Charter  on  human  rights  calls  on  all
member states to eliminate every discrimination against women and to  ensure
the protection of  the  rights  of  women  as  stipulated  in  international
declarations  and  conventions.  This  includes   eliminating   gender-based
violence against women, which has been internationally recognised as a  form
of sex discrimination.

The  African  Charter  specifically  repudiates  the  inequality  of   sexes
wherever it exists, rejecting all notions and  institutions  of  superiority
and inferiority on the basis of sex and affirming the equal humanity of  men
and women. One of the worst forms of asserting  superiority  -  and,  it  is
said, a way of minimising feelings of inferiority,  especially  where  there
is high unemployment and women ``no longer know their  place''  -  is  rape,
and this will be dealt with in greater detail later by my colleague the  hon
Waters.

It is further noted that discrimination against women is an obstacle to  the
participation of women in the political, social, economic and cultural  life
of their countries and constitutes  an  obstacle  to  development  in  those
countries. It has been proved that  educating  women  provides  for  greater
socioeconomic upliftment: children are better  educated  and  nourished  and
the family has a higher standard of living.

Discrimination by women against women further undermines their  status.  The
members of the JMC  (Joint  Monitoring  Committee)  on  the  Improvement  of
Quality of Life and Status of Women were not briefed by the  Office  on  the
Status of Women before they left to  present  South  Africa's  case  to  the
Commission on the Status of Women in New York this week.  The  excuse  given
was that the presenter was too tired to  drive  to  the  airport.  When  the
report was finally faxed through, it was found to be of very  poor  quality.
One wonders what mandate  such  a  report  carried  when  it  was  not  even
discussed with the very people who represent the women  of  our  country  in
this Parliament.

It is crucial that if women want  to  be  taken  seriously  and  take  their
rightful place alongside men as equals, they must at  least  stand  together
and support each other. Thank you. [Applause.]

Dr U ROOPNARAIN: Madam Speaker, hon members, each segment of the  subject  -
human rights, peace, gender, Africa and democracy - could easily take  up  a
whole week of discussions on its own. I will give a broad overview  from  my
own perspective, and let  me  immediately  recognise  that  all  issues  are
interrelated. We, as South Africans, with our position and purpose, have  an
enormous responsibility towards Africa. We  are  really  like  an  umbilical
cord. We know that all societies bear the imprints and birthmarks  of  their
own past; Africa is no different, and Africa has walked a savage road.

My speech is tempered towards a human rights approach. I believe it is  time
to get away from that hardy old chestnut of Afro-pessimism, which says  that
Africa is inferior, Africa is backward, Africa is unproductive and  corrupt.
Too often have we seen pictures of an  emaciated  child  depending  on  some
merciful charity. It was Africa's great leader who once said:


  Of all the sins Africa can commit, the sin of despair would be  the  most
  unforgivable.

Africa needs to assert her humanity and not become a beast of burden.  I  am
reminded of President Mbeki's words from  his  book  Africa:  The  Time  Has
Come, but I would like to say: Africa, the time is now!

Although I speak of the relationship between Africa and us, I am not  saying
that experiences can be transposed from one  country  to  another.  So  what
next, you may ask? An important issue is the issue of human  rights.  It  is
about  recovery  and  reclaiming  the  dignity  of  the  people  of  Africa,
especially the women who have been raped, women  who  have  been  physically
and emotionally abused, women who  have  been  maimed  by  conflicts,  wars,
genocide, and women who have  become  refugees,  displaced,  and  have  lost
their human worth and dignity.

Human rights are too important to be a symbolic gesture or just a mantra  to
chant on Human Rights Day or on International Women's Day.  Where  there  is
conflict, there is no democracy.  Over  the  past  few  decades  Africa  has
probably suffered  more  from  armed  conflict  than  any  other  continent.
Between 1960 and 1998, there were 32 wars in  Africa,  seven  million  lives
were lost and over  nine  million  people  became  refugees,  returnees  and
displaced, not to mention the untold trauma, loss and suffering. Today  many
are still fighting this war.

The repercussions of these  conflicts  have  seriously  undermined  Africa's
efforts to ensure long-term prosperity, stability, democracy,  human  rights
and gender equality. Instead they have brought  on  extreme  poverty,  human
rights atrocities and starvation. I think it  was  a  Nobel  laureate,  Egil
Aarvik, who said:


  There are people who are  not  satisfied  merely  to  draw  attention  to
  alarming trends, but who also devote their energy and ability to  turning
  the tide.

We need to move  away  from  spurious  self-interest  and  help  unlock  the
forbidden opportunities in women. The most insidious  barrier  to  women  is
the lack of participation in decision-making structures. The IFP is  of  the
opinion that the world needs a new social contract,  a  contract  that  puts
women on an equal footing at all levels, from  the  private  sphere  to  the
public sphere. We as the IFP believe that peace education is  paramount  and
crucial.

Finally, it should be immoral and illegal  for  any  government  to  have  a
military budget that is greater than its health and  education  budget.  Let
us refuel the torch and help turn the tide. The  time  for  Africa  is  now.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mev ANNA VAN WYK: Mevrou die Speaker, die bywoning  van  'n  byeenkoms  soos
die Rassemblement des Femmes pour la Paix - die Vergadering,  of  byeenkoms,
van Vroue  vir  Vrede  -  waarna  die  agb  Gillwald  verwys  het,  van  die
Demokratiese  Republiek  van  die   Kongo   en   Suid-Afrika,   is   werklik
insiggewend. Die byeenkoms vind plaas onder  die  Afrika-Unie  en  Nepad  se
sambreel. Die doelwitte is onder  meer,  soos  sy  gesê  het,  om  onderling
strategieë uit te ruil van Suid-Afrikaanse vroue  se  integrasie  binne  hul
eie politieke formasies en  om  die  winste  van  vrede  vir  die  vroue  se
ontwikkeling na vore te bring. Hopelik sal  die  Kongolese  vroue  wat  self
verskillende politieke en samelewingsektore verteenwoordig,  aan  die  einde
van die weeklange vredesforum beter toegerus wees om die mans  van  die  DRK
te help  oorreed  om  'n  standhoudende  vrede  te  sluit.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mrs ANNA VAN WYK: Madam Speaker, the attendance of  a  gathering  like  the
Rassemblement des Femmes pour la Paix - the Meeting, or gathering, of  Women
for Peace - from the Democratic Republic of  the  Congo  and  South  Africa,
which the hon Gillwald referred  to,  is  really  informative.  The  meeting
falls under the umbrella of the African Union  and  Nepad.  The  goals  are,
amongst others, as she mentioned, mutually to exchange strategies about  the
integration of South African women within  their  own  political  formations
and to bring forth the benefits  of  peace  for  the  development  of  these
women. Hopefully  the  Congolese  women  who  themselves  represent  various
political and community sectors will be better equipped at the  end  of  the
week-long peace forum to assist with  convincing  the  men  of  the  DRC  to
conclude a maintained peace.]

The suffering of many of the peoples of Africa was really  brought  home  by
the experiences of these women. They, like millions of women  and  children,
live in conditions devoid of the most basic human rights as a result of  war
and conflict, and are treated as prey and  booty  by  combatants  and  their
sympathisers. The New NP wholeheartedly supports the  initiatives  taken  by
Mrs Zanele Mbeki to assist the Congolese women in their quest for peace  and
development. This kind of action demonstrates  in  practice  South  Africa's
commitment to the objectives of the AU and  Nepad  and  should  in  fact  be
extended to other countries in Africa. In regard to the  DRC,  South  Africa
sets an example worth emulating - and also,  by  the  by,  to  the  previous
colonial  power,  Belgium,  which  does  not  contribute  one  cent  towards
assisting that country.

This makes it all the more baffling that while South Africa is  prepared  to
go to intervene positively and responsibly in the DRC, it refuses to  do  so
for the sake of our own neighbours, our own friends, our own  families,  our
nearest trading partner, Zimbabwe. Not so long ago we even  invaded  Lesotho
at the drop of  a  hat,  when  there  were  mere  intimations  of  political
instability.  Next  door  in  Zimbabwe  there   is   more   than   political
instability.  People  are  being  systematically  stripped  of  their  human
rights, the might of  the  state  is  used  to  hound  and  oppress  popular
opposition and the economy has been destroyed to such an extent that  people
are actually starving and fleeing their  country  in  droves.  South  Africa
could end up having so much on its plate  that  we  shall  not  be  able  to
handle it if we do not take timeous steps.

And the Constitutive Act of the AU  spells  it  all  out.  Here  it  is:  In
Chapter III of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, entitled  ``The
new political  will  of  African  leaders'',  section  49  says  -  and  our
President has signed this:


  To  achieve  these  objectives,   African   leaders   will   take   joint
  responsibility for the following:
     Strengthening  mechanisms  for  conflict  prevention,  management   and
     resolution at the regional and continental levels, and to  ensure  that
     these mechanisms are used to restore and maintain peace;


     Promoting and protecting democracy and human rights in their respective
     countries and regions ...


     Restoring and maintaining macroeconomic stability ...

Suid-Afrikaners is bekommerd oor Zimbabwe en dit sal nie weggaan  totdat  'n
duidelike antwoord gegee word  nie.  [South  Africans  are  concerned  about
Zimbabwe and it wil not go away until a clear answer is given.]

What  precisely  is  our  Government  doing  in  respect  of  these   solemn
undertakings? What is there to hide in silent diplomacy? Trust your  people.
Trust your Parliament. Tell us what you are doing and what your  plans  are.
If you can invite women of civil society in South Africa to Esselen Park  to
help you in your peace efforts in the DRC, you can trust us  and  invite  us
to help with Zimbabwe. South Africans can be  extraordinarily  generous  and
forgiving. Try us! We do not want our closest neighbour to implode. We  want
that country to prosper. It cannot do so if you do not  implement  your  own
undertakings in the Constitutive Act and in Nepad.

As 'n land soos Frankryk weens eie belang hom teen 'n muishond  wil  opvryf,
is dit sy eie saak. Maar Suid-Afrika se gebrek  aan  bewysbare  optrede  ten
opsigte van Mugabe en Zanu-PF  kan  hoegenaamd  geen  vertroue  inboesem  by
Nepad en sy vennote en die res van die  wêreld  nie.  Inteendeel.  Dus,  hoe
gouer die protokol aangaande die instelling van  die  Afrika-Unie  Raad  vir
Vrede en Sekuriteit bekragtig word, hoe beter. Nog nie 'n  enkele  land  het
dit gedoen nie en dit is dalk net die instrument wat die  Regering  soek  om
hom uit sy besluitloosheid te help.

Soos die tyd aanstap, besef 'n mens al hoe meer wat die potensiaal  van  die
Afrika-Unie en Nepad is. Die onderwerp vir vandag se debat,  trouens,  berus
op Afrika se eie doelwitte en ideale  soos  vervat  in  die  Konstitutionele
Akte en die Nepad Program van Aksie. (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[If a country like France wants to associate with a  skunk  owing  to  self-
interest, it is their affair. But South Africa's lack of proven action  with
regard to Mugabe and Zanu-PF can by no means instill confidence  with  Nepad
and its partners and the rest of the world. On the contrary. Therefore,  the
sooner the protocol  concerning  the  establishment  of  the  African  Union
Council for Peace and  Security  is  ratified,  the  better.  Not  a  single
country has as yet done this and it is maybe just the  instrument  that  the
Government is looking for to assist it out of its indecision.

As time marches on one realises more and more  what  the  potential  of  the
African Union and Nepad is. The subject for today's debate  is,  after  all,
based on the individual goals and ideals  of  Africa  as  contained  in  the
Constitutive Act and in the Nepad Programme of Action.]

The role  of  women  in  the  peace  process  and  in  conflict  management,
prevention and resolution was one of the themes of  yesterday's  discussion.
South Africa gained its peace because the leaders sat down, agreed that  the
conflict should end and set about negotiating  a  constitution.  We  laid  a
solid foundation, and it is time now to build that house which Mr  De  Klerk
and Mr Mandela got up to window height. We should  conclude  that  and  take
the roof where it needs to be.

Applying the tenets of the document we have, most particularly  in  our  own
country, would assist all of us to build a stronger,  better  home  for  the
peoples of South Africa. It is all here, and if every politician  and  every
official would study this document and apply what there is, we would  be  on
our way to becoming a model state. I am quite sure the private sector  would
join us in that. This, to a large extent, motivates the  consensus  that  is
required for South Africans to mobilise their formidable resources  to  join
forces and build this continent. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms ANNELIZÉ VAN WYK: Madam Speaker and hon members,  in  times  of  war  and
conflict there can be no talk of human rights. What little  attention  human
rights receive in such periods is focused  on  prisoners  of  war,  not  the
general population. It is a known fact that women are often the  first,  the
unnoticed and the forgotten victims of war. Sadly, the African continent  is
still racked by conflict, war and civil war.

Many of these conflicts have dragged out over many years  or  even  decades.
As a result a culture of human rights abuse takes root. Therefore we  cannot
merely accept that the signing of a peace agreement  to  end  conflict  will
magically restore a culture of respect for human rights. No,  it  will  take
active and concerted efforts to establish  such  a  culture.  Such  efforts,
like the actual negotiations for peace, must not exclude  women.  Women  are
the victims and consequently they should be involved.

Women are caregivers and the centre of family structures. This is even  more
so in times of conflict and war, when men are engaged in  combat  away  from
their homes. Women are thus equipped to establish a caring  and  responsible
society that respects human rights.

While South African efforts in bringing peace in  Africa  must  be  welcomed
and appreciated, we  call  upon  the  Government  to  actively  include  the
development and establishment of human rights and gender equality  in  these
efforts. It is a prerequisite for lasting peace and prosperity.

We must not talk of Africa as if it were another place. We too are  part  of
Africa, and we have to ask ourselves whether the  legislation  and  rhetoric
in favour of women's rights expressed in this House  translate  into  gender
equality in broader society. We must be honest; the answer still  is  no.  A
vast majority of South African women have no idea of their  rights,  or  how
to exercise or access them.

It is also part of this House's duties to empower our people,  also  as  far
as their rights  are  concerned,  so  that  their  lives  can  change  in  a
meaningful manner.  Gender  equality  in  Africa  starts  here.  It  is  not
achieved by a privileged few women in Parliament  being  aware  of  all  the
nice-sounding  and  well-intentioned  gender  programmes.  This  House  must
actively legislate gender equality in each Bill that  comes  before  us.  In
this way, we further contribute to mainstreaming gender equality.

This House must also go a step further. It must rise  to  the  challenge  of
true parliamentary oversight. This means that  our  jobs  extend  to  beyond
merely  rushing  through  as  many  progressive  pieces  of  legislation  as
possible. It requires constant monitoring to ensure  that  that  legislation
is implemented fully and translates into reality for the majority  of  South
African women. I thank you. [Applause.]

Rev K R J MESHOE: Deputy Speaker, the attainment  of  peace  and  democratic
governance in Africa is not only a prerequisite  for  realisation  of  human
rights and gender equality, but it is also imperative for  the  survival  of
the millions of inhabitants of this continent.

There is no  doubt  that  huge  strides  have  been  made  in  many  African
countries towards engendering a human rights culture, particularly  when  it
comes to the removal of racial  and  gender  discrimination.  However,  many
African nations struggle with the basic fundamental prerequisites for  peace
and democracy such as freedom of  the  press,  freedom  of  association  and
religion and the right to oppose the government of the day in a  democratic,
open and fair election.

The continent of Africa, though one  of  the  world's  most  minerally  rich
continents,  is  a  continent  ravaged  by  poverty,   war   and   political
instability.  Although  colonised  and  plundered  by  many   nations   over
centuries, the vast majority  of  African  nations  now  control  their  own
destinies and have the  opportunity  to  turn  their  countries  into  model
nations. However, in most cases the liberator and successor has  become  the
oppressor. Africa is a continent at war with itself, and the numerous  human
rights abuses and wanton destruction of  African  lives  and  property  have
primarily occurred at the hands of its own people. The  fundamental  problem
of this continent is not a  lack  of  intelligent  solutions,  resources  or
finances or the weight of its huge  debt.  At  its  core,  it  is  rebellion
against God, which manifests itself in corruption, theft, idolatry,  endless
wars and a lack of accountability.

The formation of the African  Union  and  the  African  Renaissance  can  do
little to turn the situation around if dictators and oppressive  governments
are allowed to crush democracy and its people with impunity. Clearly  Africa
is far from cultivating a human rights  culture,  as  is  testified  by  the
unbridled human rights abuses perpetrated  by  some  African  leaders.  This
continues the cycle of the African ``Big Men'',  or  untouchables,  as  they
are called in some circles. The ACDP believes that nobody must be above  the
law or be a law to himself. We must get rid of all  the  leaders  who  think
that they are untouchable. If we do not do  that,  Africa  will  not  attain
peace  and  democratic  governance,  which   are   prerequisites   for   the
realisation of human rights. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr G P MNGOMEZULU:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  discussing  this  important
matter we are compelled to turn back the pages  of  history  to  examine  in
particular the terrible, horrible legacy of centuries of colonial  rule  and
domination. We  all  know  that  since  1948  the  worst  form  of  colonial
domination was imposed on all blacks in  this  country  by  the  oppressive,
racist regime that introduced and imposed a vile system on the  overwhelming
majority of our people in this country. It is also a  well-known  fact  that
this vile system was declared a  heresy  or  cancer  on  human  society  and
violated every single vestige of democracy and human rights.

It was during these dark days in our history  as  blacks  that  this  brutal
system introduced the  most  pernicious  laws  that  governed  our  country.
Virtually every law that was passed by the racist  Parliament  was  intended
to divide and sow hatred amongst the  vast  majority  of  our  people.  This
period of our  history  also  saw  the  complete  separation,  division  and
breaking down of our people into racial groups, which led to  the  uprooting
of millions of our people from their original places of residence to  remote
areas. As a result of this abominable policy of  separate  development,  our
people were turned into hewers of wood and drawers of water in  the  country
of their birth.

The notorious hostel  system  and  pass  laws  which  deprived  the  African
workers of the opportunity to lead a decent and dignified  family  life  led
to the brutal disruption and breakup of families and family life.

In spite of the degradation, humiliation and deprivation, our  people,  with
their strong tradition of Ubuntu, resisted  this  humiliation  and  did  not
give up their strong customs,  traditions  and  belief  in  building  strong
bonds within the family, which sustained the  spirit  of  unity,  peace  and
human dignity amongst our people.

After the first democratic  elections  in  our  country,  the  ANC,  as  the
authentic representative of the struggling masses of South  Africa,  drafted
and adopted one of the most progressive constitutions which  the  world  had
ever seen. This Constitution proclaimed, inter alia, a  democratic,  united,
nonsexist and nonracial South Africa. In keeping  with  these  lofty  ideas,
aims and objectives of the Constitution, we have been and  are  working  for
unity, solidarity and peace among our people, both black and  White.  In  so
far as our  transformation  policies  are  concerned,  we  have  made  major
strides in bringing about a better life for all our people.

In his state of the nation address, the President of our country said:


  Crimes against women  and  children  have  received  priority  attention,
  including the establishment of more sexual  offences  courts.  Eleven  of
  these were launched in the last six months alone.

It is a recognised fact  that  crime,  the  abuse  of  women  and  children,
violence against women and children and unemployment in our country came  as
a result of the abnormal and stressful conditions and environment  in  which
our people lived. These conditions, created by the then racist  regime,  led
the masses of our people into abject poverty.

In an attempt to push back the frontiers  of  poverty,  we  can  state  with
pride that we made great improvements in uplifting  the  lives  of  ordinary
people in South Africa by making provision for basic needs such as:  houses,
clean water, health  care,  clinics,  hospitals,  schools,  electricity  and
telephones throughout South Africa and, in particular, in the  rural  areas.
It must be clearly and emphatically stated that this is no mean  achievement
in a period of less than 10 years.

Apart from delivering these basic needs which our people had  been  deprived
of for decades, the ANC-led government also passed a number  of  laws  which
have had a positive impact on securing the rights  of  women  and  children,
for  instance  the  Promotion  of  Equality   and   Prevention   of   Unfair
Discrimination  Act,  the  Choice  on  Termination  of  Pregnancy  Act,  the
Domestic Violence Act, the Maintenance Act and  the  Labour  Relations  Act.
These and many other laws were enacted to strengthen our state, country  and
nation.

Two more pieces of legislation currently being considered  are  one  dealing
with the compulsory HIV testing of alleged sexual offenders  and  the  Child
Justice Bill, which will serve to further enhance the protection and  rights
of women and children. These various transformatory  pieces  of  legislation
will definitely go a long way in bringing  about  peace,  stability,  unity,
prosperity and social progress amongst our people.

History teaches us that women and children suffer the most in times of  war.
In view of the unstable continental and international conditions which  pose
a serious threat to peace,  it  is  therefore  imperative  to  mobilise  our
people against war.

In keeping with the principle of fostering peace, the ANC-led Government  is
spearheading  the  campaign  for  peace  through  the  AU,  the   NAM,   the
Commonwealth and the United Nations. I want  to  take  this  opportunity  to
salute our Government  for  its  efforts  in  Burundi,  the  DRC,  Iraq  and
Palestine.

In conclusion, we want to call upon  all  our  people,  especially  men,  to
strongly support and promote the Government's peace initiatives  for  Africa
and the entire world, and to  condemn,  in  the  strongest  possible  terms,
violence, rape and the abuse of children and women from whatever quarter  it
comes.

Baby rape has become a common phenomenon in South  Africa.  The  reason  for
this is the myth, which is widespread both in South Africa  and  beyond  its
borders, that sex with a child or a baby will rid a man  of  HIV  and  Aids.
Baby Tshepang was only nine months old when she was brutally  raped  in  the
Northern Cape  town  of  Louisvale.  Her  rapists  thought  that  they  were
resolving a problem by brutally and shamelessly  raping  this  innocent  and
defenceless baby.

Furthermore, most men still live in the belief  that  in  our  culture  they
have the final say in so far as family life is concerned. They believe  that
in our culture a woman does not have anything to  say  and  that  the  final
word is that of the man. Sex, according to some of these men,  is  not  open
for discussion; the decision  of  the  head  of  family  is  final,  and  no
correspondence will be entered into. In responding to some  of  these  myths
and reactionary beliefs, our justice system has prioritised sexual  offences
with a review of law and stiffer sentences.

Lastly, I want to quote the director-general of Unesco,  who  said,  on  the
occasion of International Women's Day:


  Until women are fully represented at  the  leadership  level  of  public,
  professional and economic life, we cannot say that they  enjoy  full  and
  equal rights. Women must enjoy truly equal opportunities at each stage of
  their path in professional and public life. This has to be  the  priority
  of all governments, institutions and organisations whose policies  impact
  on the gender balance.

Thank you very much, Comrade Chair. [Applause.]

Mr P H K DITSHETELO: Madam Deputy Speaker, there is a new wave of  political
thinking that continues to sweep through the continent. It  is  nothing  but
the acceptance by most African leaders that it is  time  for  Africa  to  be
given a chance to experience peace and democracy if she  is  to  advance  in
the cause of human rights and gender equality. There are  causes  attributed
to  our  continent's  instability  and  inability  to  establish  democratic
institutions.

The era of post-colonial Africa is fraught with  internal  wars.  It  is  in
this new era of  the  African  Renaissance  that  we  are  now  experiencing
relative peace and stability. It is time that we utilised the newly  created
African  institutions  such  as  the  African  Union  to  deepen  peace  and
democracy on our continent.

We have an opportunity to design these democratic  institutions  to  address
our own peculiar way  of  thinking  and  doing  things  within  the  broader
principles of a democratic society that is underpinned by human  rights  and
gender equality.

For many  years  the  issues  of  gender  equality  in  our  continent  were
presented as if Africans by their nature promoted  gender  inequality.  This
to some extent appears to be true on the surface, but the  real  picture  is
somewhat different. For many years African women occupied  a  special  place
in our community. It was  during  the  era  of  modernisation  that  African
family life was dislodged.

Yes, peace and democracy are prerequisites  for  the  realisation  of  human
rights and gender equality. In essence a democratic society is  expected  to
promote nondiscriminatory and human rights values.  We  are  confident  that
Africa is on course to give birth to such institutions and values.

Re tlaa lwa ka tsotlhe tse re nang le tsona go bona gore bommarona  le  bana
ba rona ba a sireletsega le go bona dithata tse di  ba  tshwanetseng.  Ke  a
leboga. [We will fight with all that we have to ensure that  our  women  and
children are protected and receive the powers that they deserve.]

Dr  M  S  MOGOBA:  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  Human  Rights  Month.  It  is
appropriate that from this House we should  beat  the  drums  of  Africa  on
human rights. The drum is one instrument in Africa that  goes  straight  and
fast to the cores of Africans.

Our appeal is that all of Africa should listen and hear, because,  if  there
is one singular cry or need in Africa, it is human rights. Our human  rights
records in Africa are shocking or virtually nonexistent. Our  subject  today
puts a finger on the problem. We do not start with human  rights,  but  with
peace and  democratic  governance,  which  are  the  prerequisites  for  the
realisation of human rights and gender equality.

We in this country have just emerged  from  one  of  the  severest  wars  of
liberation  in  human  history.  It  was  a  war  principally   about   land
possession, but also about colour. Both these factors  bring  God  into  the
picture.

Why did God create me white or black? Is there anything  one  can  do  about
it? Can I improve my whiteness or blackness? Can we leave the land that  God
has given us and go to another one somewhere?

This unfortunately points the victims to a  war  that  may  be  eternal  and
therefore a situation that would deny us having hope. I want us to  look  at
the Sharpeville tragedy against this  background.  The  massacres,  burnings
and  complete  redirection  of  our  struggle  made  our   struggle   become
continental and international. We owe our thanks to  all  who  came  to  our
help.

A few more critical points need to be made. Apartheid  and  white  supremacy
before it were unfortunate events, but  ironically  the  oppressed  achieved
great unity during this time. I have  heard  many  blacks  praying  for  the
return of apartheid to help us achieve unity and a  clearer  focus  for  our
struggle.

The period of negotiations and reconciliation was a trying test for  us.  It
was a touch-and-go situation, and at any moment we could have  slipped  back
into a situation of no return. The title we  have  of  a  miracle  state  is
somehow correct, and many people really want to know how we got it right.

It is not surprising that all of Africa are already here, and those who  are
not here are shouting for one form of help or  another.  Unfortunately  this
urgent appeal is in the nature of a crisis itself because this  flooding  of
our shores before we have settled down  and  put  human  rights  on  a  firm
footing could destabilise us and kill the one role model that Africa needs.

In our words, we need a firm culture of human rights and gender equality  in
our country to strengthen our image of being the leader and role model.  Our
states in Africa that are not very far from attaining ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! I regret your time has expired, hon member.

Dr M S MOGOBA: I am only halfway. [Laughter.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Only halfway? [Laughter.] [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: Get more votes at the next election!

Dr M S MOGOBA: I'm going to get them. [Interjections.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy  Speaker,  may  I  take  this  opportunity  of
quoting from the speech of our former President, Mr Nelson Mandela, when  he
opened South Africa's first democratically  elected  Parliament  on  24  May
1994:


  It is vitally important that all structures of government, including  the
  President himself, should understand this fully: that freedom  cannot  be
  achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.

It is in terms of the vision of the above statement  that  South  Africa  is
democratic, fair and peaceful. It is then our Constitution that  governs  as
supreme and contains the Bill of  Rights  that  makes  gender  equality  and
human rights a law that shall not be bent. From  there  it  is  society  and
individuals that choose to adhere to and activate such rights. We have  come
a long way and success is visible in many spheres as a result of this.

It is around this skeleton that the present-day South Africa  is  structured
in our way forward  towards  the  attainment  of  democracy,  and  peace  is
crucial if we are to reach these values. The whole of  South  Africa  should
note this: that, no matter the constraints of religion,  culture,  tradition
and so forth, this is possible.

Africa is a heterogeneous continent and human rights violations are  nothing
new. We have had our taste of them for many years. Genocide,  slavery,  mass
disappearance,  torture  and  many  other  fiercely  harsh  realities   have
presented themselves throughout Africa. Democracy, human rights  and  gender
equality go hand in hand in attaining peace.

The MF supports all efforts to  attain  gender  equality  and  human  rights
globally and finds that this is a means to attaining  peace  and  democracy.
[Applause.]

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Adjunkspeaker, ons onderwerp hang nie in die lug nie.  Ons
kan nie maar in 'n vakuum filosofeer oor  die  verband  tussen  demokratiese
landsbestuur en  menseregte  nie.  Ons  onderwerp  kom  aarde  toe  met  dié
kwalifikasie:  ``In  Afrika'',  spesifiek  'n  Afrika  uit  die  periode  na
kolonialisasie en deel van die globale wêreld.

Die verband  is  vanselfsprekend.  Menseregte  en  geslagsgelykheid  is  die
eerste wat in die slag  bly  ten  tye  van  konflik  en  onvrede.  Met  elke
opstand, elke oorlog, elke rebellie, elke etniese konflik is  dit  vroue  en
kinders wat die meeste ly. Swak landsbestuur en  diktatoriale  optrede  deur
leiers bring 'n land op sy knieë en dis vroue en kinders wat ly. Wat  Afrika
betref, kyk maar net na die rye en rye mense wat toustaan vir  rantsoene  in
Zimbabwe en dit is die honger oë van vroue en kinders wat  jou  tref.  Bring
dan  swak  bestuur  en  outoritêre  optrede  by   waardeur   die   rantsoene
gereserveer word vir Zanu-PF lojaliste, en  die  belang  van  ons  onderwerp
word nog duideliker.

Kontrasteer die flambojante weelde van 'n  Gaddafi  en  sy  gevolg  met  die
duisende honger vroue en kinders in Libië  en  u  verstaan  wat  ek  bedoel.
Daarom is dit so noodsaaklik dat die portuurgroepkontrole in Afrika nie  net
kan handel oor ekonomiese  sake  nie,  maar  dat  demokratiese  landsbestuur
onlosmaaklik daarvan deel uitmaak. In daardie opsig moet Afrika vir  homself
verantwoordelikheid aanvaar.

Onder menseregte verstaan ons ook nie net individuele regte  nie,  maar  ook
die  regte  van  taal-,  kultuur-  en  godsdienstige  gemeenskappe.  Op   'n
kontinent met sy talle minderheidsgemeenskappe is dit  'n  voorvereiste  vir
vrede en menseregte. Tog sal  daar  groot  duidelikheid  moet  kom  oor  die
verantwoordelikheid van die staat, afgegrens teenoor dit van die  burgerlike
samelewing. Hoewel elkeen soewerein is in eie kring, kan dit  nie  toegelaat
word dat praktyke soos genetiese manipulasie,  onderdrukking  van  vroue  en
selfs  kinderoffers  en  mutimoorde  onder  die  dekmantel   van   godsdiens
toegelaat word nie.

Die AEB ondersteun die beginsels van Nepad en die  Afrika  Renaissance.  Die
eerste verantwoordelikheid begin egter in Afrika. Slegs wanneer erns  gemaak
word met ware demokrasie, kan daar van menseregte en geslagsgelykheid  enige
sprake wees. Ek dank u. (Translation of Afrikaans speech follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Hon Deputy Speaker, our subject is not suspended in  the  air.
We cannot simply philosophise in a vacuum  about  the  relationship  between
democratic governance of a country and human rights. Our subject comes  down
to earth with this qualification: "in Africa", specifically an  Africa  from
the period after colonialisation and part of the global world.

The connection is obvious. Human rights and gender equality  are  the  first
to fall victim in times of conflict and the absence  of  peace.  With  every
revolt, every war, every rebellion, every ethnic conflict it  is  the  women
and children who suffer the most. Poor governance  and  dictatorial  actions
by leaders bring a country to its knees and it is  the  women  and  children
who suffer. As far as Africa is concerned, just look at the  rows  and  rows
of people who are queuing up for rations in Zimbabwe and it  is  the  hungry
eyes  of  women  and  children  that  hit  one.  Add  poor  governance   and
authoritarian actions through which the rations  are  reserved  for  Zanu-PF
loyalists, and the interest of our subject becomes even clearer.

Contrast the flamboyant luxury of a  Gaddafi  and  his  entourage  with  the
thousands of hungry women and children in  Libya  and  you  will  understand
what I mean. For that reason it is so essential that the peer control  group
in Africa should not only be able to deal with economic  affairs,  but  that
democratic governance of the country should also be an inseparable  part  of
it. In that regard Africa must accept responsibility for itself.

We not only understand human rights to mean individual rights, but also  the
rights of linguistic, cultural and religious  communities.  On  a  continent
with many minority groups it is a condition  for  peace  and  human  rights.
Nevertheless,  a  great  deal  of  clarity  must  be  obtained   about   the
responsibility of the state, as opposed to that of civil  society.  Although
each is sovereign in its own circle, one  cannot  allow  practices  such  as
genetic manipulation, suppression of women and  even  child  sacrifices  and
muti murders to take place under the protection of religion.

The AEB supports the principles of Nepad and the  African  Renaissance.  The
first responsibility, however, starts in Africa. Only  once  real  democracy
is taken seriously can there be any question  of  human  rights  and  gender
equality. I thank you.]

Mr M WATERS: Deputy Speaker, it is a great honour for me to be  speaking  in
this debate on gender equality today as a male.

A great woman once said: ``In politics, if you want something  said,  ask  a
man; if you want anything  done,  ask  a  woman.''  I  am  in  fact  quoting
Margaret Thatcher. I would like to add to that quote: In life, if  you  want
anything said, ask a man; if you want anything done, ask a woman.

Only a fool would say there has been little or no progress  with  regard  to
gender equality since the 1994 election. Many strides  have  been  made  and
many more still have to be taken. Parliament is a far  cry  from  the  years
when only one woman sat in these benches. Helen Suzman sat in  this  Chamber
on her own for eight years. As the only woman,  the  only  liberal  and  the
only anti-apartheid MP, Helen Suzman knew exactly what it was like to  be  a
woman in a so-called man's world.

But still, the more things change, the more they stay the same. We have  yet
to have the first female head of any African country. Who  knows,  maybe  we
will be the first. I look forward to  seeing  women  taking  their  rightful
place as heads of  political  parties,  and  a  woman  as  a  head  of  this
Government in the future.

The Draft Protocol to the African Charter on Human and  Peoples'  Rights  of
Women in Africa promotes gender equality throughout Africa. However, no  law
or protocol is worth the paper it is written on if it cannot be enforced.  A
glaring example of this is the case of Amina Lawal,  a  Nigerian  woman  who
bore a child out of wedlock and  was  sentenced  to  death  by  stoning  for
adultery. Again our Government remains silent on the issue.

The protocol outlaws gender-based violence such as rape. [Interjections.]

You remain silent and that's a fact.

In South Africa over 50 000 women and 22 000 children are raped every  year.
No one can say that women are free in this country. They  are  prisoners  of
fear. Every time they leave their homes and go to work,  school  or  church,
they live in fear of being raped. These figures are  reported  crimes  only,
and they reflect the situation on the ground - that eight women,  girls  and
babies are raped every hour in this country. This is a  crime  committed  by
men against women.

Apart from the horrific trauma a person must go through after  being  raped,
there is little comfort for many victims, as the justice system  -  and  I'm
sure the hon Deputy Minister will agree with me - resembles a field of  land
mines waiting to explode at any time as the victim tries in vain  to  obtain
a successful conviction. Less than 10% of all rapes in this  country  result
in a successful conviction. That means 90% of rapists get away with  it.  If
we were all back at school, the rapists would score an  A  on  their  report
cards, and the victims would fail dismally.  And  the  hon  Deputy  Minister
calls this empowerment.

A national survey on violence against  women  revealed  the  following.  The
seriousness of the  problem  has,  since  1994,  been  acknowledged  at  the
highest  levels  of  government,  evidenced   in   many   speeches,   policy
statements, strategies and legislation. Violence against women is  also  the
only focus area that has consistently been included in  the  guidelines  and
funding frameworks for almost every foreign donor.

Despite the level of attention, three factors were identified  as  stumbling
blocks to combating the wave of violence against women. The  first  is  that
resources and energy have too often been wasted on debates about the  extent
of the problem and how to measure it. The second is that there are  too  few
projects that aim systematically to monitor and evaluate the impact  of  the
different strategies and responses.  This  is  unfortunate,  as  our  scarce
resources need to be directed to those projects that are likely  to  produce
the best results. And thirdly, many of the efforts of both governmental  and
nongovernmental organisations to research and assist survivors  of  violence
have been focused on metropolitan areas. I took that from the book  Violence
Against Women, published last year.

Another factor that will ensure that  many  women  remain  in  the  grip  of
poverty is that of HIV/Aids. Currently HIV/Aids infects more women  than  it
does men, as it  is  easier  for  women  to  contract  the  disease  due  to
biological, social and economic patterns. The current Government's  response
to the pandemic is  to  send  a  mixed  bag  of  messages  -  a  ``Liquorice
Allsorts'' response to what is the greatest  killing  machine  this  country
has ever known.

Our Government spends more time in court fighting the messenger  than  being
in the field combating the disease.  The  hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Justice
talks about empowerment of women.  However,  when  Mugabe's  thugs  rampaged
through Zimbabwe raping suspected MDC supporters,  our  Government  remained
silent on that issue. So much for empowerment again, hon Deputy Minister.

According to the book AIDS: The Challenge for  South  Africa,  South  Africa
has the largest number of HIV-infected people of any country in  the  world.
The only nation that  comes  close  in  actual  numbers  is  India,  with  a
population of 1 billion, compared to our 42 million.

With approximately 2,5 million  women  facing  the  death  sentence  in  our
country through the Government's refusal to treat HIV-infected people,  many
people, including myself, are calling it state-sponsored  genocide.  Another
contributing factor to the spread of HIV is  that  many  men  still  believe
that by raping a virgin you will be cured of HIV. This could not be  further
from the truth. All you are doing is sentencing an innocent child to death.

What the HIV pandemic does mean for women, though, is that when mothers  die
young girls take over the running of households. Many of them leave  school,
destroying any chance of furthering their education,  and  accept  the  fact
that they will probably have the same fate as their mothers.

Men in South Africa have to change their attitudes towards women.  They  are
not  beating-boards  or  sexual  objects,  and  unless  we  as  men  make  a
determined effort to change, the women of our country will  never  be  truly
free and neither will we. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr B M DOUGLAS: Madam Deputy Speaker, I think that my colleagues  who  spoke
before me have really done justice to this. Minister, so to speak,  this  is
the yawning time of the debate, but nevertheless I shall perhaps focus  more
on the legacy and the transgenerative effects of colonialism on this  debate
of today.

I am thinking of the body politic of  Africa.  What  worms  are  within  the
entrails - as Rousseau would like to have me say - in this body politic  and
how do we expel them? Yes,  it  is  true  that  the  agenda  for  peace  and
security in  Africa  is  inescapably  tied  to  humane  governance,  social,
cultural and economic equity, human rights and democracy. I want to  compare
it to a body: When I talk about the body politic I want us  to  think  of  a
body. In this instance, I'm thinking of when  the  brain  doesn't  give  the
message to the heart to pump the blood. The lungs then won't  function,  the
kidneys won't perform their excretory function and at the  end  of  the  day
the whole body will collapse. In this instance,  after  the  collapse  of  a
body a  postmortem  has  to  be  done.  That  is  why  I  want  to  come  to
colonialism, because a postmortem indeed reveals - according to  Prof  Nagan
- in Africa that Africa  has  been  exploited  by  historical  forces  whose
collective  legacies,  especially  conflict,  are  still  having   lingering
transgenerational  effects  because  of  the  overthrowing   of   forms   of
authority,  economic  and  political  dislocation,   cultural   deprivation,
religious  conversion,  physical  abuse,   disenfranchisement,   etc.   This
actually transmutated into the body politic of so many  new  democracies  in
Africa right now.

I don't want to mention what happened in the DRC during Belgian rule,  where
over  50   million   people   perished,   or   in   Algeria   where   French
institutionalised policies and practices of state terror  have  in  reaction
unleashed  more  revolutionary  violence,  again  resulting   now   in   the
institutionalisation of the expectation of violence still being prevalent.

Let's go back to the Cold War. Seductive  embraces  for  superpower  support
immeasurably protracted conflicts in Africa, and I can mention  what  Robert
Sobukwe said. He said that this wooing process occurs at  a  time  when  the
whole continent of Africa is in labour, suffering the pangs  of  birth,  and
everybody is looking anxiously to  see  ukuthi  iyozala  nkomoni  [what  the
result will be]. Mother Africa nearly had a nervous breakdown when she  gave
birth to Amin,  Leopold  Senghor,  Houphouet-Boigny,  Mobutu  and  Verwoerd.
Someone said  that  the  superpowers  of  the  time  were  transporting  and
localising the theatre of the  Cold  War  from  the  faraway  continents  to
Africa.

One should also not forget the  consequences  of  post-war  Liberia,  Sierra
Leone  and  other  African  countries  with  colonially   dominated   mining
enterprises where diamonds and other minerals became the  currency  for  the
support of the murder of boys and  fathers  and  children.  Let's  not  talk
about Saro-Wiwa, or Patrice Lumumba  or  other  breadwinners  or  about  the
nonintervention of the United  Nations  and  other  powers  in  the  Rwandan
genocide.

Before I become an apologist for  whichever  way  or  the  devil's  advocate
asking for mitigation of sentence in the African  Nuremburg  trial,  let  me
also  ask  for  reasons  that  might  have  prompted  Angola,  Namibia   and
Zimbabwe's adventure into the DRC, or  for  what  the  5th  Brigade  did  in
Matabeleland in Zimbabwe. The prophet Isaiah asks:  ``Is  there  a  balm  in
Gilead?'' Is the presupposition an axiomatic truth that a  democratic  state
will necessarily engage in good governance?

Are society and social organisation structured in a complementary  way  with
regard to the problems of conflict and prevention, as well as  developmental
imperatives in South Africa, or are we as Africans not simply responding  to
the cancerous limbs by putting plaster on them rather than amputating  them?
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights  warns  that  if  humanity  is  to
prevent the scourge of war and rebellion, there must  be  universal  respect
for human  rights,  peace  and  justice.  Democracy  and  human  rights  are
interdependent. The compromising of peace accelerates the process  of  human
rights violation.

Let us accept the challenge from our President of the country when  he  said
in his opening address to Parliament in 2001:


  The day will dawn when we, as Africans, will, as all our  people  desire,
  restore the situation that obtained at periods now dimmed by the mists of
  time, when Africans were in the vanguard of the  advance  towards  higher
  levels of civilisation.

Asazi ukuthi iyozala nkomoni kwi-Nepad. [We do not know what the results  of
Nepad will be.] Thank you.

Ms T R MODISE: Deputy Speaker, I do believe that  the  attainment  of  peace
and democratic governance in Africa is a prerequisite  for  the  realisation
of human rights and gender equality for her citizens.

My colleagues have come here and they have spoken at length about the  steps
that South Africa has taken since 1994 to improve the quality  of  life  and
status of women. They have also looked  at  the  instruments  that  we  have
established to bring equality. They have also spoken about the  shortcomings
in some of these instruments. They have also referred to a number of  pieces
of legislation that we have passed to try and  rectify  this.  A  number  of
them have also spoken about the rights of  the  girl  child  as  opposed  to
those of the boy child.

I believe that our definition of peace should include not just  the  absence
of war and conflict, but also  the  right  to  expect  and  receive  quality
service and respect. We have the right to live without  fear  as  women,  we
have the right to express ourselves in the many languages of our people,  we
have right to enjoy the many cultures of Africa without fear  or  prejudice.
We must be dignified, and we must respect one  another's  views  and  accept
that as women we are not homogeneous and we have the right to differ and  to
express these differences in the various aspects of our lives.

Peace cannot exist without stable conditions for law and order and  for  the
respect of human rights. Peace cannot exist only at  certain  times  and  at
certain places. Women have the right to feel safe anywhere  and  everywhere.
The violence that we experience in our houses and  at  our  workplaces  must
stop.
Continental peace cannot exist without common  beliefs  and  commitments  to
good governance. African women want and deserve good governments  that  will
heed their needs. A batho ba bewe kwa pele. [Put  the  people  first.]  Good
government would emphasise good services to the people,  a  government  that
will be accountable to its people and a government that  will  avail  itself
to scrutiny by its people.

We therefore suggest that  one  of  the  measures  of  good  governance  and
respect for human rights should  be  the  extent  to  which  African  states
recognise women's rights and integrate  them  into  their  understanding  of
what are termed human rights.

Mr G B D McINTOSH: What about polygamy?

Ms T R MODISE: I am  coming  to  that.  Peace  cannot  exist  when  resource
allocations remain skewed. Democracy must mean the ability of  the  majority
to participate in the political, social and economic life of their  country.
There is therefore a need to empower people to be  equal.  If  there  is  no
equal access to participation, can we speak of democratic practices? If  the
conditions of most African women are such that equal participation  will  be
limited, can we speak of democracy? We are the majority  on  the  continent,
we are also the poorest, we are also the most  illiterate,  victims  of  war
that we do not begin, victims of rape, of emotional, physical and  financial
abuse. And yet the world says it is going  forward,  and  we  African  women
seem to be standing  in  one  place  and  not  catching  up  with  our  male
counterparts.

That is why in December I was amongst a small group of  African  women  that
went and had talks with  the  World  Bank  and  insisted  that  criteria  to
finance the projects of Nepad must be revised and  that  the  benefiting  of
native women must be one of those criteria. It is  therefore  necessary  for
African leaders to listen to African  women.  We  are,  after  all,  in  the
majority.

South Africa has laid a firm  foundation  to  eradicate  corruption  in  the
public and private sector. Is it possible for us to multiply the effects  of
what we have put into South Africa for the rest of Africa?  Is  it  possible
to have continental moral regeneration programmes that will help us  develop
common values and standards? Is  it  the  right  of  the  minority  to  take
decisions about the fate of the majority  with  continued  impunity?  Is  it
then not time for African women to call on our men and our leaders  to  stop
delaying our development by engaging in  senseless  wars  that  destroy  our
land's ability to produce food, that destroy the  futures  of  our  children
and reduce us to sexual and economic slaves? Is it not time  for  Africa  to
listen to women? We want our singing back, we want  our  laughter  back,  we
want our children's dreams, we want to till our lands. And  we  demand  that
respect return for  the  Sudanese,  Nigerian,  Senegalese,  DRC,  Burundian,
Somalian, Sierra Leonean and Liberian women.

Africa cannot continue to hide behind religious laws and cultural  practices
that exclude women from the decision-making structures of our continent.  We
cannot be used as adornment and  decorations  forever.  African  women  must
talk about power relations or else the dream of an African Renaissance  will
remain futile and but a dream. [Applause.] We must honestly discuss  whether
we must continue to accept the number of wives a man has as a  yardstick  of
his power, his economic status and his sexual prowess. Do we  want  that  as
African women? [Interjections.]

Our Constitution  sets  out  our  objectives  as  a  united,  nonsexist  and
nonracist South Africa. These noble ideas must be transplanted to  the  rest
of the continent. Had we done this in time, maybe we would not have had  the
genocide in both Burundi and Rwanda.

African women are still subjected to more restrictions than their  men,  and
girl children are still not exposed to equal school  opportunities.  So  how
can we look towards an Africa of tomorrow that is without prejudice,  if  we
do not start correcting these things? The roles that we still  are  expected
to play as African women are still largely determined by the  character  and
orientation of the ruling majorities. Is this the  way  ahead?  Is  the  way
ahead better than the past, or are we still marking time? Yes,  it  is  time
for the  African  women  to  move  forward  and  to  romp  to  equality  and
democracy,  but  to  get  there  we  must  use  our  rights  to  access,  to
participate in, economic and social activities in  our  countries.  We  must
utilise the education opportunities and we must  exercise  our  freedoms  of
association and expression to be where we need to be as  women  and  so  say
what we need to say.

The fourth pillar of the struggle against apartheid was the mobilisation  of
international  support   and   solidarity.   We   must   therefore   observe
International Women's Day today,  remembering  our  sisters  in  Israel,  in
Palestine. We must also express our fears about  the  possible  war  against
Iraq. We are not only worried about the possible loss of life and  property,
we are worried about the effects, the impact on our lands,  we  are  worried
that Africa's dreams of development for her women  might  be  forced  to  be
delayed.

We are worried about the tyranny that  we  saw  unleashed.  When  the  world
expresses its disagreement against the war, is it not scandalous  that  some
people do not listen? When women all over  the  world  offer  themselves  as
human shields, is it not time to listen? Must we go and bare  our  nakedness
to Mr Bush before he will listen? Maybe he  will  understand  that  the  war
will not only deprive these women in the Middle East, it  will  also  reduce
their lives and their dignity. It will also unleash  hardships  and  reverse
all the little gains women have made all over the world.  The  possible  war
with Iraq delays our development. It means that  democratic  processes  will
be delayed and therefore that the real recognition of the  rights  of  women
and the integration  thereof  into  development  programmes  will  not  take
place. This war can only be pleasing manufacturers of war weapons. They  are
the only people who will make profits.

We sat glued to our TV sets, almost unbelieving, because  the  first  people
who fled Afghanistan were old women with  little  children.  This,  we  were
told, was going to be the war against terrorism. This was going to  liberate
the people of Afghanistan against the  tyranny  of  the  Taliban.  This  was
going to end their misery and bring peace  to  these  good  old  people  who
couldn't have been responsible anyway for the bombs that fell in  New  York.
These were the old  people  who  were  not  consulted  when  America  helped
establish the Taliban. These were  the  old  people  who  feared  for  their
lives, who had seen the devastation of the so-called war against  oppression
by foreign  troops  in  Serbia  and  in  Kosovo.  These  old  people,  these
desperate people like me, could not understand why the guns  were  aimed  at
the victims while the so-called oppressors literally got away  with  murder.
These women are still puzzled and I am still puzzled.  Why  must  the  world
suffer when the Taliban and  Bin  Laden,  Milosevic  and  Saddam,  America's
chickens, come home to roost?

We still watch in horror and helplessness the extent  to  which  human  life
has been  devalued  in  the  war  for  the  liberation  and  recognition  of
Palestine. We watch with interest and listen to the  sermons  about  respect
for life and human rights. When do we see this in practice? When do  we  see
people practising this and respecting the life  of  the  Palestinian  child,
the life of the Israeli child, the  life  of  the  Israeli  and  Palestinian
women?

Our thoughts go to the women of Afghanistan, of India, of  Ethiopia  and  of
Eritrea. We congratulate our sisters in Burundi on forging  ahead.  We  also
congratulate our sisters in the DRC on getting over all the horrors  of  the
foreign armies that converged  on  Congo,  killing,  raping,  disinhabiting,
looting and maiming. As women of Africa, we are against  the  deployment  of
all foreign troops that try to justify their presence in  foreign  countries
to avoid domestic situations such as  those  in  Zimbabwe,  in  Namibia,  in
Uganda and in Rwanda. I could go on, because  there  were  Liberia,  Nigeria
and Ghana, there are Senegal, the Ivory Coast  and  Sierra  Leone  -  and  I
could go on and on.

I could come back to South Africa a few months ago  -  in  December,  to  be
precise - when, as South African  women,  we  were  worried  sick.  We  were
worried sick because the spectre of the return of violence was hanging  over
our heads. Never again, never again must we be subjected to the  uncertainty
that South African women faced when KwaZulu-Natal was poised, was poised  to
go into political or violent conflict. Never again must we be  subjected  to
the emotional trauma we went through as women of this country.  Never  again
must we remain silent and be taken back to the horrors of multiple  funerals
and bloodletting that we went through.

As a person, as an African woman,  if  I  were  to  leave  any  word  to  my
children and my children's children, it would be to ask Africa to awake  and
to beware that she not be forced to go to sleep again. It would  be  for  us
to be vigilant and to let our hearts beat together. It would  be  to  awaken
the burning passion in our eyes with our hands of  steel  on  the  democracy
that we must still forge. It would  be  to  pray  and  work  very  hard  for
democracy and development so that we  strengthen  the  foundations  we  have
laid. We must never allow, not any of us, male or female, the ideas  of  our
vision to fade, to become rusty. If we do, Nkosi Sikelela  will  be  jarring
and Mayibuye i-Afrika will become jaded. [Applause.]
The DEPUTY SPEAKER: That concludes the debate on this subject. Hon  members,
may I add a word of congratulations in particular for  the  fact  that  more
than  40%  of  the  people  who  participated  in  this  debate  were  male.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

                        PENSIONS (SUPPLEMENTARY) BILL

                               (Introduction)

The  MINISTER   OF   FINANCE:   Deputy   Speaker,   this   Bill   is   quite
straightforward. A certain Mr Clarke was employed on Marion Island  and  had
been paralysed. He was dissatisfied with the pension  of  R1 500  per  month
that the rules of the Government Employees Pension Fund allowed him.

He  petitioned  Parliament.  The  Portfolio  Committee  on  Private  Members
Legislative Proposals and Petitions agreed to increase this amount,  and  so
an additional monthly pension of R1 500  per  month,  with  effect  from  15
March 2002, and arrears additional pensions going back to 1  September  2001
would be granted in terms of the supplementary Bill here before us. I  thank
you. [Applause.]
Bill referred to the Portfolio Committee on Finance  for  consideration  and
report.

                          INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The  MINISTER  OF  FINANCE:  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  members,  the  insurance
industry has been through a torrid period, especially since  the  events  of
11 September 2001, and also as a result of  the  losses  incurred  with  the
economic meltdown in the global economy.

What this Bill does is assist our insurance industry here by  improving  the
requirements  in  three  important  areas.  The  first  is  the   prudential
soundness of the insurance company; the second  is  its  adherence  to  good
corporate governance; and the third  is  the  protection  and  education  of
policyholders.

At the end of the day I think that when we look at this Bill, we  must  look
at it from the perspective of two broad areas: the one area which this  Bill
entrenches and reinforces is consumer protection; and the other area is  the
protection of shareholder interests. These  come  together  to  ensure  that
insurance companies are better managed in the interests  of  those  insured.
Thank you, Deputy Speaker. [Applause.]

Ms B A HOGAN: Madam Deputy Speaker, the Bill before  us  refines  two  major
Bills that were put through Parliament in the last parliamentary  session  -
two Bills for short-term and long-term insurance. I'm not going to  go  into
the details of that. When this Bill  was  introduced,  it  was  covered  and
canvassed widely. There is a whole range of mainly technical details.

The Bill was uncontroversial apart from one issue which arose  late  in  the
day. I will explain why we took the  position  we  did  on  that.  There  is
another issue which I would also like  to  raise  in  connection  with  this
Bill.

The first issue that the committee was constrained to look at was  what  was
called the famous in duplum rule. In  the  previous  legislation,  prior  to
this new piece of  legislation  being  passed,  an  exemption  was  formally
granted to the insurance industry to allow it to loan and, when  it  loaned,
for interest to accumulate beyond the amount of  the  capital  loaned.  That
exemption was withdrawn when the two new Bills came  before  this  House  in
our previous Parliament - in about 1998 or 1999.

When the amendments to this Bill came  to  us  now,  the  intention  was  to
remove that exemption so that, unlike other  financial  services  providers,
the insurance industry would now be able to loan and, if that loan  was  not
repaid, the interest could  accumulate  beyond  the  value  of  the  capital
loaned.

A number of our organisations, including the Black Sash and  Cosatu,  and  a
number of individuals made submissions to us, and it  appeared  to  us  that
these had real merit. Firstly, regarding a loan that is granted in terms  of
a policy, what happens is that quite often the person  who  makes  the  loan
does not pay back the loan, but when the policy  is  paid  out,  he  or  she
takes back the policy less what is owed the company. So this almost  becomes
a long-term loan.

The industry argued that if we withdrew this exemption, people would not  be
able to borrow against their policies, and also that if this  exemption  was
not granted it would prejudice other people who  had  bought  policies  from
the company concerned because some people  would  be  getting  loans,  these
loans would not be repaid and, therefore, those who  were  still  continuing
to pay would be prejudiced.

However, when we looked at this it was very clear that those who took  loans
continued to pay their premiums on their  policies.  The  policies  did  not
cease. They continued to pay  the  premiums.  It  seemed  to  us  manifestly
unfair that one sector in the financial services industry should enjoy  that
exemption.

But this goes beyond that. It is also manifestly unfair that  for  a  person
who does borrow, the debt can accumulate far  beyond  the  amount  that  was
initially borrowed. So on those grounds - and there are  more  arguments  to
and fro - we felt that we could, unfortunately, not grant the industry  that
exemption.

The second issue which I want to raise - just a small issue  raised  in  the
Bill - is related to  the  short-term  insurance  industry.  The  short-term
insurance industry may not sell a product and call it a funeral  benefit  or
a funeral policy. The short-term insurance industry only gives loans  for  a
year. Therefore, how can they be giving a funeral benefit, a death  benefit,
for longer than that period of time?

But linked to that - and this is a very welcome amendment - is  the  ongoing
abuse, which is coming to the attention of our  committee,  in  the  funeral
industry. We have fly-by-night  companies  offering  funeral  benefits,  but
when people have died those benefits can no longer be accessed.

People living with Aids have  given  evidence  to  our  committees  here  in
Parliament in that often the insurance policies that  are  taken  out  don't
make it clear that if you take out that insurance  policy  and  you  die  of
Aids, that policy becomes null and void. Horrifying stories have  been  told
to us of people who  have  taken  out  such  insurance  policies  where  the
company  has  agreed  and  undertaken  to  take  care  of  all  the  funeral
arrangements. However, they take the bodies and then refuse to pay  out  the
funeral benefits because they say that the benefits have been  nullified  by
the person dying of Aids and therefore he or she  doesn't  qualify  for  the
benefits so they do not release the body. The family goes  through  enormous
trauma in trying to bury their dead because the funeral parlours  hold  onto
those bodies.
This is only the start.  Certain  members  of  our  committee  have  already
agreed that we want to explore the abuses that are going on in  the  funeral
insurance industry. So this amendment is a  welcome  step  forward  in  that
regard. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  colleagues,  this  Bill  takes  the
process of prudential regulation of both long-term and short-term  insurance
one step further by introducing substantive  new  minimal  capital  adequacy
provisions in line with  international  standards.  These  developments  are
welcome.

Section 59 of the Long-Term Insurance Act and Section 53 of  the  Short-Term
Insurance Act are amended to clarify  the  law,  following  two  conflicting
views expressed in the Supreme  Court  of  Appeal.  The  proposed  amendment
favours the judgment of the court in the matter  of  Clifford  v  Commercial
Union. It ensures that the test for the materiality of  a  misrepresentation
or nondisclosure by an insurer will  be  an  objective  test,  the  question
being  what  a  reasonable,  prudent  person,  and  not  the  insurer  in  a
particular situation, would have regarded as material for the assessment  of
the relevant risk. These developments are equally welcome.

Clause 22,  as  well  as  the  new  Schedule  3,  increases  the  scope  for
regulatory discretion in the hands of  the  FSB.  The  DA  trusts  that  the
insurance industry will be brought into  the  consultation  process  between
the FSB and the Actuarial Society  of  SA  in  the  calculation  of  assets,
liabilities and the new capital adequacy requirements provided for  in  this
Bill, and in determining  what  securities  can  be  regarded  for  solvency
purposes. If industry is not sufficiently consulted in this  regard  by  the
regulator, the industry and the regulator will be  at  constant  loggerheads
in implementing the new  system  of  prudential  requirements  and  the  new
prudential provisions.

There is a corporate governance early-warning-system  provision  in  section
18 that could act as an important warning light  of  any  serious  corporate
failures or impending failures in the long-term insurance  industry  sector.
It requires any director or managing executive who resigns, or  has  his  or
her appointment terminated, to alert the Financial  Services  Board  to  any
matter of which he or she may have become aware in the  performance  of  his
or her duties that may hamper the insurance company's  compliance  with  the
provisions of the Insurance Act, as amended by this Bill before  the  House.
This might still prove to be a groundbreaking provision, as  concerns  about
the  individual's  right  not  to  self-incriminate  have  been  taken  into
consideration.

As Mr Neil Krige of the Life Offices' Association has pointed out, the long-
term insurance industry has  taken  constructive  steps  to  develop  a  BEE
framework to form part of an overall black economic empowerment charter  for
the financial services sector. As he says:


  The LOA has therefore  initiated  a  process  to  analyse  the  long-term
  insurance industry's  contribution  to  BEE.  These  proposed  indicators
  include ownership of companies operating within the industry,  management
  and control of these companies,  employment  equity  policies  and  human
  resources and skills development strategies. Also of  importance  to  the
  industry are corporate social investment activities,  financing  of  BEE,
  socially desirable investments, partnerships with  SMMEs  and  guidelines
  regarding procurement.

This is clearly a holistic approach to the concept of BEE and, I might  add,
was developed without the strong-arm tactics of the mining charter.

The Minister of Finance has now lifted the veil on the  financing  of  black
economic empowerment slightly. What industry across all  sectors,  not  only
the long-term insurance industry and/or the financial services  industry  in
general, are requiring is  certainty,  certainty  and  certainty  about  the
black economic empowerment policy, as it will be rolled out.

We require certainty about the enabling legislation  and  the  amendment  of
existing legislation, including the Industrial Development Corporation  Act,
the National Empowerment Fund Act and any other ancillary  legislation  that
might require further amendment and/or policy change. These details have  to
be released as soon as possible by the Department of Trade and Industry.

An approach must be adopted - I crucially emphasise:  an  approach  must  be
adopted - that allows for maximum initiative in the hands and  on  the  part
of industry in any and all sectors of the South African economy.
The DA supports this Bill. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Madam Deputy Speaker, the original  Insurance  Amendment  Bill
which was submitted to the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance  comprised  41
clauses, each of which amended provisions in both  the  Long-Term  Insurance
Act and the Short-term Insurance Act. It is significant  that  only  one  of
these proposed amendments was strongly contested, as pointed  out  a  moment
ago by the hon Hogan, and this was only by two or three of  the  56  parties
to whom the Bill was originally referred.

The clause in question was that which would have removed the in duplum  rule
as it stands in the Long-Term Insurance Act and as it currently pertains  to
loans  made  by  insurers  to  policy  holders.  In  addition  to   the   54
nonobjecting parties, the removal of the in duplum provision  was  supported
by the National  Treasury  and  was  strongly  motivated  by  the  Financial
Services Board and the life assurance offices representing the industry.

The arguments which they articulated were based  on  a  number  of  consumer
advantages and legal difficulties administering the rule. The rule has  long
been discarded elsewhere in the world, and other arguments were referred  to
earlier by the hon Hogan. On the other hand there  were  Cosatu,  the  Black
Sash and an obscure body calling itself the  In  Duplum  Association,  which
expressed  the  concern  that  the  removal  of  the  provision  could   see
unscrupulous insurance companies taking advantage of  and  exploiting  those
people to whom they had lent,  especially  regarding  the  possibilities  of
excessive interest on the arrear interests of the  loans  in  question.  The
Financial Services Board countered this by pointing  out  that  the  lenders
would still be protected under the  Usury  Act  and  the  Prescription  Act,
especially regarding interest rates.

There was the other issue also referred to earlier on that  there  was  some
concern about the lenders getting themselves  into  problems,  but  there  I
think an opposing view was that people in all endeavours  of  life  and  all
transactions must  take  some  responsibility  for  themselves,  and  we  as
legislators must not try to become part of a nanny state situation.

So the committee  then,  for  reasons  which  I  do  not  fully  understand,
rejected the proposed amendment without, as far as I  could  follow  at  the
time, being able to refute the  actual  documented  FSB  arguments.  I  felt
obliged to abstain from the committee vote on the basis  that  I  found  the
FSB arguments to be quite compelling and that perhaps there was another  way
for us to have dealt with the excessive loan situation or  the  one  or  two
dangers which we had witnessed by way of another inclusion in the Bill.

Notwithstanding the difficulty I have with the way the committee  considered
this particular part of the Bill, the  issue  in  question,  when  evaluated
within the overall scope  of  the  Bill's  other  amendments  -  very  sound
amendments - is simply not a big enough issue to have us  oppose  the  Bill.
Thank you.

Dr P  J  RABIE:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  hon  Minister,  hon  members,  the
Insurance Amendment Bill provides for amendments to the Long-Term  Insurance
Act and the Short-Term Insurance Act. The object of this Bill is  to  update
and consolidate  the  insurance  industry's  legal  framework  in  terms  of
generally accepted international legal principles.

It is estimated that 13,5 million South  Africans  qualify  for  short-  and
long-term insurance. The low-income market size is roughly 6 million  policy
holders with salaries between R4 000 and R5 000  per  month.  The  following
variables must be seen within the industry as evaluated, namely,  first  and
foremost, inflation; secondly, unemployment;  and,  thirdly,  the  potential
disruptive effects of HIV/Aids.

The Portfolio Committee on Finance discussed this  Bill,  and  a  submission
stated that the death rate in the low-income market in  the  30  to  40  age
range is expected to double in the foreseeable future as  a  result  of  the
impact of Aids. We appeal to all the role-players to take timeous  proactive
steps to enable the lower-income segment to afford insurance  products.  The
viability of  equity  markets,  personal  rules  regarding  commercial  stop
orders and the uncapping of commission paid to agents are all  factors  that
affect the long-term viability of the insurance industry  as  a  whole.  The
South African market is not  large  enough  to  absorb  risks  such  as  the
collapse of a large corporation - Koeberg was mentioned -  or  of  a  mining
house. The importance of this  legislation  is  that  it  provides  for  the
participation of foreign insurers in the local insurance market.

In my introduction I said that the  role  of  investor  protection  in  this
particular piece of legislation cannot be negated. From 2000  to  2002,  the
long-term insurance ombudsman received something like 1 071  complaints,  of
which 85% were dealt with successfully. The short-term  insurance  ombudsman
received something like  433  complaints,  of  which  82%  were  dealt  with
successfully. Both the long-term and the short-term ombudsmen are funded  by
the industry as insurers and a fee is debited in respect of  each  complaint
received.

The New NP supports this Bill. I thank you.

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, the objective of  the
Insurance  Amendment  Bill  is  to  update  and  consolidate  the  insurance
industry's  legislative  framework  in  terms  of  internationally  accepted
principles and best practice. By amending this Bill today, we  are  ensuring
that we are in step with global events in this industry.

In South Africa, the insurance industry is a significant role-player. It  is
estimated that it contributes an average  of  2,5%  to  the  gross  domestic
product, or R17 billion annually. It employs more than  58 000  people.  The
market capitalisation of the industry  on  the  JSE  is  estimated  at  R128
billion. Currently there  are  a  total  of  155  short-term  and  long-term
insurers in South Africa - indeed a massive industry.

I want to highlight two  amendments  in  the  Bill:  firstly,  the  proposed
change  in  the  actuarial  method  of  calculating  the  value  of  assets,
liabilities and the capital adequacy requirement of all long-term  insurers.
This sets a minimum level at which  long-term  insurers  must  spread  their
assests.

Secondly, the Bill proposes that any  director  or  managing  executive  who
resigns or whose appointment has been terminated by an insurer  must  inform
the registrar in future, if so requested, of  any  matter  relating  to  the
affairs of that insurer which may prejudice the insurer's ability to  comply
with legislation. The recent allegations made by Mr Nic Frangos  about  poor
corporate governance at Corpcapital is a case in point.

The UDM supports the Insurance Amendment Bill. I thank you.

Mr L M GREEN: Thank you, Deputy  Speaker.  There  are  many  good  arguments
persuading the ACDP to support this Bill -  I  have  actually  prepared  two
pages of very good arguments - especially if you refer to clause  7  and  to
the issue that the hon  Ms  Hogan  mentioned,  but  unfortunately  I  cannot
articulate these arguments in one minute. All I can do is say that the  ACDP
supports this Bill and then sit down. [Interjections.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank  you,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  Life  insurance,  car
insurance, fidelity insurance, health care insurance,  litigatory  insurance
- and I am sure we can go on and on.  People  sign  up  for  these  and  the
killing premiums all  the  time,  but  how  common  it  is  to  find  people
complaining about the premiums and excesses they  are  paying  or  how  many
years they have been paying with minimum benefits - or how, on  signing  up,
they were under the impression that  the  insurance  would  cover  this  and
that, and it did not. Fine print is always there, but most  of  us  seem  to
fail to take time to read it.

The MF feels that in order to allow for fewer  people  to  feel  scammed  by
insurance, legislation should be put in place to control the  long-term  and
short-term insurance sphere. An insistence on clarity must be  stressed,  as
must the duty on those selling insurance to spell out  shortfalls  that  the
buyer may be faced with.

The MF notes that it is important for people, if they are able, to take  out
insurance for the various things that are valuable to them. But this  should
be done to your own benefit and to serve ... I can see the  light  flashing,
Deputy Speaker. Insurance must not be a monthly money drainage system  that,
though it collects a certain amount, attaches to  what  it  covers.  The  MF
supports the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr B A MNGUNI: Deputy Speaker, as the hon Green has said, this  Bill  has  a
lot to do with the protection of the clients.  For  instance,  in  terms  of
clause 4, when a company changes its name, say from  Sanlam  to  Santam,  it
has to go via the registrar so that it cannot confuse its clients when  they
make claims.

Also, when a director resigns from a company,  he  is  protected  or  immune
from prosecution if he gives information to  the  registrar  concerning  the
unethical behaviour of the company, because you might find that the  company
might act unethically in order to get money, or rather  to  refute  clients'
claims. So when a director or an  executive  resigns,  he  is  protected  by
clause 7 if he gives such information of unethical conduct to the  registrar
so that proper action can be taken.

It does happen sometimes, when you fill in  a  form,  that  you  forget,  or
perhaps you think the mistake was minor, or you might  think  that  you  are
healthy only to find after some time that,  according  to  the  insurer,  it
constitutes a risk. This Bill protects such a  person  so  that  if  perhaps
your age was underestimated or overestimated, the insurer  can't  say,  when
you go to claim, that because according  to  the  form  you  are  two  years
younger or two years older, therefore it won't be  able  to  pay  you.  This
clause protects you so that the insurer honours your claim.

Most of our people are low-income earners. Research that was done by WBS  on
global equity found that there are about six million people in South  Africa
that go to the banks or pay their premiums  through  debit  orders  or  stop
orders. Now this clause makes sure that even if  the  bank  does  not  print
your name or your policy number on the receipt, you are  protected,  because
banks have sophisticated infrastructures that can trace  the  premiums  that
you deposited with the insurer. So this Bill does protect you, even  if  the
insurance company might say  you  have  not  paid  your  premium.  When  you
produce that receipt or deposit slip from the bank, you  are  protected  and
the insurance company must honour your claim.

There are more good things about this Bill. As hon Green said,  he  couldn't
mention all of them. One of the things  is  that  the  insurance  companies,
these days, no longer need permission from the registrar  if  they  want  to
invest in the SADC countries. Previously they had  to  get  permission  from
the registrar to invest in other SADC countries. According to this Bill  now
they no longer have to ask for that permission.

I just want to say to the hon colleague  Wood  that  the  FSB  argument  was
refuted because when you borrow money, as the hon Comrade Barbara said,  the
interest cannot accumulate more than the capital you have borrowed. In  that
way it actually puts most of our people at a disadvantage.  There  were  six
reasons given by FSB which were refuted. That is why the  FSB  argument  was
refuted, because we saw  that  it  was  actually  unethical  really  to  let
someone borrow R50 000 and then, at the end of a year, to say, ``  You  must
now pay R150 000.'' That's why we opposed the in duplum route.

Lastly, the hon  Taljaard  says  there  were  strong-arm  tactics  when  the
minerals charter was drawn up. The fact is that  this  Government  will  not
hesitate to empower those who were denied opportunities  to  participate  in
the broader economic life of South Africa. Thank you. [Applause.]

Die MINISTER VAN FINANSIES: Mev die  Adjunkspeaker,  dit  is  die  week  van
veeltaligheid, so ek sal maar probeer om in Afrikaans net baie dankie te  sê
aan die komitee vir hul werk. Ek dink hul belangstelling in die belange  van
polishouers is uitstekend in hierdie  verband.  Dit  is  belangrik  dat  die
dinge waaroor lede hier gesels het, veral rakende  die  Raad  op  Finansiële
Dienste en hulle benadering, en die feit dat hulle gekorrigeer is  deur  die
komitee, vir ons sê dat demokrasie werk. Weer eens baie  dankie.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam Deputy Speaker, it is  multilingualism  week
so I will, in Afrikaans, try  just  to  say  thank  you  very  much  to  the
committee for their work. I think their concern for the interests of  policy
holders is excellent in this regard. It is important that the  things  which
members talk about here, especially regarding the Financial  Services  Board
and their approach, and the fact that they were rectified by the  committee,
tells us that democracy works. Once again thank you very much.  [Applause.]]


Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.

                          DIVISION OF REVENUE BILL

                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Mhlalingaphambili  [Madam  Speaker],  hon  members,
the Bill is the embodiment of co-operative governance, which is at the  very
heart of our  Constitution.  The  division  of  resources  among  the  three
spheres of Government is one of  the  most  critical  steps  in  the  Budget
process as it provides the basis for the  preparation  of  the  national,  9
provincial and 284 municipal budgets for the next financial year.

The  explanatory  attachments  also  contain  detailed  information  on  the
formula for the provincial and local  equitable  share  allocations,  and  a
detailed framework on each conditional grant to a province or  municipality.
The Bill therefore provides critical  information  for  every  province  and
municipality and for every national and  provincial  department  to  prepare
its budget.

I want to emphasise that this Bill deals with  aggregate  allocations  only,
and not how these funds are to be spent. The national  Government  allocates
its equitable share allocation through the  Appropriation  Bill.  This  Bill
therefore does not appropriate for the budgets  of  departments  or  sectors
and does not indicate  what  outputs  the  allocations  will  buy  and  what
outcomes would be accomplished. We  will  deal  with  these  in  a  separate
report, the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review, which should  be  available  in
roughly a month's time.

In respect of the allocations, the heart of this  Bill  is  in  Schedule  1,
which allocates funds to the  three  spheres  of  government.  Of  the  R334
billion budgeted  for  2003-04,  national  Government  is  allocated  R185,2
billion. This allocation includes R54 billion for debt-servicing  costs  and
the contingency reserve, leaving the national Government with  R138  billion
to allocate to its departments.

In respect of the provincial equitable share,  R142  billion  is  allocated,
and for local government the equitable share component is R6,3 billion.  The
total allocation for provinces,  including  both  the  equitable  share  and
conditional grants, increases from R137 billion this year  to  R159  billion
in 2003-04, rising to R192 billion in the  fiscal  year  which  ends  on  31
March 2006.

In respect of the provinces, the  Budget  maintains  strong  growth  in  the
allocations  targeted  for   provincial   infrastructure   development   and
maintenance, rising from R1,6 billion in  the  present  fiscal  year  to  R3
billion in the third year.  Provinces  will  receive  R8  billion  from  the
infrastructure grant over the period, an increase of about 25% per year.  It
is anticipated that provinces will use this grant effectively to  deal  with
infrastructure backlogs in schools, health facilities and provincial  roads.


However, it also strengthens Government's efforts  to  deal  with  pressures
arising from HIV/Aids  on  provincial  budgets.  Earmarked  allocations  for
HIV/Aids amount to R2,1 billion over the period. In addition, provinces  are
also expected to allocate at least R1 billion more in this year's MTEF  from
their budgets towards HIV/Aids programmes  for  prevention  and  support  to
those infected and affected.

In respect of local government, the 2003 budget is mainly  targeted  towards
the provision of free basic services, the extension  of  services  to  areas
not currently serviced and job creation through investment  in  labour-based
infrastructure programmes. In total R4,1 billion over the 2003 MTEF is  made
available for water, electricity, refuse removal and sanitation as  part  of
the Government commitment to providing free basic services.

Let me conclude by noting that it is now six years  since  the  introduction
of the current fiscal framework for provincial and local  governments.  Much
has happened since the creation of our nine  provinces  and  municipalities,
including the passage of foundation-laying  legislation,  the  establishment
of co-operative governance institutions such as the Budget  Council,  Budget
forums and Minmecs.

If one looks at what we have made available in this Bill, it is  very  clear
that the accompanying information goes far  beyond  the  legal  requirements
set out in the Constitution and  other  relevant  statutes.  The  additional
information provided with the Bill represents for us  another  milestone  in
enhancing political oversight and transparency and ensuring  accountability.
More  importantly,  the  allocation  of  all  local  government  grants  per
municipality  further  deepens  co-operative  governance   in   the   budget
allocation process. The announcement was made last week, four  months  ahead
of the due date for local government budgets.

I have pleasure in placing the Division of Revenue Bill before  this  House.
I also want to take this opportunity  to  wish  Shahid  Khan  a  very  happy
birthday. [Applause.]

Mr N M NENE: Madam Deputy Speaker and hon members, the Bill before us  today
fulfils a fundamental constitutional  requirement,  namely  section  214(1),
which directs that an annual Act of Parliament must determine the  equitable
division  of  nationally  raised  revenue  among  the   three   spheres   of
government. This is also  done  in  accordance  with  the  Intergovernmental
Fiscal Relations Act, Act 97 of 1997, which establishes forums and  outlines
various consultation processes that precede the tabling of this Bill.

The Freedom Charter visualises a standard of  living  for  our  people  that
would liberate them from poverty  and  want,  and  the  indignity  of  human
deprivation. It says: ``The people shall share in  the  country's  wealth'',
but unless  there  is  equitable  distribution  of  resources,  this  vision
remains but a dream.

Appropriately this Bill then  provides  for  the  following:  the  equitable
division of revenue anticipated to be raised  nationally,  among  all  three
spheres of government, for the 2003-04 financial year; the promotion of  co-
operative  governance  and  principles  of  intergovernmental  relations  on
budgetary matters; the promotion  of  better  co-ordination  between  policy
planning, budget preparation  and  execution  processes;  the  promotion  of
predictability and certainty in respect of  all  allocations  to  provincial
and local governments in order that such governments may plan their  budgets
over a multiyear period; the promotion of transparency  and  equity  in  all
allocations and of  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources  by
ensuring that all transfers are  reflected  on  the  budgets  of  benefiting
provincial and  local  governments;  and  ensuring  that  legal  proceedings
between organs of state and the three spheres of government are avoided.

Indeed, the tide has turned and there is no turning  back  in  the  struggle
against poverty. This Bill is the culmination of an exhaustive  consultative
process. In keeping with Government priorities, as outlined in  the  Medium-
Term Budget Policy Statement, the national departments receive 40,4% of  the
allocations, the provinces receive 56% and local  government  gets  3,6%.  I
will leave  out  the  bigger  figures,  because  the  Minister  has  already
mentioned them.

The shares of both provincial and local governments have been increasing  in
the past few years and they continue to increase significantly in  the  MTEF
period. The provincial allocation increases from 56% to  57,6%,  while  that
of local government increases from 3,6% to 4,4% in 2005-06. These  increases
take place at the cost of national  Government,  which  has  decreased  from
40,5% to 38%.

Section 214 of  the  Constitution  requires  that  the  annual  Division  of
Revenue Act be enacted only after account is taken of factors  such  as  the
national interest, provision of debt, the needs of national  Government  and
emergencies, the allocation of resources to provide basic services and  meet
developmental needs, and the fiscal capacity and  efficiency  of  provincial
and  local  governments.  Of  particular  importance  is  the  reduction  of
economic disparities and the promotion of stability and predictability.

As regards the national  interest  and  the  division  of  resources,  these
governance goals benefit the nation as a whole. Of  primary  importance  are
policy objectives such as the reduction of inequality, unemployment,  crime,
poverty  and   vulnerability.   Looking   at   economic   disparities,   the
infrastructure grant and the equitable  share  formulae  are  redistributive
towards the poor  provinces  and  municipalities  because  of  economic  and
demographic disparities between and  within  provinces  and  municipalities.
Fiscal capacity and efficiency in provincial government have  been  improved
by the implementation of the Public  Finance  Management  Act.  The  pending
promulgation of the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management  Bill  is
expected to do the same in local government over the next five years.

This Bill is but  one  instance  of  the  abundant  evidence  that  the  ANC
Government is serious  about  service  delivery  that  will  push  back  the
frontiers of poverty and bring about a better life for  all.  I  invite  hon
members to take time to look at the figures of these  allocations  and  then
to  assist  in  ensuring  that  these  allocations  achieve  their   desired
objectives.

I trust that we will support this Bill as a demonstration of our  commitment
to pushing back the frontiers of poverty. [Applause.]

Ms R TALJAARD: Deputy  Chair,  colleagues  and  Minister,  the  Division  of
Revenue Bill seeks to allocate the funds identified in  the  Budget  to  the
three spheres of  government  and  seeks  to  respond,  in  accordance  with
section 214 of the Constitution, to the substantive recommendations made  by
the FFC. Among these recommendations, the FFC made a call for  a  review  of
the intergovernmental fiscal relations, as our experiences must  spark  more
efficiency gains and constant improvement. The DA echoes this  call  of  the
FFC.

In terms of the Division of Revenue Bill,  national  Government's  share  of
revenue in this Budget year declines from 40,4%  to  38,9%  in  2003-04  and
just 38,0% at the end of the  MTEF  period,  while  provincial  governments'
share increases from 56,8% to 57,6% at the  end  of  the  MTEF  period.  The
local government share of revenue increases from 3,6% in 2002-03 to 4,3%  in
2003-04 and then remains relatively static over the MTEF period.

The Division of Revenue Bill is largely  a  replica  of  the  2002  version.
However, there are three new substantive provisions. There is a  new  clause
5 dealing with the equitable  share  allocations  to  local  government.  It
contains potentially contentious provisions on the stopping  of  funds  from
the National Treasury to local government.  These  provisions  pre-empt  the
current discussions on the Local Government:  Municipal  Finance  Management
Bill.

Secondly, there is a new clause 8 on transfers to national public  entities,
such as Eskom and water boards, performing municipal service functions.  The
provision requires such entities  to  formally  be  deemed  to  be  external
mechanisms for purposes of provisions of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
Systems Act. These entities will therefore  be  more  accountable  to  local
government  in  accordance  with  the  reporting  requirements  for   public
entities and external mechanisms in the systems  Act  as  well  as  the  new
clause 8. This provision is obviously welcomed.

The new clauses 15 and 17 obligate provinces  to  publish  local  government
grants per municipalities,  a  further  step  that  will  enhance  increased
transparency and therefore the abilities to exercise oversight  and  enhance
accountability.

The most problematic provision of this Bill for the DA, however,  is  clause
5. It presents a number of difficulties. It pre-empts key provisions of  the
Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill  and  deals  with  the
stopping of funds to a municipality where  that  municipality  seriously  or
persistently breaches uniform treasury norms and standards. As  the  process
around the Local Government: Municipal Finance Management Bill still has  to
resolve the question of the reach of what could be construed  as  a  uniform
treasury norm  and  standard,  and  this  question  has  obvious  and  clear
constitutional implications,  the  DA  does  not  believe  it  to  be  sound
legislative practice to pre-empt the  Local  Government:  Municipal  Finance
Management Bill with the new clause 5 in the Bill before  the  House  today.
This forms part of a different legislative deliberative process.  While  one
can  understand  and,  to  an  extent  perhaps,  sympathise  with   National
Treasury's slight impatience, this is bad legislative practice.

It is clear that one would have to weigh this provision against the  support
for the Division of Revenue Bill. Obviously we cannot  oppose  the  Division
of Revenue Bill purely and solely because of clause 5 and we  will  not.  We
support the Division of Revenue Bill. We do, however,  believe  that  it  is
bad legislative practice and it must not be repeated. The only saving  grace
is that this provision is only in force  for  one  year  and  will,  indeed,
hopefully be undercut by the subsequent enactment of the  Local  Government:
Municipal Finance Management Bill.

As the new Bill has taken - and I must compliment the National Treasury -  a
quantum leap in transparency and the quality  of  information  provided  and
contained in its annexures, the oversight challenge now rests with the  NCOP
and the Select Committee  on  Finance  for  a  more  in-depth  analysis  and
comments on Treasury's comments on the FFC recommendation and,  indeed,  the
adequacy of the equitable share allocations and grants.

Minister, I echo your sentiments to Mr Khan,  particularly  given  the  fact
that he survived a hijacking attempt this weekend. We  would  also  like  to
wish him a happy birthday. [Applause.]

Dr G G WOODS: Chairperson, the hon Nene and the hon  Taljaard  have  done  a
great job of covering all the more important issues, and I think  that  just
leaves me to make a few incidental observations. The  first  might  be  that
one notes over the years that the Bill is growing in scope. It seems  to  be
going way beyond its constitutional requirement of just  talking  about  the
equitable division of nationally raised revenue and  any  other  allocations
to the second and third tiers of government. It is now going on  to  show  a
tendency  to  get  into   areas   of   financial   management,   governance,
administration and distribution  methods  and  even  objects,  and  it  goes
beyond the objectives of the Bill as well.

Where these peripheral provisions  concern  accountability  arrangements,  I
think there is a case for their inclusion, but for the rest I  am  wondering
if these would not be better accommodated elsewhere in law.

Another issue,  to  repeat  one  mentioned  by  the  hon  Taljaard,  is  the
accompanying Annexure E.  I  think  in  previous  years  the  committee  had
requested that this annexure  indeed  accompany  the  Bill  as  required  in
section 10 of the Intergovernmental Fiscal  Relations  Act,  as  opposed  to
only appearing in the Treasury's Budget Review document. This year, for  the
first time, the  Treasury  obliged,  and  I  could  not  help  noticing  how
convenient this was for members of the committee when processing  the  Bill.
Thanks to the Treasury for that.

Regarding the actual divisions, I think my party has  done  the  obvious  by
looking at the KwaZulu-Natal  province's  division  and  the  basis  of  its
calculation. Here we are happy to report that  we  are  satisfied  with  the
participatory  and  transparent  nature  of  the  process  followed  in  the
establishment of the horizontal formulation, and we concur that the KwaZulu-
Natal province, the most populated province, will, in our  opinion,  receive
an equitable share of nationally collected revenues.

We do, however, have a small issue to resolve regarding the welfare  portion
of the KwaZulu-Natal allocation, where demographic features peculiar to  the
province and the effects of the welfare component,  which  is  part  general
allocation and part conditional grant, seem to leave the  province,  in  our
opinion, a little short-changed, but I believe the MEC of  the  province  is
taking that up with the Minister.

A final observation perhaps might be  to  express  a  few  thoughts  on  the
Financial and Fiscal  Commission,  FFC,  and  its  essential  constitutional
responsibilities, which concern it exercising its mind on the  divisions  of
revenue. To me it seems that the FFC has now developed into a body which  is
in  command  of  its  subject  matter  and,  through  various  research  and
analytical exercises, is demonstrating an ability to  undertake  work  of  a
high and relevant quality and, as it would seem,  work  that  is  now  being
considered by the  National  Treasury.  But  notwithstanding  this  apparent
progress on the part of the FFC, I, for one, have  never  fully  appreciated
the need for the FFC, especially as the Constitution gives it  no  decision-
making authority, only an advisory authority, and it is therefore of  little
effect should Treasury disregard it.

I would go further to say that the commission does not seem to  do  anything
that the National Treasury is not capable  of  doing,  and  I  suspect  that
there are those in the National Treasury who would silently  agree  with  me
on this issue.

The IFP supports the Division  of  Revenue  Bill  and  thanks  the  National
Treasury for the sound and thoughtful work that is put into its  compilation
and also for the high quality of the schedules that accompany the Bill.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Minister  of  Finance,  you  might
see that the gallery is filling up.  I  think  the  young  people  of  South
Africa want to see how the Minister of  Finance  and  this  Parliament  look
after  their  scarce  resources.  [Interjections.]  [Applause.]  Welcome  to
Parliament.

Dr P J RABIE: Deputy Chairman, hon Minister and hon  members,  the  Division
of Revenue Bill provides  for  the  equitable  division  of  revenue  raised
nationally among the national, provincial and local spheres  of  government.
The reporting requirements of allocations and the permission  regarding  the
withholding and delaying of  payments  in  certain  circumstances  are  also
clearly spelt out.

This Bill is the product of a consultative process, with the  Financial  and
Fiscal Commission, in terms of the Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework,  and
other  bodies  assessing  developmental  needs.   A   number   of   economic
disparities are identified  and  the  needs  regarding  schools,  hospitals,
clinics and housing are clearly mentioned.

Flexibility regarding contingency funds in case  of  emergencies  through  a
contingency  reserve  that  provides  a  cushion   for   unforeseeable   and
unavoidable expenditure is also provided for. Sections  16  and  25  of  the
Public Finance Management Act make specific provision for the allocation  of
these specific funds.

I think it is important for hon members  to  acquaint  themselves  with  the
equitable share formula used to allocate funds - which is,  after  all,  the
essence of this particular piece of  legislation  -  to  provinces  and  the
components or indices used, namely, education, health,  welfare,  population
and economic  and  institutional  output.  The  equitable  share  for  local
government  is  also  clearly  spelt  out.  Appendix  E2  provides  a  brief
description of conditional grants to local government. The  significance  of
these  grants,  the  conditions,  criteria  for  allocation,  rationale  for
funding,  monitoring  mechanisms,  projected  life  of  the  grant  and  the
capacity  and  preparedness  of  the  transferring   department   are   also
mentioned.

Statistical data taken from the 2001 census are  widely  used.  Appendix  E4
shows infrastructure grants  to  municipalities  and  Appendix  E5  indirect
grants to municipalities.

To conclude, Appendix E7 is important because it shows the demographic  data
and local government equitable share regarding the population  in  a  number
of urban and nonurban local authorities.

Before  I  conclude,  allow  me  also   to   congratulate   Mr   Khan,   the
representative of Treasury to the Portfolio  Committee  on  Finance.  He  is
celebrating his birthday. Many happy returns and thank you for the  sterling
work that you are doing.

The New NP supports the Bill. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon members, Ms Bogopane, who  is  the
chairperson of the Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of  Quality  of
Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled  Persons,  has  given  me  a
note. The people who are in the gallery are the  girls  from  the  different
provinces - I think it is 20 per  province  -  who  will  be  attending  the
Girls' Education Movement launch on 7 March, tomorrow, in the  Old  Assembly
Chamber, Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. They  go  by  the  very
interesting short title of GEM, which  is  the  Girls'  Education  Movement.
[Applause.]

To all of you young people, you are indeed very welcome. This Parliament  is
committed to ensuring that young people, and girls in particular, are  given
every opportunity to develop to their fullest extent and  to  their  fullest
potential in this country. Welcome to our Parliament. [Applause.]

Dr G W KOORNHOF: Mr Deputy Chair and hon  members,  despite  the  fact  that
this House has no powers to amend the Division of Revenue Bill,  it  remains
an important money Bill because it provides for the  equitable  division  of
revenue raised nationally among the national, provincial and  local  spheres
of government for the 2003-04 financial year.
Due to time constraints I will only concentrate on local  government,  which
represents the sphere closest to service delivery. The Financial and  Fiscal
Commission, the FFC, in its submission on this Bill, states the following:


  A growing concern for the intergovernmental fiscal system is the increase
  in municipal deficits over the last three years.  It  would  appear  that
  further increases are expected for the next two years.

It is estimated that municipalities are owed a staggering R22,5 billion  for
rates and service charges as at 31 March 2002. The role envisaged for  local
government to provide  services  is  being  seriously  compromised  by  this
consumer debt crisis. We urgently need steps at both national and  municipal
levels to prevent further consumer debt escalation.

Regarding the equitable share for local government, we therefore agree  with
the provision that National Treasury may delay or withhold the  transfer  of
an instalment in certain  circumstances.  Furthermore,  municipalities  that
are  not  able  to  effectively  administer  an  allocation  will  see  such
allocations transferred to the  province  or  to  another  municipality.  We
simply cannot afford to throw money down a bottomless pit any more,  and  we
support this provision that the Minister has put in.

In conclusion may we also wish Mr Shahid Khan a very happy birthday.  He  is
a valued member of Team Finance, but he is also a very good  friend  of  the
Portfolio Committee on Finance. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I think the Chair might as  well  join
all  the  members  in  wishing  Mr  Shahid  Khan  a  very  happy   birthday.
[Applause.]

Mr L  M  GREEN:  Deputy  Chairperson,  this  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  is
substantial. It consists of 185 pages,  and  therefore  I  think  we  should
actually be quite serious when we debate  it.  To  allocate  40  minutes  to
debate this Bill is not acceptable, because  you  have  to  comment  on  the
equitable share for local government and on so many other  things,  and  yet
you are given one single minute to do  that.  [Interjections.]  We  are  not
serious  when  it   comes   to   democracy   and   to   democratic   debate.
[Interjections.] How can one debate ... [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Green, will you  take  your
seat. [Interjections.] Hon Green, I am addressing  you.  There  are  avenues
open in this House to deal with the type of  matter  that  you  want  to  be
brought forward and that would be by way of a substantive motion.

I think that in respect of the Bill, the convention is that  you  will  have
to confine yourself to what is in the Bill. So if you would please do that.

Mr L M GREEN: Chairperson, the ACDP doesn't have any time to comment on  the
Bill. There is nothing we can say. Let me just conclude  by  wishing  Shahid
Khan a happy birthday. That is about all we can say. We can't  debate  this.
It's ridiculous. [Interjections.]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Thank you, Chairperson.  Shahid,  happy  birthday.  I  want
some birthday cake.

Deputy Chair, it's again that time of the year when we all eagerly  wait  to
know the Budget funding allotted to the various sectors that are to put  our
aims into action.

The Division of Revenue Bill  is  especially  important  in  that  it  is  a
sharing  of  revenue  between  the  three  spheres  of  government,   namely
national, provincial and  local.  Further,  the  division  within  these  is
extremely important and the MF understands the pressure and brain-strain  it
must take to attain equitable estimates.

KwaZulu-Natal is the most  densely  populated  province.  With  more  people
there, there are more needs, and  more  needs  spell  more  challenges.  The
province is also estimated to be the zone worst affected by HIV. This  poses
one of  the  greatest  challenges,  not  forgetting  housing,  other  health
issues, education, social  services,  the  Public  Service  and  many  other
portfolios that fulfil basic human survival needs.

The estimated budget allotted to the KwaZulu-Natal province is  welcomed  by
the MF, which supports the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr F C FANKOMO: Deputy Chairperson, hon members, it  gives  me  pleasure  to
thank you all here. Mr Green has given me the chance  of  an  extra  minute,
and therefore I should have seven minutes.
According  to  section  214  of  the  Constitution,  it  is  required   that
Parliament  should  enact  the  equitable   division   of   revenue   raised
nationally. This is to be done through provincial and  local  government.  I
will concentrate only  on  the  equitable  share  that  is  given  to  local
government.

In support of the Constitution, section 10 of the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Relations Act of 1997 requires that when the Minister of Finance  introduces
the annual Budget each year, he must introduce a Division  of  Revenue  Bill
which relates to the current Budget. The Bill under review is introduced  in
compliance   with   the   requirements   of   the   Constitution   and   the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Act.

The Bill seeks to  enhance  transparency  and  certainty  in  the  municipal
transfers and budgets. The  previous  Division  of  Revenue  Act  introduced
reforms of the intergovernmental fiscal transfer system which have  improved
functioning.

The  current  Division  of  Revenue  Bill  introduces  amendments  to  those
sections that affect local government  allocation.  For  example,  the  Bill
provides for the allocation of  a  local  government  equitable  share  that
allows, for the  first  time,  for  the  publication  of  the  division  per
municipality when  the  annual  Budget  is  tabled.  It  also  provides  for
delaying the equitable shares to municipalities  if  they  fail  to  provide
basic information. The purpose of this is to ensure that the  municipalities
do provide basic information indicating how the provision of basic  services
is catered for. This Bill also requires the provision of public  information
on  the  municipality's  own  allocations  by  tabling  their  budgets   and
recognising the service authority role of municipalities.

Currently, the provincial share transfers for  Limpopo  amount  to  R728 890
with a projection of R842 370 for the next year. One of its  districts  will
have to receive an amount of R101 322 with a projection of R115  104,  which
means that one of its municipalities, Bushbuckridge, receives an  amount  of
R56 520 with a projection of R56 858 for the coming year.  This  shows  that
the ANC-led Government seeks to push back the frontiers of  poverty  in  our
society through political mechanisms  and  legislative  procedures  such  as
this one.

Municipalities take responsibility for the delivery  of  services  in  their
jurisdictions. This means that all grants provided to public  entities  such
as Eskom and water boards  for  the  provinces  should  be  negotiated  with
municipalities. Municipalities are assisted by the national Government  with
unconditional grants to supplement their  revenue  to  deliver  services  to
poor households.

The criteria used for the provision of the equitable  share  were  developed
at a time when  there  was  no  information  regarding  population,  income,
demographics, fiscal capacity and backlogs. Budget and  costing  information
was  not  available.  Hence  this  legislation  attempts  to  implement  the
equitable share referred to in section 227  of  the  Constitution.  I  thank
you. [Applause.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  I  don't  know  why  the
Girls' Education Movement ran away, but I didn't mean to scare them.

Let me express appreciation. I'm really sorry that the hon  Green  feels  so
strongly about the issue of time. But I saw the hon Rajbally, with the  same
amount of time, make a profound input about the constituency she  represents
and the impact of this Bill on her life and the lives of people around  her.
It's just a pity that he chose to argue as he did.

In respect of the points by the hon Woods on the FFC, I think  that  all  of
the Chapter 9 institutions are like that. I take the view that  the  FFC  is
an umbrella, and because the sun is shining  you  don't  want  to  sell  the
umbrella. So it's there. It will have an important role to  fulfil  at  some
time. I think for as long as it  is  there  to  maintain  the  interests  of
people within the FFC, it's  important  that  we  construct  a  relationship
that's positive and constructive for them.

In their inputs they took a particular  view  on  the  contingency  reserve.
It's one that I happen to disagree with, but it's an indication of the  fact
that they are there and trying.

I would like to address the issues that the hon Taljaard raised  in  respect
of section 5(6) in particular. She says that this is an attempt to  pre-empt
the Local Government: Municipal  Finance  Management  Bill.  The  origin  of
section 5(6) is in the Constitution in section 216(2), which is a  precursor
also to how we style our relations with the provinces. It says:


  The  national  treasury  must  enforce  compliance  with   the   measures
  established in terms of subsection (1), and  may  stop  the  transfer  of
  funds to an organ of state if that organ of state commits  a  serious  or
  persistent material breach of those measures.

So it's not about the Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill.
It's about the Constitution and constructing a basis  for  constitutionality
in the Division of Revenue Bill. Clearly, it's there as  a  measure  to  try
and strengthen, because the risk in  respect  of  local  government  is  the
moral hazard problem. We  have  now  published  early  the  equitable  share
allocations to each local authority. Now we've got to see how this is  used.
We've indicated in consultation with them that there has to be  a  focus  on
the provision of free basic services.

So the basis for consultation is there, but the enduring problem in  respect
of local government is the debt. It's a situation that has impacted,  as  we
all know, on the relations between municipal  government  and  the  Auditor-
General. But if we merely make good without  requiring  certain  steps  from
local government, then we'll fail,  I  think,  democracy  in  this  country,
because very importantly, what local government  needs  is  to  implement  a
policy on indigence.

It has to be a policy where people  volunteer  their  circumstances  to  the
local government where their circumstances can be measured. They  should  be
put on a register and you can then separate debt which is bad debt,  because
it can't be paid by people who are just too poor to pay, from  the  debt  of
those people who actually ought to be paying and where  there  needs  to  be
much stronger enforcement.

That's part of the discourse between ourselves and local government. It's  a
very important part of this, and so the  provisions  in  section  5(6)  also
have that at the back of  the  mind.  Clearly,  the  passage  of  the  Local
Government: Municipal Finance Bill will assist in  this  regard  because  it
will order the way in which local authorities budget  and  report  on  their
money.

Again, chairperson, hon members,  thank  you  very  much  for  the  support.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill read a second time.
