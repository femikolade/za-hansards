          ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES REQUIRED FOR ALLEVIATION OF POVERTY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Thank you, Chairperson. I rise to move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) takes cognisance of  the  2000  United  Nations  Millennium  Summit's
       resolution that poverty in the world must be halved by the year 2015;
       and


  (2) expresses its concern that Africa south of the Sahara might not reach
       that target unless it reaches economic growth rates of between 7  and
       8 percent per annum.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                    INCREASED RELIANCE ON PORT FACILITIES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Thank you, Mr Chairperson. I move without notice:


  That the Council-


  (1) notes that South Africa relies heavily on its ports for the  movement
       of exports and imports, as the country's geographic location dictates
       that most goods move by sea;


  (2) is aware that there has been  a  phenomenal  growth  in  exports  and
       imports by value and tonnage since 1994, placing pressure on all  our
       ports, but especially on the container  terminals,  where  there  are
       many delays resulting, inter alia, in a loss of investment confidence
       and of income and in additional storage  expenditure  for  exporters;
       and


  (3) urgently requests the Minister of Public  Enterprises  to  facilitate
       the expansion of the port facilities,  especially  at  the  container
       terminals and address the shortcomings with regard to operations  and
       staff across all of the country's ports.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES - PERSONNEL BACKLOG

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note that -


       (a)  the Department of Correctional Services at present has a backlog
           of 5 402 personnel on its posts establishment;


       (b)  the majority of these positions are on the entry level but  that
           there are also shortages on promotional and senior levels;


       (c)  the cost to fund these shortages is estimated  at  approximately
           R534 million; and


       (d)  at this stage it is foreseen by  the  Minister  of  Correctional
           Services that, instead of decreasing, the shortage of  personnel
           will increase to 7 821 in the 2005/2006 financial year; and


  (2) in the light of the overcrowding crisis in our prisons, which are  at
       present  overpopulated  by  78  874  or  71,1%,  with  the  resultant
       extremely negative effect thereof on the rehabilitation of  prisoners
       and the fight against crime, requests The Presidency, the Minister of
       Finance and the Minister of Correctional Services  to  urgently  give
       attention to this problem and requests the Minister  of  Correctional
       Services to report to the Council within  three  months  on  progress
       regarding this matter.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                                ASCENSION DAY

  Verlosser leef en opgevaar het na die hemel.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That  the  Council  notes  that  Christians  worldwide  are   celebrating
  Ascension Day today which, together with the birth, the  crucifixion  and

                               (Policy debate)

Vote No 33 - Transport:

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Before I call the first  speaker,  may
I say I am very happy to see Minister Dullah Omar  with  us  in  the  House.
[Applause.]

Members would have noticed that our Minister took ill some time  back.  That
is why I'm saying we are happy to see him in the House.  On  behalf  of  the
Presiding Officers of the NCOP and on behalf of the members of the  Council,
I wish you a speedy recovery, hon Minister, and say to  you  thanks  to  the
Lord that He still gives you all the energy  and  power  to  be  within  our
midst. We really appreciate that. Thank you very much. [Applause.]
The ACTING MINISTER  OF  TRANSPORT  (Mr  J  Radebe):  Hon  Chairperson,  hon
members of the NCOP and Minister Dullah  Omar,  I  also  want  to  join  the
Chairperson and hon members  in  wishing  our  Cabinet  colleague  a  speedy
recovery.

Chairperson, as  we  continue  to  face  the  challenges  of  improving  our
transport system in general, we constantly remind ourselves of a  vision  we
set at the time of developing the  White  Paper  on  Transport  Policy.  Our
vision to provide safe, reliable, effective and fully  integrated  transport
operations and infrastructure is still as relevant today as it was in 1996.

On one hand, transport holds the key  to  economic  growth  in  the  country
because  without  the  means  and  capacity  to  move   people   and   goods
efficiently, we stand still as a nation. On the other hand, our social  role
is to provide for the transport needs  of  people  on  an  affordable  basis
whilst we also address the gross distortions inherited  from  the  apartheid
government.

Today, I will confine my input to three critical areas of our  work,  namely
road infrastructure, transport safety and public  transport.  Let  me  first
begin with the road infrastructure. I am pleased  to  confirm,  today,  that
Cabinet has approved a five-year road infrastructure  strategy,  which  will
prevent further deterioration of our road network.

Funds for the implementation of this strategy have  already  been  projected
for and are included in the current budget  allocations  under  the  Medium-
Term Expenditure Framework. A great deal of work needs to be done  over  the
next five years in rural community  roads,  routine  maintenance,  resealing
and  gravelling,  rehabilitation  and   overheads.   Provinces   and   local
authorities will need to identify priority projects. I will shortly  convene
a special Minmec to discuss fast-tracking the planning process.

The focus today will be on provincial road infrastructure service  delivery.
Provinces  face  serious  challenges  in  dealing   with   maintenance   and
rehabilitation backlogs. A balance has to be struck  between  the  provision
of resources for routine maintenance  of  the  existing  road  network,  the
rehabilitation of poor roads and  investment  in  the  construction  of  new
roads, to improve accessibility.

Allocation for construction and rehabilitation  of  roads  across  provinces
fluctuate.  However,  there  is  a  clear  increase   in   allocations   for
maintenance and there has been a marked turnaround  in  spending  on  roads,
particularly since the floods experience of 2001.

The recently completed Inter-Governmental Fiscal Review of 2003  shows  that
provinces account for  the  most  spending  on  roads,  and  the  provincial
budgets will increase by 7,5%, from R4,7 billion in 2002-03 to R5,1  billion
in 2003-04. They are also projected to increase further  by  9,5%  over  the
MTEF, reaching R6,2 billion in 2005-2006.

In 2002-03, the total provincial budget spending  on  the  constructing  and
upgrading of roads amounted  to  R2,2  billion  and,  following  a  budgeted
decline  in  spending  to  R1,9  billion  in  2003-04,  the  expenditure  is
projected to rise to R2,5 billion in 2005-06.

Provinces  have  had  varying  degrees  of  success  in  delivery.  The  key
constraint relates to the availability of funds.  For  example,  in  2002-03
Limpopo required R318 million to maintain its roads and to  prevent  further
damage, and R110 million was allocated in its budget,  leaving  a  shortfall
of R208 million. Western Cape indicated that only 14% of  regravelling,  45%
of resealing needs, 39% and 60% of the routine  maintenance  of  gravel  and
surface road network respectively could be met with the 2002-03 budget.

Notwithstanding these budgetary constraints, most  provinces  were  able  to
achieve  commendable  results  in  the  areas  of  new  road   construction,
maintenance and rehabilitation and development  of  community  access  roads
through labour-intensive construction  aimed  at  employment  creation.  The
implementation, for example, of  Zibambele  in  KwaZulu-Natal,  Zivuseni  in
Gauteng and Vukuzakhe in Eastern Cape, which are  labour-based  construction
programmes,  are  examples  of  key  successes   of   community-based   road
programmes.

In the context of the  integrated  sustainable  rural  development  and  the
urban renewal programmes, the department is  supporting  the  implementation
of projects in the following nodes:  Chris  Hani,  Ukhahlamba,  O  R  Tambo,
Alfred Nzo, Thabo  Mufutsanyana,  Ugu,  Umzinyathi,  Zululand,  Ukhanyukude,
Sekhukhune, Botshabelo, Kgalagadi and Central Karoo as  well  as  Ethekwini,
Galeshewe, Alexandra and Khayelitsha.

The  department  is  also  working  very  closely  with  the  Department  of
Provincial and Local Government in the process of consolidating the  various
municipal infrastructure grants, such  as  the  Urban  Transport  Fund,  the
Consolidated Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant,  the  Community-Based  Public
Works Programme and others into one municipal infrastructure grant.

Pilot projects in the  following  district  municipalities  are  under  way:
Sekhukhune, Botshabelo, Kgalagadi, Motheo, Thabo Mofutsanyana,  Alfred  Nzo,
O R Tambo, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan and Ethekwini.

Let me now highlight one of the key  challenges  we  are  facing  in  public
transport, which is that of the provision of passenger transport  subsidies.
As you  are  aware,  due  to  the  funding  constraints  related  to  public
transport  subsidies,  the  Department  of  Transport,  in  December   2001,
introduced  a  moratorium  on  the  further  implementation  of  competitive
tendering.

In December last year, Mincom decided that this moratorium should be  lifted
and  that  provinces  should,  without  any  further   delay,   pursue   the
implementation of  competitive  tendering.  In  order  to  facilitate  this,
Government is in the process of finalising the model tender document  to  be
published in terms of the National Land Transport Transition Act of 2000.

In the targeting of subsidies, mobility in South Africa cannot  be  isolated
from the history of the country and the detrimental effect  that  segregated
planning has had on the travelling patterns of the majority  of  the  people
of this country and, eventually, on the availability of public transport.

The House may recall that due to the  ever-increasing  needs  for  passenger
transport subsidies, an investigation  was  concluded  towards  the  end  of
2002, which focused on  passenger  profiles  and  the  targeting  of  public
transport subsidies. Targeting of subsidies is,  however,  a  complex  issue
and there are various  international  best-practice  models.  The  challenge
that we are facing is to develop a model  that  serves  Government's  social
and economic imperatives as well as the interest of the public in general.

Now I turn to minibus taxis. In the light  of  recent  media  statements,  I
would like to assure the House that Government  is  ever  committed  to  the
recapitalisation programme and we'll do everything in our power  to  address
the differences that exist between Government and the taxi industry.

Although the tender for the new taxi vehicles  and  the  related  electronic
management  system,  the  EMS,  is  mainly  driven  by  the  Departments  of
Transport and Trade and Industry, provinces have a key role to play  in  the
rollout of the programme. For example, provinces have been and  continue  to
be responsible for the implementation of the  key  components  of  the  taxi
recap programme, such as the Be Legal Campaign,  registration  with  the  SA
Revenue Service, conversion from taxi  permits  to  operating  licences,  to
mention but a few of  the  responsibilities.  We  are  embarking  upon  this
process in time in order to ensure maximum  participation  of  operators  in
the taxi recapitalisation programme.

Due to the complexity of the processes required for the rollout of the  taxi
recap programme, there are many challenges still to be  addressed.  Measures
have already been taken to facilitate the  identification  of  gaps  in  the
process, recommending measures to address those gaps and  further  assisting
in monitoring the rollout of the programme.

On the commuter rail, the extension of the Khayelitsha  commuter  rail  line
has been on the cards for the last 20 years. This project has now  become  a
reality and I'm pleased to inform the House that the department has  managed
to secure R140 million for the project. These funds should  be  adequate  in
order to proceed  with  the  actual  construction  of  the  rail  line,  the
provision of the rail infrastructure and the refurbishment  of  the  rolling
stock that will be required once the extension has  been  completed.  It  is
expected that the construction of the rail extension will  be  completed  by
the end of December 2005.

I'm pleased, also, to inform this House of the progress that has  been  made
with the upgrading of  the  Mabopane  station.  Last  year,  the  House  was
informed that an amount of R15 million was set aside for  the  redevelopment
of  this  particular  station.  Substantial  progress  has  been  made.  The
precinct development plan  and  master  plan  for  this  station  have  been
completed.
Currently,  contractors  have  been  appointed,  mainly   from   the   local
community, to undertake  rehabilitation  of  services  such  as  storm-water
systems, water reticulation and electricity. The  physical  construction  of
the project will be officially launched on 2 June, a few days from now.

On railway  safety,  we  are  committed  towards  ensuring  the  safety  and
security  of  passengers  and  goods  on  the  railway   transport   system,
addressing railway occurrences as well as the security  of  all  passengers.
I'm pleased to report that we'll soon announce the names  on  the  board  of
directors for the newly established railway  safety  regulator,  which  will
regulate safety by setting standards in the railway transport system.

A lot of work has been done in laying the foundation for the new  regulatory
body  and  clear  regulations  and  standards   have   been   developed   in
consultation with the SA Bureau of Standards, the Department of  Labour  and
other stakeholders in the industry.

Over the past year  the  National  Department  of  Transport,  the  SA  Rail
Commuter Services and Metrorail have begun  to  develop  a  new  two-pronged
strategy of safety and security for the rail  commuter  system.  The  safety
and security strategy has been deployed as a pilot  project  in  the  entire
Western Cape  metropolitan  rail  network  since  October  2002,  with  very
positive results.

The outcome of this project will define the operational  infrastructure  and
facility adequacy gaps  in  both  financial  and  physical  terms  and  will
determine whether the  current  investment  profile  of  the  commuter  rail
system is to be realigned. I will inform the House of  the  outcome  of  the
study as soon as the project is completed.

One of  the  fundamental  issues  that  cuts  across  public  transport  and
infrastructure development is that of transport  planning.  The  rollout  of
the first phase of transport planning was embarked upon  nationally  in  the
2002-03 financial year.

In order to address the transport planning  capacity  limitations  at  local
and provincial spheres, the department is embarking on a training  programme
that will be rolled out in all the provinces around October this year.  With
regard to funding, an amount of R3 million was transferred to  each  of  the
provinces in the two previous financial years and a further R2  million  has
already been transferred in the current financial year.

As  in  the  past,  the  Department  of  Transport  also  focused   on   the
developmental  nodes.  Firstly,  with  regard  to  urban  renewal,  we   are
currently involved directly with three of the identified  urban  nodes,  and
delivery of public transport  infrastructure  is  the  focus  in  Alexandra,
Inanda,  Kwamashu  and  Khayelitsha.  In  Alexandra,  a   public   transport
interchange is to be developed together with the city  of  Johannesburg  and
it will be completed in the current financial year.

Various upgrading and provision of safe access to taxi  facilities  will  be
embarked upon in the Inanda-Kwamashu node. Considering the need  to  promote
non-motorised transport, the department is also working  very  closely  with
the Sol Plaatjie municipality in the Northern Cape, to  extend  the  bicycle
paths in that area.

With regard to rural  transport,  the  department  has  conducted  strategic
transport  audits  in  all  13  of  the  integrated  and  sustainable  rural
development nodes, the findings of which will inform concrete  actions  that
the department will facilitate through  pilot  projects.  In  addition,  the
department's newly  established  infrastructure  unit  has  prioritised  the
development  of  rural  access  infrastructure   as   part   of   its   road
infrastructure strategic framework.

The issue of road safety continues to  receive  priority  attention  in  the
department. I need not repeat the daily tragic loss of lives on  our  roads.
The statistics that are continuously released by the  department  speak  for
themselves and we cannot allow this scourge to continue at  current  levels,
as it is every South African's right to travel safely on our roads.

The department, in collaboration with provinces  and  local  government,  is
hard at work to turn around the current situation. We have  assessed  issues
that require urgent attention and, through a consultative process  involving
various roleplayers  and  input  provided  by  the  various  provinces,  the
following  key  interventions  have  been  identified  for  development  and
implementation in the short to medium term: Integrated law  enforcement  and
communication, which  involves  the  development  and  implementation  of  a
coordinated plan for traffic law enforcement and support services.

This seeks to eliminate fragmentation in law enforcement and  the  promotion
of a cooperative, uniform and focused approach towards  the  undertaking  of
law enforcement across provincial boundaries. Conducting  a  forensic  audit
into road traffic accident statistics, leading to the establishment  of  the
national road traffic accident bureau.

The current fragmented responsibilities across  many  authorities,  together
with insufficient resources, have led to a  dramatic  deterioration  of  the
quality of formal accident  information  over  the  last  three  years.  The
objective of the project is to undertake a complete  and  detailed  forensic
investigation into the current system  of  recording,  capturing,  analysing
and transferring of accident information, and to this end a reliable  system
is being developed and will soon be implemented.

Hazardous locations were identified in  provinces  and  there  is  currently
ongoing work to improve safety in  those  locations.  For  example,  notable
improvements have been made in four locations  in  Gauteng,  five  in  North
West and ten in the  Western  Cape.  Furthermore,  a  pedestrian  visibility
project has been set  up  in  order  to  improve  visibility  of  vulnerable
pedestrians in and around high-risk and accident-prone areas.

Establishing  community-based  structures  that  will  coordinate,  educate,
create awareness  and  encourage  community  participation  in  road  safety
programmes and, lastly, amending the road traffic legislation  in  order  to
give effect to some of the principal strategies contained  in  the  Road  to
Safety Strategy.

All of the above, all these interventions, are aimed at the  elimination  of
fragmentation between the various authorities and  improve  coordination  of
efforts amongst functional areas in road traffic, the  optimisation  of  the
utilisation  of  scarce  resources,  introduction  of  the  use  of   modern
technology as well as enhanced  implementation  of  some  of  the  aims  and
objectives of the Road to Safety Strategy 2001-2005.

In conclusion, I wish to restate that transport plays  a  critical  role  in
addressing social needs and contributing  towards  growth  in  the  economy.
More than any other sector, the  transport  sector  is  divided  into  three
spheres of Government and, as  a  result,  requires  the  highest  level  of
cooperation. This cooperation  is  particularly  critical  for  the  current
implementation of infrastructure projects, road safety interventions and  in
the public transport provision.

These, therefore, compel all of us to share a common planning vision, and  I
want to thank the NCOP  as  well  as  my  provincial  colleagues  for  their
continuous support and contribution in shaping this vision as  well  as  the
achievement of the objectives that we have  set.  We  are  still  faced,  of
course, with massive challenges ahead and we look forward to your  continued
support as  we  address  the  challenges  in  the  days  ahead.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon  Minister.  Can  I  ask
the members to close their cellphones, please?  Please  check  whether  your
cellphone is closed, before I proceed. I want to make sure. If you have  got
your cellphone on, just close it.

Mr V V Z WINDVOЁL: Thank you, Deputy Chairperson. Let me first confirm  that
my cellphone is closed. And, let me also say upfront that today  -  I'll  be
brief, Deputy Chairperson  -  it  was  with  great  shock  that,  as  acting
chairperson of our provincial ANC caucus of Mpumalanga, I got  the  news  of
the untimely passing away of Comrade  Ephraim  Mogale,  who  was  a  gallant
freedom fighter; one of the founders and also the first president of  Cosas,
the Congress of South African Students, which also played a  great  role  in
the liberation of this country.

Chairperson, let me also salute the good work that has been done by  Comrade
Dullah Omar, our hon Minister of Transport, who also played a  very  leading
role - and also suffered -  through  his  involvement  in  the  struggle  to
liberate his country. He played a very great role as  Minister  of  Justice,
which also saw the establishment of the TRC that played a  role  in  healing
the wounds of South Africa and contributed towards  reconciliation.  I  must
also, Chairperson, thank - as  the  acting  chairperson  -  the  hon  acting
Minister, Comrade Jeff Radebe, for his role and his commitment to assist  in
the department. I know, hon Minister, you are overloaded, but you'll not  be
issued a traffic fine, because that overload is for the good  cause  of  the
country. I must pledge the support of the committee in assisting you in  the
moving forward of your work.

Today, as we stand here,  transport  serves  as  an  effective  catalyst  of
change in South Africa; as an effective, integral part of pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty. Today we stand in our second term  of  our  democratic
mandate of delivering an integrated and  sustainable  system  of  transport,
and we stand tall with the successes we have made in the short way  we  have
travelled thus far.

Let  me  also   say,   Deputy   Chairperson,   that,   notwithstanding   the
international and continental role the Department of Transport  is  playing,
we are facing certain challenges which we have  to  overcome,  but  most  of
them will have to redress the imbalances of the past. And in  the  words  of
the former President, Comrade  Nelson  Mandela,  he  says  that  no  society
emerging from the  grand  disaster  of  the  apartheid  system  could  avoid
clearing the blemishes of its past. If we are able today  to  speak  proudly
of the rainbow nation, it is  partly  because  the  words  set  us  a  moral
example, which we dared to follow. And the first founding stone of  our  new
country is national reconciliation and national unity. The fact that it  has
settled its mortar needs no advertising. We do face  major  challenges,  but
none are as daunting as those we have already surmounted.

We must say that we are moving, bit by bit, to  overcome  those  challenges,
because as we speak today we have people  who  have  travelled  hundreds  of
kilometres from the KwaMhlanga, eNkangala area, going  to  their  workplaces
around Pretoria, where the Department of Transport is spending millions  and
millions to subsidise those people for their public transport to  go  there.
If it was not for the  racially  based  spacial  planning  of  the  previous
regime, we could be utilising those funds for other valuable exercises.

I must also say that as we are here today,  this  department  plays  a  very
significant role in the economic growth of the country. Hence, we  say  that
a good transport system  is  necessary  for  efficient  functioning  of  the
economy. It creates  economic  opportunities  and  facilitates  movement  of
people, resources and output to industries and markets, and  enables  people
to  access  social  services.  We  must  say  that  the  labour-based   road
construction and maintenance programmes give a lot of job  opportunities  to
our people. It plays  a  very  significant  role  in  developing,  and  also
assisting to empower, our black people in a way  that  most  of  the  SMMEs,
which are  involved  in  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  our  roads
throughout the country, are now  becoming  economically  more  viable,  thus
creating a lot of job opportunities.

Chairperson, may I just reflect a bit on the taxi  recapitalisation,  which,
as a committee, we must say that we feel that  we  need  to  put  some  more
acceleration towards a conclusion of this  noble  programme.  We  are  aware
that it has taken some time, we are aware that there  have  been  challenges
where there was some resistance from some quarters  of  the  taxi  industry.
But, we know that the department is doing all it can in its efforts  to  see
the realisation of this programme taking place. I must  also  condemn  those
taxi drivers who don't take care for the lives of the commuters.

We are of the view that as  much  as  we  have  the  demeriting  points  for
ordinary driver's licences - where we accumulate  points  in  terms  of  how
many traffic offences one has committed, leading to a situation where  one's
licence can be suspended, or even cancelled - we are saying  the  department
should look into a situation where in the  PDPs,  the  professional  driving
permits, we  could  also  have  points  demerited  so  that  those  reckless
drivers, like those who are found playing this game called chicken  -  which
also led to the death of 13 or more children - should not take the lives  of
people as simply as the chicken style that  they  are  playing.  We  believe
that such drivers do not belong on our roads.

We must also comment on the issue of the new card  licences.  We  appreciate
the stand that the department  has  taken  in  terms  of  acknowledging  the
administrative problems relating to the licences of drivers from the TBVC  -
areas the former homelands, which were  so-called  independent  homelands  -
because their records cannot  be  found  in  the  central  database  of  the
department. We are looking  at  a  situation  where  the  department  should
pronounce itself about what is going to happen at the end of  the  day  with
these drivers who have such licences. I know  in  the  House  that  the  hon
Dlulane is one of those licensed drivers whose records  are  still  sort  of
missing in the database because it was part  of  the  TBVC  areas  from  the
Transkei or Ciskei.

Hon Deputy Chairperson, we  must  also  speak  about  the  public  transport
safety. The department should also look into  the  issue  of  the  emergency
exits, because  there  is  the  view  that  some  of  the  deaths  which  we
experienced in the country  could  have  been  avoided.  In  particular  the
public transport system, whether it be taxis, buses or trains, if they  have
a quick way where people  can  exit  after  they  have  overturned  or  were
involved in a collision, and so on. We believe  this  could  be  efficiently
done in conjunction, or in consultation, with the South  African  Bureau  of
Standards, so that we have that as a standard  issue.  Currently,  it  would
seem that the emergency exits that  are  in  the  buses  cannot  be  quickly
kicked or pushed out in cases of accidents; that  is  also  assumed  in  the
many deaths when the bus went into the dam in the Free State.

We are also thankful for the statement that the acting  Minister  pronounced
in terms of the railway safety regulator. Very soon the  board  will  be  up
and running, and we are looking forward to having a  very  safe  environment
in terms of the trains. We are also looking forward to the  progress  report
from the task team - which involved the Department of Safety and Security  -
that was looking into a situation where we will have some form of  policing,
or people responsible  for  safety  and  security  on  the  trains.  I  must
strongly condemn our citizens who are not responsible, to  the  extent  that
they involve themselves in vandalising the trains; they steal windows,  they
steal cables, and at times that also contributes  to  the  train  accidents.
One could also make reference to some of the commuters who  thought  they're
justified, because the train is late, to burn  down  the  Pretoria  station.
Actually, as we speak of nation-building, some of these criminal  events  do
not contribute to developing our country as such.

I must also -  towards  concluding  my  speech,  hon  Deputy  Chairperson  -
comment on the reclassification of the roads, because at times there is  the
problem  that  a  significant  component  of  deaths  on   the   roads   are
pedestrians. We have a situation where some of the roads are  classified  as
district roads, as provincial  roads,  and  they  go  through  some  of  our
villages. At times the local municipalities - when we  do  our  constituency
work we engage and interact with them -  say  that  they  do  not  have  the
powers or authority to put down speed humps, which would  make  those  roads
calming zones, or slow down the speed of the vehicles on those roads.

I must also commend the department for the  good  work  that  it  is  doing,
because the Department of Transport is not solely  looking  into  the  roads
and vehicle issues, it also looks in terms of aviation.  As  we  stand  here
today, South Africa is declared a ... [Time expired.] Thank you.
Dean T S FARISANI (Limpopo): [Inaudible.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J MAHLANGU):  You  don't  have  to,
dean. I've found those seats to be very  uncomfortable,  I  must  tell  you.
Anyway, you can proceed.

Dean T S FARISANI: Thank you, very much. We take this opportunity  to  thank
our beloved national Minister, Comrade Dullar Omar, for  his  leadership  as
well as the colleague who is acting on  his  behalf,  Comrade  Jeff  Radebe.
They are like political twin brothers. Their leadership is good  for  us  in
the transport arena in South Africa.

We come from Limpopo, the province of peace.  According  to  Statistics  SA,
our growth rate to the end of  2001  was  6,3%,  compared  to  the  national
average of 2,3%. What is our secret?

The Department of Transport in Limpopo has contributed to  that  secret  and
to that success. We have started to engage in  youth  development  projects,
including  training  the  youth  on  project  management.  We  support  SMME
development and have also started seriously to democratise the bus  industry
so that it can contribute to the economic growth of our country.

The bicycle project has unfolded in a very  encouraging  way,  and  in  this
financial year we intend to roll over the programme to  all  the  districts,
to the extent that we might have two per district.

The same applies to the popular donkey-cart project. I  shall  be  launching
this project in the next few weeks and by the end of the financial  year  we
hope to have launched over 400 of these donkey carts, which we  are  marking
for visibility to enhance road safety.

In the area of civil aviation, we are  happy  to  announce  marked  progress
towards  the  materialisation  of  the  dream  to  use  Hoedspruit   as   an
international point of entry. We  are  in  the  process  of  devolving  P  R
Mphephu and Giyani Airports to the relevant areas.

Concerning inland water  policy,  draft  regulations  are  being  finalised.
Concerning the taxi industry, taxi-rank facilities and ownership status  has
been completed, and an inventory of taxi ranks in the province is in  place.
The route-verification process has been completed.

We take the issue of road safety  seriously.  The  strategic  programme  for
road safety,  which  was  adopted  by  the  national  department,  is  being
implemented vigorously in Limpopo. Needless to say,  our  soldiers  continue
to get their uniforms so that they can  do  their  job  properly,  including
equipment for speed measuring, for instance.

Our accident investigation unit and  inspectorate  are  in  place.  We  have
implemented  special  operations  for  safety  at  provincial  and  district
levels. We believe that we are by  far  the  leading  province  in  the  war
against corruption in the transport sector.

On issues of National Pedestrian  Safety  Strategy,  we  have  succeeded  in
provincialising and localising the  strategies  so  that  they  can  benefit
people directly on the ground.  This  is  done  partly  through  identifying
pedestrian hazardous locations. I hope this begins to explain to you why  we
have continued to bring down the level of accidents in the province.

Driver-of-the-year  competitions  were  held.  Safety-in-traffic   education
programmes and child-in-traffic programmes are the order of the day and  are
empowering our people on the ground.  Four  driver-education  seminars  have
been conducted and have assisted in improving what we do.

We conclude in two ways, by sharing with you the priorities for the  current
financial  year.  We  have  just  finalised  the  decentralisation  of   the
management of the government  fleet  to  different  departments.  Government
garages have been outsourced and only one will remain per district.

We  will  continue  to  facilitate  economic   growth   through   transport,
especially in our areas of spatial development initiatives, and  to  promote
infrastructure. We are already part of  the  great  plans  in  the  Dilokong
Transport Plan, which aims to promote mining through mobility in that area.

For the first time, the railway system is being discussed very seriously  in
Limpopo, and there will be new plans during the course of this  year.  Don't
be surprised, we are  also  thinking  of  attracting  the  Blue  Train  into
Polokwane and beyond, up to Hoedspruit. Some are thinking  that  this  dream
is too big for Limpopo, but  nothing  is  unreachable  in  the  province  of
peace.

HON MEMBERS: Hear! Hear!

Dean T S FARISANI: The Beit Bridge border post will receive  a  multipurpose
centre. Plans are in place.  It  will  be  a  pleasure  to  go  through  our
province to our neighbouring countries in the north.

We do have a few challenges, what you'll call budget  shortfalls.  Upgrading
of vehicle testing stations is still  a  challenge.  We  don't  have  enough
money. Establishment of additional traffic stations,  additional  equipment,
upgrading  of  traffic  control  centres,  funding  of  special  operations,
control of overloading and, in general, road  safety  programmes,  remain  a
very huge challenge.

Needless to say, we must conclude by prayer. I hold two ministries,  one  of
religion and one of transport. [Interjections.]  God  comes  first.  We  are
praying, in support of the Minister, that the recapitalisation project  will
give birth to joy,  happiness  and  celebration  for  the  people  of  South
Africa, including the taxi industry, and that the Road  Accident  Fund  will
become something different to what it had come to be  known  in  the  recent
past. May God bless you. [Applause.]

Mr K A SINCLAIR (Northern Cape): Hon Chairperson, I came to this  honourable
and august House today to speak on behalf of  the  people  of  the  Northern
Cape. I came, firstly, to say thank you and, secondly,  to  ask,  or  better
still, to plead.

I want to say thank you for the gift of R160 million  for  the  building  of
what is now our  new  home,  the  new  provincial  legislature  building  in
Kimberley. This was done after our hon Premier, various MECs  and  officials
convinced National Treasury that it was indeed  necessary  that  we  have  a
building from which to do our business - a  home  for  all.  Thank  you  for
that.

The main purpose, however, of my  presence  today  as  chairperson  of  this
portfolio committee is to once again reiterate our plea as  a  province  for
more funding, especially regarding infrastructure,  with  specific  emphasis
on our roads. But,  as  I  do  that,  it  is  important  to  understand  our
province, the Northern Cape.

The Northern Cape is geographically very big. Our province consists  of  30%
of the area of South Africa. It is closer by road to Durban  from  Kimberley
than it is to Port Nolloth, our  most  western  town,  from  Kimberley.  Our
province has got 22 000km gravel roads  and  5  400km  tarred  roads.  These
roads are the backbone of our economy,  built  on  mining,  agriculture  and
tourism. These are the roads that move sheep, cattle, tons  of  mealies  and
wheat, tons of export grapes and tons of salt a year.

These are  also  the  roads  that  bring  children  to  school,  that  unite
churchgoers and take government officials to the people. Frankly, these  are
also  the  roads  that  take  politicians  to  the  people  to   keep   them
accountable. These roads are the veins of our province.

Unfortunately, many  of  these  roads,  especially  the  gravel  roads,  are
deteriorating at an alarming rate. According to hon John Block, the MEC  for
this portfolio, speaking during the budget vote debate on the roads  on  our
province, this deterioration will result in an asset loss  of  R100  million
during the next financial year.

The ideal position today would have been to have a holistic picture  of  the
needs assessment of the roads in our province. The Department of  Transport,
Roads and Public Works in  our  province  has  completed  this  roads  needs
assessment study. The report highlights the deteriorating condition  of  our
provincial road network.

The key findings include: One, that the condition of the overall paved  road
network in the Northern Cape has deteriorated from 84% in good condition  in
'91, to 69% in 2002. This will cost the road  user  R20  million  in  excess
user costs this year; two, the asset value of the network  is  currently  R5
billion, with a possible maximum asset value of R7 billion, which  indicates
a loss of R2 billion already; three, according to this  assessment  study  a
total amount of R1,17 billion is necessary to get rid of this backlog.

I will, however, just focus on two issues today. Firstly, our gravel  roads.
The reality is that half of the province's  gravel  roads  are  graded  less
than twice a year by the district  municipality  on  an  agency  basis.  The
reason for that is that the allocation for roads is currently two thirds  of
R130 million - the  amount  budgeted  during  the  1996-97  financial  year.
Inflation and consequent price increases in diesel, parts and  labour  costs
are therefore not taken into account.

If we want to make comparisons, Namibia must certainly be the most  relevant
country. Circumstances regarding vastness, climate, water scarcity and  soil
types are very similar. The Namibian government allocates R8  141  per  year
per kilometre of gravel road. The Northern Cape's allocation per year is  R1
800 per kilometre. On a purely region-to-region basis, Namibia  thus  spends
more than three times what we spend as a province.

Regarding the division by the FFC, we admit that the province is getting  an
equitable share. I want  to,  however,  say  that  in  terms  of  the  facts
highlighted earlier, I really do not know how fair this division  is.  As  a
provincial legislature there is consensus  that  we  must  improve  our  own
revenue-collection mechanism.

In terms of an announcement made by the hon MEC for  Finance,  a  percentage
of  revenue  collected  by  transport  would  be  ploughed  back  into   the
department. An estimation of R6 million to  R8 million  per  year  would  be
reasonable. What I therefore want to put on the table, hon  Minister,  is  a
request for additional assistance from national Government  for  the  gravel
roads of the Northern Cape. An additional amount of  R30  million  per  year
would make it possible for the  district  municipalities  to  improve  their
efficiency.

The second issue is one of upgrading some  gravel  roads  to  tarred  roads.
Although  some  major  road  projects  are  underway,  it  is  important  to
highlight two roads. The  first  one  is  the  road  between  Springbok  and
Kommagas in Namaqualand, which  also  serves  the  diamond  mining  area  at
Kleinsee. The total cost would have been R54 million,  whilst  the  province
had  committed  R40 million  only.  Unfortunately,  the  company  mining  at
Kleinsee has offered no help in financing this  project.  The  shortfall  of
R14 million meant that the department had to leave out 15 kilometres of  the
60 kilometres originally planned for surfacing.  We  therefore  request  the
national Government to assist the province with the  shortfall  to  make  it
possible to complete the road as was envisaged.

The second road that I want to bring to your attention, hon Minister,  is  a
road around which the people on the north western part of our province  have
on many occasions raised concern.  This  is  the  road  from  Britstown  via
Vosburg  to  Carnarvon.  Many  serious  and  fatal  accidents  have  already
occurred on this road.

The advantages of tarring this road are numerous. If completed, it  will  be
an alternative route to the N1 to Cape Town and it will open up the  tourist
potential of the Karoo, Hantam  and  Namaqua  areas.  I  therefore  want  to
propose that the national department  registers  this  road  as  a  national
priority through a multiyear commitment and a commitment from  the  Northern
Cape provincial government to settle this long outstanding request.

Hon Chairperson and hon Minister, the Northern Cape is a province  at  work.
Despite  numerous  challenges  and  shortfalls,  the  Committee  on   Roads,
Transport  and  Public  Works  wants  to  assure  you  that  the  department
stretches every rand to the benefit  of  our  people  in  the  province.  We
however urge you to  respond  to  our  requests  and  pleas.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Thank you,  Chairperson.  Chairperson,  hon  Minister,  hon
Acting Minister I am also from the Northern  Cape.  What  I  would  like  to
mention here is that I am from a town called De  Aar  and  Noupoort  is  not
very far from De Aar; and as we know, De Aar was the second biggest  railway
junction in South Africa. A lot of  people  worked  for  the  South  African
Railways and the economy was really strong. But  what  happens  nowadays  is
that if one goes to De Aar and looks at the station, it is an  eye  sore  to
look at. We need to pay attention to that particular  area  over  there.  In
Noupoort itself,  the  unemployment  rate  is  about  80%.  People  find  it
extremely difficult to make ends meet over there.

'n Paar weke gelede was  daar  'n  tragiese  ongeluk  by  die  Saulspoortdam
waarin 49 mense van die  Noord-Kaap  verdrink  het  en  hul  families  groot
verliese gely het. Dit het my laat dink  aan  die  nooduitgange  van  busse,
sowel  as  taxi's.  Hierdie  is  'n  ernstige  saak  wat  deur  ons  en  die
Departement self aangespreek sal moet word. 'n Mens  kan  nie  verstaan  dat
ons busdienste in die land het vir jare  al,  maar  ons  kon  nooit  hierdie
skuiwergat raaksien nie - dat daar net 'n plakkertjie op 'n venster  is  wat
sê ``nooduitgang'', maar in werklikheid  is  dit  net  die  plakker  op  die
venster.

Ek wil van hierdie geleentheid gebruik maak om die Noord-Kaapse regering  te
bedank vir die miljoen rand wat hulle  beskikbaar  gestel  het  vir  daardie
mense. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[A few weeks ago there was a tragic accident at the Saulspoort Dam in  which
49 people from the Northern Cape  drowned  and  their  families  experienced
great losses. This reminded me of the exits on buses, as well  as  those  of
taxis. This is a very serious matter that should be addressed by us and  the
department. One cannot understand that since we have  had  bus  services  in
this country for many years we have not noticed this loophole -  that  there
is only a sticker on the window that  indicates  ``Exit'',  but  in  reality
this is only a sticker on a window.

I would like to  use  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  Government  of  the
Northern Cape for the R1 million that they have  made  available  for  those
people.]

Comrade Windvoël touched on the matter of the  classification  of  roads.  I
think this is a serious issue because municipalities are maintaining  roads,
provinces are maintaining roads and national Government is as well. We  need
to relook this particular issue because there is not even a single  province
that can really maintain their roads sufficiently. The previous speaker,  Mr
Sinclair, indicated the position in the Northern Cape.  That  is  true.  But
what we are doing in our province is to try and use whatever we can  and  we
can only use about 50%  of  our  budget.  I  think  it  would  be  an  ideal
situation if we can declare more of these roads national  roads.  This  will
assist us a great deal in our provinces.

Regarding ID card driver's licences, I know that many people were  reluctant
to renew their driver's licences. We have taken a  stance  in  the  Northern
Cape to say that this was the deadline.

As jy nie jou lisensie hernieu nie, gaan jy gevang  word.  [If  you  do  not
renew your licence you will be caught.]

And we intend putting up road blocks to make sure that whoever is driving  a
car has a valid driver's licence. We cannot afford the number  of  accidents
that we are having in our province.

The Minister mentioned that he will be having  a  Minmec  very  soon,  where
they are going to discuss the five-year road strategy. Hon Minister, I  want
you to pay special attention to the  Northern  Cape.  If  you  look  at  the
vastness of our province, it  is  in  actual  fact  costing  more  money  to
deliver services there. I know for a fact that only
850 000  people  live  in  that  particular  province,  but  to  put  it  in
geographical terms, I do not want to use the term  30%;  but  one  third  of
South Africa falls under the Northern  Cape.  It  is  an  enormous  task  to
deliver services in our province.

On the Road  Accident  Fund,  it  is  so  that  the  fund  finds  itself  in
difficulties at times. A number of fraud cases were  reported.  Lawyers  who
were not honest  and  loyal  submitted  false  claims.  I  want  us  as  the
legislature and as  our  department  to  come  up  with  special  plans  and
strategies to curb these kinds of fraudulent activities.

Ons kan nie bekostig dat daardie geld so misbruik word deur oneerlike  mense
in die land  nie.  [We  cannot  afford  to  have  money  misappropriated  by
dishonest people in our country.]

Chairperson, my acting chair alluded to the recap programme. We think it  is
very important for us to get  this  particular  programme  off  the  ground.
There is  also  an  understanding,  and  we  know  that  the  Department  of
Transport and of Trade and Industry  are  working  hand  in  glove  on  this
particular matter. We foresee a situation whereby  an  impression  is  being
created that Government is holding that process back, which is not  true.  I
would strongly recommend to the hon Minister that  he  has  a  meeting  with
Santaga and all the relevant stakeholders to clarify this matter. That  will
be to our advantage because we know there are certain obstacles.

With these few words I want to thank the hon Minister, Acting  Minister  and
the Minister present here today. We wish them well for the year to come.

Mr S M A MALEBO (Free State): Dit is plesierig om my buurman van die  Noord-
Kaap op te volg. [It is fun to speak after my neighbour  from  the  Northern
Cape.]

I have a problem with my voice as a result of illness and I hope I  will  be
audible. I also want to  express  my  appreciation  that  the  Minister  has
indeed  kept  the  home  fires  burning  whilst  Minister  Omar   is   still
recuperating.  Acting  Minister,  your  leadership  has  indeed  been   very
inspiring. It would be correct  to  say  that  you  have  ensured  that  the
departmental machinery is fully oiled to perform at its  peak  level,  given
the challenges of the time. It is also my wish that Minister  Omar  recovers
speedily. It  was  exciting  and  indeed  uplifting  to  have  seen  him  on
television the other day. It is even more inspiring to see  him  amongst  us
here. I am pleased to see that he is making such  remarkable  progress.  You
are in our prayers and in our hearts and  we  are  looking  forward  to  you
joining us fully.

From the Free State we return to this august House, inspired  and  confident
that despite the shortcomings of the first  nine  years  of  our  democratic
order, we shall see a better life for our  people.  This  was  not  just  an
election promise but this is a commitment. We have no choice but to  deliver
on it. We have no choice.

We are confident because  in  the  past  nine  years  we  learned  from  our
weaknesses, which resulted in rollovers and the nonexecution of projects  on
time. We have acquired experience of how to  deliver  projects  that  impact
directly on the lives of our people by executing this  on  time  and  within
the budget of the  allocated  resources  and  having  quality  products  and
projects.

This experience has enabled us to now package projects that are related  and
complement one another, that can procure jobs, reduce poverty and  grow  the
economy. Projects that achieve these kinds of developmental  objectives  are
those that are planned in an integrated manner and complements one  another,
offering a basket of  services  where  there  were  no  services  before  or
enhancing the quality of existing services. This is what we call  integrated
development in action,  led  by  roads  infrastructure.  Where  roads  lead,
development follows.

When we see this kind of development, we know that our  dream  of  a  better
life is and was never an empty promise. The  achievements  of  the  previous
financial year and the preceding years have indeed laid a  solid  foundation
for the better life we have strived for. The  new  financial  year's  budget
solidifies this foundation for the people's contract for  a  developed  Free
State and South Africa. Therefore, this foundation, as  represented  in  the
record of what was achieved, reflects the intentions of 1912 and the  dreams
of 1955 at Kliptown.

A quick overview of the previous financial year will indicate  that  we  are
finally beginning to address the backlog of  road  maintenance  and  of  our
current needs, as mentioned in the Minister's media address.

Major road rehabilitation of roads was done. Just a quick mention of a  few:
The Bothaville-Orkney road to facilitate the agricultural produce  to  reach
markets; the S1544 in QwaQwa to improve access for the rural poor to  social
amenities; the resealing of the Heilbron district and the resealing  of  the
Bultfontein-Wesselsbron road.

We have also noted the gravelling of several  roads  in  the  Southern  Free
State area, as well as in the north Kroonstad area. The Bethlehem area  will
be done in the new financial year. The Jammersdrift  Bridge  was  completed,
so enhancing the access of our people in  the  Southeastern  Free  State  to
markets and to social services in the area.

We do not wish to go through the whole list but we  do  wish  to  mention  a
few. All roads that were transferred to SANRAL will be  maintained  as  from
July this year by the said body. Their total  rehabilitation  will  be  done
once studies have been concluded on the  future  traffic  volumes  on  these
roads. These are the W5,6,8 and R30.

At the height of our road-building strategy and  provision,  the  Government
Garage section for road building will be restructured  so  that  it  becomes
the backbone of our road provisioning and maintenance in  the  province.  It
will be done so that the province, the  local  and  district  municipalities
can benefit from this restructuring. The strategy is for  municipalities  to
restructure for the betterment of their street network whilst  the  province
will utilise it for providing it with provincial roads.  This  facility  and
all equipment will from this year be available  to  all  municipalities  and
districts, but this will come at  a  cost.  All  of  us  will  pay  for  the
services that we get from this. At the same time, all the expertise in  this
road-building section, engineers, road superintendents and so on, will  also
be available to the municipalities, especially those that are unable to  buy
new road-building equipment and unable to appoint expertise in the  form  of
engineers, as mentioned.

Each district's road-building centre, with its engineers, will be  available
to municipalities,  as  mentioned.  This  is  about  sharing  resources  and
supporting one another in our endeavour to deliver  on  our  commitment.  At
the heart of our strategy to ensure that our roads are better and  safe  are
the  equipment  and  resources,  the  two  most  important   and   expensive
components in road provisioning and maintenance.  We  still  need  an  extra
R20million  to  get  all  our  equipment  ready   for   this   major   task.
Nevertheless, this year we would see an  increase  in  the  number  of  toll
roads in the province. The new one will be  built  south  of  Kroonstad  and
north of Bloemfontein and another one is likely to be erected on the R30.

With regard to transport, an intermodel ranking facility is being set up  at
Mangaung. This will be  done  in  partnership  with  the  SA  Commuter  Rail
Corporation and the Mangaung Municipality. Once completed, this will  change
the face of the Bloemfontein CBD.  This  is  an  example  of  an  inner-city
rejuvenation. Business must now follow by  investing.  We  have,  therefore,
with the first increase  of  our  road  budget  been  able  to  reduce  road
maintenance backlogs and roads usually regarded as poor  have  decreased  by
2%, while roads regarded as very poor have decreased by 4%. This gives us  a
total reduction of 6%.

With the new allocation I can confidently say that next year we will  record
a reduction of another 10%. This, together with  other  construction-related
work, has resulted in improved economic performance in  our  province.  With
our new budget of R761 495 for this  current  financial  year,  we  hope  to
announce even better results.

Chairperson, last month on 1 May we witnessed an  accident  that  is  beyond
description. A bus transporting workers plunged into a dam.

Agb lid, dit is nie 49 mense nie, maar wel 51 mense wat daar  verdrink  het.
[Hon member, it is not 49, but in fact 51 people who drowned there.]

This was after a very promising campaign  for  road  safety.  We  await  the
results of the investigation so that we can  improve  where  we  failed  and
enhance our efforts where we performed well.

In conclusion, a good example of what we can do is  the  development  of  an
interchange at Sasolburg. This is a project  that  will  cost  R30  million.
However,  the  immediate  spin-off  of  this  project  will  result  in  the
following: An immediate investment by the private sector  of  R200  million;
the facilitation of the process of infilling, which  will  assist  with  the
objective of  integration  of  communities  or  anti-apartheid  planning  of
residential areas; increased trade with neighbouring  provinces,  towns  and
countries, and it will also improve access to new  employment  opportunities
for the locals.

Development where it is led by road infrastructure  is  always  followed  by
investment that is sustainable with a basket of services. [Time expired.]

Mr S PASHA (Mpumalanga): Thank you Chairperson. The people have spoken,  the
provinces did speak. Change must indeed go on at a faster pace.  The  policy
budget speech presentation here today is a clear and real indication of  how
committed the ANC-led  Government  is  to  pushing  back  the  frontiers  of
poverty and bettering the  lives  of  the  people,  particularly  the  rural
masses of our country. The province upfront wish to  welcome  the  five-year
road infrastructure strategy as spelt out by the hon acting Minister.

The province of the ever-rising sun, Mpumalanga, has in the past,  and  now,
ensured that the budget appropriated is indeed in all respects in line  with
our vision of making public transport the real pride of our nation.

The province has during the year under  review  delivered  on  its  goal  of
providing significant policies and legislation to guide  transport  planning
in the  province.  Worth  mentioning  here  is  the  Land  Transport  Policy
Framework, Mpumalanga Provincial Transport Policy  and  soon  to  be  tabled
Mpumalanga Transport Bill and Public Transport Regulations.

Our commitment to providing quality public transport to  our  people  cannot
be overemphasised, particularly to those  in  extreme  rural  areas  of  the
province. We have thus began with the implementation  of  the  Bus  Contract
System  after  we  experienced  some  delays.  Design  and  compilation   of
provincial  bus  contracts,  with  the  aim  of  including  black   economic
empowerment strategies and also improving reliability, have started and  are
progressing well.

The bus commuter subsidy grant of R170  million  received  during  the  last
financial year, though not enough, has indeed assisted  the  province.  This
grant is an allocation to passenger operation services covering most of  the
rural communities of our province. We are thankful to those  operators  who,
in line with their social responsibility have built schools and continue  to
transport pensioners to paypoints free of charge.

Democratisation of the taxi industry has progressed well  in  the  province.
There have in the past  been  a  few  exceptions  where  disputes  occurred.
However, the department managed to deal with those accordingly. A report  at
hand now is that the first fleet of new taxi vehicles will soon  be  on  the
road. We just hope and we are eagerly waiting for this development.  I  will
surely be second to ride on those taxi vehicles after yourself.

The province is presently engaged in a study of taxi cooperatives  with  the
idea of resuscitating them. Through taxi  cooperatives,  not  only  will  we
address black economic empowerment,  but  also  the  creation  of  more  job
opportunities in the taxi industry.

Turning back to Shova Kalula, and I wish to invite my colleagues hon  VV  to
China, to go and experience himself what Shova Kalula is.  You  must  go  to
China. This  project,  as  reported  before,  is  progressing  well  in  the
province. The province will,  with  the  R800  000  grant  to  be  allocated
pending submissions of a business plan, roll out the  second  phase  of  the
project in the province. It is our intention,  funds  permitting,  that  the
project reaches all three districts of our province.  The  province  has  in
the previous and current year ensured that the budget  we  spend  is  geared
towards uplifting the rural masses without neglecting the urban areas.

Amounts of R466 836 000 and R53 177 000 respectively will be spent on  roads
and transport during this financial year.

Three major tourist roads, namely the White River to  Hazy  View  road,  for
those who know the Kruger National Park, the Middleburg to Bethal  road  and
the Bethal to Hendrina Road, was constructed in the past year and many  more
are being designed and planned.

With the allocated amount, the province will continue  work  on  the  Moloto
Road,  which  is  notorious  as  a  killer,  and  the  construction  of  the
Driefontein road, both in deep rural areas of our province.

The Karino-Plaston Road, leading to the newly constructed Kruger  Mpumalanga
Airport, will also be completed this financial year. And, Baba  Farisani,  I
want to assure you that this airport poses  no  threat  to  the  North  West
Province. Rest assured.

We have taken a conscious decision to expand both roads  and  the  transport
infrastructure network. In so doing, we will  also  ensure  that  small  and
emerging contractors access the opportunities brought  about  by  government
projects. We have ensured that women and youth will also benefit  from  this
project. The department is at work to simplify tender documents in order  to
make them more user-friendly for emerging contractors.

Traffic safety and control in the province is resident in the Department  of
Local Government, Traffic Safety and Traffic Control.

Overloading,  particularly  by  trucks,  is   costing   the   province   and
municipalities a fortune in road repairs. The  department  has,  during  the
past year, in an attempt to protect the road infrastructure,  built  several
weight bridges in many parts of our province. To date 188 000 vehicles  have
been weighed, amounting to fines totalling R20 million.  The  province  will
during this financial year also upgrade weight bridges to  alternate  routes
to the N4, because as we build weight bridges at the N4, most of the  trucks
coming from Gauteng and Northern Province divert to  our  provincial  roads.
We have taken a decision to ensure that we upgrade weight bridges  to  these
alternate roads.

Mpumalanga is a province at work. We have decided to be more  aggressive  on
corruption. To date 364 licences have been cancelled.

KwaMhlanga testing station has been temporarily closed and the  province  is
working closely with  Business  Against  Crime  to  combat  the  scourge  of
corruption. We are determined to be the victors.

In conclusion, let me, on behalf  of  the  Mpumalanga  province,  thank  the
Ministry of  Transport  for  the  continued  support  they  have  given  and
continue to give the province. To Comrade Dullah Omar, in absentia  now,  we
wish you all the best and success in life.

To hon Comrade Jeff Radebe, we say keep up the good work. The province  will
always be  ready  to  implement  all  the  plans  and  strategies  aimed  at
bettering the people's lives. Together we will  make  public  transport  the
pride of our nation.

Ke ya leboha. Baie dankie. [Thank you very much.]

Mr N M RAJU: Thank  you,  Chairperson.  Hon  Acting  Minister,  hon  special
delegates, hon colleagues, it is accepted that in any country  transport  is
a necessity, whether by road, rail, sea or air. But in  the  new  democratic
South Africa, public transport is almost  a  basic  need,  just  like  food,
clothing or shelter. We all know that during  the  dark  era  of  apartheid,
very little consideration was given  to  the  commuter  needs  of  the  vast
majority of our people.

The Group Areas Act had created black ghettoes and  racial  ethnic  enclaves
on the periphery of urban residential and industrial areas.

With the advent of democracy, the free movement of people to and from  work,
to go shopping,  to  visit  clinics  and  hospitals,  to  go  to  school  or
universities, unleashed a  new  sense  of  urgency  for  the  Government  to
address the needs of commuters in a holistic fashion. It  was  not  an  easy
task, as former Minister of Transport, Mr Mac Maharaj had conceded that:


  Changing attitudes is a long-term campaign and we will face  a  grim  and
  daunting task to reduce human carnage on our roads.

Under  Minister  Dullah  Omar's  stewardship,  the  Arrive  Alive  Awareness
Campaign took on a higher profile, but  unfortunately  the  carnage  on  our
highways and byways continues unabated.

Yes, we acknowledge that the authorities make strenuous efforts,  especially
during the peak Easter and Christmas periods  to  stall  the  high  accident
rates. But are we succeeding? What is it that is not being done to  minimise
accidents and fatalities? Have we seen an appreciable change in the  mindset
of drivers and the attitude of motorists, which  is  paramount  to  whatever
solutions the ministry may devise?

We throw up our hands in agonising despair  everytime  we  hear  of  another
accident resulting in fatalities. We think of the bus driving into a dam  in
the Free State recently, resulting in  over  50  deaths!  We  think  of  the
minibus  colliding  on  the   South   Coast   of   KwaZulu-Natal   recently,
transporting  school  children  from  school.  Again  fatalities,  loss   of
innocent lives of our children and there are  many  more  similar  accidents
resulting in  fatalities  and  casualties.  The  costs  incurred,  not  only
physical losses but  losses  to  the  state  and  the  economy,  are  indeed
inestimable.

We remain optimistic that the conversion of driver's licences into  ID-card-
type licenses will help to weed out the chaff from the grain. The  chaff  is
the hundreds of ill-gotten licences, as alluded to by  my  hon  friend  from
Mpumalanga, the  Acting  Chairperson  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Public
Services.

However, I must compliment the authorities in  my  province,  for  instance,
who started holding road blocks immediately after the deadline had come  and
gone. And I have  seen  many  drivers  being  booked  for  still  using  old
licences and other misdemeanours.

The DA calls for a sustained assault on and  apprehending  of  offenders  in
this respect.
Further in my province, the Department of Transport is on the hunt  for  all
miscreant drivers and it has put into place a telephone hotline, called  the
impimpa hotline, to phone and report  any  misdemeanours,  any  breaking  of
traffic laws and road rules. It is a kind  of  whistle-blowing.  In  fact  I
would like to say that the number plate of the Department  of  Transport  in
my province is ZTOO, zero tolerance, no, no.

Just yesterday, the Select  Committee  on  Public  Services  listened  to  a
briefing by the South African National Roads Agency  on  the  National  Road
Network. Interesting information  was  supplied  to  the  committee  on  its
management cycle, budget procedure, expenditure details, and  so  on.  There
was some information on poverty alleviation allocation and  expenditure.  In
the summary provided for the period 2001 to 2004, an amount of R203 185  762
was set as an ... [Time expired.]

Mr M I KLAAS (Gauteng): Chairperson, hon Minister  and  hon  members,  since
the ANC came into power almost a decade ago, we pledged  key  conditions  of
prosperity and a better future for our people. We set  out  a  clear  agenda
and  articulated  strategic   priorities,   which   are   economic   growth,
development,  employment  creation  and  infrastructure,   quality   service
delivery and good governance.

Our objectives were to touch the souls  of  our  citizens  and  a  sense  of
humanity and hope in all their places of residence and of work. To date,  in
all places and areas identified, we have already  put  in  place  structures
and plans that will ensure the acceleration of our goal  of  a  better  life
for all. To make headway for all, I have mentioned, we have to deal  with  a
long list of brutal realities of apartheid, which include,  amongst  others,
mismanagement  of  the  economy,  debt  burden,  destruction  of  our  human
resources and a dysfunctional civil service and the marginalisation  of  the
majority from mainstream economic activity.

The Gauteng  Department  of  Transport  has  succeeded  in  normalising  the
minibus taxi industry from a violent strife-torn  industry  to  the  current
situation. The department committed itself to embark  on  efforts  to  bring
about peace and stability in the taxi industry. The democratisation and  the
formalisation of 130 local associations have  been  accomplished  with  over
80% of these having gone through the second round of  democratic  elections.
The efforts to find a  lasting  peace  in  the  industry  has  further  been
boosted by the formation of a nationally recognised and representative  body
in South Africa and the democratically elected provincial  taxi  council  of
Gauteng.

One of the top priorities in the MTEF cycle is the recapitalisation  of  the
minibus taxi industry. Major upgrading of public transport  facilities  such
as taxi ranks and modal interchange will be required.  The  department  will
work closely with the  metropolitan  and  district  municipalities  in  this
regard. The modal integration is a priority in  Gauteng.  The  programme  is
aimed  at  integrating  all  existing  and  potential  modes  of  transport.
Supported by an integrated fare collection  system,  this  aims  to  promote
public  transport  enhancing  efficiency,  eliminating  duplication,  whilst
promoting accessibility of public transport to all users. As  part  of  this
process, provision of  public  transport  and  facilities  for  people  with
disabilities will also be a focal point.

As part of the ongoing integration of the public transport modes at all  the
different spheres of Government, we hope that  the  commuter  rail  function
will in future be  devolved  from  the  national  to  the  lower  levels  of
Government - and we believe that this will further boost the development  of
integrated transport plans. The registration process of all  subsidised  bus
operators under  the  South  African  Bus  Operators  Association  has  been
realised. As part of the ongoing efforts  towards  achieving  transformation
in the bus industry, about 15 entities representing five companies owned  by
women operators are currently receiving capacity-building support  from  the
department.

The year 2002 was again an eventful year for the  Gauteng  rapid  rail  link
project. At the opening of the legislature last year, it was announced  that
the national treasury, through  its  public-private  partnership  unit,  had
given its first authorisation for the project to proceed.  The  request  for
pre-qualification commenced towards  the  end  of  February  and,  after  10
submissions were evaluated, two  consortia  were  pre-qualified.  They  have
three  of  the  world's  best  and  largest  train  manufacturing  companies
involved, some of the largest  and  best  international  and  South  African
construction companies and some of the best  train  operating  companies  in
the world. Both these consortia met all the  pre-qualification  requirements
and have the experience and ability to successfully design, finance,  build,
operate and maintain the Gauteng rapid rail link.

The final request for proposal documents was submitted  to  the  bidders  in
November last year. They have until June 2003 to submit their proposals.  It
is expected that the preferred bidders will be  selected  and  announced  in
September this year. An anti-bribe  pact  was  signed  between  the  Gauteng
provincial government and the bidders to ensure that bribery and  corruption
will not take place. As the project proceeds,  its  needs  become  more  and
more evident. It must not only  alleviate  the  growing  traffic  congestion
between Tswane and Johannesburg  but  also  stimulate  economic  growth  and
create jobs.

Road safety under traffic management: in the effort  to  enhance  efficiency
and effectiveness  in  the  law-enforcement  processes,  two  units  of  the
department - transport inspectors and traffic officers -  have  been  merged
into one unit. It is anticipated that  a  further  plus-minus  250  officers
will be recruited for future deployment and a work  study  investigation  on
this aspect is expected to be completed  by  November  2003.  Recently,  the
initiated integrated approach of law  enforcement,  which  incorporates  all
different spheres of Government in a coordinated and coherent  manner,  will
continue as a pivotal point around which effective law enforcement  will  be
promoted.

The current strategy of  multidisciplinary  joint  operations  at  hazardous
locations  between   Gautrans,   metropolitan   municipalities   and   local
authorities is bearing fruit. During the Easter 2003 period, about 47%  less
road fatalities were reported compared to Easter 2002. The number  of  fatal
crushes also reduced by 48% - from 35 to 18. It  must  be  noted  that  more
than 80% of all road fatalities  occur  within  the  jurisdiction  areas  of
metros and district local councils. Thank you. [Applause.]

Mr T MHLAHLO (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson,  we  have  gained  a  tremendous
amount of experience over the past few years. Such experiences  have  helped
us reflect  on  our  ability  and  readiness  to  adjust  according  to  the
challenges of the present time. Through  these  experiences,  we  have  been
able to address a number of  problems  as  well  as  challenges  facing  the
province, which certainly improved and accelerated service delivery,  within
the  framework  of  the  department's  multiyear  strategic  plan.  We  have
carefully  and  systematically  selected  and  prioritised   key   strategic
objectives for the year 2002-03.

These strategic objectives are in line  with  the  national  and  provincial
legislative framework and the President's state-of-the nation  address,  the
state-of-the-province  address  by  the  Premier  of   the   province,   the
provincial growth and  development  strategy  as  well  as  the  medium-term
revenue  and  expenditure  framework.  Through  this  financial  year,   the
department is committed to the maximum utilisation  of  available  resources
in pursuance of both its strategic objectives and quality of  land  use  and
transportation integrated planning; the provision of an efficient and  cost-
effective  public  passenger  multimodal  transport  system;  including  the
promotion  of  a  nonmotorised  transport  system;  traffic  administration;
control; road safety and  public-private  partnership  through  facilitating
taxi  transformation  and  recapitalisation;  reviewing   public   transport
subsidies; promoting  private-public  partnerships;  reducing  the  rate  of
accidents on  our  provincial  roads  and  intensifying  the  fight  against
HIV/Aids in the transport sector.

In view of the above,  the  department's  priority  for  this  year  was  to
continue and to complete all the multiyear capital expenditure  projects  in
progress and, as contained in the department's 2002 to 2004 strategic  plan,
the business plan  and  the  departmental  budget  estimates.  The  projects
undertaken by the department and achievements attained  under  each  project
are briefly articulated in this report.

As far as the taxi  recapitalisation  project  is  concerned,  although  the
national taxi recapitalisation programme's progress is  slow,  the  province
has continued to undertake preparatory measures in terms  of  levelling  the
playground with special focus on  training  and  the  formalisation  of  the
industry. To this effect, the department sponsored  a  taxi  training  study
tour in July and August this year. This was  organised  and  funded  by  the
public passenger  transport  study  tour  to  Tanzania,  Uganda,  Kenya  and
Zimbabwe, for the Eastern Cape taxi council officials and  the  department's
officials responsible for the taxi and public bus transport service  in  the
province.

This study tour  was  undertaken  as  an  integral  component  of  capacity-
building and empowerment of the industry  under  the  taxi  recapitalisation
programme. It is the consensus of all those who  undertook  this  tour  that
the study tour was very successful and  that  there  were  several  findings
that will make a difference in our taxi industry if properly implemented  by
both the taxi industry and the  Government  in  our  province.  It  is  also
believed that the department was the first and the only one in  the  country
to undertake such a project jointly with the taxi council and we  hope  that
this will assist other provinces to follow suit.

In an effort to improve the quality of subsidised public  transport  in  the
Transkei region and services in the  rural  areas  of  the  former  Transkei
region of the province, the department  is  undertaking  a  route  viability
study  from  July  this  year.  The  main  output  of  this  project  is  to
crystallise  various  prerequisites  for  providing  a  qualitative,   cost-
effective, sustainable and demand-responsive public transport system in  our
province. Of course, this information will  assist  our  strategic  planning
for the future in our province. The project is behind  schedule  because  of
some operators' reluctance to participate in  the  project  and  to  provide
critical operating information on statistics.  Meanwhile  the  passenger-bus
subsidy scheme in the Transkei area will continue  to  be  provided  by  the
provincial government.

With the provincial land-transport framework, the department, in  accordance
with the provisions of the  National  Land  Transport  Transitional  Act  of
2000, completed the preparation  for  the  first  provincial  land-transport
framework for  the  province  of  the  Eastern  Cape.  This  was  officially
submitted to the national  Minister  of  Transport  in  January  this  year.
According to the National Department of Transport, the Eastern Cape was  one
of the first two provincial departments to  complete  the  study  before  31
December last year, which was the original deadline. The deadline has  since
been extended to 31 March this year.

The East London and Umtata Kei Railway project continued  to  be  the  major
undertaking by the department during the previous financial  year  and  this
year. Phase two and  three  -  preliminary  and  detailed  design  including
limited construction - was awarded to  a  particular  company  called  Arcus
Gibb and Consortium in July last year.  The  project  implementation  is  on
schedule and actual refurbishment construction work is to commence in  April
this year. The socioeconomic impacts  of  this  project  on  other  sectors'
projects are likely to outweigh any investment in  the  envisaged  efficient
and cost-effective rail mode of transport to be integrated with other  modes
of transport within the East London and Umtata development corridor.

According to Spoornet's senior officials, the department is  rated  high  in
its efforts to rehabilitate railway as a viable mode  of  transport  in  the
province. At the same time, the  proposed  extension  of  commuter-passenger
services from East London  to  King  William's  Town  has  experienced  some
delays due to legal and financial constraints. This is an integrated  inter-
modal transport system involving rail, bus and  taxi  in  the  Eastern  Cape
province. Metrorail is expected to  continue  playing  its  role  until  the
project is completed in the interests of captive public users.

This project  was  to  facilitate  the  restructuring  of  Government  Motor
Transport in line  with  the  national  framework  for  restructuring  state
assets whilst shifting the underlying philosophy from a  state-public  to  a
public-private partnership service delivery. Tenders for  service  providers
were advertised in December last year and closed on 24  January  this  year.
The contract to the successful tender has been awarded at the  beginning  of
this  year.  The  project  implementation  is  on  schedule  and  department
performance is considered satisfactory.

Traffic  administration  remains  the  most  important  challenge   in   our
province. The department has developed strategies to promote and  facilitate
traffic safety knowledge by actively pursuing the ideas  and  objectives  of
the  national  road  safety  programme,  which  embraces  the  Arrive  Alive
campaign; to maximise  traffic  control  and  law  enforcement  through  the
construction of several weight bridges and vehicle testing stations; and  to
enhance the management of the national traffic  information  system,  Natis,
in terms of the registration and licensing of motor vehicles and its  impact
on maximising revenue collection  for  motor  vehicle  licensing,  fees  and
penalties. We need 800 traffic officers in order  to  be  effective  in  our
provincial road network, which covers 47 000km across the province.

As far as the Mayibuye Transport Corporation is concerned, the  tenders  for
service providers to participate in public-private  partnership  within  the
provincial government closed on 26 May this year and the  contract  will  be
awarded to the successful bidder in the  very  near  future.  This  contract
will be monitored by a  separate  supervising  and  monitoring  firm  to  be
appointed very soon.

As far as Shova Kalula, which is the national coordinated  bicycle  project,
in Eastern Cape is concerned, it was delayed. Our provincial  Department  of
Transport has implemented a pilot phase of its own vision of the project  as
a means of nonmotorised, yet efficient and  affordable  transport  only  for
learners  in  the  rural  schools  of  Magadla  in   Alfred   Nzo   District
Municipality, and  Mtikrakra  in  Chris  Hani  District  Municipality.  This
project is a joint venture with the district municipalities as well  as  the
provincial Department of Education.

Mr S N MTETWA (KwaZulu-Natal): Madam Chair, it is an honour for me to be  in
this meeting where I will be able to see Comrade Dullar Omar.  Wherever  you
are, since you are absent from the room, I wish you well and I also pass  my
greetings to Comrade Jeff Radebe and everyone.

Let me begin by telling you a true story. After what  happened  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, the Minister and the department have decided to  call  an  imbizo  of
all religious leaders. The Thekwini  City  Hall  was  packed.  The  Minister
wanted religious leaders to help answer the question: What is it, what  else
is it, that needs to be done in order to eliminate these accidents that  are
happening?

The story that I want to tell you  is,  when  the  Minister  was  saying  to
everybody:

Thula!
Angeke ngithule ngimbona umshayeli wethu
Ethath' impilo yami eyifaka emathuneni
Ngeke ngithule. (Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[Keep quiet,
No, I'll never keep quiet
and watch the driver take my life,
And toss it into the grave
No, I'll never keep quiet!]

This means that the message of  mpimpa  [informing]  should  be  everywhere.
That was the story.

Eighty per cent of people and goods  in  KwaZulu-Natal  are  transported  by
road and our ports handle the major proportion of our  international  import
and export trade.

It is common cause that the transport  portfolios  throughout  South  Africa
are  significantly  underbudgeted.  This  is  reflected  by  the  fact  that
economic services in South Africa are allocated  only  10%  of  the  overall
budget, although we know the reasons and accept them.

Our programme to review the KwaZulu-Natal provincial road network  has  made
considerable  progress  and  we  have  developed  a  uniform  prioritisation
methodology that defines the status of roads.

The identification of the provincial road network will  allow  the  KwaZulu-
Natal Department of Transport to budget for and plan more  holistically  the
development of a balanced  road  network  that  accommodates  an  intermodal
transport system and promote safe and affordable public transport.
Speaking about delivery in rural areas versus traditional  leaders,  I  want
to say we do not have a major problem, as one may anticipate.  But  I  think
suffice to say in recent years, since the  introduction  of  the  MTEF,  the
department  has  dedicated  the  budget  to  the  African  Renaissance  Road
Upgrading Programme. This programme targets the  upgrading  of  major  rural
transport corridors from gravel to black-top surfaces.

But, when you talk about pushing back the frontiers of poverty  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, we usually say, let  us  not  talk  about  it,  but  let  us  do  it.
Therefore, I would like to refer to Zibambele. Zibambele is a programme  for
the maintenance of rural road by labour-intensive methods. It is  contracted
to destitute rural  households.  Woman-headed  households  are  specifically
targeted - currently some 98% of Zibambele contracts are awarded  to  woman-
headed households.

A total of 14 000  contracts  will  be  awarded  this  financial  year.  The
KwaZulu-Natal Department of Transport anticipates increasing the  number  of
Zibambele contracts available by some 4 000 contracts on an annual basis.

When you talk about black  economic  empowerment,  KwaZulu-Natal  refers  to
Vukuzakhe.  Vukuzakhe  is  the  KwaZulu-Natal  Department   of   Transport's
emerging contractors' programme. It is a stacked advance programme in  which
contractors receive training, mentorship and other support  to  assist  them
to advance through a contract designed to prepare them  to  compete  on  the
open market. [Interjections.] [Time expired.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Baba, ngiyaxolisa. [I am sorry, sir.]

Nkskn B N DLULANE:  Sihlalo  obekekileyo,  Mphathiswa,  tata  uJeff  Radebe,
amalungu abekekileyo, xa ndiza kuthetha  ngezothutho,  izixhobo  ezisisiseko
(infrastructure)  kwezothutho  zingundoqo,  kuphuhliso  loluntu  nezoqoqosho
kwihlabathi   liphela.   Abantu   basebenzisa   inkonzo   yezothutho   ukuya
ezimalikeni,  xa  besiya  emsebenzini  naxa  besiya  kuyifuna,   xa   befuna
ukuxhamla iinkonzo zempilo, ezentlala-kahle,  intlala-kahle  ke  zinkamnkam,
xa bethatha inxaxheba  kwezoqoqosho  kwaye  xa  befuna  ulonwabo.  Ezothutho
yinjini   yokukhula   kwezoqoqosho,   kwaye   zezothutho   ezisisiqinisekiso
sonxibelelwano lwesizwe ndawonye nehlabathi liphela.

[Ms B N DLULANE: Hon Chairperson, Minister, Mr  Jeff  Radebe,  hon  members,
talking about transport, infrastructure is essential to  social  development
and the economy in the whole world. People use transport services to get  to
the markets, when going to  work  and  to  seek  employment,  access  health
services, social services and social grants, when they  participate  in  the
economy and when they want to engage in recreation. Transport is the  engine
to facilitate growth in  the  economy  and  it  is  transport  that  ensures
communication of a nation with the rest of the world.

It is the vision and the views of the ANC, as spelt out in the programme  to
rebuild the development of society,  the  RDP,  to  improve  the  lives  and
living conditions of the people. One of the conditions that  the  department
is so  determined  to  focus  on  is  rectifying  travelling  delays,  those
astonishing hold-ups that are a problem to  this  department  of  transport.
They have been caused by methods of settlement that were not true  and  real
but perverse as well as unfortunate. This is a cloud that was left to us  by
the oppressive government.]

The introduction of nonmotorised transport is seen as one way of  addressing
the shortage of transport facilities in rural and semiurban areas.

Xa ndiza kuthetha ngezithuthi ezingenayo  injini  (nonmotorised  transport),
isebe likazwelonke lenze isiqalo esibizwa ngolokuba  nguShova  Lula,  esithi
ngesiXhosa ngushova kalula, ezothutho ngeebhayisekile.

Okokuqala, ibijoliswe kumabanga  aphantsi  emfundo,  kwabangathathi  ntweni,
ezilalini. Nanjengoko sele nimvile  umntakwethu  ophuma  phesheya  kweKoloni
okokuba phaya  kwaMagadla,  kwezinye  zeelali  ezingaphaya  eMatatiele,  ibe
lulutho le nkqubo  isakuba  ifikelele  nakweli  lethu  iphondo,  ngokunjalo,
inwenwele ezidolophini, empahandleni nakubasebenzi basezidolophini  abahamba
imigama emide ukuya emisebenzini.

Eli phulo lokuqala libe yimpumelelo. Wonke amaphondo alixhasile ngoyaka  ka-
2000. Iivenkile ezili-11 ziye  zavulwa  ngenxa  yokuxhaswa  koShova  Kalula.
(Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[On the  matter  of  nonmotorised  vehicles,  the  national  department  has
embarked on an initiative called  ``Shova  Lula''  -  in  isiXhosa,  we  say
``shova kalula bicycle transport''.

In the first place, it was intended  for  people  at  the  lower  levels  of
education, the indigent in the villages. As you heard my  brother  from  the
Transkei saying, in kwaMagadla in some of the villages  of  Matatiele,  this
programme was something that reached our province  also  and,  in  the  same
way, extended to towns in the rural area as well as to  people  employed  in
towns, who walk long distances to places of employment.

This first campaign was a success. All the provinces  supported  it  in  the
year 2000. Eleven shops were  opened  because  of  the  support  of  ``Shova
kalula.'']

The  demand  by  potential  users  was  good  and  got  support  from  local
politicians and officials. The positive spin-off of this programme has  been
the creation and improvement  of  the  rural  road  infrastructure  such  as
access roads, low-level access bridges, footpaths,  sidetracks  as  well  as
various safety gadgets.

Local authorities and provinces have  to  take  into  account  the  need  to
provide  for  cyclists  and  pedestrians  in  road  planning   and   design.
Alleviating rural poverty by promoting small, medium and  macro  enterprises
would be achieved by using local expertise in the  running  and  maintaining
of bicycle  transport,  developing  mobile  bicycle  transport  clinics  and
shops, and training interns in the bicycle transport  business,  which  will
create opportunities for young people in rural and urban areas.

The success of bicycle projects in South Africa has caught the  eye  of  the
World Bank and, as a result, has asked South African specialists  to  assist
in starting pilot projects in Senegal, Ghana and Guinea.

On the issue of road transport,  the  disparities  in  remuneration  between
local and provincial government traffic officials, who are there  to  ensure
road safety, have to be taken into account. Minister, I fail  to  understand
why traffic officials in local authorities  are  paid  more  than  those  in
provincial government.

Likhwelo nje. Andinamona, kodwa mayijongwe loo nto. [It is merely a  wake-up
call. I am not jealous, but let that be looked into.]

The disparities need to be investigated and  addressed.  The  department  is
busy examining a proposal for a new classification of roads, which  aims  to
categorise roads according to the  function  they  perform  and  assign  the
appropriate authority  to  take  over  responsibility  for  maintaining  the
roads.

According to the new classification, some provincial roads will be  included
as part of the strategic road  network  for  which  national  Government  is
responsible. In the same way, local roads could be classified  by  strategic
road network for provincial government. The new classification  will  ensure
that unproclaimed roads, which are mostly  rural,  are  properly  classified
into a rural network and assigned to the appropriate authority.

When it comes to safety at  sea,  the  sea  is  a  very  important  mode  of
transport, because 90% of world trade is conducted by sea. In  the  area  of
safety, there has been general improvement in coastal safety systems.

The South African Maritime Safety Agency, a statutory body that  reports  to
the Minister of Transport, is responsible for the promotion  of  the  safety
of life and property at sea. It is also responsible for  the  prevention  of
sea  pollution  by  pollutants  emanating  from  ships,  the  management  of
incidents, casualties and wrecks and participation in search and rescue.

South Africa has contributed actively  to  search  and  rescue  in  southern
oceans and is seen as a focal point for that. It is  for  this  reason  that
the department sees the establishment of the Maritime Rescue Control  Centre
as a priority and has included it in its 2003  budget.  The  Department  has
concluded bilateral research and rescue agreements with Madagascar.

The  Special  Development  Initiatives,   the   SDIs,   are   public-private
partnership programmes. The involvement of the department in these  projects
focuses on providing  infrastructure,  black  economic  empowerment,  skills
transfer and the creation of sustainable jobs.

The SDIs, which the department initiated,  are  Lebombo,  West  Coast,  Fish
River, Maputo Development Corridor,  Wild  Coast,  Phalaborwa  and  Richards
Bay.

Let me take Maputo Corridor as an  example  to  show  the  impact  of  these
initiatives on the economy. The combined effect of the Maputo  Corridor  and
the new border post will make the journey between  Maputo  and  Johannesburg
quicker, safer and smoother,  decrease  freight  transport  costs,  assuming
that increased efficiency and reliability will lead to increased volumes  in
both directions  and  pass  cost  savings  on  to  customs  because  of  the
competitive nature of the road freight industry.

Transport has a critical role in the implementation of Nepad. It is  crucial
in creating  an  effective  co-ordinated  African  response  to  the  global
market. Challenges are market-access mobility and system integration.

The commitment of the department ...  Mhlali-ngaphambili,  i-ANC  iyaluxhasa
olu hlahlo lwabiwo-mali.  Enkosi.  Laphela  ixhesha  [Chairperson,  the  ANC
supports this budget. Thank you. [Time expired.]]

isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[Mr  M  S  MALAKOANA  (KwaZulu-Natal):  Hon  members,  Acting  Minister   of
Transport  -  Mr  Radebe,  and  distinguished  guests,  I  appreciate   this
opportunity given to me to make a really  substantive  contribution  to  the
discussion.]

Transport is a vital link in all people's lives. It is  the  artery  of  the
economy. It ensures the freedom of the individual in a country of such  long
distances. It links our country and  its  entire  people  with  the  outside
world through trade and investment.  Above  all,  like  everything  else  in
life, transport, with all its connotations, is indeed also  political.  But,
of course, it is not my intention and my interest at this  time  to  address
the political issues of transport.

My point of departure is to begin by looking at the issue  of  rural  roads.
In most developing countries the provision of rural roads is linked  to  the
needs of those dependent on  agriculture  to  subsist  and  earn  an  income
through agriculture. Indeed this could not  have  been  the  case  in  South
Africa because of the apartheid legacy. Much fewer people are  dependent  on
agriculture for a living and the numbers continue to decline.

In fact, the foundational and fundamental philosophy of self-help and  self-
reliance seems not to be given enough space for it to thrive.  Over  37%  of
rural households depend on income generated outside their  communities.  The
implication of the above statement is  that  it  is  vital  that  it  be  an
integrated approach if we are to meet the basic needs  of  people.  I  doubt
very much if generally there is much evidence  of  this  in  all  provinces.
There is also a clearly discernible lack  of  capacity  at  local  level  to
capitalise on the  provision  of  rural  roads.  Herein  lies  the  greatest
challenge to use the provision of roads  as  a  motor  for  development  and
upliftment in rural areas.

One could of course unjustifiably say that it is the  lack  of  capacity  at
local level, whereas the truth, whether whispered or shouted aloud, is  that
national Government and provincial governments still perform functions  that
are  supposed  to  be  executed  by  local  government,  for  example,   the
construction of community access roads. This needs  to  be  addressed  as  a
matter of urgency.

Diverting my focus to the issue of black economic empowerment and  the  role
that is played and should be played by the  department,  the  Department  of
Transport is  the  key  to  economic  and  social  development  of  all  the
provinces, as has been confirmed by the hon the Minister, Bhungane.

Thus, one needs  to  put  it  on  record  that  we  appreciate  greatly  and
tremendously the role that has been played by the  department  in  terms  of
ensuring that the PDIs  benefit  from  programmes.  However,  one  likes  to
caution the department to be watchful as it  wants  information  that  large
monopolies have been and are being created when it comes  to,  for  example,
the disestablishment of other bus  companies  under  the  pretext  of  black
economic empowerment. It is therefore my considered view  that  even  though
it is always the intention  of  the  department  to  be  involved  in  black
economic empowerment, a  transparent,  fair  and  equitable  process  should
always evolve.

I say this because  some  schemes  have  mushroomed  in  some  quarters  but
crumbled as a result  of  the  lack  of  a  strategic  vision  that  can  be
transformed into a practical and sustainable plan of action.

It is not, of  course,  my  intention  to  discourage  the  department  from
fortifying its efforts when it comes  to  black  economic  empowerment,  but
what I have raised above deserves serious consideration.

Coming back to roads  again,  main  roads  and  road  infrastructure  are  a
passion for me as a I come from the province that has  serious  backlogs  in
roads infrastructural development.

Kuyaziwa  ukuthi   uma   sikhuluma   ngeKwaZulu-Natali   ithatha   esandleni
sababesiphethe ondlebezikhanyilanga, amaphuma emi,  ayekade  eyidlavadlavaza
indawo  yakithi.  Njengamanje  sibhekene  naleyo  nkinga  yesimo   esinjalo.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraph follows.)

[It is well known that KwaZulu-Natal inherited its legacy from  the  whites,
who ruinously administered our land. That's the situation we are faced  with
today.]

There has been a proclivity to construct new roads to  the  total  disregard
of maintaining the existing infrastructure. There  can  be  no  denying  the
fact that much  of  the  infrastructure  in  more  developed  areas  is  not
maintained properly. Crumbling road surfaces are common  everywhere  in  the
country, even in my province too. Though we do try to contain the  speed  of
disintegration, the appearance of potholes in tarred roads has  led  to  the
proliferation of warning signs against  potholes  over  vast  areas  of  our
country. This is a first and is cause for concern.

Whilst I emphasise the importance of increasing expenditure on rural  roads,
I am in no way implying that this should happen at the expense of  the  road
infrastructure on which the first-world part of our  economy  is  dependent.

Dr P J C NEL: Mevrou die  Voorsitter,  die  NNP  is  dankbaar  dat  die  agb
Minister van Vervoer vandag, ten spyte van swak gesondheid,  sy  sitplek  in
hierdie Raad kon inneem vir 'n paar oomblikke.  Ons  bid  hom  baie  sterkte
toe.

Ek haal dan ook graag aan uit die voorwoord tot die  nuutste  besigheidsplan
van die departement wat deur dié agb Minister geskryf  is.  (Translation  of
Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chairperson, the NNP is grateful that the  Minister  of
Transport can take his seat in this Council for a  few  moments  today,  ill
health notwithstanding. We wish him every strength.

I also would like to quote from the preface of the  latest  Budget  Plan  of
the department, which was written by this hon Minister.]

I quote as follows:


  Transport is a  basic  necessity  for  sustainable  social  and  economic
  development and an enabler in addressing poverty and development needs.

Dit, Voorsitter, in kort vat na my mening al die doelstellings van 'n  goeie
vervoerstelsel saam en vorm verseker 'n goeie basis vir die  opstel  van  'n
besigheidsplan. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[This, Chairperson, in my opinion briefly summarises all the  objectives  of
a good transport system and ensures a  good  basis  for  drafting  a  budget
plan.]

It is, however, disappointing to learn from this budget-plan  document  that
the  backlog  with  regard   to   road   and   commuter-rail   capital   and
infrastructure has escalated over the years to such an extent that it  might
lead to unacceptable consequences should  it  not  be  addressed  adequately
within the medium term.

The most important challenge for the department of  transport  in  the  Free
State is the closure of the gap between the backlog and the  new  needs  and
to bring existing infrastructure into an acceptable state of repair. In  the
Free State, the backlog in the resealing and  rehabilitation  of  roads  has
resulted in an old road network that requires far more maintenance than  can
be provided or afforded. A total of only R280 million will  be  invested  in
provisioning  for  and  maintenance  of  the  road  infrastructure  in  this
financial year.

However, the estimated need to address the backlog in the Free State over  a
realistic period of 10 years is approximately R1 billion per annum. My  plea
to the hon Minister today is  to  negotiate  for  more  money  for  all  the
provinces for this purpose. South Africa's road to safety and  the  road  to
riches cannot be a road full of potholes.

Die NNP het egter groot waardering vir wat die agb LUK en  sy  amptenare  in
die Vrystaat in die departement vermag  met  die  beperkte  fondse  tot  hul
beskikking. Dit het, glo ek, sekerlik bygedra tot  die  12%  afname  in  die
padongeluksyfer in die Vrystaat die afgelope Kersseisoen.  Dit  is  voorwaar
'n prestasie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The NNP, however, has great appreciation for  what  the  hon  MEC  and  his
officials in the department in the Free State  have  been  able  to  achieve
with the limited funds at their  disposal.  It  has,  I  believe,  certainly
contributed to the 12% decrease in the road  accident  figure  in  the  Free
State during the past Christmas season. It is indeed an achievement.]

That brings me to road and rail safety. South  Africa  is  currently  facing
the crisis of a very high rate of road accidents, injuries  and  fatalities.
This is a disease killing about 10 000 people  on  our  roads  annually  and
thousands more are injured and mutilated on our  roads,  costing  the  South
African economy approximately R4,2 billion per year.

Given the fact that information and statistics play such a critical role  in
strategic planning, management and  evaluation  of  policies,  it  was  very
disappointing to learn from a written reply by the Minister of Transport  to
a question put to him recently that the statistics in respect of fatal  road
accidents for 2002 will only be available towards the  middle  of  2003  and
that, due to  the  high  number  of  accidents  in  other  accident  groups,
information is collected only for fatal  accidents  and  no  information  is
currently available for the number  of  serious  injuries.  Without  a  good
diagnosis, a doctor cannot prescribe the correct medicine.  I  am,  however,
pleased that the hon Acting Minister has announced some mechanisms today  to
address this problem.

The New NP welcomes the announcement by the hon Acting Minister  today  that
the Rail Safety Regulator Act will hopefully be implemented soon.  Hopefully
this will enhance the safety of passengers on our trains. I  would  like  to
express  my  party's  disappointment  that  the  report  on  the  disastrous
Muldersvlei train accident has been released at such a late stage.  I  still
do not have it in my hands.

In my first speech in the debate on  this  Budget  Vote  in  this  House,  I
expressed my concerns about the medical and mental fitness  of  professional
drivers on our roads and I have requested the  hon  Minister  to  amend  the
current legislation  regarding  medical  testing  to  provide  for  stricter
medical testing. The hon Minister, in a written reply to a question  put  to
him, has informed me now that legislation to this effect is currently  being
developed. For that the New NP is very grateful.

My plea to the hon Acting Minister is to make provision in this  legislation
for a stipulation that only specifically  accredited  medical  practitioners
may conduct ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon Chair, Minister, my colleagues and distinguished  guests
from various provinces, I  rise  to  present  the  speech  or  statement  as
prepared for the chairperson of the standing committee in my  province  who,
due to unforeseen circumstances, could not find an hour to be here with us.

Before I start to present the needs of the people in terms of  transport  in
the North West, in this era of transformation  and  commuter  care,  I  must
indicate the situation on the taxi recap and the training of  taxi  drivers.
The first phase of this training was completed at the end of last year.  The
second phase is due to start shortly,  mid-year.  These  courses  are  TETA-
accredited.
In terms of public transport subsidies, to  date  all  subsidies  have  gone
well. However, there is the new challenge of having to revisit  the  subsidy
strategy due to a new rezoning approach in the bus industry on  some  routes
in the province. As our province is  mostly  rural,  the  bus  industry  has
scaled down its operations in some areas due to  the  scaling  down  of  the
industry itself. The rural commuters are therefore  dependent  on  the  taxi
industry to fill the gap left by the bus. This affects both the working  and
the nonworking classes.

About black economic empowerment, five  taxi  cooperatives  were  registered
with the Registrar  of  Cooperatives  last  year.  These  co-operatives  are
intended to empower  both  taxi  operators  and  drivers  economically.  The
Caltex fuel company has won the tender to supply fuel to the  taxi  industry
in  bulk.  The  industry  will  subsequently  purchase  fuel  cheaper  at  a
subsidised price.

In terms of the Arrive Alive campaign,  the  province  has  established  the
Road Safety Forum,  to  which  full-time  road  safety  officers  have  been
appointed  to  work  directly  with  the  forum  in  terms  of  facilitating
understanding with communities. The province set itself a target  last  year
to contribute  by  10%  to  the  national  Arrive  Alive  campaign  and  the
assessments is that it was achieved.

The general situation regarding testing stations is that most  of  them  are
in the process of being upgraded to meet the national standards  and  comply
with the SABS requirements.

I must also highlight that as far  as  the  Road  Accident  Fund  Commission
Report is concerned, the province has not assessed the report so far as  the
national department has direct access to the RAF.

About nonmotorised transport, the South African  Bureau  of  Standards,  the
SABS, is currently formulating specifications for the province  with  regard
to donkey carts. The guideline document is due for  completion  towards  the
middle of this year.

A number  of  1  350  bicycles  have  been  distributed  to  the  identified
deserving schools in the Bophirima district municipality by President  Thabo
Mbeki during his visit to the province following the  Imbizo  Week.  At  the
same time 1 200 bicycles are in the process  of  being  distributed  to  the
deserving schools in the  Kgalagadi  district  municipality.  This  exercise
will be completed at the beginning of June this year.

In conclusion, North West welcomes the Budget Vote. Thank you.

Mnr A J WILLIAMS: Dankie, Voorsitter. Ek wil die  agb  Minister  mnr  Radebe
bedank en gelukwens  met  die  doeltreffende  wyse  waarop  hy  waarneem  in
hierdie portefeulje. Die Wes-Kaap het groot  waardering  vir  die  reusetaak
wat u saam met u eie portefeulje het en wat u so suksesvol hanteer.

Die provinsie Wes-Kaap  het  onlangs  sy  mobiliteitstrategie  bekendgestel.
Hierdie geïntegreerde strategie tussen busse, treine en  minibus-taxi's  het
ten doel om volhoubare ontwikkeling te verseker en  om  die  lewenskwaliteit
van die inwoners van die provinsie te bevorder. Die  meeste  pendelaars  wat
van openbare vervoer gebruik maak,  is  van  die  arm,  voorheen  benadeelde
gemeenskappe. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr A J WILLIAMS: Thank you, Chairperson. I want to thank the hon  Minister,
Mr Radebe, and congratulate him on the effective way in which he  is  acting
in this portfolio. The Western Cape has great appreciation for the  gigantic
task that you have, together with your own  portfolio,  and  that  you  cope
with so successfully.

The Western Cape province has recently  introduced  its  mobility  strategy.
This integrated strategy between buses, trains and  minibus-taxis  is  aimed
at ensuring sustainable development and promoting the  quality  of  life  of
the residents of this province. Most of the commuters who are  using  public
transport are from the poor, previously disadvantaged communities.]

For most people in our province transport is expensive  and  time-consuming.
For many it is also unpleasant and unsafe. It is  also  costly  to  society.
Accidents,  congestion  and  environmental  destruction  waste  our   social
resources. Apartheid policies, which segregated people  on  racial  grounds,
created settlement patterns  that  were  grossly  inefficient  and  unequal.
This, Chair, imposed poverty, dependence and  high  costs  on  poor  people.
Trapped in a cycle of poverty, many  people  were  denied  access  to  basic
resources.

Improving the transport system  means  creating  a  viable,  affordable  and
sustainable transport system for everybody. Transport  policy  and  strategy
must therefore change the way things were done in  the  past  and  to  bring
about major improvements in both urban and rural areas.

Chair, to make sure that this happens, any mobility strategy we  start  must
be related not only to producing the  distribution  of  land-use  activities
but must also help to create jobs, reduce poverty,  make  the  best  use  of
available transport resources in an integrated transport strategy, and  lead
to the empowerment of our people.

The planned development of the  Klipfontein  corridor  will  truly  lead  to
empowerment of those who were economically neglected in the past.

Verkeersbestuur  ressorteer  in   die   Wes-Kaap   onder   die   departement
gemeenskapsveiligheid, en daar is 'n noue skakel tussen die ministeries  van
gemeenskapsveiligheid, en vervoer  en  openbare  werke  sowel  as  die  twee
staande komitees van daardie twee ministeries om van ons verkeersbestuur  'n
sukses te  maak  in  ons  provinsie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[In the Western Cape traffic management falls  under  the  community  safety
department, and there is a close link between the  ministries  of  community
safety, transport and public works, as well as the two  standing  committees
of those two ministries, to make a success  of  traffic  management  in  our
province.]

Public transport is a basic need for a very large proportion of the  Western
Cape community, because low-income levels, and in many cases  dire  poverty,
do not provide these communities any alternatives to  the  public  transport
service available to them. In the city of Cape Town, where some 80%  of  the
population of the province reside, a low car-ownership rate means  that  56%
of persons depend on the public transport for work  and  other  trips.  This
translates into almost 500 000 persons travelling to and from work daily  by
means of public transport.

Minibus-taxi operators deliver much of the public transport being  provided,
and, in the case of rural areas, nearly all  public  transport.  Partnership
agreements have been concluded by the city of Cape Town and  in  some  other
municipalities in order to join and implement projects, carry out  statutory
planning and  manage  and  provide  operational  projects.  To  support  the
efforts of the road infrastructure branch and to meet  the  requirements  of
the Batho  Pele  principle,  the  branch  has  developed  a  key  measurable
objective management system, the KMOMS, that contains details of  about  120
key measurable objectives developed  to  measure  service  delivery  in  the
respective 29 branch priority programmes.

The measurement of  this  delivery,  through  the  KMOMS,  is  a  continuous
process undertaken by the management of the road infrastructure  branch  and
serves as the basis of progress reports required by provincial treasury  and
the provincial cabinet.

The major achievement during 2002-03 was the  transformation  that  occurred
with the roads infrastructure branch. This transformation  is  reflected  in
the mission statement that changed  from  being  product-orientated  to  one
that  emphasises  the  importance  of  a  process  that  is  socially  just,
developmental and empowering.
With an allocation of R55,27 million, only 40% of the need for  regravelling
of the gravel roads could be  met.  Of  the  R79,68  million  available  for
resealing, only 45% of the need could be met. The amount of  R83,15  million
was made available for routine maintenance activities on gravel  roads,  and
only 39% of the needs on roads could be met in this regard.

Madam Chair, R89,95 million was allocated for  the  maintenance  of  service
roads in the province, which enabled the branch to  meet  only  60%  of  the
need. Government motor transport introduced the 24-hour report  line  in  an
effort to curb fraud and misuse of government vehicles.  A  special  project
was launched to update and to  keep  track  of  the  transport  officers  to
enable  better   communication.   A   strategic   planning   and   extensive
consultation process led to the publication of its visionary  delivery  plan
for  2002-2007,  which  gained  acceptance  by   the   province,   all   the
municipalities  in  the  province  and  stakeholders  affected  by  the  new
direction to be taken in terms of the new policy.

The vision of the delivery plan takes forward existing  programmes,  one  of
which is the  transformation  of  the  minibus-taxi  industry  into  a  more
formally  structured  operating  sector.  This  involves  the   transitional
intervention of the Be Legal Campaign, in terms of which some 1 500  illegal
operators were granted operating licences.  Another  achievement  this  year
was the appointment of the  new  provincial  appointing  licence  board,  an
independent body  established  in  terms  of  the  National  Land  Transport
Transition Act.

In line with the intent to deliver a  people-friendly  Batho  Pele  approach
when interacting with  the  public-transport  industry,  major  improvements
were made to the Goldburn Centre at a cost of some R10 million. This is  the
provincial office where applications by  operators  for  operating  licences
and registrations are  made.  Regarding  the  Community-Based  Public  Works
Programme, the department was  successful  in  obtaining  an  allocation  of
R46,16 million from the allocation for poverty alleviation in structure  and
job summit projects.

Madam Chair, of the R46,16 million an  amount  of  R44,91  million  was  set
aside for the Community Access Road Programme, and  R1,25  million  for  the
Community-Based  Road  Maintenance  Programme.  The  Community  Access  Road
Programme  broadly  encompasses  the  construction  of  municipal   streets,
sidewalks and access to road services for marginalised  communities  in  the
five district municipalities that we have in our  province.  These  projects
presented opportunities to reduce unemployment by creating  productive  jobs
and opportunities  for  affirmative  business  enterprises,  the  ABEs,  the
creation of assets of an appropriate quality by  incorporating  construction
methods and encouraging the employment of local labour at ABEs.

In order to complete these projects within the communities,  the  department
provided training and transferred  skills  to  unemployed  people  and  ABEs
involved in the  projects,  to  improve  their  chances  of  becoming  self-
employed and entering the formal  economy  after  the  completion  of  these
projects.

Madam Chair, to ensure the ongoing alleviation of  poverty,  the  department
provided  members  of  the  community  with  the  opportunity  for   ongoing
employment opportunities, after the creation of initial  assets  by  way  of
the Community-Based Road Maintenance  Programme.  These  projects  presented
opportunities to develop the capacity  of  communities  through  the  direct
participation in the development of the projects.
We in the Western Cape are committed to root out the evil of poverty in  the
province. I thank you. [Applause.]

The ANC's policy around transport is informed by the needs for transport  to
support Government's social and economic development objectives.  Transport,
whether by road, rail, sea, or air, is the backbone of our economy,  because
it carries people  to  and  from  work,  move  products  from  producers  to
markets, and offer affordable movement to mostly poor people to enable  them
to access social services such as health care and education.

For transport to fulfil this important  social  function,  it  is  essential
that it be underpinned by a clear  vision  and  an  appropriate  policy  and
legislative framework. Our  vision,  articulated  in  the  RDP  and  further
elaborated in the White Paper on Transport on  Moving  South  Africa,  calls
for a transport system that  will  provide  safe,  reliable,  effective  and
efficient, and fully integrated  transport  operations  and  infrastructures
that will best meet  the  needs  of  communities  and  improving  levels  of
service and cost in  a  fashion  that  supports  Government  strategies  for
social  and   economic   development   while   being   environmentally   and
economically sustainable.

When we assumed power, we inherited a transport system  that  was  in  sharp
contrast with the one contained in our vision  above.  It  was  a  transport
system characterised by the absence of proper  roads  in  townships,  severe
backlogs in road maintenance, deterioration of rail  and  bus  services  for
commuters and rural people, inadequate regulations of the taxi industry  and
ignorance of  the  country's  outrageous  road  safety  record.  Given  this
legacy, it was never going to be an easy task  to  transform  our  transport
system to one that is responsive to the needs of the vast majority  of  poor
people. Neither could it be accomplished in a short space of time.

Indeed, in our first few years of democracy, the focus was on a  painstaking
process of internal restructuring and the development of  new  policies  and
strategies. It is these new policies and strategies that have now  laid  the
foundation for us to begin to accelerate the implementation  of  our  vision
for transport in this country. A number of daunting  challenges  are  facing
us in implementing our vision. I want to focus on just a few of them.

That is the taxi recap, and I think a lot of members have spoken about  this
issue. The taxi recap process is a recognition on the part  of  the  ANC  of
the important role that the taxi industry plays in our national economy.  We
believe the taxi industry should take  its  rightful  place  in  our  public
transport industry, because 65% of South Africans  are  transported  by  the
taxi industry.

Sizokhumbula ukuthi abantu abashayela  amatekisi  besibabiza  ngosomatekisi.
Yilo Hulumeni wethu we-ANC owabona ukuthi akusilo igama  elehla  kahle  lelo
ukuthi bangosomatekisi.  Yikho-ke  sesibabiza  ngokuthi  abantu  abakwi-taxi
industry.
Kuqala  bebethathwa   njengabantu   abafana   noskhotheni,   bengahlonishwa.
UHulumeni ka-ANC nguye oze wabuyisa isithunzi sabo ukuthi  sibe  sendleleni.
(Translation of isiZulu paragraphs follows.)

[We will remember that we used to call taxi drivers ``osomatekisi''.  It  is
our ANC Government who realised that this name was not acceptable, and  that
is why we now refer to them as people in the taxi industry.

Previously they were not respected, they were regarded  as  vandals.  It  is
the ANC Government that has restored their dignity.]

The key advantage of the recapitalisation process includes  improved  safety
and efficiency, since the vehicle specifications are designed for  passenger
safety and comfort, electronic fare collection, which improves  the  ability
to generate tax revenue from the billions generated by the stability in  the
industry. It will also create considerable opportunities for black  economic
empowerment in the various sectors that supply and service the industry.  An
important objective of  the  recap  is  to  help  advance  and  achieve  the
property development investment and ownership  aims  of  the  South  African
National Taxi Council.

In this regard the ANC is pleased  to  note  that  the  R8  billion  project
between SANTACO  empowerment  property  development,  group  taxi  prop  and
construction group Basil Read will begin  in  September  2003.  I  say  this
noting the concerns that have been raised by  SANTACO  with  regard  to  the
slowness of our process. As  Government  was  saying,  we  are  prepared  to
address their problem as a collective. This  joint  venture  will  transform
existing taxi and bus ranks into diversified retail and service outlets.

These transport hubs will offer facilities  like  retail  stores,  financial
and  banking  facilities,  medical  clinics,  community   centres,   vehicle
dealerships and other motor-related services.  In  other  words,  they  will
offer commuters the convenience of retail stores and retailers access  to  a
concentrated  market.  It  will  also  include  lock-up  market  kiosks  for
hawkers. Given the  significant  contribution  this  process  will  make  in
realising and unlocking the economic potential of the taxi industry,  it  is
essential that the interdepartmental processes  that  are  currently  taking
place be accelerated.
I will touch a bit on road safety. The ANC applauds  Government's  increased
emphasis on the safety issues  in  all  transport  modes.  The  Road  Safety
Strategy, new regulations that are on the transportation of dangerous  goods
by road, the establishment of the Marine Rescue Centre, the  setting  up  to
the Rail Safety Regulator and the Road Traffic Management  Corporation,  are
excellent examples of this commitment to create a safe transport system.  If
I may just say ...

KwaZulu-Natali umhlonishwa uSbu Ndebele unohlelo olubizwa ngokuthi  ``Yomela
Ngasekhaya.'' [In KwaZulu-Natal the hon Sbu Ndebele has a  programme  called
``Quench your thirst at home''.]

He advertises that slogan on the glasses, which simply means:

Noma sewome kangakanani, ungalingi uwuphuze ubhiya wakho.  Linda  uze  ufike
ekhaya, ungaphuzi emgwaqweni. [No matter how thirsty you are, do  not  drink
your beer while you are on the road. Wait until you are home.]

Since 1994 we have developed a  comprehensive  road  traffic  safety  system
through an integrated approach which includes safety  aspects  ranging  from
driver and  vehicle  certification  and  testing,  road  signage,  road-user
education and traffic law enforcement.  They  have  also  secured  passenger
safety even further through the speed limit for  public  transport  vehicles
such as buses having  been  lowered  to  100km/h.  The  major  strategy  for
combating road accidents is  more  effective  law  enforcement.  This  means
physical detention and prosecution of road traffic offenders  and  increased
maximum fines.

However, this needs to be combined with the broader  pro-active  strategies,
which will enhance compliance with road traffic rules. The main  reason  for
this is that the effectiveness of  enforcement-based  strategies  to  modify
road-use behaviour is dependent on there being a perception that there is  a
real possibility that breaches will be detected. [Time expired.]

The ACTING MINISTER OF TRANSPORT: Chairperson, I really appreciate  all  the
members who participated in this debate and I am sure that as  a  Department
we will incorporate many of the suggestions that were made  in  this  Budget
Vote. I want to respond to some of the issues that have been raised.

Firstly, on the issue  of  emergency  exits  for  public  vehicles,  in  the
aftermath of the Bethlehem  accident  where  51  of  our  people  died,  the
department has  commissioned  the  South  African  Bureau  of  Standards  to
undertake  a  detailed  study  on  emergency  exits.  We  have  already  had
preliminary discussions with the SABS and we  look  forward  to  a  detailed
report and guidelines in due course.

It is also important to add that the  department  is  also  looking  at  the
adequacy of emergency services. The department will  also  be  commissioning
an audit to determine the nature, location  and  availability  of  emergency
support services when accidents occur on our roads.

On the issue  of  the  points  demerit  system  for  public  transport,  the
Department  of  Transport  has  taken  note  of  all  requests  by   several
stakeholders, including this House,  for  the  introduction  of  the  points
demerit system as part of the regime to improve public transport services.

It is also part of the new  bus  tendering  system  which  introduces  these
sanctioning measures to  ensure  that  operators  recognise  the  fact  that
safety is non-negotiable. Similarly with the introduction  of  new  vehicles
as part of the taxi recap  programme  the  Department  will  include  safety
standards to ensure that any operator who does not adhere to minimum  safety
standards will forfeit their  operator's  permit  as  part  of  this  points
demerit system.

On issues that have been raised especially  by  the  Northern  Cape  on  the
issue of provincial road funding, the department is engaged  in  discussions
with the National  Treasury  on  inadequate  funding  for  road  maintenance
rehabilitation and further development. One of the proposals that is on  the
table is  the  consolidation  of  the  Municipal  Infrastructure  Grant  and
increasing the total allocation for purposes of ensuring better  maintenance
of all provincial roads.

Secondly, as part of the new five-year road plan  that  I  mentioned  in  my
earlier comments, a joint task team involving  the  national  Department  of
Transport, the National Treasury and road departments in all  provinces  has
been established  to  provide  a  better  coordination  of  efforts  in  the
management of public transport infrastructure. The  entire  Government  must
acknowledge this problem in the area of road funding and  we  are  committed
to bringing about substantial improvements in this regard.

I want to ensure and assure this House that all these requests will  receive
high priority. I may add as well  that  the  Roads  Agency,  SANRAL,  as  an
agency of the Department of  Transport,  will  also  be  assisting  in  many
provinces to ensure that the question of road maintenance is dealt with  and
also taking over certain of the portions of road when it is economic  to  do
so.

On the progress of taxi recap,  members  will  recall  that  this  programme
consists of two processes: the Electronic  Management  System  and  the  new
taxi vehicles. With regards to  EMS,  which  is  the  Electronic  Management
System, we are in the process of finalising  a  tender  evaluation  and  the
recommendation will come to Cabinet soon.

On the new taxi vehicles, I must indicate to this House that  the  best  and
final offer, the so-called Bafo document, has been issued  on  21  May  2003
and as soon as this process is  concluded,  a  decision  will  be  taken  by
Cabinet.
On the Road Accident Fund,  there  have  been  fraudulent  claims  for  road
accidents that have been submitted to the RAF. While this RAF embarked on  a
strategy to clamp down on fraudulent claims,  the  Department  of  Transport
appointed a commission of inquiry to make recommendations  with  respect  to
the whole system and improve procedure by the RAF to verify the validity  of
claims  and  to  investigate  suspect  claims.  This  has   already   proved
successful as a number of corrupt attorneys and employees,  as  members  are
aware, are being exposed and prosecuted.

The commission of inquiry has released its report, as we may  be  aware,  in
December of last year and it  contains  several  recommendations.  The  core
thrust of these recommendations is that this fund should be replaced with  a
new system of compensation for victims.  Many  of  the  recommendations  are
being taken up in revised  legislation  to  be  finalised  but,  of  course,
consultation with all relevant stakeholders will  ensure  that  we  will  be
able to take people on board.

On the issue of the bicycle project, the  so-called  Shova  Kalula  project,
the question was  why  it  had  been  delayed.  When  the  first  phase  was
completed, the department initiated evaluation of phase one of  the  bicycle
project in order to measure the successes as well as the failures.

Both these successes and failures were meant to be considered in the  design
of the second and third phases. The  evaluation  exercise  involved  various
visitations to each of the eleven sites in the  seven  provinces  where  the
project was launched. The second reason contributing to  the  delay  has  to
with the development of tender specification for the supply and  maintenance
of the shops as well as the bicycles themselves.

In developing these specifications, the department had to interact with  the
SABS in ensuring  that  its  tender  specifications  are  aligned  with  the
bicycle norms and standards based on the comments that were received. So  as
a result, tender specifications had to be redone.

Based on the lessons of this evaluation, the decision was taken to  separate
the component for the supply of bicycles and the management of  shops.  This
meant that two tender specifications had to be redeveloped in  this  regard.
Because the bicycle project is a joint venture between  the  department  and
provinces,  it   was   important   that   consultation   on   these   tender
specifications was  done  and  deliberated  upon  with  provinces  who  have
indicated strong support and interest in gaining the strategic  control  and
ownership of the project. This has also contributed to the delay.

Right now, there is a memorandum of understanding that is  being  negotiated
between the department and the provinces. As  soon  as  this  memorandum  of
understanding has been completed and the business plan  concluded  with  the
provinces, funds will be transferred to the provinces so that  we  can  move
to the last phase.

On the issue of BEE, the Department of  Transport  has  made  much  progress
with regards to BEE through, in particular, the bus tender system. In  spite
of the moratorium on the issuing of  bus  tenders,  especially  in  KwaZulu-
Natal, the majority of subsidised bus services are  operated,  in  fact,  by
historically  disadvantaged  individuals.  The  MinCom  decided  that   this
process should be expedited and in order to achieve  this,  it  was  decided
that in future 30% of all tenders will be set  aside  for  the  historically
disadvantaged and provision  will  also  be  made  for  a  further  10%  for
subcontracting.
The  Department  of  Transport  is  aware  of  the  challenges  of  economic
empowerment and there is also a concurrent process  of  developing  the  BEE
Charter for the  transport  sector.  We  are  in  a  process  of  consulting
stakeholders and hopefully before the end of August 2003  the  charter  will
be available.

With those comments, Chair, I would like to take this opportunity  to  thank
all the hon members for their constructive and useful comments.  As  I  have
indicated, we will act upon many  of  the  comments  that  have  been  made.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon Minister, thank you very much  and
thanks to all the special delegates. We want to  thank  you  sincerely,  hon
Minister, for the work that you are doing on behalf of  your  colleague  hon
Dullah Omar. We say,  keep  the  home  fires  burning.  Siyabonga  Bhungane.
[Thank you, Bhungane.]

                            BANKS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Ms C-S BOTHA: Chairperson, colleagues, the  most  substantive  amendment  to
the Banks Act is to the powers of the Registrar of  Banks  to  ensure  sound
corporate governance. But perhaps  the  most  interesting  aspect  for  this
Council are the changes to the gender-insensitive provisions  of  the  Banks
Act of 1990.

Members of this Council may remember the efforts of the chairperson  of  the
Select Committee on  Finance,  who  tried  to  have  the  gender-insensitive
terminology of the Act changed in 2000 already. The debate was taken to  the
Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of Quality of Life and  Status  of
Women, whence it was brought directly to the Minister of Finance.

Our objections were not successful, and it is only now that the  terminology
in the Act - which referred only to close relatives in relation  to  a  man,
namely his spouse, child, stepchild, parent or step-parent and,  furthermore
confined the business of a bank only to the use of the male  pronoun  -  has
been amended.

By themselves these linguistic issues may not seem to be of huge  importance
and were certainly not viewed as such by the Treasury in  2000,  but  it  is
the mindset  that  could  write  important  legislation  in  terms  of  male
references and perspectives only, that caused the relegation of women to  an
inferior position in earlier times and reinforced the  notion  that  men  be
viewed as the  guardians  of  women,  even  when  women  had  reached  their
majority or were married,  particularly  in  relation  to  banking  matters.
Therefore the present changes are symbolic of a  much  bigger  debate.  They
confirm that women are, as a matter of course, the legal equals  of  men  in
whatever capacity they operate.

The Bill also provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  compliance  function
within  banks.  It  requires  banks  to  establish  and  maintain   adequate
processes  of  sound  corporate  governance  which,  in  relation   to   the
management of a bank or a controlling company, now includes all  structures,
processes, policies, systems and procedures in terms  of  which  a  bank  or
controlling company is governed and in terms of which the term  ``director''
is defined to include an executive director and nonexecutive director.

The proposed amendment has not only imposed a duty  of  care  and  skill  on
each director but extends  such  duties  to  chief  executive  officers  and
executive officers of banks and bank controlling companies. The  House  will
well remember that these procedures were not in place  when  we  were  faced
with  the  Saambou  problem.  The  amendment  clarifies   the   common   law
uncertainty relating to the test applicable to the determination of  whether
or not the duty has been discharged.

The proposed amendment makes it clear that the company, as  opposed  to  the
shareholders, is the beneficiary of the statutory fiduciary  duty  and  duty
of care and skill, and grants certain powers to the registrar for breach  of
action. These new powers will allow  the  registrar  to  fulfil  a  powerful
function in protecting the interests of depositors.

It is noted in the memorandum that no specific meaning  has  been  given  to
date, or is likely to be given in future, to  the  term  ``fiduciary  duty''
but rests on the perception of the community of what constitutes  acceptable
conduct or breach of such, and changes over time.

The amendments also extend the powers  of  the  registrar  to  object  to  a
proposed appointment of a director, whilst making the necessary  distinction
between executive and  nonexecutive  members,  the  latter  being  appointed
under the Companies Act, while the former are subject to the various  labour
laws.

I request, on behalf of the Select Committee on  Finance,  support  for  the
passing of the Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

                          INSURANCE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Dr E A CONROY:  Hon  Chairperson  and  colleagues,  following  an  intensive
review of the administration, implementation and efficacy of  the  Long-Term
Insurance Act of 1998 and the Short-Term Insurance Act of 1998, the Bill  on
the table today, namely the Insurance Amendment Bill, has been  designed  to
update and consolidate the insurance  industry's  legislative  framework  in
terms of internationally accepted principles and best practice.
Some of the amendments are identical to the relevant sections of both  Acts,
while others are specific to either  the  Long-Term  Insurance  Act  or  the
Short-Term Insurance Act. In the  first  instance,  the  definition  of  the
``managing executive'' of insurance companies is  expanded  to  include  not
only the chief executive officers and the  executive  management,  but  also
senior managers who report directly to the CEO, as it is desirable,  from  a
regulatory viewpoint, that both the CEO and the manager reporting to him  or
her be fit and proper persons and that the term  ``fit  and  proper''  apply
not only to a person but also to the top management of a long-term insurer.

Other new definitions also became necessary  to  bring  the  definitions  of
certain words in line with those commonly used in  accounting  practice.  An
example  is  the  term  ``fair  value''  to  replace  ``market  value''   in
accordance  with   international   accounting   standards.   Other   amended
definitions cater  for  provisions  on  the  financial  soundness  valuation
method in respect of assets, liabilities and capital  adequacy  requirements
for long-term insurers.

The amendments to the said Acts are quite comprehensive, and it will not  be
possible to cover them all in the limited  time  at  my  disposal.  I  will,
therefore, only refer to the more salient amendments.

As far as the  regulation  of  advertising  material  related  to  insurance
policies is concerned, the relevant subsection is expanded  to  ensure  that
advertising material in a long-term insurance policy includes  the  name  of
the long-term underwriting insurer. The amendment is a  measure  to  prevent
persons from carrying on unregistered insurance business and to  afford  the
public an opportunity to verify the contents  of  the  advertising  material
with the particular long-term insurer. The registrar may direct a person  to
either cease publishing  or  abstain  from  publishing  certain  advertising
material if such material is misleading or contrary to the public interest.

Furthermore,  the  requirement  that  the  registrar's  prior  approval   be
obtained if a long-term insurer wishes to change its name,  is  expanded  to
include the requirement  to  obtain  the  registrar's  approval  also  if  a
translation, shortened form or derivative of the insurer's name is  changed.
The amendment became necessary as the registrar  has  to  determine  whether
the planned changes to the name are acceptable and to enable  the  registrar
to keep records of any such changes.

It is also essential to prevent  a  long-term  insurer  from  using  a  name
closely related to the name of another  insurer,  as  this  may  create  and
promote confusion and uncertainty amongst prospective clients.

At present the registrar must be notified whenever  directors  and  managing
executives of long-term insurers are appointed  or  their  appointments  are
terminated. This requirement is expanded to also cover cases in  which  such
persons resign their positions, and it  enables  the  registrar  to  request
further  information  from  directors  and  managing  executives  who   have
resigned, or whose appointments have been terminated in  circumstances  that
may prejudice the relevant insurer's ability to comply with  the  provisions
of the Act.

As such resignations and terminations of appointments may be the  result  of
irregular circumstances in an insurer's internal affairs, which might  cause
the interests of policy holders and other stakeholders to be at risk, it  is
necessary for information thereon to be given or to be available as soon  as
possible.

Section 26 of the Long-Term Insurance Act, 1998, imposes limitations on  the
control  and  the  holding  of  shares  and  other  interests  in  long-term
insurers. To widen the net  of  such  restrictions  and  to  avoid  indirect
frustration of the  objectives  sought  to  be  achieved  by  that  section,
limitations are also imposed on  certain  associates  of  persons  primarily
vested with such rights  and  interests.  The  expression  ``associate''  is
replaced by the term ``related party'' and is necessary in order to be  more
closely in line with and  to  avoid  misinterpretation  with  South  African
Statements of Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.

Section 44(1) of the Long-Term Insurance Act states that  a  person  who  is
required to provide a policy or policy benefits as security  for  a  certain
transaction, must be given a free  choice  regarding  certain  matters.  The
amendment excludes policy loans from the said  requirements  and  will  only
apply in a case in which the long-term insurer lends  money  to  the  holder
of, and upon the security  of,  a  long-term  policy  taken  out  with  that
insurer. The giving of policy loans is  a  long-standing  practice  and  has
become a standard commercial feature and facility of long-term policies.

It is a requirement of the Act that where a  premium  is  paid  in  cash,  a
receipt, which contains  certain  information  including  the  name  of  the
insurance company, the policy number and the details of  the  recipient,  be
issued. As the current banking systems do not make provision for a  bank  to
state the names of the  insurance  company  and  of  the  policy  holder  in
receipts, banks are continually in breach of that requirement.

The  section  envisages  protecting  particularly  the  less   sophisticated
segment of the market in which  premiums  are  paid  in  cash  to  a  person
collecting them on a frequent basis. As enough protection is built into  the
current banking system to safeguard a policy holder paying the  premiums  in
cash to a bank, banks will be excluded from the relevant requirements.

Listed securities and shares issued by a foreign government  or  institution
will be regarded as an asset in the Republic which long-term  insurers  must
hold, if the registrar has recognised the stock exchange or the  country  in
which a regulated market exists.

A few aspects of the  amendment  proposals  are  formal  and  textual,  but,
essentially, the proposals mean that  the  relevant  assets  will  still  be
regarded as assets in the Republic.  However,  the  stock  exchange  or  the
country within which a regulated market exists shall no  longer  be  subject
to recognition by the registrar.

Investing in a recognised  stock  exchange  or  in  a  country  in  which  a
regulated market exists is not necessarily a guarantee that this will  be  a
good  investment.  The  amendments  will  have  the  effect   that   greater
responsibility will be  placed  on  the  directors  of  long-term  insurance
companies to assess the risks in investing in foreign  stock  exchanges  and
regulated markets.

That is  the  Insurance  Amendment  Bill  in  a  nutshell,  albeit  a  large
nutshell. I request  the  House,  on  behalf  of  the  Select  Committee  on
Finance, for  its  support  in  the  passing  of  the  Bill.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

           BOPHUTHATSWANA NATIONAL PROVIDENT FUND ACT REPEAL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr T RALANE: Chairperson and colleagues, actuaries were  appointed  to  take
over the administration of the Bophuthatswana  National  Provident  Fund  to
establish financial and administrative control. The Bophuthatswana  National
Provident Fund was converted into a privately administered  provident  fund.
The new fund was registered with the Registrar  of  Pension  Funds  Act  and
Income Tax Act.

In light of the  above,  this  Bill  seeks  to:  Firtsly,  disestablish  the
Bophuthatswana National Provident Fund; secondly, transfer  the  assets  and
liabilities of the Bohuthatswana National Provident Fund to Bosele  National
Provident; and thirdly, repeal the Bophuthatswana  National  Provident  Fund
Act of 1979.

All affected stakeholders were consulted  and  the  Bill  has  no  financial
implications for Government. The  Select  Committee  on  Finance  recommends
that this House supports this Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes  the  debate.  I  shall
now put the question. The question  is  that  the  Bill  be  agreed  to.  In
accordance  with  Rule  63  I  shall  first  allow  political  parties   the
opportunity to make their declaration of vote if they so wish. We shall  now
proceed to the voting on the question. Those in  favour  will  say  ``Aye'',
those against ``No''.

HON MEMBERS: Aye!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  The  majority  of  members  voted  in
favour. I therefore declare the Bill agreed  to  in  terms  of  section  75.
[Applause.]

           SEFALANA EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ORGANISATION ACT REPEAL BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

Mr  T  RALANE:  Chair  and  hon  members,  the  Sefalana  Employee  Benefits
Organisation, widely known as SEBO, was established  by  section  2  of  the
Sefalana Employees Benefits Organisation Act  of  1989.  The  functions  and
objectives of SEBO were to operate and control each of  the  following  five
funds: Bophuthatswana Government Service Pension Fund; Bophuthatswana  Super
Annuation Fund; Bophuthatswana Unemployment Insurance  Fund;  Bophuthatswana
Accident Fund; and Bophuthatswana National Provident Fund.

The first two of these funds were amalgamated into the Government  Employees
Pension Fund in terms of the provisions of Government Employees Pension  Law
with  effect  from  1  May  1996.  The  National  Treasury,  following   the
amalgamation absorbed 39 former SEBO  employees  into  the  department.  The
remaining two funds were transferred to the Department  of  Labour  and  the
compensation commissioner respectively. The fifth and  remaining  fund,  the
Bophuthatswana National Provident  Fund,  was  converted  into  a  privately
administered provident fund registered  with  the  Registration  of  Pension
Funds in terms of section 4 of the Pension Funds Act of 1956.

A Bill seeking to repeal the Bophuthatswana National Provident Fund  Act  of
1979 is also before this House. The effect of these changes  is  that  there
is nothing left for Sefalana Employees Benefits Organisation Act of 1989  to
administer and  the  Act  is  still  in  force.  This  Bill  thus  seeks  to
disestablish SEBO and to repeal the said Act.

The Select Committee on Finance recommends that  this  House  supports  this
section 75 Bill. Thank you. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes  the  debate.  I  shall
now put the question. The question  is  that  the  Bill  be  agreed  to.  In
accordance with Rule 63 I shall allow political parties the  opportunity  to
make their declaration of vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to  the
voting on the question. Those in favour will say Aye.

HON MEMBERS: Aye!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Those against,  ``No''.  The  ``Ayes''
have it. The majority of members voted in favour. I  therefore  declare  the
Bill agreed to in terms of section 75 of the Constitution.

              FILLING OF VACANCIES ON NATIONAL YOUTH COMMISSION

  (Consideration of Report of Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of
     Quality of Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As there is no speakers' list I  shall
now put the question. The question is that the report  be  adopted.  As  the
decision is dealt with in terms of section 65 of the Constitution,  I  shall
first ascertain whether all the delegation heads are present in the  Chamber
to cast their provinces' vote. Are all the delegation heads present?

In accordance with Rule 71 I shall first allow provinces the opportunity  to
make their declaration of vote if they so wish. We shall now proceed to  the
voting on the question. I shall do so in alphabetical  order  per  province.
Delegations heads please indicate to the Chair whether they vote in  favour,
or against or abstain from voting. Eastern Cape?
