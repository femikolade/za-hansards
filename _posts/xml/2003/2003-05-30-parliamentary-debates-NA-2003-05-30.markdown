                          CAPE TOWN UNICITY BUDGET

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs R R JOEMAT (ANC): Madam Speaker, Cape  Town  mayor,  Nomaindia  Mfeketo,
announced average rate and tariff increases of 9% in her  budget  speech  on
28 May 2003. A large portion of this percentage will be  redirected  towards
upgrading informal settlements. The council has also set aside R344  million
to address the housing backlog, and a further R45 million will  be  used  to
convert same-sex hostels into family units. A further R105 million has  been
set aside to build proper access roads, and  to  deliver  water,  sanitation
and electricity.

The ANC welcomes the Cape Town unicity budget. We believe that  this  budget
marks a decisive leap forward towards integrated communities. [Applause.]

                      THE ANC GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mnr S E OPPERMAN (DA): Mevrou die Speaker,  die  jongste  kapingsvoorval  en
moord op 'n inwoner van Mitchell's Plain in  AZ  Berman  Rylaan  is  nie  'n
uitsonderlike voorval nie. Kapings,  moorde  en  verkragtings  het  endemies
geword.

Misdadigers ontvang, met die komplimente van die  staat,  en  by  implikasie
van die slagoffers, toegang tot die beste regshulp. Halssnoermoordenaars  en
verkragters ontvang die  beste  maatskaplike  berading,  die  beste  mediese
versorging, die beste studiemateriaal van hulle keuse - alles ten koste  van
wetsgehoorsame burgers. Hulle hoef geen hande-arbeid te  verrig  nie.  Hulle
hoef nie slagoffers te vergoed nie. Hulle ly nooit  honger  nie.  Hulle  het
toegang tot die media en tot die beste ontspanningsfasiliteite. Sommige  het
selfs toegang tot hulle seksmaats buite die gevangenis.

Waarom is ons verbaas  dat  tronke  oorvol  is?  As  ons  die  voordele  van
misdadigers in hierdie land  vergelyk  met  dié  van  miljoene  spartelende,
wetsgehoorsame burgers, is  dit  duidelik  dat  die  waardesisteme  van  die
huidige Regering in totale chaos verkeer. Geen wonder  Afrika  staan  op  sy
kop in die voorportaal van ons Parlement nie.  Noord  is  Suid  en  Suid  is
Noord, Oos is  Wes  en  Wes  is  Oos.  Ons  aardbolle  draai  in  allerhande
windrigtings. Elkeen is met die  wind  gepla.  Geen  wonder  dat  daar  geen
rigting is in die hantering van  krisisse  waarmee  ons  land  gekonfronteer
word nie.

Daar heers totale verwarring in ons land, waar  losbandigheid  sinoniem  met
vryheid  geword  het.  Die   ANC   Regering   het   die   wetlike   reg   en
verantwoordelikheid om die land, vir wie se vryheid baie van ons  baie  hard
geveg het, reeds verloor. Die skrif is aan die  muur.  Hierdie  Regering  is
geweeg en  te  lig  bevind.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  [Applous.]  (Translation  of
Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Mr S E OPPERMAN (DA): Madam Speaker, the most recent hijacking  and  murder
of a resident of Mitchell's Plain in AZ Berman  Drive  is  not  an  isolated
incident. Hijackings, murders and rapes have become endemic.

Criminals receive, with the compliments of the state and by implication  the
victims, access to  the  best  legal  aid.  Necklace-murderers  and  rapists
receive the  best  counselling,  the  best  medical  care,  the  best  study
materials of their choice - all at  the  expense  of  law-abiding  citizens.
They do not need  to  perform  any  manual  labour.  They  do  not  need  to
compensate victims. They never go hungry. They have access to the media  and
the best recreational facilities. Some of them even  have  access  to  their
sexual partners outside prison.

Why are we surprised  that  prisons  are  overcrowded?  If  we  compare  the
benefits of criminals in this country with those of millions of  struggling,
law-abiding citizens, it is clear that the  value  systems  of  the  present
Government is in total chaos. No wonder Africa is standing on  its  head  in
the entrance hall of our Parliament. North is  South  and  South  is  North,
East is West and  West  is  East.  Our  globes  rotate  in  every  direction
imaginable. Everybody is  plagued  by  the  wind.  No  wonder  there  is  no
guidance with regard to coping with crises that confront our country.

Total confusion prevails in our country,  where  permissiveness  has  become
synonymous with freedom. The ANC  Government  has  already  lost  the  legal
right to and responsibility towards the country, for whose freedom  many  of
us have fought very hard. The writing is on the wall.  This  Government  has
been weighed and found wanting. [Interjections.] [Applause.]]

                     SIX-MEMBER PANEL OF EMINENT PERSONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs I MARS (IFP): Madam Speaker, the formal  establishment  of  the  African
Union in 2002 brought with it a new optimism that the  continent  of  Africa
would finally be able to effectively address its  myriad  of  problems  that
have historically bedevilled peace, stability, economic  growth  and  social
development. One of the cornerstones of the new African Union is that it  is
expected to play a much more proactive role  in  promoting  peace,  security
and good governance. Furthermore, in conjunction with the  creation  of  the
African Union, African  leaders  have  drawn  up  a  comprehensive  plan  to
address the continent's problems.

Nepad essentially contains the promises and commitments of  African  leaders
to the developed world in order to gain  access  to  developmental  funding,
donor funding and other forms of assistance. But global  reality  determines
that the most developed and rich countries in the world will not  provide  a
massive injection of finance into Africa if it is not met  by  a  commitment
on the part of African leaders to move rapidly towards good  governance  and
respect for human rights.

In this respect the AU peer review mechanism will prove  vital  in  exerting
pressure on African leaders to implement and sustain  good  governance.  The
IFP, therefore, welcomes the appointment this week of the  six-member  panel
of eminent  persons  that  will  be  charged  with  quietly  monitoring  and
pressurising African  leaders.  We  also  welcome  the  fact  that  a  South
African, Dr Chris Stals, former Governor of the South African Reserve  Bank,
was included in  the  panel,  as  well  as  Graça  Machel,  wife  of  former
President Nelson  Mandela.  The  other  members  are  from  Nigeria,  Kenya,
Senegal, Cameroon and the United Nations.

We hope that the establishment of this panel of eminent persons will send  a
clear signal to G8 states that Africa is serious about  turning  the  corner
and closing the book on war, conflict and authoritarian dictatorship.

                               STREET JUSTICE

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr M S BOOI (ANC): Madam Speaker, the  ANC  notes  with  grave  concern  the
alleged necklacing of two people at Bram Fischerville in  Johannesburg.  The
two brothers were suspected of being criminals  involved  in  car  hijacking
and armed robbery activities.

While we as the ANC share the view held  by  the  overwhelming  majority  of
South Africans that the demon of  crime  needs  to  be  rooted  out  of  our
society, we, however, believe that in doing so, the law that we as a  people
have instituted must at all times be respected. We, as  communities,  should
not take the law into our own hands. We should, instead, work  closely  with
the bodies to ensure that the  due  process  of  the  law  is  followed  and
criminals are subsequently put behind bars.

This we must do in reconstructing our country and to strengthen  the  beacon
of justice and democracy our Constitution provides for. [Applause.]

                          THE SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr W A ODENDAAL (Nuwe NP): Geagte Speaker, die Nuwe NP  doen  'n  beroep  op
die Reserwe Bank om so gou doenlik 'n rentekoersverlaging aan te bring.  Mnr
Tito  Mboweni  moet  gelukgewens  word  met  die  welkome  afname   in   die
produsenteprysindeks na 3,3% in April, maar dit  is  ontstellend  dat  Suid-
Afrika se ekonomiese groeikoers van 2,4% in die eerste kwartaal, na 1,5%  in
April afgeneem het. Hierdie  afname  in  die  groeikoers  moet  dien  as  'n
waarskuwingssein  aan  die  Regering  dat  sneller  ekonomiese   groei   nie
noodwendig op 'n verlaging in die  inflasiekoers  volg  nie.  Daarom  is  'n
rentekoersverlaging  nou  noodsaaklik  om  die  weg  te  baan  vir  'n  hoër
ekonomiese groeikoers, vir snelle werkskepping en die  beter  bekamping  van
armoede in Suid-Afrika.

Die   Nuwe   NP   sien   uit   na   die   aankondiging   van   die   jongste
verbruikersprysindeks later  vandag,  veral  in  die  lig  daarvan  dat  dit
waarskynlik die afgelope tyd foutief bereken  is.  Suid-Afrika  kan  hierdie
soort foute nie bekostig  nie,  en  die  Minister  van  Finansies  sal  moet
toesien  dat  so-iets  nie  weer  gebeur   nie.   Indien   die   indeks   'n
betekenisvolle verlaging toon, sal dit beteken dat die land en lede van  die
publiek die afgelope paar maande onnodig miljoene rande verloor het, om  nie
eers te praat van die negatiewe effek wat dit  op  beleggervertroue  sal  hê
nie. (Translation of Afrikaans member's statement follows.)

[Dr W A ODENDAAL (New NP): Hon Speaker, the New NP appeals  to  the  Reserve
Bank to effect an interest rate reduction  as  soon  as  possible.  Mr  Tito
Mboweni is to be congratulated on  the  welcome  decrease  in  the  producer
price index to 3,3% in April, but it is disconcerting  that  South  Africa's
economic growth rate decreased from 2,4% in the first  quarter  to  1,5%  in
April. This decrease in the growth rate should serve as  a  warning  to  the
Government that more rapid economic growth does not necessarily follow on  a
reduction in the inflation rate. That is why a  reduction  in  the  interest
rate is now vital to pave the way for a higher economic growth  rate,  rapid
job creation and the more effective combating of poverty in South Africa.

The New NP looks forward to the  announcement  later  today  of  the  latest
consumer price index, especially in the  light  of  the  fact  that  it  has
probably been incorrectly calculated in recent times.  South  Africa  cannot
afford these kinds of mistakes, and the Minister of  Finance  will  have  to
see to it that this does not happen  again.  If  the  index  demonstrates  a
significant reduction, this will mean that the country and  members  of  the
public have unnecessarily  lost  millions  of  rands  during  the  past  few
months, not to mention the negative effect that this will have  on  investor
confidence.]

                  EXPEDITING FINALISATION OF CRIMINAL CASES

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr S N SWART (ACDP): Madam Speaker, the  ACDP  recently  participated  in  a
successful oversight visit by the joint  committee,  comprising  members  of
both the Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio committees  to  various
provinces. One of the  most  prominent  aspects  of  the  visit  related  to
frustrations experienced in  the  finalisation  of  criminal  cases  by  the
criminal courts.

The domino effect of court delays results in the  public  losing  confidence
in our criminal justice system. Additionally,  large  numbers  of  awaiting-
trial prisoners are kept in custody at  great  state  expense,  pending  the
finalisation of their trials. The joint committee spent a large  portion  of
its  time  discussing  ways  of   reducing   delays   in   court.   However,
interdepartmental  discussions  with  the  members  were  most  useful   and
resulted in immediate solutions, such  as  Saturday  courts  at  St  Alban's
Prison, with public defenders acting for inmates.
The various Government departments involved in the  Business  Against  Crime
integrated justice system project at Port Elizabeth courts are  also  to  be
commended on the success of that particular project, as well as the  success
of the pretrial services project.  Both  served  to  finalise  matters  more
quickly, and to reduce the number of awaiting-trial prisoners considerably.

The ACDP is, however, concerned to  hear  that  similar  projects  in  other
provinces have not been continued due to a lack of donor funding.  We  trust
that the positive attitude displayed by  officials  in  the  Port  Elizabeth
region will  be  emulated  in  other  provinces,  and  that  particular  the
integrated justice system and pretrial services projects will be rolled  out
nationwide.

Finally, the ACDP also welcomes the announcement that  Adv  Frank  Kahn  has
been appointed to address unacceptably long delays in the High Court  rolls,
and the possibility that criminal cases are to be heard all year round.

        CALL ON GOVERNMENT TO SPEED UP ISSUING OF IDENTITY DOCUMENTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr P H CHAUKE (ANC): Madam Speaker,  the  Department  of  Home  Affairs  was
recently taken to Durban High Court  by  Rwandese  refugees,  who  had  been
granted refugee status, who were unable to  obtain  their  refugee  identity
documents. The court ruled in favour of  the  refugees  and  instructed  the
department to urgently issue them with the required documents.  Without  the
required  documents  these  refugees  cannot  access  services   which   are
available to people with refugee  status,  like  institutions  of  learning,
international aid, and so on.

Furthermore, being a signatory to various protocols  relating  to  treatment
of refugees, slow delivery on such matters  would  impact  negative  on  our
country's image. We,  therefore,  call  upon  Government  to  speed  up  the
process of issuing identity documents. These contribute to pushing back  the
frontiers of poverty through  improving  the  level  of  access  to  service
delivery. [Applause.]

                          APPEAL FOR NATIONAL UNITY

                            (Member's Statement)

Dr M S MOGOBA (PAC): Madam Speaker,  I  appeal  for  national  unity.  There
remains one piece of unfinished business in  the  liberation  struggle,  the
issue of national  unity.  This  is  surprising  because  we  have  overcome
apartheid and have a much-acclaimed constitutional democracy.  It  has  been
said that apartheid is dead, but  it  is  not  yet  buried  and  its  corpse
stinks.

It is also ironic that we have just celebrated 40 years of existence of  the
Organisation of African  Unity.  The  African  Union  was  launched  in  our
country and our President is the present head of the AU. As  we  travel  the
length and breadth of our  continent  preaching  African  unity,  Nepad  and
African Renaissance, our credibility is greatly undermined when  we  do  not
raise a finger to bring about African and national unity here at home.

It is simplistic and naive to imagine that the PAC, Azapo, IFP,  UDM,  UCDP,
AEB and so on, will evaporate or melt in the African  sun.  The  Afrikaners,
who were united in and by apartheid and were monolithic, are now  fragmented
into the New NP, FF, NA and so on. [Interjections.] There is also  the  ugly
resurgence of white conservatism and the ugly threat of an Afrikaner war  of
liberation or war for the revival of Afrikaner oppression and domination.

We have just  had  the  circus  of  floor-crossing,  the  most  undemocratic
transformation, the gaining of seats without the approval of the  electorate
and the result has been that 17 parties are now in existence. We need to  be
more open about the problem of  African  and  national  unity  in  order  to
arrest  the  cancer  of  political  fragmentation  and  national   disunity,
otherwise our lofty dream of African unity, African  Renaissance  and  Nepad
will turn out to be an expensive mirage.
            CONDEMNATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN SCHOOL SPORT

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N B FIHLA (ANC): Madam Speaker, an Afrikaner  organisation  circulated  a
letter to  schools  announcing  rugby,  hockey  and  netball  trials  for  a
tournament that is open to white Afrikaner pupils only.

The ANC very strongly condemns sporting activities which  perpetuate  racial
division in our  country.  We  strongly  believe  that  organising  sporting
activities along racial lines, serves only to predispose  innocent  children
to the seeds of the evil and barbaric white supremacist ideology.

The ANC believes that the Government and the people  of  South  Africa  have
made strides in building national unity and a stable democratic society.  We
believe that sport and other cultural activities should be used  to  promote
unity and national reconciliation amongst our people.
We call on the people of South Africa to stay  away  from  these  activities
and isolate those elements that seek to sow racial division in  our  beloved
country. [Applause.]

                  CAPE FLORISTIC REGION CONSERVATION GRANTS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr E K MOORCROFT (DA): Madam Speaker, the DA  welcomes  the  news  that  the
Washington-based  Global  Environment  Facility,  has  approved  two  grants
totalling US$14,55 million in support of the first six years  of  a  20-year
programme to promote the globally  important  Cape  floristic  region.  This
programme targets the conservation of all ecosystems in  the  fynbos  region
including rivers, estuaries and marine protected areas.

Other projects to benefit would be the  development  of  the  Tankwa  Karoo-
Cedarberg mega reserve, the Baviaanskloof mega reserve in the  Eastern  Cape
and the Gouritz River-Swartberg mega reserve in the Southern Cape.
This  initiative,  which  involves  more  than  R110  million,  will  be  of
inestimable value in conserving our incomparable environmental heritage  and
will be welcomed by all who understand its importance.

       CONCERNS REGARDING THE ROLE OF THE SANDF IN BURUNDI AND THE DRC

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr T E VEZI (IFP): Madam Speaker, earlier this week the IFP  warned  against
the  consequences  of  deploying  South  African   military   personnel   on
peacekeeping missions on the African continent in  the  absence  of  a  very
clear mission mandate and rules of engagement that would allow our  soldiers
to protect themselves. Our warning could scarcely have been  more  prescient
as, the day before yesterday, it came to  light  that  the  Burundian  rebel
group, Forces for the Defence of Democracy, had warned that it would  attack
and kill  South  African  soldiers  who  form  part  of  the  African  Union
peacekeeping force in Burundi.

The warning bells should have rung a  long  time  ago.  When  South  African
soldiers were first deployed to Burundi,  in  2001,  they  were  sent  as  a
protection force for returning politicians. In  taking  this  limited  role,
our forces would not have been seen as a threat  by  any  of  the  combatant
groups. Our forces were also permanently stationed  around  Bujumbura  which
limited their exposure to danger.

However, it now appears that the focus has shifted from  the  protection  of
leaders to active peacekeeping efforts.  Our  soldiers  plus  an  additional
advance component are tasked with disarming the remaining rebel groups.  Any
military person worth his or her salt would immediately tell one that  there
is clear daylight  between  acting  as  a  bodyguard  and  disarming  active
combatant forces. There can be no comparison in the threat level  these  two
very different missions represent.

The crucial question then is  whether  the  South  African  force  has  been
issued with a clear mandate to conduct a more risky mission in  Burundi  and
whether the rules of engagement have been set at a level where our  soldiers
will be able to protect themselves by acting in self-defence.

Furthermore, this question has serious implications for  the  South  African
battalion deployed in the  DRC  in  the  light  of  the  far  more  volatile
situation in that country. Taken in conjunction with  recent  pronouncements
by Government officials, that more  battalions  of  South  African  soldiers
could be deployed in the DRC, the IFP has to reiterate its  call:  Give  our
soldiers a very clear mandate for their mission and  the  tools  to  protect
themselves.

                            CHILD PROTECTION WEEK

                            (Member's Statement)

Mrs T J TSHIVHASE (ANC): Madam Speaker, seeing this is children's week ...

[... in our African culture - Tshivenda,  for  example  -  a  girl  was  not
allowed to be more educated than a boy. It was said that  she  would  become
mad. Apartheid worsened the matter by not allowing girls to  learn  subjects
such as maths, science and business-related subjects because they were  only
supposed to work in the kitchen and get married. They were only  allowed  to
study subjects that would get them nowhere.

implemented equal educational opportunities for all. This  is  supported  by

                               HIV IN PRISONS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr J DURAND (New NP): Madam Speaker, the New NP  was  alarmed  on  Wednesday
when the Minister of Correctional Services stated in this  House  that  HIV-
positive and HIV-negative prisoners are not being kept  in  separate  cells.
Therefore, we once again renew our  demands  for  an  urgent  and  extensive
investigation into how many people have been infected with HIV in prisons.

The latest figures from the Institute for Security  Studies  which  indicate
that 41% of the South African prison population is HIV-positive confirm  the
disturbing figures released by Inspecting Judge  Fagan  in  May  2002,  that
more than 4 000 of the 10 000 prisoners released monthly  are  HIV-positive.
This situation is a great danger to the HIV-negative  person  in  detention.
Therefore, the New NP, once again, suggests that all prisoners  who  request
to be tested should freely undergo HIV testing and can  insist  on  separate
detention.

A recent court settlement  involving  a  person  who  alleged  that  he  was
infected with HIV in prison confirms the New NP's position that it  is  only
a matter of time before the Department of Correctional  Services  will  have
to defend similar claims which can cost millions of rands. It is indeed  the
right of  any  HIV-negative  person  to  stay  HIV-negative.  The  necessary
protection and provision  must  be  created  in  the  correctional  services
system because the circumstances are outside the control  of  the  detainee.
[Applause.]

             ALLOCATION OF ADDITIONAL CHILD PROTECTION OFFICERS

                            (Member's Statement)

Mr N J CLELLAND-STOKES (DA): Madam Speaker, yesterday  the  Deputy  Minister
for Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  said  that  additional  child
protection officers had been allocated and  would  be  placed  in  seriously
understaffed police units as soon as they were trained. This still leaves  a
shortage of 248 child protection officers in a country  where  children  are
the most vulnerable victims. It is not enough that we  merely  do  a  little
more to protect our children. The DA believes that  we  must  do  everything
possible to protect our children.

Only when there are no longer any children who are being raped,  beaten  and
abused can we say that we are doing enough. Given  that  the  Government  is
not prepared to do everything necessary to eradicate child  rape  and  abuse
in South Africa, we are forced to accept that the  ANC  believes  that  some
level of child abuse is inevitable. Perhaps the Deputy Minister for  Justice
and Constitutional Development will inform us as to  when  all  these  vital
positions will be filled.

                    ARMED FORCES IN PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF DEFENCE: Madam Speaker, I would like to say to the  members,
in response to the statement regarding the  armed  forces  in  peacekeeping,
that it is important that  they  should  always  feel  free  to  access  the
mission mandate documents which indicate  the  conditions  under  which  our
members of the National Defence Force are deployed. It will  be  seen  that,
in the SA Protection Support Detachment mandate to Burundi, it  is  provided
that members of the SA National Defence Force are allowed to arm  themselves
to the extent that they are able to defend themselves in the circumstances.

Similarly, now that the SA Protection Support Detachment  mandate  that  was
protecting the leaders has been expanded to be the mandate  of  the  African
mission in Burundi, that mandate increases their  capacity  to  be  able  to
defend themselves. Therefore, they carry  equipment  commensurate  with  the
capacity that the combatants are likely to use against themselves. There  is
no way in which we could deploy members of the  SA  National  Defence  Force
without enabling them to defend themselves.

However, for the record, I should also like to say to the  members  that  we
have now completed 18 months of deployment in Burundi, which was  the  first
phase of the transitional government. To date, there has not been  a  single
attack by any of the armed combatants  on  the  SA  National  Defence  Force
deployees there. And, at the time, there were four armed groups  which  were
fighting the Government. At the present time, three of them have signed  the
ceasefire. The remaining one - FNL Rwasa - is on its way to the  talks  with
its commanders. We expect that, at this time, the probability of  them  also
signing that ceasefire is very high.

The situation in Burundi, rather than worsening, has in fact been  improving
immensely. I would like to assure the House, therefore,  that  there  is  no
way in which we will expose, and nor have we unduly exposed members  of  the
National Defence Force, to danger. A similar situation prevails in  the  DRC
and elsewhere, for instance in Ethiopia and Eritrea where we  have  deployed
our people. I do not think that there is cause for  alarm.  Members  of  the
House are free to approach my office or  the  department  for  the  mandates
which will give them accurate information  regarding  the  conditions  under
which the forces are deployed. [Applause.]

                       HIV/AIDS PREVALENCE IN PRISONS

                            (Minister's Response)

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker, I will try to  respond
to three statements. I am not sure how much time I have for that.

The SPEAKER: After this, I think you  will  have  a  lot  of  time  in  your
debate. [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker,  the  first  statement
from the hon member from the DA to  me  is  very  difficult  to  respond  to
because its a prophecy of doom, which condemns the entire  criminal  justice
system and the whole Government. But I must say that last  week  I  did  say
that there would be deliberations on the criminal justice cluster this  week
and next week. Members will be  free  to  engage  those  issues  with  those
departments.

In response to the hon member from the ACDP, I think that the  statement  is
quite encouraging because he precisely pointed out  those  areas  which  the
criminal justice system needs to emphasise. I think we all  heard  that  and
we will try to look at that statement more positively.
With regard to HIV/Aids and non-segregation of sufferers,  I  have  made  it
abundantly clear that this is  not  only  Government  policy,  but  also  an
international law derived from the World Health Organisation.  I  have  also
made it very clear that I am not averse to amending and  changing  policies,
but we do have the legislative process in this country. There are  portfolio
committees, Parliament and Cabinet. If the shocked member wants  to  unshock
himself, those are the processes that he can follow.

                       CHILDREN UNDER THREAT OF ABUSE

                            (Minister's Response)

The DEPUTY  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam
Speaker, in response to some of the observations made by members, I  pointed
out yesterday that the information brought to us by the  DP  -  through  the
hon Waters - was not information which we did not already have. His  efforts
in that area of work are laudable, but we have invited him in  the  past  to
become part of the solution and not to keep restating a problem of which  we
are aware.

The whole process in response to children under the threat of  abuse  is  an
integrated one. We have increased our Sexual Offences  Courts  to  39  -  an
unprecedented increase. The Child Protection Units  are  being  rearmed  and
reinforced in our efforts to increase them in a sustainable manner.  We  are
also responding through social development. It is an integrated response.

We invite the hon Waters, once again, to join  our  integrated  response  to
solve the problems  and  stop  his  gratuitous  carpings.  His  response  is
absolute  rubbish.  Our  response  has  been  entirely  integrated.  We  are
spending more money on our response against the abuse of women and  children
than ever before. We have, in fact, ringfenced money in the  Justice  budget
for the protection of women's and children's rights. We will continue to  do
this. We use the information that we get from all parties and role-players.

I have to make it quite clear that this is, as I said  yesterday,  simply  a
cursory inventory of our response to the issue of  violence  and  abuse.  It
has been extraordinary. We named them yesterday. If the  hon  member  thinks
that he can carry on standing up and pretending that this does  not  make  a
difference, he is wrong. [Applause.]

          CONSIDERATION OF COMPLAINT AGAINST MINISTER M G P LEKOTA

     (Consideration of Report of Joint Committee on Ethics and Members'
                                 Interests)

Mr L T LANDERS: Madam Speaker, in presenting this  report  to  you  I  wish,
firstly, to  express  my  appreciation  for  the  diligence  and  commitment
displayed by hon members of the joint committee in addressing  matters  such
as the one before this House today.

The report before this House speaks for itself and  contains  enough  detail
for hon members. I therefore beg your indulgence and that of the House as  I
wish to address one or two points emanating from this  case.  Regardless  of
one's views about this case, the  most  significant  aspect  of  the  report
before us is that our system of ethics works. Our  system  has  proved  that
even our most senior members of Parliament and the most powerful amongst  us
are bound by the provisions of our code and can be held accountable.

The second important point I wish to place before  you  is  that  the  Joint
Committee on Ethics and Members' Interests is constrained by the  provisions
of the code and the Joint Rules of Parliament,  which  include  the  penalty
provisions and the rules of procedure for conducting investigations. We  can
only do what is in the Joint Rules and what is is  the  code.  We  can  only
impose the sanctions that are provided for in the Joint Rules.

Given some of the adverse comments and criticisms following the  committee's
findings, it is important to note that the Joint  Committee  on  Ethics  and
Members' Interests is not a court of law. It is also important to note  that
the Office of the Registrar of Members' Interests is not a  police  station,
and  neither  is  the  joint  committee  Parliament's  equivalent   of   the
Scorpions.

I want to reiterate what we said in our statement to the  media  on  22  May
2003. After careful consideration of  all  the  facts  and  evidence  placed
before us, the members  of  the  committee  unanimously  and,  let  me  add,
enthusiastically agreed to the findings  and  sanctions  contained  in  this
report.

On behalf of  the  Joint  Committee  on  Ethics  and  Members'  Interests  I
therefore ask this honourable House to accept this report, its findings  and
recommended sanctions,  and  I  ask  that  these  sanctions  be  implemented
promptly. [Applause.]

The SPEAKER: By agreement I will now recognise parties to make  declarations
of vote.

Declarations of vote:

Mr M J ELLIS: Madam Speaker,  the  purpose  of  the  parliamentary  code  of
ethics, and all other codes applying to politicians, is  to  help  ensure  a
clean and corruption-free government in our country.

Virtually every newspaper of significance in  South  Africa  has  criticised
the sentence passed on Minister  Lekota.  Numerous  cartoons  and  acres  of
editorial space depicted the findings of the  ethics  committee  as  a  mere
slap on the wrist. The implication of all this is that the media, at  least,
believe the Minister's conduct  was  more  serious  than  the  parliamentary
committee has found.

What needs to be understood is that the  ethics  committee  has  to  confine
itself to the breaches of the code of  conduct  applying  to  MPs.  However,
there are other  avenues  that  can  and  must  be  followed  regarding  the
Minister's conduct in his capacity as  a  Minister.  My  party  has  already
referred the ministerial aspects to the Public Protector for investigation.

I believe that the public find it very worrying  when  the  people  who  are
sent to Parliament to make the rules begin to believe that  they  are  above
them. This is one such case. It is our view that Minister  Lekota  can  stay
on as an MP having been chastised and  fined,  but  that  he  should  either
resign or be fired as a Minister. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Madam Speaker, the New  NP  welcomes  the  fact  that  Minister
Lekota, in complete honesty, admitted that he had  omitted  to  declare  his
business interests to Parliament. He, however, co-operated  fully  with  the
ethics committee,  acknowledging  its  authority.  He  has  apologised.  The
member acted honourably by apologising publicly. However, it  is  a  serious
matter and must be dealt with in that light.

The ANC is also to be congratulated on not trying to engage  in  a  cover-up
and the fact that the ethics committee was unanimous in  its  decision.  The
New NP supports the committee's decision.

In conclusion, many of us are new to Parliament and to business.  Parliament
should consider holding a workshop at which all the aspects  of  ethics  and
members' interests are discussed  so  that  all  members  will  realise  the
gravity of the situation. [Applause.]

Mr L M GREEN: Madam Speaker, hon Ministers and members, the ACDP feels  that
the confession made by the Minister in the ethics committee  is  commendable
- that he confessed that what he did was wrong. That is always a start -  if
something one did was wrong to admit that it was wrong.  However,  we  feel,
as far as the verdict and the confession that was made in the committee  are
concerned, that maybe it would have been more appropriate for  the  Minister
to make the confession in the House and to make it publicly.

Secondly, as far as the role of the Speaker is concerned,  we  feel  that  a
precedent has been set in which if a member of  Parliament  has  erred,  the
Speaker, in her position as Speaker, has the authority to reprimand  such  a
member publicly. We feel that in this instance  it  is  also  important  for
Madam Speaker to have the authority and the right to be able to do that.
As far  as  the  recommendation  is  concerned,  we  would  agree  with  the
interpretation of the DA in that we also feel that  it  is  a  slap  on  the
wrist - maybe the penalty should have been harsher. However, we  also  admit
and accept that the Minister had the courage to make  a  public  apology  in
the committee.

We feel that the role of the Speaker, however,  has  been  omitted,  and  we
think that it would have been appropriate for the Speaker to  say  something
on this. [Interjections.]

Mrs L R MBUYAZI: Madam Speaker, hon  Ministers  and  hon  members,  the  IFP
notes the report.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Agb Speaker, ek wil graag die lede van  hierdie  Huis  daaraan
herinner dat ons luister na die verslag van  die  Etiekkomitee  en  nie  die
Gestapo nie. In die boek Ester in die Bybel lees ons van Hamman wat 'n  galg
gebou het waaraan Mordegai moes hang. Op die ou end was dit Hamman self  wat
aan daardie galg gehang het.

Ons moet oppas dat ons nie op hierdie manier optree nie. Ons moet waak  teen
'n heksejag en nie die kwessie van etiek en ledebelange wat hierdie Huis  en
sy gehalte moet uitbou, misbruik om soos  honde  op  mekaar  te  gluur  nie.
Enige persoon met die mees basiese kennis van die reg sal vir  jou  sê  daar
is 'n wesenlike verskil tussen oortredings  met  opset  en  oortredings  uit
nalatigheid.

Ek wil dit duidelik sê: as daar  die  geringste  bewys  is  van  onregmatige
bevoordeling, sou die Nasionale Aksie ook vir baie  ernstige  optrede  gevra
het. Maar ons moet ook weet - ons is almal menslik, ons moet ook so  teenoor
mekaar optree. Die reëls van die Parlement maak voorsiening vir 'n  bepaalde
prosedure, 'n prosedure wat deur hierdie Huis voorgeskryf is en waaroor  ons
almal ooreengekom het. Die Nasionale Aksie  wil  waarsku  teen  mediaverhore
deur parlementslede oor sake wanneer ons oor 'n prosedure ooreengekom het.

Die prosedure is  gevolg,  die  komitee  het  sy  uitspraak  gegee,  en  die
Nasionale Aksie steun dit van harte. [Applous.]  (Translation  of  Afrikaans
declaration of vote follows.)

[Mr C AUCUMP: Hon Speaker, I would like to remind the members of this  House
that we are listening to the report of the  Ethics  Committee  and  not  the
Gestapo. In the book of Esther in the Bible we read about Haman who built  a
gallows on which Mordecai was to be hanged. In the end it was Haman  himself
who was hanged on those gallows.

We must guard against acting in this manner. We must guard against a  witch-
hunt and not misuse the issue of ethics and members'  interests,  which  are
intended to develop this House and its quality,  to  glare  at  one  another
like dogs. Any person with the most basic knowledge of  the  law  will  tell
you that there is a fundamental  difference  between  premeditated  offences
and offences committed as a result of negligence.

I want to state this clearly: If there  had  been  the  slightest  proof  of
wrongful favouring, the National Action  would  also  have  asked  for  very
serious action. But we must also know - we  are  all  human,  we  must  also
treat one another as such. The rules of  Parliament  make  provision  for  a
specific procedure, a procedure which was laid down by  this  House  and  to
which we all agreed.  The  National  Action  wants  to  warn  against  media
hearings by members of Parliament about matters when we  have  agreed  on  a
procedure.

The procedure was  followed,  the  committee  gave  its  judgment,  and  the
National Action supports it whole-heartedly. [Applause.]]

The SPEAKER: The PAC is up next. No, sorry, Mrs de Lille. My apologies.  Old
habits die hard.

Mrs P DE LILLE: Madam Speaker, the code of ethics has been abused  so  often
that I think it is time we re-examined the code of  ethics.  I  have  always
held the view that we need an Act of Parliament that would make  any  of  us
violating the code a crime. We need a code that has teeth and  a  code  that
could be a deterrent. Where a  member  has  benefited,  the  money  must  be
recovered.
The  Constitution  is  now  more  democratic  than  the  drafters   of   the
Constitution. The Constitution is also more  democratic  than  most  of  our
people in this country. We need to protect the Constitution.

Cabinet should not become a revolving door  through  which  Ministers  enter
and thereafter leave to go into business and get rich. We also call  on  the
President now to invoke and implement the  Executive  Members'  Ethics  Act,
failing which he would also be in contempt of an Act of Parliament. I  thank
you. [Interjections.]

Ms  T  E  MILLIN:  Madam  Speaker,  notwithstanding  hon  Minister  Lekota's
commendable admission before the ethics committee, the  Independent  African
Movement, the IAM, fully endorses the sentiments expressed by the hon  Ellis
on behalf of the official opposition. [Interjections.]

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE MAJORITY PARTY: Madam Speaker, ladies  and  gentlemen,
since the advent of democracy in 1994 the ANC  has  sponsored  a  number  of
initiatives in this country  aimed  at  encouraging  clean  and  transparent
governance.

The code of ethics, for instance, was initiated by the ANC as  part  of  the
broader effort to develop a new culture of transparency  and  accountability
in public life. As we introduced these measures while cognisant of the  need
to tackle, in a cohesive manner, the kind of  corruption  that  was  endemic
under apartheid, there have been those among  us  who  have  always  opposed
them. They,  to  this  day,  are  consistently  opposed  to  a  law-governed
society. They make extremely loud noises, trying to persuade the  people  of
this country to disregard due process and  act  outside  our  constitutional
and legal provisions.

However, we have remained confident of the  proven  ability  of  structures,
such as the joint ethics  committee,  to  do  their  work  without  fear  or
favour. In this regard,  we  congratulate  the  joint  ethics  committee  on
sterling work done.

We remain,  also,  fully  cognisant  of  the  reality  that  these  measures
constitute new and relatively uncharted waters in the life  of  this  nation
and in the international context. For these measures  to  work,  our  nation
needs to broaden its understanding of due process. It needs to continue,  as
it has in the past, to strengthen its political will to implement  both  the
letter and the spirit of such.

Despite their relative newness, the ANC is,  of  course,  happy  that  these
mechanisms are working, are supported by  all  well-meaning  South  Africans
and that our democracy is being strengthened and consolidated on an  ongoing
basis.

We move for the adoption of this report. [Applause.]

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

The SPEAKER: Hon members,  the  sanctions,  as  approved,  will  be  applied
immediately. I want to draw attention to the fact that  the  Speaker  cannot
go beyond the decision of the House. The sanctions, which  were  recommended
unanimously by the committee, are a written reprimand from  the  Speaker  of
the National Assembly and a fine equivalent to one  week's  salary  -  seven
days' salary. These are the sanctions that will be implemented promptly.

              FILLING OF VACANCIES ON NATIONAL YOUTH COMMISSION

  (Consideration of Report of Joint Monitoring Committee on Improvement of
     Quality of Life and Status of Children, Youth and Disabled Persons)

There was no debate.

Report adopted (Democratic Alliance abstaining).

                             APPROPRIATION BILL

                Debate on Vote No 21 - Correctional Services:

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL SERVICES: Madam Speaker,  hon  members  of  the
House, members and  officials  of  Correctional  Services  who  are  in  the
gallery, ladies and gentlemen, and visitors who have come to hear  our  Vote
this morning, I  must  say  that  various  societies  the  world  over  hold
divergent views  about  the  purpose  of  a  correctional  system.  This  is
necessarily  so  because  of  their  different   historical   and   cultural
experiences. Prisons in  many  ways  have  become  the  dumping  ground  for
society's unwanted members and for those that we believe to be untamed.

Research shows that a significant number of  prisoners  enter  prisons  with
mental health and other medical problems. A  high  proportion  of  prisoners
lack even basic literacy skills. Owing to  a  lack  of  resources,  many  of
these problems are not adequately tackled within the prison environment.

In an attempt to find answers to questions on the concept and philosophy  of
corrections, authors such as Richard Terrill found that  the  importance  of
the  juxtaposition  of  penal  theory  and  the  architectural   design   of
correctional institutions is a notion that emerged  in  England  during  the
late 18th century. At roughly the same time, police practitioners  began  in
earnest to support improvements in law enforcement. People were  questioning
some of the basic assumptions behind the administration of justice, just  as
they  were  questioning  many  of  the  established  political,   religious,
scientific and social assumptions on which society was based.

Many of these basic tenets were  introduced  originally  during  the  Middle
Ages, a period that some have referred to as the  Age  of  Faith.  The  18th
century was a markedly different period,  known  by  contemporaries  as  the
Enlightenment - the Age of Reason - espousing a belief that  the  individual
was a free,  rational  and  equal  member  of  society.  Such  notions  were
obviously at cross-purposes with established custom and authority.

The 18th century serves as a useful  benchmark  for  the  emergence  of  the
modern development of English corrections. It  was  during  this  time  that
people consciously and rationally attempted to study the purpose of and  the
conditions for incarcerating law  violators.  In  order  to  appreciate  the
contributions of Enlightenment thinkers, it is useful to examine  the  state
of corrections at earlier points in time.  Anglo-Saxon  dooms  and  medieval
statutes enable us to piece together this history.

Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, the use of  imprisonment  appears  to
have declined somewhat. Two possible  explanations  have  been  offered  for
this  development.  On  the  one  hand,  imprisoning  people  was  a  costly
enterprise for the captor. On the other hand, alternatives to  incarceration
did exist. For  example,  death,  mutilation  and  outlawry  had  long  been
established methods of punishing serious offenders, while  compensation  was
considered an appropriate sanction for less  serious  offences.  However,  a
trend has developed over the years, which we  also  subscribe  to  as  South
Africa, that a need exists to place more emphasis on the  rehabilitation  of
those who are serving sentences imposed by the courts and  referred  to  our
facilities.

Our transition to a  constitutional  democracy,  which  has  been  aimed  at
making a break with the arduous years marked  by  oppression,  violation  of
the basic rights of citizens, policies of racial discrimination and  general
misrule directed at the African people, demanded that we engaged in  radical
reform programmes of our  prison  system.  Since  the  promulgation  of  the
Correctional Services Act, Act 111  of  1998,  efforts  have  been  made  to
ensure  that  the  correctional  system  operates  in  the  spirit  of   our
Constitution and international conventions and treaties.

The Act attempts to address, among other things,  the  entrenchment  of  the
fundamental rights of offenders, placing special emphasis on the  rights  of
special groups of offenders, such as women, young offenders and children  in
prison;  developing  a  transparent  disciplinary  system   for   offenders;
establishing various safeguards regarding the use of segregation and  force;
creating  a  framework  for  the  treatment,  development  and  support   of
offenders; establishing a correctional supervision and  parole  system  that
involves the community, partners in the  criminal  justice  system  and  the
victim or representative of the victim; and the establishment  of  extensive
external monitoring mechanisms such as the Judicial Inspectorate of  Prisons
and the National Council for Correctional Services.

We remain committed to our vision of being among the first in the  world  to
deliver Correctional Services with integrity and commitment. This  we  shall
attain by placing rehabilitation at the centre of  our  activities  in  safe
and secure environments, and by  strengthening  our  partnerships  with  the
people of South Africa and our global partners, particularly the  people  of
our continent, Africa, in the true spirit of the African  Renaissance  under
the programme of Nepad, or the New Partnership for Africa's Development.

To intensify our involvement in the region, Cabinet approved  a  meeting  of
Ministers responsible for Correctional Services and prisons in the  Southern
African Development Community, SADC, which I requested.  This  meeting  will
take place in Pretoria on 3 July this year.

In our attempt to contribute to international developments in the  field  of
corrections and management of prisons, the commissioner,  with  some  senior
managers and myself, undertook  some  visits  overseas  and  in  Africa.  We
attended conferences and presented  papers  at  some  of  these  forums.  In
recognition of our contribution to  these  global  initiatives,  I,  as  the
Minister  of  Correctional  Services  of  South  Africa,  was  elected  vice
president  of  the  International  Relations  Committee  of   the   American
Correctional Association, the ACA. [Applause.] This,  I  must  say,  is  the
biggest organisation in the field of  corrections  in  the  world  at  which
service  providers,  intellectuals  and  practitioners  in  corrections  and
prisons meet to  share  best  practices  and  developments  in  correctional
services and prison reform.

South Africa's approach to  prison  management  and  community  correctional
supervision  is  based  on  the  principles  of  restorative  justice,  unit
management, direct supervision,  and  secure  and  safe  humane  custody  of
offenders. This approach  is,  as  far  as  is  practicable,  in  line  with
international standards. As Government we believe that correction,  both  as
self-correction and correction of others, is inherent in good citizenship.

All citizens  should  contribute  to  maintaining  and  protecting  a  just,
peaceful and safe society in our country by upholding the law  and  justice,
and by promoting the social responsibility  and  human  development  of  all
citizens.  Correction  is  thus  not  merely  the  responsibility   of   the
Department of Correctional Services, but  a  shared  responsibility  of  all
social institutions and individuals.  The  family,  educational,  religious,
sporting and cultural  institutions,  as  well  as  a  range  of  Government
departments. In cases where these institutions and society have failed,  the
criminal justice system and the Department of Correctional Services take  up
a bigger role in the performance of their responsibilities.

I am talking about families because when I was asked about  the  segregation
of Aids sufferers, somebody wrote me a  note  and  said  I  should  ask  the
member whether, if one has an Aids sufferer in  one's  house,  one  provides
separate rooms and separate facilities, kitchens and so on.  It  just  shows
how people think.

At this tertiary level of correction, rehabilitation and the  prevention  of
recidivism are best achieved through a  person  correcting  their  offending
behaviour, and developing themselves, and not through punishment.  While  it
is  true  that  the  responsibility  is  primarily  that  of  the  offender,
correctional  agencies,  the  community  and  the  household  to  which  the
offender returns also have a great deal of influence on whether or not  that
change will occur.

We view this approach  as  a  medium  to  long-term  plan  and  a  visionary
strategy in turning the tide against crime  in  the  country.  The  role  of
these institutions and individuals can therefore not be  overemphasised.  In
the  context  of  dysfunctional  families,  combined  with  the  discrepancy
between the social values that are enshrined in  the  Constitution  and  the
society that we have inherited, the other social institutions take  on  more
significant importance in the development of a  correcting  environment  for
children and young people.

It is, therefore, a disturbing factor and a cause for concern  that  we  are
experiencing a high  influx  of  young  people  in  our  system.  Statistics
indicate that we have 29 951 young people in our system, of whom 14 573  are
awaiting trial while 15 378 have been sentenced. This is apart from the  208
children or infants who live with their mothers  in  prison.  Today  we  are
still in the process of  observing  Child  Protection  week  throughout  the
country. Every child is entitled to  protection,  and  we  as  a  department
believe that no child belongs in prison.

However, if they are in the circumstances in  which  they  find  themselves,
all of us have the responsibility to ensure that they  too  are  reserved  a
place in the sun. Despite the challenges that we face as  a  department,  we
can proudly report on the advances made in the reforms that the system  went
through and the gains made through the assistance and support of members  of
this House and social partners in society within the  limited  resources  at
our disposal.

We are happy and proud  to  note  that  our  efforts  at  achieving  greater
heights  have  not  gone  unnoticed  since  our  department   was   recently
recognised and nominated as one of the top performers in the public  sector,
by the well-known Impumelelo  group  of  companies.  This  is  a  source  of
tremendous encouragement to us.

In pushing back the frontiers of poverty, Correctional Services  engaged  in
a number of poverty alleviation projects to the value of about R496  239  in
the past financial year. However, the biggest value that we achieved was  to
engage offenders in projects that had a direct  benefit  to  the  community,
through agricultural and building projects. We also wish to thank  community
leaders, that is, makgosi, amakhosi, marena, who supported  our  efforts  in
the various  communities.  We  believe  that  the  sustainability  of  these
projects  depends  on  the  continued  collaboration  between   communities,
community-based institutions and ourselves.

In  the  past  financial  year,  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services
endeavoured to develop a  common  understanding  of  rehabilitation  in  the
context of corrections, and to develop the process through which it  can  be
achieved. It is expected that these initiatives  will  be  delivered  within
these MTEF budget allocations, starting from  the  2003-04  financial  year.
Over the medium term the growth of the programme has slowed down,  owing  to
the pressure on the Vote by a rising prisoner population.

Most of the pressure  is  due  to  administrative  expenditure,  which  will
nearly double from R14,6 million in 2002-03 to  R27,9  million  in  2003-04,
and it is expected to increase further to  R31,5  million  in  2005-06.  The
budget allocation to our department for the 2003-04 financial  year  amounts
to R7,6 billion, and provides for  an  establishment  of  36  320  personnel
posts and operational costs for a daily average offender population  of  183
000 prisoners and 70 000 probationers and parolees. This represents a  total
increase of 9,25% on the total adjusted allocation of R7,2 billion  for  the
2002-03 financial year.

The department estimates that  it  will  receive  income  and  miscellaneous
receipts of about R80,2 million during 2003-04 and that these revenues  will
grow at an annual  average  of  4,5%,  generated  largely  by  the  sale  of
products from prison workshops, hiring out prison  labour  and  renting  out
official personnel accommodation. All income  generated  is  deposited  into
the National Revenue Fund. Of this amount 22,9%  is  generated  through  the
sale of goods and services provided by offenders.

The budget for rehabilitation has increased by an average of 8,3% per  annum
from R264,8 million in 1999-2000 to R427,5 million in 2005-06.  A  total  of
about 22 360 offenders were trained during  2002  in  a  variety  of  skills
related to the workshop, building and agricultural fields.
The establishment of 12 of the planned 14 training centres has already  been
completed. These centres are aimed at the promotion of  occupational  skills
training, in  which  artisan  status  cannot  be  obtained  but  specialised
training is provided. This training is aimed  at  equipping  offenders  with
the basic technical skills in a variety of  fields  such  as  brick  making,
bricklaying,  woodwork,  welding,  garment  making,  etc.  Business   skills
training is also provided in order  to  equip  individuals  with  skills  to
operate their own small businesses. I would like, at this point in time,  to
thank the Department of Labour for their assistance  and  financial  support
in this regard.

The President's Award  Programme,  a  self-development  programme  which  is
available to young offenders and equips them with  life  skills  to  make  a
difference to themselves, their communities and their world, forms  part  of
rehabilitation programmes for young offenders in the  department.  It  is  a
holistic programme that  aims  to  promote  the  social,  psychological  and
physical wellbeing of young people in South Africa.
A Gold President's Awards ceremony was  hosted  in  Grahamstown  on  7  July
2002. During  this  prestigious  event,  the  former  President,  Dr  Nelson
Mandela, who is the patron-in-chief, accompanied the Earl of Wessex and  his
wife and Commissioner Linda Mti.  They  handed  Gold  Awards  to  110  young
offenders who successfully participated in the programme.

The involvement of the President's Awards in young offender  programmes  has
played a significant role in seeing young people in conflict  with  the  law
being successfully reintegrated into society. This programme was founded  by
the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince  Phillip,  in  England,  but  grew  to  be  an
international programme running in a number of countries around  the  world.
In South Africa, it started at St Albans prison in Port Elizabeth, in  1994,
with 14 offenders. To date some 20 000 young  offenders  have  been  through
the programme.

Let me take this opportunity, Madam Speaker, to thank the  Speaker  of  this
House, that is yourself Madam, the hon Dr Frene Ginwala,  on  the  role  she
played as the Chairperson of  the  Board  of  Trustees  of  the  President's
Award. In the same breath  I  wish  to  welcome  and  congratulate  the  hon
Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, as  the  incoming  chairperson.  I  must
also add that  we  remain  indebted  to  our  former  President,  Dr  Nelson
Mandela, for the excellent support and leadership he has  provided  to  date
to the programme as the patron-in-chief.

The Department has made enormous gains in developing a better  understanding
of its role in the implementation of restorative  justice.  This  led  to  a
joint  conference  on  restorative   justice,   titled   "From   theory   to
implementation". It was led by the Department of Justice and  Constitutional
Development,  and  there  were  various  activities  which  included   joint
training sessions conducted by officials from Canada  who  are  regarded  as
leaders in the implementation of this approach.

Our poverty alleviation programmes and the inclusion  of  victims  or  their
representatives  in  our  parole  system  are  at  the  forefront   of   our
initiatives which seek  to  promote  and  operationalise  this  concept  and
facilitate the process of healing and restitution.  The  Moral  Regeneration
Movement and the work of the social cluster of Government  in  strengthening
social  cohesion  and  promoting  social  justice,   will   make   a   major
contribution to the  Department's  rehabilitation  and  correction  efforts,
both  through  teaching  ethical  values  to  those  already  convicted  and
ensuring the revival of the South African ethos and  ethic  of  ubuntu/botho
in our communities.

The R3,5  billion  allocated  for  incarceration  provides  for  the  humane
detention of prisoners in safe custody until  they  are  lawfully  released.
The programme also covers the health care and physical  needs  of  prisoners
in order to comply with  national  and  international  norms  and  standards
regarding the treatment of offenders. These account for  43%  of  the  total
budget over the MTEF period. It is also projected that the expenditure  will
increase due to the envisaged increases in operating  costs,  including  the
appointment of additional personnel caused by  projected  increases  in  the
prisoner population.
Health and physical care expenditure is also expected to increase due to  an
increased provision for prisoner primary health and dental care  to  counter
the spread of opportunistic infections in prisons, including  HIV/Aids.  We,
however, welcome the initiatives from our  partners,  that  is  the  Medical
Research Council, and Emory  University  of  the  USA.  These  organisations
recently  completed  a  survey  on  health  issues   in   prisons   in   the
postapartheid era. Their report is awaited.

Government is equally anxious to get the  planned  HIV/Aids  prevalence  and
attitude survey to be undertaken by the  department  off  the  ground.  This
information will be valuable in aiding decision-making and facilitating  the
implementation of our  HIV/Aids  strategy  amongst  our  own  personnel  and
offenders. It is also envisaged that this will be completed in 12 months.

As a result of the successful implementation of unit  management,  which  is
an effective strategy to reduce prison violence and control  gang  activity,
we have succeeded in managing incidents of violence and unnatural deaths  in
prison. Over and above the safety  of  offenders,  the  department  is  also
committed to reinforce delivery on secure facilities and the  prevention  of
escapes. This is an  integral  part  of  the  purpose  of  the  correctional
system, but it is also a prerequisite for the rehabilitation process.

In general, the department is quite successful in bringing down the  numbers
of escapes, compared to previous years.  However,  due  to  one  unfortunate
incident at Bizana prison, in the Eastern Cape, in December 2002,  where  98
offenders escaped during an evacuation operation as a result  of  a  serious
fire threat, there was an increase in the number  of  escapes  from  223  to
about 281. Spending on community corrections will grow on  average  by  only
3,9% from R258,8 million in 2002-03 to  about  R290,5  million  in  2005-06.
This has the potential to relieve some of the pressure on incarceration  and
overcrowding, as well as reducing the cost of the Vote.

Correctional Services is encouraging alternative sentencing  options  within
the justice, crime prevention and security cluster, and the  enhancement  of
service delivery to parolees  and  probationers  which  will  have  a  major
impact  on  expenditure  in  the  future.  The  challenge  that  faces   the
department  in  relation  to  community  corrections  is  to   enhance   the
rehabilitation,  correction  and   development   aspects   of   correctional
supervision in order for it to be seen as a  viable  alternative  sentencing
option.

The Department's approach  to  the  extension  of  correction  of  offending
behaviour, promotion of social responsibility and  development  of  a  human
being in community-based supervision has been to ensure  that  there  is  an
integrated support system. This is complemented by a system of referral  and
networking that  supports  the  offenders  in  their  residential  area  and
facilitates their reintegration into the  community  from  which  they  have
come.

The problem of overcrowding in  our  prisons  remains  one  of  the  biggest
challenges facing the department. Overcrowding has a negative effect on  our
operations as it  impacts  on  staff  morale  due  to  unacceptable  working
conditions, the health of offenders, effective safe custody and  ability  of
the department to  allocate  resources  effectively  for  rehabilitation  of
offenders and  results  in  abnormally  high  maintenance  costs  of  prison
facilities.  The  latest  available  figures  indicate   that   our   prison
population stands at about 187 748. Our capacity  remains  at  110  874  and
this means that we are overpopulated by 78 874 or 71,1%.

South Africa, I must say, was  last  year  classified  as  the  fourth  most
aggressive jailer in the world after the US, Russia  and  Belarus.  However,
we are encouraged by the allocation of R900,6 million for our capital  works
projects. This figure provides for the construction of four  new  facilities
with a capacity of 3 000 each within this MTEF period.  These  projects  are
expected to begin later this year and it is  envisaged  that  they  will  be
operational by the 2005-06 financial year. This will be the first  batch  of
prisons that would be in accordance the new generation  low-cost  affordable
prison designs which I unveiled in August 2002.

Repairs and renovations are continuing in 12 prisons in  KwaZulu-Natal,  the
Eastern  Cape  and  the  North  West  province  and  accommodation  will  be
available for about 863 more offenders. The department continues to  address
the maintenance of its fixed assets and the improvement of  the  quality  of
the prison facilities. Contracts  have  been  awarded  for  the  repair  and
maintenance of  33  prisons,  of  which  14  have  been  completed  and  the
remainder will be completed during the current  financial  year.  A  further
146 prisons have been identified for the awarding of  contracts  for  repair
and maintenance, that is the Ramp programme.

It is therefore imperative that we involve prisoners in undertaking most  of
the repairs as part of the training programme. Because  most  officials  are
here I want to re-emphasise that it is imperative that we involve  prisoners
in undertaking most of the repairs as  part  of  their  training  programme.
Forget about people from outside.

The budget allocation provides for an amount of  R492,9  million,  which  is
6,4% of the total budget, for financing of the operational costs of the  two
privately-operated prisons which have a capacity  of  5  952  beds  and  are
managed under the Asset Procurement and Operating Partnership Systems  as  a
public-private enterprise. We continue to receive positive  and  encouraging
reports from the two facilities which are Mangaung Prison in the Free  State
and Kutama Sinthumule Prison in Limpopo province.

Flowing from the process of gearing the department  for  rehabilitation,  as
well as the restructuring and transformation  of  the  Public  Service,  the
department agreed on a new range of services to be provided to offenders  in
carrying out our mandate. These services will form the basis of  our  budget
as soon as National Treasury approval has been obtained  to  recognise  them
as programmes. However, the strategic  plan  tabled  in  Parliament  already
provides for  these  programmes,  namely,  corrections,  development,  care,
security, facilities and aftercare.

To promote the effective governance and administration  of  the  department,
the budget allocation provides for a personnel expenditure which amounts  to
R4,9  billion  for  salaries.  Over  the  medium  term,  this  category   of
expenditure will continue to dominate due to the labour-intensive nature  of
our operations. Our people, correctional officials  and  management,  are  a
valuable resource in the delivery of our services. Correctional Services  is
a people  business.  We  therefore  need  people  in  order  for  us  to  be
effective.

The department has asserted that every member is a  rehabilitator,  and  has
shown that the manner in which each and every staff member performs  his  or
her task either  contributes  to  creating  an  environment  which  promotes
rehabilitation  or  militates  against  rehabilitation  and  correction   of
offending behaviour. The ideal correctional official should be a person  who
finds a high degree of compatibility and synergy with  the  code  of  ethics
and the conduct adopted by the department. Moreover, the ideal  correctional
official should embody the values that the department  hopes  to  instil  in
the offender as it is this same member who is to assist and  facilitate  the
rehabilitation process  of  the  offenders  and  treat  them  with  decency,
humaneness and fairness. A lack of or limited international  best  practices
that is  relevant  and  comparable  to  our  situation  presents  a  further
challenge when considering staff training  and  development  needs  for  the
realisation  of  the  new  paradigm.  Correctional  Services  has  not  been
adequately recognised as a field of  professional  practice  -  a  challenge
that is now unavoidable. The  limited  university-based  programmes  in  the
field of corrections contribute to the low development of corrections  as  a
profession.

Consequently, the bulk of the  capacity  that  the  department  requires  to
deliver services has to  be  developed  internally  and  is  hence  a  major
challenge for human resource development. The department must  also  develop
a human resource provisioning  strategy  that  would  attract  the  relevant
knowledge and skills required to deliver on this  mandate  while  doing  its
best to retain those who are in its employ. These challenges  brought  about
by renewed paradigm emphasis on correction and rehabilitation mean that  the
department needs, more than ever  before,  to  poise  itself  for  extensive
staff training, for recruitment of new personnel and for  the  retention  of
existing staff.

It is appropriate for me to restate our commitment as a department  to  good
governance  and  ensuring  compliance  with  Government   and   departmental
policies. The work  of  the  Jali  Commission,  the  investigations  of  the
Special  Investigative  Unit,  SIU,  and  the  anti-corruption  campaign   I
undertook are beginning to bear fruit in the establishment of  a  clean  and
transparent administration. The Correctional Services Act also provides  for
the establishment of  a  judicial  inspectorate  headed  by  the  Inspecting
Judge.

In our case the good work done by the hon Justice Fagan leaves  us  with  no
shadow of doubt that we are on the right track regarding  the  treatment  of
offenders. He has succeeded in pointing out the pressures we are  facing  as
a result of overcrowding in our facilities. This and other organs  of  state
keep us  on  our  toes  in  ensuring  compliance.  NGOs  and  even  ordinary
citizens,  family  and  friends  of  offenders  share  their  concerns   and
perceptions with us  and  enable  the  department's  management  to  redress
noncompliance with policy.

I  also  wish  to  express  my  gratitude  to  the  National   Council   for
Correctional Services, which is chaired by Justice  Siraj  Desai,  that  was
also established in terms of the Correctional Services Act to advise me,  as
the Minister of Correctional Services, as well  as  the  President,  on  any
matter pertaining to Correctional Services. It is  with  sadness  that  this
formidable  body  that  consists  of  professors,  criminologists,  lawyers,
social workers, psychologists, magistrates, prosecutors and police  officers
lost  one  of  their  members,  viz  Dr  Mzinyathi,  who  was   a   clinical
psychologist serving in the council, and we have  extended  our  condolences
to his family on behalf of the department and Government.

In concluding this contribution to Vote No 21, I must emphasise  that  while
we have not been able to deliver everything that we hoped to achieve in  the
past financial year, there have been successes that  were  achieved  on  our
programmes. The updated strategic plan, the  new  organisational  structure,
the White Paper process that is under way and the  commitment  of  dedicated
personnel in the  department  bode  well  for  the  development  of  a  more
effective and focused administration of the department, and facilitate  more
effective delivery on key services to offenders.

Let me take this opportunity also to thank the commissioner  Linda  Mti  and
the management and staff of this department for the hard work  they  put  in
in the process of rewriting the story of corrections in  the  transformation
of our country.  These  men  and  women  work  under  difficult  and  trying
conditions, I must say. They need to be  commended  for  a  job  well  done.
[Applause.]
I also  wish  to  express  all  the  NGOs,  the  faith-based  organisations,
community-based organisations, tertiary and other  educational  institutions
and parastatals that are always available to assist us in  the  delivery  of
our services. I am sure that most of them are here. [Applause.]

I also wish to express our greatest thanks and admiration to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Correctional Services, which is under  the  leadership  of  the
hon  member  Mashimbye.  Their  support  and  guidance  has  been  extremely
valuable for us and we shall rely on the support of all  other  stakeholders
in meeting the challenges that lie ahead, such  as  the  completion  of  the
White Paper on Correctional Services, the establishment of a  parole  board,
the implementation of  rehabilitation  programmes  that  would  require  the
training and retraining of personnel, carrying out the  HIV/Aids  prevalence
survey and the construction of new-generation prisons.

The challenge to  develop  a  scientifically-based  approach  to  correcting
offending behaviour will not be met overnight. The challenges  are  vast,  I
must say, but we are up to the challenge.

Lastly I must say,  Modimo,  Mvelinqangi,  Thixo,  Allah,  God,  bless  this
House, bless Correctional Services and bless South Africa. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Hon Minister, your  message  will  be  conveyed  to  the
Speaker, but I also hope that she was actually  listening  and  watching  on
the screen in her office to your kinds words about her in particular.

Mr J N MASHIMBYE: Madam Deputy Speaker, my name is  Ntsiki  Mashimbye.  That
was for  the  Minister.  Hon  Minister,  Deputy  Minister  for  Justice  and
Constitutional   Development,   Chief   Whip,    ladies    and    gentlemen,
rehabilitation officers, Justice Fagan, the hon Nyami Booi from the  Western
Cape asked me to say something to the rehabilitation  officers  who  are  in
the public gallery. He is very worried that they are here in numbers and  he
is worried about people escaping while they  are  here.  [Laughter.]  But  I
have assured him that in the recent past, about two or three weeks  ago,  we
had over a  thousand  prisoners  coming  from  all  parts  of  the  Republic
competing in a national choir competition. Many people  would  have  thought
that that would be a security nightmare. But, I tell you,  we  sat  in  that
hall with well over a thousand prisoners. That indicated  to  me  that  that
was rehabilitation at work. There was not a single attempted escape.  Nobody
escaped. [Applause.]

Do not worry about rehabilitation  officers  being  here.  Note  that  I  am
calling them rehabilitation officers. That is what they will be called  from
today. To indicate that the department is very serious about  rehabilitation
there has been an 8,3% increase per annum for the  work  of  rehabilitation.
The Minister has  indicated  that  the  amount  has  increased  from  R264,8
million to the current 2005-06 amount of  R427,5  million.  That  shows  the
department's serious  focus  on  rehabilitation  and  the  reintegration  of
prisoners into society.

As mentioned earlier, the Department of Correctional Services has as one  of
its key goals the placing  of  rehabilitation  at  the  centre  of  all  its
activities in partnership with all external stakeholders. One  of  the  ways
in which it seeks to do this  is  by  progressive,  ethical  management  and
staff  practices  within  which  every  correctional  official  performs  an
effective correcting and encouraging role.

It is common knowledge that prison staff need systematic knowledge  if  they
are to do their jobs effectively, ethically and sensitively. The  Department
of Correctional Services has thus embarked  upon  orientation  and  training
programmes for all departmental employees and a correctional  approach.  The
challenges faced by the correctional staff are indeed  critical  and  taxing
challenges, such as the growing privatisation of institutional  corrections,
rapid expansion in the numbers of prisons, prison staff and  prisoners,  and
dealing with more  sophisticated  drug  use  patterns  within  prison,  gang
cultures and new policies.

Consequently, correctional officials have often  displayed  high  levels  of
stress. The job of correctional official is not an enviable one.  For  those
of us on  the  outside  looking  in,  we  need  to  acknowledge  that  those
committed officials deserve our gratitude and encouragement. Just  as  there
are those dedicated and committed individuals,  there  are  also  those  who
openly flout the rules of law and engage in  corrupt  activities.  Much  has
been reported on the levels of corruption uncovered by the Jali  Commission.
Both the President and hon Minister Skhosana are to be commended  for  their
pursuance  of  transparency  and  accountability  by  appointing  the   Jali
Commission to investigate corruption and irregularities  within  our  prison
system.

The  department  has  already  begun  with   the   implementation   of   the
commission's  recommendations.  The  department  has  committed  itself   to
keeping Government abreast of developments regarding the work  of  the  Jali
Commission through the relevant structures, and will ensure that  the  South
African public is kept informed of all developments. The  department  has  a
three-pronged anticorruption strategy aimed at  investigating  mismanagement
within itself, together with the judicial inspectorate whose mandate  it  is
to deal with prisoner complaints and devise  further  strategies  to  reduce
overcrowding. The department appears quite determined to  create  a  culture
of good governance and that is very commendable.

The Portfolio Committee on Correctional Services and  the  Select  Committee
on Security and Constitutional Affairs can assure Minister Skhosana that  we
will offer all support, assistance and guidance in tackling  the  challenges
that the department currently faces. We acknowledge that the  current  White
Paper on  Correctional  Services  is  inadequate  and  fails  to  decisively
address the central problem of the correctional system in  the  Republic.  A
welcome solution to this is the formation of a task  team  which  will  work
towards the development of the Green  Paper.  Already  that  task  team  has
covered quite considerable ground  and  we  commend  them.  Relevant  policy
components to be included here  such  as  the  rehabilitation  policy,  unit
management policy, policy on aged prisoners, gender and  youth  policy  will
ensure that a single coherent policy document may be achieved.

Having said this, allow me to vehemently state  that  Correctional  Services
is but one department within the Peace  and  Security  Cluster,  and  I  was
pleased that the Deputy Minister for Justice and Constitutional  Development
was here. I had hoped that they would be here.  I  am  saying  that  because
correctional or penal reform is an all-embracing and inclusive process.  Our
present criminal justice process encompasses four core  departments,  namely
Correctional Services,  the  SA  Police  Service,  Social  Development,  and
Justice and  Constitutional  Development,  with  Correctional  Services  not
merely being the last outpost for criminal justice, but rather very  much  a
part of it.

We all need to be aware that penal reform cannot proceed without changes  to
the criminal justice system as a whole. Crime prevention  in  and  by  civil
society is essential to the success of penal reform. There  needs  to  be  a
determination  to  make  sure  that  everyone,  especially  the   poor   and
marginalised, has equal access to the justice system, and that we  recognise
that drug abuse is better dealt with inside the  health  or  social  welfare
care system rather than the criminal justice system.

It is imperative that people understand  how  courts  and  criminal  justice
system operate, and  that  there  is  openness  and  accountability  in  all
aspects of the operation of the criminal justice system.  Most  importantly,
there needs to be insistence that imprisonment should be used by  courts  as
an exception rather than a first  option,  and  that  we  cultivate  a  non-
elitist criminal justice system which treats people equally.

In acknowledgement of that assertion, I wish to report that, in  the  recent
past, during the parliamentary constituency period the Portfolio  Committees
on Justice and Correctional Services, and  some  members  of  the  Portfolio
Committee on Safety and Security, spent two weeks  visiting  areas,  centres
and  institutions  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  We  visited  courts,
prisons, police stations, detective units, forensic units, Legal Aid  Board,
institutions of social development which are relevant to our  work,  and  we
also met with the prosecuting authority.

This cluster's oversight work of parliamentary committees was  conducted  by
the three delegations in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Eastern  Cape  province.
I wish to thank all members of Parliament who participated in this  venture.
I say thank you to hon Johnny de Lange,  hon  Luwellyn  Landers  and  Sheila
Camerer. A report of this visit will  soon  find  its  way  to  this  august
House. Preliminary, however, I am able to report that it was most  rewarding
to see the criminal justice system in action.

By the time we left the provinces, it was clear to those men and  women  who
lead the criminal justice system at that level  that  those  in  the  system
have to speak to each  other.  When  the  systems  fail  to  co-operate  and
communicate, no single component of that cluster will prosper.

Some of the challenges we  observed  are  the  following:  In  dealing  with
overcrowding in our prisons we would need to implement more efficiently  the
Acts that are already  in  place,  namely  section  63(a)  of  the  Criminal
Procedure Act, which allows for amendment of the bail conditions of  certain
prisoners. In some circumstances we may need to delete  the  requirement  of
bail and substitute it with the  provision  that  offenders  may  be  placed
under the supervision of a correctional official in terms of section 62(f).

We also note that the magistrate must make use,  when  appropriate,  of  the
alternative means of sentencing ie community correctional  supervision.  May
I also recommend that at the provincial and  regional  levels,  it  will  be
appropriate to  establish  co-ordinating  forums  of  the  criminal  justice
system.

The purpose of these forums, may I suggest, should be to do  the  following:
firstly, to filter  down  policy  decisions  at  all  levels;  secondly,  to
analyse the statistics that they have collected - we have noted  that  these
statistics that they gather are  just  figures  that  are  not  analysed  to
inform future action; thirdly, to utilise  the  co-ordinating  forums  which
will not be of a decision-making nature to  interact  with  the  public  and
inform it on the achievements and challenges faced by the  criminal  justice
system; and fourthly - I would recommend  -  to  offer  incentives  such  as
rewards,  like  the  detective,  prosecutor,  magistrate  and   correctional
officer of the month. An incentive such as this will see  court  rolls  that
move faster and police dockets that do not get  lost.  We  will  see  police
dockets that are thoroughly investigated and ready for court.

As we discuss Correctional Services in the context of the  criminal  justice
cluster, let me proceed to make further recommendations.  Firstly,  we  must
urgently design a policy on national norms and  standards  for  secure  care
facilities  for  each  province.  The  role  of  the  Department  of  Social
Development will be important in this regard. Social development  will  need
a heavy budget for these secure care facilities, Mr Salojee.
Secondly, may I recommend that we need to urgently answer the question:  Who
is responsible for the welfare and education of awaiting-trial prisoners?  A
policy that is adequate  to  resolve  all  these  issues  must  be  urgently
designed. Thirdly, we recommend that the court orderlies and  security  need
to be reviewed.

Fourthly, the Department of Correctional Services  must  seriously  consider
employing more trained staff for correctional supervision. This is  an  area
on which we have to focus, so we need personnel for that. I am aware of  the
budgetary implications.

Fifthly,  the  integrated  justice  system  has  to  be   implemented   more
enthusiastically. In most parts within the Gauteng province, the  integrated
justice system has not been implemented. May we  further  recommend  that  a
senior policeman or woman  be  deployed  in  an  integrated  justice  system
office to make sure that dockets are ready for trial.

Finally, the last recommendation that needs  the  attention  of  the  Police
Service is an urgent review of the structure of  the  detective  units.  Our
view is that the detective structure must be designed in such a way that  it
can retain the best detectives, and that  detectives  can  grow  within  the
structures. The detectives  should  not  run  to  greener  pastures  in  the
uniformed police units.

The biggest challenge that our nation faces is to reconcile itself with  the
fact that offenders are human. Offenders are our sons and daughters  and  we
have the responsibility to make certain that when  they  leave  our  prisons
they do not come back.

In conclusion, it is obvious by now that the dimensions of  a  proper  penal
policy depend on  an  intricate  blend  of  value  judgement  and  empirical
information. Most importantly,  the  penal  policy  adopted  by  society  is
perhaps the most telling indication of the integrity of  society  itself.  A
prominent researcher once noted  that  it  should  be  the  objective  of  a
civilised and progressive society to devise methods of punishment  which  do
not deny the human qualities of  the  offender,  because  a  denial  of  his
humanity carries with it a denial of society itself. [Applause.]

Mr F  J  VAN  DEVENTER:  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Department  of  Correctional
Services is  different  from  other  state  departments.  When  judging  the
performance of this department,  there  are  a  few  facts  that  cannot  be
ignored. In the first place, the customers of this department are not  there
because they are role models who uphold the acceptable norms and  values  of
a normal, disciplined society. On the contrary, they are there because  they
are in conflict with those norms and values. Secondly, they  are  not  there
at the invitation of the department or because they have  a  sincere  desire
to undergo rehabilitation programmes to help them adapt  to  a  normal  law-
abiding life.

Dit is 'n algemene gebruik by langtermyn- en gewoontemisdadigers om hul  eie
sosiale orde binne gevangenisse te vorm met 'n eie gesagstruktuur. Die  doel
hiervan is nie om gevangenisowerhede te help nie, maar eerder om hulle  taak
so moeilik as moontlik te maak, want statutêre gesagstrukture word dan  deur
die  gesagstrukture  wat  gevangenes  self  skep,  uitgedaag.   Terwyl   die
statutêre  gesagstrukture  onderhewig  is  aan  grondwetlike,   wetlike   en
departementele voorskrifte wat gedrag en optrede van  personeel  bepaal,  is
daar niks wat die gesagstruktuur wat gevangenes self skep,  kontroleer  nie.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is a general practice for  long-term  and  habitual  criminals  to  form
their own social order, with its own structure  of  authority,  in  prisons.
The aim of this is not to help prison authorities, but rather to make  their
task as difficult as possible, because  structures  of  statutory  authority
are then challenged by the structures of authority created by the  prisoners
themselves. Whereas the structures of statutory  authority  are  subject  to
constitutional, statutory and  departmental  regulations  to  determine  the
behaviour and conduct of staff, there is nothing to  control  the  structure
of authority created by the prisoners themselves.]

Against this background, a better understanding  of  the  enormous  task  of
this department  may  arise.  The  serious  overcrowding  in  South  African
prisons - whose  capacity  is  110  874  while  they  must  handle  187  748
prisoners, of whom 131 604  are  convicted  and  58  144  awaiting  trial  -
amounts to overcrowding of 71,1%  and  puts  an  unbearable  burden  on  the
Department of Correctional Services.

The overcrowding in South African prisons  is  of  such  a  serious  nature,
especially  when  the  circumstances  arising  from  it   are   taken   into
consideration, that it can be  seen  as  a  contravention  of  the  Bill  of
Rights. I believe that all of us in this Parliament are serious  and  honest
in our efforts to protect human dignity and individual rights.  If  that  is
true, there is no way in which we can defend the conditions in  our  prisons
which result from overcrowding.

What is even more serious, whatever the reasons may be, is to  put  a  state
department in a position that makes it nearly impossible for  it  to  uphold
the Bill of Rights. Furthermore, it puts enormous pressure on the budget  of
the Department of Correctional Services. As a  labour-intensive  department,
R4,9 billion or 64% of the R7,6 billion budget goes towards the  payment  of
salaries of employees; and with the remaining 36%  it  is  expected  of  the
department to build prisons, provide  health  care  and  other  professional
services, feed people properly,  and  pay  for  electricity,  water  and  so
forth.

The Department of Correctional Services cannot take the blame  for  this  by
itself. The other two departments in the peace and security cluster,  namely
Justice and Safety and Security are stakeholders in this  mess.  Unless  the
three Ministers get their act together, no problems will be  solved  and  we
will be listing the same concerns in this House next year. Perhaps the  time
has come for the three Ministers to visit prisons together to  see  what  is
going on. Mr  Minister,  I  think  you  must  send  an  invitation  to  your
colleagues in the judicial cluster to go with you  and  see  for  themselves
what the situation in South African prisons is.

The talkative Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development - it  is  a
pity he is not here, but that shows his interest in this debate; I  saw  him
on Wednesday, and he likes to watch his own performance  on  the  television
screen to my left when he talks from his bench  -  cannot  just  sweep  this
issue from the table as  if  he  has  nothing  to  do  with  it.  Since  his
appointment as Minister of Justice and  Constitutional  Development  he  has
bombarded this Parliament with  promises  on  how  he  would  transform  the
Department of Justice, especially the courts, in  order  to  cope  with  the
huge backlog of awaiting-trial prisoners.

Despite all these promises  and  transformation,  more  than  52,5%  of  the
available prison capacity is occupied by  persons  awaiting  trial.  If  the
Government and this Parliament want to keep South Africa on the front  pages
of the written media and out  of  the  news  headlines  as  a  country  that
breaches its own Bill of Rights, then, surely, the allocation  of  funds  to
the three departments in that cluster must be revised.  The  alternative  is
that the Minister of Justice and  Constitutional  Development  gets  himself
and his department in gear to cope with their responsibilities.

The Inspecting Judge, Justice Fagan, referred in  a  press  statement  to  a
possible general amnesty or mass presidential pardon to relieve the  problem
of overcrowding. The DA cannot support such a wide suggestion. It sends  the
wrong message to intended evildoers and it creates  a  perception  that  the
Government is not serious about fighting crime. Justice Fagan also  referred
to the mass release of minor offenders who cannot  pay  bail  under  section
65(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act which was passed in Parliament in  2001.
Mr Minister, why is the  department  not  using  this  Act  to  relieve  the
pressure  of  overcrowding,   and   if   it   is   not   your   department's
responsibility, whose it is and when will it come into operation?

Daar  is  sekerlik  talle  ander  sake  waaroor  gepraat  kan   word,   soos
byvoorbeeld  die  behandeling  van  MIV-positiewe  gevangenes,  kinders   in
gevangenisse, korrupsie,  misdaad,  bendes,  terminaal  siekes,  mediese  en
sielkundige versorging, vrouegevangenes met klein kindertjies en vele  meer.
Ek is egter daarvan oortuig dat as die departement nie daarin kan  slaag  om
watter rede ookal om die gevangenisbevolking binne perke te bring,  dan  kan
hy nie sy opgelegte verpligting behoorlik nakom nie.

Dit is eenvoudig nie moontlik om sinvolle  rehabilitasie  te  doen,  wanneer
mense op mekaar se tone moet trap  as  hulle  van  hul  beddens  afklim,  as
gevolg van oorbevolking  in  hul  verblyfplekke  nie.  Die  Departement  van
Justisie en waar ter  sake,  Veiligheid  en  Sekuriteit,  sal  eenvoudig  'n
groter verantwoordelikheid moet aanvaar ten opsigte van die kostes  verbonde
aan   verhoorafwagtende   gevangenes.    Diesulkes    is    en    sal    die
verantwoordelikheid  bly  van  al  die  departemente  wat   deel   van   die
strafregstelsel uitmaak.

Ek wil kortliks 'n baie ernstige saak aanraak en dit is  die  implementering
van resolusie 7. En ek bring dit hier te berde, omdat dit te  doen  het  met
personeel van Korrektiewe dienste, asook van ander departemente. Ek  wil  'n
baie ernstige beroep op die Minister doen om indringend ondersoek  te  doen,
veral in die Oos-Kaap, oor die toepassing van resolusie 7.  Volgens  wat  ek
meegedeel  is,  word  dit  op  'n  uiters  ontwrigtende   manier   toegepas.
Huisgesinne word benadeel, kinders en eiendom en in  sommige  gevalle  selfs
huwelike word  nie  in  ag  geneem  nie.  Eers  was  dit  lede  van  die  SA
Polisiedienste in die Oos-Kaap en  nou  is  dit  personeel  van  Korrektiewe
Dienste wat onder hierdie  ongevoelige  toepassing  van  resolusie  7  gebuk
gaan. Dit is ernstig. Dit is 'n ernstige knou vir  die  moraliteit  van  die
personeel en ek wil regtig dringend vra dat  daar  baie  vinnig  na  hierdie
situasie gekyk word. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[There are certainly many other matters that can be discussed, for  instance
the treatment of HIV-positive prisoners, children  in  prisons,  corruption,
crime, gangs, terminal illnesses, medical  and  psychological  care,  female
prisoners with small children, and many more. I am, however, convinced  that
if the department cannot succeed in  limiting  the  prison  population,  for
whatever reason,  then  it  cannot  meet  the  obligation  entrusted  to  it
properly.

It is simply not  possible  to  engage  in  meaningful  rehabilitation  when
people literally have to tread on one another's toes when they  get  out  of
bed as a result of overcrowding in their dwelling-places. The Department  of
Justice and, where relevant,  Safety  and  Security,  will  simply  have  to
accept greater responsibility regarding the costs associated with  awaiting-
trial prisoners. People like these are and will  remain  the  responsibility
of all the departments which form part of the judicial system.

I want to  touch  briefly  on  a  very  serious  matter,  and  that  is  the
implementation of resolution  7.  And  I  am  raising  it  here  because  it
involves  the  staff  of  Correctional  Services,  as  well  as   of   other
departments. I want to  make  a  very  urgent  appeal  to  the  Minister  to
undertake an in-depth investigation, especially in the  Eastern  Cape,  into
the implementation of resolution 7. According to what I have been  told,  it
is being implemented in an extremely disruptive manner. Families  are  being
prejudiced, children and property and in some cases even marriages  are  not
taken into consideration. At first it was  the  members  of  the  SA  Police
Service in the Eastern Cape and now it is  staff  of  Correctional  Services
who are being adversely  affected  by  this  insensitive  implementation  of
resolution 7. This is serious. It is a serious blow to staff morale,  and  I
want to ask really urgently that this situation should  be  looked  at  very
quickly.]

The way in which the Department of Correctional Services is treated  by  the
Government creates the impression that this department is  a  necessary  and
affordable waste. Any intelligent person with  a  sense  of  good  judgement
will  agree  that  the  department  cannot  function  properly  under   such
circumstances. Therefore, the DA will object to this Vote,  not  because  of
the Minister or the Director-General or the staff  of  this  department  but
because it is impossible for us to deliver a quality service to  the  public
of South Africa due to the uncaring  attitude  of  Government  towards  this
very complex department. [Applause.]

Mr N B FIHLA: Hon Deputy Speaker, hon  Minister  of  Correctional  Services,
hon members, the argument that prisoners are sent to  prison  as  punishment
and not for punishment has been repeated quite often in recent  years.  What
we can categorically state, is that although  imprisonment  is  enforced  by
containment of  an  individual  in  a  closed  environment,  it  should  not
contribute to damaging effects on the  health  and  human  rights  of  those
persons.

However, it is unfortunate that this is indeed  the  case  in  many  of  the
world's  prisons.  All  human  beings,  prisoners  included,  have   certain
inalienable rights which are recognised and acknowledged by  internationally
recognised instruments. Human rights treaties make  states  accountable  for
the way they act and fail to act.

The history of prisons in South Africa has been notorious for  the  kind  of
punishment it meted out to inmates. Under the rules  of  apartheid,  prisons
were managed along military lines and were closed institutions.  During  the
struggle  years,  incarceration  of  political   detainees   and   sentenced
political prisoners became a  central  feature  of  South  African  prisons.
Gross human rights violations were frequent and brutal.  Physical  assaults,
particularly of political prisoners, were common and warders  who  inflicted
these types of punishment were not prevented from doing so.  At  the  height
of the struggle, detainees were held for up to two  years  or  more  without
being charged.

Overcrowding compounded the dehumanising conditions of imprisonment  and  in
August 1992 the Human Rights Watch  found  that  Pollsmoor  Prison  was  97%
overcrowded. There were no beds and most prisoners slept on  the  floormats.
There were reports of torture and ill-treatment in  police  custody  and  in
prisons. Between January and December 1992 more than 100 deaths  in  custody
were reported.

After the release of Comrade Nelson Mandela and the unbanning of the ANC  in
the early 1990s,  a  decision  was  taken  to  restructure  and  reform  the
department. The significant name change from the Department  of  Prisons  to
the Department of Correctional Services implied that the  transformation  of
the department, from a merely punitive institution to one that sought to  be
accountable, restorative and transparent, was indeed a step forward.

The  democratic  elections  in  1994  highlighted  the  ANCs  commitment  to
transform South  African  society  at  all  levels.  The  RDP  document,  in
addition to focusing on nonracism and nonsexism,  emphasised  human  rights,
the rehabilitation of offenders as well as the effective  implementation  of
demilitarisation. Demilitarisation was seen as one further aid in  advancing
rehabilitation. It involved changing the structure, ranks  system  and  mode
of address of prison  officers,  removal  of  insignia,  and  halting  daily
military parades.

During  1997,  the  national  Parliament  passed  a  number  of  laws   with
significance for human rights. The Correctional Services Act  of  1998  also
addressed representivity and equity, shifts to  a  balance  between  secure,
human custody and rehabilitation; and the adoption  of  unit  management  of
prisons and a code of conduct. However, despite such laudable  changes,  the
department still faces enormous challenges. The increase in  the  number  of
awaiting-trial prisoners has meant  that  there  are  twice  the  number  of
prisoners in any given communal cell.

Illegal drug trafficking amongst inmates  and  in  some  instances  warders,
gang proliferation, violent  acts  such  as  sodomy,  prisoner  on  prisoner
violence, decaying physical  infrastructure,  guard  abuse,  corruption  and
lack of medical care  have  continued  unabated  within  the  Department  of
Correctional Services. The  current  budget  attempts  to  make  inroads  to
contain these dilemmas by making financial provision for 36  189  personnel,
183  000  prisoners  and  70  000  probationers.  Yet,  despite  these  very
courageous efforts, we are faced with the situation of  the  total  prisoner
population  reaching  approximately  209  000  in  2003-04,  with   78   000
probationers and parolees.

Overcrowding is set to increase to 85,4% in 2003-04, 99,74% in 2004-05,  and
93,37% in 2005-06 - an alarming situation for any society to be faced  with.
With overcrowding comes the inevitable accompanying factor of the  spreading
of diseases. Risky lifestyles can lead to the transmission of diseases  from
prisoner to prisoner and pose a serious public  health  risk  if  unchecked.
Contracting any disease in prison is not  part  of  a  prisoner's  sentence.
This fact becomes even more significant  when  the  disease  is  potentially
fatal, as is the case with HIV/Aids. This leads us  to  consider  the  basic
rights of the prisoner.

In comparison to offender control  expenditure,  health  and  physical  care
will grow slowly. On average, the allocation for health  and  physical  care
will increase by 4,8% annually over the medium term, which  is  almost  half
of the spending allocated to incarceration. According to the  Department  of
Correctional  Services,  while  there  has  been  some  improvement  in  the
provision of health care services to prisoners, it is  still  difficult  for
prisoners to gain access to overstretched provincial health facilities.

The department also faces the challenge of the increased impact of  HIV/Aids
on health care delivery. This is made all  the  more  critical  when  prison
gangs have resorted to a new technique to punish  members  who  break  their
rules: HIV infection by rape. It is a  terrifying  prospect  where  an  HIV-
infected prisoner is used to infect another because of the  latter's  nonco-
operation. This is termed ``the slow  puncture''.  This  practice,  although
not yet widespread, will only make matters worse.

In democratic societies such as ours the  law  underpins  and  protects  the
fundamental values of society. The most important of these  is  respect  for
the inherent dignity of  all  human  beings,  whatever  their  personal  and
social status. One of the greatest tests of this respect for  humanity  lies
in the way in which a society treats those who have broken  or  are  accused
of having broken the law. These are people  who  themselves  may  well  have
shown a lack of respect for the dignity and rights of others. Thus it  falls
on prison staff who, on behalf of the rest of society, play a  special  role
in respecting the dignity of criminal offenders,  despite  the  severity  of
any crime they may have committed.

This principle of respect for all human beings,  whatever  the  wrongs  they
might have committed, was articulated  by  our  former  President  and  once
famous prisoner, Comrade Nelson Mandela. He said and I quote:


  ... no one truly knows a nation until one has been inside  the  jails.  A
  nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens but its
  lowest ones.

His words should be the basis for the ethical and  professional  conduct  of
prison management and prison staff and all those  who  are  responsible  for
the administration of prisons. Without an  ethical  framework  and  context,
our prisons will become more like concentration camps  than  an  environment
of rehabilitation.
We paid a visit to Port Elizabeth and we were led by  Comrade  De  Lange.  I
think that that was a very revealing and interesting visit  because  he  was
able to identify the problems of overcrowding and was  able  to  effectively
address them immediately on the spot by applying sections 63  and  62(f)  of
the Act. And it was very interesting how he was able to  apply  the  law  on
the spot and deal with the magistrates and the prosecutors. I think if  that
can be applied throughout the country and if the justice system is  able  to
do that, as we are doing in these cluster visits to  various  areas,  it  is
going to be very effective. [Applause.]

Mr E  T  FERREIRA:  Madam  Speaker,  the  Minister  and  the  Department  of
Correctional Services should be congratulated on the  good  work  that  they
have been doing in difficult  conditions  and  with  the  limited  resources
available to them. We are especially  pleased  with  the  progress  that  is
being made in the effort to root out corruption  and  corrupt  officials  in
the department. We hope that they keep up the  good  work  and  abolish  the
corrupt element within the department.
We know that Government is very sensitive  as  regards  making  public  news
that portrays it in a negative light, as they do  not  want  to  create  any
negative perceptions about the country. We do, however,  urge  the  Minister
and the department to give as much publicity  as  possible  to  the  way  in
which they are rooting out the bad apples in their  midst.  This  will  give
the general public more confidence in the department  as  they  see  corrupt
officials  being  removed  and  it  will  indicate  to  potentially  corrupt
officials that they should rather seek employment elsewhere.

An amount of R7,6 billion has been  allocated  to  the  department  in  this
budget. This is an increase of 9,27% on last year's allocation.  The  budget
of the department has grown at an annual average of  9,9%  over  the  seven-
year period from 1999-2000 to 2005-06. If one considers that  the  inflation
rate for this particular period is likely to be below  9,9%,  then  we  must
acknowledge that there will be a real growth in the  Correctional  Services'
budget, albeit a small growth. Even though Government may  not  be  spending
enough on the Department of Correctional Services, and I think  we  are  all
agreed on that, they need to be praised for at least  moving  in  the  right
direction, albeit slowly. The allocations to the department have, thus  far,
mostly been slightly ahead of the inflation  rate  and  we  hope  that  this
trend will at least continue.

The overcrowding of prisons has a major effect  on  the  department's  costs
and performance. We have almost 188 000 people in our prisons,  whereas  our
capacity is for just over 110 000 prisoners - that is  a  well  known  fact.
The major overcrowding problem needs to be addressed as a matter of  extreme
urgency and we seem to talk about it year after year but when one  looks  at
the figures every year, it does not really seem like we are getting there.

We hope that  the  co-operation  with  other  departments  involved  in  the
integrated justice system regarding awaiting-trial  prisoners  and  Saturday
court projects will achieve their stated  aim  of  reducing  the  number  of
awaiting-trial and presentenced prisoners.  We  simply  have  to  bring  the
figure of almost 60 000 awaiting-trial prisoners down quite dramatically.

The idea of releasing people on bail of R1 000 or less is not necessarily  a
bad one, because if these people were not poor and  at  the  bottom  end  of
society like most of them are they would, in any case, not be  in  jail,  as
the bail amount is easily payable in  respect  of  middle  and  upper  class
people. One would, however, hope that a problem will  not  arise  afterwards
where a large percentage of these people do not  turn  up  for  their  court
cases. One always has that risk factor, of course, when one releases  people
on low bail.

We in South Africa have two options. We can either  keep  on  building  more
jails, as is the case in the United  States,  or  we  can  find  alternative
sentencing methods to keep up with the  ever-increasing  prison  population.
In principle, the IFP is not opposed to alternative sentencing. Our  problem
is with the  implementation  of  alternative  sentencing  methods.  A  large
number of prisoners have been sentenced because  they  have  committed  very
serious crimes such as murder, rape and  robbery.  It  is  highly  debatable
whether people like that should ever be considered  as  far  as  alternative
sentencing is concerned.

We understand that prisoners are also human beings and should be treated  as
such. So, the issue has to be looked at in a very humane way.  The  question
has to be asked, though, whether it will be cheaper and  more  practical  to
use alternative sentencing methods as opposed to incarceration.  Alternative
sentencing could, in any case,  only  work  if  done  effectively  from  the
outset. One cannot get away with, for example, understaffing in  alternative
sentencing, as is the case in incarceration. Now, we all agree  that  prison
cells should not be overcrowded and one has understaffing. But, at least  if
people are incarcerated and one has understaffing, the people are  at  least
still in prison and being punished for what they have done.

The moment one runs into staff shortages and things  like  that  as  far  as
alternative sentencing is concerned, then one runs  into  the  problem  that
one is not really punishing people. For instance, I know of a case  in  Port
Elizabeth where a man  was  caught  for  drunken  driving  on  a  number  of
occasions, and I think that the last time he was caught was the fifth  time.
He is under correctional supervision and this includes house  arrest,  where
he has to be at home between six in the evening and six  the  next  morning.
Because there are not enough parole officers and  correctional  officers  to
check on him, he basically gets checked on once in six or eight  weeks.  One
then starts asking the question: ``Is this man really serving any kind of  a
sentence or not?''

It was  reported  recently  that  there  was  an  incident  where  only  one
permanent social worker dealt with 800 offenders. In cases like that, if  it
is  true,  a  large  number  of  offenders   are   left   unsupervised   and
unrehabilitated and could in future, of course, commit similar offences.

If  alternative  sentencing  is  not  properly   staffed,   supervised   and
controlled, it could cause more harm than good.  A  great  deal  of  thought
should be given to finding a suitable solution to the  overcrowding  of  our
prisons, either through building additional prisons, alternative  sentencing
or a combination of the two - which is probably the way we need to go.

The early release of prisoners on special days or on  special  occasions  is
practised in countries all around the world. Now, we  know  that  when  that
happens next year there is probably going to be a big  hullabaloo  about  it
but it is only  because  it  is  South  Africa.  If  presidents  from  other
countries buy planes it is not a big problem because it  is  acceptable  and
normal. But if the South African President buys a plane then there  is  hell
to pay. In any case, we, as the IFP, are not opposed to this  practise,  but
the manner in which it is conducted and the prisoners that are selected  for
early release  are,  of  course,  of  utmost  importance.  We  must  not  be
confronted with a similar situation to that of last year or earlier where  a
prisoner who was granted a  presidential  pardon  committed  a  murder  soon
after his release. The way in which the whole process is  conducted  has  to
be dealt with very carefully.
We have no problem if women  with  children,  the  aged  and  the  sick  are
considered favourably with regard to their early  release.  This  does  not,
however, mean that they must be treated  any  differently,  with  regard  to
sentencing, from other criminals who  have  committed  similar  crimes.  Any
person who commits a crime must pay for their transgressions. That  must  be
non-negotiable. Whether a person is fat or  thin,  young  or  old,  male  or
female, if he commits a horrendous crime he must pay for  it  and  not  come
along with sob stories afterwards.

There are many problems that the  department  has  to  deal  with  and  many
obstacles to be overcome. We believe that the department  is  on  the  right
track and is doing a good job and the many obstacles and problems facing  it
can and will be overcome. [Applause.]

Ms E NGALEKA: Chairperson, hon Ministers, comrades and friends,  ladies  and
gentlemen, allow me to quote from the Freedom Charter, as follows:


  No one shall be imprisoned, deported or restricted without a fair  trial.
  No one shall be condemned by the order of any Government official.

South Africa has the highest proportion of prisoners of  any  state  in  the
world. This is because there are so many petty infringements  to  which  the
penalty of imprisonment is attached. In  a  new  South  Africa  imprisonment
will only be for serious crimes against the people and will be aimed at  re-
education, not vengeance.

Flowing from the Freedom Charter, the Bill of Rights  came  into  being  and
emphasised human dignity and respect for  human  rights.  The  ANC  supports
this Vote.

Correctional Services, as the  last  destination  of  the  criminal  justice
system,  has  very  little  control  over  its  intake.  The  Department  of
Correctional Services is charged with receiving offenders who have  been  or
are going through the criminal justice system. But  the  decision  regarding
sentencing, which determines how long they will be  in  prison,  rests  with
the magistrates and the judges. What is of concern is that  there  seems  to
be very little regard by some members of the judiciary for the  consequences
of their decisions, regarding prisons.

The cause of overcrowding is the  unprecedented  growth  in  the  number  of
unsentenced prisoners. The  average  period  that  an  unsentenced  prisoner
remains  in  prison  has  increased  even  more  dramatically.  The  current
capacity of South African prisons is approximately 111  000  prisoners,  but
presently we have a prison population of close to 188 000.  This  translates
into overcrowding by approximately 79 000, of which  58  000  are  awaiting-
trial prisoners and cost taxpayers R94 per person per day.

Overcrowding in itself results  in  low  staff  morale,  unbearable  working
conditions, unbearable living conditions for prisoners, prisoners having  to
sleep in shifts, prisoners not being provided with three meals per  day  and
the collapse of infrastructure. It is also a health hazard because  at  some
prisons one toilet is being shared by 60  prisoners,  which  is  a  breeding
ground for numerous infectious diseases.

This also has an effect on the rehabilitation programme, as a result of  the
lack of space and shortage of professional staff to assess and  rehabilitate
prisoners. The department is  charged  with  the  responsibility  to  create
conditions for a prisoner to take full responsibility for his or  her  life,
develop self-respect, self-confidence and actively strive for  a  life  free
of crime.

In line with our democratic and human rights culture, one is assumed  to  be
innocent until proven guilty. The huge number  of  awaiting-trial  prisoners
in our prisons is of great  concern.  Approximately  19  000  prisoners  are
awaiting trial in prisons because they cannot afford bail which ranges  from
R50 to R1 000. Because these people  are  poor,  they  are  left  there  and
sometimes forgotten.

The Bill of Rights states that every child has a right not to  be  detained,
except as a measure of last resort,  in  which  case,  in  addition  to  the
rights a child enjoys under sections 12 and 35, the child  may  be  detained
only for the shortest appropriate period of time and has a right to be  kept
separate from detained persons  over  the  age  of  eighteen  years  and  be
treated in a manner that takes into account the child's age.

Is our justice system equipped to realise  these  objectives?  Currently  we
have a large number of children in prison. There are  a  number  of  reasons
for this. Among other reasons are, that some of the  children  in  detention
have no fixed address, they have no means to pay bail, they have no  parents
or guardians to take custody of them, and some  parents  do  not  even  have
money to pay taxi or bus fare to go to court.

These  factors  demonstrate  that   children   in   prison   are   not   the
responsibility  of  Correctional  Services  only,  but   also   a   societal
responsibility. In  our  efforts  to  achieve  moral  regeneration  children
should be the highest priority.

I want to dedicate a poem by Ingrid Jonker to all mothers who have  children
in prison. The poem is called ``Ma'', which means ``Mother''.

Ma, ek skryf vir jou 'n gedig
sonder fensie leestekens
sonder bywoorde
net sommer 'n kaalvoet gedig -

want jy maak my groot
in jou krom klein handjies
jy beitel my met jou swart oë
en spits woorde
jy draai jou leiklipkop
jy lag en breek my tente op
maar jy offer my elke aand
vir jou Here God.
jou moesie-oor is my enigste telefoon
jou huis my enigste bybel
jou naam my breekwater teen die lewe

ek is so jammer mamma
dat ek nie is
wat ek graag vir jou wil wees nie.
Abazali  abanabantwana  ezintolongweni   mabangabalahli   abantwana,   kwaye
bangaphelelwa lithemba. URhulumente we-ANC  uzimisele  ukuncedisana  nabantu
abangakwaziyo  ukuhlawulela  amagqwetha.  (Translation  of  Xhosa  paragraph
follows.)

[Parents who have children in prison, should not abandon them,  they  should
not lose hope. The  ANC-led  Government  is  committed  to  assisting  those
people who cannot afford legal fees.]

The Departments of  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development,  Correctional
Services and SA  Police  Service  are  moving  towards  a  fully  integrated
system. However, this  integration  takes  place  only  at  ministerial  and
senior official levels. It has not yet filtered down to  lower  levels.  Our
recent trip to KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape  and  Gauteng  demonstrated  this
fact. It also highlighted the need for the system  to  be  fully  integrated
even at local level. The benefits  of  having  a  fully  integrated  justice
system have been mentioned by a few of my colleagues, so I  will  not  dwell
on them.

It was a historic event when three portfolio  committees  went  on  a  joint
visit in this cluster. Because of the joint visit, the cluster will be  able
to address overcrowding successfully. Before  this  joint  visit  we  had  a
situation in which one department blamed  the  other,  with  no  one  taking
responsibility for overcrowding.

Overcrowding is counterproductive for everyone because huge  sums  of  money
are spent on keeping unsentenced prisoners in jail. These resources  can  be
spent on  rehabilitation,  education  and  service  improvement.  To  reduce
crime, we are accountable to the public and state  in  order  to  render  an
accessible, fair,  speedy  and  cost-effective  system  of  justice  in  the
interests of a safer and more secure South Africa. We will achieve  this  by
integrating  the  management  of  cases  and  offenders  through  the   four
departments, supported by the necessary enabling technology.

There are two ways of reducing the number of awaiting-trial prisoners to  an
acceptable 20 000. Firstly, we need to reduce the inflow of  prisoners  from
the courts and, secondly, to get those prisoners  who  are  in  prison  out.
This can be done by implementing legislation and methods provided,  such  as
pretrial diversion - especially for juveniles - and through greater  use  by
police of their powers to release arrested persons on bail.

Parole is the release of a prisoner after serving a specific portion of  his
or her sentence under continued monitoring by the state in  conditions  that
permit limited freedom in the community. We want to urge the  Department  of
Correctional Services to ensure that the parole boards are inclusive of  all
identified role-players, especially community representatives.

Conditions of  overcrowding,  gangsterism,  staff  who  are  not  adequately
trained to deal effectively with the  transformation  process  and  low  job
satisfaction necessitated the introduction  of  a  more  effective  tool  to
manage prisoners, that is unit management. In many ways, unit management  is
therefore a shift from a depersonalised and centralised approach.

Former President, Comrade Mandela, had this to  say  about  the  department,
and I quote:


  The way society treats its prisoners is one of the  sharpest  reflections
  of its character. In the prisons of  apartheid  the  inhumanity  of  that
  system was starkly evident. We have inherited a  system  ill-equipped  to
  serve the needs of a democratic society founded on  a  culture  of  human
  rights.


  We recall these facts, not to dwell on the past,  but  to  underline  the
  fact that as we transform our society,  the  Department  of  Correctional
  Services faces a great challenge.

I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mr J DURAND: Chairperson, right at the outset I would like  to  congratulate
the Minister and the national commissioner. The Department  of  Correctional
Services that we experience  today  is  not  the  department  that  I  first
experienced when I was elected by my party to the committee on  correctional
services in 1999. It was then a department paralysed, to a  certain  extent,
by corruption and maladministration.

What has been exposed by the Jali  Commission  now  is  to  a  large  extent
because of the work the  Minister  has  done  with  the  assistance  of  the
national commissioner. For that, I think the country owes the  Minister  our
greatest  appreciation  and  also  wishes  him  well  in  implementing   the
recommendations and dealing  with  the  findings  of  the  Jali  Commission.
[Applause.]

To Justice Fagan, we say thank you very much for what he is doing. Not  only
does he react to complaints promptly, but he also comes  forward  with  very
innovative suggestions on how to solve them and for that we are greatly  and
tremendously grateful. [Applause.]

The booklet, The Department of  Correctional  Services  Strategic  Plan  for
2003/2004, 2005/2006, has an inscription on its  front  cover  which  reads,
and I quote:
  From every official becoming a rehabilitator to every prison  becoming  a
  correctional centre, a place of new beginning; every offender becoming  a
  nation server through correction.

By stating this the department has set itself  higher  goals  than  that  of
minders of criminals. It commits itself to the continuous efforts to  assist
in the moral regeneration of South Africa. It pledges to the people of  this
country that it will investigate and root out  corruption  in  our  midst  -
corruption and maladministration which were so clearly exposed by  the  Jali
Commission.

It must place rehabilitation in the centre of its activities by  envisioning
a department that will ensure care and development, and give  guarantees  to
the nation that offenders will never return to prison. The  department  must
thus focus its activities to  ensure  that  through  constant  training  and
renewal it will equip its personnel with the right mix of skills to  achieve
the goal of rehabilitation and  not  of  cruel  and  inhumane  custody.  The
offenders should become rehabilitators and the officials should  not  become
offenders.

The department must assist in the creation of a collective sense  of  social
responsibility. In the words of Minister Ben Skosana: ``The department  does
not create offenders. They  come  from  society.''  I  agree  with  you,  Mr
Minister. They visit their antisocial behaviour on our innocent victims  who
are mostly women and children who suffer because of this. We need  a  social
compact. We must build  quality  and  lasting  partnerships  with  business,
communities, NGOs, CBOs and other Government departments to enable us  as  a
nation to deal with the issue of crime.

Overcrowding in our prisons  is  a  serious  problem  that  impacts  on  the
department's  ability  to  achieve   its   goals   of   safe   custody   and
rehabilitation. The  advice  of  Justice  Fagan,  the  Inspecting  Judge  of
Prisons, is correct and should be taken to heart.

Volgens Regter Fagan het oorbevolking,  wat  tans  op  70%  staan,  kritieke
afmetings begin aanneem. Van Suid-Afrika se meer as  190 000  gevangenes  is
ongeveer 60 000 verhoorafwagtend. Sedert Maart  vanjaar  was  daar  ongeveer
20 000 aan wie daar borgtog toegestaan is, maar wat  dit  nie  kon  bekostig
nie.

Dit is duidelik dat die situasie nou desperaat genoeg  is  om  noodmaatreëls
in te stel. Die publiek betaal ten duurste om geweldsmisdadigers van kos  en
verblyf te voorsien terwyl hulle in aanhouding is. Hierdie groep van 20  000
gevangenes wat nie borgtog kan bekostig nie, kan  mos  op  parool  of  onder
korrektiewe toesig  vrygelaat  word.  Dit  sal  die  druk  van  oorbevolking
verlig. Rehabilitasie en beheer in  gevangenisse  is  nie  moontlik  in  die
huidige omstandighede nie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[According to Justice Fagan, overcrowding, which at present amounts to  70%,
has started to assume critical proportions.  Approximately  60  000  of  the
more than 190 000 prisoners in South Africa are awaiting trial. Since  March
this year approximately 20 000 prisoners were granted  bail  but  could  not
afford to pay it.

It is clear  that  the  situation  is  now  desperate  enough  to  institute
emergency measures. The public is paying a very high price to  provide  food
and accommodation for violent prisoners while they are  in  custody.  Surely
this group of 20 000 prisoners  who  cannot  afford  to  pay  bail,  can  be
paroled or released under  correctional  supervision.  This  will  ease  the
pressure of overcrowding. Rehabilitation and  control  in  prisons  are  not
possible under the present circumstances.]

Under  these  conditions,  petty  criminals  become  hardened  criminals  in
prisons which have become the universities of crime. The public pays  twice.
It first pays when criminal acts are visited on them and secondly when  they
have to finance the board and lodging of  these  antisocial  criminals.  The
death penalty should be brought back for  certain  serious  violent  crimes.
Years after the April 1994 elections, the conditions in  our  prisons  still
fell  far  short  of  the  stated  aims.  Some  prisoners  endured  dreadful
treatment due to overcrowded and understaffed prisons.

On April 2000, the 236 prisons  built  to  accommodate  more  than  100  000
prisoners were accommodating over 172 000 prisoners. That meant  that  about
72  000  prisoners  were  being  kept  in  prison  without   the   necessary
infrastructure such as toilets, beds, showers, etc being available to  them.
This was worsened by the uneven distribution  of  prisoners  which  resulted
from the need for separate  facilities  for  gender  and  other  categories.
While a few prisons were less than 100% occupied, many were  over  200%  and
one was almost 400% occupied.

The latest report of the Inspecting judge says that  our  prisons  hold  188
000 prisoners, 70% more than the 120 000 for which they were designed.  This
overcrowding is costing the state R80 million  a  day.  There  are  no  more
funds  available  for  building  more  prisons.   Alternative   methods   of
correction must be sought. The gross overcrowding in prisons today  has  led
to detention under  horrendous  conditions,  especially  for  awaiting-trial
prisoners.

The cause of the overcrowding was the unprecedented growth in the number  of
awaiting-trial prisoners.  While  the  sentenced  prison  population  slowly
increased from over 92 000 in January 1995 to just over  108  000  in  April
2000, the number of awaiting-trial prisoners almost trebled from 24  000  in
January 1995 to over 60 000 in April 2000. The average period that awaiting-
trial prisoners remained in prison increased even  more  dramatically.  Over
the four years  preceding  30  April  2000,  the  number  of  awaiting-trial
prisoners held for longer than three months increased from 4 000 to over  27
000. So, almost half of all awaiting-trial  prisoners  have  been  held  for
longer than three months.

Considering the enormous costs involved in  building  new  prisons,  if  the
number of awaiting-trial prisoners could be reduced  to  what  it  was  five
years before - that is  24  000  -  there  would  be  almost  40  000  fewer
prisoners. The aim should be to reduce the number further to almost  20  000
awaiting-trial prisoners. Electronic monitoring  offers  a  system  that  is
cheap, can relieve the problem of overcrowding and  provide  the  department
with  a  system  through  which  it  can  monitor  parolees,  people   under
correctional supervision, and the officials from Correctional Services  that
must monitor these people.

The list of infringements of prisoners' basic rights caused by  overcrowding
is endless. Numerous reports  and  articles  have  drawn  attention  to  the
plight of prisoners. This has to be addressed without delay.

Mr S  N  SWART:  Chairman,  hon  Minister,  the  ACDP  shares  the  concerns
regarding the  Inspecting  Judge's  call  to  grant  a  general  amnesty  to
celebrate ten years of democracy. I find the reasoning as  reported  in  the
media unconvincing, in view of the high crime levels in  South  Africa.  The
question arises as to how many of the 9 000  sentenced  prisoners  who  were
released following the previous general amnesty for a specific  occasion  in
1998 re-offended and are again in prison.

The main cause of overcrowding in prisons, as  many  of  the  speakers  have
pointed out, is the high number of awaiting-trial prisoners  resulting  from
backlogs in the criminal justice system and this should be addressed  rather
than offering a general amnesty for certain  prisoners.  In  this  regard  I
wish to commend officials in Correctional Services and  other  officials  in
the criminal justice cluster in reducing this number  by  applying  sections
62(f) and 63(a). Much still has to  be  done  as  we  know  that  there  are
approximately 19 000 awaiting-trial prisoners who  cannot  afford  bail  and
who are not considered a danger to society. The social cost  of  locking  up
these persons, who are in law presumed to be innocent until  proven  guilty,
in these universities of crime, is inestimable. I differ with Justice  Fagan
on one aspect and I wish to quote him in this regard, where he says:


  ... such prisoners sit idly without receiving  instruction  or  attending
  courses, wasting their lives and, besides,  losing  their  employment  or
  schooling, the cost to the state is enormous.

The ACDP also wishes to commend the Minister  and  the  department  for  the
emphasis on restorative justice programmes which  I  have  promoted  over  a
number of years from this platform. We see this as being premised  upon  the
acceptance of guilt by the offender and the payment of  restitution  to  the
victim, where appropriate, or the rendering of community  service  in  cases
where there is no danger to the public. We  also,  as  christian  democrats,
would like to commend the Minister  and  the  department  for  their  active
promotion of the Alpha prison religious  programme.  We  fully  endorse  the
Minister's sentiments as expressed recently. I would like to quote him:


  ... that the church has a calling to visit and care for  those  who  have
  gone astray to minister to them in prison and to help them on  their  new
  path of repentance and reconciliation upon release.

Faith-based rehabilitation programmes have been found,  internationally,  to
significantly reduce the rates of reoffending and must be  encouraged.  This
approach stands in stark contrast to that of the Minister of  Education  who
seeks to remove all religious observances during school hours.

Whilst we appreciate the Minister's comments earlier this  morning,  we,  as
the  ACDP,  continue  to  call  for  compulsory  HIV  testing  of  sentenced
prisoners in particular. One  of  the  speakers  referred  earlier  to  this
horrific, "slow puncture"  death  sentence.  We  call  for  HIV/Aids  to  be
declared a notifiable and  communicable  disease,  following  which  section
6(5) of the Correctional Services Act will apply.

In conclusion, as  the  ACDP,  we  would  wish  to  thank  and  commend  the
commissioner, his senior officials and all the ranking  officials  here  for
their dedicated service under very  difficult  conditions  of  overcrowding.
[Applause.]

[Bishop L J TOLO: Hon Chairperson, hon Minister  of  Correctional  Services,
hon chairperson of the portfolio committee Comrade Mashimbye,  hon  members,
the ANC supports the Vote of the Department of Correctional Services.

My speech will focus on the thorny issue of female and  juvenile  prisoners.
But, before I proceed, I should like to remind hon members  that  since  its
inception in 1912, the ANC has been a tireless champion of freedom  and  the
pursuit of happiness among all the people of South Africa.

In the days when hon members and I were growing  up,  the  incarceration  of
children was a rare occurrence. Yet,  nowadays,  children  as  young  as  13
years of age are incarcerated. Let us find the root cause of this. I  assume
that all of us in this House were raised  by  parents  who  worked  together
very closely in providing an appropriate environment for our guidance.  Each
child knew that a parent was not just one's  biological  father  or  mother,
but that any man or woman in the community could play a guardian's  role  in
a child's development and was therefore one's parent too.  That  is  why  it
was rare to have a child in detention in those days.

However, as I said earlier, today a growing number of children  are  serving
prison sentences. I therefore appeal to parents, all over South  Africa,  to
work together in finding common ground for ensuring that  our  children  are
not jailbirds. In this regard, we should seriously raise this concern:  What
will the future of a generation, one half of whose  children  suffer  inside
prisons whilst the other half live peacefully outside prisons, turn  out  to
be like?

We know very well that all of us were kept apart by apartheid policies.  How
the policies of separation managed  to  keep  us  separated  remains  a  big
question. If our children are in two groups,  one  inside  prisons  and  the
other outside prisons, by the time they are our age, they will logically  be
in two groups that are pitted against each other. Therefore, as parents,  we
need to work for unity and co-operation among South Africans so that we  can
address this problem.

Some children are in detention because of serious  crimes  such  as  killing
people with firearms. If one takes a closer look at  what  actually  happens
in some of these cases, one may  rightly  conclude  that  our  children  are
being  led  astray  by  some  adults.  Some   adults,   faceless   criminals
themselves, may  want  to  turn  children  into  thieves  and  murderers  by
supplying them with weapons. For instance, a parent who has  a  firearm  may
fail to hide it away from his children, and a child may gain access to  that
weapon and use it inappropriately and end up in prison.

Another reason for juvenile incarceration may stem from  instances  where  a
heartless husband, having  fathered  close  to  ten  children,  deserts  his
family and disavows himself of any responsibility. The  poor  woman,  now  a
single parent, is left with the responsibility of shouldering the burden  of
raising children aged from one month to ten years in  absolute  destitution.
She has no time to fend for herself and her family. As a  result  of  hunger
and poverty, those children easily fall prey to temptations  and  engage  in
crimes such as shoplifting and burglary, and end up  in  prison.  Therefore,
as parents, we need to find ways of saving our children from incarceration.

It is quite tough with our womenfolk. The female prison population in  South
Africa constitutes about 4 000, which shows  that  women  behave  relatively
well.  In  sharp  contrast,  the  male  prison  population   constitutes   a
staggering 120 000, if I am not mistaken. Most women are incarcerated  as  a
result of offences ranging from stealing bread to murdering their spouses.

Murder is unacceptable. Our Government does not,  by  any  means,  encourage
people to commit murder. But, some of  the  things  that  compel  people  to
resort to this kind of crime may arise from  family  conflicts  and  abusive
relationships. Fellow South African husbands, let us treat  our  wives  with
love and affection, just like the days when our romances first blossomed  as
young lovers. [Applause.] I believe that if we did that, there would  be  no
marriages on the rocks or unhappy  relationships  within  families.  Let  us
stand up and feed the flames of love within our families. Each morning  when
you wake up, kiss your wife passionately  and  repeat  the  act  each  night
before you go to sleep. [Applause.]

With that practice in place, I assure you, there should be no  woman  ending
up in prison. The small proportion  of  4  000  female  prisoners  in  South
Africa, within a population of 43 million, is testimony  to  the  fact  that
women are trying their best to behave. I believe that  if  we  treated  them
with love and happiness, none of them would end up in jail.

My proposal to you, the Minister and  our  Government,  is  that  we  should
consider erecting some special facilities in the form of  special  rooms  in
female prisons, where incarcerated mothers can spend some  time,  say  about
two to three weeks, in the company of their babies so  that  they  can  have
enough maternal care. Children should  not  be  told  about  their  mothers'
incarceration,  because  if  they  are  told,  they  will  experience   some
devastating traumas.

Hon Minister Skosana is indeed faced with an insurmountable task. Among  the
incarcerated  juveniles  are  street  children.  They  have  parents.  Their
parents need to care for them. There are many street children in prison.  We
should ask ourselves what we should do about this situation. Of  course,  we
should refrain from deceiving ourselves into thinking that our children  are
not problematic; that they are attending school in a normal way;  that  they
are not that naughty and that they are well behaved.

At the start of my speech I raised a question as to  how  the  children  who
are suffering inside prisons would relate in the future  to  those  who  are
living happily outside prisons.  As  the  number  of  incarcerated  children
increases, the potential number  of  future  criminals  will  also  increase
until it is 50/50 in respect of those who are delinquents and those who  are
law-abiding.

May I remind Christians about the gospel contained in Matthew  25:36:  ``...
I was in prison and you came to visit  me''.  I  therefore  want  to  remind
Christians of all denominations in our country that we should  make  it  our
duty  to  visit  prisons  so  that  we  can   assist   our   Government   in
rehabilitating those who have gone astray, back into our  fold.  [Applause.]
Equally, the message contained in Mark 10:1-14 is that he who does not  care
for a child is guilty before God, and that he who does not love his wife  is
guilty before the Lord.

I therefore appeal to parents  to  stand  up,  and  not  only  to  look  for
guidance from correctional services officials who are here  with  us  today,
but, on our own, to participate in building a future nation that, even  long
after our generation has passed, can live  harmoniously  and  peacefully.  I
thank you. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Miss S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, the democracy of South African society has  so
much  respect  for  human  life  that  perpetrators  of  injustices  receive
protection and recognition by our supreme law,  our  national  Constitution.
This places an obligation on the department to ensure the  safe  custody  of
prisoners until they are legally released.

The country has 241 prisons, many  of  which  are  bursting  at  the  seams.
Overcrowded jails are a reflection of our crime-infested  country  but  they
are also a reflection of the strong arm of the law that brings  perpetrators
to book.
Our system of correctional services accommodates criminals.  Many  civilians
may feel that Government's punishment is weak and rather to the  benefit  of
criminals who, in prison, enjoy the luxury of a  bed,  sanitary  conditions,
food and other basic means of survival that many of  our  impoverished  law-
abiding people do not have. However, the aim of  imprisonment  is  manifold:
Firstly, the aim of imprisonment is to punish and replace the  balance  that
has been disrupted in society. Secondly, there is the factor of  reformation
to which a criminal should have the right. Thirdly, there is the  factor  of
prevention. Prevention is in two parts, namely to  prevent  the  perpetrator
from committing crime  again  and,  also  to  prevent  anyone  else  in  the
community from committing the same or a similar crime.  Fourthly,  there  is
the factor of retribution.

The MF is pleased to note that the department, in all  its  programmes,  has
inculcated the above. Juvenile delinquency is common  in  South  Africa  and
the MF shares the  concern  for  the  reformation  of  the  youth  in  these
circumstances. The MF feels that the system of  privileges  adopted  by  the
department would serve as a perfect incentive to persuade  prisoners  to  be
amenable  to  reformation.  The  MF  supports  Vote  21.   [Time   expired.]
[Applause.]

Mr M M Z DYANI: Chairperson and the august House, I  am  delighted  to  take
part in this important debate.  The  debate  relates  to  a  very  difficult
problem,  the  problem  of  promoting  and  maintaining  the  cause   of   a
justiciable society in our land. Speaking from  the  vantage  point  of  the
correctional  wing  of  our  justice  system,  I  will  speak  on  the  core
occupation of the  correctional  system  which  is  rehabilitation  and  the
problems related thereto.

In discussing rehabilitation in our correctional system,  I  would  like  to
contextualise my discussion  by  making  use  of  history.  Since  depriving
people of their liberty through incarceration is  a  foreign  phenomenon  in
our land, I will rely  more  on  Europe  and  America  for  the  history  of
imprisonment. In Europe  before  the  18th  century,  as  the  Minister  has
indicated, the idea of imprisonment as the sole  punishment  only  was  non-
existent. Criminals were imprisoned so that another punitive  process  could
be carried out. The person was  imprisoned  so  that  he  or  she  could  be
hanged, whipped or exiled.

The idea of the denial of liberty and physical  confinement  as  a  form  of
punishment only took root  in  18th  century  Europe.  It  was  during  that
century that houses of correction were built. Criminals were sent  to  those
houses for lengthy periods as a means of punishment. In  those  correctional
houses inmates were housed without  any  regard  to  sex,  age  or  type  of
offence. The idea behind imprisonment in Europe was  the  need  to  lock  up
paupers and debtors for the purpose of extracting  money  from  them,  hence
the first prisons were called debtor's correctional facilities.

I hasten to point out that even in this 21st century  of  massive  opulence,
poor people still constitute the mainstay of prison  populations  throughout
the world. As liberators and agents of consummate freedom, we have  to  deal
with the bold reality that poverty is the major cause  of  lawbreaking.  We,
thus, have to be more desperate in rolling back the  frontiers  of  poverty.
Rolling back the frontiers of poverty is a  long-term  process  and  a  tall
order. I think that the short-term strategy promoting the  goal  of  poverty
alleviation is to desperately fight for adequate and satisfactory  nutrition
for each and every individual citizen of the  country.  It  is  not  poverty
that causes our correctional facilities to be bursting  at  the  seams  with
prisoners. It is not poverty that pushes our people out of the rural  areas,
it is the pangs of hunger in their empty stomachs.

We have to rehabilitate our society  so  that  more  and  more  persons  are
afforded alternatives to committing crimes.  One  of  the  earliest  prisons
Bridewell opened in London in 1557. The first state  reformatory  was  built
in Elmira New York in 1876. However, it was only in 1925 that  reformatories
became real  reformatories  designed  for  rehabilitation.  The  idea  of  a
reformatory started  with  Pope  Clement  XI  in  Rome,  in  1704,  when  he
established  a  house  of  corrections  for  juvenile  offenders  only,  and
separated boys from hardened criminals. In 1771 a house of  corrections  was
built  in  Ghent,  Belgium.  That  house  influenced  the  architecture  and
management  of  prisons  into  the  20th  century.  There,  prisoners   were
classified and separated by sex and offence. They were also  given  training
in useful trades.

In Great Britain, during the late 18th and early 19th century, John  Howard,
Jeremy Bentham and Elizabeth Gurney  Fry  were  leaders  in  prison  reform.
During 18th-century England more than 200 crimes were punishable  by  death.
But,  in  the  19th  century  imprisonment  became  the  customary  form  of
punishment. In 1682, in  Pennsylvania,  William  Penn  abandoned  the  death
penalty for all offences except murder. Imprisonment was adopted as a  chief
punishment for crime. Pennsylvania gave us the  name  penitentiary  when  it
developed the solitary and separate system, where prisoners were  locked  up
alone in individual cells to enable them to meditate and to do penance.

I think it is proper that while discussing rehabilitation  as  a  subject  I
should first of all explain  the  concept  of  rehabilitation.  The  Concise
Oxford  Dictionary  states  that  to   rehabilitate   is   to   restore   to
effectiveness or normal life by training etc, especially after  imprisonment
or illness. The explanation indicates that the goal of the penologist is  to
return the prisoner to society, after his sentence has  been  served,  as  a
full citizen. The work of transforming a lawbreaker to a law-respecting  and
law-abiding citizen is a very, very difficult  exercise.  The  people  doing
the  work  of  rehabilitating  offenders  deserve  the  utmost  respect  and
sympathy from the society they serve.

The work of the courts is relatively  easier  when  we  look  at  the  whole
justice system. The courts only determine  and  pronounce  punishment  after
weighing evidence. The penologists who man  correctional  centres  have  the
onerous task of  executing  the  court's  judgement.  They  have  to  do  so
strictly within the parameters of the letter and spirit  of  the  judgement,
while at the same time they are not expected to be mechanistic or  crude  in
the execution of the judgement. Psychological, class  and  cultural  factors
have to be taken into account  in  dealing  with  inmates  who  have  to  be
treated as the idiosyncratic individuals we all are.

When a person commits an offence he or she is  tampering  with  the  justice
equilibrium, an equilibrium that  guarantees  to  citizens  an  orderly  and
peaceful existence in civilized society. The equilibrium  is  restored  when
society punishes a wrongdoer with a view to  deterring  the  lawbreaker  and
the like-minded  from  breaking  the  law.  One  of  the  greatest  biblical
personalities and a great legal philosopher, St Paul, said there is  no  sin
without law. While this is a truism, it is also self-evident that  civilized
life is not possible without law; especially when class cleavages are  still
at the base of our social existence.

Imprisonment of a person is punishment by itself.  It  is  just  and  proper
that we punish lawbreakers. The  important  thing  is  that  the  punishment
should be just, proper and fitting. I wish to emphasise that the  notion  of
punishment does not negate rehabilitation. On the contrary it is a  part  of
it but not a  primary  element.  A  view  that  propounds  a  rehabilitative
process devoid of any element of punishment, is the  one  I  will  term  the
Shavian criminological option.

George Bernard Shaw, an Irish social  critic  and  dramatist  believed  that
punishing people by imprisonment was  backward  and  that  lawbreakers  only
needed clinics where they would be counselled. Bernard Shaw was  an  ironist
but a totally  serious  ironist  about  his  statements.  The  goal  of  the
rehabilitating process is to make a  person  respond  appropriately  to  the
realities of his or her environment. A human being cannot  be  changed  when
his or her  environment  is  not  conducive  to  rehabilitation.  There  is,
therefore, a need to make the environment conducive  to  rehabilitation,  if
we are to meaningfully engage in the task of rehabilitating  offenders.  One
of the most important  conditions  of  aiding  rehabilitation  is  the  good
quality of officers in correctional centres. Good quality officers  make  it
difficult for both rogue officers and wayward inmates to establish an  ethos
of vice in a correctional facility.

Officers  who  deal  with  rehabilitation  as  an  aspect  of   correctional
activities should be trained to have a basic  understanding  of  criminology
and human behaviour. The total  lack  of  such  knowledge  causes  the  good
efforts aimed  at  rehabilitation  to  be  futile.  Overcrowding  undermines
rehabilitation efforts in poignant and obvious ways. Overcrowding is one  of
the factors that dehumanises inmates.  South  African  correctional  centres
combined are overburdened with prisoners to the tune  of  77  000.  This  is
clearly debilitating for  both  the  inmate  and  the  corrector.  The  high
numbers need to be reduced to acceptable levels - levels that  would  easily
facilitate rehabilitation.

To be true to our belief in rehabilitation, formal  education  must  be  the
primary instrument of rehabilitation. It definitely has to be at the  centre
of the rehabilitatory system. Prisoners should  be  zealously  persuaded  to
study  for  both  academic  and  vocational  achievement.   Putting   formal
education  and  training  at  the  core  of  rehabilitation  will  be  quite
expensive, but attempting to rehabilitate without paying  for  education  is
an exercise in astute sophistry, at best, and an exercise  in  futility,  at
worst. Realism tells us that that cannot be immediately done, while it  must
be seriously aimed for and programmatically so.

Mnr C AUCAMP: Mnr die Voorsitter, wanneer ons vandag praat, is dit  oor  die
lot deur omstandighede en die vooruitsigte van 187 000 mense. Weet agb  lede
hoeveel is dit? So amper-amper Loftus, Ellis Park, Kings  Park  en  Nuweland
almal saam volgepak. Dis baie, en dit terwyl die  departement  se  personeel
en fasiliteite net gerat is vir 110 000. Artikel 35  van  die  Hoofstuk  oor
Menseregte in ons Grondwet handel oor die regte van hierdie  mense.  Dit  is
op papier, maar wat gebeur in die praktyk? Artikel 35(2)(f) skep die  indruk
dat 'n gevangene die reg het om deur 'n religieuse raadgewer  van  sy  keuse
besoek te word. Ek kan hier vermeld  dat  in  die  geval  van  'n  besondere
gevangene in die Sonderwater-gevangenis die betrokke geestelike verbied  was
om  hierdie  gevangene  te  besoek.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans   paragraph
follows.)

[Mr C AUCAMP: Mr Chairman, when we  speak  today,  it  is  about  the  fate,
through circumstances, and the prospects of 187 000 people. Do  hon  members
know how many people that is? Very nearly Loftus,  Ellis  Park,  Kings  Park
and Newlands all packed to capacity. That is a lot of people, and this  when
the department's staff and facilities are only geared  for  110 000  people.
Section 35 of the Chapter on Human Rights in  our  Constitution  deals  with
the rights of these people. That is on paper, but what happens in  practice?
Section 35(2)(f) creates the impression that a prisoner has the right to  be
visited by a religious adviser of his choice. I can state here that  in  the
case of a specific prisoner in Sonderwater  Prison  the  relevant  spiritual
adviser was prohibited from visiting that prisoner.]

The world is being assured,  under  section  35(2)(e),  that  conditions  in
detention will be humane. However, a case was brought to my attention  where
an offender had to sleep in a toilet because his bed  was  taken  away  from
him when he refused to share fruit from outside with one of the guards.  The
fact is  that  our  prisons  are  hopelessly  overcrowded,  as  stated  this
morning. Conditions in these facilities  are  below  the  minimum  standards
required by the dictates of the Bill  of  Rights.  The  overall  picture  of
conditions in South African prisons is such that the  phrase  ``correctional
services'' becomes a joke.

Is daar sprake van korreksie en rehabilitasie in tronke  wat  gemiddeld  70%
oorbevolk  en  onderbeman  is?  Is  rehabilitasie   moontlik   onder   sulke
omstandighede? Kan die Minister dalk vir ons verwys  na  navorsing  oor  die
kumulatiewe glyskaaleffek van oorbevolking op die dissipline  en  beskerming
van gevangenes teen bendes en medebooswigte? Ek glo  70%  oorbevolking  skep
200%  ekstra  probleme.  Sodoende  word  korrektiewe   dienste   uiteindelik
korruptiewe dienste.

Amper 'n derde van ons bevolking in die tronke is verhoorafwagtend.  Hierdie
syfer is gans te hoog en  is  'n  refleksie  op  die  kriminele  regstelsel,
waarvan die Minister vanmôre nie hier is nie. 'n Geval het onder  my  aandag
gekom van een persoon wat na vier en 'n  half  jaar  van  aanhouding  sonder
verhoor oornag vrygelaat is.  Die  klagte  is  teruggetrek.  Hy  was  in  my
kantoor. In 'n tweede geval was 'n persoon sewe jaar in aanhouding en is  na
bewering  losgelaat  op  voorwaarde  dat  hy  sekere  kriminele  selle   sal
infiltreer.

Die groot probleem lê  ook  by  verhoorafwagtendes.  Ter  voorbereiding  van
hierdie debat het ek met 'n  gevangeniskapelaan  met  20  jaar  ondervinding
gaan gesels. Sy eerste reaksie was dat die situasie  van  verhoorafwagtendes
haglik is. Dit is die tusseninmense, die halfwegstasiemense.  Geen  werklike
rehabilitasieprogramme kan met hulle begin word  nie,  geen  gradering  nie,
geen inprestering in 'n beter kategorie nie, en dit is  mense  wat  nog  nie
eens skuldig  bevind  is  nie.  Die  Nasionale  Aksie  pleit  vir  'n  ander
benadering teenoor verhoorafwagtendes. Om hul  getalle  minder  te  maak  is
justisie  se  werk,  maar  hul  daaglikse  omstandighede   is   in   hierdie
departement se hande.

Daar moet vir hulle dieselfde berading en rehabilitasieprogramme  beskikbaar
wees soos vir reeds  gevonniste  gevangenes.  Veel  groter  onderskeid  moet
gemaak word tussen gewelds- en ander misdadigers. Tot tyd  en  wyl  minstens
'n prima facie-saak teen 'n gearresteerde uitgemaak is, moet hy  of  sy  die
reg hê om alleen aangehou te word. Daar is gevalle waar  na  24  uur  of  'n
hele naweek in arres uitgevind word dat die man totaal  onskuldig  is,  maar
dan is hy klaar gesodomiseer.

Die probleme waarmee hierdie  departement  van  buite  opgesaal  word,  moet
dringend aangespreek word. Korrektiewe Dienste kan dit nie alleen doen  nie.
Wanneer die NA teen hierdie begrotingspos stem, is  dit  nie  'n  mosie  van
wantroue in die Minister of sy departement nie,  maar  'n  protes  teen  die
Aspoestertjie-behandeling waaraan hierdie departement onderworpe is. Op  een
van die plakkate in vandag se  uitstalling  staan,  ``Rehabilitation  -  our
ultimate aim''. Dit is tyd dat dit moet verander na ``Rehabilitation  -  our
ultimate claim''. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Is there any suggestion of correction and rehabilitation in  prisons  which
are on average 70% overcrowded and understaffed? Is rehabilitation  possible
under such circumstances? Can the Minister  perhaps  refer  us  to  research
about the cumulative sliding scale effect of overcrowding on the  discipline
and protection of prisoners against gangs and fellow  criminals?  I  believe
that  70%  overcrowding  creates  200%  additional  problems.   Consequently
correctional services ultimately become corruptive services.

Almost a third of our population in prisons are awaiting trial. This  figure
is far too high and is a reflection on the criminal justice system, and  the
Minister entrusted with that portfolio is not  here  this  morning.  A  case
came to my attention of a person who after  having  been  in  detention  for
four and a half years without trial was suddenly released. The charges  were
withdrawn. He was in my office. In a second case, a person was in  detention
for seven years and was allegedly released on condition that he  infiltrated
certain criminal cells.
The major problem also lies with people awaiting trial. In  preparation  for
this debate I spoke to a prison chaplain  with  20  years'  experience.  His
first reaction was  that  the  situation  of  awaiting-trial  prisoners  was
dreadful. These are the in-between people, the  halfway-station  people.  No
real rehabilitation programmes can be implemented for them, no  grading,  no
improving to get into a better category, and these are people who  have  not
yet even been found guilty.  The  National  Action  calls  for  a  different
approach towards people awaiting trial. To decrease  their  numbers  is  the
work of justice, but their day-to-day conditions are in the  hands  of  this
department.

The same counselling and rehabilitation programmes should  be  available  to
them as  to  those  prisoners  that  have  been  sentenced.  A  much  bigger
distinction must be made between guilty  of  violent  crimes  offenders  and
other criminals. Until such a time as at least a prima facie case  has  been
made against an arrested person, he  or  she  must  have  the  right  to  be
detained separately. There are  cases  where  after  24  hours  or  a  whole
weekend  under  arrest,  it  has  been  found  that  someone  is  completely
innocent, but by then he has already been sodomised.

The problems with which this department is burdened from  the  outside  must
be addressed urgently. Correctional Services cannot do it  alone.  When  the
NA votes against this Vote, it is  not  a  vote  of  no  confidence  in  the
Minister or his department, but a protest against the  Cinderella  treatment
to which this department is subjected. On one of  the  placards  in  today's
exhibition is written: ``Rehabilitation - our ultimate aim''. The  time  has
come for this to be changed to "Rehabilitation - our ultimate claim".

Mnr D V BLOEM: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek weet nie waarom ander  mense  so  suur
is nie. Dit lyk vir my of húlle in die tronk  was,  wat  'n  mens  laat  vra
hoekom hulle daar was, want ons was dan daar. Hulle is suur, hulle  kla  oor
enige ding. Ons weet nie hoekom nie. Hulle prys  nie  die  Minister  oor  sy
goeie werk nie, hulle het net 'n klomp sêgoed. Hulle  is  suur;  diep  suur!
[Tussenwerpsels.]

Ek wil begin deur die Minister, Mnr Skosana, geluk te wens met die  suksesse
wat hy in die departement behaal het sedert sy aanstelling in 1998. Ek  moet
vir hom sê dat hy van die ANC se kant ons volle steun  en  samewerking  het.
Ons waardeer wat hy doen en steun sy departement se begroting. Een  probleem
of nadeel is dat ek sien die Minister het baie gou grys geraak. [Gelag.]

Die Departement van Korrektiewe Dienste is die  afgelope  jaar  gebombardeer
met verskeie voorvalle van korrupsie en wanadministrasie.  Ek  hoef  net  te
verwys na die Grootvlei-video en artikels en nuusberigte oor  drank,  dwelms
en seksuele praktyke in gevangenisse. Daar is ook korrektiewe  beamptes  wat
hulp verleen het by ontvlugting van gevangenes. Hulle was  ook  skuldig  aan
die misbruik van hul mediese fonds.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraphs
follows.)

[Mr D V BLOEM:  Mr  Chairman,  I  do  not  know  why  other  people  are  so
disgruntled. It seems to me as if  they  themselves  have  been  in  prison,
which raises the question why they were there, because we were  there.  They
are disgruntled, they complain about anything. We do not know why. They  are
not commending the Minister for his good work,  they  merely  make  a  great
number   of   wisecracks.   They   are   disgruntled;   very    disgruntled!
[Interjections.]

I want  to  start  by  congratulating  the  Minister,  Mr  Skosana,  on  the
successes he has achieved in the department since his appointment  in  1998.
I have to tell him that he has the full  support  and  co-operation  of  the
ANC. We appreciate what he is doing and  support  his  department's  budget.
One problem or disadvantage is that I see the Minister's hair has gone  gray
very quickly. [Laughter.]

Over the  past  year  the  Department  of  Correctional  Services  has  been
bombarded with various incidents  of  corruption  and  maladministration.  I
need only refer to  the  Grootvlei  video  and  articles  and  news  reports
regarding alcohol, drugs and sexual practices in  prisons.  There  are  also
correctional officers who assisted in the escape  of  prisoners.  They  were
also guilty of misusing their medical aid fund.]

The question we must ask is: Why are we aware  of  these  incidents?  It  is
because of the Minister, who has since 1998 demonstrated that he will  fight
corruption and make it public knowledge. This demonstrates our  Government's
policy of transparency  and  the  eradication  of  corruption  in  order  to
deliver services to our communities. The  Minister  and  the  Department  of
Correctional Services have decided not to hide these matters, but  to  share
them with us and the public.

When he assumed office, Minister Skosana received complaints from  personnel
and  the  public  about  malpractices  in  the   correctional   system.   He
immediately requested the Auditor-General to investigate these  allegations.
This led to a report to the Minister and to  Scopa,  which  resulted,  inter
alia, in the resignation of the then Commissioner of Correctional Services.

Die Minister het egter nie hier opgehou nie. Hy het sy kollega die  Minister
vir die Staatsdiens en Administrasie genader, waarna daar  'n  bestuursoudit
van die departement gedoen is. Tydens  die  oudit  het  nuwe  bewerings  van
korrupsie en wanadministrasie na vore gekom. Beide die Departement  vir  die
Staatsdiens  and  Administrasie  en  die  Staatsdienskommissie  het   hierna
ondersoeke geloods. Die resultate van hierdie ondersoeke  het  die  Minister
laat besluit om die President te  nader  om  'n  geregtelike  kommissie  van
ondersoek aan te stel ten  einde  korrupte  elemente  en  kriminele  in  die
departement 'n finale nekslag toe te dien.  Dit  het  gelei  tot  die  Jali-
kommissie. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[The Minister did not stop there, however. He approached his colleague,  the
Minister  for  the  Public  Service  and  Administration,  after   which   a
management  audit  of  the  department  was  done.  During  the  audit   new
allegations of corruption and maladministration were brought to light.  Both
the Department for the Public Service  and  Administration  and  the  Public
Service Commission launched investigations into this. The results  of  these
investigations prompted the Minister to approach the President to appoint  a
judicial commission of  inquiry  to  deal  a  final  death-blow  to  corrupt
elements and criminals in the department. This led to the Jali Commission.]

The question now is, what have the Minister and his  department  done  about
the recommendations of these investigations and  those  that  were  received
via the interim report of the Jali Commission?  They  did  not  hesitate  to
take action against those people who had transgressed. They  also  rectified
the system and processes that could  have  assisted  such  illegal  actions.
They have now also obtained the assistance of the Scorpions and the  Special
Investigating Unit in cases that need  further  investigation  to  apprehend
the transgressors.

With regard to Durban,  one  senior  manager,  a  director  and  five  other
employees have been subjected to disciplinary hearings. The  senior  manager
has been found guilty on charges  of  fraud  and  corruption  and  has  been
dismissed. Twenty-two employees implicated in the Grootvlei video have  been
subjected to disciplinary measures. To date 14  correctional  officers  have
been dismissed following guilty verdicts in disciplinary  hearings.  Another
correctional  officer  was  dismissed  for  misconduct   before   the   Jali
Commission's recommendations were made known  and  one  correctional  offier
died of natural causes before the disciplinary hearings could commence.  The
remaining cases have already been scheduled.

There is an interim  report  which  deals  specifically  with  qualification
fraud in KwaZulu-Natal, where 28  employees  allegedly  presented  falsified
qualifications to the department, either to obtain employment or  to  effect
promotion. To date nine employees have  been  dismissed,  one  employee  has
resigned and one has absconded. The cases of the 17 remaining employees  are
still subject to investigation and verification.

The disciplinary hearings of a senior manager from  the  Eastern  Cape  will
start soon. I hope that this is the last commission.
As 'n mens kyk na wat ek nou net gesê het, is dit duidelik dat nie die  hele
Departement van Korrektiewe Dienste korrup is nie.  So  word  ons  ingeprent
met die openheid van die Minister en sy  bestuur.  Ek  wil  graag  die  lede
bedank  wat  lojaal  bly  teenoor  hul  departement,  ons  Regering  en  die
gemeenskappe. Daar is net 'n paar vrot appels wat die  departement  se  naam
wil vervuil. Ek doen daarom 'n beroep op  die  personeel  om  saam  met  ons
regering, Minister Skosana, die Parlement  en  die  departement  se  bestuur
hierdie mense aan die kaak te stel.

Ek wil weer eens 'n beroep doen op die Regering om te kyk na  die  salarisse
van hierdie personeel. Hulle werk naamlik dag en nag met hierdie  mense  wat
gerehabiliteer moet word. Dit kom hulle net toe dat ons  toesien  dat  hulle
die regte salarisse kry. Sodoende kan ons  die  korrupsie  ook  van  daardie
kant af uitroei. [Applous.] Dit kom hulle toe dat ons omsien na hulle.

In regter Fagan se verslag is daar dinge wat ander mense nie  goed  verstaan
nie. Ek  het  gehoor  die  agb  Swart  verwys  ook  daarna,  asook  die  een
suurpruim. [Gelag.] Dis nou Mnr Van  Deventer  hier,  wat  sê  mense  moenie
vrygelaat word nie. Dit is nie wat die regter gesê het nie. Hy het gesê  dit
is een voorstel. Hy het 'n voorstel gemaak - dit is nie 'n besluit nie.  Dit
is egter ook nie die eerste keer in die geskiedenis van  hierdie  land  nie.
Toe hierdie agb lid  nog  by  die  Nasionale  Party  was,  het  hulle  mense
vrygelaat. Nou skielik, vandat daar  'n  ANC-regering  is,  het  hulle  suur
druiwe. Dit werk nie so nie. Ons het groot waardering vir  die  regter,  wat
kyk na hierdie dinge. Ons het ook ...

Mnr F J VAN DEVENTER: [Onhoorbaar.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Ekskuus? [Tussenwerpsels.] Jy is suur. Jy het  oorgespring  na
'n ander party en nou het jy 'n groot mond.  [Tussenwerpsels.]  (Translation
of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[When one examines what I have just said, it is clear that  it  is  not  the
entire Department of Correctional Services that is corrupt. In  this  manner
the openness of the Minister and his management is impressed on us. I  would
like to thank those members  who  remain  loyal  to  their  department,  our
Government and the communities. There are only a few rotten apples who  want
to smear the  department's  name.  I  therefore  appeal  to  the  personnel,
together  with  our  Government,  Minister  Skosana,  Parliament   and   the
management of the department, to expose these people.

I once again want to appeal to the Government to look  at  the  salaries  of
these personnel. They are, after all,  working  night  and  day  with  these
people who have to be rehabilitated. Surely it is only fair that we  see  to
it that they get  the  correct  salaries.  In  this  way  we  can  eradicate
corruption from that side too. [Applause.] They deserve to be  looked  after
by us.

In Justice Fagan's report there are things that other people  do  not  fully
grasp. I heard the hon Swart also referring to that, as well  as  one  sour-
face. [Laughter.] That is, of course, Mr Van Deventer over  here,  who  says
people should not be released. That is not what  the  judge  said.  He  said
that was one proposal. He made a proposal - it is not a decision. It is  not
the first time in the history of this country either. When this  hon  member
was still with the National Party,  they  released  people.  Now  all  of  a
sudden, since there is an ANC Government, it is a case of  sour  grapes.  It
does not work like that. We have great admiration for the judge,  who  looks
at these things. We also have ...

Mr F J VAN DEVENTER: [Inaudible.]

Mr D V BLOEM: I beg your pardon? [Interjections.] You are  disgruntled.  You
changed  over  to  another  party  and   now   you   have   a   big   mouth.
[Interjections.]]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, hon member. Please proceed  with  your
speech. [Interjections.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Voorsitter, ek wil vir die Minister  sê  hy  moenie  weggetrek
word van hierdie werk wat hy doen saam  met  die  kommissaris  nie.  Verlede
jaar het ... [Chairperson, I want to say to the Minister that he should  not
be drawn away from this work he is doing  together  with  the  commissioner.
Last year ...]

Mr C M MORKEL: Mr  Chairperson,  is  the  hon  member  prepared  to  take  a
question?

Mr D V BLOEM: Mnr die Voorsitter, wanneer  ek  en  daardie  lid  en  Harksen
bymekaarkom, kan hy maar die vraag vra. [Gelag.]  [Mr  Chairman,  when  that
member, Harksen and I get together, he may ask the question. [Laughter.]]

Mr C M MORKEL: Is that a yes or a no? Are you prepared to take  a  question?
That is not an answer. I would like to know.

Mr D V BLOEM: Nee, ek sal nie.  Ons  moet  eers  drie  wees,  ek  en  jy  en
Harksen. [Gelag.] [No, I will not. There have to be three of us  first,  you
and Harksen and I.]

Mr C M MORKEL: What do you have to hide?

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order, please continue, hon Bloem.

Mnr D V BLOEM: Die kommissaris moet nooit toelaat  dat  negatiewe  mense  sy
gedagtes wegvat van dit wat ons wil doen nie. Ons praat  van  rehabilitasie.
In die verlede het al hierdie mense net  rondgestaan  daar  in  die  tronke.
Hier sit hulle nou, want ons weet wat ons doen. Ons is op die regte pad.  'n
Mens word nie gestraf as hy in die tronk is  nie.  Hy  word  gerehabiliteer.
Ons gaan hom nie met 'n knuppel slaan nie. Die Minister het nou die  dag  'n
snaakse woord gebruik. Ons praat  van  knuppels.  Ons  praat  nie  weer  van
daardie ou naam nie. Daar is nou selfs nie meer  'n  knuppel  in  die  tronk
nie, want ons  praat  met  hierdie  mense.  Ons  sê  vir  hulle  hulle  gaan
vrygelaat word. Hulle sal weer tussen mense wees.

Ek verneem by die Voorsitter dat 'n koor van  gevangenes  vandag  hier  gaan
kom sing. Dit is hoe ons mense rehabiliteer. Ons  maak  nie  van  hulle  nog
erger moordenaars nie. As hulle uitkom is hulle nie nog slegter  verkragters
nie. [Tussenwerpsels.]
Ons waardeer die Minister se werk. Van die  ANC  se  kant  wil  ek  vir  die
kommissaris sê ons waardeer hierdie harde  werk.  Die  departement  se  lede
daarbo moet nie dink al die lede van die Parlement is soos die  DA  se  lede
nie. [Applous.] Die DA het nie visie nie. Ons het 'n visie, ons het  'n  pad
waarop ons beweeg. Ons wil hê dat julle ook soos mense  behandel  word  daar
in die straat. Julle moet ook kan trots wees en sê dat daardie  uniform  ...
[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[The Commissioner should never allow negative people to divert his  thoughts
from what we want to do. We are talking about rehabilitation.  In  the  past
all these people only used to stand around there in the prisons.  Here  they
are sitting now, because we know what we are doing.  We  are  on  the  right
track. A person is not being punished when he is  in  prison.  He  is  being
rehabilitated. We are not going to hit him with a baton. The  Minister  used
a strange word the other day. We talk about batons. We no  longer  use  that
old name. Now there are not even batons in prison any more, because we  talk
to these people. We tell them they are going to be released.  They  will  be
among people again.

I understand from the Chairperson that a choir of prisoners will be  singing
here today. That is how we rehabilitate people. We do not  make  even  worse
murderers of them. When they are released they are not even  worse  rapists.
[Interjections.]

We appreciate the Minister's work. I want to  say  to  the  commissioner  on
behalf of the ANC that  we  appreciate  this  hard  work.  The  department's
members up there should not think that all members of  Parliament  are  like
the members of the DA. [Applause.] The DA does not have vision.  We  have  a
vision, we have a course which we are adopting. We  want  them  also  to  be
treated like human beings there on the street. They must also be  proud  and
say that that uniform ... [Interjections.]]

Mr S B FARROW: [Inaudible.]

Mr D V BLOEM: Nee wat, jy moet daardie ``tie'' gaan  uittrek.  [Gelag.]  Dis
nou 'n skool ``tie'' wat jy daar dra. Jy kom dan hier met 'n skool  ``tie''.
[Applous.] [Tyd verstreke.] [Oh no, you should go and  take  off  that  tie.
[Laughter.] That is a school tie you are wearing. You come  here  wearing  a
school tie. [Applause.] [Time expired.]]

The MINISTER OF CORRECTIONAL  SERVICES:  Chairperson,  I  can  see  that  my
friend over there does not like striped  ties.  I  do  not  know  whether  I
should hide this one or not. [Laughter.] Lest I forget,  the  chairman  also
reminded me that he has lunch for members. All who are here are invited.  He
also said that there will be a choir from prison which will  sing.  I  think
that the function itself will be at the  other  dining  hall.  Everybody  is
invited. I am not the one to detain members. I know that members need  their
lunch and everybody needs their lunch. Others have told me  that  they  want
to go home now.

Firstly, let me say that I appreciate all that has been said  by  all  those
members who responded to this Vote. Starting with the hon  chairperson,  let
me say that I think he has made very good proposals which I  think  we  have
noted, with our officials.  The  proposals  need  to  be  discussed  by  the
cluster, the JCPS or IMSC, including the  cluster  of  directors-general.  I
think that those are very good proposals that were made by our chairperson.

Regarding the hon Van Deventer, let me say that yes,  with  regards  to  the
issue of the Eastern Cape, we are already dealing with that matter  and  the
Commissioner has already sent a task team to that area to  look  into  those
complaints. I think that complaints will be coming as long as we are  trying
to implement this resolution 7. Those are  implications  which  we  need  to
deal with and we are dealing with them.

We have also had some representations from members of Parliament and we  are
dealing with those issues. So, those matters that  members  raised  will  be
dealt with by the task team. But I am also saddened by his  conclusion:  the
inference that he is not supporting this budget because the  Government  did
not give us money. I do not understand the logic that  he  is  punishing  us
for not being given the money. He said: ``It is not the Minister, it is  not
the staff but I am punishing them for not being given the money''.

I appreciate the  brief  history  on  transformation  which  the  hon  Fihla
brought to this House with regard to  human  rights  and  the  treatment  of
offenders. I think that all my colleagues who are here have been  listening,
including our officials and friends, to the way he detailed  that.  I  think
that all of us know that this is what we ought  to  be  doing  as  officials
with regard to  the  treatment  of  prisoners  and  also  the  treatment  of
prisoners by other prisoners.

I see the  point  of  the  hon  Ferreira  as  to  why  we  should  eradicate
corruption and I think we are doing that.  As  to  the  issue  of  releasing
those people without bail, the IMSC  and  JCPS  clusters  are  dealing  with
that. We  are  processing  that  together  with  the  Director  of  National
Prosecutions. On the issue raised by Justice Fagan - I think  Justice  Fagan
was making a proposal to the  President  and  I  think  the  President  will
respond to it, if he feels that it needs responding  to.  But  I  have  said
that the Judge has always assisted us in suggesting various options to  deal
with these matters.

I agree with the hon Ngaleka that  we  have  a  problem  when  it  comes  to
sentences that are handed  down  by  magistrates  because,  sometimes,  when
sentence is handed down by a magistrate in respect of  a  child,  one  finds
that there are no probation officers or social  workers  present,  and  that
nobody could sketch the background of the child. Therefore, a child ends  up
in prison and, as a result, we cannot ourselves say magistrates  should  not
have done that. It is  not  our  prerogative  but  I  think  that  with  the
integration of the criminal justice cluster, we will be able  to  deal  with
these questions eventually because in the beginning we did  not  have  these
things but now we do have them.

I appreciate the hon Durand's sketching the background of  how  we  came  to
deal  with  the  issue  of  corruption.  I  agree  with  him  that  we  need
partnership in order to reduce crime, meaning that we  need  to  be  working
together with communities and civil society to reduce crime.  Otherwise,  we
cannot do it on our own and we need these alternative  incarcerations.  With
regard to  electronic  monitoring  I  think  that  if  the  hon  member  has
proposals from various companies  who  want  to  deal  with  that  matter  -
because I can see that it will not rest - the doors of the commissioner  are
open. I think the member can go to those people  and  discuss  matters  with
them and we will see whether or not it is a viable  proposition.  Otherwise,
it keeps coming up as if somebody is pressurising somebody or something.

Hon Swart, regarding this  general  amnesty,  I  did  say  that  it  is  the
prerogative and powers of the hon the President to look at that.  But,  yes,
I would personally support general amnesty on humanitarian  grounds  because
I know that there are children in there, there are infants in  there,  there
are sick and old people in there. So, I think that even my colleagues  would
support me on that we need to do those things on  humanitarian  grounds.  If
the President can do that, why should we not support it?

To the hon Bishop Tolo, ...

... ke leboha haholo, ntate hobane o botsa ka bana le basadi. O re  na  bana
ba batla eng diteronkong, le hore ekare bana bana ba diteronkong  hobane  ha
ba rutwe letho hae kwana. (Translation of Sotho paragraph follows.)

[... thank you very  much,  sir,  for  your  question  regarding  women  and
children. You are concerned about the presence of children in  prisons,  and
about the fact that it looks like these children are in prison because  they
are not taught anything in their homes.]
The parents are not really educating  or  teaching  their  children  how  to
respect elders, property, and even how to respect women or girl-children.

O a tjho hape, ntate Tolo hore o bona hore ha re ka ba rata  haholo,  basadi
ba rona, ha ba na ho etsa ntho tseo bane ba keneng teronkong ba di  entseng.
Ke dumellana le wena, Bishopo hore ho jwalo. Re tshwanetse hore re ba  rate.
Ha re sa ba rate ba ... [Kena hanong] ...  E,  ke  tjho  jwalo.  [Ditsheho].
(Translation of Sotho paragraph follows.)

[Again, Mr Tolo maintains that if we  can  give  our  wives  the  love  they
deserve, they will never do things similar to those done by  women  who  are
currently held in prisons. I agree with you,  Bishop,  in  this  regard.  We
must love them. If we  do  not,  they  ...  [Interjections.]  Yes,  that  is
exactly what I mean. [Laughter.]]

I agree with the hon Rajbally. I think that  the  question  of  overcrowding
runs through most of the responses here. I agree with her on  the  issue  of
crime prevention, namely that it ought to start with the community,  because
the prison really is the last resort in  dealing  with  these  questions  of
retribution but we can start within the family.

I want to thank the hon Dyani for his brief history on incarceration,  where
it comes from, the meaning  of  rehabilitation  and  why  these  things  are
happening. So I am very grateful for that. That  is  why  I  said  that  our
tertiary institutions ought to be involved in assisting  the  department  in
order to deal with some of the professional aspects of corrections.

I think Mr Aucamp is making a telling statement there  when  he  likens  the
overcrowding to some of the sporting activities  that  we  have,  where  the
stadium is filled with people, either for rugby  or  soccer  and  so  on.  I
always make those analogies myself, that if one sees the whole stadium  full
of people watching Bafana Bafana playing England,  then  one  tells  oneself
that those, in fact, represent half the number of  awaiting-trial  prisoners
and one gets a shock. Then, one wonders when the courts  are  going  to  get
through those people who are sitting there in the  stadium  when,  in  fact,
the police are also arresting thousands more every weekend.

Lastly, I appreciate everything that the hon Bloem said and I know  that  he
is a friend. [Interjections.] He is not an imbongi. He is a  friend  of  the
department. He is a friend of Government. He is  even  your  friend.  So  we
appreciate what Mr Bloem has said and I think he also helps us a great  deal
in many other respects.

Let me repeat my thanks and appreciation not only to those  who  took  part,
but to all who came to listen to the debates, all officials  who  are  here,
on this side and that side, and also those who  have  come  as  visitors.  I
know that we have those who work with us amongst us there, and I  say:  keep
helping us. Keep co-operating with us because the prison system  is  as  old
as man himself. Some of us will come and go and still leave it as  a  prison
system. It will always be there as long as there are men  and  women.  There
will always be a prison system and there will  always  be  prisoners  there.
Long after these fellows have gone, it will  still  be  there,  as  long  as
humans  exist.  So,  that  is  why  I  also  liked  what  Mr   Bloem   said.
[Interjections.] I  thought  that  he  was  privy  to  something  which  the
President may have said. He spoke as a person who was saying goodbye to  me.
Minister, did you hear  that?  [Interjections.]  I  thought  he  was  saying
``Minister, bye bye. You did a good job'', which is something that is  good.
I also want to say thank you  to  the  Minister  for  sitting  with  us  and
spending this time with us in the House. I know that  he  is  not  well.  We
know very well that he  is  not  well  but  I  appreciate  his  being  here.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The House adjourned at 12:23.
