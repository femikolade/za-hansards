              PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF PROVINCES
                                    ____

The Council met at 14:10.

The Chairperson took the Chair and requested members to observe a moment  of
silence for prayers or meditation.

QUESTIONS AND REPLIES - see that book.

ANNOUNCEMENTS, TABLINGS AND COMMITTEE REPORTS - see col 000.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order! Hon members, we shall  proceed  to  deal
with Questions as per the Order Paper. We are expecting quite  a  number  of
the members of the executive to be present during this Question  time.  This
has been arranged well in time. I'm  not  certain  of  the  reason  for  the
absence of many of the Ministers who will  respond,  but  we  are  going  to
proceed.

                              NOTICES OF MOTION

Ms B N SONO: Madam Chair, I hereby give notice that  I  shall  move  at  the
next sitting of the House:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with great dissatisfaction -


       (a)   the  huge  underspending  on  capital  expenditure  by  various
           provinces to the tune of R2,5 billion for the 2002-03  financial
           year;


       (b)   that  the  shockingly  poor  expenditure  of   the   provincial
           governments, coupled with certain national  departments,  leaves
           much to  be  desired  considering  the  levels  of  poverty  and
           unemployment in the country; and


  (2) commends the budget committee decision to undertake  study  tours  to
       the affected provinces; and


  (3) urges that further measures be employed to seriously address capacity
       problems at the different levels of government.

             ACHIEVEMENTS OF FEMALE AIR FORCE CANDIDATE OFFICER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr E A CONROY: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) met trots kennis neem van die prestasie van me Heybrech van  Niekerk,
       'n 21-jarige lugmagstudent, wat as kandidaat-offisier  die  beste  in
       haar klas presteer het om sodoende die eerste ontvanger van die Suid-
       Afrikaanse Lugmag se gesogte  silwer  Wilkinson  lugeskaderswaard  te
       word   en   ook   twee   ander   lugmagtoekennings,    naamlik    die
       offisierskaptrofee en die leierskaptrofee  te  ontvang  en  so,  weer
       eens, bewys het dat die  skone  geslag  geen  duim  vir  hul  manlike
       eweknieë hoef terug te staan nie; en


  (2) haar alle sukses en nuwe hoogtes in haar militêre  vlieëniersloopbaan
       toewens.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride the achievement of Ms Heybrech van  Niekerk,  a  21-
       year-old air force student who as a candidate officer performed  best
       in her class to become the first recipient of the South  African  Air
       Force's sought-after silver Wilkinson air squadron sword and also  of
       two other air force awards, namely the  officership  trophy  and  the
       leadership trophy and so, once again, proved that the fair  sex  does
       not have to take a back seat to their male counterparts at all; and


  (2) wishes her every success and new heights in her career as a  military
       pilot.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          STRENGTHENING OF THE RAND

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes and appreciates the report in the Cape Times about the decrease
       in basic food prices following the strengthening of the rand;


  (2) further notes the good news about the continued strengthening of  the
       rand to R7,76 relative to the American  dollar  as  reported  in  the
       Financial Indicators report this morning;


  (3) believes that a strong rand will further bring about  positive  spin-
       offs for all South African citizens;


  (4)  acknowledges  the  strengthening  of  the  rand  signals  the  sound
       leadership and effective management by the South African  Government;
       and


  (5) therefore calls upon all  members  of  the  Council  to  support  the
       government in its efforts to alleviate poverty  whilst  at  the  same
       time efficiently managing the South African economy.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

        HUMAN TESTING OF FIRST-EVER AIDS VACCINE FOR C-STRAIN OF HIV
                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Madam Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the Medicines Control Council has approved South Africa's  first
           Aids vaccine trial for human studies;


       (b)  this means that human testing of the  first-ever  Aids  vaccine,
           based  exclusively  on  the  C-strain  of  HIV,   which   occurs
           predominantly in Southern Africa, could start  in  South  Africa
           within the next two months;


       (c)  this is a triumph for the developing  world  as  resources  have
           previously been  concentrated  on  developing  vaccines  against
           European and North American strains; and
  (2) further notes that -


       (a)  there are over 100 volunteers in Soweto waiting  to  participate
           in the initial trials; and


       (b)  Dr Reg Broekman, head of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital  in
           Soweto, who is HIV-negative, has also volunteered to participate
           in the trial.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                 UNPARLIAMENTARY CONDUCT BY DEPUTY MINISTER

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  this House had, until recently, maintained a  sense  of  dignity
           and decorum, which was envied by many in the National Assembly;


       (b)  the  hon  Deputy  Minister  of  Defence,  Ms  Madlala-Routledge,
           maligned my colleagues in the National  Assembly  in  a  fashion
           that was unparliamentary and not in keeping with the decorum  of
           this House; and


       (c)  this is rich coming from the hon Deputy Minister  as  there  are
           several  well-known  imbibers  in  her  party  in  the  National
           Assembly;


  (2) that this House resolves to ask the hon Deputy Minister to  apologise
       to this House and my colleagues in  the  National  Assembly,  failing
       which I give fair warning that we will give as good as we get; and
  (3) finally, that this House notes  that  this  downward  slide  and  its
       inevitable result was started by an ANC Deputy Minister.

[Interjections.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Is there any objection to  that  motion?  There
is an objection. The motion will therefore become a notice of a motion.

               INCREASING RATE OF CAR HIJACKINGS IN CAPE TOWN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr T RALANE: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with concern the recent newspaper reports  that  hijackers  may
       now  be  quitting  the  Gauteng  province  for  Cape  Town,   thereby
       increasing incidents of car hijacking;


  (2)  further  notes  and  supports  plans  by  the  acting  Western  Cape
       Provincial Commissioner to curb these acts of  violent  crimes  which
       recently led to violent deaths of motorists in the province;


  (3) calls upon car owners to be vigilant of these criminals and  exercise
       caution when driving in  hotspots  identified  by  the  Western  Cape
       police; and


  (4) calls upon communities in the Western Cape to support the  police  in
       their efforts of rooting out criminals in the province.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                          CHILD MOLESTER IMPRISONED

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move without notice:
  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Mr James McNeil has  finally  been  put  behind  bars  for
       abusing and molesting children whilst he was Father Christmas;


  (2) further notes that some of his victims have since not recovered  from
       this ordeal;


  (3) believes that such acts of child abuse cannot  be  tolerated  in  our
       democratic South Africa;


  (4) further believes that anyone, whatever age, who abuses children  does
       not deserve to live amongst the communities; and


  (5)  therefore  commends  the  police  and  the  prosecution   team   for
       successfully putting Mr McNeil where he belongs, behind bars.

Mr A E VAN NIEKERK:  Chairperson,  I  just  want  to  propose  an  amendment
please, in that this person who was referred to acted as  Father  Christmas,
because we haven't got  the  facts  as  to  whether  he  really  was  Father
Christmas. [Laughter.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF  THE  NCOP:  The  amendment  ``whilst  acting  as  Father
Christmas'' is proposed, and not ``whilst  he  was  Father  Christmas''.  Is
there any objection to that amendment being put?

Amendment agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Motion, as  amended,  agreed  to  in  accordance  with  section  65  of  the
Constitution, namely:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that Mr James McNeil has  finally  been  put  behind  bars  for
       abusing and molesting children whilst acting as Father Christmas;


  (2) further notes that some of his victims have since not recovered  from
       this ordeal;


  (3) believes that such acts of child abuse cannot  be  tolerated  in  our
       democratic South Africa;


  (4) further believes that anyone, whatever age, who abuses children  does
       not deserve to live amongst the communities; and


  (5)  therefore  commends  the  police  and  the  prosecution   team   for
       successfully putting Mr McNeil where he belongs, behind bars.

   ZIMBABWEAN POLICE COMMENDED FOR APPREHENDING CRIMINALS INVOLVED IN THE
                          MURDER OF A SOUTH AFRICAN

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) commends the Zimbabwean  police  for  successfully  apprehending  the
       criminals involved in the murder of Mr Conan Thomas, a South  African
       tourist in Zimbabwe;
  (2) further notes that these criminals were arrested within a short space
       of time after committing this heinous act of violence and crime;


  (3) believes that this is not an isolated incident of crime as  it  could
       happen anywhere in the world;


  (4) further believes that these incidents have a potential of  tarnishing
       the image of our country; and


  (5) calls upon all South  Africans  to  identify  criminals  involved  in
       similar acts and report them to the relevant authorities.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

             INSTITUTE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION OPENED IN KIMBERLEY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr A E VAN NIEKERK: Voorsitter, ek stel sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) die Minister van Onderwys en die Noord-Kaap gelukwens met die opening
       van die Instituut vir Hoër Onderwys in Kimberley;


  (2) van mening is dat dit duidelik is dat die instansie in die  behoeftes
       van die Noord-Kaapenaars moet  voorsien  en  dat  daar  dan  met  reg
       aanspraak gemaak word op Afrikaans as ankertaal van onderrig,  sonder
       dat  enige  van  die  provinsie  se  ander   amptelike   taalsprekers
       uitgesluit sal word.
(Translation of Afrikaans draft resolution follows.)

[Mr A E VAN NIEKERK: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) congratulates the Minister of Education and the  Northern  Cape  with
       the opening of the Institute for Higher Education in Kimberley; and


  (2) is of the opinion that it is clear that the institution must  provide
       for the needs of the people in the Northern Cape and  that  Afrikaans
       is rightly claimed  as  being  the  pivotal  language  of  education,
       without any of the province's other offical language  speakers  being
       excluded.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP: Order!  There  being  no  further  motions  and
before proceeding to the First Order, I return to the  questions  held  over
from Question time. We return to Question 8, held over from  3  June,  asked
of the Minister of Social Development. I note now that Minister Skweyiya  is
here.

                       INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL REVIEW

                                  (Debate)

Ms Q D MAHLANGU: Chairperson, hon members, special  delegates  present  here
and the Deputy Minister of Finance, on behalf of  the  Select  Committee  on
Finance  I  would   like   to   thank   the   Minister   for   tabling   the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review early, so as to allow  us  as  policy-makers
to be able to do our oversight work.

Over the years the IGFR has been and continues to be a  useful  tool,  which
gives the provincial spending trends over  the  years  and  also  highlights
difficulties in some areas of service delivery. Amongst  other  things,  the
IGFR allows us, firstly, to make comparisons between provinces in  terms  of
per capita spending as to how much each  provincial  government  spends  per
person, per citizen, as opposed to the others, and  the  IGFR  tries  to  do
exactly that in making those kinds of comparisons.  Secondly,  it  tries  to
give comparisons between municipalities,  and  further  highlights  problems
and challenges faced by both the provincial and local government spheres.

For the first time the IGFR has been able  to  provide  information  on  the
following areas.  One,  the  IGFR  provides  very  detailed  information  on
personnel issues. This gives the total number of personnel employed  in  the
public sector of the three spheres of government. Two, the IGFR is  able  to
give information on water and sanitation. Three,  it  gives  information  on
road and transport infrastructure in our country. Four, the IGFR is able  to
give information on electricity provision and therefore to the  citizens  at
large. And, five, it deals with land and agriculture - the extent  to  which
our policy intervention in terms of land restitution and others has  enabled
our citizens.

I will now focus on the personnel matters, because my colleagues from  other
select committees will deal with some of the other  issues  in  detail.  The
public sector employs about 1,6 million people. Of that amount,  700 000  of
those work  at  provincial  level  in  different  departments,  and  at  the
provincial level in the departments of education and health respectively.

It is  important  for  us  to  note  that  426 913  employees  work  in  the
Department of Education in the form of teachers and principals in the  main.
That on its own takes a big chunk out of the Education budget that  goes  to
provinces. The remainder then is spent on all the other  functions.  Out  of
the 700 000 employees at provincial level, 216 092 of those people work  for
the Department of Health as nurses, midwives, doctors and  so  forth.  These
are the individuals who are at the cutting  edge  of  service  delivery,  by
which we shall be measured in the near future and also by history.

The figures above tell us that we can only  spend  a  tiny  portion  of  the
country's resources in the following areas: on  building  classrooms,  where
there are still backlogs; on providing quality textbooks and other  learner-
support-related  material;  on  making  sure  that  we  have  well-resourced
libraries; and on properly equipped laboratories in order to  produce  young
people who have the skills our country needs. We need to have  resources  in
this Education budget, a big portion of which  is  spent  on  personnel,  in
order to be able to do these things if we are to address the lack of  skills
going forward into the future.

To address the issues I have just referred to means that  we  must  continue
to train teachers from time to time, but also, at the same time, seek  other
innovative ways of spending our resources on materials, other than  spending
our resources on personnel. Therefore the  continual  training  of  teachers
and school managers, in particular, becomes more crucial.

The large concentration of numbers  of  professionals  in  the  urban  areas
continues to be a challenge. This is in the form of dentists in  the  health
sector, and all other specialists that you will find in the  health  sector.
Therefore, personnel spending for the Department of Health  must  be  geared
towards ensuring that rural  areas  across  the  country  are  able  to  get
professionals in the  form  of  specialists,  dentists,  etc,  in  order  to
service the communities which do need these services.

The rural allowance might assist in changing the  ratio  of  the  population
served in the public sector per health worker. If you  look  at  IGFR  table
5.6, it gives a clear comparison of the number of people who are served  ...
[Inaudible] ... by one  doctor  ...  [Inaudible]  ...  few  specialists  who
service ... [Inaudible  ...  and  in  the  urban  areas  we  have  too  many
specialists who service  a  very  tiny  portion  of  people.  Therefore,  in
redressing those kinds of inequalities and  inequities  that  exist  in  our
system we have to try, amongst other things, to  use  instruments  like  the
rural allowance to be able to attract those people to the rural areas  where
we need them.

The relevant committees in Parliament must monitor the situation  from  time
to time so as to ensure that policy  measures  and  interventions  that  are
currently in place are able to respond  to  these  challenges.  Where  these
policy measures are not able to work, we must as policy-makers  be  able  to
make the necessary recommendations.

Personnel issues at local government  level  continue  to  present  us  with
serious challenges, in particular that of  integration  with  the  different
municipalities which were in existence before  the  municipal  elections  in
2000, in which year the new demarcation took  effect.  Those  municipalities
had different structures, which continue to be a challenge  for  them  today
in delivering service. Among the challenges which existed then - before  the
2000 elections - are different salary scales  of  benefits  and  grades  for
different personnel which came about as a result  of  that  era.  There  are
also lucrative employee benefits for these public servants, and also a  lack
of skills and an inability in rural municipalities to  be  able  to  attract
skilled people and professionals to  work  in  those  rural  areas,  and  so
forth.

This problem has been compounded by the fact that  some  municipalities  are
now paying their senior managers, post-2000, at extremely  high  levels  and
this has been done at the  expense  of  service  delivery.  So  you  find  a
municipality which is able to pay a city manager a salary  which  is  higher
than that of the President, but is  unable  to  deliver  basic  services  to
people.

Therefore, in going forward in addressing these issues, we should  be  able,
as policy-makers, to deal with these kinds of  issues  and  make  proposals.
Also, municipalities on their own must put proper mechanisms and systems  in
place to address these kinds of problems. In our view, this  situation  will
be corrected by moving towards having the  single  Public  Service  that  is
being talked about so that we allow easy  movement  of  people  between  the
different spheres  of  government  without  serious  cost  implications  and
broader issues of skills transfer.

On the issues of service delivery, the IGFR  has  reflected  the  extent  to
which some municipalities are  having  problems,  firstly,  with  water  and
electricity losses as a result of leakage and  old  infrastructure.  If  you
look at the IGFR, it will give you details as to how much money -  in  terms
of rands and cents -  and  kilolitres  of  water  Johannesburg  municipality
loses because of not having an adequate and proper infrastructure.

There is also the issue of inappropriate billing systems. Another reason  is
that there are a lot of illegal connections in  some  of  the  areas.  Other
problems  are  as  a  result  of  municipalities  not  submitting  financial
statements on time, and that a sizeable  number  of  municipalities  in  our
country have been given qualified opinions by the Auditor-General.

All these things, I think, clearly talk to the fact that there  are  serious
capacity issues at the municipal level.  The  points  mentioned  above  come
about as a result of an inadequate revenue collection strategy and the  lack
of skilled people working at local government level.

The Local Government: Municipal Finance  Management  Bill  may  be  able  to
address some of the problems, in particular those that relate  to  financial
management issues and Treasury control measures. The skills levels  will  be
addressed by continual capacity-building at this  level.  Also,  the  single
Public  Service  currently  under  discussion  is  likely  to  support  this
objective.

In  addition,  section  154(1)  of  the  Constitution  clearly  states  that
national Government and provincial governments must support  and  strengthen
municipalities in order for them to manage their own  affairs,  to  exercise
their  powers  and  to  perform  their  functions.  I  think  that  national
Government and provincial governments must try to assist  municipalities  in
this regard. We are happy to hear that  the  Department  of  Provincial  and
Local Government is doing  work  in  this  regard  so  that  some  of  these
problems can be addressed.

The recommendations made by the committee after conducting  public  hearings
are as follows. Firstly, the committee recommends that there must be  closer
co-operation between the different role-players, in  particular  around  the
delivery of water and sanitation, in order to ensure that in  the  near  the
future - if possible in the next two to three years' time  -  there  are  no
people in South Africa who do not have access to clean and safe water or  to
proper sanitation and, therefore, flushing toilets. I think we must  try  to
see to  it  that  this  co-operation  assists  us.  Therefore  the  relevant
committees in the NCOP and Parliament in general, and  in  other  provincial
legislatures, must assist us in going forward to do this.

Secondly, a comprehensive study of the implications of the new  distribution
system, especially of the regional electricity  distributors  -  Reds  -  is
required to allow us to be able to see whether restructuring  will  help  us
or municipalities to be able to generate the revenue that there used  to  be
and, if not, what other mechanisms there are of allowing  municipalities  to
be able to gain the revenue that  they  would  ordinarily  be  gaining  from
billing electricity.

Thirdly, the development  of  proper  billing  systems,  including  for  the
administration of water and  sanitation,  is  critical  to  quality  service
delivery at local government level. Instead of  continuing  to  bill  people
inappropriately, we must try to make sure that  municipalities  have  proper
billing systems so that when  people  are  billed  they  do  not  query  the
billing and end up not paying, and continuing the cycle.

The committee also recommends that any consideration given to  the  increase
of water or any other tariffs must take into account not only cost  factors,
but the need  to  support  the  broader  Government  objective  of  persuing
inflation targeting, so that any tariff or  rate  that  is  increased  takes
this into account so that we try to make sure that the  administered  prices
do not lead us to higher  levels  of  inflation,  which  we  are  trying  to
contain.

The committee also welcomes the decision by Cabinet that  there  must  be  a
national structure or agency established that will ensure that  the  payment
of social security grants is improved. At the  same  time,  we  don't  think
that having this body will be a panacea, or will resolve  all  the  problems
in existence. We  think  that  a  change  of  the  mindset  that  exists  at
different levels - that of service providers or  the  different  departments
of social development - needs to be given serious attention, because  having
the agency is not only going to deal with the problems that are there.

The  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  must  not  be  used  as  a  once-off
exercise, but used throughout the year. The budget  committee  is  currently
busy with the quarterly report and the figures that are published  in  terms
of it. Therefore we request members to utilise the Intergovernmental  Fiscal
Review throughout the year when they do their  oversight  work,  because  it
can only assist us to measure where we are, where we  are  going,  and  what
the problems are so that whatever policy interventions are  made  in  future
are informed by the work we are currently doing. The review can then  assist
us as a tool to measure and do our oversight work.

In conclusion, on 25 June 1955, men and women of this  country  adopted  the
Freedom Charter. Amongst other things, the Freedom Charter says  that  there
shall be houses, security and comfort,  wherein  people  shall  be  decently
housed; a preventive health scheme run by  the  state;  and  the  aged,  the
orphans, the disabled and the sick shall be cared for by the state.

In my view, the IGFR in its broader context,  but  also  in  its  detail  in
terms of giving information ... [Inaudible] ... South  Africa,  in  the  old
age pensioners' grant and the child support grant and  so  forth,  tries  to
give those details and live up to the noble goals these people set in  1955.
It is up to us as policy-makers to stand up to  these  challenges  and  make
sure that these things are achieved.

My sincere thanks go to  my  colleagues  in  the  different  committees  who
participated and held public  hearings.  I  think  that  the  work  we  have
started with the IGFR must not stop here, but must continue.

I also thank the committee members of the Select Committee  on  Finance  and
the provinces who conducted hearings. Some of the  contents  of  the  report
are as a result of those provinces which conducted extensive hearings.

My sincere thanks  also  go  to  our  committee  clerk  Henry  Eksteen,  who
continues to work very hard, and to Sue Brown, who assisted us  in  drafting
the report. I thank the Treasury for publishing the IGFR from time to  time,
because I know that the Minister sometimes feels that we are not  using  the
IGFR. However, it is our intention to use the IGFR to  the  letter.  We  can
only  improve  our  capacity,  something  we  intend  doing.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP:  Order!  I  now  call  the  hon  Fubbs,  the
chairperson of the standing committee on finance of Gauteng legislature.

Ms J M L FUBBS  (Gauteng):  Hon  Chairperson  of  the  National  Council  of
Provinces and also the ... I'm just trying to figure  out  where  to  stand.
Oh, now I'm fine.
I think that in Gauteng the IGFR  has  always  been  a  very  rich  resource
document, and particularly this year the  delivery  of  affordable,  quality
services underpins the Government's imperative to push  back  the  frontiers
of poverty. The performance of the three spheres  of  government,  which  is
analysed in the IGFR, we believe in Gauteng is integral to  this  particular
imperative.

The principle of how the equitable share is divided and shared is  enshrined
in the Constitution itself, particularly in  relation  to  the  co-operative
governance between the three spheres of government. Indeed, when we come  to
our recommendations, that will be one of them, because in  Gauteng  we  have
been able to come to grips with allocative  efficiency.  But  we  have  not,
perhaps, at this stage fully  been  able  to  come  to  grips  with  planned
expenditure in all of the areas.

In terms of the provincial trends, we are very much the same  as  the  other
provinces here. There is a conservative approach to  the  estimate  of  this
and perhaps, partly, this is due to the fact that if you  overestimate,  the
view is that perhaps that could be more  problematic  than  underestimating.
Nevertheless, the finance committee did engage with the Gambling Board,  and
in other areas with the department of roads and public  works  to  find  out
why there is this revenue gap.

To this end, we have now begun to address this. That  department,  with  the
department of finance, is busy developing a system to ensure  that  the  gap
in revenue for vehicle licences  is  closed.  Also,  the  Gambling  Board  -
although they did give a very fancy presentation -  did  accept  that  there
was a need to review  the  estimated  revenue,  particularly  in  regard  to
casinos. We are happy to say that horse racing now is finally  attracting  a
little bit more attention again.

In other areas, when one looks at the IGFR, it is quite clear that we  share
a lot of the positions in the urban provinces.  Nearly  80%  -  79,7%  -  of
Gauteng's budget is directed to social services spending: health,  education
and welfare. This compares very well to the national average of 80,8%.

In terms of how we do spend, though, it is quite clear that  Gauteng  is  in
the lead in terms of Capex. I shall speak a little bit about  the  Gautrain,
which has been called the Shilowa Express, Rapid Rail, a number  of  things,
but essentially it is the Gautrain - the Gauteng  train.  We  have,  over  a
period of years, particularly over  the  last  two  years,  been  dedicating
funds to ensure that this project goes ahead.

With an average of 8,3% growth across provinces over the MTEF,  Gauteng  has
a corresponding 6,1% growth.  But  it  becomes  important  that  during  the
microprioritisation stage, every committee in the  province  takes  up  this
book, this resource, the IGFR, and appreciates the lessons that are  learned
from that and the current expenditure in our budget in  order,  perhaps,  to
give some guidance on the budget ahead.

In respect of education, health, social development and housing  we  realise
that the province has a key responsibility for delivery of these  functions.
We noted, with interest again, the comments and the date of the analysis  in
the IGFR in respect of housing. However, we are happy to say  that  now  the
plan presented by the housing department  to  the  committee  does  indicate
that, for the first time, Gauteng housing is factoring in  lead  time.  This
is very important for securing the land especially in relation to  the  EIA,
the environmental impact study, which is designed, we  believe,  to  protect
people,  especially  the  vulnerable  and,  in  so  doing,   contribute   to
sustainable communities.

The other area that Gauteng has looked at - and, once again, the  data  here
indicates that we should be doing so - are contracts. In  health  there  was
serious  overexpenditure  in  the  early  years.  This  has  certainly  been
curtailed. What we have realised  is  that  unless  contracts  are  robustly
drawn up and legal expertise is engaged, that this can continue to  lead  to
overexpenditure.  So  the  establishment  of  the  Gauteng  Shares  Services
Centre, which will provide professional advice on contracts, is expected  to
improve this area significantly.

Another area is in respect of health professionals. This  was  another  area
in which we were not only losing expertise, but an area which may also  have
led to an element of increased expenditure. We  have  now  put  in  place  a
system not only to recruit, but to retain  such  health  professionals  with
scarce skills.

Personnel numbers in Gauteng have grown by 1,2%  since  1999.  The  national
average growth is -0,7%. The  challenges  facing  personnel  are  noted  and
referred to in the IGFR, which include a need for  appropriate  performance-
related pay systems and a need to  decentralise  personnel  management,  and
have already  begun  to  be  addressed  in  Gauteng.  This  includes  giving
hospital managers real powers.

The other area Gauteng is also concerned with, as I said, is related to  the
Gautrain, that is, roads and transport. When you read the data in  the  IGFR
it is quite clear that we need  to  contextualise  it  before  rushing  into
decisions. The importance of contextualising the analysis of information  in
the IGFR is underlined in roads, which indicates that the Northern  Cape  at
20,5% accounts for the largest provincial network. Gauteng  is  standing  at
2,2% as the lowest. But, again, Gauteng at 45,5%, as the most urbanised  and
industrialised province, has the  highest  percentage  of  paved  or  tarred
roads. The Eastern Cape has the highest percentage of gravel roads.

The need  for  significantly  higher  expenditure  on  road  maintenance  in
Gauteng is clearly evident from the number of vehicles  per  kilometre.  The
IGFR talks about less than 20 vehicles per kilometre for  six  of  the  nine
provinces, whereas in Gauteng the figure is 341.  This  data  underpins  the
differences in Gauteng's road usage and the attendant  challenges.  Clearly,
the decision to construct a rapid-rail link will take  account  of  some  of
the nature of these challenges.

Capital expenditure grows very  strongly  in  Gauteng  over  the  MTEF  and,
indeed, is up by 26% this year. Gautrain is budgeted to  spend  R659 million
this year, and, certainly, it is 44,8% of the Blue IQ which is  standing  at
R1,5 billion.

However, we haven't forgotten about  water  and  sanitation.  In  fact,  the
chairperson of the Select Committee on Finance here at the  NCOP  -  who  is
also, of  course,  a  permanent  delegate  from  Gauteng,  the  hon  Dorothy
Mahlangu - I'm sure was aware from her own visit to  Gauteng  that  this  is
being taken seriously. Our own understanding of the situation is that it  is
related not only to the maintenance of  the  very  old  bulk  infrastructure
there, but also to the billing system itself.

I don't want to run out of time before  I  mention  the  recommendations  we
came up with in our own House. We said that there was indeed a need for  the
development of billing systems - this is in relation to  water  -  including
administration  around  water  and  sanitation.  We  believe  this   remains
critical  to  quality  service   delivery   that   will   ensure   increased
accessibility, equity, effectiveness and efficiency factors.
However, we also recognise the pressure to increase water tariffs,  but  the
province would  certainly  not  support  any  initiative  to  undermine  the
inflation targets set by Government. Thus,  water  tariff  increases  should
not significantly exceed inflation. In short, there is  a  need  to  balance
our decisions - as we always do in an ANC Government - to  take  account  of
all factors within the macroeconomic framework.

There is also a real need for a comprehensive study on  the  implication  of
Reds. We also believe that there is a need to focus on  integrated  delivery
of housing with all spheres of government, and  that  this  should  expedite
planned quality service delivery. The alignment of local government  budgets
and planning with provincial and national is an  important  factor  in  this
regard.

We also believe that comprehensive performance-related  measures  should  be
developed so as to recruit and retain expertise and  skills  in  the  Public
Service generally. Appropriate measures to retain quality educators  in  the
classroom should be considered. This has been done in respect to health,  as
I indicated earlier.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Hon member, your  time
has expired.

Ms  J  M  L  FUBBS  (Gauteng):  I'm  so  glad  I  was  able  to   read   the
recommendations. [Laughter.] Thank you very much. [Applause].

Mr N M RAJU: Hon Deputy Chair, hon  Ministers,  hon  special  delegates  and
colleagues, I would like  to  seize  this  opportunity,  first  of  all,  to
congratulate the hon Minister on his hole in one, which I  read  about  some
time ago. I know that that  is  quite  a  unique  achievement  for  golfers.
Congratulations, sir.

South Africa is a unitary state with a decentralised  system  of  government
of  three  spheres:  national  Government,  nine  provinces  and  284  local
municipalities.  These  three  spheres  of   government   are   distinctive,
interdependent, interrelated and subject to the  principle  of  co-operative
governance.

The central function of the IGFR is to provide consolidated  information  on
the 2003 provincial and the 2002 local government  budgets  and  trends  for
the key purpose of providing information on service delivery,  which  is  so
paramount in Government today.

The Constitution establishes rules for revenue and  expenditure  assignment,
but  with  concurrent  jurisdictional  powers  of  national  and  provincial
governments  in  such  areas  as  education,   health   and   welfare.   The
Constitution further  establishes  some  government  operational  objectives
through the provision of the Bill of Rights. The progressive realisation  of
these ``constitutionally mandated basic  services''  -  the  CMBS  -  is  an
important consideration for the FFC in developing  its  recommendations  for
the equitable division of national revenue.

In the intergovernmental system, the provinces get the biggest share of  the
Budget. The budgeted revenue  of  R280 billion  in  2003-04  is  divided  as
follows: national:  R108,9 billion  -  38,9%;  provinces:  R158,9 billion  -
56,8%; local government: R12 billion  -  4,3%.  Provinces  have  little  own
revenue. They allocate national transfers of some 6,9% plus own  revenue  of
3,1%.

From the 2003 Budget, the largest piece of the cake went to the province  of
KwaZulu-Natal, that is my province, in the amount of  R32 billion,  and  the
smallest piece to the province of the hon Jan  Horne,  namely  the  Northern
Cape, in the amount of R3,9 billion.

The IGFR covers the 2002-03 budgets of municipalities since their  financial
year only begins on 1 July. The local government sphere  comprises  Category
A: Metropolitan authorities, six of which make up 62,7% of local  government
spending;  Category  B:  Local  authorities;  and   Category   C:   District
authorities.

Two thirds of municipal  budgets  are  self-funded  from  user  charges  for
electricity,  water  and  refuse  removal.  Other  sources  of  revenue  are
property taxes, RSC levies and intergovernmental grants.

Conditional grants are the  primary  fiscal  mechanism  in  terms  of  which
national Government can influence the  expenditure  decisions  of  provinces
and municipal governments. Many conditional grants are  designed  to  be  of
limited duration, with the intent of incorporation into the equitable  share
funding mechanism. For example,  the  National  Treasury  makes  conditional
grants towards combating HIV/Aids, which  has  emerged  as  a  major  health
hazard impacting heavily on the poverty of  so  many  of  our  fellow  South
Africans. Government intervention in this aspect underlines the  seriousness
with which HIV-related programmes need to be funded.

Other areas  needing  similar  national  interventions  are  the  plight  of
disabled persons, the revitalisation of  clinics  and  hospitals,  and  such
like. There is no doubt that the equitable formula needs  to  be  constantly
revised.
Education is an important component of the PES formula used by  by  national
Government to determine each province's equitable share allocation.  In  its
submission for the 2003-04 division of revenue,  the  Financial  and  Fiscal
Commission proposed that financing  of  early  childhood  development,  ECD,
should be phased into the educational component of the provincial  equitable
share. Education spending is set to  continue  to  grow  strongly.  The  ECD
programme is an important  reform  initiative  aimed  at  providing  a  more
efficient schooling system.

The national Department of Education envisages that the  introduction  of  a
reception grade will allow for greater school preparation of  learners  and,
ultimately, a lower repeater rate and a  more  efficient  education  system.
Here, we must recognise the  unfortunate  fact  that  passing  matriculation
with exemption is quite an important incentive. So, you will find that  many
of our students repeat their grades, and that is a reality that we  have  to
face.

The share of secondary education spending is set to grow to 43,3%  in  2004-
05, while primary education will  receive  55%  of  school  expenditure.  As
mentioned earlier by the  chairperson  of  the  select  committee,  the  hon
Dorothy Mahlangu, South Africa has 11,9 million learners,  354 000  teachers
and some 27 000 schools. R58 billion is allocated to education in the  2003-
04 national Budget, making it the largest  single  component  of  provincial
budgets, with a share averaging 35,6% of total budget which is  the  highest
in Mpumalanga and in Limpopo at some 40%, and  the  lowest  in  the  Western
Cape at 33%.

Special focus is being placed on  education  management  for  transformation
enhancement, on the retention of teachers, on developing capacity to  manage
capital expenditure and  on  the  development  of  financial  management  in
provincial education.

There  are  other  key  areas,  such  as  the  issuing  of  learner  support
materials, that is, school books, stationery and so on; Abet,  in  terms  of
which it is important that the adult illiteracy  is  addressed,  because  we
cannot allow so many of our adults to still be in the position of not  being
able to read and write. Thank you, Chair. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mrs C NKUNA: Hon Chairperson, let me start  by  congratulating  the  hon  Mr
Raju on having refused this time to articulate controversies in this  House.
[Laughter.]  Hon  Raju,  congratulations;  together  we  are  building  this
country.

Hon Chair, hon Deputy Minister of Finance, hon members,  I  thank  you  all.
Amongst the areas that the IGFR addresses is the  question  of  electricity,
which is part of the public enterprises cluster, hence my  input.  With  due
apology, I was not aware that the hon Minister was in the House as well,  so
I am addressing both of you.

It is without a doubt that electricity plays a  very  fundamental  role  for
individuals in any society and that it has a direct and critical  impact  on
and implications for the lifestyle and wellbeing of  those  individuals  and
their households. It is no secret that we are living in the  modern  era  of
globalisation in  which  things  are  made  possible  by  having  access  to
electricity,  in  which  electricity  is  central  to  the  functioning   of
relatively  everything  in  our  society.  A  nation  with  no   access   to
electricity in this global era will, without a doubt, be faced with  drastic
social and economic challenges.

Electricity is central to everything, from the  proper  functioning  of  our
hospitals and  our  schools,  to  being  a  basic  and  necessary  need  for
individual  households.  Thus,  the  necessity  of  electricity  cannot   be
underestimated or taken for granted.

An amount of R300 million has been allocated to free, basic electricity  for
the poor households in order  for  them  to  have  energy  in  the  form  of
lighting, to be able to iron, etc.

It is true that when we obtained our democracy,  our  Government  was  faced
with a number of  challenges,  in  particular  where  the  distribution  and
accessibility of electricity were concerned. The majority of households  and
vast  areas  in  our  nation,  mostly  those  belonging  to  the  previously
disadvantaged people, did not have access to electricity. For  instance,  it
is not foreign to hear someone tell a story  of  how  difficult  it  was  to
study when he or she was child because he or she had to  use  candles,  and,
for instance, how difficult it was for a mother who had to  breast-feed  her
child. At times, even a candle was not available; you had to try to  open  a
curtain - if there was one - to be able to breast-feed the child.

This is a sad story often narrated  by  thousands  of  people,  because  the
oppressive government made it such that the majority of our people  did  not
have access to electricity. This was not a mistake as they  were  very  much
aware of the implications and the consequences of their actions.

We still have some products of the previous  oppressive  government  in  the
form of human beings, and they are mostly found in the farming  areas.  When
you approach some farms you will find that there are  streetlights,  and  so
you take it for granted that there is a better life for the farmworkers.  In
most cases, or on most farms, especially  where  I  come  from  in  Limpopo,
farmworkers are not allowed to use  electrical  appliances.  However,  I  am
happy to say that with the  Departments  of  Labour  and  of  Land  Affairs,
through ESTA, we are looking into such irregularities.

It is with pride that I mention  that  the  Government,  in  particular  the
relevant enterprise which is Eskom, has done well  thus  far.  Between  1994
and 1999, some 2,8 million South  African  households  received  electricity
for the first time in their homes. Therefore, this means that the people  in
these households are  now  able  to  read  and  study  at  night,  to  watch
television, to access hot water, to get warmth through heaters, to  cook  on
electric stoves and to store their food in their refrigerators.  This  means
that our children will be able to study, and are able to  study  freely  and
comfortably because they have access to electricity.
At this point, it would thus be appropriate for me to read a  quote  that  I
have. This quote brought some pride to me - it signifies how  efficient  and
committed our Government is to the people. The quote reads as follows:


  The electrification programme must rate as one of  the  most  significant
  achievements by this country  and  is  unprecedented  internationally  as
  3,5 million homes have been electrified since 1994.

This translates into over 435 000 homes per annum. That  is  something  that
cannot be scoffed at. It is evidence that the Government of  the  people  is
delivering for a better life for all. Indeed, the demons of  the  past  will
remain a thing of the past and our people will be  empowered.  There  is  no
going back. We are simply moving forward, on board what hon President  Thabo
Mbeki referred to last year in his budget speech  as  a  train  of  progress
that is moving forward; indeed a train of progress the destination of  which
will be the achievement of a better life for all.
The tide has turned. However, we still have those  who  are  moving  against
the direction of the tide. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Nksz P C P MAJODINA: Sekela-Sihlalo  weBhunga  leSizwe  lamaPhondo,  Sihlalo
weBhunga  leSizwe  lamaPhondo   ongaphakathi   apha   eNdlwini,   Mphathiswa
wezeziMali kunye noSekela wakhe, bandibulise kuni nakule  Ndlu  ibekekileyo.
Ukungena kwethu  eburhulumenteni  ngonyaka  ka-1994  kwacaca  mhlophe  ukuba
imigaqo-nkqubo  kunye   nezinto   esazifumana   kurhulumente   wangaphambili
zazingonelanga   ukuncedisa    ekubeni    simelane    nentlaninge    yezinto
ezazingumceli-mngeni esagagana nazo.

Uthutho olusemgangathweni luncedisa ukuphuhlisa uqoqosho. Loo nto  ke  yenza
ukuba  wonke  ubani  afikelele  kwiinkonzo  ezingundoqo.   Xa   uhamba-hamba
kwiilali zoMzantsi Afrika awungedingi sifundiswa  ukuze  sibe  nokukuchazela
ukuba  kuhlala  bani  na  apha  naphaya,  kodwa  ubona   ngemeko   yeendlela
nezithuthi  ezihamba  kuzo.  Kodwa  ukuba   ungumntu   ongazaziyo   iindlela
zasemakhaya nezothutho, uye ufane nenkokeli yombutho  ophikisayo  engafuniyo
ukuba masithethe ngemvelaphi, ukuba sisuka phi na.  Nokuba  sithi  siyatyiwa
sisihlangu,  ithi  qhubani  niye  phambili  kuba  ayifuni   kuzazi   iinyani
zamandulo. Le ke iba yimeko ecace gcaa: Wena  wakhe  wabona  ikat'  emhlophe
ehlungwini.

Ukhuseleko kwizithuthi zikawonke-wonke lukwinqanaba eliphantsi. Kufuneka  ke
zinyuswe  iikawusi  kuba  asizi  kukunyamezela  ukubona   abantu   bakowethu
besweleka begqitywa ziingozi ezindleleni nokhuseleko  olungekhoyo,  ngakumbi
koololiwe.  Makhe  ziyeke  ukukhunyushwa  iindlela,   zibizwe   ngamaganyana
esilungu kuba abavoti bafuna iindlela kuphela. Nokuba indlela ibizwa njengo-
Access, Proclaimed, ngo-N okanye u-R, ayifuni bavote leyo, into  abayifunayo
yindlela elungisiweyo, indlela ehambekayo.

Makungajongwa umhlaba okanye igrabile kuphela,  ngakumba  kumaphondo  ahamba
adibane  nezantyalantyala  zeemvula:  ooMpuma  Koloni,  iPhondo   laseMntla,
ekuthiwa  yiLimpopo  ngoku,  kunye   neKwaZulu-Natal.   Masijonge   iindlela
ezizezinye zokuba ezo ndlela zimelane neemeko zezulu ezintsha ezikhoyo  kuba
kaloku ezi zinto zihamba ziphume nodlolwazana.

Enye into, makuyekwe ukuteketiswa imingxuma esezindleleni. Uthi  uhamba  ub'
uxelelwa  ukuba  kwiikhilomitha  ezinga  uza  kudibana  nemingxuma  emikhulu
kanga.  Le  mali  ebhala  ezi  bhodi  esilumkiso  yimali  emayisetyenziselwe
ukuvala le mingxuma. Mayingathengiswa imingxuma esezindleleni.

Uthi   uMqulu   weNkululeko,   ``Kuya   kuba   kho    izindlu,    ukhuseleko
nobutofotofo.'' Ewe sizakhile  izindlu,  kodwa  asikangeni  ncakasana  phaya
kubutofotofo.  Uye  watsho  uMama  uMahlangu  xa   ebethetha   apha,   wathi
siyasondela ekubeni  athi  umntu  xa  esendlwini  eve  ubutofotofo  elindele
ukutya nobushushu ngaphakathi endlwini.

Amaphondo angayisebenzisi ngokwaneleyo imali kuza kufuneka  ibe  khona  into
eyenziwayo, Mphathiswa wezeziMali. Asina kuyinyamezela  into  yokuba  abantu
banikwe imali ukuze kuphuhliswe uluntu, kodwa  bahlale  bayigcine  ezitasini
loo mali ze kuthi ngomzuzu wokugqibela kuthiwe, ``Yiza, yiza  nantsi  imali.
Yisebenzise uyigqibe kuba uManuel uyasifuna ngoMatshi.''

Eyona nto, xa sithetha ngezothutho,  iibhiliyoni  zine  esizibekele  ecaleni
ngokubhekisele  kumbandela  wokuphuhlisa  ushishino,  ngakumbi   olweeteksi.
Kodwa  ke,  siyavuma  ukuba  ikhona   imingeni   esijongene   nayo   singulo
Rhulumente. Imingeni ke ihamba nathi, nathi ke sikulungele  ukuba  sijongane
nayo.

Mandiyibandakanye ke eyokuba  impumelelo  kwezothutho  imalunga  nokhuseleko
kwezothutho. Ngenxa yomkhomba-ndlela  esithe  sawuqalisa,  kuthe  emva  koko
sabona lisehla inani leengozi ezindleleni.  Kanti  sisendleleni  yokumiselwa
komlawuli wezokhuseleko phaya koololiwe.

Siphumeze  nomthetho  wothutho  lwezendlela  kuzwelonke.  Sithe  sangenelela
ngokuthi   siqinisekise   ukuba   phaya    kushishino    lweeteksi    abukho
ubundlobongela. Yiloo nto namhlanje sikwazi ukuba sihlale phantsi  etafileni
sithethe  nabantu  bolu  shishino.  Kanti  ke  siye   sabonelela   ngothutho
lukawonke-wonke ngoba sisasilela kulo mba.
Kwela Sebe leMisebenzi yoLuntu amaziko ezibonelelo apho  kufika  kume  wonke
umntu  omele  lo  Rhulumente  asebenze,   siwabonile   evelela   eza   ndawo
zasemakhaya.  Sithi  ke:  Huntshu!,  kweli  sebe.  Mababe  ngathi  baqhubela
phambili ukwenza umsebenzi. Akwanelanga apho.

Sinawo  amaziko  emveliso  yoluntu.   Ngokubhekisele   kwiinkqubo   zolutsha
nokusingqongileyo,  sifumana  abantu  abatsha   ingabo   abahamba   phambili
ekwakheni iindawo ezingathi zisetyenziswe ngabantu  abakhubazekileyo.  Kanti
nokulo  mcimbi  kaGawulayo  neNtsholongwane  yaso,  isebe  eli   libambisene
namanye amasebe ukuze alwiswe lo bhubhane.

Ngokubhekisele kubonelelo lwezindlu, sithetha  ngezindlu  ezisemgangathweni.
Kwaye  siyikomiti  ejongene  nezezindlu  siza  kuhamba-hamba  sijonge  ukuba
izindlu ezi kufanele zibe njani  na.  Thixo!,  alabi  lincinci  nje  ixesha.
Ndivaliwe ngoku, Sihlalo? [Uwele-wele.]

Oo! Ukungafumaneki komhlaba khon' ukuze siphuhlise sandise nezindlu  ngowona
mngeni ujongene nathi. Kwaye ke, iiprojekthi zezindlu maziphume  emahlathini
zisondele apho kukho khona  iinkonzo  khon'  ukuze  sikwazi  ukuhlangabezana
nezothutho.

Kanti ke nokuvuselelwa kweendawo zasemakhaya  nezasezidolophini  ikwangomnye
umngeni  ophambili.  Uxanduva  ke  esijongene  nalo  lolokuba  wonke   umntu
waseMzantsi  Afrika  makazive  ekhuselekile,  azive  ephuhliseka.   Abo   ke
bangayithandiyo le  nto  sibaphethe  singuRhulumente  we-ANC.  Nokuba  umntu
uyasivotela okanye akasivoteli na, simphatha  esesesiswini  simse  ekliniki;
simphathe  sibhalise  ukuzalwa  kwakhe;  simphathe  simnike  incwadi-sazisi;

[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa speech follows.)

[Ms P C P MAJODINA: Deputy Chair of the NCOP, Chairperson  of  the  NCOP  in
the House, the Minister of Finance and his deputy, let me greet you in  this
august House. When we entered Government in 1994 it became abundantly  clear
that the policies and the things we got from the  previous  government  were
insufficient to help withstand the numerous challenges that we face.

Quality  transport  helps  the  economy.  It  enables  everyone  to   access
important services. If one walks around in the South  African  villages  one
does not need a learned person to tell you who stays  here  and  there,  but
you can see from the quality of the roads and the vehicles  that  travel  on
them. But if you are someone who does not know the roads in the rural  areas
and the transport, you become like the leader of the opposition  party,  who
does not want us to talk about our origins, where we come from. Even if  one
says the shoe is pinching one's  foot,  he  says  we  must  go  on  forward,
because he doesn't want to know the truths of the past. This is a  situation
that is becoming abundantly clear, like a snow-white cat on a pitch  -  dark
night.

Safety in public transport is at a  low  level.  Socks  must  be  pulled  up
because we are not going to tolerate seeing our people dying as a result  of
road accidents and the absence of safety  measures,  especially  on  trains.
Let there be an end to using English references to  roads,  naming  them  in
English, because voters only want roads. Even if the a  road  is  called  an
access, proclaimed, N or R road, that does not concern the voter. What  they
want is a good road, on which one is capable of travelling.

Ground surface or gravel roads should not be the only thing that  is  looked
at, especially in provinces that have heavy rainfall  such  as  the  Eastern
Cape, the Limpopo province and KwaZulu-Natal. Let us look at other  ways  to
enable those  roads  to  withstand  the  existing  new  weather  conditions,
because these things have repercussions.

Another thing is that using baby terminology when referring to holes in  the
surface of roads should be stopped. One is told: ``Whilst travelling,  after
a certain number of kilometres you'll come across  big  holes.''  The  money
that is used to write these warning signs is what should be used to fill  up
the holes.

The Freedom Charter states  that  ``there  shall  be  houses,  security  and
comfort''. But we have not  entered  the  comfort  zone  completely.  Mother
Mahlangu said here, when she spoke, that we are approaching a  situation  in
which a person, whilst in his house, will be comfortable as  he  is  waiting
for food and will be warm inside the house.

Something will have to be done about  provinces  that  do  not  spend  their
money adequately, Minister of Finance. We  cannot  tolerate  the  fact  that
people are given money to develop society, but they sit and store the  money
in their coffers and, at the last minute, they  say:  ``Come,  come,  here's
money. Use it all because Manuel wants it in March.''

Of most importance, with regard to transport, is that R4  billion  has  been
set  aside  for  the  development  of  the  industry,  especially  the  taxi
industry. However, we  acknowledge,  as  this  Government,  that  there  are
challenges that we face. Challenges are with us and we are prepared to  face
them.

Let me include the fact that the  success  is  about  safety  in  transport.
Because of the  guidelines  that  we  are  implementing,  we  saw  the  road
accident toll dropping. On the other hand, we  are  on  course  towards  the
appointment of a director for safety for rail transport.

We have also passed a law on national roads  transportation.  We  intervened
by ensuring that in the taxi industry there is no violence. That is  why  we
can sit down today around a table and talk to the people of  this  industry.
On the other hand, we have made available public transport  because  we  are
still lagging behind on this matter.

In the public works  department  we  saw  the  multipurpose  centres,  where
everyone representing this Government comes, takes  a  position  and  works,
and visits the rural areas. We say ``well done!'', to this  department.  Let
them proceed with doing the work. It's not enough.
We do have community harvest centres. With regard to  youth  programmes  and
the environment, we find the youth to be the  ones  who  take  the  lead  in
building places that can be utilized by the disabled people.  On  the  other
hand, on the matter pertaining to HIV/Aids the department also  collaborates
with other departments in fighting this scourge.

Concerning the provision of houses, we are  talking  about  quality  houses.
And, as the Portfolio Committee on Housing, we are  going  to  make  rounds,
checking on what the quality of houses ought to be. Lord! It's such a  short
time. I'm now prevented, Chair. [Applause.]

Oh! The unavailability of land to develop and to extend  our  housing  is  a
major challenge facing us. And housing projects must come out of the  bushes
and be closer to where there are services so as to be able  to  reach  those
of transport.

On the other hand, re-engineering of the rural and urban  areas  is  another
major challenge. The responsibility that we have is  that  every  individual
in South Africa must feel safe and that they are being developed.  To  those
who don't like this, we are controlling  them  as  the  ANC-led  Government.
Whether someone votes for us or not, we control him before  birth  and  take
him to the clinic; control  the  registration  of  his  birth;  control  the
issuing of his identity document; control him even  if  he  is  sleeping  at
home, because we are the Government in control. We  received  the  power  to
govern from the voters. They gave us 60%, a percentage which they are  going
to increase in the pending elections. Thank you. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES (Mr M J Mahlangu): Now  your  time  has
expired. [Laughter.]

Dr E A  CONROY:  Hon  Chairperson,  the  Minister  of  Finance,  the  Deputy
Minister of Finance, special delegates and colleagues, this  is  the  fourth
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review to be tabled. The central  function  of  the
IGFR is to provide consolidated information on the 2003 provincial and  2002
local government budgets and trends. In my contribution  to  this  debate  I
will, however, limit my comments to provincial matters.

In addition to provincial budgets and budget trends for the year  2003,  the
IGFR also covers four past and three projected budgets  and  enables  us  to
make comparisons between provinces. The  2003  IGFR  was  published  earlier
than normal in the budget cycle, the main reason being to enable  Parliament
and provincial legislatures to take the  information  into  account  in  the
next few months and to assist in shaping the 2004-05 budget.

Die beginsels waarvolgens die billike aandeel  van  die  nasionale  inkomste
toegedeel en uiteindelik aan dienste  bestee  word,  word  in  die  Grondwet
vervat en die prestasie van die drie vlakke van regering in hierdie  verband
word in die Interregerings-fiskale Oorsig ontleed.

Hierdie vierde uitgawe gee 'n oorsig van  dienslewering,  en  die  besondere
waarde en belang daarvan is dat dit provinsies in staat stel om  provinsiale
vergelykings ten opsigte van die begrotings  van  lynfunksiedepartemente  en
aktiwiteite te tref.

Aangesien provinsiale dienste egter min of geen inkomste genereer nie,  maar
nogtans vir 95% van provinsiale uitgawes verantwoordelik is, moet hulle  uit
die aard van die saak deur middel van nasionale oordragte befonds  word,  en
derhalwe ontvang provinsies die grootste aandeel  van  die  toekennings  uit
die nasionale inkomstebronne, naamlik 56,8%.

Die grootste bron van provinsiale eie inkomste  bly  steeds  padverkeerfooie
wat in 2002-03 38,3% bygedra het  en  waarvan  die  aandeel  in  2003-04  na
verwagting  50,3%  en  tot  50,8%  in   2005-06   sal   wees.   Perderesies,
pasiëntetariewe,  casino's  en  rente  is  ander  provinsiale   bronne   van
inkomste.

Huidige  bestedings-  en  begrotingspatrone  dui   daarop   dat   provinsies
merendeels  konsentreer  op  programme  wat  armes   bevoordeel   deur   die
konsolidering  van  maatskaplike  dienslewering   en   die   verhoging   van
kapitaalbesteding asook die  gehalte  van  besteding.  So  byvoorbeeld  toon
provinsiale  begrotings  gedurende  2003-04  'n  reële  groei  van  7,1%  in
maatskaplikedienstebesteding en 'n reële jaarlikse groei van  5,5%  oor  die
Mediumtermyn-bestedingsraamwerk  vir  2003-04.  (Translation  of   Afrikaans
paragraphs follows.)

[The principles according to which the fair share of  the  national  revenue
is  allocated  and  eventually  spent  on  services  are  contained  in  the
Constitution and the performance of the three levels of government  in  this
regard is analysed in the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review.

This fourth edition provides  an  overview  of  service  delivery,  and  its
particular value and significance is  that  it  enables  provinces  to  draw
provincial  comparisons  with  regard  to  the  budgets   of   line-function
departments and activities.

As provincial services, however,  generate  little  or  no  income  but  are
nevertheless responsible for 95% of provincial expenditure, they  should  as
a matter of fact be funded by means of  national  transfers,  and  therefore
provinces receive  the  largest  share  of  the  allocations  from  national
revenue sources, namely 56,8%.

The greatest source of provincial own revenue  still  remains  road  traffic
fees, which contributed 38,3% in 2002-03, and of which the share in  2003-04
is estimated to be 50,3% and up to 50,8% in 2005-06. Horse  racing,  patient
tariffs, casinos and interest are other provincial sources of revenue.

Current expenditure and budget  patterns  show  that  provinces  are  mostly
concentrating  on  programmes  that  benefit  the   indigent   through   the
consolidation  of  social  service  delivery  and  an  increase  in  capital
expenditure as well  as  in  the  quality  of  expenditure.  Therefore,  for
example, provincial budgets are showing a real increase of  7,1%  in  social
services expenditure and a real annual increase of 5,5% in  the  Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework for 2003-04.]

Despite the trend that spending on  personnel  is  showing  a  decline  from
59,1% of total provincial expenditure in 1999-2000 to 51,6% in 2002-03,  and
is expected to decrease even further to 46,4%  in  2005-06,  expenditure  on
personnel in the social services sector  is  growing  sufficiently  to  meet
delivery challenges over the medium term. The rising share  in  nonpersonnel
spending reflects the efforts of provinces to  improve  the  composition  of
their expenditure and enhances the quality of  services  and  efficiency  of
spending. It would, therefore, seem that there is a  marked  improvement  in
provincial spending patterns.

But the IGFR  nevertheless  identifies  the  need  to  ensure  that  growing
budgets are spent efficiently and effectively and that the quality  services
are delivered, as key challenges facing provinces over the 2003-04 MTEF.

At a meeting of the President's  Co-ordinating  Council  in  March  of  this
year, where the report on the state of provincial finances was presented  by
the Deputy Minister of Finance and where  the  challenges  facing  provinces
were noted, it was, inter alia, resolved that premiers must take  corrective
measures to improve spending capacity and to prevent  fiscal  dumping;  that
challenges with regard to low capital spending be investigated and  private-
sector participation be encouraged; and that  necessary  interventions  need
to be introduced for building  capacity,  developing  skills  and  improving
integrated planning to enhance capital expenditure.

The New NP expresses its appreciation  to  the  National  Treasury  for  the
excellent, transparent and clearly understandable document and supports  the
adoption  of  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance's  report  on   the   2003
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review. Thank you. [Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  Deputy  Minister,  hon
chairperson of  the  Select  Committee  on  Finance  and  hon  members,  the
Department of Agriculture aims to lead and support  sustainable  agriculture
and promote rural development through ensuring access  to  sufficient,  safe
and nutritious food, eliminating skewed participation and  inequity  in  the
sector; maximising growth, employment and income in  agriculture;  enhancing
the sustainable management of natural agricultural resources and  ecological
systems;  ensuring  effective  and  efficient   governance;   and   ensuring
knowledge and information management.

The sharp increase in food prices during 2002 was one of the most  important
issues that faced the country owing to the impact it had on the poor and  on
food security in the Southern African region as a whole.

The Government's response has centred on a package  of  relief  measures  to
supplement the income of the poor, on containing price  pressures  on  basic
foods, and on strengthening the ability of the poor to grow their own  food.
These measures have helped to cushion the impact of inflation on  vulnerable
groups.

Social grants have been increased by an average of 15,2%,  and  the  private
sector has also responded through limited maize subsidies. The  Government's
interventions were effected through the 2002-03 adjustments  estimate  which
set aside R400 million for targeted food  relief  for  the  most  vulnerable
groups. The funds will go mainly towards food  parcel  distribution  on  the
domestic front, that is R230 million, and 100 000 tons of  white  maize  for
affected   Southern   African   Development   Community   countries    worth
R170 million.

The Government is also examining  the  feasibility  of  a  longer-term  food
security  programme  to  provide  households  with  seeds  and   tools   for
subsistence agriculture. In addition, a food  pricing  monitoring  committee
has been established to monitor the prices of a basket of basic  food  items
including maize meal, eggs, bread, milk  and  meat.  I  shouldn't  make  you
hungry, Chairperson. [Laughter.]

The committee will investigate any sharp or unwarranted price increases  and
will do a longer-term analysis of the  link  between  food  prices  and  the
structure of the agricultural supply chain, including looking at the  number
of  producers  and  processors,  the  extent  of  vertical  and   horizontal
integration, and the level of concentration in the food supply chain.

The budget for the implementation of the land reform programme  is  included
in the Vote of the Department of Land Affairs.  Therefore  the  department's
budget for redistribution and restitution  grants  increased  strongly  from
R0,8 billion in 2002-03 to R1,6 billion in 2005-06, or  by  26%  per  annum.
This is more than double the  allocation  between  1999-2000,  when  it  was
R440 million, and 2001-02. It is anticipated that the MTEF will assist  with
the finalisation of legal and administrative processes of the claim.

Water is also critical for the development of the  agricultural  sector  for
commercial, emerging and subsistence farming and other economic  activities.
As a water-poor country with erratic rainfall patterns, South Africa has  to
manage its water resources carefully if it is to meet  social  and  economic
needs.

To  meet  this  challenge,  the  establishment  of  a  coherent  policy  and
regulatory framework appropriate to the physical realities of  South  Africa
is essential. This must go  hand  in  hand  with  establishing  institutions
capable of implementing the policy.

One of Government's key objectives is  the  free  provision  of  up  to  six
kilolitres of water to all households. Municipalities appear  to  be  making
progress in implementing  free  basic  services.  The  Department  of  Water
Affairs and Forestry estimates that  76%  of  municipalities  provided  more
than this.

The free basic policy does not extend to sanitation such as  the  ventilated
improved pit toilet, the VIP, which has minimal operating  costs.  There  is
little information available on how municipalities are providing  sanitation
services to poor  households.  A  sanitation  policy  for  communities  with
access to waterborne sanitation is under development by  the  Department  of
Water Affairs and Forestry.

Chairperson, I want to greet you and thank you heartily. We  are  now  going
into recess. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): I must also thank  you
for working hard whilst you have been here, and go  well  with  the  recess.
[Laughter.]

Mr T B TAABE: Hon Deputy Chairperson, the Minister and  Deputy  Minister  of
Finance respectively, and members  of  the  NCOP,  much  has  been  said  by
members of this House in relation to the debate of  this  afternoon  on  the
Intergovernmental Fiscal Review for 2002-03.

I do not want to repeat the issues which were were so aptly  and  succinctly
raised by the chairperson of our select committee and  also  by  hon  member
Comrade Joanne Fubbs from Gauteng. Therefore I want to deal with the  issues
which have not been raised with regard to this Budget this afternoon.

As you would know, this Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Review  we  are  debating
this  afternoon  covers  the  2003  provincial  budgets  and  discloses  the
detailed plans for all nine provinces. About 61% of  the  nationally  raised
revenue goes to provinces and local  government.  Provincial  budgets  would
then prioritise, as is basically evident in  this  review,  pro-poor  social
services  and  allocate  80,8%  of  total  provincial  spending  to  poverty
alleviation.

It is clear that in this  review  for  2003,  tremendous  improvements  have
indeed been made precisely because,  as  you  would  notice,  provinces  now
spend increasingly more on nonpersonnel expenditure. This  is  confirmed  by
the increased capital expenditure  on  construction  and  rehabilitation  of
public facilities and assets such as school buildings, hospitals and  roads,
and increased spending on housing and on critical items like  textbooks  and
medicine.

Income support continues to be one of our  weapons  as  Government  for  the
offensive against poverty in the  short  term.  Our  Government,  this  very
progressive government led by the glorious army of the African  people,  the
ANC,  has  increased,  as  you  would  know,  the  number  of  social  grant
beneficiaries from 2,5 million in 1997 to 5,6% million in March  2003.  When
we extend the child support grant over the  next  three  years  to  children
until their 14th birthday, the number of beneficiaries will  increase  by  3
million.

The review further shows that the share of social development spending  will
then increase to 26% of provincial spending. It  also  for  the  first  time
provides consolidated information for the first time  on  municipal  budgets
for the period ending June 2003.

I must, however, make special reference to one of the critical issues  which
the FFC raised in its  recommendations,  particularly  relating  to  poverty
targeting. It refers to the cost of poverty targeting in order  to  minimise
errors of inclusion and exclusion,  and  of  inclusion  weighed  up  against
costs of universal coverage of free basic service provision.
A recommendation by the FFC also refers  to  the  impact  of  education  and
health user fees and the impact of tariffs  for  basic  municipal  services,
considered  in  terms  of  the  impact   on   poverty   alleviation.   These
recommendations have considerable merit, because what is the point, the  FFC
argues, of raising user fees when  residents  do  not  have  the  means  and
capacity to pay for basic services?

Members of our committee would be keen indeed to hear what the  views  would
be of National Treasury and those of the Minister  and  Deputy  Minister  in
relation to the issue the FFC is raising on poverty targeting.

With respect to norms and standards, the FFC proposes the  following.  Norms
and standards must take account of resource constraints  and  the  need  for
policy flexibility in the event of emergencies and  new  policy  challenges.
It further proposes that norms and standards should be adjusted to  resource
availability, and must take cognisance  of  environmental  factors  and  new
policy imperatives.
We are aware, as the Select Committee on Finance, of the kinds of  responses
that the National Treasury has provided when responding to the FFC's  costed
norms approach, which responses were provided some  time  ago  in  which  it
argued that the lack of appropriate data imposes  practical  limitations  on
the FFC's approach, and that many of the desired output  measures,  cost  of
inputs, do not currently exist and may be difficult, if not  impossible,  to
obtain.

Moreover,  the  costed  norms  approach  itself  endorses  the  notion  that
provincial education, health and welfare budgets can be  calculated  at  the
national level by formula. The view has come out  very  strongly  that  this
undermines the principle of provincial budgetary  autonomy  and  limits  the
role  of  provincial   executive   committees   in   addressing   provincial
priorities, which then compromises accountability.

There is also  the  difficulty  of  applying  a  costed  norms  approach  to
national departments and local governments. The costed  norms  approach  may
appeal to some aspects of national Budgets, but  for  others,  for  example,
justice,  police  and  defence,  constructing  benchmark  norms   for   such
expenditure may not be possible. These are some  of  the  issues  that  have
come out very sharply.

With  reference  to  provincial  taxes  and  provinces  that  are   pursuing
additional sources of revenue in order to impact on the provincial  economy,
we are aware of only one province, the  Western  Cape,  which  is  currently
engaged in this process. We are aware that a  consortium  to  study  a  fuel
levy has been appointed in line with the requirements of the Provincial  Tax
Regulation Process Act. It would be interesting, and we are keenly  awaiting
the news from other provinces in this regard.

The FFC has made another proposal in relation to funding instruments,  which
could have a positive  effect  on  our  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations
system. These proposals are as follows: firstly, the design  of  conditional
grants  should  be  negotiated  between  the  transferring   and   recipient
authorities; and,  secondly,  the  role  of  conditional  grants  should  be
circumscribed to avoid distortions in the equitable share distribution.

These proposals, we argue, have practical relevance  because  the  proposals
for greater  negotiation  between  transferring  authorities  and  recipient
authorities could facilitate an improvement in  the  spending  capacity  and
ability of provinces. It is therefore not a cliché to say that the  spending
capacity of provinces needs to be dramatically improved.

Further additional recommendations were made, again, by the FFC in  relation
to governance and local government, which issues I had hoped the hon  member
Ralane would deal with,  though  some  were  dealt  with  at  great  length.
However, I will just mention a few ... [Time expired.] [Applause.]

Mr D M KGWARE: Hon Chair, hon Minister, hon Deputy Minister, mine is a  very
short comment. The Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  is  a  major  source  of
assistance to Parliament but, more importantly, to  provincial  legislatures
- I would like to emphasise that point:  to  provincial  legislatures  -  in
assessing, planning and  debating  their  budgets  and  plans  for  critical
services, particularly delivery.

Provincial governments are a distinct sphere  of  government  in  the  sense
that they make rules and orders concerning their business, with  due  regard
to representivity,  participatory  democracy,  accountability,  transparency
and  public  involvement.  Hence,  they  are  allocated  large  grants  from
nationally raised revenue, which  they  determine  how  to  spend.  We,  the
members of this Council, therefore appreciate the  opportunity  afforded  to
us today to scrutinise the performance of our legislatures, particularly  at
a time when we as South Africans are entering our first decade of freedom.

The ANC-led Government  has  made  tremendous  strides  in  dismantling  the
scaffolding of apartheid and Bantu Education, not just in the  quantity  and
quality of education, but also  in  regard  to  alleviating  the  plight  of
especially poor learners from poor communities.  It  is  important  that  we
focus on these notable achievements in order to  gain  some  perspective  on
the significant differences we are making in  the  lives  of  learners  from
very diverse backgrounds.

Since education has the largest average share of the  total  Budget,  namely
35,6%, we are obliged in  terms  of  our  constitutional  responsibility  to
discharge it commensurably. Hence our approach is aligned  with  the  ideals
set out in the seminal document,  the  Freedom  Charter  that  we  might  be
celebrating tomorrow, which states: ``The  doors  of  learning  and  culture
shall be opened ... Education  shall  be  free,  compulsory,  universal  and
equal for all children.''

The fact that we now have 11,9 million learners enrolled in 27 000  schools,
a net enrolment of 95% in  primary  education,  and  364 000  educators,  of
which 86% are provincially based, can be linked to our policy of  compulsory
education which was adopted in 1996. When I say ``our policy  of  compulsory
education'' I am talking about  the  ruling  party  which  is  leading  this
Government.

Yes, our track record will, as we have said in  the  past  and  will  repeat
here today, remain unparalleled. In addition, our  average  expenditure  per
learner has increased from R3 234 in the 1999-2000 Budget  to  an  estimated
R4 437 in the 2002-03 Budget. That  is  an  achievement.  We  are,  however,
concerned that the gap between learners in rich provinces and those in  poor
provinces is still wide. We are, nevertheless, mindful that factors such  as
greater administration expenditure, transport  costs,  high  salaries,  etc,
determine expenditure at the end of the day.

We as the ANC are therefore encouraged by and, in fact, welcome the  efforts
of the Ministry of Education and the national department  to  address  these
inequalities through the Review of the Financing, Resourcing  and  Costs  of
Education in public schools, which has emerged as a result  of  Government's
concern with the high cost of education for all sectors of  our  population,
in particular the poor in the poorest provinces. This mandate emanates  from
our Stellenbosch conference in December 2002, where we resolved  that  money
meant for the poor must reach the poor.

The other measures that  have  been  introduced  that  we  welcome  are  the
inclusive school policy and the implementation of a uniform  budget,  format
and programme structure for education in all  2003  provincial  budgets.  In
terms  of  the  former,  many  learners  with  special  needs  will  now  be
incorporated into ordinary  public  schools.  To  this  end,  the  estimated
expenditure on public  ordinary  schools  for  both  primary  and  secondary
schools of R44,3 billion, or 83,4% of the total Education  budget,  together
with the provided dose of the MTEF, will ensure increased delivery.

With  regard  to  the  uniform  budget  format,  the   reclassification   of
historical expenditure now allows  for  comparison  in  our  historic  first
Government. It is now in a position to present expenditure  on  primary  and
secondary education separately. More importantly, this will greatly  enhance
our capacity to effect equity redress and provide for  timeous  delivery  of
learner support material.

In conclusion, issues that inevitably provoked debate  during  the  analysis
of the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review and which are pertinent to  education
are the  underspending  on  capital  expenditure  and  the  overspending  on
personnel expenditure. Although  we  are  aware  of  significant  Government
spending particularly of capital budgets,  the  modus  operandi  of  certain
provinces leaves a lot to be desired, given  that  some  provinces  fail  to
submit spending plans  with  regard  to  personnel  spending.  If  money  is
allocated to teacher efficiency, it must be utilised for  this  purpose  and
not spent on salaries.  We  believe  that  this  component  requires  closer
analysis and understanding. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr Z S KOLWENI: Hon  Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  Deputy  Minister,  my
colleagues, I indeed had to prune my speech so  as  to  avoid  monotony.  I,
therefore, in my capacity as a permanent delegate in  this  House,  wish  to
align my contribution with trends in provincial budgets in  respect  of  all
eight sectors as reflected throughout by the IGFR document, but shall do  so
in a sifting manner so that I do not contaminate the flavour  of  the  broth
that members should be digesting now.

I need not overemphasise the importance of significant  growth  in  national
transfers with specific details on provincial budgets, sector by sector.  In
our times, challenged by the rampant, pandemic monster of HIV/Aids,  one  is
left with a sense of hope in finding that spending  on  professional  health
personnel, medicine and drugs is growing rapidly, thus  placing  the  health
sector in a position to deliver better health care and ready to  respond  to
the uncalculated and unrealistic pressures associated with this monster.

At some point it is necessary to remind our constituencies  that  the  party
in power now, the ANC, in fact made the health delivery  issue  one  of  its
priorities when developing the 10 commandments in  the  Freedom  Charter  in
1955. Therefore, it means that had the ANC assumed power  during  the  early
sixties, our country's health state of affairs would be on a  par  with  the
health care systems you find in countries  like  the  People's  Republic  of
China.

In fact, that country, having assumed power  in  the  mid-sixties  when  its
health care system was in a shambles, as early as  yesterday  surprised  the
world when it was confronted with the Sars virus. I am  trying  to  indicate
that we are getting to that level of capacity in  terms  of  a  health  care
system ``kancane kancane'' [bit by bit.] For instance, the  building  of  an
additional 10 clinics and the upgrading of 49 clinics are  in  the  pipeline
in my province.

If you can positively take  stock  of  our  country's  firm  and  aggressive
manner in which we responded to the outbreak of the foot-and-mouth  disease,
you will realise how  serious  our  Government  is  about  the  agricultural
sector in our lifetime in South Africa. In the North  West,  agriculture  is
our number two economic basket after the mining sector.
Remember, food security is a major priority for our  Government,  given  the
large numbers  of  our  rural  and  urban  poor  majority.  This  sector  is
supported by state agencies like the Land Bank, the Land  Claims  Commission
and  others.  These  agencies  provide  various   services   to   provincial
departments of agriculture with  a  chain  of  clients,  like  the  National
Farmers'  Union,  emerging  farmers,  poultry  community  projects,   tribal
authorities, subsistence farming projects, etc. I am pleased to inform  this
Council that during the past provincial week, our delegation  engaged  these
state agencies and interfaced them with their client base  and  the  broader
public.

Again, allow me on behalf of our delegation to proudly inform  the  Minister
and the Treasury that these state agencies demonstrated  a  high  degree  of
commitment and diligence in serving their client base and  that  they  value
the resources allocated to them.

Given that my province, the North West, is  one  of  those  provinces  where
agriculture is combined with other functions, such as  conservation  of  the
environment and land affairs, the percentage of total expenditure  has  been
maintained between 2,6% and 2,7% since 1990  in  the  current  2003  Budget,
whereas the allocation for land reform grants  has  increased  significantly
from R0,8 billion to R1,6 billion.

Some other key focus areas include improvement in learner  support  material
expenditure per learner from R170 to R250 per annum.  It  is  also  reported
that an amount of R71 million has been earmarked  to  build  140  additional
classrooms.

Whilst  investment  in  infrastructure  development   such   as   roads   is
indispensable to viable and sustainable economic spending, spending  by  all
spheres of government on roads has exceeded the average for the  past  three
years. The provincial budget for roads  increases  by  9,8%  over  the  MTEF
period.

It is important to note that it was at  the  request  of  the  NCOP  that  a
chapter on agriculture and  land  was  been  included  in  the  review.  The
combined budget for the national and provincial departments  of  agriculture
has been shown to increase by 13,5%.

In conclusion, I may say that life has not only become better, but there  is
also great confidence in the future, because all efforts are geared  towards
pushing back the frontiers of poverty. I thank you. [Applause.]

Mr M OZINSKY (Western Cape): Deputy Chairperson,  hon  Minister  and  Deputy
Minister, hon members, on behalf of the Western Cape I want to welcome  this
review. It gives us an increasing amount of information, which allows us  to
assess what is happening in our province in comparison to  other  provinces.
It allows us, hopefully, to make better decisions  and  to  benchmark  those
decisions against other provinces. It is also a symbol of  increasingly  co-
operative governance in the country.

Mark Twain said: ``Get your facts first and then you  can  distort  them  as
much as you please.'' The opposition is well known for  doing  that,  but  I
think  that  this  really  gives  us  the  facts  to  use  in  that  regard.
[Laughter.]

Our province is one of the most developed provinces.  Historically  we  have
benefited tremendously from  apartheid  and  colonialism  in  terms  of  the
facilities that have been built in our province, but not  in  terms  of  the
actual development of the people. Also, 80% of the population is  urban  and
the province is richly endowed with hospitals, schools, universities and  so
on.

Our province  also  manages  to  provide  basic  services  to  most  of  its
inhabitants, but in many ways this wealth  and  relative  development  masks
the poverty which does exist, both in the  rural  and  urban  areas  of  our
province. In fact, the highest levels of poverty in  the  Western  Cape  are
found in urban areas like Philippi and in the informal settlements of  those
areas.

Our province is able - and the review shows this -  to  obtain  94%  of  its
income from national revenue with the  remaining  6%  coming  from  our  own
revenue. We have been able to grow this own revenue in the  last  period  to
about R1 billion. Most of this income comes from the  road  traffic  licence
fees, which are the highest in the country. There is also  a  proposal  from
the province to look at a provincial tax  on  fuel,  especially  petrol,  to
fund the maintenance of the roads. Even though  we  have  the  highest  road
licence fees in the country, we are still  not  able  to  properly  maintain
roads at present.

The second source of income in our province is  actually  from  interest  on
money that is received by the province. Special measures have been taken  by
the provincial treasury in the last year to ensure good cash management  and
to specifically increase the interest income, which increased by 38% in  the
last year.

The third area of income is patient fees and this has recovered from a  drop
in the period of the late  nineties.  Unfortunately,  the  increase  in  our
patient fee recovery doesn't actually come from better collection, but  from
the partial privatisation of certain wards in certain state hospitals  which
then guarantees an income from patient fees to  the  province,  rather  than
forcing better income generation.

The fourth contributor is gambling taxes. This has  increased  in  the  last
year, because a new casino came on line in the  province.  However,  I  must
say that there is a very heated debate in  the  province  about  whether  we
should be expanding the income from gambling taxes at this time,  especially
with regard to the limited payout machines.

Our province also has the highest cost per person  nationally  of  staff  of
the  provincial  administration  at  about  R105 300  per  employee  of  the
administration. This is something of great concern in the province,  and  it
is hoped that if the MTEF projections are followed in  the  next  few  years
the increase in this cost per staff member will actually  decline  by  about
4,2%.
I wanted to deal with a few departments, starting firstly  with  the  Office
of the Premier in our province. There have been some articles in the  press,
spurred by the DA stating that this office has the  highest  expenditure  of
all premiers' offices in the country. The DA is trying to say that  this  is
as a result of the cost of the co-operation agreement between  the  ANC  and
the NNP. But, in fact, this is not true. The reason why there is  such  high
expenditure in the Premier's Vote in  our  province  is  because  this  Vote
includes programmes in our province  which  are  not  covered  by  premiers'
offices in other provinces.

In particular, IT expenditure in the  province  falls  under  our  premier's
office. The director-general's office falls  directly  under  the  Premier's
Vote as does corporate services.  The  fact  that  these  expenditures  fall
under that Vote is, in fact, a legacy of  DA  rule  in  the  province.  Some
other programmes that did previously fall under the  premier's  office  have
actually been shifted out in the last while of the ANC-NNP co-operation.

In terms of education, our province performs  better  than  other  provinces
because of this historic advantage that we've benefited from. For  instance,
20% of students who write matric in our province receive an endorsement  for
university versus the national average of 17%. However, this actually  masks
quite a number of serious problems in education in  our  province.  Firstly,
only 20% of learners who start in the education system reach matric  in  the
province, and this is obviously worse in the black areas.

In  particular,  we  also  have  serious  problems  with   the   number   of
matriculants who pass with maths and science on  the  higher  grade,  as  do
other provinces. It has been suggested to the  department  that  the  higher
levels that we have of maths and science higher grade passes have a  lot  to
do with the fact that many pupils are encouraged to write these subjects  on
lower grade and that then pushes up the higher grade pass rate.

We also have had a real  reduction  in  the  learner-teacher  ratio  in  the
province. In 2000 the learner-teacher ratio was 31:1 in  the  province  when
nationally it was 38:1. In the past year it was 32:1, which is the  same  as
the national average. We are  looking  forward  to  a  situation  in  which,
together with the rest of the country, the number of  learners  to  teachers
drops significantly.

Our province still has a very high rate of noneducators to educators in  the
education system. Twenty-three percent of the employees  of  the  department
of education are not actually educators. This points to a very large  number
of head office staff and to certain schools, former Model C schools,  having
a large number of noneducators on their staff as  well.  This  is  something
that needs to be looked at in order to improve education for all across  the
province. These figures actually mask the fact that there are still  schools
in our province, especially in Khayelitsha  and  Philippi,  that  have  more
than 50 and even sometimes 60 learners in a class.

Our province is also blessed  with  two  teaching  hospitals  and  the  only
specialised children's hospital in Africa, and  health  expenditure  is  the
second largest share of the provincial budget. But,  again,  these  benefits
mask some serious problems  that  we  have.  Our  province  has  the  lowest
expenditure on nonpersonnel, noncapital expenditure in  the  health  budget,
which means basically medicines and other  consumables.  There  has  been  a
real crisis with regard to the supply of medicines in  primary  health  care
facilities.

My constituency is Athlone. At the one-day hospital, the Dr  Abdurahman  Day
Hospital, there is an ongoing crisis  because  of  poor  management  in  the
provincial administration of the  supply  of  medicines  to  primary  health
care.

The last area I would like to highlight is  the  area  of  housing.  In  our
province the number of subsidies granted actually declined in 1998 to  2000.
This is largely due, again, to  problems  we  inherited  from  the  previous
government in the province, to maladministration and to  a  lack  of  proper
record-keeping in the province. One thing that we have been able to  ensure,
though, is that in the last year more than 100% of the subsidies  have  been
spent, and that will take place again this year. The MEC is trying  to  sort
out those problems.

I really welcome the opportunity to have contributed to this debate,  and  I
hope that there won't be a distortion  of  facts  on  the  province  in  the
future. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! I now call  the
hon the Minister of  Finance,  Mr  T  Manuel.  [Interjections.]  Hon  member
Dorothy, I am chairing this debate. [Interjections.]  The  next  speaker  is
the hon Minister of Finance, Mr T Ralane. [Interjections.] [Laughter.]

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Chairperson, may I express appreciation to all  the
members who have contributed to this debate and, perhaps  more  importantly,
to all distinguished members of the NCOP who have been  involved  in  taking
the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review out of this room and into the  provinces
for discussion since it was tabled on 8 April.

We said previously that we would table the IGFR probably ever  second  year,
allowing us to get more detailed discussion, and  ensuring,  also,  that  we
have a lot  more  nonfinancial  information  of  higher  quality  available,
because that clearly facilitates the discussion.

Listening to the debate here this afternoon,  I  think  that  we  were  well
advised to have done it in the way that we did. But I think it is  important
that we, again, contextualise the wider discussion. The wider discussion  is
one of intergovernmental fiscal relations. There are very sound reasons  why
we should develop the  best  possible  systems,  jealously  guard  them  and
ensure that we can match budget with outputs.

This is also to ensure that we can have available, certainly in this  House,
the best possible information and an early-warning system that will talk  to
us,  because  around  the  world  now  we  are  seeing  that  many  of   the
difficulties faced - even in some of the world's  largest  economies  -  are
often less as a result of what happens at a central level than what  happens
in the other spheres of government.

The US has all manner of complex fiscal difficulties  at  a  federal  level.
Whereas for years the states  of  the  United  States  had  been  debt-free,
deficit-free, this position now no longer obtains. One of the key  questions
that many analysts are asking about the  United  States  is:  How  will  the
states be able to raise the revenues to deal with  the  services  that  they
must deal with, because it is unlikely that the federal administration  will
have the resources to be able to make transfers? Because  there  has  always
been so much wealth in the US, it had not actually developed a  system  like
our intergovernmental fiscal relations system, with an outside  agency  like
the FFC, with a very clear  formula  and  with  systems  that  would  inform
decision-making in that country.

The Big Apple, New York, is in the throes of a deep  fiscal  crisis.  It  is
interesting that you now have one of the most  successful  businessmen  from
New York, Michael Bloomberg, as the mayor and a city that is in  deep,  deep
crisis.

Similarly, if one looks at the largest economy in  Europe,  namely  Germany,
the problems are not at the federal level nor are they, at  this  stage,  in
the Länder, the states. The problems are the problems of  cities.  The  deep
tragedy is that those parts of Germany which remained unscathed after  World
War II - the buildings with a rich history  and  so  on  -  are  being  sold
because the cities need revenue and there are no other revenue sources.

Now, if we step back from the IGFR, which is the subject of  our  discussion
here, and observe trends  elsewhere  in  the  world,  then,  I  think,  this
amplifies the importance of the work being  undertaken  by  members  of  the
NCOP in dealing with the Intergovernmental Fiscal Review  in  the  way  that
they do. This is exceeding important.

Our system is young. We have to nurture it. I think that in the  make-up  of
legislative oversight, the Constitution gives a very distinct  role  to  the
NCOP of being the custodians of provincial  interests.  Of  course,  it  has
organically developed to also provide  custodianship  for  local  government
interests.  Let  me  express  appreciation  here,  because  I   think   that
custodianship  exists  and  I  think  the  debate  here  this  afternoon  is
sufficient testimony  to  the  fact  that  the  NCOP  is  taking  that  role
exceedingly seriously.

We tabled the IGFR, and I think it has been developed to ensure that we  can
strengthen accountability. But it now exists alongside  a  series  of  other
documents, and the interrelationship, I think, is one that we need  to  keep
alive.

The first of these is that in all of our functions we now publish  Estimates
of national expenditure. The Estimates  must  also  carry  along  with  them
measurable objectives.  Departments  are  required  by  the  PFMA  to  table
strategic plans, and that has now  been  developed  into  the  provinces  to
ensure that their provincial departments also table strategic plans.

Now, we would ask, as we take  forward  this  process  of  intergovernmental
relations, that members of this House observe the alignment  and  talk  back
to us about the alignment or misalignment of those kinds of programmes.  The
same measurable objectives that we now publish as  part  of  a  contract  at
national level should be there in the provinces. May I add,  going  forward,
that local government should be dealing with  issues  in  exactly  the  same
way. It is about accountability. It is about the executive creating  a  very
special place for legislatures to be involved and to talk to these issues.

Similarly, one of the developments in terms of the PFMA  is  tied  into  the
reporting in terms of section 32, which requires of us at a  national  level
to publish monthly expenditures, actual  expenditures  for  the  month,  for
provinces to do the same in provincial gazettes, and  for  us  to  undertake
this  on  behalf  of  national  and  provincial  government  together  on  a
quarterly basis.

Now, in terms of the oversight - and I was hoping to  speak  after  the  hon
Ralane - the budget committee is actually doing  the  analysis.  I  want  to
implore other committees in this House to draw on the  work  being  done  by
the budget committee, because I think it  strengthens  the  oversight  in  a
very distinct way.

It would be remiss of me if I didn't express  our  sincere  appreciation  to
the hon Ralane and members of the budget committee for that work  and  also,
at the same time from where  I  am  sitting,  to  say  to  you,  members  of
Parliament and members of the National Council of Provinces, that  it  helps
us when other committees stream off the work done by  the  budget  committee
to improve on accountability,  so  that  we  don't  wait  for  the  Auditor-
General's reports but can in fact see what is happening as we proceed.

The first issue is about strengthening accountability. Later  we  will  come
with statistics, as the IGFR does, but we don't have to wait that  long.  It
is very important that members of Parliament, as a very  intrinsic  part  of
that custodianship role, exercise that oversight by looking at  the  figures
as they are published.

In respect of the oversight role, I think we need to hear - and  let  me  be
blunt because part of my job is to take a big spoon and stir trouble -  that
I hear more praise than  concerns  about  the  IGFR.  Now,  we  listen  very
carefully. Even if the Deputy Minister and I are not in the House,  we  have
very diligent officials - Shahied Khan and his team -  who  are  around  the
place, who sit in committees, who sit in  front  of  a  television  set  and
advise us.

The things we are looking for are the ways in which we can  improve  on  the
IGFR. We need to know what is  not  there  and  what  would  be  useful  for
Parliament to have, because we want this democracy to  work.  We  have  come
too far; we have sacrificed too much to be  light-hearted  about  democracy.
If we want democracy to work, then I  think  it  will  work  because  we  as
legislators together, as decision-makers together, know that  it  works.  We
will know that it works because our people tell us that it  works.  We  will
know that it works because we close the gap between that  which  we  plan  -
and the budget is essentially a plan - and what the money buys. So what  the
money buys is informed by the  quality  of  information  that  we  can  make
available to our legislators at any given time, because for us democracy  is
about a contract with our people. The key element of  that  contract  is  to
improve on the quality of life of everybody, but with  a  very  special  and
affirmative focus on the poorest of our  people.  We  must  be  unapologetic
about that.

I'm glad that members referred repeatedly to the  Freedom  Charter,  because
it's a tradition that we have to take forward.  We  aren't  first-generation
democrats. This is a tradition that we must take forward.  Even  before  the
Freedom Charter, there was the African Claims which has an anniversary  this
year as well. We have to take those traditions forward, and we can  only  do
so if our decision-making is well-informed.

We have heard this afternoon that, yes, we are in a much better  place  than
many other countries. We have heard, encouragingly, of the discussion  about
the outputs  reported  on  in  the  IGFR  that  have  been  taken  into  the
provinces. I think,  going  forward,  that  we  want  the  same  quality  of
discussion in respect of cities and towns.

However, I didn't hear  enough  this  afternoon  in  the  debate  about  the
people's skills. Members and delegates from the Eastern Cape may know  about
the fact that we need, I think, 6 440, staff in critical-skill areas in  the
Eastern Cape. The bulk of them, incidentally, would be in health services  -
doctors,  specialists,  physiotherapists,  speech  therapists,  professional
nurses, nursing assistants and people like those.  At  the  same  time,  the
province has about an equal number of people with very few skills.  That  is
why we want to get these numbers right.

The same kinds of issues would apply in every province. There  is  no  point
in our having amongst the best  policies  on  health  and  the  delivery  of
primary health care anywhere in  the  world,  but  then  we  find  that  the
poorest don't have access because we  can't  get  doctors  and  professional
nurses to work in the rural areas of Engcobo, Mqanduli, Mgwali and  wherever
else ... [Interjections.] ... and Whittlesea,  of  course.  [Laughter.]  The
poorest of the poor are disadvantaged - they can't get to big  hospitals  in
Umtata and Bisho and King William's Town. The premise of our  health  policy
is primary health care. If we want primary health care then we must be  able
to deliver. This also means that part of  our  political  work  must  be  to
convince our people to join the Public Service.

The  Minister  of  Health  advises  that  probably  outside  of  the  larger
hospitals in the Eastern Cape there is an overreliance on  foreign  doctors.
Now why aren't we producing our own doctors? These are the issues, but  they
are the next-phase issues.

I am expressing appreciation for the work done, for  the  content,  for  the
quality and for the depth of analysis. I would like to clearly  express  our
appreciation. I speak on behalf of the Deputy Minister  and  myself  to  the
hon Qedani Mahlangu, the select committee and  also  the  budget  committee,
and to all the members for the work that  they've  done.  This  feedback  is
exceedingly important for us. We think that not only for us sitting  in  the
Treasury, but for all South Africans that it enriches our democracy, but  we
say: ``Let's do more.''

Part of what we must do more of is to be advised about the way in  which  we
disperse professionals across the country, and about the things we  are  not
doing quite right, because I think we want to have a democracy  that  allows
us to live up to the words that Amilcar Cabral used: Mask  no  difficulties,
tell no lies and claim no easy victories. That should shape  our  democracy,
that should shape our contract with the people, and  the  IGFR  is  but  one
piece  in  making  that  truthful  democracy  possible.  Thank  very   much.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Thank  you,  hon
Minister. Hon member Dorothy, you now know why Mr Ralane did  not  speak.  I
hope that Treasury will not poach him. He is still a member  of  Parliament.
Hon members, that concludes  the  debate  on  the  Intergovernmental  Fiscal

COMMITTEE REPORTS:

National Assembly and National Council of Provinces:

1.    Report of the Ad Hoc Joint Committee on  Reparations,  dated  24  June
     2003:


     1.     Introduction


         The Ad Hoc Joint Committee on Reparations (the Committee) has  been
         established by decision of the Speaker and the Chairperson  of  the
         National Council of Provinces to consider recommendations  made  by
         the President in terms of section 27 of the Promotion  of  National
         Unity and Reconciliation Act (Act No. 34 of 1995).


         The Committee first  met  on  3  June  2003  and  elected  two  co-
         chairpersons, Mr A Mlangeni and Ms N C  Kondlo,  according  to  the
         Rule 55 of the Joint Rules of Parliament.  The  Committee  met  for
         the  second  time  on  10  June  2003  and  identified   four   key
         recommendations from the President's speech delivered to the  Joint
         Sitting of Parliament held on 15 April 2003, namely:


         (i) symbols and  monuments;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  communities;
         (iii) medical benefits and other forms of  social  assistance;  and
         (iv) final reparations.


         The Committee also appointed a subcommittee  to  advise  it  on  an
         appropriate response by Parliament to  these  recommendations.  The
         subcommittee met on  11,  12,  17  and  23  June  to  consider  the
         recommendations, as well as written  public  comments  received  in
         this regard, and submitted a report to the Committee  on  24  June,
         which report was accepted and adopted as the final  report  of  the
         Committee.


     2.     Context


         The Committee proposes that the four recommendations identified  be
         grouped into two main categories, namely:
         *  Recommendations that seek to redress injustices of the  past  in
              a more holistic manner  by  focusing  on  gross  human  rights
              violations inflicted upon whole communities  and  the  broader
              society, on the one hand; and


         *   Recommendations  that  seek  to  redress  gross  human   rights
              violations suffered by individual victims  identified  through
              the TRC process by granting them some degree of relief.


         A view was expressed, but not carried, that victims as  defined  in
         the Act and the reparations due to them, as defined,  are  governed
         by sections 3, 4, 5, 25, and 26 of the Act, and  that  symbolic  or
         community recognition cannot serve as a substitute  for  inadequate
         individual reparations. Alongside adequate reparations, they  would
         be a welcome addition.


         The  Committee  rejects  the  assertion  that  the  Act  was  aimed
         exclusively at the granting of reparation to individuals  only  and
         not in granting redress to communities and the broader society  for
         harm suffered as a result of gross human rights violations  of  the
         past.


         In addition, the Committee rejects  the  contention  that  symbolic
         and community recognition  serves  as  a  substitute  for  what  is
         perceived to be inadequate individual reparation.


     3.     Recommendations


         3.1     Symbols and Monuments


              The Committee supports the President's recommendation  calling
              for systematic programmes to project the symbolism of struggle
              and the ideal of freedom through academic and informal records
              of history, cultural  and  art  forms,  erecting  symbols  and
              monuments that  exalt  the  freedom  struggle,  including  new
              geographic and place names.


              The Committee notes the work that  has  already  commenced  at
              various levels of government in  this  regard.  This  includes
              work-in-progress towards the establishment  of  Freedom  Park,
              the Garden of Peace and the renaming of streets and  towns  in
              various parts of the country.


              The Committee, having deliberated on the matter,  agrees  that
              the focus here is on the struggle  that  led  to  the  current
              democratic dispensation ushered in by the  new  constitutional
              order in 1994. In this regard, the Committee,  having  further
              deliberated on the matter, is  of  the  view  that  unity  and
              reconciliation should also be projected in such symbols.


         3.2     Rehabilitation of Communities


              The Committee supports  the  government's  commitment  to  the
              continued payment of special emphasis on the rehabilitation of
              communities that were subjected to intense  acts  of  violence
              and destruction. The Committee notes the work that has already
              begun in this area and endorses the  focus  on  a  partnership
              approach between communities and government in pursuit of this
              objective.


              The Committee, having deliberated extensively on  the  matter,
              agrees with the view that not only individuals but also  whole
              communities suffered and are still in distress.  It  therefore
              recognises the need for such communities to  be  rehabilitated
              through  various  programmes,  such  as  alluded  to  by   the
              President.


         3.3     Medical Benefits and other forms of Social assistance


              With regard  to  the  specific  cases  of  individual  victims
              identified by the Act, the Committee notes the assurance given
              by the President of programmes put in  place  to  provide  for
              medical  benefits,  education  assistance  and  provision   of
              housing as well as other social benefits to address the  needs
              of individual victims identified by the Act.


              In this regard, the Committee's attention  was  drawn  to  the
              assertion  in  the  TRC  report  that  "the  failure  of   the
              responsible  government  bodies  to   provide   the   required
              information,  combined  with  the  fact  that  victims  return
              constantly to the President's Fund and the  RRC  empty-handed,
              points to a complete breakdown in the agreement forged between
              government (inter-Ministerial Committee on Reparation) and the
              RRC". 1


              The Committee therefore proposes that Parliament, in line with
              its oversight  role,  be  provided  with  regular  reports  by
              government on progress made in this regard  at  least  once  a
              year.


         3.4     Final Reparations


              The   Committee,    having    considered    the    President's
              recommendations  regarding  final  reparations,  endorses  the
              commitment of the government to provide  a  one-off  grant  of
              R30,000 to those individuals or survivors  designated  by  the
              TRC, over and above the  other  material  commitments  already
              mentioned.


              The Committee notes, but does not accept, the contentions  put
              forward that the amount proposed is  inadequate  and  that  at
              minimum the 2 975 declared victims whose rights to seek  legal
              recourse against successful  amnesty  applicants  for  damages
              have been extinguished, are  entitled  to  assessment  of  the
              losses suffered and to commensurate compensation.


     4.     Conclusion


         The Committee therefore recommends that Parliament accept the  four
         recommendations made  by  the  President,  as  identified  in  this
         Report. Further, the Committee anticipates that all  the  necessary
         practical arrangements for the effective  implementation  of  these
         recommendations will be provided  for  in  the  regulations  to  be
         promulgated and implemented by the  President  in  accordance  with
         the provisions of the Act.
