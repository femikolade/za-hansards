                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Mr N M RAJU: Thank you, Chair. I give notice that at  the  next  sitting  of
the House I shall move:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that former ANC Chief Whip Tony Yengeni, having pleaded  guilty
       to defrauding Parliament by not disclosing  the  discount  on  a  car
       purchased from a company involved in the arms deal, has resigned from
       Parliament;


  (2) welcomes with approbation the  valiant  act  of  Frene  Ginwala,  the
       Speaker of the national Parliament when, in a crusade to  defend  the
       dignity and honour of South Africa's nascent and  fragile  democracy,
       she had proposed that Tony Yengeni should resign from Parliament ...

The CHIEF WHIP OF THE COUNCIL: Deputy Chairperson, on a point  of  order:  I
would have imagined that the hon Nelson Raju would have been  aware  of  the
fact the Speaker is the Speaker of the National  Assembly  and  not  of  the
national Parliament. Tony Yengeni was the Chief Whip of the  Majority  Party
in the National Assembly and not of Parliament as such.  Perhaps  he  should
consult with the  ANC  so  that  we  could  educate  him  in  terms  of  the
constitutional dispensation. Thank you.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Just bearing  in  mind
that remark, continue, hon Raju.

Mr N M RAJU:


  (2) welcomes with approbation the  valiant  act  of  Frene  Ginwala,  the
       Speaker of the national Parliament ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  Raju,
there's no Speaker of the national Parliament. [Interjections.]
Mr N M RAJU: The Speaker of the National Assembly, Sir.

The  DEPUTY  CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M   J   Mahlangu):   Continue.
[Interjections.]

Mr N M RAJU: Sorry.


       ... when, in a crusade to defend the  dignity  and  honour  of  South
       Africa's nascent and fragile democracy, she had  proposed  that  Tony
       Yengeni should resign from Parliament,  in  the  face  of  unbecoming
       dilatoriness by his honourable colleagues in the  ruling  party  from
       acting decisively in this sordid affair, much like an umpire's limpid
       response when asked ``how's that?'' after  the  batsman  was  clearly
       caught behind - ``I leave the decision to the batsman's conscience!''

                          OPPOSITION TO WAR ON IRAQ

  [That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  war might soon be waged against Iraq;
       (b)  America and Britain are encouraging the world to wage this war;


       (c)  such a war would adversely  affect  the  future  of  the  entire
           African continent, bring misery to innocent orphans, widows  and
           the aged  in  Iraq  and  perpetuate  hate  against  the  pro-war
           countries;


  (2) calls on -

           Government in its efforts to dissuade those two  countries  from
           going to war against Iraq;


       (b)  the world to wait for the report of the  inspectors  to  see  if

           and stand by the UN's decision on the matter;

           mass destruction, Israel, America, Britain  and  all  the  other
           countries that have such weapons should follow suit; and


       (b)  all people should be totally opposed to any form of war.]

[Applause.]

Mr G A LUCAS: Chairperson, I would just like to move as an amendment:

             GOVERNMENT'S FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION PROGRAMME

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Deputy Chair, I rise on behalf of the ANC to  move  without
notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with pride -


       (a)   the  unwavering  commitment  of  the  Government,  through  the
           integrated food security and nutrition programme  to  push  back
           the frontiers of poverty among vulnerable  groups  who,  due  to
           poverty and  rising  food  prices  cannot  afford  adequate  and
           nutritious food;


       (b)  that the Government has set aside  R1,2  billion  for  the  next
           three years, with R400 million targeted for 2002/2003;


       (c)  that R230 million is earmarked to benefit an estimated  200  000
           poor households over the next three months;


  (2) calls on community leaders and particularly public representatives to
       play a critical role  in  ensuring  that  the  food  parcels  benefit
       rightful beneficiaries; and


  (3) congratulates the Government on its consistency in pushing  back  the
       frontiers of poverty.

                INCREASED NUMBER OF TOURISTS TO SOUTH AFRICA
                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, I hereby move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  6,4 million tourists visited South Africa last year, an increase
           of 1,8 million on 2001 figures;


       (b)  whilst the rest of the world  has  experienced  a  drop  in  the
           number of tourists to every tourist destination, South Africa is
           now the fastest growing tourist destination in the world;


       (c)  while the Kruger National Park and  Cape  Town  were  the  major
           attractions, many tourists were also venturing into other  parts
           of the country; and


       (d)  the experience that the tourists got from locals of all walks of
           life was apparently the biggest factor in the growth of tourism;
           and
  (2) in the light of the fact that tourism is one of the quickest and most
       effective ways of providing much-needed cash injections and more  job
       opportunities  in  local  economies,   urges   all   the   provincial
       legislatures, provincial governments, local  authorities,  businesses
       and  residents  to  develop  the  potential  for  tourism  in   their
       respective provinces and communities to the fullest, for  example  in
       this area where the Council is sitting  today,  the  site  where  the
       Taung skull was found, as this will contribute significantly  to  the
       eradication of poverty amongst all our people.

[Applause.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

       is soon to be processed there into oleoresin,  an  extracted  paprika
       oil and paprika powder for the Dutch market;

       for the impoverished surrounding communities.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mrs E N LUBIDLA: Chairperson, I wish to move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the account of an orphaned student has been handed over to  debt
           collectors for owing R50 in school fees;


       (b)  Lunga Kowani, 18 of Lungisa  High  School  in  Humansdorp,  only
           managed to pay half of his fees of R100 last year;


       (c)  he  received  a  letter  of  demand  from  lawyers,  Snyman  and
           Partners, insisting that he settles the amount which  had  risen
           to R80 including interest and VAT; and


       (d)  Lungisa High School handed over a total of 76 accounts of pupils
           owing the school;

       have been handed over to debt collectors;


  (3) further notes that orphans automatically qualify for  exemption  from
       paying school fees; and

       immediately.

             ELIMINATION OF SOUTH AFRICA FROM CRICKET WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Deputy Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the general perception seems to  be  that  Providence  conspired
           with the elements to disqualify the SA Proteas  from  proceeding
           to the Super Six stage of the Cricket World  Cup  fixtures  when
           they played Sri Lanka at Kingsmead on Monday, 3 March 2003;


       (b)  this unfortunate result visited  upon  the  nation's  cricketing
           warriors has filled the South African public with deep  despair,
           consternation and grief;
  (2) expects the South African cricketers to refrain from making  nebulous
       complaints about rain, Duckworth-Lewis, luck, injuries, the media and
       other excuses to distract attention from poor performances; and


  (3) calls upon the nation to support the World Cup and  to  rally  behind
       our co-hosts Zimbabwe and Kenya who, having qualified  to  the  Super
       Six level, are vying with each  other  to  carry  the  flag  for  all
       Africa.

[Applause.]

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

future.] (Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[... we meet here in Mmabana, Taung, after meeting  with  the  community  of
Taung, ie the youth, our mothers, the elderly, etc.  We  met  these  people,
who came from all the  areas  of  Taung,  and  they  briefed  us  about  the
problems they  are  experiencing.  We  as  members  of  Parliament  listened
attentively to these people and concluded, just as we did when we came  into
Government in 1994, that we have  a  huge  task  ahead  of  us  in  fighting
poverty and hunger; more especially we, the members of the ANC.

We realised, as members of Parliament, that there were obstacles  that  were
making it  difficult  to  fight  poverty  and  hunger,  and  our  challenge,
together with the people we met over the past two days, is to find  ways  to
work together to eradicate this poverty.

For many years our people, more especially Africans,  were  oppressed.  That
is why, when one goes to any corner of South Africa, one still comes  across
many people who are still  suffering  because  of  the  previous  oppressive
government. However, we as members of the ANC, together with  those  members
of Parliament who want to improve our people's lives, are saying that ...]

obstacles on our road to fighting and eradicating this poverty, but  we  are

paragraphs follows.)

[You would agree with me  that  fighting  poverty  is  at  the  top  of  our
Government's priority programmes. Just to show that this programme is a  top
priority, on 12 February 2003  the  country's  President,  Mr  Thabo  Mbeki,
speaking on behalf of the ANC in the Bafokeng area here in the  North  West,
said:


  We should pay particular attention to the struggle against poverty.  This
  must entail  a  detailed  and  integrated  programme  of  action  against
  poverty.

That is what the President said in Phokeng, here in  the  North  West.  That
shows that the ANC deems it necessary for  us  to  work  hard  to  eradicate
poverty in South Africa this century.

On the question of prevailing  conditions  in  the  country,  the  President
said:


  Our country has a continuing task to push back the frontiers  of  poverty
  and expand access to a better life for all.

The President was showing the people gathered at Phokeng  that  what  we  as
the ANC say is not a lie. We as the ANC do not promise people this and  that
just so that they would vote for us. He went back to Parliament, where  laws
are made and then implemented. He told us in the Parliament of South  Africa
that it is very important to fight poverty, and said  that  we  should  have
programmes in place to do that. That is what the President said.

You will recall that we have nine provinces in South Africa, and one of  the
most important ones is the North West province. Picking up  from  where  the
President left off, the Premier of the North West, Mr  Popo  Molefe,  had  a
good place to start. He started the trend in Phokeng and followed it  up  in
Cape Town, after which he came back here. He wanted to make  sure  that  our
message reaches the people of Taung and of the North West.  In  his  speech,
he said:


  The economy is not growing fast enough to respond  more  aggressively  to
  the challenges of poverty and joblessness. There  is  a  section  of  our
  workforce that is unemployable.

He also said that in an effort to fight poverty and hunger, our  economy  is
growing, even though this is not happening as fast as we would want  it  to.
It is important for us to make it grow at the speed we envisage,  to  ensure
that in the future our people, who are  still  poor,  become  part  of  this
economy. That will ensure that at  night  our  people  have  food  on  their
tables, and water to drink, just like this tasty  water  that  I'm  drinking
now. That is what he was talking about.

He went on to say that a lot of people,  more  especially  the  youth,  take
courses and go on to finish their degrees, etc, but  many  of  them  end  up
unemployed because the courses they do are not in demand,  so  usually  many
of them become teachers, as opposed to engineers, and so on.

He said that  one  of  the  most  important  things  done  by  the  national
Government was to train people, so as to enable  them  to  be  part  of  the
economy and move forward with us. That is what Mr Molefe  said,  taking  his
cue from the President. I believe that we all agree with him on this  point.
[Interjections.]]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  member,
your speaking time has expired. [Laughter.] [Applause.]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Chair, I thought I had 10 minutes.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Order! Yes, you did.

Mr P NOE (Free State): Hon Chairperson of the NCOP, Deputy Chair,  permanent
and special delegates, executive mayors, Speakers, councillors  and  members
of the community, it is indeed true  that  the  main  challenge  facing  our
country today is to continue with the reconstruction and development of  our
country, but at a faster pace for the eradication of the remaining  remnants
of colonialism and apartheid.

At the core of this  challenge  is  the  objective  of  the  eradication  of
poverty, and hence we have adopted  the  appropriate  programme  of  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty. Given the  nature  of  the  problem  we  have
inherited, it will take time and  a  united  national  effort  to  eradicate
poverty in our country. This statement, however, is not intended to  justify
inaction  and  indecisiveness  on  our  part.  While  the  main  traditional
employment sectors, that is the  public  and  private  sectors,  government,
mining,  agriculture  and  manufacturing,  have  scaled  down  their  labour
absorption, it  does  not  mean  that  they  have  been  absolved  of  their
obligations towards the efforts of job creation initiatives.

The Government has identified and rolled out concrete programmes to  make  a
significant impact on  the  fight  against  poverty.  In  this  regard,  the
acceleration of programmes in the rural development and urban renewal  nodes
has received prime attention.

Deputy  Chairperson,  allow  me  therefore  to   highlight   some   critical
interventions made  by  the  Free  State  government  in  pushing  back  the
frontiers of poverty through the people development cluster, comprising  the
following  departments:  education,  agriculture,  social  development   and
sports, arts, culture, science and technology. Hovever, I  will  only  focus
on one department, that is  the  department  of  agriculture,  as  I  cannot
mention all the departments.

The department of agriculture in our province has about 146  community-based
projects currently running. The  first  one  is  poultry,  which  was  kick-
started last year in November and has created  about  42  sustainable  jobs.
This programme generates in the region  of  R114 000  per  week.  They  have
their own chicken abattoir and keep in stock at least 100 chickens.

Secondly, the apple project currently sustains about  102  families  on  the
farm. This is one of the exporting projects in small-scale farming  that  we
as a province are proud of.

Thirdly,  we  have  about   246   Land   Redistribution   for   Agricultural
Development, or LRAD, projects, which  were  kick-started  in  August  2001,
benefiting  about  1 642  households,  and  I  can  mention  three  of   the
activities going on there.  One  is  the  dairy,  which  sustains  about  50
families, and there are those who keep sheep. If I  may  scare  you  now  by
talking about their bank balance, they have R58 000 in the  bank  and  those
who keep livestock have, as I speak, R186 000.

Last, but not least, the food  security  project  kick-started  in  December
2002 currently benefits  72  families.  One  example  is  that  each  family
receives garden implements worth R4 500 and is supplied with seed  to  start
up home gardens and with food packages for at least  three  months  to  give
the family  a  start.  The  families  benefiting  from  this  programme  are
destitute families that make an income of at least R200 and  also  HIV/Aids-
affected or child-headed families. It is intended to expand  this  programme
to the schools, so that parents who cannot afford to pay  school  fees  will
be required to work in the school gardens as their contribution.

As for the community-based public works  programme,  currently  about  seven
community projects are running. This includes the  renovation  of  community
halls and clinics and the erection of crèches  and  community  halls.  These
projects employ in the region of 20 to 30 people, biased to  women  and  the
youth. They also offer accredited training, and the  number  of  people  who
have been trained as we are talking now is about 232 in skills that  pertain
to emerging entrepreneurs, carpentry, painting and management  skills.  This
includes Abet training in literacy and numeracy  for  at  least  12  months,
because we know that most of the people that respond to  these  projects  do
not have basic education. This is one contribution of the projects.

Also we know that there are people who  have  been  working  with  the  main
contractors who have not been able to obtain certificates but  have  skills.
We have engaged the Department of Labour in this regard  to  accredit  these
people,  and,  as  we  speak  today,   they   are   certified   as   skilled
entrepreneurs.

Let me now focus on legislation. It has become  imperative  to  ensure  that
every programme that Government introduces is protected by legislation to  a
certain extent. Programmes have collapsed before they can even take off,  or
even end in the middle of nowhere,  precisely  because  of  the  absence  of
regulatory measures. Unscrupulous people have also taken  the  advantage  of
this shortcoming by robbing those living in poverty and simply getting  away
with it. It often happens that people are awarded tenders by government  and
then fail to honour certain service standards or to meet their  obligations.
Just to give an example, a contractor will fail to pay his or her  employees
or will cheat a subcontractor.

In that scenario a government is not able to intervene immediately,  and  in
the meantime the project suffers to the extent that it is suspended and  the
affected people sometimes threaten to go on strike. We saw a  clear  example
when we visited one of the schools. At Mabalane  Middle  School,  a  project
which started last year in August is now  on  hold  because  the  contractor
alleges that he does not have money and people have not been  paid  for  two
months - and there is nothing that the government can  do.  [Time  expired.]
[Applause.]

Mrs B SONO: Thank you, Chair, the two previous  speakers  set  a  precedent.
Because there are no stairs on the other side that I could use, I have  just
quickly written a letter to the Table to see if protocol would allow  me  to
pass in front of the Chairperson in order to approach the podium.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  It's  fine,  we'll
break that rule. You can come, it's OK. Come through.

[Applause.]

Mrs B N SONO: Thank you, Deputy Chair.

Ke tla kopa gore lo ntetleng go bua sekgowa, ka  gonne  Setswana  sa  me  se

action, black empowerment, jalo jalo.  (Translation  of  Setswana  paragraph
follows.)

[I would request that I be allowed to speak English, because my Setswana  is
very weak. But I will try my best. Improving the people's  economy  -  which
was destroyed by the apartheid government - with the  intention  of  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty is not child's play. We as the DP  agree  with
most of the programmes set by Government,  ie  laws  like  the  equity  law,
affirmative action, black empowerment, etc.]

Excessive legislation becomes a bit problematic. The  DP  is  in  favour  of
restricted legislation controls and regulations  regarding  the  development
of an economy and addressing employment creation. The DP  believes  strongly
in the creative powers of the people. In state policies  and  measures,  the
focus should be geared towards creating conditions for innovation  in  order
for people to flourish.

Since 1999, both Houses, the NCOP and the  National  Assembly,  have  passed
many laws which have  required  that  statutory  bodies  be  established  to
oversee compliance, but not much attention has been given to  implementation
of policies and measures, even the very laws that have been enacted.

I'll give an example of a problem that gets created by that. If you look  at
all the departmental budgets, taking even the national Budget  and  all  the
state's departmental budgets, you'll see that 65%, or  close  to  75%,  goes
towards salaries for bureaucracies. Plus-minus 25% or 30% then goes  to  the
actual implementation  of  programmes  and  measures  that  could  help  the
ordinary man in the street.

For example, we recently passed a piece of  legislation,  Merchandise  Marks
Amendment Bill, which was  passed  particularly  to  oversee  what  we  call
ambush marketing for the duration of  the  cricket  series.  There  are  two
provinces which have cricket stadiums in  the  townships.  One  is  in  Port
Elizabeth and the other one is in Soweto.

That ambush marketing amendment allowed the cricket board to  penalise  even
the  selling  of  products  like  Coca-Cola  and  the  wearing  of  T-shirts
displaying the Coca-Cola emblem. All those people had to be 200 metres  away
from the stadiums.

Sa ntlha, batho ba rona ga ba na  kitso.  Sa  bobedi,  bomme  ba  tshola  di
``cooler bags'' go ya go  rekisa  fa  go  na  le  metshameko  e  metona  kwa
mapatlelong. (Translation of Setswana paragraph follows.)

[Firstly, our people lack knowledge. Secondly, women carry  cooler  bags  to
go and sell their wares whenever there is a big match at the stadium.]
Because of that type of legislation, for instance, for the duration  of  the
cricket series, we haven't been able to help the very  people  that  we  are
supposed to be helping. When we legislate excessively,  we  really  need  to
look at how that legislation impacts on the very goals of Government.

Ka Mosupologo fa re goroga, re etetse dikolo tse di jaaka, sekolo  sa  loago
kwa Bogasing. [On Monday, when  we  arrived  we  visited  schools  like  the
community school at Bogasing.]

It is a community school that we visited. For all these years  it  had  good
results, comparable to those of a state-sponsored school, and it is  a  very
poor school.  Because  of  the  law  and  the  formula  that  is  in  place,
consideration was never given to how one ought to develop such  schools  and
extract them from the poverty trap.

Ke gore go di kgontsa go fitlhelela maemo a a  tshwanetseng.  [That  is,  to
enable them to reach the required standard.]

Equitable share is not possible. When we legislate and when we  make  policy
measures, we really need to take into consideration.
Se re se lemogileng gape ke gore ... [Again, what we have observed  is  that
... ]

... the Taung Heritage Site has been declared a World Heritage Site.

Fa re ne re etetse dikolo tse, palo ya basetsana ba ba ithutelang saense  mo
phaposing e ne e le 30. [When we visited these schools, we  found  that  the
number of girls studying science was about 30 per classroom.]

We can legislate now. We have the instruments. There is affirmative  action.
We need to start synergising. Legislation is in place and  it's  a  national
competency of the National Council of Provinces to come  out  with  measures
and policies  that  will  start  synergising  and  seeing  to  it  that  the
legislation that has been enacted starts impacting on our people.

For instance, when I was looking at  it,  there  was  a  classroom  full  of
children who were doing science. The hon Khunwana  lamented  the  fact  that
this was a mining town. The infrastructure is there. We got  to  learn  when
we went there that they exported lime, and the best was exported out of  the
province. But can we create secondary industries out of what  is  remaining,
because the infrastructure is there. [Time expired.]

Mr  S  H  GQOBANA  (Eastern  Cape):  Chairperson  of  the  NCOP,   permanent
delegates,  special   delegates   from   various   provinces,   councillors,
traditional leaders and our people, I greet you in the name of  the  Eastern
Cape. [Interjections.] Hon Deputy Chair, I am not going to waste  my  little
time by responding to the previous speaker.

The  transition  to  economic  prosperity  is  accompanied  by  a  corrosive
poverty, more especially in the rural areas of our province. There  is  also
a glaring infrastructural backlog. Against  this  background,  the  province
has developed and designed a rural development  strategy.  Central  to  this
perspective is the integrated food security programme, an  attempt  to  meet
the basic food requirements. The land redistribution agricultural  programme
has made more land available to the communal farmers in the province.

It has become clear to the provincial government that four  departments  are
critical and that  they  must  take  the  forefront  in  the  fight  against
poverty. Those departments are health, agriculture, social  development  and
local government. The focus of government is on the massive food  production
programme, and aligned to the programme is rapid food production,  which  is
intended  for  households.  The  department  of   agriculture   is   helping
households with agricultural imports and  technical  expertise  provided  by
agricultural extension officers. On the massive food front,  the  department
requires the  development  of  entrepreneurs  who  would  be  assisted  with
tractors so that mechanisation can take place as soon as possible.

In pushing back the frontiers of poverty, firstly  we  need  to  produce  as
much food as possible. Secondly, irrigation infrastructure must  be  put  in
place in areas which receive less than 600 mm of rain a year. These are  not
merely plans. As we speak, some tractors  have  been  secured.  The  Freedom
Charter provides that the state will buy equipment and tractors for  peasant
farmers, and if they were peasant farmers in 1955,  that  has  not  changed;
they are still peasant farmers. It is only the movement  that  changed  this
from the bondage of poverty to economic prosperity.

In the majority of the fields our first co-operatives are now being  formed.
Fields are  grouped  together  so  that  these  co-operatives  are  easy  to
establish. The departments of agriculture, social  development  and  health,
as well as local government, using  the  IDP,  are  now  establishing  local
economic development zones. Underpinning this process is  mechanisation  for
crop, food and fibre production.

Commodity groupings are in place. These are the  groups  that  must  produce
for the province, and the government has  put  together  a  crop  scheme  to
assist these groups,  and  not  only  with  technical  resources.  The  core
business of these groups is commodity production. In the maize  belt,  which
ranges from 600 mm to 1 200 mm of rain, the  land  has  been  prepared  and,
with financial assistance, is expected to move from 50 000 tons of maize  to
500 000 tons in a period of  five  years.  The  agricultural  potential  has
already been determined scientifically, and all we require now  is  to  walk
the talk.

Community gardens are designed  to  produce  more  than  ever  before,  with
financial assistance from the departments of social development and  health.
With the conditional grants from those departments and  with  the  technical
expertise from the department of agriculture, community  gardens  are  ready
to fly. These  community  gardens  are  intended  even  to  assist  the  HIV
patients by making sure that we boost their immune system. With  Vukuzenzele
we have noticed that the role that women, as  usual,  have  played  is  very
important. In this case the fencing in the greater part of Transkei is  done
by women.

We are confident, as the Eastern Cape government, that change, as driven  by
the ANC, will never falter.

The other important area which I think I must touch on is the progress  that
has  been  made  in  relation  to  the  social  development.  There  is   an
interdepartmental approach involving social development,  home  affairs  and
health to ensure access to social grants. In  this  particular  case,  there
are categories of poverty eradication programme that have been  implemented.
They include 18 food security programmes, 20 women's co-operatives, 20 dual-
purpose programmes and 10 HIV  programmes  that  have  been  implemented  to
date. Included in that list is one urban renewal programme.

Now,  with  respect  to  the  Integrated   Sustainable   Rural   Development
Programme, the following projects are now operational:  In  the  O  R  Tambo
region there are about 36 projects, and out of those 36, 29  are  funded  by
that municipality. In Alfred Nzo, 12 anchor projects are now  in  operation.
The specific projects can be accessed by the NCOP when required  under  each
of these nodal points. In Chris Hani 10 projects are now in progress and  in
Ukhahlamba 5 projects are in progress.

As we speak, there  is  a  project  under  social  development,  called  the
emergency food relief programme, which was launched yesterday and  in  which
8 800 families have managed to receive food  parcels.  In  relation  to  the
social relief of  distress  programme,  in  an  attempt  to  help  the  poor
families that are in need, normally the social development  department  used
to be allocated R16 million, but this  time  the  treasury  has  given  that
department about R98 million, which indicates that more people are going  to
benefit than usually was the case in previous years.

The last thing I would like to mention is that, despite all  gloomy  reports
and other reports in relation to the Eastern Cape, it is  important  that  I
should mention in particular, in relation to social development, that it  is
amongst the top departments, if indeed  there  are  any  others,  that  have
shifted from traditional welfare to social development in a  practical  way.
Secondly, it must also be mentioned that the department has implemented  the
installation of technological infrastructure in all of our districts,  which
is a critical part of an effective management information system.

The third point is that there is a one-stop youth justice  centre  which  is
operational as we speak in the province, and the communities  of  the  world
are sourcing expertise from the learning site of our  stepping-stone  centre
in Port Elizabeth.

Lastly, social development has been nominated for two Mpumelelo  awards  for
the implementation of the  bee-keeping  project  in  Libode.  I  thank  you.
[Applause.]

Dr P J C NEL: Hon Deputy Chair and hon members,  this  debate  is  a  timely
initiative from the NCOP for which the New NP  is  truly  grateful.  Because
the scale of poverty is so immense and the human  suffering  so  intense  in
our country, we require the maximum joint effort and the  greatest  national
consensus possible to tackle this giant problem. The time has come  for  all
South Africans to take hands  and  to  form  new  partnerships  between  the
different  communities  and  political  parties,  despite   past   political
differences, and for all other role-players in the country to  take  on  the
challenge as a nation.

Only if we do that will we be able to give hope to the  37%  of  our  people
who are unemployed, to the approximately 67% of  our  children  in  the  age
group 1-15 living in a defined state of absolute poverty, according  to  the
1996 census. One can go on and on quoting shocking statistics,  but  poverty
must never become just an issue of statistics. It is far more than that.  It
is about people, and we must put those people first. It is about  compassion
and the restoration of human dignity.

Poverty is generally seen, in all  its  manifestations,  as  the  denial  of
opportunities and  choices  most  basic  to  human  development  to  lead  a
healthy, creative life  and  to  enjoy  a  decent  standard  of  living  and
dignity.

South Africa's record in the fight against poverty is,  in  some  instances,
not really good. While the economy, our main  weapon  against  poverty,  has
performed well relative to other economies in the  region,  unemployment  is
still very high and continues to  rise.  With  an  estimated  quarter  of  a
million new job-seekers entering the labour market every year, South  Africa
faces enormous challenges.

The  New  NP  realises  that  job  creation  is  not  the  function  of  the
Government. Government, however, has  to  create  a  favourable  climate  to
stimulate the private business  sector  to  invest  in  projects  that  will
create jobs. Business has a key role to play in the economic  transformation
of the country.  We  appreciate  the  fact  that  certain  sections  of  the
business community play a commendable role in many respects. A company  like
SA  Breweries,  for  example,  spends  1,4%  of  its   pretax   profits   on
partnerships with NGOs, state departments and communities. More than 50%  of
the  money  goes  to  education,  training,  health  and  welfare.  This  is
commendable because education and training are the most important tools  for
empowering individuals to break free from the shackles of poverty.

There are many other examples of new public-private  partnerships  in  South
Africa. An excellent example is a partnership that was announced by the  hon
MEC for finance in the Free State in his budget speech on  5  March,  namely
that the government's provincial bank, Absa,  has  agreed  to  partner  with
government to ensure commercial loans and  facilitation  to  private  sector
operators  participating  in  projects,  in  each  instance  equal  to   the
contribution of the government up to a maximum of R50 million,  without  the
bank expecting  to  profit  from  its  involvement.  This  investment  will,
without any doubt, assist the Free  State  government  in  rolling  out  key
investment projects.

We also appreciate the fact that many businesses  donate  to  charities  and
cultural  development.  This  can,  however,  never  be  a  substitute   for
investing in the sustainable  development  of  people  and  contributing  to
social infrastructure.

There is still much room for  expanding  corporate  involvement  and  for  a
greater focus on targeted poverty alleviation projects,  and  all  people  -
coloured, black, white and Indian businesspeople - have  a  contribution  to
make. We are now at  a  point  in  history  where  we  together  can  devote
ourselves  to  economic  growth  and  development  and  the  destruction  of
poverty, not only for some, but  for  all  our  people.  We  must  create  a
country where opportunity is not  the  heritage  of  just  a  few,  but  the
birthright and the reality of all. Ke a leboga. [I thank you.] [Applause.]

[Rev J O TSELAPEDI (North West): Deputy Chairperson of the NCOP and  members
of  this  legislature  present  here,  we  as  the   North   West   province
legislature, on this issue of pushing back the frontiers of  poverty,  found
that everything in the ruling party and its strategies  is  fine.  We  found
that the main signals of governance are fine and do not have  any  problems.
However, we had a feeling that it seemed as if services did not reach  their
intended destination. What is the problem?

We  found  that  when  the  money  was  distributed,  for  example,  in  the
department of health at the clinics, medicines were  not  available  because
of theft, thus people could access them. When the money  is  distributed  by
the department of social development, children cannot access  food,  because
people try to save money and thus deny the children food.

This has made us realise that there are people  inside  the  government  and
those who should be looked after by the government. We have asked  ourselves
what we could do as a legislature. We found that our duty as  a  legislature
is to introduce and to improve the manner in which our  department  of  arts
is fulfilling what we have promised the people.

We found that our committees in our legislature should go out to  people  to
ensure that the things that are happening there are those that  people  have
been promised, and to listen to their views.

There will be a need for three things. Firstly, it  should  be  investigated
whether, when departments take money from us and say that they are going  to
do a particular thing, that is happening or not. Secondly, we found that  it
is important to use what is called public hearings to find  out  whether  in
fact the laws that we make as our plans do reach people  in  order  to  help
them. Thirdly, we found that we  should  form  parliaments  for  women,  the
youth, the elderly and the physically challenged.
In our intentions we found that they are to  our  benefit,  because  we  are
able to hear the people's views and to estimate that  we  can  really  shake
off this poverty, and push back its frontiers.

I would like to inform this House that even if we did not reach what we  had
hoped for, we are satisfied because our committees are  the  ones  directing
us and our programmes.]

We should, in the end, be able to say truly that we do attempt  to  exercise
proper oversight and monitoring. I thank you. [Applause.]

[Mr J O TLHAGALE: Hon Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  members  of  our  different
legislatures, distinguished guests present here today  and  children,  today
is an important day in the history of our province, the North West. For  the
first time in our history, Parliament has left the glamour of Cape Town  and
is sitting so far away in the North West province. We thank  the  leadership
of the NCOP, in particular  the  Chairperson  and  Deputy  Chairperson,  for
bringing Parliament to Taung.

The topic under discussion is, ``What steps can be taken by  the  Government
and other organs of state  to  eradicate  poverty  amongst  us?''  In  other
words, what can we do to eradicate poverty amongst our people?

Poverty is cruel because it takes away a person's dignity. It  doesn't  have
mercy on anyone, and  can  lead  one  to  doing  things  that  one  wouldn't
normally do. In their speeches  yesterday,  the  hon  Deputy  President  and
agriculture MEC  in  the  North  West  made  many  valid  points  about  the
importance of agriculture.

The farmers of Taung should realise  just  how  fortunate  they  are  to  be
staying in an area blessed with  water,  something  which  enables  them  to
harvest twice a year if they work hard. At  present,  many  farmers  in  the
North West could lose their crops if it doesn't rain  by  the  end  of  this
week. This means that the farmers from Taung should stand up, work hard  and
count their blessings because their luck might not last.

The local markets lack bacon and eggs, and  we  should  engage  in  pig  and
chicken farming to service the local markets and  at  the  same  time  fight
poverty, so that our families can have something to eat.

In this area of Taung there is a huge dam with lots  of  water.  It  is  not
necessary to know when it was built. The question of who  built  it  is  not
important. What is important  is  that  it  was  built  with  taxpayers'  or
Government's money. If it was indeed built with taxpayers'  or  Government's
money, as seems to be the case, then the community  should  enjoy  the  full
benefits of  that  dam's  water.  The  dam's  water  should  accordingly  be
purified and piped to the  areas  east  of  Taung,  areas  such  as  Manthe,
Molelema and other adjacent villages.

If we could use the people employed by the relevant department  to  lay  the
water pipes, more jobs would be created in the long  term,  and  that  could
help in the eradication of poverty.

The North West's budget, which  was  approved  recently,  is  sound.  Enough
funds have been allocated to various projects that have some bearing on  the
lives of our people. If those  funds  could  be  used  well,  some  of  this
poverty could be eradicated. [Time expired.] [Applause.]]

Mr A F MAHLALELA (Mpumalanga): Mr Deputy Chairperson, hon  members,  pushing
back the frontiers of poverty will  require  a  united  action  by  all  the
masses of our people. All sectors of our society  and  structures,  be  they
government, business, labour, civil society organisations  or  ourselves  as
lawmakers, should make a collective effort to fight poverty.

Government has, in the  past  nine  years,  taken  various  steps  to  fight
against poverty and protect the poor. Various policies have  been  developed
and are now in the process of  being  implemented.  All  of  these  policies
focus on the provision of a better life for all.

One of the critical policy directions is in the Constitution  itself,  which
introduced a transformative Bill of Rights which is based on human  dignity,
equality and freedom. This is absolutely central if  we  are  to  shift  the
ground and free ourselves from the  legacy  of  apartheid  colonialism.  Our
Bill of Rights is unique in the manner in which it seeks to bring about  the
transformation of our society, not only in  terms  of  civil  and  political
entitlements, but also in terms of social and economic  entitlement  through
the entrenchment of social and economic rights.

It is our duty and responsibility as public  representatives  to  make  sure
that these social and economic rights are used to the benefit  of  the  poor
in terms of the provision of land, houses, water,  medical  care,  etc.  The
land reform programme, which moves from the premise of  being  rights-based,
is critical in pushing back the frontiers  of  poverty.  This  includes  the
Restitution of Land Rights Act, the Land Reform (Labour  Tenants)  Act,  the
Interim Protection  of  Informal  Land  Rights  Act  and  the  Extension  of
Security of Tenure  Act,  as  well  as  the  Communal  Land  Bill  that  the
President, Comrade Thabo Mbeki, referred to  in  his  state  of  the  nation
address when he opened Parliament, saying that  we  need  to  finalise  this
Bill this year. We need to monitor, as members,  the  impact  of  all  these
laws in improving the quality of the lives of our people.

I am, however, convinced that the passage of the  Communal  Land  Bill  will
have a positive impact on the lives of the people  living  in  rural  areas,
especially women. For the first time, once this Bill becomes law,  women  in
the rural areas will have a right to own  land  and  be  in  a  position  to
optimally  use  that  land  to  eradicate  poverty  and  create  wealth  for
themselves. We need, however, to  call  upon  white  commercial  farmers  as
well, to be encouraged to make land available voluntarily so that we are  in
a position to expand the access to land for  agricultural  purposes  to  the
majority of the people of our country.

The Reconstruction and Development Programme is, at its  core,  a  programme
for the eradication of poverty. It remains the critical tool that should  be
used to realise the objectives  of  a  better  life  for  all.  One  of  the
programmes of the RDP is the public works programme. In  his  state  of  the
nation  address  when  he  opened  Parliament,   the   President   indicated
Government's intention to launch an expanded public  works  programme  as  a
strategic tool that would be used aggressively to fight against poverty  and
underdevelopment, creating  jobs,  building  infrastructure  and  developing
human resources through training.

The  objective  of  this  expanded  public  works  programme  is  to  create
employment  for  the  poor  through  integrated  and  co-ordinated   labour-
intensive programmes. The huge socioeconomic challenges  confronted  by  our
country, such as the  infrastructure  backlog  and  job  shortages,  can  be
handled more effectively and efficiently through  a  large-scale,  centrally
co-ordinated, but locally planned and implemented, public  works  programme.
But that will require civil servants who are community development  workers,
so that they are in a position  to  be  in  touch  with  and  work  for  the
interests of the masses of our people.

The Government has managed over the past years to cut down  taxes  for  low-
income earners and  will  continue  to  do  so.  We  should  also  therefore
encourage our people to save so that they are in a  position  to  accumulate
wealth.

The other most important critical  elements  are  the  implementation  of  a
comprehensive social security system and the introduction of the free  basic
services  to  poor  households,  as  well  as  the  R1,2  billion  that  the
Government has just announced for food  security  over  a  period  of  three
years. What we need to do is clearly  indicated  in  the  Budget  Review  of
2002, which says, among other things:


  Sustainable growth and development are necessary to achieve a progressive
  reduction in poverty and a bridging of the gap  between  rich  and  poor.
  Growth depends crucially on the maintenance of a sound macroeconomic  and
  fiscal stance, and improved investment in human development and  physical
  infrastructure.


  Growth and poverty reduction are promoted through enhanced  partnerships,
  with civil society and the  private  sector,  and  with  continental  and
  international  partners  within  the  framework  set  out  in   the   New
  Partnership for Africa's Development.


  Over the next three years, fiscal policy will support these objectives by
  increasing the resources available for programmes that contribute towards
  poverty alleviation, skills development, infrastructure expansion and job
  creation,  while  strengthening  Government's  capacity   to   lead   the
  development process.

Civil society at  all  levels  will  also  be  mobilised  for  developmental
purposes. [Time expired.] [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Hon Deputy Chair, I stand here on  behalf  of
one sector ... [Laughter.] A second  of  my  time  has  been  taken,  Deputy
Chair, so take note of that. [Interjections.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  You  are  protected.
Continue, hon member.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: It is the sector  that  bears  the  brunt  of
poverty and the burden of disease the most and that suffers  when  there  is
armed conflict and war - that is, us.

When you talk about poverty, with us - that is, women - it  is  the  way  we
look and the way we live. As you pass rivers you see us carrying buckets  of
water. When you look at the forest you see us coming out of there,  carrying
wood. That is how we live as women.

The poverty I am talking about is two-dimensional, that  is  income  poverty
and human poverty. The reality is that millions  of  us  cannot  afford  the
minimum daily calorie  intake  which  is  needed  as  a  basic  issue.  Life
expectancy is falling - the age. Maternal and mortality rates are rising.

Bomme ba shwa, ha ba ilo pepa ... [Women die in childbirth.]

... and giving birth is a natural  thing.  HIV-Aids  impacts  on  the  poor,
particularly us, women. That is how we live. I think as the  first  measure,
poverty  reduction  strategies  must  be  permanent  in   our   agendas   as
Government, the private sector or any other sector, as  the  ANC  Government
has done. Our President has established strategic  planning,  eg  the  nodal
points, such as the area of Thabo Mofutsanyane in my province, which is  the
poorest,  and  the  Kgalakgadi  area  in  this  province,  where  integrated
developmental planning is taking place.

Anyhow, these measures cannot be implemented and really  succeed  if  we  do
not have  a  democratic  environment,  that  is  a  consolidated  and  well-
maintained democracy where there  is  peace,  security  and  stability.  Our
Government and leaders in the ANC have noted that to ensure  that  there  is
peace within us, there has to be peace around us, because  if  there  is  no
peace on our borders we are not sure that there will be peace  and  security
as such. Development will also be affected.

When you speak of the development integration approach, I think you need  to
take  into  account  gender  and  disability,  two  major   issues   to   be
mainstreamed. I think our Government has really taken note of  what  we  are
saying, that gender and disability cannot be separated from the  mainstream.
They have got to be in the mainstream in every  sector  of  society  and  in
every programme.

Furthermore, we have always said that we need to have a paradigm shift  when
we think of development and move away from terminologies  such  as  welfare,
but rather talk of social development, as this Government is doing.

During  our  first  Parliament  we   signed   international   treaties   and
conventions, for example the Convention on the Elimination of all  Forms  of
Discrimination against Women as well as the Universal Declaration  on  Human
Rights. These were measures to ensure that we are  going  to  do  away  with
poverty, particularly in so far as women are concerned.

Soon after Beijing the women of this country gave us a mandate that  out  of
the 12 critical areas we had identified in Beijing, we needed to  deal  with
six to ensure that we were freeing women from poverty. One  of  these  areas
was the economic empowerment of women.

The Department of Trade and Industry has  a  women's  forum,  The  SA  Women
Entrepreneurs'   Network,   or   Sawen,   where   women   discuss   poverty,
unemployment, representation  in  industries  and  corporates,  and  how  to
access international markets. Public Works is  spending  an  amount  of  R30
million on a project which was launched on 9 August 2001.

The Department of Minerals and Energy now has women in mining  forums.  With
regard to agriculture, all provinces are moving  away  from  the  assumption
that the only way for women to farm is subsistence farming -  the  MEC  told
us yesterday. Thus we are ensuring food security.

I now come to decision-making and politics.  Quite  a  number  of  political
organisations are trying, but ours, the ANC, has actually taken the lead  by
stating that there has to be a minimum quota of 30%  in  the  representation
of women in decision-making and politics. Anyway, as women we are saying  it
should be 50% by next year. [Applause.] It has  to  be  50%,  in  accordance
with the demographics of this country.

I think all of us have accepted the affirmative  action  policy.  Women  are
networking - professionals, politicians  and  women  parliamentarians  -  in
order to get experience outside the region as well as internationally.

Concerning institutional mechanisms for  women  in  Parliament,  we  set  up
national machinery, such as the Commission on  Gender  Equality,  which  has
offices in four provinces, and the Office on  the  Status  of  Women,  which
also has offices in eight provinces. We committed  ourselves  as  Parliament
to having a committee which will monitor all these critical areas.  As  this
committee, on which I serve, we are trying our best.

A women's budget initiative has been started, and I  would  like  to  advise
the hon members in this House to read the first budget initiative report  of
1996. We need to look into this.

Then there is the issue of the  protection  of  women's  human  rights.  Mrs
Pandor yesterday elaborated on how this  Government  has  developed  gender-
sensitive legal reforms and  mentioned,  as  examples,  the  customary  law,
access to land, etc.

I now come to the  recognition  of  women's  reproductive  rights.  We  have
legislation, the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, which ensures  that
as a woman you'll have a child if you want it. If don't want to, you won't.

We have, as this Government, signed  protocols  on  married  women  who  are
foreigners and are here in South Africa to  ensure  that  their  rights  are
also entrenched, and we have made it a point that women's  rights  are  part
of the agenda of human rights and not separate.

I now come to capacity-building and  training.  We  have  made  partnerships
with a lot of NGOs that specialise in teaching  our  women  gender  analysis
skills, advocacy and gender-budgeting.

With regard to women and health, we have set guiding policies  on  HIV-Aids.
We have formed partnerships with women's health projects and networked  with
other organisations. And we have made  it  a  point  that  women  do  access
health services. As early as 1995 we started clinic-building programmes  and
small district hospitals in order for women to go to clinics. We  also  made
it a point that children under the age of five and pregnant women  had  free
health services to ensure that women's health was high on our agenda.

Anyhow, the success of all this  will  depend  on  a  changed  international
economic order. We alone as South Africa, fighting for  the  empowerment  of
women with regard to issues of poverty, cannot succeed. But  our  Government
is  trying  its  level  best  and  we  participate  in   all   international
organisations. In every delegation - if you notice - whether  to  the  World
Trade Organisation or to the IMF, the ANC-led Government insists that if  it
is possible, there must be women participants in it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J  Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  member,
your speaking time has expired. ... [Applause.]

That was a very strong message for men. I'm sure you heard  it.  Fifty  plus
fifty makes 100%. [Laughter.] I would like to advise men to  pull  up  their
socks. It is a very big challenge.

Nkk J N VILAKAZI: Mphathisihlalo  ohloniphekileyo,  Sihlalo  ohloniphekileyo
womKhandlu  kaZwelonke  weziFundazwe  Nkk  G  N  Pandor  kanye  nabo   bonke
obambisene nabo, amalungu ePhalamende akhona  phakathi  kwethu,  amakhansela
endawo akhona phakathi kwethu, amakhosi, izikhulu zeminyango  ehlukahlukene,
umphakathi    wonke    waseTaung,    amadodana     namadodakazi     e-Afrika
ngiyanibingelela nonke egameni leNkatha Freedom Party.

Angiphinde  futhi  ngibonge  iNdlu  yoMkhandlu  kaZwelonke   esihlalo   sayo
kunguNkk G N  Pandor  kanye  nabo  bonke  abambisene  nabo  kulo  mbhidlango
wokuletha   iPhalamende   kubantu.   Kuyisinyathelo   esikhulu   kabi   lesi
nesibalulekile ekuxosheni indlala.

Ukuhambela izifundazwe  ngale  ndlela  kusinika  umdlandla  namandla  okwazi
esikhuluma ngakho. Imithetho  izoshaywa  sesixhumene  nabantu  emiphakathini
yabo, sesizwile  abakushoyo  okuyizinkinga  zabo.  Lokhu  kuzosiza  abashaya
umthetho  ukuthi  bashaye  umthetho   ozoqondana   nqgo   nesimo   nesidingo
somphakathi.

Imali  izokhishwa  ePhalamende  elikhulu  ilingane  ncamashi  nesimo   leso.
Sekulula kabi lokho ukuthi iPhalamende likulandele, libone ukuthi  kuyenzeka
yini njengoba umthetho ushayiwe ngezidingo,  imali  ikhishiwe  yini,  ikhona
yini inqubekela phambili, imali igcineke kahle  yini,  ayehlanga  ngemilenze
nokunye nokunye. Lokhu sikubiza phecelezi, nge ``oversight role''.

Kafushane  nje  mphakathi  ohloniphekileyo,  sekukhulunywe  kakhulu  ngalesi
sihloko.   Umphakathi   ebesinawo   uzwile    ukuthi    kukhona    izinkinga
ezikhinyabezayo   ekuthuthukiseni   umphakathi,   kodwa   engibona    ukuthi
zingancipha ngalezi zinyathelo engizozibala  ukufaka  kulokhu  asebekufakile
ozakwethu.

Okokuqala,  ngukubambisana  komphakathi  ekwenzeni  izinto   okusho   ukuthi
``united we stand but divided  we  fall''  [sonqoba  simunye].  Kuwumsebenzi
walowo nalowo muntu, walowo nalowo mphakathi ukwenza izinto  ngokubambisana,
nibeke  eceleni  ubuqembu  ngoba  buvamise   ukona   kwinqubekela   phambili
nentuthuko yomphakathi.

Bambisanani,   sebenzani   ndawonye   nenzele   intuthuko,   nesizwe   sonke
siyothuthuka ngani, sidumise uMdali  ndawonye  njengoba  senza  emasontweni.
Emasontweni  siyaya  khona,  ngiyiLuthela  mina,  omunye  uyiSheshi,  omunye
yiRoma kanjalo  kanjalo,  asixabani.  Pho  manje  sixatshaniswa  yini  lapha
kwezobuqembu?  UHulumeni  wethu  uyabasiza  abantu  abasungula   imisebenzi.
Umsebenzi eniwuqalayo nindawonye awube yisidingo endaweni.  Mawukwazi  futhi
ukuvula amathuba emisebenzi, ukwazi ukukhula usimame wondle, ungashabalali.

Okwesibili, ukugunyaza omama ukuvula  imisebenzi  ezokulwa  nendlala.  Omama
yibona abondla imindeni ikakhulu.  Obaba  bayondla,  hhayi  ukuthi  abondli,
kodwa omama imvamisa yibona  nogogo abondlayo.

Ngakho-ke  siyadinga  ukulekelelana   nokubambisana.   Ukubambisana   kwethu
makuqale ekhaya la sihlezi khona  emndenini.  Ukusebenzisana  kumele  kuqale
ekhaya.

Siyazazi  izinto  ezikhubaza  ukuthola  umxhaso  kaHulumeni.  Imvamisa  kuba
yinkinga nje encane. Kuye kuthi sebehlangene abantu  benalo  ikhono,  uthole
ukuthi  abakwazi  ukwenza  uhlelo  lwebhizinisi,  ikakhulu  emakhaya,   bese
bekhinyabezeka njalo.  Siyacela  kuHulumeni  wethu  sengathi  kungaba  khona
abantu ababekwayo, abazobonisa  kahle  abantu  babalekelele  ukuthi  bathole
indlela  elula  yokuxhaswa  uma  kubonakala  ukuthi   umsebenzi   abawenzayo
uyabonakala futhi bahlangene, kanye nokunye.

Kukhona nama-social grants ukusiza ogogo  nomama  abondla  abantwana.  Konke
lokho abakwazi  omama.  Kukhona  abangazi  nanokuthi  yini  i-social  grant,
baswele  umuntu  ozobatshela.  [Ihlombe]  (Translation  of  isiZulu   speech

[Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Hon Chairperson, hon Chairperson of the NCOP Mrs  G  N  M
Pandor and everybody in your team, members of Parliament who are  here  with
us,  local  councils  who  are  also  here  with  us,  traditional  leaders,
dignitaries from different departments, the whole community of  Taung,  sons
and daughters of Africa, I greet you all in the name of the Inkatha  Freedom
Party.

Again, let me thank the National Council of Provinces, whose Chairperson  is
Mrs G N M Pandor, and everybody she is working  with  in  this  business  of
bringing Parliament closer to the people. This is  a  major  step  which  is
very important in boosting the food-relief programme.

To visit provinces in this way gives us the  energy  and  drive  of  knowing
what it is that we are talking  about.  Laws  will  be  made  when  we  have
communicated with the people in their respective communities, when  we  have
also heard what they say their problems are. This will help those  who  make
laws so that they make laws that will be compatible with the  situation  and
the needs of the community.

The money will come from the national Parliament and the amounts will  match
each particular situation. It is now very easy for Parliament to  follow  up
on that, to see whether things are happening  in  accordance  with  the  law
that has been made relating to the needs, that  the  money  has  been  given
out, whether there is any progress, whether the money is  well-looked  after
and not  being misused, etc. This is what we  call  an  oversight  role.  In
short, a lot has been said on this  topic.  The  community  we  belonged  to
before  understood  that  there  are   problems   that   disrupt   community
development, which I believe could be minimised  with  these  steps  that  I
will be mentioning, just to add to what my colleagues have already said.

First of all, it is about working closely with  the  community  when  we  do
things. United we stand, but divided we fall. It is  the  responsibility  of
each individual and each community to do things collectively and  put  aside
party politics, because it often spoils community progress and development.

Work together collectively for  the  sake  of  development,  and  the  whole
country will develop because of you, and we will all  glorify  God  together
as we do in church. We all go to church. I am Lutheran,  one  is  Church  of
God, the other is Roman Catholic, etc, and we are not in  conflict.  So  why
are we in confrontation with one another when it comes to party politics?
The Government assists people who start businesses. The  business  that  you
start together must be a necessity in the community - it  must  be  able  to
create job opportunities, to grow and be sustainable.

Secondly,  it  is  to  empower  women  to  create  jobs  that  will   combat
starvation. Women are the ones who nurture families. Men also  do  -  it  is
not that they don't, but more often it  is  the  women  and  elderly  women.
Therefore we need to help one another and work  together.  Working  together
must begin at home where we live as families.

We know the things that retard Government's  assistance.  Usually  it  is  a
just small hiccup. When people come together  and  they  have  a  particular
skill, then you find that they have no idea how to make a  business  plan  -
in the rural areas in  particular  -  and  consequently  their  progress  is
retarded.

We would like to ask our Government if it cannot nominate  people  who  will
guide people to be able to get help so that they have an easy way to  access
Government's assistance if the work that they are doing is  substantial  and
if they work co-operatively, etc.
There are also social grants to assist  grandmothers  and  mothers  to  feed
their children. Mothers do not know all that. There  are  some  who  do  not
even know  what  a  social  grant  is;  they  have  no  one  to  tell  them.
[Applause.]]

Mr R M NYAKANE: Chair, the Taung farming  community  have  ventilated  their
concerns and frustrations on matters  pertaining  to,  among  other  things,
farming. They depicted problems such as a lack of  know-how,  resources  and
capacity. The questions did not merely stem from these premises, but  rather
were orchestrated by an abject  poverty  situation  these  emerging  farmers
found themselves in. The MEC and  others  have  diligently  addressed  their
problems.

However, the Deputy  Chairperson  stood  up  yesterday  here  to  officially
recognise the presence of white farmers who were seated right in the  corner
there. We were indeed blessed to have in our midst  white  farmers  who  are
known to have experience in farming  activities.  They  are  known  to  have
extensively interacted with  financial  institutions,  creditors,  marketing
institutions, mechanisation, even disaster management, yet they chose to  be
silent throughout  the  discussions  yesterday.  Behaviour  of  this  nature
leaves one with doubt as to whether one has got an  honest  partner  who  is
equally committed to the cause of driving back the frontiers of poverty.

I picked up from one young lady here yesterday that if  you  empower  women,
you empower the nation. If you empower men, you  empower  individuals.  This
argument implies, therefore, that if you give  wealth  to  women,  you  give
wealth to the nation and  as  such  push  back  the  frontiers  of  poverty.
[Applause.]

Hon MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

Mr R M NYAKANE: How can one access and harness a  mould  that  would  create
wealth? Work, or rather employment, is, among  other  things,  an  effective
tool for the creation of wealth. Wealth can be created by people  who  work,
because employment leads to wealth creation. Wealth in itself leads  to  the
solution of social problems that are at present besetting our society,  such
as poverty, HIV/Aids, you name it. I have already intimated that  employment
leads to the creation of wealth.

The  question  of  land  features  equally  important  in  terms  of  wealth
creation. The Bapedi adage goes: Lehumo le tswa tshemong. [All wealth  comes
from the land.] The accessibility of land  becomes,  therefore,  a  critical
issue. By the by, are we adequately equipped to drive back the frontiers  of
poverty, given the situation in which 80% of the historically  disadvantaged
persons can only access less than 20% of the land  in  this  country,  while
only 20%  of  the  historically  advantaged  persons,  in  this  case  white
farmers, access 80% of  the  fertile  land?  Opposed  to  this,  blacks  are
sandwiched in the townships where each individual household can only  access
a 150 m2 piece of land.

We promulgate laws in Parliament with good intentions and good  vision.  The
problems arise at  the  implementation  stage.  You'll  recall  what  ensued
subsequent to the passage of the land and agricultural amending  legislation
and the labour legislation. The intention of those laws were to protect  the
interests and rights of the farmworkers and domestic workers. What  happened
is that most of the farmers started to retrench workers.

I remember in Mpumalanga we had a case in which an old lady had worked in  a
white man's kitchen for 30 years and when  this  particular  law  came  into
effect that woman started "stinking" in the  kitchen,  and  the  baas  said:
"Nee, sy stink. Sy moet nou sommer bedank, haar man vat  en  wegloop."  [No,
she stinks. She should resign, take her husband  and  go.]  [Interjections.]
This was a case which was argued in the media.  Some  of  us  could  perhaps
have come across this particular case.

I'm from the Lowveld where we have one of the giant potato producers in  the
person of Bertie van Zyl ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu):  Order!  Hon  Nyakane,
your time has expired, Sir.

Mr R M NYAKANE: ... who has retrenched almost half of the 2 000  people  who
worked for him, because of these laws that were passed.  Thank  you.  Sorry!
[Applause.]

Rev P MOATSHE: Chairperson and hon members, the DP will have to go  back  to
school to learn the politics of Africa. It is therefore  imperative  for  me
to hint at a few points that  were  made  by  the  hon  member  Sono.  As  a
legislator, Sono of the DP ought to know the law. The marketing at  stadiums
was managed by the United Cricket Board, which  controls  the  marketing  at
its stadiums. We are rather surprised that she as a proponent  of  the  free
market system and free enterprise, does not know  that  the  United  Cricket
Board is not Government.

My second response is that it is untrue that more than 60% of our Budget  is
used to pay civil servants. There are huge amounts spent  on  infrastructure
such as roads, water and forestry. I suggest that she  look  at  the  Budget
more closely. Maybe she should be given  a  magnifying  glass  so  that  she
understands it better. What has actually happened is  that  the  expenditure
on civil servants has been reduced by more than 15% - in many instances,  as
a result of rightsizing.

Mmusakgotla, kana moja-morago ke kgosi. [Perseverance breeds success.]

The 21 century is the African century. It is dedicated to  Africa.  All  the
nations of  the  world  are  aware  of  this  fact.  The  prophecy  and  the
authenticity of this thought emanates within  South  Africa.  Therefore  our
leaders and I want members to listen very attentively, as  it  is  extremely
important. [Interjections.]

Bagaetsho, re tshegofaditswe.  Aforika  e  tshegofaditswe.  Re  motlotlo  go
bidiwa Ma-Aforika, segolo-bogolo go bidiwa  Ma-Aforika  Borwa.  [Countrymen,
we have been blessed. Africa has been blessed. We are  proud  to  be  called
Africans, more especially South Africans.]

We are most privileged. We men  and  women  of  stature,  respectable,  with
dignity, men with foresight and a vision of the future.

If we want to push back the frontiers of poverty,  we  must  understand  the
politics of South Africa, because that is God's calling. God has called  men
and women in this part of the continent  and  this  part  of  the  world  to
become prophets of the future. The changing of the  globe  will  start  from
South Africa.

Magora go ša a a mabapi. Ke se se  bolelwang  ke  Mopresidente  wa  naga  ya
rona. Ba DP fa ba ntse ba fofafofa, ba iphatlha ka  diphuka,  magora  go  ša

Bagaetsho, re na le batho ba ba tlhalefileng. Mongwe wa bona ke  Mme  Naledi
Pandor, yo o tsamaisang Ntlo e. Re na le motho  yo  o  nang  le  ponelopele.

Ke gore o tsalwa o le moeteledipele yo a nonofileng, yo o  kgonang  go  bona
le go etela morafe pele. (Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[People should help one another. This is what our  country's  President  has
been saying. While members of the DP go around  stumbling  over  themselves,
it remains a fact that people should help one another. [Applause.]

Countrymen, we have among us very wise people. One  of  them  is  Ms  Naledi
Pandor, the Chairperson of this House. In her we have somebody with  vision.
You cannot study vision at university. It is a gift from God.  You  have  to
be born a true leader to be able to lead a nation.]

I have a dream and you have a dream, that one day the frontiers of  poverty,
one day the scourge of HIV/Aids, will be pushed to the  periphery.  One  day
we shall be happy in this country, in  this  continent  and  in  the  entire
world.

Baetsho, go ntse jalo, ke ka lebaka leo re lemogang gore  fa  re  kgarametsa

Ke ka lobaka leo go leng botlhokwa gore baagi ba Taung ba kgone go  bala  mo

(Translation of Setswana paragraphs follows.)

[Countrymen, it is for that reason that we become blind when  we  push  back
the frontiers of poverty in South Africa. The President of our country  says
that we should push back the frontiers of poverty in the  whole  of  Africa.
People should share the little that they have. The whole  of  Africa  should
come together united to push this process forward.

It is for that reason that it is very important for the people of  Taung  to
read between the lines and realise that we have been blessed  with  a  gift,
and they should use it wisely. We should really put that gift  to  good  use
to ensure that poverty is in trouble;  poverty  is  attacked  by  those  who
understand it.]

One day we shall be competing with other nations of the world,  economically
and otherwise. Tony Blair, George Bush - what's wrong with you?  [Applause.]
Where is Nelson Mandela, the prophet, a man who emerged from Robben  Island,
who was suppressed, but a man with  foresight  and  vision  for  the  entire
world? He calls them to order because when  we  say  we  want  to  push  the
frontiers of poverty away, Bush and Blair say, "We  push  the  frontiers  of
poverty back into Africa, into the nations of the world."  That's  why  they
are opting for war; blind people with no vision.

Fela Motswana a re, ``Nonyane e e mephophoto-megolo e  iphatlha  ka  diphuka
tsa yona.'' Tony Blair le George Bush ba tlile go iphatlha  ka  diphuka  tsa
bona. [The Motswana of yesteryear said that ``a person who plays  with  fire
ends up burning himself''. [Applause.] Tony Blair and George Bush are  going
to burn themselves.]

This is the African century, the  21st  century.  The  power  of  the  world
emerges from South Africa. We have men and women of dignity, men  and  women
of stature. We must be inspired to see, to understand and to hear  the  wind
that is blowing ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Thank you, hon Moatshe.

Rev P MOATSHE: ... that we shall overcome one day.
[Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! I am  sure  that  all  that  is
left now is to see the Reverend on the pulpit. [Laughter.]

Debate concluded.

        LOCAL GOVERNMENT: MUNICIPAL STRUCTURES SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

      (Consideration of Bill and of Report of Select Committee on Local
                   Government and Administration thereon)

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Order! Hon members, I wish  to  inform
you that copies of the report of the Select Committee  on  Local  Government
and Administration have been distributed to all members in  the  House,  and
therefore we will go according to the list.

Seeing that we do not have with us the hon Deputy  Minister  for  Provincial
and Local Government, we will then call upon the hon Mr  Mkhaliphi,  who  is
the  chairperson  of  the  Select  Committee   on   Local   Government   and
Administration.

Mr B  J  MKHALIPHI:  Hon  Deputy  Chairperson,  hon  special  and  permanent
delegates, ladies and gentlemen, the Local Government: Municipal  Structures
Second Amendment Bill in front of us this morning is  one  of  a  series  of
amendments that seek to clarify certain issues in  our  evolving  system  of
local governance by clarifying extensively the steps and actions  that  need
to be taken in the event of a change of a system in a municipality. It  also
stipulates specific timeframes within which these actions and  steps  should
be taken and by whom.

We are aware that  the  determination  of  a  system  to  be  adopted  by  a
municipality should take place through the  office  of  the  MEC  for  local
government in a province by  way  of  a  section  12  notice.  Although  the
amendment of a section 12 notice was provided  for  in  section  16  of  the
principal Act, it did  not  clarify  when  this  change  could  occur,  thus
resulting in a litany of interpretations. This uncertainty is  clarified  in
clause 4 of this Bill. Of course,  other  members  of  this  committee  will
elaborate in this regard.

Generally when considering any amendment to a piece of  legislation,  it  is
crucial for us as lawmakers to reflect  on  whether  such  an  amendment  is
still within the letter and spirit of the original legislation.  We  applied
our minds when we considered this  Bill  at  the  committee  level.  We  are
therefore satisfied that the passing of  this  Bill  is  in  line  with  the
transformation measures embedded in our  system  of  local  government.  Our
major safeguard against abuse of the system remains sections 12  and  16  of
the Local Government: Municipal Structures Act, in that any  change  of  the
type of a municipality  cannot  take  place  without  consultation  and  the
consent of the MEC for local government of a province.

On behalf of the Select Committee on Local Government and Administration,  I
wish to  express  our  appreciation  for  the  broad  participation  by  our
provinces in the deliberations on this Bill during the provincial  week.  Of
course, our thanks should also go to the National Council  of  Provinces  as
an institution for allowing this Bill to be part of  the  package  that  was
deliberated on in the provinces. Indeed, hon members, ladies and  gentlemen,
we are not standing before you on wobbly legs. We  are  confident  that  the
Bill has gone through thorough scrutiny in the provinces, although it  is  a
section 75 Bill. I would therefore be surprised if there were any member  of
the committee who expressed  some  reservation  in  passing  this  piece  of
legislation. I thank you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Mnr J HORNE: Agbare Voorsitter, lede van die  wetgewer  alhier,  asook  lede
van die Huis, ek wil graag van  hierdie  geleentheid  gebruik  maak  om  die
Voorsitter, mev Pandor, asook die Adjunkvoorsitter, te bedank. Ek  dink  ons
sal in die jare wat kom die dividende in van dit  wat  vandag  hier  gebeur.
Ons sal vir u gee:

  Die leiers op die hoogste trap het nie gestyg met  'n  enkele  stap.  Wyl
  ander slaap en droom, het hul gewerk tot oggendstond.

Die wetsontwerp voor ons gaan hoofsaaklik oor die wysiging van  die  Wet  op
Plaaslike Regering: Munisipale Strukture, Wet No 117  van  1998,  ten  einde
die uitwerking van  'n  verandering  in  die  soort  munisipaliteit  op  die
ampstermyne  van  lede  van  die   uitvoerende   komitees   en   uitvoerende
burgemeesters te reël en om  voorsiening  te  maak  vir  aangeleenthede  wat
daarmee in verband staan.

Oorspronklik is waarskynlik voorsien  dat  metropolitaanse  en  ander  groot
munisipaliteite  die  uitvoerende   burgermeesterstelsel   sou   kies,   die
middelslagmunisipaliteite  die  uitvoerende  komiteestelsel  en   die   heel
kleintjies die stelsel van 'n uitvoerende volle raad, en dat  in  die  hoogs
uitsonderlike geval van 'n behoefte aan 'n verandering  van  die  soort  van
munisipaliteit, dit gedoen sal word sonder hindernis, volgens die  prosedure
voorgeskryf in artikel 16 van die  Wet  op  Plaaslike  Regering:  Munisipale
Strukture, Wet No 117 van 1998.

Die praktyk het egter getoon dat ander faktore as bloot die grootte  van  'n
munisipaliteit 'n rol speel in die keuse van 'n soort munisipaliteit en  dat
daar dus 'n groot behoefte aan verandering is,  maar  dat  bepaalde  wetlike
hindernisse bestaan om sekere soorte te verander.

Aangesien hierdie wetsontwerp nou al  hierdie  onvoorsiene  hindernisse  vir
veranderings wegneem, en  tegelykertyd  onduidelikhede  in  hierdie  verband
opklaar, sal die Nuwe NP graag wil sien dat  elke  munisipale  raad  homself
afvra of hulle, in die lig van meer as twee jaar se ondervinding, die  regte
soort munisipaliteit het en, indien nie, hulle hul LUR sal nader. Waar  daar
besluit word op die tipe munisipaliteit van uitvoerende  burgemeester,  voel
die Nuwe NP baie sterk daaroor dat die  uitvoerende  burgemeesterkomitee  se
vergaderings nie agter geslote deure moet plaasvind nie. Dit is verkeerd  om
uitvoerende burgemeesterkomiteevergaderings met  die  nasionale  Kabinet  te
vergelyk en dit te gebruik as verskoning om agter geslote deure te  ontmoet.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: Hon Chairperson, members of the legislature here,  as  well  as
the members of the House, I would like to take  this  opportunity  to  thank
the Chairperson, Mrs Pandor, as well as the Deputy Chairperson. I  think  we
will reap the dividends of that which is happening here today in  the  years
to come. We will give you the following: The leaders  on  the  highest  rung
did not rise with one step. While others slept and dreamt, they worked  till
early morning.
The Bill  before  us  deals  primarily  with  the  amendment  of  the  Local
Government: Municipal Structures Act, Act  No  117  of  1998,  in  order  to
regulate the effect of a change in the type of municipality on the terms  of
office of members of the executive committees and executive  mayors  and  to
make provision for matters associated herewith.

Originally, it was probably envisaged  that  metropolitan  and  other  large
municipalities would choose the executive mayor  system,  that  medium-sized
municipalities would choose the executive  committee  system  and  that  the
very small ones would choose the full council executive system, and that  in
the highly exceptional cases  of  a  need  for  a  change  in  the  type  of
municipality, this would  be  done  without  impediment,  in  terms  of  the
procedure prescribed in  section  16  of  the  Local  Government:  Municipal
Structures Act, Act No 117 of 1998.

However, practice showed that factors  other  than  merely  the  size  of  a
municipality play a role in the choice of a type of  municipality  and  that
there is therefore a great need  for  change,  but  that  certain  statutory
obstacles exist to change certain types.

Seeing that this Bill now removes all these unforeseen obstacles and at  the
same time clears up issues that are unclear  in  this  regard,  the  New  NP
would like to see each municipal council asking itself whether they, in  the
light  of  more  than  two  years'  experience,  have  the  right  type   of
municipality and, if not, approaching their MEC. Where  an  executive  mayor
type of municipality is decided upon, the New NP feels  very  strongly  that
the executive mayoral  committee  meetings  should  not  take  place  behind
closed doors. It is wrong to compare executive  mayoral  committee  meetings
with the national Cabinet and to use  this  as  an  excuse  to  meet  behind
closed doors.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  Sorry,  hon  member.  The  Table  has
indicated that there is a problem with the interpreters. If  that  could  be
attended to, please.

Rev M CHABAKU: Hon Chairperson, I think it would also be helpful if the  hon
member  actually  talked  slowly  so  that  the  interpreters  are  able  to
comprehend what he is saying and then translate. If he  reads  fast,  it  is
not easy to translate fast.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Continue, hon member, please.

Mnr J HORNE: Die praktyk het egter getoon dat ander  faktore  as  bloot  die
grootte van die munisipaliteit 'n rol speel by die keuse van soorte  en  dat
daar dus 'n groter behoefte aan verandering is. Waar daar  besluit  word  op
die tipe munisipaliteit van uitvoerende burgemeester, voel die Nuwe NP  baie
sterk daaroor  dat  uitvoerende  burgemeesterkomiteevergaderings  nie  agter
geslote deure  moet  plaasvind  nie.  (Translation  of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[Mr J HORNE: However, practice has shown that factors other than merely  the
size of the municipality play a role in the choice of type  and  that  there
is thus a greater need  for  change.  Where  the  executive  mayor  type  of
municipality is decided upon, the New NP feels very strongly that  executive
mayoral committee meetings should not take place behind closed doors.]

In the Western Cape, where we govern with the  ANC,  we  have  secured  this
commitment.  It  is  unfortunate  that  the  practice  has  developed   that
executive mayoral committees meet behind closed doors.

Ten slotte, soos reeds  vroeër  genoem,  gaan  die  wetsontwerp  hoofsaaklik
daaroor om  die  ampstermyne  en  tydskale  van  lede  van  die  uitvoerende
komitees en van uitvoerende burgemeesters te reël. Aangesien daar  nou  meer
duidelikheid is oor die wet voor  ons,  ondersteun  die  Nuwe  NP  die  wet.
[Applous.] (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion, as already mentioned earlier, the Bill primarily deals  with
regulating the terms of office and time scales of members of  the  executive
committee and executive mayors. As there is now more clarity  regarding  the
Act before us, the New NP supports the legislation. [Applause.]]

Mrs E N LUBIDLA:  Deputy  Chair,  hon  members,  the  Bill  deals  with  the
changing of the type  of  executive  government  of  a  municipality  -  for
example, the change from a multiparty  collective  executive  to  a  single-
party mayoral executive.

The original Local Government: Municipal Structures Act of 1998 allowed  for
the change of one type of executive to another but did not provide  for  the
consequences of this. The current Bill deals  with  this  and  with  related
issues.

I will deal with a summary of the contents of the Bill. Firstly, section  45
of the principal Act states that a municipal council must elect the  members
of its executive committee from its own members at a meeting  that  must  be
held within 14 days after the date with effect from which the  type  of  the
municipality has changed.

Secondly, section 46 is amended to clarify the terms of office  of  members.
The members of an executive committee are elected for  a  term  ending  when
the type of municipality has changed.

Thirdly, section 48(5) states that no person  holding  office  as  mayor  or
deputy mayor may serve more than two terms respectively.

Fourthly, section 55 is amended to provide for the timeframe during which  a
municipal council must elect a mayor and, if the MEC  for  local  government
agrees, also a deputy mayor from among  its  members.  In  this  regard  the
amendment states that it must happen within 14  days  after  the  date  with
effect from which the type of municipality has been changed.

Fifthly, section 57 is amended to clarify the term of  office  of  executive
mayors. In this regard the amendment makes it clear that an executive  mayor
and the deputy mayor may not serve as executive mayor and deputy  mayor  for
more than two consecutive terms. When a person is elected to fill a  vacancy
in the office of executive mayor  or  executive  deputy  mayor,  the  period
between that election and  the  next  election  of  an  executive  mayor  or
executive deputy mayor is regarded as a term.

In  conclusion,  one  of   the   enduring   problems   of   transition   and
transformation  was  the  inability  of  newly  elected  leaders  to  assert
democratic control over local administrations. This Bill will go a long  way
towards ensuring greater accountability and that  councillors  will  act  in
the interests of the electorate. Thank you, Chair. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: I call the hon member Kgoshi  Mokoena.
[Interjections.] I'm sorry, the hon Lever, please. I'm sorry.
Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I won't take that  as  a  Freudian  slip  on  the
implementation of our democracy. [Laughter.]

Let me turn to my speech. The  proposed  amendment  clarifies  the  term  of
office for executive  committees,  executive  mayors  and  deputy  executive
mayors when there is a change of system. The  present  amendment  serves  to
clarify the results of changes which have now arisen  as  a  result  of  the
crossing-of-the-floor  legislation,  but  these  changes  have  always  been
possible with the concurrence of the MEC.

The DP has preferred the more inclusive model  of  the  executive  committee
system, but the changes that are likely to take place  now  will  be  mainly
with regard to the executive mayoral system. The  executive  mayoral  system
need not, but does, in practice,  result  in  the  exclusion  of  opposition
parties from the mayoral committee.  The  DA  has  tried  unsuccessfully  to
challenge this exclusion in court.

While the whole Local Government: Municipal Systems Act is premised  on  the
participation of the whole community in the planning  process  of  municipal
councils, in the overwhelming number of  municipal  councils  the  executive
mayoral committee operates on the exclusion of elected councillors from  the
opposition.  In  the  Johannesburg  Unicity,  opposition  parties  are  even
excluded from observer status on the mayoral executive committee.

The DA only got to know about key performance indicators  for  the  top  two
levels of management from the media. This is clearly not ideal in an  infant
democracy. Further, this exclusion ...

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Sorry, hon Lever. Hon Lucas,  are  you
rising on a point of order?

Mr G A LUCAS: Yes, Chair, I am. In this House there is no DA. We know  about
the DP. So the member should not make reference to the DA,  which  does  not
exist in this House. That is wrong, Chair.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: OK. Continue, hon member.

Mr L G LEVER: Chairperson, I'm  discussing  local  government,  and  at  the
local government level the party is the DA. So  I'm  not  referring  to  the
party in this House. I'm referring to the party at local government level.
Further, this exclusion does not in any way contribute to  transparency  and
accountability in local  government.  It  is,  in  fact,  an  impediment  to
transparency and accountability. The parlous  state  of  municipal  finances
and a regrettable lack of capacity at municipal level  would  indicate  that
all available talent should be employed to ensure proper delivery.

However, we can  support  this  amendment  on  the  grounds  that  it  makes
technical corrections to an existing  system,  but  we  would  urge  further
debate on the need for local government to be as responsive as  is  feasible
to the needs of the people. This, by definition, requires the  participation
of  all  elected  councillors  in  the  business  of   their   municipality.
Chairperson, I thank you. [Applause.]

paragraph follows.)

[Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Chairperson, Deputy and your reliable Chief  Whip,  all
has been said, except for me to explain to the  Mokwenas  and  the  Thulares
what this Bill is about in simple terms. What it  means  is  the  following:
There are two types of municipalities, the ones with an executive mayor  and
the others with an executive committee. This Bill makes it possible for  any
municipality to choose if they  want  to  have  an  executive  mayor  or  an
executive committee.]

What is the cause of that? Let's say, for example, I want  to  compare  this
Bill with a president of a country who is, for instance, bloodthirsty.

Modulasetulo, go ka tsela ye ... [This is how it is ...]

If, in a municipality, there is an executive mayor ...

A ke e beye ka segagešo gore bakgekolo kua godimo ba nkwe gabotse. Ratoropo-
konokono yo a bego a tagwa ke pušo gomme a nyaka go tšeya diphetho a  nnoši,

[Disego.] Bjale Molaokakanywa wo ka bokopana o ra gore maatla ao a  swerwego
ke mokgalabje yola kua godimo o tlo a ngwathelana le khuduthamaga  ya  gagwe
kua fase. A ke re le ya bona! (Translation of Sepedi paragraphs follows.)

[Let me make this clear so that our  senior  citizens  in  the  gallery  can
understand me well. The executive mayor who at  times  becomes  power  drunk
and takes decisions without consulting his or her committee  can  no  longer
do that, as they used to do. The executive committee, if they discover  that
their mayor is suffering from his unmanaged  and  uncontrolled  powers,  can
decide to reduce his or her powers  so  that  all  decisions  can  be  taken
through consultation with the whole committee.

It simply means he or she will never have those supreme powers that  enabled
him or her to abuse the same. Those powers will  now  rest  with  the  whole
executive committee. From now on he or she will not be able to do  that.  Am
I understood?

Now there is another thought where people are saying there are  some  mayors
who are like the president of a country who always go against the  will  and
wishes of his people. That president does what pleases him  and  his  family
and even forces people to clap hands for him. Whenever he  opens  his  mouth
it is always war talk. Am I understood? Let us say, for example,  this  Bill
is an Act in that country. He will be cut  down  to  size  so  that  he  can
behave like any normal person. [Laughter.] This Bill, in short,  means  that
those powers that were held by the said mayors will  be  curtailed.  Do  you
get what I am saying?]

There is another dimension.

Ge komiti e fetola maemo go tloga go mohuta wa  ratoropo  wa  bokhuduthamaga
go ya go mohuta wa komiti ya bokhuduthamaga, maloko ka  moka  a  felelwa  ke
maemo a go ba ditho tša khansele gomme ramotse le yena ga a sa  le  ramotse.
Dikomiti-phethiš i le tšona ga e sa le dikomiti-phethiši gomme ka moka di  a
lekana. (Translation of Sepedi paragraph follows.)

[When the committee changes its form to that of an executive committee,  all
the members of that committee, including the mayor, cease to be  members  of
the council. The executive committee and all ordinary councillors  will  all
be at the same level.]
What does that mean?

Seo se ra gore maloko ka moka a swanetše go thoma go kgethana ka boswa  gore
ratoropo e tlo ba mang magareng ga bona. Ge go kgonega, ba ka  bušetša  yena
yola ba bego ba mo kgethile peleng. Tabakgolo ke  gore  ge  ba  kgethana  ka
boswa gomme MEC a ba dumeletše gore ba ka  kgethana,  mengwaga  goba  lebaka
leo ba ba tšwago go lona ga le sa šoma. A re re dikgetho  di  bile  mengwaga
ye mebedi ya go feta gomme ba phetha ka go  fetola  morago  ga  mengwaga  ye
mebedi; ka mantšu a mangwe mengwaga ye mebedi ya go  feta  ga  e  sa  balwa,
gomme ba swanetše go  thoma  ka  boswa.  (Translation  of  Sepedi  paragraph
follows.)

That simply means all executive committee members and their  mayor  have  to
be newly appointed. They must decide amongst themselves who is going  to  be
the new mayor. Under normal circumstances they might choose to  appoint  the
same mayor again.]

In other words the mayor and the deputy mayor can stay in that position  for
only two terms. But when they change during the  last  two  years  it  means
they can serve for 12 years because the two-year term is not counted.
A di a kwagala? Ke Molaokakanywa o rego bjalo.  Efela  Mmušo  ka  go  lemoga
gore go na le batho ba go o jabetša, bomabinagosolwa, ba go ja  mo  go  sego

fetogeng gore re tle re kgone go tšwela pele. Tšeo ba  ka  se  di  kgone  ka
gore motlhomphegi Mokhuduthamaga – MEC ... (Translation of Sepedi  paragraph
follows.)

[Am I understood? That is all that this  Bill  entails.  The  Government  is
aware that there are cheaters, opportunists and those who  reap  where  they
did not sow, who, after realising that their  term  is  coming  to  an  end,
might decide to change the form and continue serving even after  their  term
has elapsed. That won't be possible because the MEC  will  have  to  approve
that particular extension.]

I don't think I'm too fast for the interpreter. I'm trying to be very slow.

Ge khansele e dira kgopelo ya go  fetola  maemo  a  yona,  Mokhuduthamaga  o

[When the Council makes a request to change their form, the  MEC  will  have
to look seriously into their requests in order to verify  if  there  are  no
ulterior motives. When he has considered all  that  and  satisfied  himself,
then he can allow the mayor to continue running  the  council.  Again,  when
they change the form to that of an executive council that will  enable  them
to assist the weak or poorly performing mayor in running the affairs of  the
council, we cannot just silence a human being? Yes, we assist in  developing
one another.

As the committee sat down, they  considered  this  Bill  and  realised  that
there  are  cross-border  municipalities.  This  issue  raised  some  havoc,
tension and a crisis, because it appeared as if the  Bill  talks  about  one
MEC when in fact it was supposed to  have  two  MECs  in  this  cross-border
municipality. For example, the Kruger Park that is controlled by  Mpumalanga
and Limpopo, Groblersdal that is controlled by Mpumalanga, and  Limpopo  and
Hartswater which are controlled by North West and the  Northern  Cape.  What
are we saying about them?
Dr Bower, who is a legal expert  in  the  justice  department  assured  this
committee that both MECs will have to agree before a decision is taken.

Let me take this opportunity to thank the audience that I  managed  to  make
them aware about what this Bill entails. I think I managed to simplify  what
this Bill is all about. I believe ...]

... the reservations and concerns raised  by  my  colleague  Lawrence  Lever
will be addressed, because I will talk to him afterwards. I don't  think  he
needs to panic because we will be working together on this Bill.

On that note ... ke leboga go menagane. [Legofsi.] [I thank  you  a  million
times. [Applause.]]

Debate concluded.

Bill agreed to in accordance with section 75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 11:59.
