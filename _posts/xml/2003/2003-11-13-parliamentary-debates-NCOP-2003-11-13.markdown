                              NOTICE OF MOTION

Dr E A CONROY: Mnr die Voorsitter, ek gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die
volgende sittingsdag sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem dat die agb lid Adriaan van Niekerk vroeër in die Raad 'n
       Debat van Openbare Belang aangevra het na aanleiding van die  droogte
       en die brande wat in onder andere die Noord-Kaap gewoed het; en


  (2) van mening is dat die positiewe debat wat deur al die  lede  van  die
       Raad oor die saak gevoer is en die feit dat die  agb  Voorsitter  van
       die Raad die debat toegestaan het, 'n  bydrae  gelewer  het  tot  die
       aankondiging gister deur  die  Minister  van  Finansies,  mnr  Trevor
       Manuel, dat R58 miljoen begroot is vir droogtehulp in die Noord-Kaap;
       en


  (3) kennis neem dat inspraak en betrokkenheid lei tot die  oplossing  van
       probleme.
(Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Dr E A CONROY: Chairperson, I give notice that at the next sitting  of  the
Council, I shall move:


  That the Council -
  (1) notes that, the hon member Adriaan van Niekerk requested a debate  on
       a Matter of Public Importance pursuant to the drought and  the  fires
       that raged in, inter alia, the Northern Cape;


  (2) is of the opinion that the positive debate conducted by  the  members
       of the Council on the matter and the fact that the hon Chairperson of
       the Council  gave  permission  for  the  debate  contributed  to  the
       announcement on 12 November 2003  by  the  Minister  of  Finance,  Mr
       Trevor Manuel, that R58 million had been budgeted for drought aid  in
       the Northern Cape; and


  (3) notes that consultation  and  commitment  leads  to  the  solving  of
       problems.]

Mnr F ADAMS: Voorsitter, ek gee  hiermee  kennis  dat  ek  op  die  volgende
sittingsdag van hierdie Raad sal voorstel:


  Dat die Raad -
  (1) die President bedank vir sy bereidwilligheid om heroorweging te skenk
       aan die kwessie van die stemreg  van  Suid-Afrikaners  wat  hulle  op
       stemdag in die buiteland bevind ná die Regering se deeglike oorweging
       van die billike en konstruktiewe vertoë deur die Nuwe NP  en  die  VF
       Plus, soos deur hom aangekondig in sy  repliek  in  antwoord  op  die
       leier van die Nuwe NP in die Raad se toespraak op 11 November 2003;


  (2) sy misnoeë uitspreek oor die goedkoop politieke  propaganda  van  die
       agb lid Sandra Botha van die DA oor die  aangeleentheid  van  stemreg
       vir Suid-Afrikaners in  die  buiteland  soos  vervat  in  haar  brief
       gepubliseer in die Volksblad van 11 November  2003,  synde  dieselfde
       dag waarop die President sy voormelde aankondiging  in  hierdie  Raad
       gemaak het  toe  die  gemelde  agb  Sandra  Botha  nie  in  die  Raad
       teenwoordig was nie; en


  (3) van mening is dat die aankondiging deur die President weer  eens  die
       waarde bewys  van  die  konstruktiewe  oplossingsgerigte  aanpak  van
       kwessies in teenstelling met die futiliteit van  die  blote  raas-en-
       blaas-styl van politiek van die DA.

[Tussenwerpsels.] (Translation of Afrikaans notice of motion follows.)

[Mr F ADAMS: I give notice that at the next sitting of the Council, I  shall
move:


  That the Council -


  (1) thanks the President for his willingness to reconsider the matter  of
       enfranchising South Africans who are abroad on polling day after  the
       Government's thorough consideration  of  the  fair  and  constructive
       representations by the New NP and the VF Plus  as  announced  by  the
       President in his reply to the speech of the leader of the New  NP  in
       the Council on 11 November 2003;


  (2) expresses its displeasure at the cheap political  propaganda  of  the
       hon member Sandra Botha of the DA on the issue of voting  rights  for
       South Africans in  her  letter  published  in  Die  Volksblad  on  11
       November 2003, the same day the President made the said  announcement
       in this Council when the hon Sandra Botha  was  not  present  in  the
       Council; and


  (3) notes that the announcement by the President again proves  the  value
       of constructive problem-directed addressing of issues as  opposed  to
       the futility of the DA's huff and puff style of politics.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): We shall now  come  to
the motions without notice. [Interjections.] Why  are  we  confused?  What's
happening? [Interjections.] What's wrong, Mr Raju?

Mr N M RAJU: A notice of motion, Sir.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): A  notice  of  motion?
But I called you earlier and you said you had nothing.  [Interjections.]  Is
it a motion without notice or notice of a motion?

Mr N M RAJU: Well, to be honest, it's an obituary. I'm not  certain  whether
it is a notice of motion or a motion without notice. [Interjections.]

An HON MEMBER: A motion without notice!

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Without notice.

Mr N M RAJU: I'll take the one on sport.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): OK.  We  now  come  to
the motions without notice.

                PERFORMANCE OF SPRINGBOKS IN RUGBY WORLD CUP

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mr N M RAJU: I move without notice ÿ.ÿ.ÿ. [Laughter.]


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that the once mighty Springboks -


       (a)  decisively won the Rugby World Cup in 1995, ushering in a  sense
           of euphoria and magnetic unity to a divided Republic; and


       (b)  return home today from Down Under having abdicated their laurels
           in pathetic performances,  culminating  in  an  uncharacteristic
           exit from the quarter-final crunch match against their  nemesis,
           the All Blacks of New Zealand;


  (2) calls upon the  SA  Rugby  hierarchy  not  to  indulge  in  defensive
       semantics, but to concede and acknowledge that  something  is  indeed
       rotten in the state of Denmark;


  (3) further calls upon the  SA  Rugby  Board  to  seriously  analyse  the
       reasons for the parlous situation in  which  the  country's  national
       sport  of  rugby/football  finds  itself,  to  adopt   a   thoroughly
       professional approach to whatever needs to be done and to ensure that
       our beloved Springbok is saved from extinction;


  (4) further calls upon the SA rugby-loving  public,  as  disappointed  as
       they are, not to be too despondent, but to hope, in the words of  the
       poet Percy Bysshe Shelley:  "If  winter  comes,  can  spring  be  far
       behind?"

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Are you objecting,  Mr
Matthee? In the light of the objection, the  motion  may  not  be  proceeded
with. The motion without notice will now become notice of a motion.

               DROWNING OF CHILD IN PELICAN PARK SWIMMING POOL

                             (Draft Resolution)
Mrs J N VILAKAZI: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes with sadness the death of the two-year-old son of  an  ANC  MP,
       who drowned in the communal pool of the  Pelican  Park  parliamentary
       village on Tuesday;


  (2) further notes that this incident could have been prevented if  safety
       regulations had been adhered to and the pool's  gate  latch  had  not
       been broken;


  (3) believes that the father, Mr Zunaid Kotwal from Mpumalanga,  said  on
       Wednesday he had been in a meeting  of  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
       Agriculture and Land Affairs when he received the news of  his  son's
       death;


  (4) urges the Minister of Public Works to ensure that safety  regulations
       at the communal pools are adhered  to  as  all  the  grounds  of  all
       parliamentary villages in the city  are  the  responsibility  of  her
       department; and


  (5) expresses its condolences to the family members and friends  who  are
       affected by this death.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

Ms C BOTHA: Mr Chairperson, I do not want to object. I wonder  if  it  would
be in order if we asked this House to  rise  for  a  moment  of  silence  in
sympathy with the loss experienced.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): OK, I  shall  consider
that.

Mr Raju? Why are you standing, Mr Raju? Do you wish to raise something  with
regard to the same motion?

Mr N M RAJU: No. [Laughter.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Mr  Raju,  you  having
been standing, unnoticed, the whole of this afternoon. Can  you  wait  until
your turn comes, please?

                           DIABETES AWARENESS WEEK

                             (Draft Resolution)

Dr P J C NEL: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes that -


       (a)  Diabetes Awareness Week started on Monday, 11 November 2003, and
           runs to Sunday, 16 November 2003;


       (b)  in South Africa the incidence of  diabetes  is  growing  rapidly
           with about one million diagnosed diabetics and an estimated  one
           million more walking around undiagnosed;
       (c)  the International Diabetes Association has recently warned  that
           the number  of  people  with  diabetes  is  expected  to  double
           worldwide in the next 15 years, and in Africa, to treble;


       (d)  some specialist physicians are seeing this silent epidemic to be
           as serious as the "Aids epidemic";


       (e)  this epidemic costs the country hundreds of  millions  of  rands
           annually; and


       (f)  early diagnosis and proper care of  diabetes  can  prevent  more
           than 50% of  serious  complications,  including  strokes,  heart
           attacks, amputations due to gangrene and blindness; and


  (2) requests the Minister of Health to run a special  campaign  to  alert
       South Africans to the danger of  diabetes  by  communicating  the  10
       early warning signs to them, as early detection of diabetes is  vital
       to avoid serious irreversible damage - this should be done  not  only
       during this week but as part of an ongoing process.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Ms  Botha,  I've
considered your request. Normally we only observe a moment of  silence  when
it's a member of  this  House,  so  unfortunately  your  request  cannot  be
complied with.

              BURGERS HALL FARM - RESTORATION OF LAND OWNERSHIP

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms M P THEMBA: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


   (1)      notes with joy that on 15 November  2003  members  of  the  Giba
         community in White River, Mpumalanga, will become proud  owners  of
         Burgers Hall farm, a piece of land from which they  were  displaced
         half a century ago;


   (2)      acknowledges that the dispossession and denial of rights to land
         have resulted in the  present  unequal  division  of  land  and  in
         landlessness;


   (3)      further acknowledges that since 1994 the ANC-led Government  has
         implemented a number of policies that provide access to land,  both
         as a productive resource and to ensure that  all  citizens  have  a
         secure place to live; and


   (4)      believes the restoration of land ownership to the Giba community
         is a direct result of the success of these policies.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

              RACIAL ATTACK ON FEMALE LEARNER IN SCHOOL GROUNDS

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms E N LUBIDLA: Deputy Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


   (1)      views seriously the fact that a young, black female learner from
         Edgemead High  School  in  the  Western  Cape  was  targeted  in  a
         racially abusive act by another learner and her parent;


   (2)      condemns with outrage the inhumane manner in which this  learner
         was viciously attacked;


   (3)      further notes that the learner will still need a great  deal  of
         counselling to overcome the trauma and indignity that she  suffered
         as a result of this action;


   (4)      also notes that we are already almost 10 years into a  democracy
         that  protects  every  citizen  from  being  a  target  of   racist
         behaviour; and


   (5)      urges that -


         (a)     the Department of Education intervenes  on  behalf  of  the
              aggrieved learner and gives  her  all  the  support  that  she
              needs;


         (b)     the Department of Education investigates issues  of  racism
              in all schools across the country;


         (c)     the full force of the justice system  is  brought  down  on
              the perpetrators of this racially motivated crime; and


         (d)     ordinary South  Africans  in  our  new  democracy  who  are
              justifiably  outraged  by  the  racist  actions   assist   the
              Department of Education by reporting cases as they occur.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF THE NCOP (Mr M J Mahlangu): Mr Sulliman?

Mr M A SULLIMAN: Chairperson, I shall no  longer  move  my  motion,  because
mine was similar to that of the hon member Vilakazi.

      HEAVY VEHICLES - STRICTER LAWS PERTAINING TO INSPECTION AND FINES

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms B THOMSON: Chair, I wish to move a motion without notice:


  That the Council -


   (1)      notes that in the wake of the numerous fatal accidents involving
         trucks, the Department of Transport has decided to  draft  stricter
         laws for heavy vehicles;


   (2)      further notes that the new regulations would  include  permanent
         roadblocks at the entrance of  each  magisterial  district,  making
         two drivers available for trucks crossing  borders,  heavier  fines
         imposed on  offenders,  repeated  offenders  losing  their  trading
         licences, more weigh  bridges  and  an  inspectorate  for  checking
         overloaded trucks;


   (3)      acknowledges the steps that have  already  been  taken  by  some
         local government authorities such as the Tswane Metro Council  that
         has already set up  a  checkpoint  which  compels  all  heavy  duty
         drivers to stop and have their vehicles inspected  before  entering
         the city; and


   (4)      welcomes these steps as further proof of the commitment  of  the
         Minister of Transport and provincial  departments  to  enhance  the
         safety of our transport system.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

 SA POLICE SERVICE - FIRST FEMALE PROVINCIAL DEPUTY COMMISSIONER IN GAUTENG

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Mr Chairperson, I beg to move  a  motion  without  notice  in
this prestigious House:


  That the Council -


   (1)      commends the Gauteng Legislature on their appointment  of  their
         first female provincial deputy commissioner in  the  South  African
         Police Service, commissioner  Zukiswa  Mbombo,  who  is  the  third
         female deputy commissioner in the country;
   (2)      notes that as she has been in the police force for 23 years,  it
         is very probable that many men  of  less  experience,  service  and
         qualifications have been promoted over her many times;


   (3)      congratulates her on  her  background  in  nursing,  an  honours
         degree in policing from the University of Zululand  and  a  diploma
         in financial management from Unisa;


   (4)       also  notes  that  she  has  headed  departments  dealing  with
         logistics,   finances,   human   resources,   communications    and
         management services in the Gauteng police service;


   (5)      regrets that women still  have  to  be  overqualified  to  merit
         promotion; and


   (6)      therefore hopes and trusts that more women  and  youth  will  be
         recognised and empowered to serve in this new South Africa.

[Applause.]
Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

     COMMUNAL LAND RIGHTS BILL - TRANSLATION INTO ALL OFFICIAL LANGUAGES
                                  REQUIRED

                             (Draft Resolution)

Me C BOTHA: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) kennis neem van die ``  Communal  Land  Rights  Bill''  waaroor  tans
       openbare  voorleggings  in  die  Portefeuljekomitee  oor  Landbou  en
       Grondsake gemaak word;


  (2) daarvan kennis neem dat -


       (a)  ten spyte daarvan dat die wetsontwerp grootliks  betrekking  het
           op dié deel van die bevolking wat nie Engels as eerste of  selfs
           tweede taal magtig is nie,  geen  amptelike  vertaling  van  die
           wetsontwerp beskikbaar is nie;


       (b)  die  portefeuljekomitee  in  Augustus  2002  onderneem  het  dat
           oorlegpleging oor hierdie wetsontwerp nie sal plaasvind  voordat
           dit vertaal is in die inheemse tale van die 15 miljoen mense wat
           regstreeks deur dié wetsontwerp geraak word nie;


       (c)  hierdie gebrek aan vertaling  indruis  teen  die  gees  van  die
           grondwetlike vereistes wat die staat  verplig  om  praktiese  en
           positiewe stappe te doen om  die  status  van  hierdie  tale  en
           gemeenskappe te verhoog; en


       (d)  dit die wetgewende proses onnodig vertraag en verdag maak; en


  (3) versoek dat die Minister vir Landbou en  Grondsake  onmiddellik  werk
       maak om die wetsontwerp in alle landstale beskikbaar te stel.
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Ms C BOTHA: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) takes note  of  the  Communal  Land  Rights  Bill  for  which  public
       representations are at present being made in the Portfolio  Committee
       on Agriculture and Land Affairs;


  (2) notes that -


       (a)  in spite of the fact that the Bill largely applies to that  part
           of the population that is not in command  of  English  as  their
           first or even second language, no official  translation  of  the
           Bill is available;


       (b)  the  portfolio  committee  undertook  in  August  2002  that  no
           deliberation on this Bill would take place  until  it  has  been
           translated into the  indigenous  languages  of  the  15  million
           people who are directly affected by the Bill;


       (c)  this lack of translation is in conflict with the spirit  of  the
           constitutional  requirements  that  compel  the  state  to  take
           positive steps to enhance the  status  of  these  languages  and
           communities; and


       (d)  it delays the legislative process  unnecessarily  and  makes  it
           suspect; and


  (3) requests the Minister for Agriculture and Land Affairs to take  steps
       immediately  to  have  the  Bill  translated  into   all   indigenous
       languages.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON  OF  THE  NCOP  (Mr  M  J  Mahlangu):  Is  there  any
objection? [Interjections.] In the light of the objection,  the  motion  may
not be proceeded with. The motion without notice will now become  notice  of
a motion.
                             DEATH OF KEN GAMPU

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mr N M RAJU: Chair, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


  (1) notes -


       (a)  with sadness the passing away of one  of  South  Africa's  great
           Black actors, film star Ken Gampu,  who  died  at  his  home  in
           Vosloorus on the East Rand a week ago after a long illness;


       (b)  that Ken Gampu was indeed a trailblazer, having acted with  such
           distinction alongside great actors such as Richard  Todd,  Roger
           Moore, Richard Burton,  Anthony  Quinn,  Gavin  Hood  and  Nigel
           Hawthorne; and


       (c)  that some of the films in which he starred  were:  A  Reasonable
           Man - his most recent film, made in 1999, Dingaka, Zulu Dawn,  A
           Game of Vultures, Naked Prey, King Solomon's Mines, Tigers Don't
           Cry and others;


  (2) remembers Ken Gampu for his imposing stage  appearances  in  township
       jazz opera King Kong; A Xmas Story and Ipi Tombi  - SABC viewers will
       also remember Ken Gampu's roles in dramas such as  Gaz'lam,  Diggers,
       Riverman, Soul City and John Ross;


  (3) acknowledges that Ken Gampu did the country proud, especially  as  he
       was, in the world of arts and theatre, the silver lining  during  the
       dark clouds of apartheid madness; and


  (4) conveys its heartfelt condolences to his surviving wife and sons  and
       mourns with them the loss of a great African.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

           SUPREMACY OF THE LAW AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY

                             (Draft Resolution)

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Voorsitter, ek stel hiermee sonder kennisgewing voor:


  Dat die Raad -


  (1) opnuut sy absolute verbintenis tot die oppergesag van die reg en  die
       onafhanklikheid  van  die   regbank   as   'n   hoeksteen   van   ons
       konstitusionele demokrasie  bevestig,  en  daarom  die  Minister  van
       Veiligheid en Sekuriteit bedank -


       (a)  vir sy onmiddellike en absolute onvoorwaardelike onderneming, na
           samesprekings met 'n afvaardiging van die Nuwe Nasionale  Party,
           na aanleiding van die ongelukkige insident  van  die  arres  van
           landdros  Hendrik  van  der  Walt  van  Groblersdal,  dat   daar
           hoegenaamd  geen  inmenging  met  enige  regsprekende   beampte,
           insluitende  moontlike  arrestasie,  sal  wees  as  gevolg   van
           enigiets  wat  'n  regsprekende  beampte  mag  doen  in  sy/haar
           hoedanigheid as 'n regsprekende beampte nie;


       (b)  vir sy aanstelling van 'n ondersoek op hoë  vlak  onder  leiding
           van die Nasionale Speurhoof, Kommissaris Johan de Beer,  na  die
           hele aangeleentheid;


  (2) van mening is dat die vinnige en besliste optrede  van  die  Minister
       die Regering se verbintenis bewys tot die oppergesag van die  reg  en
       die onafhanklikheid van die Regbank asook die waarde  bewys  van  die
       konstruktiewe oplossingsgerigte bedryf van die politiek deur die Nuwe
       NP en die ANC teenoor die futiliteit van die  afbrekende,  negatiewe,
       sensasiesoekende, kontraproduktiewe lawaaimaak, "veg terug"-styl  van
       politiek van die DA;


     (3)    die hoop uitspreek dat die gemelde ondersoek so gou as  moontlik
         afgehandel sal  word  sodat  die  nodige  regstellende  optrede  so
         spoedig moontlik kan plaasvind.

  That the Council -


  (1) once again confirms its absolute commitment to the supremacy  of  the
       law and the independence of the judiciary as  a  cornerstone  of  our
       constitutional democracy,  and  therefore  thanks  the  Minister  for
       Safety and Security -


       (a)  for his  immediate  and  absolutely  unconditional  undertaking,
           following discussions with a delegation from  the  New  National
           Party, arising from the unfortunate incident of  the  arrest  of
           magistrate Hendrik van der Walt  from  Groblersdal,  that  there
           will be absolutely no interference with  any  judicial  officer,
           including possible arrest, as  a  result  of  anything  which  a
           judicial officer might do in his or her capacity as  a  judicial
           officer;


       (b)  for his appointment  of  a  high-level  investigation  into  the
           entire matter under the  leadership  of  the  National  Head  of
           Detectives, Commissioner Johan de Beer;


  (2) is of the opinion that the swift and decisive action of the  Minister
       is proof of the Government's commitment to the supremacy of  the  law
       and the independence of the judiciary and demonstrates the  value  of
       the constructive solutions-oriented practice of politics by  the  New
       NP and the ANC, as  opposed  to  the  futility  of  the  destructive,
       negative, sensation-seeking, counterproductive, noisy, ``fight-back''
       style of politics of the DA;


  (3) expresses the hope that  the  aforementioned  investigation  will  be
       completed as soon as possible so that the necessary corrective action
       can be taken as quickly as possible.

Motion agreed to in accordance with section 65 of the Constitution.

                     MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT

                             (Draft Resolution)

Ms R P MASHANGOANE: Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the Council -


   (1)      welcomes the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement by the Minister
         of Finance, Trevor Manuel;


   (2)      commends the Minister for the increase in expenditure on  social
         development which  targets  the  poor  and  enhances  their  social
         protection; and


   (3)      believes that the Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement  reaffirms
         the view that the eradication  of  poverty  through  sustained  and
         accelerated economic growth  continues  to  remain  the  overriding
         priority of the ANC-led Government.

   PORTRAYAL OF PARTIES INVOLVED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE IN TV PROGRAMME
                                THIRD DEGREE

                             (Draft Resolution)

Rev M CHABAKU: Mr Chairperson, I move without notice:


  That the council -
  (1) notes that -


       (a)  the television programme Third Degree showed cruelty  meted  out
           to a wife and mother and her children on  Saturday,  7  November
           2003; and


       (b)  the faces of the beaten and  humiliated  wife  and  the  starved
           children were repeatedly and clearly shown whereas  the  husband
           and father, who  was  the  alleged  perpetrator,  had  his  face
           blurred; and


  (2) is of the opinion that it is sad that during this  special  focus  on
       violence and cruelty to women and children, the victims  are  further
       exposed to the viewers while the man  who  allegedly  made  them  eat
       spoiled pig's food and  sjamboked  the  mother,  was  protected  from
       identification; and


  (3) condemns this selective justice and trusts that relevant bodies  will
       take up this resolution for attention.

                  GENERAL INTELLIGENCE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY:  Chairperson  and  hon  members,
this Bill is a technical measure. Nothing controversial  is  being  proposed
in these  amendments.  The  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  National  Strategic
Intelligence Act, 1994; the Intelligence Services Oversight Act,  1994;  the
Intelligence Services Act, 2002; and the Electronic Communications  Security
(Pty) Ltd Act, 2002.

The  National  Strategic  Intelligence  Act,  1994,  and  the   Intelligence
Services Oversight Act, 1994, were amended in 2002, whilst the  Intelligence
Services Act, 2002, and the Electronic  Communications  Security  (Pty)  Ltd
Act, 2002, were passed in that year.

In general, the Bill seeks to  amend  the  said  Acts  so  as  to  eliminate
inconsistencies in the provisions of the Acts and  also  to  effect  certain
consequential amendments as a result of the adoption by  Parliament  of  the
Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-
Related Information Act, 2002.

In this Bill,  the  object  of  the  amendments  proposed  to  the  National
Strategic Intelligence Act is to make provision for the establishment  of  a
panel of appeal to assist the  Minister  in  the  consideration  of  appeals
lodged in terms of the said Act.

The amendments proposed to the Intelligence Services Oversight  Act  are  to
regulate the oversight  of  the  Office  for  Interception  Centres  and  to
provide for the secondment of members  of  the  Departments  of  Safety  and
Security and of Defence to the Office of the Inspector-General.

The amendments proposed to the  Intelligence  Services  Act,  2002,  are  to
clarify the lines of accountability of the Intelligence Services Council  on
conditions of service, and to align the provisions  of  this  Act  with  the
provisions of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act  with  respect  to  the
acquisition of immovable property by the Minister for Intelligence.

The amendments proposed to the Electronic Communications Security (Pty)  Ltd
Act, 2002, are to extend the  composition  of  the  board  of  directors  by
increasing  the  number  of  nonexecutive   directors;   to   restrict   the
publication of certain regulations; and to ensure that the regulations  that
deal with security matters are not published in the Gazette.

With these amendments, we are confident that  the  legal  framework  of  the
intelligence  services  and  other   entities   under   the   Minister   for
Intelligence are tight enough  to  meet  the  national  security  challenges
facing most nations today. I thank you. [Applause.]

Kgoshi M L MOKOENA: Thank you, Chairperson. [Interjections.] Members,  I  am
humbled by your  acknowledgement.  Let  me  start  by  thanking  the  Deputy
Minister for outlining the purpose of these amendments.  I  will  make  sure
that I do not repeat some of the critical points he touched on.  So  I  will
simply avoid making repetitions and deal with the other issues.

As rightly said, this Parliament in the year  2002  effected  amendments  to
two of the four Bills we are amending today. After looking at what  used  to
happen in the past, we deemed it fit and proper to effect and come  up  with
these kinds of amendments in this legislation.

As we are aware, intelligence has a critical role  to  play  in  identifying
threats,  potential   threats   and   opportunities   for   our   democratic
dispensation. Our belief is that  the  role  of  the  National  Intelligence
Agency is to gather, collect and evaluate information that pertains  to  the
national security of the state and its citizenry.

Another role of the intelligence services is to act in the interests of  the
country as a whole, unlike in  the  past  when  the  intelligence  was  used
vehemently against freedom  fighters  and  the  popular  resistance  of  the
people. Our policy dictates that national intelligence  should  respect  the
rights of all  South  Africans  and  that  it  needs  to  engage  in  lawful
activities.

The task of transforming the intelligence apparatus in our country has  come
a long way. For intelligence to be of value, it  must  have,  amongst  other
things,  the  following  attributes:  accuracy,  relevance  and   predictive
powers. Our transformed intelligence community has all  the  basic  features
common to intelligence services worldwide.

As you are aware, the NIA and the SA Secret  Service  have  a  quasi-medical
aid scheme which is funded by the state and not its members. It is for  this
reason that we debated in terms of this Bill  and  unanimously  agreed  that
the personnel electronic communications security, commonly called  Comsec  -
join the NIA medical aid scheme which is  operational.  However,  Comsec  is
exempted from the Medical Schemes Act, but Comsec  members,  like  those  of
the NIA, will comply with the  principles  and  objectives  of  the  Medical
Schemes Act.

As you are fully aware, the new Medical Schemes Act  makes  full  disclosure
by members  compulsory.  Such  disclosures  will  expose  the  NIA  and  its
undercover agents. It is for this reason that  the  negotiations  that  have
been entered into by the NIA and the Department of Health will come up  with
regulations addressing this matter. The NIA will  have  its  own  laws,  but
such laws will not be excluded from this principle of equity.

We must accelerate transformation in the National  Intelligence  Agency  and
turn it into an institution whose personnel reflect the demographics of  the
country as a whole. The mission  of  intelligence  is  to  conduct  security
intelligence within the borders of the Republic of South Africa in order  to
protect the Constitution.

Members of the committee effected those  amendments,  and  those  amendments
were accepted by the department with broad smiles. The department said  that
if they had money, they were going  to  throw  a  braai  for  our  committee
because we identified issues that  they  could  not  identify.  That  is  my
committee.

Having said all that, Chairperson, I put this  Bill  before  you,  following
what my hon Minister has just said to this august House, but listen  to  the
hon Maloyi, the hon Kondlo, the hon Matthee and the hon Lever,  because  you
will learn a lot. [Interjections.] [Applause.]

Mnr P A MATTHEE: Mnr die Voorsitter, die agb Adjunkminister en ook  die  agb
voorsitter van ons komitee het reeds met die tegniese gedeeltes  gehandel  -
veral die Adjunkminister - en dit baie duidelik uitgespel en ek  sal  daarom
glad nie daarna verwys  om  dit  te  herhaal  nie,  behalwe  om  te  sê  dat
belangrike wysigings wat broodnodig was in hierdie wetgewing  vervat  is  en
van die Nuwe NP se kant steun ons dit ten volle.

Ek wil graag verwys na die persone, ons mense, die personeel en die  agente,
wat  in  die  geheim  en  sonder  dat  enigiemand,  behalwe  'n  paar   baie
uitgesoekte mense weet, goeie werk doen. Dit is absoluut  noodsaaklike  werk
waarvan so min van ons bewus is. Wanneer ons veilig in die nag  gaan  slaap,
dan is hierdie mense aan die werk, waaroor ook  al,  baie  keer  onder  baie
moeilike en selfs lewensgevaarlike omstandighede. Ek wil vandag hulde  bring
aan elkeen van hulle en van ons kant van hierdie Raad sê  ons  waardeer  die
baie harde werk wat hulle doen, soms onder moeilike omstandighede.

Ek het die voorreg gehad om vir 'n hele tyd lank gedurende die  eerste  jare
van ons demokrasie saam met onder andere die agb Adjunkminister te  dien  in
die Gesamentlike Staande Komitee oor Intelligensie. Die  Adjunkminister  sal
onthou hoeveel moeilike en sensitiewe aangeleenthede ons  gedurende  daardie
eerste jare in daardie komitee moes hanteer.

Die vertroue in mekaar se integriteit wanneer 'n mens met daardie tipe  sake
werk, wat dikwels baie plofbaar is, het nie  maar  net  vanself  gekom  nie,
soos die Adjunkminister sal onthou. Maar ons het dit reggekry om  onder  die
leiding van uitstekende voorsitters, aan wie ek ook wil hulde  bring  -  die
huidige Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, die huidige Adjunkminister van  Binnelandse
Sake, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, asook die  huidige  voorsitter,  dr  Cwele  -
soos wat ons meer en meer  moeilike  en  sensitiewe  aangeleenthede  hanteer
het, vertroue in  mekaar  se  integriteit  te  ontwikkel,  sodat  dit  amper
tasbaar gegroei het.

Die President het ook in sy  repliek  Dinsdag  verwys  na  daardie  moeilike
situasies, as ons terugkyk oor die 10 jaar van ons demokrasie, wat ons  moes
hanteer. Dit is met dankbaarheid dat ons vandag daarna kan terugkyk  en  kan
sien hoe ons dit reggekry het om, sonder dat dit enigsins publisiteit  gekry
het, altyd 'n oplossing te vind in die beste belang van al die  burgers  van
ons land en van die toekoms van Suid-Afrika.

Ek wil vandag ook hulde  bring  aan  ons  kollegas  wat  steeds  in  daardie
komitee dien, wat baie harde werk doen en wat nie, soos wat  ons  ander  kan
doen, verklarings uitreik oor die  werk  wat  hulle  doen,  en  dit  in  die
openbaar doen nie, want dis altyd belangrik vir 'n  politikus.  So,  ek  wil
ook vandag aan elkeen van hulle hulde bring.

Ek dank u met  die  woorde  dat  ons  hierdie  wetgewing  steun.  [Applous.]
(Translation of Afrikaans paragraphs follows.)

[Mr P A MATTHEE: Chairperson, the hon Deputy Minister as  well  as  the  hon
chairperson of our committee have already dealt with the technical  parts  -
especially the Deputy Minister  -  and  made  it  very  clear  and  I  would
therefore not refer to it at all and  so  repeat  it,  except  to  say  that
important amendments that were absolutely necessary were entrenched in  this
legislation and from the New NP's side, we fully support it.

I would like to refer to the people,  our  people,  the  personnel  and  the
agents, who in  secret  and  without  anybody  knowing,  apart  from  a  few
selected persons, did exceptional work. This is  absolutely  essential  work
that very few of us are aware of. When we are safely tucked  into  our  beds
at night, these people are hard at work, wherever, quite  often  under  very
difficult and even life-threatening  circumstances.  I  would  like  to  pay
tribute to every one of them today and from our  side,  that  this  Council,
say that we appreciate the very  hard  work  they  are  doing,  often  under
difficult circumstances.

I had the privilege for  quite  a  while  during  the  first  years  of  our
democracy to serve with, inter alia, the hon Deputy Minister  on  the  Joint
Standing Committee on Intelligence. The Deputy Minister might  remember  how
many difficult and sensitive matters we had to deal with in  this  committee
during those first years.

The trust in one another's integrity when one  deals  with  those  types  of
matters, that are often very volatile, did not  just  happen  automatically,
as the Deputy Minister will remember. But we managed to, under the  guidance
of exceptional chairpersons, whom I would also like to pay tribute to -  the
current Minister  Lindiwe  Sisulu,  the  current  Deputy  Minister  of  Home
Affairs, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, as well as  the  current  chairperson,  Dr
Cwele - as we dealt with increasingly more difficult and sensitive  matters,
trust in one another's integrity developed,  so  that  it  increased  almost
tangibly.

The President also referred in his  reply  on  Tuesday  to  those  difficult
situations, as we look back on the 10 years of our democracy,  that  we  had
to deal with. It is with gratitude that we may look back  at  it  today  and
see how we  managed  to,  without  getting  any  publicity,  always  find  a
solution in the best interests of all the citizens of our  country  and  the
future of South Africa.

I would also like to pay tribute today  to  our  colleagues  who  are  still
serving on that committee, who are doing very  hard  work  and  who  cannot,
like the rest of us, issue statements regarding the  work  they  are  doing,
and this in public, because it is always very important  for  a  politician.
So, I would also like to pay tribute to every one of them.

I thank you with the words that we support this legislation. [Applause.]]

Mr P D N MALOYI: Thank you, Chair. Chairperson, I had a discussion with  the
chairperson of the select committee as usual; that was yesterday  at  14:35.
We agreed and he assured me that for the first time in this  House  I  would
be given no less than 10 minutes. Unfortunately,  when  I  arrived  here  my
speaking time was six minutes. So I was forced to adjust my speech.  So  I'm
going to try my best to speak in six minutes.  I  see  it  is  ten  to  now.
Hopefully by three o'clock  I  would  have  done  my  work  in  this  House.
[Laughter.]

The National Strategic  Intelligence  Act  of  1994,  as  amended  in  2002,
empowers  members  of  the  national  intelligence  structures  to   conduct
security-screening investigations to determine the  security  competence  of
persons who are employed by or applicants to an organ of state.

When we were briefed by the department, one of the  key  things  which  they
mentioned  to  our  committee  -  listen  carefully,  this   is   classified
information  -  was  that  our  intelligence  structures  didn't  have   the
necessary resources, both human and material resources, to  enable  them  to
perform what is expected of them in terms of section 2A.  They  proposed  an
amendment which, as a committee, we agreed  on,  namely  that  it  would  be
necessary for us to allow the Minister to have  the  discretion  as  to  who
should be  investigated  in  this  matter.  Because  if  you  are  going  to
investigate everybody you are going to need a lot  of  resources,  which  we
don't have.

But let me also  share  this  information  with  you.  I  have  assured  the
department and my  committee  that  I'm  going  to  discuss  this  with  the
chairperson of the finance committee  and  the  chairperson  of  the  budget
committee, in order to ensure that we give this department enough  resources
to perform its constitutional obligations. I was  with  the  chairperson  of
the finance committee this morning. He told me we would meet  at  half  past
three. So I'll be rushing to that meeting immediately after this  debate  to
continue that particular discussion. [Laughter.]

As a committee we agreed that it was necessary for us to give  the  Minister
that particular discretion. The  Minister  will  then  draw  up  regulations
which will guide the national intelligence structures as to who is  supposed
to be screened, etc. Basically I think what we will focus on  are  sensitive
areas, such as the office of the  Minister,  the  office  of  the  director-
general and so  forth.  I  hope  I've  lectured  these  members  very  well.
[Interjections.] Lovely! [Laughter.]

I think the Minister did speak about the Intelligence Services Act. I  think
the amendments there are fairly technical. I'm not going to talk much  about
that, because I'm left with two minutes only. This section -  just  to  make
sure that every member of this House understands what we are  talking  about
- is creating an administrative nightmare in the department.  It  stipulates
that every transaction involving immovable property, sale  of  old  cameras,
computers, hiring of property, etc must be  approved  by  the  Minister.  We
don't think - and we think that you'll agree with us  -  that  the  Minister
should be bogged down with all those petty things. We think it is  necessary
for the Minister to deal with political issues  and  issues  that  need  the
intervention of the  Minister.  But  regarding  those  minor  administrative
issues: let the director-general and  the  administrative  staff  deal  with
those things. So  this  is  what  we  wanted  to  do  with  this  particular
amendment. And I know that Mr Raju, a member of the DA, will agree  with  us
that this amendment is necessary. We  are  therefore  presenting  all  these
amendments before you, hon members, to adopt  them  and  agree  with  us.  I
thank you. [Applause.]

Mr L G LEVER:  Chairperson,  when  I  prepared  for  this  debate  I  had  a
premonition that this situation that  I  find  myself  in  might  occur.  In
listening to the hon Deputy Minister's speech I thought  I  might  have  two
areas to deal with, which his comprehensive speech didn't touch  on,  namely
the medical aid for Comsec and section 70 of the Public  Finance  Management
Act. But then on hearing the hon Kgoshi Mokoena dealing with medical aid,  I
thought that I would be left with one area to deal  with.  Then  on  hearing
the hon Maloyi dealing with section 70  of  the  Public  Finance  Management
Act, all that is therefore left for me to say, without using my time  simply
for the purpose of using it, is that the DA  supports  these  amendments  in
this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]

Ms  N  C  KONDLO:  Hayi,  Sihlalo,  andizi  kulandela   ela   khondo.   [No,
Chairperson, I am not going to go that route.]

Chairperson, hon members, the ANC-led Government has, in just less  than  10
years, been able to change the lives of ordinary people for the better.  All
of us, across our political backgrounds, acknowledge this fact, even  though
some political parties are not bold enough to say this publicly.

When we speak of the successes of the ANC-led Government, correctly so,  our
focus is always on tangible deliveries such as equity in social  grants  and
more access to  housing,  to  water,  the  construction  of  roads  and  the
building of schools and clinics.

Equally, and as one speaker said in this House,  there  are  those  freedoms
that our people enjoy which cannot be quantified,  such  as  human  dignity.
One of the most fundamental freedoms that the  majority  of  South  Africans
enjoy today is the freedom from the repression of the security forces  under
the leadership of the apartheid regime. This and the work  of  these  forces
were characterised  by  secrecy,  exclusivity,  being  above  the  law  and,
amongst  other  things,  special   relationships   between   superiors   and
subordinates.

These structures used criminals and gangsters to abduct, maim and  kill  our
comrades. Sizwe Kondile, Eric Ntonga, the Mxenges, the "Cradock four",  Neil
Aggett, Bathandwa Ndondo and many others are examples of  these  atrocities.
This they did with the backing of the law.

Since the negotiations and the 1994 breakthrough, we have seen how  the  ANC
has led our country into a new intelligence dispensation through  laws  that
have been passed by  Parliament.  Central  to  all  these  laws  remain  the
security, the development and the prosperity of our country, as  the  vision
of the Ministry indicates. More importantly, these laws have  been  made  to
ensure a credible and accountable service to our people.

The General Intelligence Laws  Amendment  Bill  in  front  of  us  is  about
consolidating the above. I won't  get  into  the  details  of  the  specific
amendments to the four laws that have been referred to, as all the  speakers
before me have touched on them.

Xa  ndigqibezela,  inye  into  endifuna  ukuthetha  ngayo:   kukunqongophala
kwesakhono  kweli  sebe   sokuqinisekisa   ukuba   ukuphononongwa   kwabantu
abaqeshwa nguRhulumente  kuyenziwa.  Sithi  ke,  lo  Mthetho  uYilwayo  uthi
amasebe, ngokweentloko zawo,  mayibe  ngawo  achongayo  imisebenzi  enokuthi
ifanele ukuphononongwa. (Translation of isiXhosa paragraph follows.)

[In conclusion, there is one point I want  to  make:  there  is  a  lack  of
capacity in this department to ensure that the screening of people  entering
the Government's employ takes place.  Therefore,  this  Bill  provides  that
departmental heads be the ones who decide which jobs require screening.

Yes, this scenario is acceptable in the circumstances, but there is  a  need
to ensure that more resources are allocated  to  this  department  for  this
purpose,  because  some  managers,  because  they  lack  this   intelligence
expertise, might regard some of these areas as "risk  personnel"  when  they
are not necessarily risk personnel areas,  and,  in  so  doing,  information
that should not be leaked to the public, for purposes best known to  all  of
us, would then be leaked to the public.

Kuba buhlungu, maxa wambi, xa kudandalaziswa umsebenzi weli candelo  nezinto
obe unokucinga okokuba bezingafanele  kuvela  naphi  na,  nanjani  na.  Uthi
wakumamela uqonde okokuba ziya benzakalisa abanye abantu kuba  ngokuthetheka
kwazo naphina, nanjani na, abantu bayazigqibela.

Ndenza isicelo ke sokuba  abasebenzi  abajongene  nale  micimbi  kweli  sebe
lokuphononongwa kwabantu mabalugcine kubo olu  lwazi.  Loo  nto  ke  ithethe
ukuthi kufanele sibe nabasebenzi  eneneni  abaluphumelelayo  ngokungenaxhala
olu phononongo, khon' ukuze nesebe eli lifumane intlonipho kwaye  lithembeke
njengoko inzondelelo yalo isithi:


  ... to develop and nurture a professional and dedicated workforce that is
  beyond reproach.

Ngala mazwi ambalwa siyazixhasa ezi zihlomelo,  ngelithi  isigunyaziso  seli
sebe siza kuqinisekiseka  ngakumbi  ukuba  njengoko  siqhuba  siyiguqula  le
mithetho, iza kuqinisekisa  ukuba  sinee"intelligence  structures  that  are
credible, that will do  their  work  without  any  fear  of  contradiction".
[Kwaqhwatywa.] (Translation of isiXhosa paragraphs follows.)

[It pains one,  on  certain  occasions,  when  the  kind  of  work  of  this
department, that one would consider as  sensitive,  is  put  in  the  public
arena. On  such  occasions  you  get  the  feeling  that  divulging  certain
information is hurting the image of certain people because people out  there
tend to draw their own conclusions on the basis of this information.

I appeal, therefore, that the  people  responsible  for  security  clearance
checks should be sworn to silence. This means, really,  that  we  must  have
people who have passed this  security  clearance,  so  that  the  department
could be accorded the respect it deserves  and  be  trusted,  in  accordance
with its mission statement, which is:


  ... to develop and nurture a professional and dedicated workforce that is
  beyond reproach.

With these few words we support these amendments because, as we continue  to
amend these laws, we will make sure that we  have  "intelligence  structures
that  are  credible,  that  will  do  their  work  without   any   fear   of
contradiction. [Applause.]]

The DEPUTY MINISTER OF SAFETY AND SECURITY: Chairperson and hon  members,  I
wish to express my gratitude for the all-party support which has been  given
to these amendments.

This emphasises a tradition which we have managed to observe up  to  now  in
our country, that all intelligence matters are national matters and are  not
governed by party-political considerations. This  is  very  crucial  in  the
life of any nation,  and  I'm  happy  that  in  our  discussions  here  this
afternoon this has obviously been the major criterion. Let us hope  that  we
will continue to have  a  broad  national  policy  on  intelligence  matters
because that will, in fact, reflect whether or not we are succeeding in  our
major task of building a new nation. Thank you, Sir. [Applause.]

Debate concluded.

Bill, subject to proposed amendments, agreed to in accordance  with  section
75 of the Constitution.

The Council adjourned at 15:01.
