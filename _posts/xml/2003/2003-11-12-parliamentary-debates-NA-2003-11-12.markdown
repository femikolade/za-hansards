    STATEMENT ON MEDIUM-TERM BUDGET POLICY STATEMENT AND INTRODUCTION OF
                       ADJUSTMENTS APPROPRIATION BILL

The MINISTER OF FINANCE: Madam  Speaker,  Mr  President,  Deputy  President,
colleagues and honourable Members, South Africa is a great place to  be  in.
[Applause.] A few weeks ago, Tom Ainsley, the CEO of  Elliot  International,
one of the larger removal companies  in  the  country,  was  speaking  on  a
business radio show. In  discussing  his  company's  financial  results,  he
commented that in the 1980s, the number of people  that  his  company  moved
out of South Africa exceeded the number of people moving  in  by  about  ten
times. For the past two years however, the  number  of  people  leaving  the
country has roughly equalled the number of people  being  brought  into  the
country. In September this year, for the first time since his  tenure  began
in 1979, the number of people being brought into the  country  exceeded  the
number of people leaving. Skilled South Africans are  coming  back;  skilled
professionals are choosing to move here.

While this may be anecdotal, it signals a  realisation  by  people  of  good
judgement that this country is a great place to be in.  A  realisation  that
if you take a serious look around, you soon recognise that you'd  rather  be
here than anywhere else.

Madam Speaker, it is this confidence that we are here to speak about  today.
We are here to talk about the way in which we have weathered  the  storm  of
global uncertainty, the way in which we are  standing  tall  and  about  why
this country  is  a  great  place  to  be  in.  But  more  importantly,  our
confidence is driven by our ability to give  meaning  to  our  vision  of  a
better  life  for  all  South  Africans,  especially  the   poor.   We   are
progressively realising the social and economic rights  of  our  people,  we
are building the foundations for stronger growth  and  employment  creation,
we have a policy framework in place to bridge the divide between  the  first
and the second economies that is still  such  a  pervasive  feature  of  our
society, as President Mbeki reminded us yesterday.

Under the leadership of the Policy Co-ordination  and  Advisory  Service  in
the Presidency, the impact and effectiveness of our policies and  programmes
since 1994 have come under considered scrutiny. The findings of this  review
are set out in a publication titled Towards a Ten Year Review  -  a  careful
and frank assessment which  I  would  like  to  commend  to  this  House  as
compulsory reading, not just for the insights it contains, which  are  many,
but also because it provides an intelligent and balanced point of  departure
for the next phase in our transformation journey.

In framing this year's Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement,  we  have  drawn
strongly on this work and the challenges it presents for  the  years  ahead.
We have also had the benefit of the results of the  2001  census,  published
by Statistics South  Africa  earlier  this  year.  The  census  and  various
publications of Statistics SA  are  the  sharp-edged  tools  of  our  policy
analysis. They show where we have made progress - bringing  electricity  and
water to townships and rural communities, improving access  to  schools  and
clinics, improving growth and investment in our economy. They  also  outline
the magnitude of the challenges before us - creating enough jobs  for  those
who seek work, addressing the remaining backlogs in water,  electricity  and
sanitation  infrastructure  and  improving  the  quality  and  relevance  of
further education and training programmes.In keeping with the spirit of  the
Growth and Development Summit Agreement this  year,  these  challenges  call
for partnerships between government, business and civil society.

The financial  services  charter  signed  last  month  takes  several  steps
forward  in  this  transformation  agenda.  It  sets  targets  for   several
empowerment challenges: transforming management, in addition  to  ownership,
corporate social investment alongside  financing  empowerment  transactions,
access to financial services and small  business  development.  The  charter
sees the delivery of services to the `unbanked' as both a  social  objective
and an opportunity for business growth.

 When we tabled the  Budget  in  this  house  earlier  this  year,  we  were
optimistic  that  the  global  economy   would   recover.   This   has   not
materialised.  While  growth  in  the  US  shows  signs  of  recovery,  most
developed countries are still in  difficulty.  GDP  growth  in  Europe,  our
major trading partner,  this  year  is  forecast  at  just  one  half  of  a
percentage point. Against this  background,  our  economy  has  displayed  a
remarkable degree of resilience.

Yes, it is true that our economy has grown more  slowly  than  we  initially
anticipated. The  global  slowdown  in  2001  and  2002,  coupled  with  the
dampening effect of the strong rand on our foreign trade  performance,  have
held back faster growth. At the time of the Budget we anticipated growth  of
3,3% this year. The revised estimate is growth of 2,2% in  2003,  rising  to
3,3% next year and 4% by 2006. However, the domestic demand in  our  economy
is growing strongly due to lower interest rates, expansionary fiscal  policy
and the relative stability of the currency. Investment spending  is  at  its
highest level in almost a  decade.  A  sustained  higher  rate  of  economic
growth is clearly a central requirement if we are to achieve our  objectives
of employment creation, poverty reduction and  broadening  participation  in
economic opportunities. This means  we  need  to  boost  investment  in  our
people, our physical infrastructure and industrial capacity.

The MTBPS outlines our strategy for reinforcing  investment  and  broadening
participation in the South  African  economy.  Building  on  the  agreements
reached between government, business, labour  and  community  constituencies
at the Growth and Development Summit in June this year,  we  have  a  shared
vision for  improving  the  performance  of  our  economy.  Key  initiatives
include:  Enhancing  public  infrastructure  capacity,  including   critical
transport and communication linkages; an expanded  public  works  programme,
extending job creation  initiatives  across  a  broad  developmental  front;
improving the regulatory environment and resolving obstacles that  stand  in
the way of the  expansion  of  small  businesses;  expanding  education  and
training and accelerating enrolment in learnerships  to  underpin  long-term
job  creation;  deepening  social  security  programmes  to  provide  income
support to the most vulnerable; a  broad-based  black  economic  empowerment
strategy; and strengthening  sectoral  partnerships  and  local  development
initiatives.

This development agenda  rests  on  the  foundations  of  the  macroeconomic
consolidation we have achieved  -  a  moderate  budget  deficit,  a  healthy
balance of payments and lower inflation. Members will recall  that  we  were
obliged to correct an error in  the  consumer  price  indices  earlier  this
year.  Partly  as  a  result  of  this  correction,  but  also  because  the
underlying rate of inflation has decreased  steadily,  we  now  expect  CPIX
inflation to average  6,9%  in  2003,  compared  with  the  February  budget
estimate of 7,7%.

Following an increase in CPIX inflation to 11,3% in October 2002  after  the
steep depreciation of the rand in the  second  half  of  2001,  year-on-year
inflation fell to 5,4% in September this year. This  brings  inflation  well
within the target range of 3 to 6%, and we expect it to stay in  this  range
over the three years ahead. The moderation in inflation over the  past  year
has enabled the Reserve Bank to lower  interest  rates  by  five  percentage
points since June, bringing welcome relief  to  households  and  creating  a
decidedly more favourable environment for business investment.

The prime-lending rate is at its lowest level in seventeen years. There  are
also benefits to the fiscus, as Government is currently able  to  borrow  at
lower interest rates than we have seen  since  June  1974.  Our  thanks  and
congratulations are due to Governor Mboweni and  his  team  at  the  Reserve
Bank - may they continue their  good  work.  [Applause.]  I  am  pleased  to
report that we have agreed on a  number  of  amendments  to  the  inflation-
targeting framework within which the  Reserve  Bank  conducts  its  monetary
policy responsibilities. Rather than expressing  the  target  as  an  annual
average for each calendar year, the 3 to 6% range will now be  a  continuous
target within which the Bank will seek to maintain the monthly rate of  CPIX
inflation, as measured on a year-on-year basis. This range  will  remain  in
place for 2006 and  future  years,  until  a  revised  target  is  set.  The
procedures for dealing with unanticipated  shocks  to  the  inflation  trend
have  also  been  refined.  These  adjustments  bring  greater  clarity  and
practicality to the inflation-targeting framework.

Lower inflation, lower interest rates and a relatively stable currency  have
contributed to a marked improvement in business  confidence  in  the  second
half of this year:  Fiscal  policy  and  tax  considerations;  the  proposed
framework for the 2004 Budget again gives priority  to  reinforcing  growth,
creating a conducive environment for job  creation  while  deepening  social
security spending and infrastructure investment targeted to address  poverty
and vulnerability.

We have revised down our revenue estimate for this year by R5 billion.  This
is partly because the economy is growing more slowly than  anticipated,  and
also because corporate profits have fallen  in  the  wake  of  the  economic
slowdown and the appreciation of the rand. For the  years  ahead,  a  stable
tax-GDP ratio of just under  25%  of  GDP  is  projected  for  the  national
budget.

Taking into account the revised financing requirement, lower interest  rates
and lower rand costs of servicing foreign debt, total debt service costs  of
R47,2 billion in 2003-04 are anticipated, which is R3,8  billion  less  than
the original budget estimate. This brings debt service costs  down  to  3,9%
of GDP from 4,2% last year, again  releasing  resources  for  allocation  to
productive expenditure. For the MTEF period ahead, debt  service  costs  are
expected to decline further to 3,7% of GDP in 2006-07.

Debt  costs  together  with  the  revised  estimate  of  R284,3  billion  in
noninterest expenditure this  year  bring  total  expenditure  on  the  main
budget to R331,5 billion. The budget deficit will be  R31,6  billion,  which
is 2,6% of projected GDP, compared with a main budget estimate of 2,4%.  The
MTBPS proposes a framework  that  allows  for  real  growth  in  noninterest
spending of 5,7% next year and an  average  of  4,4%  over  the  next  three
years, after over 10% real growth this year - a strong  fiscal  stimulus  in
response to the current slowdown in economic activity, made possible by  the
healthy state of the public finances after several years of consolidation.

The main budget deficit will rise to 3,2% of GDP next year and then  decline
to a projected 2,8% by 2006-07. However, the consolidated national  deficit,
which takes into account projected surpluses on the social  security  funds,
is expected to remain below 3% of GDP over the MTEF period. After  providing
for extraordinary payments and receipts and the  financing  requirements  of
provinces, municipalities, other government bodies and public  corporations,
the aggregate public sector borrowing requirement is expected to be 3,5%  of
GDP next year.

This  is  a  growth-oriented  fiscal  framework  that  affirms  Government's
commitment  to  long-term  sustainability  -  reflected  in  the   continued
declining cost of servicing debt as a share of GDP. It is a  framework  that
provides for strong growth in  infrastructure  investment  by  national  and
provincial government,  while  also  accommodating  the  increasing  capital
requirements in the years ahead of the major parastatals,  including  Eskom,
Transnet and its subsidiaries and our larger water utilities.

Major tax reforms of recent years - the  introduction  of  a  capital  gains
tax, adoption of  a  residence-based  income  tax  system  and  other  base-
broadening measures - have put tax policy on a sound footing and  allow  for
a period of consolidation in the years ahead.  Certainty  in  both  the  tax
policy framework and its administration creates an environment conducive  to
growth and investment.

Nonetheless there are refinements to  the  tax  structure  in  progress,  or
under consideration. These include: Reform of  the  taxation  of  retirement
savings; introduction of accelerated depreciation allowances for  designated
urban  development  zones;  tax  relief  to  support  business   investment,
research and development and  business  start-up  expenses;  tax  relief  on
dividends  from  foreign  investments;  rationalisation  of  the  principles
governing VAT on government grants  to  public  entities  and  subsidies  to
businesses;  a  levy  on  plastic  bags,  in  recognition  of  environmental
considerations;  and  development  of  a  royalty  regime  for  mineral  and
petroleum products.

In several of these areas, legislation is already  before  Parliament  -  in
others, such  as  the  proposed  royalty  regime,  comment  from  interested
parties is under review and revised proposals  will  be  tabled  during  the
course  of  next  year.  The  deadline  for  the  foreign  exchange  amnesty
announced in February this year is now extended to 29 February 2004.
I am also advised by  Commissioner  Gordhan  that  the  Revenue  Service  is
working tirelessly in  its  efforts  to  meet  revenue  targets  this  year,
despite the downward revision in projections. Active  measures  are  focused
on areas where non-compliance remains high or fresh evidence  of  abuse  has
emerged.

We have been gratified to see  the  public  response  this  year  to  SARS's
return filing campaign, which included widespread advertising,  help  kiosks
in shopping  and  community  centres  and  extended  office  hours.  On  the
deadline date of 11 July, 410 752 returns were submitted - hugely  exceeding
expectations.  Additional  staff  is  being  appointed  to  deal  with   the
processing  of  returns.  Other  initiatives  that  have  proved  successful
include the launch a year ago of SARS Service Monitoring Office,  which  has
dealt with about 5 000 incidents in its first year  of  operation,  and  the
introduction this year of an alternative dispute  resolution  option,  which
will shortly also be adapted for the customs and excise environment.

With regard  to  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  and  division  of
revenue, I turn now to the proposed Medium Term  Expenditure  Framework  for
the next three years.

The budget framework provides for an additional R37 billion to be  allocated
to national votes, provinces and local government transfers  over  the  next
three years. Drawing on the findings of the Ten Year  Review  and  the  2003
Growth and Development Summit Agreement, spending plans for the  next  three
years will include an Expanded Public Works Programme to contribute  to  job
creation,  reinforcement  of  infrastructure  investment  and   maintenance,
provision for higher education transformation and  skills  development,  and
further investment in municipal infrastructure and services. These  policies
were reaffirmed through the  GDS  process  in  which  Government,  business,
labour and community representatives committed to work  together  to  foster
people-centred development.

Significantly, employment creation and skills  development  emerged  as  the
focus of social partners  and  is  indeed  at  the  centre  of  Government's
development strategy for the next decade. As  outlined  by  His  Excellency,
President Mbeki, in the NCOP yesterday, the Expanded Public Works  Programme
will be central to meeting this goal  and  is  one  of  the  key  agreements
arising from the Growth and Development  Summit.  A  growing  proportion  of
current infrastructure allocations will be  directed  towards  labour  based
construction methods, resulting in more  jobs  for  low-skilled  individuals
and valuable training to serve them in future years.

Infrastructure grants to provinces and municipalities rise by  R3,2  billion
over baseline and will be the main source  of  funding  for  this  programme
with technical support from a dedicated unit in the national  Department  of
Public Works.

The proposed division of revenue  sees  a  gradual  shift  of  resources  in
favour of provinces and municipalities.  The  majority  of  social  services
are, in fact, delivered by provinces where  health,  education  and  welfare
spending are prioritised. Programmes  in  this  sector  embody  Government's
core commitment to human capital and  social  development.  This  forms  the
bedrock of our strategy to reduce poverty  and  support  vulnerable  groups,
including  the  aged,  children  and  the  disabled.  That  is  why   social
development  budgets  will  continue  to   grow   strongly   to   meet   our
constitutional commitments of providing  for  the  needs  of  these  groups,
amongst others.

Notably, phasing in the extension of the child support grant to children  up
to the age of 14 accounts for continued  rapid  growth  in  social  security
expenditure. Including sharp increases  in  the  numbers  of  recipients  of
disability grants over the past year, we are now paying  monthly  grants  to
over seven million people - up from under 3 million six years ago.  Starting
from about 2% of GDP, the social security system now takes up 4% of  GDP.  A
recent research project  focused  on  the  child  support  grant  has  again
confirmed that our social grants programmes are  well  targeted,  contribute
on a large scale to reducing income poverty,  and  that  the  new  grant  is
making significant progress in meeting the needs of vulnerable children.

Local government receives the biggest percentage increase  in  the  proposed
framework due to its  vital  role  in  delivering  basic  services  to  poor
communities.  Government   is   committed   to   investing   in   low-income
neighbourhoods and under-served communities, in part through the free  basic
services programme which provides a minimum package  of  municipal  services
including electricity, water, refuse removal and sanitation. This is  a  big
challenge for municipalities and will  remain  a  priority  for  the  medium
term. As part of the process to  create  sustainable  neighbourhoods,  local
government is stepping up infrastructure  delivery  through  a  consolidated
Municipal Infrastructure Grant. Through this new mechanism, Government  will
target the removal of backlogs in water, sanitation  and  electricity,  thus
promoting the social and economic rights of citizens over time.

There are several other priorities in the social services. The  years  ahead
will  also  see  about  R3  billion  spent   on   the   transformation   and
recapitalisation of higher education institutions, and rapid growth  in  the
number of workers and learners benefiting from  skills  programmes  overseen
by sector education and training authorities (Setas).

Education continues to dominate social services. Funding of learner  support
materials and other supplies  for  schools  will  be  strengthened  and  the
primary school nutrition programme  will  shift  from  health  to  education
departments. These targeted interventions seek to  improve  the  quality  of
learning for students, particularly those in  poor  areas.  Over  time,  the
substantial and  growing  investments  in  school  education  together  with
ongoing reforms in higher education will create a deeper pool of  skills  to
support economic growth. It is notable that the National  Student  Financial
Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is producing solid financial results while continuing  to
increase the number of awards  to  academically  deserving  and  financially
needy students.

The  budget  framework  makes  provision  for  the  roll  out  of  treatment
programmes in response  to  HIV  and  AIDS.  Earmarked  allocations  on  the
national Health vote will go up to R1,1 billion  next  year,  rising  to  R2
billion  by  2006-07.  Total  expenditure  in  response  to  HIV  and  AIDS,
including amounts directly spent  by  provincial  health  departments,  will
exceed R3 billion next year, R4 billion in 2005-06 and R4,8 billion in 2006-
07. As the costs of drugs come down and our capacity improves,  the  ability
to treat an even larger group of people becomes possible.

Spending on justice, crime prevention  and  security  services  will  expand
moderately over the years ahead, with  additional  resources  earmarked  for
establishing Child Justice Centres, modernisation of  court  management  and
information systems and further expansion of the  Police  Service.  We  have
consistently made allocations to this  sector  in  order  to  stabilise  and
reduce the incidence of crime. We believe that progress  is  being  made  in
the fight against crime, though much more can be done,  and  will  be  done,
through increased resources, better management, and better systems to  allow
the departments in this sector to work more closely  and  more  efficiently.
Children bear an inordinate burden of crime and  violence  in  our  country.
Ultimately, reducing levels of crime improves the quality of  life  for  all
South Africans and benefits the most vulnerable.

Priorities in the economic services  include  further  investment  in  water
services  and  sanitation,  provision  for  infrastructure  associated  with
industrial development zones and enhanced spending on land  restitution  and
land reform. Strong support continues for investment in  housing  and  basic
water, sanitation, electrification, transport and communication services.

The budget framework includes amounts of R1 billion in 2004-05,  R2  billion
in 2005-06 and R3 billion in 2006-07 set aside to  support  the  broad-based
black economic empowerment strategy. South Africa's diplomatic services  and
peacekeeping  operations,  in  support   of   NEPAD   objectives,   regional
development and international co-operation will be  enhanced.  Provision  is
made  for  forthcoming  elections,  and  allocations  to  support   improved
services of the Department of Home Affairs are proposed.

The 2003 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement proposes, in  sum,  progressive
strengthening  of  public  expenditure  across  a  broad   set   of   policy
priorities, and  framed  within  a  consistent  and  growth-oriented  fiscal
policy framework and a  stable  overall  tax  burden.  The  fastest  growing
category  of  spending  at  present  is  our  portfolio  of  social   grants
programmes, and in particular, income support for children under the age  of
14. This is as it should be - for our children are our future, and while  we
have such inequality, and such a gap between  employment  opportunities  and
the number of work seekers, as we have, we must give priority to this  basic
contribution   to   household   food   security   and   mitigating    income
vulnerability. But over the longer term, over  the  decade  ahead,  we  must
also be mindful of the great responsibility we have to  invest  in  building
productive  capacity,  developing  a  learning  society  and  creating  work
opportunities. This is, after all, our investment in the livelihoods of  our
children beyond the age of 14, and in their capacity to nurture and  support
our children's children, and beyond. And so we  also  have  to  contain  the
extension of our social security system  within  reasonable  and  affordable
limits, and channel a growing share of resources  to  education,  to  skills
development, to  housing,  water  and  sanitation,  to  building  roads  and
modernising our transport networks and to our particular place  at  some  of
the frontiers of research, technology and scientific achievement. This is  a
question of balance, in the interests of progress across a  broad  front  of
social and economic development.

The Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement proposes  a  practical,  progressive
development of public expenditure and services over 2004 MTEF period  ahead,
which Parliament is invited to consider over the weeks ahead. The  House  is
also requested  to  consider  an  Adjustments  Appropriation  Bill  for  the
financial year ending 31 March 2004. Its details are explained in  the  2003
Adjusted Estimates of National Expenditure. Why is this necessary? Like  the
best laid plans, they sometimes need adjusting. This  is  where,  in  brief,
the executive appeals to the legislature for  increases  in  allocations  to
some programmes, decreases in others, shifts of funds between  votes  -  all
by comparison with the appropriations passed by the House just a few  months
ago. There is of course no limit whatever to  the  kinds  of  requests  that
careless departments might  make  at  this  time,  but  the  Public  Finance
Management Act, in order to avoid unduly trying the patience of  the  House,
sets strict criteria. The most important is that new  allocations  can  only
be for emergencies - unforeseen and unavoidable expenditure.

This year the Treasury committee has approved, amongst  other  amounts,  the
following: R103 million for the  Department  of  Home  Affairs,  mainly  for
unanticipated costs of the Lindela Detention Centre and for the  current  ID
campaign in preparations for the elections next year; R34  million  for  the
rehabilitation of flood-damaged infrastructure in the Western Cape  and  for
provincial and local Government to settle outstanding liabilities to  eleven
KwaZulu-Natal municipalities; R180  million  to  the  Department  of  Public
Works  for  unanticipated  rates  and  municipal  charges  owing  on   state
properties;  R90  million  for   the   Department   of   Health   to   begin
implementation of a broader treatment plan for  HIV/Aids;  R27  million  for
the Department of  Correctional  Services  for  unanticipated  increases  in
costs of health care for prison inmates, transport costs and  urgent  repair
works amongst the others;

A further R500 million to meet the unanticipated costs on the  Defence  Vote
of phase 3 of the United Nations peace missions in the DRC,  South  Africa's
participation in the Burundi peace mission and the provision of  support  to
the UN mandated interim emergency multinational force in Bunia from June  to
August this year; R36 million on the Agriculture Vote  to  combat  foot  and
mouth disease and provide emergency fodder  assistance  to  farmers  in  the
Limpopo  province;  R50  million  in  the  Communications   Vote   to   meet
unanticipated  costs  of  closure   of   the   Bophuthatswana   Broadcasting
Corporation and the settlement of liabilities to Icasa; R20 million  to  the
Department of Transport to meet urgent road repair  costs  to  a  number  of
border posts; and R346 million for  the  Department  of  Water  Affairs  and
Forestry, maily to respond to forest fires, meet  emergency  water  supplies
in drought-affected communities, settle unrecoverable  debt  obligations  of
several water user associations  and  meet  restructuring  costs  associated
with transfer of  staff  and  infrastructure  to  municipalities  and  other
entities.

Members of this House  will  recall  that  in  the  main  Budget  Speech,  I
announced that an allocation to provide  for  the  recapitalisation  of  the
Post Office will be made, subject to the separation of the  Post  Bank  from
the rest of the business and agreement on a business plan to put the  agency
on a sound financial footing. Cabinet has agreed to set aside  R750  million
for  this  purpose  and   the   Department   of   Communications   has   the
responsibility for ensuring that outstanding issues are resolved  to  enable
this capitalisation transfer to be effected before the end of the  financial
year.

The adjusted estimates  also  provide  R2,1  billion  in  transfers  to  the
provinces to meet unforeseen and  unavoidable  expenditure,  mainly  arising
from a more rapid uptake of disability  grants  and  other  social  benefits
than we had anticipated. A further R100 million will go to the provinces  as
conditional grants  to  meet  higher  than  anticipated  budgeted  costs  of
extending the child support grant to seven and eight year-olds this year.

Honourable members will observe that an amount of R400 million  is  provided
for on the National Treasury Vote in the Adjustments Appropriation Bill  for
additional service  benefits  for  members  of  Parliament  and  members  of
provincial legislatures. [Interjections.] Wat wil julle hoor? [What  do  you
want to hear?] [Laughter.]

Members who do not return to their  elected  office,  who  have  left  their
seats, will receive a supplementary service term benefit  equivalent  to  an
annual pensionable salary for a completed term of service, up to  a  maximum
of two terms.

There are certain other adjustments. Taking into  account  the  higher  than
budgeted Public Service salary increases in July this year, R150 million  is
allocated to national departments and R257  million  to  provinces.  Amounts
totalling R423 million are appropriated on various votes in respect of self-
financing expenditure, donations received  for  specific  purposes,  revenue
generated from the sale of military equipment, a refund from the  land  bank
of unutilised disaster relief funds,  a  recovery  of  fraudulently  claimed
subsidy  payments  from  a  bus  operator  and  operational   revenue   from
Government forest areas.

The adjustments appropriation also provides for  R1,1  billion  in  approved
roll-overs of monies unspent by national departments in the previous  fiscal
year. In total, R5,4 billion  in  additional  expenditure  is  proposed,  of
which R2,5 billion will go directly to the provinces. But,  there  are  also
savings to report, believe it for not. The state debt  costs  will  be  R3,8
billion less than anticipated in February, mainly as a result of a  stronger
Rand. Defence expenditure on the strategic arms procurement  programme  this
year will be R1 billion less than budgeted. An expenditure  brought  by  the
Department of Foreign Affairs is reduced by R114 million.

An amount of R250 million budgeted for  the  transfer  to  the  Unemployment
Insurance Fund will not be required as the fund  is  running  a  substantial
surplus  at  present.  About  R200  million  for  capital   works   on   the
Correctional Services Vote will not be spent this year. An  amount  of  R215
million  on  the  Housing  Vote  is  surrendered  as   a   result   of   the
disestablishment  of  the  SA  Housing  Trust  and  the  transfer   of   its
liabilities into Government debt.

Taking into account these savings, the contingency reserve of R3 billion  in
the main budget framework and an anticipated  underspending  of  about  R700
million on various Votes,  the  revised  expenditure  level  for  2003-4  is
R331,5 billion, or R2,5 billion less than the main budget estimate. On  this
fiscally  responsible  concluding  note,  I  commend  the  2003   Adjustment
Appropriation Bill for further consideration of this House.

South Africa is a great place to be. [Applause.] Not just because we have  a
sound economy, beautiful beaches,  game  parks,  cultivate  wonderful  wine,
produce wonderful kwaito music and have a  Finance  Minister  who  has  just
given R400 million to members of Parliament, but because  as  a  nation,  we
are building our future. We are doing so by confronting  our  past.  We  are
addressing our challenge, growths and development performance, and  the  gap
between the modern economy and the marginalised communities.

We are dealing with these issues. We have a  sound  economy,  a  responsible
budget framework, a plan to raise the level of investment  in  the  economy,
firm proposals to tackle unemployment, strong  growth  in  social  transfers
and  a  concerted  drive  to  lower  the  levels  of  crime.  It   is   this
determination of our people that makes this country a  great  place  to  be.
[Applause.]

In looking  back  at  the  development  of  economic  policy  in  our  young
democracy over the past decade, there has been one  outstanding  force  that
we should acknowledge today. I refer to the influence of  Maria  Ramos,  the
outgoing Director-General of National Treasury. [Applause.] As a  leader  in
the Treasury and the economic arena in a broader sense, Maria has  played  a
decisive role in strengthening the linkages between growing the economy  and
fighting poverty. It is her unstinting commitment and understanding  of  the
role  that  macroeconomic  stability   plays   in   reducing   poverty   and
enemployment in the long term that she will be remembered for.

On behalf of all in the National Treasury, and  the  entire  team,  we  wish
Maria well in her new endeavours. I don't know where  she  is.  Oh!  she  is
back in the box. We are confident that she will make as great an  impact  on
our transport industry, as she had on our  public  finances.  I  would  also
like to thank my colleagues in Cabinet and in  particular,  the  members  of
the Minister's Committee on the Budget.  Special  thanks  go  to  provincial
finance MECs, the FFC and the SA Reserve Bank.  Finally,  I  would  like  to
express my sincerest appreciation to all of you, for having the patience  to
listen to me this afternoon. Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The Bill, together with related papers tabled,  referred  to  the  Portfolio
Committee on Finance for consideration and report.

           PRECEDENCE GIVEN TO STATEMENT BY THE MINISTER OF HEALTH

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The next item on the Order Paper is a statement  by  the
Speaker ... Where is the Speaker? We need the Speaker to  come  and  make  a
statement.

Hon members, may we delay the statement by the Speaker. I am sure  there  is
no objection to us delaying that. I would like us  to  go  on  to  the  next
item. We will come back to the statement.

The next item is an opportunity requested by the hon Minister of  Health  to
make a statement on Diabetes  Week.  I  now  afford  her  that  opportunity.
[Applause.]

              STATEMENT BY MINISTER OF HEALTH ON DIABETES WEEK

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: Deputy Speaker, my colleagues in the  House,  as  we
approach 10 years of freedom and democracy it should be clear to all  of  us
that  South  Africa  has  changed.  More  people  have  houses,  water   and
sanitation than ever before. Our schools are places of learning for all  our
children. Gradually, our cultural institutions are beginning to reflect  our
multicultural nature. Great  strides  have  been  made  in  terms  of  black
economic empowerment. More people who  are  very  poor  qualify  for  social
assistance grants - there is so much that we can be proud of.

From a health perspective, we now have a  health  system  based  on  primary
health care. And, we have  built  hundreds  of  new  clinics  all  over  our
country to ensure that people have  access  to  health  services  relatively
close to where they live or work. We provide free medical care  to  pregnant
women and children under the age of six years; we facilitate termination  of
pregnancies; we strictly control tobacco use; we encourage  vaccination  and
ensure their availability; and we are  refurbishing  our  hospitals.  Again,
there has been so much change.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon members, please lower your voices.

The MINISTER OF HEALTH: But, not all change is positive. This is  especially
so from a health perspective. Currently, our country is undergoing  what  we
call an epidemiological transition. In simple language this means  that  our
people are beginning to fall  prey  to  different  kinds  of  illnesses.  In
particular, we find that more and more  people  are  coming  to  our  health
facilities with blood pressure problems, heart problems,  cancers,  strokes,
diabetes and vascular diseases. And this is the  case,  not  just  in  urban
areas but in rural areas as well.

All of these diseases  share  a  common  characteristic.  They  are  largely
diseases of lifestyle. In other words, these are  mostly  diseases  that  we
bring upon ourselves through the way that we live our lives. We bring  these
diseases on ourselves through the choices that we make.  In  short,  we  are
entirely responsible for some of the illnesses that we get.

You see, colleagues, in addition to seeing more clinics in  our  cities  and
towns, and in our rural  areas,  we  are  seeing  more  and  more  fast-food
outlets. As more and more people can afford to buy television sets,  we  see
more and more people sitting for hours in front of  their  television  sets.
And, as more and more people get  offices,  we  see  more  and  more  people
sitting at their desks all day  without  taking  the  necessary  breaks  for
exercise.

In short, we are, as a nation, becoming fatter and also much  less  fit.  We
have changed our diets to include greater amounts of bad food,  particularly
sugar and fat. We  are  eating  more  and  more  food  such  as  hamburgers,
icecream, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and so on, and chips.

We are also undertaking less and less physical activity. Some of us used  to
walk but are now driving cars all the time. Some of  us  used  to  undertake
physical activity around the house but are now getting other  people  to  do
it for us, or are just not bothering  to  do  it  at  all.  And,  these  two
things, what we eat and how much exercise we get, are the two components  in
our choice to live healthy or unhealthy lifestyles.

Diabetes is a common condition that is unfortunately  growing  in  scale  in
South Africa and in the rest of the world. In fact, according to  the  World
Health Organisation there is a diabetic epidemic  happening  in  the  world.
This is clear from the international statistics. In  1985  approximately  30
million people suffered from  diabetes.  Ten  years  later  the  figure  had
increased fivefold to 135 million people. By  2000,  estimates  had  reached
177 million and it is predicted that by 2025 there will  be  more  than  300
million diabetic people in the world.

Diabetes, a disease of lifestyle, was associated in  the  past  mainly  with
the developed world. However, the World Health  Organisation  is  predicting
that by the year 2025 more than 75% of all diabetic cases will be  found  in
the developing world. This will greatly increase the burden of  health  care
systems that have already been hit hard by communicable diseases.  In  South
Africa we, too, are a developing country, therefore the time  has  come  for
all of us to sit up and take notice.

More and more South Africans  are  presenting  health  institutions  with  a
variety of symptoms that result in a diagnosis of diabetes. We suspect  that
many more people may have symptoms of diabetes but are as  yet  undiagnosed.
Here are some of the  statistics  in  our  country.  It  is  estimated  that
approximately 3 million South Africans are currently diabetic  and  this  is
about 8% of our population. Approximately, 90% of all diabetic patients  are
over the age of 40 years. More than half of the South African diabetics  are
male. Asian South Africans have the  highest  level  of  diabetes  -  almost
double the national average and that is already alarming.  These  statistics
will become more catastrophic if we don't take action immediately.

The solution lies in our own hands: with education  and  prevention  we  can
stabilise and then hopefully reverse the trend -  it  is  possible.  Do  you
know whether you are not diabetic or have sugar problems?  Perhaps  some  of
us do. Many people do not, but that is  going  to  change,  starting  today.
This is Diabetes Week; it is a week that is set aside in  the  international
health calendar to raise awareness about diabetes. This  means  that  during
this week, in health facilities  all  over  the  world,  including  our  own
country, South Africa, health professionals will be making people  aware  of
what diabetes is, how it can be treated - and just as importantly,  how  not
to get it in the first place.

Diabetes is a complex disease, but every one of us can understand it and  do
something about it,  and  we  should.  Basically  there  are  two  types  of
diabetes: one type appears to be hereditary. In other words, it passes  down
from one family member to another. Of course,  we  have  less  control  over
this kind of diabetes which can strike even very  young  children.  But,  we
can prevent it from happening in some of our families, in the  first  place.
This kind of diabetes is called early onset diabetes.  The  second  kind  of
diabetes is called late onset diabetes.  It  can  occur  in  any  adult  but
mostly in those who are over the age of 45 years. This kind of diabetes  can
most easily be prevented or, at the very  least,  postponed,  especially  in
the high risk groups. It is all a matter  of  choice,  your  choice  and  my
choice.

You, as an individual, can do a lot to  prevent  yourself  and  your  family
members from getting diabetes in the first place. All you have to do  is  to
make a conscious choice to live a healthy lifestyle. If you  are  overweight
you can lose weight; if you are eating  fast  foods  you  can  start  eating
healthy food like fruit, vegetables and pap -  remember  to  add  garlic  as
well and also a lemon. [Laughter.] And, you can reduce your intake of  fatty
food or sugar; you can try not to overeat; and you can ensure that you  take
regular exercise at least five times a week. You don't need to go to  a  gym
to do so. A brisk 30-minute walk most days of the  week  will  improve  your
health and decrease the chance that you will develop diabetes.

Now, let me tell you how you will know if you  are  at  risk  of  developing
diabetes. You are at risk if you have a family history of diabetes;  if  you
are carrying excess weight; if you are over 45 years of age; if you  do  not
get regular exercise; if you are stressed; if you smoke cigarettes  and  any
tobacco products; if your diet is high in sugar and  carbohydrates;  if  you
have had sugar problems in the past or  if  you  have  had  diabetes  during
pregnancy. Just by listening to me  list  these  factors  you  realise  that
indeed that many of us are at high risk of diabetes.

There are  several  symptoms  which  indicate  that  you  may  already  have
diabetes or sugar  problems.  These  symptoms  include:  when  you  have  to
urinate frequently; when you have an abnormal thirst and a very  dry  mouth;
when you constantly feel tired or you lack energy; when you suddenly lose  a
lot of weight; when you seem to be hungry all the time,  even  if  you  have
just eaten; when you start experiencing  blurred  vision  or  when  you  get
recurrent skin infections that are slow to heal, or  when  your  skin  feels
itchy a lot of times.

Although there is no cure for  diabetes,  effective  treatment  does  exist.
With a timely diagnosis, access to appropriate  treatment  and  a  conscious
change to a healthy lifestyle a person with diabetes should be able to  lead
a normal active life, and reduce the risk of developing  complications  like
blindness and amputations.

In order to help parliamentarians know whether they are at risk of  diabetes
or not, the Department of  Health,  in  conjunction  with  a  pharmaceutical
company - Eli Lilly, has erected a stall in the  corridor  outside  the  Old
Assembly  to  provide  free  tests  for  diabetes  and  also  to  give   out
information. Many people were tested today and you would  be  surprised  how
many we have diagnosed as having diabetes. In fact, one of them already  had
it at the age of 28 and was already losing  her  vision.  If  you  have  not
already been tested, please go to the stall before the end  of  the  day  to
determine you blood sugar levels.

I urge you to think about what you  are  hearing  here  today.  If  you  are
currently experiencing any of the symptoms that I described a moment ago,  I
suggest that you go to  your  doctor  or  the  nearest  clinic  as  soon  as
possible.  If  you  had  a  test  done  today  and  your  sugar  levels  are
unacceptable, change your lifestyle to make sure that you keep  them  at  an
acceptable level. If you are borderline case seek medical help  and  if  you
are already diabetic make sure that you control your  diabetes  properly.  I
also ask you to take some of the pamphlets that are available today  at  the
testing booth back to your constituencies. You  can  make  a  real  positive
contribution to the health of our people if you take this  message  back  to
your constituencies and your communities.

We must work together to make sure that we are aware of diabetes and of  the
importance of changing our lifestyles. We must lift any stigma  attached  to
diabetes, and help educate people about the  prevention  and  management  of
diabetes. Your role  in  this  regard,  as  parliamentarians  and  community
leaders, cannot be overestimated.

Now, it is my pleasure to announce some very good news to this House.  There
are two significant new  programmes  relating  to  diabetes  that  are  just
beginning. Firstly, the Department of  Health  wants  to  inform  you  today
about a new public-private partnership that we are entering  into  with  the
pharmaceutical company  that  I  have  just  mentioned.  In  terms  of  this
programme, the pharmaceutical company will undertake to  implement  diabetes
training programmes for  health  professionals,  especially  nurses  in  our
provinces. They will start with training in our  less  advantaged  provinces
and in particular Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape and Limpopo.

This training will also coincide with the  implementation  of  the  diabetes
guidelines that have recently been developed by the  Department  of  Health.
In addition, the programme will include workshops and seminars  for  members
of the public and the dissemination of posters and pamphlets.  There  is  no
doubt in my mind  that  our  new  guidelines,  with  better  trained  health
professionals and with a better informed public, will be able  to  turn  the
tide on diabetes and lift the health levels of our people.

The second announcement concerns a programme  called,  ``Life  for  a  Child
with Diabetes''. This is an  international  partnership  between  Eli  Lilly
pharmaceuticals,  the   International   Diabetes   Federation   and   Rotary
International. In South Africa Eli Lilly will take  the  lead  role  in  the
roll-out of the programme. It is targeted at  finding  children  who,  as  a
result of poverty, cannot access diabetic treatment. The  Ministry  and  the
Department of Health welcome this programme and applaud it. I am assured  by
Eli Lilly that the Ministry will be kept abreast of the developments of  the
programme.

Diabetes need not swamp our country and eat up our resources, in  particular
our health resources. We can prevent it and as a result  save  lives  and  a
lot of money, and ourselves too. We can also manage  diabetes  properly  and
keep it under control. These two will save money for  other  pressing  areas
in health care - it also starts with you and me.

Please, colleagues, let us work together on  these.  Firstly,  I  am  asking
you, personally, to think before you eat and get as  much  exercise  as  you
can. Secondly, I am asking you to take this initiative into  your  families,
your communities and your constituencies. Together we can and  will  make  a
difference. I thank you very much. [Applause.]

Mr M  WATERS:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  an  estimated  three  million  South
Africans suffer from type two diabetes, which is  a  lifestyle  disease.  In
other words: it is man and woman made. Currently,  the  world  is  facing  a
massive epidemic of type two diabetes, and  at  the  International  Diabetes
Federation Conference held in Paris last month  it  was  revealed  that  the
number of people suffering from diabetes worldwide  has  increased  from  50
million in 1985 to 417 million. That is people who suffer from  diabetes  or
have the potential to.

The federation decided to  declare  diabetes  a  worldwide  catastrophe.  It
develops mainly through incorrect eating habits  and  a  lack  of  exercise.
Refined foods such as white bread, wheat flour and  fizzy  soft  drinks  are
all examples of incorrect eating, and coupled with fat in a diet,  it  is  a
lethal combination.

Having a hamburger and a fizzy drink is possibly the worst example  of  what
we can do to our physiology. The body simply does not know what to  do  with
such food and thus stores it as a fat. That is  why  so  many  of  us  start
sprouting ``boeps'' or spare tyres, as we call them.

South Africa is on its way to overtaking  America  as  the  world's  fattest
nation. A recent study by the Medical Research  Council  found  that  almost
half of South Africans over the age of 15 are overweight or obese.  What  is
worse, what used to be an adult condition,  is  now  affecting  children  as
young as ten years old;  as  parents  reward  their  children  with  sweets,
chocolates, hamburgers and chips.

Children need to be educated on the  dangers  of  overeating  and  incorrect
eating. Introduction of such a subject should be looked into for the  school
curriculum. In order to determine if you are at risk  of  becoming  diabetic
you should measure  your  waistline  in  relation  to  your  hips.  If  your
waistline is larger than your hips, you are a high risk person.

I do not believe that this House is a good  example  for  South  Africa.  We
only need to look around to see how close to home  the  problem  really  is.
Parliament  could  set  an  example  by  relooking  at  the  menu   of   the
parliamentary restaurants. [Interjections.]

The consequences of diabetes are heart  attacks,  strokes,  kidney  failure,
blindness and amputation. As diabetes is a non-notifiable  disease,  no  one
actually knows how much it is costing the country, because when a person  is
admitted to hospital for amputation or for any  other  condition  caused  by
diabetes, it is not recorded as a symptom of that  condition.  The  Minister
should consider making diabetes a notifiable disease.

What does boggle the mind is that the state refuses  to  provide  strips  at
Government hospitals in order for diabetics to test  their  sugar  levels  -
which is vital in the fight to control that disease. The cost  of  these  is
roughly R100 per month per patient. The cost of  an  amputation  is  roughly
R120 000, which the state does actually pay for.

South Africa has the highest amputation figures  in  the  world.  Surely  it
makes more sense to provide these strips at a cost of R100  per  month  than
to spend tenths of thousands of  rands  to  avoid  unavoidable  amputations?
With South Africans piling on the fat at an enormous rate, it is  high  time
that we as leaders of the country led the way by showing  the  country,  and
the youth in particular, that  eating  right  is  the  right  thing  to  do.

Dr R RABINOWITZ: Madam Deputy Speaker, when I was trained as a doctor,  that
was somewhere back in the last century, a diagnosis of diabetes was a  cause
for great concern. It meant  one  would  have  to  undergo  repeated  needle
pricks for blood tests  and  for  insulin  treatment,  and  probably  suffer
infections, high blood pressure, coronary strokes and vascular disease,  but
with the progress of medical science, fortunately for  us,  those  days  are
gone. Diabetes is a highly manageable chronic illness, so long as one  knows
that one has it and takes the right steps to manage it. This  is  the  value
of Diabetes Week, namely to  increase  awareness  of  the  disease  that  is
increasing in prevalence as the Minister pointed out. The IFP commends  this
initiative.
Nowadays most diabetics can be controlled by taking  tablets.  The  test  is
quick, simple and painless. People are realising how much  of  a  difference
simple lifestyle changes make to the entire course of the disease. Why  have
we made such good progress in handling diabetes?  Firstly,  there  has  been
constructive collaboration between the Government  and  the  drug  companies
that produce diabetic medication, such  as  with  Eli  Lilly  and  Novartis.
Secondly, because a  great  deal  of  money  has  been  spent  on  research.
Thirdly, because Government has  engaged  the  pharmaceutical  companies  to
bring down the cost of the medicines to the Government.

There are many parallels that could be drawn between  the  campaign  against
diabetes and that against HIV. Firstly, in  diabetes  the  stigma  has  been
removed. To do that, leaders, sports heroes  and  role  models  talk  freely
about their condition. Millions of South Africans  are  tested  openly,  and
they talk openly. They are not differentiated from anyone else  who  doesn't
have diabetes. Then there is no discrimination and  no  one  has  a  feeling
that there is a need for secrecy. The same  could  be  true  of  HIV  if  we
treated it in the same way.

Secondly, for prices to Government to be brought down and  medicines  to  be
made freely available, Government put out tenders,  and  as  a  result,  the
pharmaceutical companies provide medicines for diabetes at 30% of  the  cost
they are to the private sector. By contrast  look  at  Aids  medication,  we
have had much talk by Clinton on the need for cheaper prices.  There  was  a
court case against PMA over a law to give the  Minister  power  to  issue  a
compulsory licence for  generic  medicines.  Voluntary  licences  have  been
given to companies to produce generics. Offers of antiretrovirals have  been
made for the medicines to be free in the case of nevirapine.  Yet,  we  have
made no progress on the provision of cheaper medicines  for  HIV.  For  some
reasons, in HIV, the pharmaceutical companies were made the enemy  and  part
of the problem. In relation to diabetes they are part of the solution.

Research is essential if we want major technological breakthroughs, and  for
state of the art research we look to genetics and find that  here  right  in
UCT a gene has been identified for type one  diabetes  which  will  make  it
possible to immunise children against diabetes.

To the public, to minimise  the  problems  of  diabetes,  one  says  simply:
exercise, eat more  fruit  and  vegetables,  eat  less  sweets,  cooldrinks,
pastries, fried foods and refined starch. Eat more nuts, beans and  lentils.
If you can afford it, eat proteins such as meat, fish  and  eggs,  and  keep
your weight down.

To Government one  says:  Educate  the  public  by  working  with  the  drug
companies, put out tenders for medicines and invest in  research.  Fourthly,
if we want to lead by  example  -  as  I  do  by  getting  out  of  my  seat
frequently - we must ask the Deputy Minister to please put a good  gym  into
Parliament so that we can exercise and do  yoga,  pilatus,  bicycle  riding;
and even put a bicycle into the House so that we can take turns to  exercise
our bodies while we are exercising our minds. I hope the Deputy  Speaker  is
listening to my appeal on all of our behalves.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Order! Hon member, not only has your time  expired,  but
you don't  know  your  Parliament.  There  are  gyms,  and  they  are  fully
equipped. [Laughter.] I have received a note, hon  members,  asking  whether
it is parliamentary that all speakers should be thin and be talking as  they
like about people with fuller figures. [Laughter.]

Dr S J GOUS: Madam Deputy Speaker, diabetes is by  definition  an  excessive
thirst accompanied by excessive output. It comes from the Greek  word  which
literally means siphoning and ``mellitus'' which means sweetness  or  sugar.
Therefore, diabetes mellitus means siphoning sugar or sweetness.

At the end of 2001, it was estimated that 177  million  people  were  living
with diabetes worldwide. This figure is rising and we are  expecting  it  to
be 220 million by 2010. There are two main types of  diabetes,  namely  type
one,  which  is  a  genetic   disorder   characterised   by   young   onset,
autoantibodies and insulin dependency.

The implication is that the treatment is by injection,  and  in  the  future
the cure might lie with genetic  manipulation.  This  is  also  one  of  the
diseases that we as health workers  perpetuate.  Before  any  treatment  was
available, these patients usually died before puberty.  They  are  now  kept
alive and chances are that they will meet other diabetics, get  married  and
have children with a very high possibility of  also  having  this  type  one
diabetes.

Type two is characterised by later onset, obesity  and  insulin  resistance.
This is likened to  an  epidemic,  and  it's  referred  to  as  a  lifestyle
disease. It can be controlled and treated with  oral  medication,  lifestyle
changes and diet. It accounts for 85% to 95%  of  diabetes  in  the  Western
countries, and for  probably  more  in  the  developing  world.  It  uses  a
significant part of our health resources in  South  Africa,  and  there  are
about 1,5 million  South  Africans  suffering  from  the  disease.  That  is
between 5% and 10% of the population.

Contributing factors are ageing, sedentary  lifestyle,  poor  eating  habits
and obesity. The complications are vascular disease and it  leads  to  heart
disease, kidney disease and blindness. In fact, it's the most  common  cause
of blindness in adults.

The main message is  that  type  two  diabetes  is  largely  preventable  by
lifestyle intervention.  So  let's  get  off  our  fat  backsides,  do  some
exercise, eat properly and prevent the costly  disease  of  sugar  diabetes.
[Interjections.] Thank you.

Ms C DUDLEY:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  ACDP  applauds  efforts  by  the
Minister  and  her  department  to  create  awareness  around  diabetes  and
welcomes efforts during Diabetes Week by health facilities. We also  welcome
the public-private partnerships aimed at managing disease in all provinces.

Diabetes ranks third in South Africa  after  heart  disease  and  cancer  in
terms of  morbidity  and  mortality,  and  it  is  a  growing  problem.  The
prevalence in adults is 4% for whites, up to  8%  for  blacks  and  13%  for
Indians.

While changing eating habits and sedentary lifestyles could  be  the  reason
for the increase in diabetes; it is curious that this increase  is  in  both
rural and urban areas. We join the Minister of Health in  encouraging  South
Africans to value their health and pursue healthy lifestyles.

However, it  is  with  great  sadness  that  I  respond  to  the  Minister's
reference to Government support for and  promotion  of  the  termination  of
pregnancy. Government's lack of respect for life, demonstrated by the  legal
murder of  South  African  unborn  babies,  is  tragic  and  horrifying  and
undermines the health of our nation. Thank you.

Miss S RAJBALLY: Madam Deputy Speaker, it is not easy to be a  diabetic;  it
is a life-altering disease. The MF is concerned for  the  health  and  well-
being of our nation, and urges not only diabetic sufferers  but  noninfected
persons, too, to educate themselves on the prevention of  diabetes  and  how
to care for diabetics.

More importantly, the MF urges us as Parliament  to  embark  on  efforts  to
prevent diabetes because  of  our  rich  indulgence  in  snacks  that  cause
diabetes. Parliament's menus and refreshments should  receive  attention  to
ensure healthy meals for a healthy Parliament.

Diabetes kills and needs to be taken very seriously. It has  become  one  of
the most common problems that people from all walks  of  life  suffer  from.
The fact is that it can be prevented, in most instances.
The MF calls on the House, our citizenry and the world  to  acknowledge  the
effect of diabetes and make every effort to avoid it by choosing  a  healthy
lifestyle and healthy alternatives.

Thank you, hon Minister,  for  your  advice  on  how  to  control  diabetes.
Diabetes sufferers say, ``What can I do? If I don't eat, I shiver  but  when
I eat, I get sugar.'' Thank you very much. [Applause.]

The DEPUTY CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: Madam Deputy Speaker, as  one  of  the
members of the Indian community in South Africa with a very  high  incidence
of sugar diabetes, what I would like to say is that we need to take this  to
the schools and to our educational institutions. I recall that, having  been
advised about this problem many years ago, as a young person,  I  have  been
able to inculcate those good habits that the Minister spoke about with  good
and lasting health effects.

Children drink cool drinks and the tuck shops in our schools  sell  all  the
very sorts of things that the Minister asked us to be careful of. I  believe
that some sort of warning should be printed on cool  drink  bottles  because
in just one glass of cool drink there are about five to six, or even  up  to
seven teaspoonsful of sugar. But that's because we allow these things to  be
sold in the tuck shops to the children  who  acquire  the  taste  for  these
things, and then to ask them to reform and change  in  adult  life  is  very
very difficult indeed.

So, if we need to stem this problem, the best way to do so is  to  go  right
to the schools where children are beginning to  acquire  these  habits,  and
allow them to learn  to  have  habits  that  will  enable  them  to  protect
themselves in future. So, hon Minister, I wish to make a  very  very  strong
appeal to you to try and target the schools and the  tuck  shops  to  ensure
that the message that you are sending out to the nation as a whole  is  sent
out to the children. Because, it is when these  children  learn  to  acquire
the good habits that we can be certain that the future population  of  South
Africa will be able to protect itself against this menace.

And, by the way, I have just done my test, and my reading came out  as  4,9.
I am quite pleased with that. Thank you.
Dr E E JASSAT: Madam Deputy Speaker, firstly, I  would  like  to  thank  the
Minister for alerting us to this condition which is  so  prevalent  in  this
country. An estimated 90 000 people die daily from chronic,  noncommunicable
conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and asthma. Another  80
000 people die daily from HIV/Aids.

Globally, chronic conditions are on the rise and will  increasingly  present
a major public health challenge in the 21st  century.  A  chronic  condition
such  as  diabetes  will  not  only  be  the  leading  cause  of  disability
throughout the world by the year 2020, if not successfully managed  it  will
be the most expensive problem faced by our  health  care  systems.  In  this
respect, it poses a public health and economic  problem  to  all  countries,
including South Africa.

To complicate matters, many developing countries are  experiencing  dramatic
increases in chronic, noncommunicable conditions while  continuing  to  face
acute infectious diseases, malnutrition and poor maternal health.

Botswana is a prime example of this double  burden  of  disease.  Botswana's
HIV/Aids epidemic is well known. An estimated 33 000 people in Botswana  are
infected with HIV/Aids, including 39%  of  the  population  aged  15  to  49
years. What is  less  well  known  is  that  simultaneous  to  the  HIV/Aids
epidemic, Botswana's Ministry of Health is reporting a notable  increase  in
noncommunicable diseases  such  as  cancer,  hypertension  and,  of  course,
diabetes.

This double burden is placing new long-term  demands  on  Botswana's  health
care delivery system. To address the  changing  health  burden  of  disease,
Botswana's  Ministry  of  health  recently  created  a  team  dedicated   to
noncommunicable diseases, surveillance, prevention and control  -  something
we might also do in this country.

Similar trends can be seen in  India.  Although  India's  HIV/Aids  rate  is
relatively low and affects only 0,8% of the population aged 15 to 49  years,
due to India's large population, which is about a billion,  this  translates
into 3,8 million of the  population  of  the  age  group  infected.  India's
economic survey of 2001-02 recognised HIV/Aids as one of  the  most  serious
public  health  concerns  in  that  country,  while  at  the  same  time  an
epidemiological transition is under way which results  in  the  increase  in
noncommunicable diseases.

Deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases alone are projected  to  double  in
the  next  20  years.  And,  while  it  is  more  commonly   believed   that
noncommunicable diseases are more prevalent in higher  income  groups,  data
from India's national sample survey of 1995 showed that tobacco  intake  and
alcohol misuse are highest  in  the  poorest  20%  of  the  population.  The
prevalence of noncommunicable diseases is therefore  projected  to  increase
most rapidly in the lower socioeconomic groups in the coming years.

The incidence of diabetes is the highest in the South African Indian  ethnic
group. Prof Campbell, many years ago, stated that this was due to  the  high
consumption of sugar by the Indian group. He said that those  in  the  rural
areas would go to the cane fields and eat sugar  and  those  in  Durban  and
metropolitan areas would go to the takeaways and have sweetmeats  that  they
produce. This, however, has now been proved to be  incorrect.  It  has  been
shown that the high incidence of sugar diabetes amongst the Indian group  is
due to genetic factors. This has been made possible by the apartheid  system
which since 1913 prevented Indian brides from coming into this  country,  or
South  Africans  of  Indian  origin  marrying  into  another   group.   This
intermarrying has resulted in this high incidence of sugar diabetes.

The Minister has warned us about our intake of food, prevention  of  alcohol
consumption and smoking. She has also insisted that we should take to  daily
regular exercises. But I think, as a member has pointed  out,  this  message
must be transmitted to our schools and to our  young  people  who  now  have
taken to eating what they call ``junk food''. Of course, this  is  a  common
cause of the high incidence of obesity. It  is  now  being  recognised  that
these fast takeaways are contributing to the high incidence of  obesity  and
diabetes. We, in this country, must now take precaution and see to  it  that
our young  people  live  healthy  and  very  productive  lives.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

Debate concluded.

             STATEMENT BY THE SPEAKER ON PAN-AFRICAN PARLIAMENT

The SPEAKER: Deputy Speaker, hon members, though I bring good news I  don't,
unfortunately, have the final bit of good news which I had hoped would  have
arrived  before  now.  Let  me  explain:  Members  will  recall  that   last
September, a couple of months ago, when we debated  the  matter  of  African
unity and the Pan-African Parliament, I had indicated to the House  that  we
should begin to  prepare  for  the  inaugural  session  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament. I said then, and I repeat, that the  Pan-African  Parliament  is
no longer a matter for the distant future; it is no longer simply a  concept
or an idea about which Africa dreams and to which our people aspire - it  is
an immediate reality.

Therefore, the House can no longer afford to talk about it in the  abstract.
The debates can no longer be vague. We will  have  to  be  taking  decisions
about important issues in the very immediate future, certainly in  November,
if the Pan-African Parliament is to meet in January. Today  is  12  November
and the inaugural session will indeed be in January. I had hoped, as  I  had
indicated, to give you the exact date but we are still awaiting that.

The second ordinary summit of the African Union in Maputo had resolved  that
the process of ratification be expedited in order to enable  the  parliament
to meet before 31 January. The protocol requires ratification  by  a  simple
majority of  member  states  to  the  original  African  Economic  Community
Treaty, to which the protocol is attached. There are  only  47  states  that
are members of that treaty and, therefore, 24 instruments are  required.  As
of today, Algeria, Botswana, Burkina  Faso,  Egypt,  Ethiopia,  the  Gambia,
Lesotho, Libya,  Malawi,  Mali,  Mozambique,  Namibia,  Niger,  Rwanda,  the
Sahrawari Democratic  Republic,  Seychelles,  Sierra  Leone,  South  Africa,
Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe have ratified.

Tomorrow, we expect Senegal to deposit its instrument of ratification  which
will bring the protocol into force within 30 days, that is  13  December.  A
number of other parliaments have advised us that they have ratified or  done
their part, and their heads of state will be depositing the  instruments  in
the next few weeks - that is four or five more  ratifications.  Now,  it  is
the intention of the commission to convene the inaugural session before  the
end of January. Thus, the Pan-African Parliament will be established  within
the timeframes set by the Maputo summit, which had resolved that  it  should
meet before 31 January.

That same resolution stressed the importance of setting up this  organ,  and
I quote:


  ... which will ensure the effective and full participation of the African
  peoples in the development and integration of the continent.

Meeting those timeframes and the first organ to be established  within  that
resolution is a major achievement for our continent, but  it  also  poses  a
major challenge for us. As the  Parliament  of  South  Africa,  we  need  to
prepare for that inaugural session and we need to give  serious  thought  to
what we do as part of those African peoples to make that  institution  serve
its purpose, to make it a true parliament, and to ensure that  it  functions
in a way that ensures the participation of our  people  in  the  development
and integration of the continent.

Immediately, we are going to have to elect five members of  this  Parliament
to represent us. This election will need to take place within the  next  two
weeks. We have to determine how that election will be undertaken and how  we
will compose our five representatives. Now, I  want  to  draw  attention  to
article 4(2) of the protocol, which makes it clear that the  representatives
of each parliament must reflect the diversity of political  opinions  within
it. At least, one of the five has to be a woman. Our Parliament has  already
resolved that three of our five representatives will be women.

So, what is the process we put in place to  ensure  that  we  have  a  fully
representative delegation? Immediately when we elect the five  members  from
this Parliament we have to determine how that election  will  be  undertaken
and, as I said, how we will compose the five representatives.

I want to stress that the emphasis  on  the  representivity  is  taken  very
seriously by the commission and by the heads of state. The African Union  is
unique among multilateral institutions in committing itself to  full  gender
equality in its appointments. And starting with the  commission  itself,  it
has ensured that 50% of the 10  commissioners,  namely  five,  are  in  fact
women. That was the decision made in Maputo, and the appointments were  made
accordingly.

For  the  Pan-African  Parliament   a   credentials   committee   is   being
established. That committee will not accredit any representation  that  does
not conform  with  the  stipulated  requirements  of  gender  and  political
diversity. My understanding of this is that all five  representatives  would
be rejected if there is not at least one woman amongst the five. And if  the
political diversity of the parliament is not reflected among the  five.  So,
a procedure that will secure  that  outcome  is  required.  Obviously,  each
parliament will have to determine its own procedure.

We also have to consider other limitations in the protocol in terms  of  who
can be elected. Now I know that a number of members  of  the  executive  are
here, and I regret to inform you that the protocol does not allow  that  you
be elected to represent  this  Parliament  in  the  Pan-African  Parliament.
[Interjections.] You may, of course, be part of government delegations  that
will come and account.

Another item that we have to consider  is  what  kind  of  oath  of  office.
Before the end of this week we  will  be  receiving  draft  oaths  from  the
commission, which will be submitted to the AU working group  of  this  House
to consider, and it will report to us on its recommendations.  We  will,  of
course, have to agree as an entire continental group as  to  what  the  oath
will be, but we ourselves will be able to make an input into the draft  that
I submitted.

The Pan-African Parliament would need  to  choose  from  amongst  themselves
five presiding officers: a president  and  four  vice-presidents.  One  will
have to come from each region. Here again, there is a need for  a  mechanism
for that selection. But, I believe there are principles  which  need  to  be
linked to the procedure. Is it our view that each of the five  regions  will
simply nominate somebody? In other words, that  we  will  have  a  group  of
presiding officers who will represent regions, or is it that  we  desire  an
outcome where the Pan-African Parliament will have five  presiding  officers
who, individually and collectively, will  speak  on  behalf  of  the  entire
continent? In other words, on behalf of that entire parliament? In my  view,
I would commend the latter, and, therefore, we have to find a mechanism  for
selection that will allow  each  one  of  the  members  of  the  Pan-African
Parliament to vote for each  one  of  the  five  representatives.  In  other
words, we should not have a system  where  a  region  simply  nominates  one
person whom the Pan-African Parliament endorses.

How then do we provide for that  representation?  That  is  a  challenge.  I
understand the commission will be  submitting  alternatives  which  we  will
need to look at, but we can make our own input into that.  Now  I  spoke  of
five regions, one of the issues we have  to  look  into  is  that  the  five
regions do not include SADC. We have become  accustomed  to  the  view  that
SADC is where we belong on a continental scale. Creating or working on  this
parliament has been an educative exercise. SADC is  an  economic  community,
and it is not a unit of the African Union, nor was it  of  the  Organisation
of African Unity. Southern  Africa,  in  terms  of  the  African  Union,  is
smaller than SADC. So, one of the issues we have to look at is how  we  will
choose those five presiding officers, or make our choice amongst them.

The Southern Africa region has 10 members only, that  is  Angola,  Botswana,
Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa,  Swaziland,  Zambia  and
Zimbabwe. Amongst those excluded, we have the Democratic Republic of  Congo,
which now has  a  parliament,  Seychelles,  Tanzania,  and  I  think  it  is
Mauritius, so it is smaller than SADC, which we are used to.

Now  the  challenge  posed  by  the  variation  between  the  five   regions
recognised by the OAU, and now by the  AU,  and  the  14  regional  economic
communities that have been established, is one of the  priorities  that  the
commission intends to address. There is an expectation that the  Pan-African
Parliament will have to assist in  this  process,  but  that  happens  after
January, and our focus is on what we do before January.

I have already indicated that what we need to do is to  elect  our  members,
but we need to look at the oath and at mechanisms,  and  a  whole  range  of
issues which in the next few days will be submitted to every  parliament  on
the continent by  the  commission  of  the  African  Union.  Now  what  this
requires of us is that every member here, and  those  not  here,  and  every
political party have to ensure that our inputs are  made  on  all  of  these
issues before the five representatives go to Addis Ababa for  the  inaugural
session.

This can be done through the working group that we have established, and  to
which all the documents we receive  will  be  submitted.  It  will  have  to
consider the documents and make appropriate recommendations  on  which  this
House will have to take decisions - certainly before the last week  of  this
session.

Hon members, membership of the working group is large, and  it  is  open  to
any member, even members of the executive, to attend and make inputs  there.
Regrettably very few members do attend. I would urge,  and  I  have  already
spoken to the Chief Whips to ensure this, that in the next two  meetings  at
least there is very, very full  representation  so  that  we  can  make  our
collective views known there, and thus  empower  our  five  representatives,
whom we still have to choose, to make an input into that  inaugural  session
of the Pan-African Parliament.

That is what we have to determine, that is up  to  this  House  and  to  the
NCOP, because it is  our  Parliament  that  will  be  represented,  not  the
National Assembly alone. So, that is the challenge before  us.  I  trust  we
will meet it so that  we  will  be  truly  represented  in  the  Pan-African
Parliament. I thank you. [Applause.]

        CONSIDERATION OF REPORT OF PORTFOLIO COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND
    CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON JUDICIAL MATTERS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL

There was no debate.

Mr S K Louw, on behalf of the Chief Whip of the Majority Party, moved:  That
the report be adopted.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

                   JUDICIAL MATTERS SECOND AMENDMENT BILL
                           (Second Reading debate)

The MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Madam  Deputy
Speaker, thanks very much.

As is the practice with Bills of this nature, the  Judicial  Matters  Second
Amendment Bill comprises a number of amendments to laws administered  by  my
department. As a matter of fact, a total of 16 Acts  were  amended  in  this
Bill. The amendments do not require individual amending  Acts.  They  mainly
address certain problem areas which have arisen in  practice.  However,  the
Bill does also contain certain amendments, which are of a  more  substantial
nature, some of which deserve mentioning.

The first one is to section 35B of the  Insolvency  Act,  which  deals  with
agreements on informal markets. The amendments to this  section  will  allow
for agreements that provide for the termination  and  netting  of  specified
obligations. This will  strengthen  the  country's  financial  relationships
with international banks and securities  firms  operating  in  South  Africa
which, in turn, can only benefit the country as a whole.
The second amendment is  an  insertion  of  an  additional  section  in  the
Criminal Procedure Act, which  will  give  the  complainant  in  a  criminal
matter the right to make representations in  the  case  of  certain  serious
offences when the placement of  the  accused  in  question  on  parole,  day
parole or under correctional supervision is considered at a meeting  of  the
parole board. This insertion will allow a victim to be part of the decision-
making process when the issue  of  parole  or  correctional  supervision  is
considered by the parole board.

The Bill makes an  amendment  to  the  Attorneys  Act  which  will  make  it
compulsory for all newly admitted attorneys, whether they are practising  as
partners in an existing firm of attorneys or whether they are practising  on
their own account, to complete a  legal  practice  management  course.  This
will assist new lawyers and provide them with management and  administrative
skills.

The Bill also amends the Mediation  in  Certain  Divorce  Matters  Act,  the
Maintenance  Act  and  the  Domestic  Violence  Act,  which  amendments  are
intended to allow family advocates to carry out investigations  with  regard
to the welfare of minor or dependent children in maintenance  enquiries,  as
well as in domestic violence proceedings in certain circumstances.

These amendments  will,  in  effect,  extend  the  current  role  of  family
advocates, which has, to date, been limited  to  interventions  in  divorce-
related proceedings. These amendments will contribute to the  protection  of
children's interests in cases in which their parents are often  involved  in
personal struggles against each other to the detriment of their offspring.

The following amendment relates to the Promotion of  Access  to  Information
Act, which currently contains no criminal sanction  for  public  or  private
bodies that fail to produce a manual, as required in terms  of  the  Act.  A
provision has now been added  in  terms  of  which  either  the  information
officer, in the case of a public body, or the head of  a  private  body  can
face a fine or imprisonment of up to two years if he or she fails to  comply
with the requirements of this Act with regard to the submission of manuals.

This Act is intended to promote a culture of openness and transparency  and,
of course, easy access to information.  These  amendments  are  intended  to
make  sure  that  public  and  private  bodies  make  information  available
regarding their role, function and records, among other things.  Failure  to
do so will bring them into conflict with the law.

These are just a few of the amendments contained  in  the  Bill.  There  are
many more that  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  the  administration  of
justice,  in  some  way  or  another.  Most  of  them  are,  however,  self-
explanatory and the memorandum on the objects of the Bill, accompanying  the
draft legislation, is quite comprehensive. It sets out in some  detail  what
is envisaged with each and every proposed amendment.

May I thank the portfolio committee and,  in  particular,  its  chairperson,
Adv Johnny de Lange, a member of  this  House,  for  the  work  of  sterling
quality they did in processing this Bill. I thank you. [Applause.]
Adv J H DE LANGE: Madam Deputy Speaker, hon Ministers, hon members,  I  rise
on this occasion, again, to unconditionally support all  the  amendments  to
this legislation.

Let me start with some thank yous, starting with the Minister,  once  again,
for his guidance  and  oversight  on  the  matters;  then,  particularly  Mr
Lawrence Bassett and  Miss  Naidoo,  from  the  Department  of  Justice  and
Constitutional Development, who did sterling work to  make  sure  that  this
Bill would come before the House; and, of course, most importantly, my long-
suffering committee.

I think they have not worked out that in terms of the way  democracy  works,
if you don't like the Chair you can actually nominate another one,  and  you
can vote and actually get rid of this  Chair.  I  was  worrying  during  the
recess of six weeks - when we sat - that someone would  remember  that,  but
no one did. They worked through the recess to make sure that this  Bill  and
other Bills would be are ready for this Parliament to pass. I thank  all  of
them, in particular the opposition parties, for  working  so  diligently  in
enabling us to process this legislation and other legislation.

This is what we call a ``rommelkas'' [an omnibus] Bill in Afrikaans  -  ``'n
rommelkaswet'' [an omnibus Act]. One takes a whole  lot  of  Acts  and  then
amend them with one Bill. I think there are 15 pieces of  legislation  being
amended in this one Bill. Some of the amendments are  just  technical  ones,
but others are of  immense  importance,  and  some  of  my  colleagues  will
elaborate on those amendments today - explain what they are all about.

The Deputy Chief Whip of my party reminded me that one must  be  careful  of
these ``rommelkaswette'', because  the  180-day  detention  law,  which  was
passed many years ago by the apartheid Parliament, was  slipped  in  through
one of these ``rommelkaswette''. Now, I can assure  this  House  that  there
isn't a 180-day detention law in this legislation, but other very  important
pieces of legislation are being amended.

One of those is the Administration Amendment  Act.  This,  you  will  recall
from a while back, used to be called the Black Administration Act  -  it  is
one of those infamous pieces of legislation that we still have not  got  rid
of from the Statute Book. In terms of that  legislation,  our  department  a
few years ago looked at the sections which dealt with black  divorce  courts
and transformed those courts into courts that  can  be  used  by  the  whole
population, while retaining them as divorce courts. These courts  have  been
tremendously successful and have created access also  for  other  population
groups, and have been very popular in this regard.

However, the clause that deals with the appointment mechanism -  although  I
do not think that there is anything  wrong  with  this  clause  -  has  been
interpreted as not allowing the Minister  to  make  acting  appointments.  I
don't think so, because the clause just states that the  Minister  can  make
appointments of any fit and proper person; the clause  doesn't  say  whether
they should be acting or permanent.

Therefore, although the department wanted to introduce a deeming  clause  so
that all acting appointments would therefore have been legal  in  the  past,
our feeling was that this was not a good thing to  do.  Certainly  it  would
not actually deal with the problem if anyone wanted to challenge it, and  we
should feel confident in ourselves that this clause does  provide  for  both
permanent and acting appointments.

So, what we have done, in any case, is amend the clause now to make it  very
clear that, in future, permanent appointments may be made in  terms  of  the
one  clause.  We  have  also  included  a  clause  that  allows  for  acting
appointments, and that will be done in the same manner as with magistrates.

Of course, as you know, these courts have not  been  rationalised  into  the
present court system. That  is  also  why  the  appointment  mechanisms  are
different  from  magistrates'  courts.  Therefore  we  have  also  passed  a
resolution  in  that  we  feel  the  department  should  very  soon  try  to
rationalise these courts into the court system so that we don't  have  these
kinds of problems, because, as has been pointed out, these courts have  been
tremendously successful on the ground,  giving  ordinary  people  access  to
courts, particularly on divorce matters.

The Minister has mentioned the amendment to section 35B  of  the  Insolvency
Act.  This  is  an  incredibly  complicated  clause.  When  the  clause  was
introduced, nobody could understand what it  meant.  I  think  it  was  very
badly written. It was, in fact,  done  by  the  banking  sector  themselves.
After sitting down with them for a long time and on many occasions, we  were
able to work out what exactly was needed.

This clause, as I said, is very complex and really  deals  with  when  banks
from this country enter into agreements with banks in other  countries,  and
what would happen if one of those banks were to go insolvent, how  one  then
terminated these agreements, and how one met the unperformed obligations  or
any assets that have been  put  forward  as  collateral  for  the  different
agreements. A whole procedure is set out on what to  do  in  that  instance.
That is about as much as I understand about it. I  think  we  now  have  the
right clause to explain this. In any case, the banking sector is  enormously
happy, and we will see  how  they  respond  during  the  election  campaign.
That's only a joke. [Laughter.]

Then, also, we have made numerous amendments to the Promotion of  Access  to
Information Act. These are vital amendments, and  we  did  at  the  time  of
passing the Bill say that there  were  very  many  technical  problems  that
would come forth as  we  implemented  this  Act.  Some  of  these  technical
problems we are now dealing with. For example, the Minister  mentioned  that
both public bodies and private bodies have to publish  a  manual  that  sets
out how they deal with access to  information.  Now,  with  the  regulations
that were drafted in this regard, there were  three  requirements:  firstly,
that you publish in the Government Gazette; secondly, that  you  publish  it
on your Internet site, if you have one; and, thirdly, you also  give  it  to
your professional body if you belong to one so that they have it available.

It quickly transpired that there were  enormous  problems  with  publication
for private bodies - this includes  companies  of  which  there  are  a  few
hundred thousand in this country. Firstly, if they all had to publish  their
manual in the Government Gazette, this would be very costly.  Secondly,  the
Government Gazette couldn't cope - there were piles of  documents  that  had
to be dealt with. So we amended the regulations to  deal  with  that  issue,
but, in the process, the Minister knows, we also found that  some  companies
just said, ``There is no sanction in this legislation. So, if  there  is  no
sanction, we couldn't care less; we won't do what the law has  prescribed.''
They did not have a positive attitude to this.

We did note when we passed the legislation that  we  weren't  providing  for
sanctions, because we wanted to treat people as adults. We  wanted  to  give
them  the  opportunity  to  actually  deal  with  this   legislation   being
implemented without sanctions. It is very clear that this is  not  possible.
Although we have changed this now in that you do not have to  publish  these
manuals in the Government Gazette, we have also now provided  for  sanctions
in the legislation in this regard, and then also through the regulations.

We have also had to extend, both in this Act and in the Promotion of  Access
to Justice Act, the period in which the rules have to  be  drafted  so  that
those applications can be brought in the lower courts and not  in  the  High
Courts where they are brought now. We've also extended the period  in  which
the Human Rights Commission has to publish the overall  manual  for  dealing
with the promotion of access to justice in the legislation.

The department also suggested that we make an amendment  to  section  79  of
the Criminal Procedure Act. This is the Act that deals  with  the  panel  of
psychiatrists that has to be appointed for the purposes  of  enquiring  into
the capacity  of  an  accused  person.  This  clause  has  created  enormous
problems in practice. Firstly, the panel of psychiatrists  and  the  tariffs
that have been provided have not allowed  many  of  these  psychiatrists  to
actually do this work.  This  piece  of  legislation  has  created  enormous
problems.

However, we were not in a position  to  actually  make  amendments  to  this
clause, because there were too many outstanding  issues.  We  have  referred
this clause  back  to  the  department  to  consult  particularly  with  the
Department of Health and the Department of Safety and Security in  order  to
find new solutions as to how we deal with this problem,  and  not  to  dream
these up in the committee. Therefore, this clause has been referred back  to
the department to do  the  necessary  consultations,  and  that  has  to  be
introduced in due course.

I think there's also a very important clause, which my colleagues will  talk
about, that deals with the role of victims when it comes to the question  of
whether certain types of criminals have to be given parole. This is a  whole
new clause that empowers victims, and I suggest that  you  have  a  look  at
this.

Lastly, we have introduced a very important clause regarding the problem  of
trials of awaiting-trial prisoners not beginning for years. We found that  a
certain two accused in the Eastern Cape had been  sitting  in  prison  since
1997, with their trial still not having begun, which  is  very  problematic.
We have now given the Minister a clause dealing with public prosecutions  in
terms of which we, as Parliament, receive  reports  from  time  to  time  on
awaiting-trial prisoners, and the reasons why those trials have  not  begun.
I hope that  this  will  help  all  of  us  manage  that  aspect  and  help,
particularly, the police make this much better.

There are a whole lot of other clauses that my colleagues will deal with.  I
thank you once again and I do appreciate the support for  this  legislation.
Thank you. [Applause.]

Mrs S  M  CAMERER:  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  Judicial  Matters  Second
Amendment Bill is a compendium, as the chair has said, of  mostly  technical
amendments, which are not controversial. I join the chair  in  thanking  the
officials  for  a  job  well  done.  This  Bill  also  includes  some   very
substantive improvements to our criminal law and procedure, which are to  be
welcomed. Accordingly, the DA supports the Bill.

However, we wish to particularly emphasise our support for the insertion  of
section 299A into the Criminal  Procedure  Act,  which  will  at  last  give
victims of serious violent crime the right to be  heard  when  it  comes  to
paroling the perpetrator. This is an important reform measure as far as  our
criminal law is concerned.

During my years as a member of Parliament, I've  been  approached  often  by
outraged victims of assault, rape and so on  and  by  their  closest  family
members, complaining that they have been ignored by  the  authorities  while
the perpetrator of the crime, of which they fell victim, had  been  paroled.
This is a further step down the road to empowering victims of crime, and  is
therefore welcomed by the DA. It is a step for which we have campaigned  for
some years  as  part  of  our  campaign  to  give  victims  of  crime  legal
recognition. [Interjections.]

In terms of this  reform  measure,  when  a  court  sentences  a  person  to
imprisonment for murder, rape, robbery, assault, sexual assault,  kidnapping
or an act of terrorism and so on, it must inform the victim or  complainant,
or, in the case of murder, the relatives of the deceased victim,  that  they
have a right to  make  representations  when  placement  on  parole  of  the
prisoner or perpetrator is considered.

They must give their details to the Commissioner  of  Correctional  Services
who, in turn, must pass them on to the parole board. How this will  work  in
practice is  difficult  to  envisage,  particularly  in  the  case  of  long
sentences for serious violent crime. It might well be that both  the  victim
and the perpetrator have moved from  youth  to  old  age  by  the  time  the
provision becomes relevant. But what is  important  is  that  the  principle
that the victim has a role in paroling perpetrators has  now  been  accepted
into our law.

Another reform measure to be welcomed  is  the  twice-yearly  report  to  be
tabled in Parliament by the National Director of Public Prosecutions on  the
number of awaiting-trial prisoners who have been held in jail for more  than
a  year  without  their  trial  commencing.  The  number  of  awaiting-trial
prisoners in our jails - some 60 000 at  present-  is  an  ongoing  scandal.
These prisoners clog up prisons so that at  present  190 000  prisoners  are
being kept in facilities designed for 120 000.

The oversight visits around the country by the Justice  portfolio  committee
revealed appalling abuses of human rights, including cases  in  which  women
and children, as mentioned by  our  chairperson,  had  been  held  for  long
periods awaiting trial for relatively minor offences.

These cases will no longer remain hidden from  parliamentary  scrutiny,  and
we will be able to regularly demand answers and take steps. Hopefully,  this
will improve the shocking inhumanitarian conditions in which so many of  our
prisoners are kept.

A further reform measure I would  like  to  highlight  is  the  new  section
60(3), which legislates for a pretrial services report to be  considered  in
bail hearings. Where they were introduced, as pilot  projects  at  Mitchells
Plain and Johannesburg magistrates' courts with funding  from  the  American
Vera Institute, pretrial services worked  excellently  in  keeping  indigent
minor offenders who are unable to pay low amounts of bail out of jail.

This excellent system in which probation officers, community  organisations,
communities and families are given roles in the criminal justice  system  to
monitor and ensure that the offender comes to court on the day  his  or  her
case is to be heard, worked very well. There was a very  low  failure  rate.
Inexplicably, when the foreign funds  dried  up,  the  project  was  dropped
instead of the Justice department finding the funds within  its  own  budget
to continue and expand the system.

The DA believes that this decision was wrong, particularly in light  of  the
large number of awaiting-trial prisoners who are minor  offenders,  but  who
are languishing in jail merely because  they  are  too  poor  to  pay  small
amounts of bail. Judge Fagan estimates that there are some 20 000  of  them.
The Justice department should make every  effort  to  ensure  that  pretrial
services are available at all our major court centres.

Other amendments to be welcomed are the provisions  giving  a  role  to  the
family advocate, where  available,  in  maintenance  and  domestic  violence
cases in order that the welfare of minor or dependent children  be  properly
taken into account. The DA also has no  problem  with  the  other  technical
amendments already mentioned by previous speakers.

As a member of the Judicial Service  Commission,  I  agree  that  the  JSC's
deliberations when considering whether to appoint someone as a judge  should
remain confidential  and  be  excluded  from  the  Promotion  of  Access  to
Information Act. After all, all the other processes of the  appointment  are
held in public.

In conclusion, this judicial matters Bill tidies up a number of  aspects  of
our law, but it is not, in spite of its title, designed to  tackle  some  of
the root causes of the malaise that afflicts the administration  of  justice
in our country. Some of these were highlighted  this  week  in  a  statement
published in the media by Mr Danie Olivier, a member of the North  West  Law
Society and head of its own legal aid project, Legali.

When the organised legal profession's elected representatives criticise  the
state of justice administration in our courts, they should be  listened  to.
Mr Olivier levelled three serious accusations  at  the  Justice  department,
namely that government departments  and  entities  are  not  complying  with
court orders against them. The main  culprit  here,  he  fingered,  was  the
state attorney, which does not ensure that  orders  are  complied  with.  Mr
Olivier points out that the Supreme Court of Appeal and  the  Constitutional
Court have been critical of Government for this.

Another point made by Mr Olivier is that state law advisers  are  guilty  of
poor legal drafting.  No  member  of  the  Justice  portfolio  committee  in
Parliament would disagree with that, as we have to redraft  virtually  every
Bill that comes before us. He also pointed a finger at the poor standard  of
judgments coming from magistrates, something which has also been  criticised
by the High Courts.
It  is  in  the  power  of  the  Minister  for  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development to do something about all this. Hopefully, he will try to do  so
before he bows out next year, if this is truly  his  intention.  Perhaps  he
will tell us when he replies to the debate whether this is indeed so.  There
is no excuse for government departments to fail or be dilatory in  complying
with court orders.

The fast-tracking of affirmative action appointments with inadequate  skills
and training are among  the  reasons  for  the  other  problems  Mr  Olivier
pointed  out,  and  could  easily  be  remedied  with   intensive   training
programmes which, of course, require resources. While  the  Justice  College
does a great job, its head constantly complains about the lack of  resources
preventing the college from fulfilling its mandate.

All these amendments and reforms of the law in this Bill are well and  good.
However, as the DA constantly points out, without  adequate  resourcing  and
in the almost 10 years of ANC  rule,  the  Justice  department  and  related
departments have  been  starved  of  funds,  as  the  Minister  himself  has
acknowledged on occasion. Delivery of a better standard of justice is  still
a pipe dream. Thank you.

Mr T E VEZI: Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.  As  previously  indicated  by
the Minister and the chairperson, this Bill contains a number of  amendments
to laws  administered  by  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development.  The  amendments  mainly  address   problems   encountered   in
practice, but some amendments are of a more substantial nature.

Bearing that in mind, I can only refer to a few  amendments.  Regarding  the
amendment providing for termination  and  netting,  the  memorandum  on  the
objects of this Bill notes that there was concern that  the  application  of
the present section 35B of the  Insolvency  Act  -  agreements  on  informal
markets - was too wide and that this may present  many  international  banks
and securities firms, who operate in South Africa,  from  taking  on  larger
financial exposure.

Thus, the amendment provides that once liquidation proceedings  have  begun,
involving a party  to  a  master  agreement,  all  unperformed  obligations,
either in  terms  of  a  master  agreement  or  obligations  in  respect  of
collateral assets where ownership was transferred as a collateral  security,
are terminated, with the unperformed obligations then calculated  at  market
value.

The amendment also  provides,  in  this  instance,  that  dispositions  made
without value cannot be set aside  except  where  they  are  the  result  of
collusive transactions and fraudulent dispositions.

Regarding the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  Act  51  of  1977,  section  60(2)
provides for the court's powers in any  bail  hearing.  The  amendment  will
compel the courts to take into account pretrial  reports,  where  available,
during bail proceedings. The purpose of  a  pretrial  report  is  to  assist
courts in making a decision  regarding  the  desirability  of  releasing  an
accused on bail.

There is also an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act which  is  intended
to create certainty, confirming that correctional supervision  is  indeed  a
sentencing  option  in  the  case  of  an  offence  whether  common  law  or
statutory.
With regard to section 299 of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  the  amendment
provides that where an accused is convicted of certain serious  crimes,  the
court  must  inform  the  complainant,  or,  in  the  case  of  murder,  the
deceased's relatives who are present at the trial, that they  have  a  right
to make representations or attend the hearing at which parole or day  parole
of the prisoner is considered.

The provision in terms of the Attorneys Act, Act 53 of 1979, aims to  reduce
the number of claims  against  attorneys  that  arise  on  account  of  poor
management and administration skills.

In terms of the Divorce  Act  of  1979,  the  Bill  places  a  duty  on  the
registrar to cause endorsement to be  noted  as  soon  as  possible  on  the
records of the pension fund.

With reference to the Domestic Violence Act, Act 116 of 1998, the  amendment
is intended to eliminate any uncertainty  about  whether  administrators  of
pension funds can be ordered to make payment in terms of  section  16(2)  of
the Maintenance Act. The amendment allows for enforcement of  a  maintenance
order made under the Maintenance Act by way of execution. This ensures  that
provision is also applicable to maintenance orders  that  are  made  by  the
High Court and the divorce court.

Regarding section 10 of the Promotion of Access to Information Act of  2000,
the amendment extends the amount of  time  in  which  the  SA  Human  Rights
Commission has  to  compile  a  guide  in  each  official  language  on  the
information required by a person who wishes to exercise any right  contained
in the Promotion of Access  to  Information  Act.  Section  90  of  the  Act
provides  for  penalties  should  the  relevant  public  or  private  person
wilfully or out of gross  negligence  fail  to  comply  with  the  requisite
manuals within the designated timeframes.

Regarding the Promotion of Administrative Justice  Act,  the  definition  of
administrative  action  is  extended  at  (gg)  to  include  not  only   the
appointment of a judicial officer, but also the nomination and selection  of
a judicial officer or any other person by the commission.

In  terms  of  the  Promotion  of  Equality   and   Prevention   of   Unfair
Discrimination Act, the  amendment  provides  that  any  alteration  to  the
boundaries of an equality court will not affect  the  status  of  any  legal
proceedings that have already been instituted but not yet completed.

In terms of the Judges' Remuneration and Conditions of Employment  Act,  the
amendment addresses the position of surviving spouses of judges who  retired
under  the  Judges'  Pensions  Act,  Act  90  of  1978.  When  applying  the
provisions of the Judges' Remuneration and  Conditions  of  Employment  Act,
the  National  Treasury  encountered  the  problem  that  these   particular
surviving  spouses  would  receive  less  than  what  they  were   currently
receiving. The amendment attempts to address  this  problem,  adjusting  the
amount to be paid to such pensioners and providing that  the  amount  cannot
be less than that which he or she received before any  adjustment  was  made
under this subsection. Having mentioned those amendments, the  IFP  supports
the Bill. I thank you.

Ms I MUTSILA: Mufarela Mulangadzulo wa Mufumakadzi [Deputy Speaker], one  of
the main objectives of this Bill is that it seeks to reform the  maintenance
systems in order to cater for  the  welfare  of  children  and  persons  who
become victims of circumstances in this regard.
Section 16 of the Maintenance Act of 1998 can possibly be considered  to  be
its heart, since it deals  with  maintenance  orders  and  the  powers  that
maintenance courts have in this respect. The  subsection,  in  other  words,
provides for what is often referred to as a garnish order in terms of  which
the  courts  direct  the  employer  of  the  father  who   has   maintenance
obligations to pay the maintenance money from the salary of  such  a  father
directly to the maintenance beneficiary. This is  nothing  new  or  unusual.
The previous Maintenance Act of 1963 also provided for these. However,  when
the 1963 Maintenance Act was revisited and,  in  fact,  rewritten  in  1998,
this concept was broadened in order to ensure that it is used  to  its  full
potential,  and  takes  into  account  changed   circumstances   of   social
realities.

One of these social realities is that a  large  number  of  persons  against
whom maintenance orders are made nowadays are not employees  in  the  strict
sense of the word, but are self-employed and  receive  money  on  a  regular
basis from other sources. Examples of these abound:  investments  which  are
paid to persons  on  a  regular  basis,  pensions  which  are  paid  out  to
pensioners each month, moneys which are paid to persons out of  trust  funds
and so the list goes on.

Recognising  these  changed  circumstances  and   social   realities,   this
Parliament in 1998 gave life to section  16(2)  in  its  present  form.  Any
person who has a contractual obligation to  pay  money  to  a  person  on  a
regular basis can be directed by the maintenance court to pay  all  or  part
of the money to a maintenance beneficiary on behalf of  the  person  against
whom the maintenance order has been made. There is, however, a condition  to
this power. Before making such a maintenance order,  the  maintenance  court
must ensure that it is practicable to do so.

Why do we need to amend this laudable provision? The answer can be found  in
the judgment of a high court in the case of the  State  vs  Botha.  In  this
case when  the  Government  Employees  Pension  Fund  was  directed  by  the
maintenance court to pay maintenance on behalf of Mr Botha  who  received  a
pension from that pension fund, the fund argued in the court that  it  could
not give effect to this on the strength of the provision in  the  Government
Employees Pensions Law of 1996, which prohibits  the  assignments,  transfer
or cession of any pension benefits.

Because of the uncertainty surrounding the application of this  section,  as
is evidenced from the Botha case, Parliament has seen fit to  amend  it  and
to refer specifically to administrators of  pension  funds  in  the  section
itself. In practice, pension funds are the mostly likely targets  for  these
types of maintenance order. The amendment will not only eliminate any  legal
uncertainty as seems to have cropped up in the Botha case. But it will  also
focus the attention of judicial officers on the fact that pension funds  can
be put to use in this  way,  namely  for  the  benefit  of  the  maintenance
beneficiaries, most of whom are children.

I intend talking about two amendments contained in the Bill, both which  are
proposed subsections to our  Criminal  Procedure  Act  of  1977.  The  first
amendment provides the complainant in a criminal  case,  or  let's  say  the
victim in a criminal case, with the right to have a say when it  becomes  to
a decision by a parole board on whether to let the accused  person  in  that
case go out on parole or be placed under correctional supervision.

In  1997,  Parliament  enacted  the  Parole  and  Correctional   Supervision
Amendment Act. This Act inserted a  new  section  64C  in  the  Correctional
Services Act of 1959, which, in many respects, is the same as the  provision
I  am  talking  about.  However,  this  section  64C  was,  however,   never
implemented, because around the same time,  the  new  Correctional  Services
Act of 1998 was in the process of being drafted.  During  this  process,  it
was felt that a provision  of  this  nature  fits  better  in  the  Criminal
Procedure Act.

There are a few aspects  of  this  clause  which  I  think  deserve  special
mention. In the first place, victims of crime should  be  at  court  if  and
when sentence is handed down to an  accused  person.  This  is  because  the
clause requires a court, when sentencing an accused person,  to  inform  any
victim if he or she is  present,  that  he  or  she  has  a  right  to  make
presentations whenever placement of the prisoner on parole,  on  day  parole
or other correctional supervision is considered; or to attend  any  relevant
meeting of the parole board.
It is also important to note that  this  right  only  exist  in  respect  of
certain serious  offences,  particularly  those  which  could  have  a  very
personal effect on a victim or a relative  of  a  victim;  such  as  murder,
rape, robbery, assault of a sexual nature and kidnapping.

While this right has been given to victims of crime, the clause also  places
certain duties on them which must be complied with.  They  must  inform  the
Commissioner of Correctional Services in writing that they wish to  exercise
this right. They must provide  the  commissioner  with  their  physical  and
postal address. This clause represents a step in the right direction as  far
as victims of crime are concerned. I sincerely hope that the public  becomes
aware of it and uses it to its fullest potential.

The second clause I  wish  to  highlight  places  a  duty  on  the  National
Director of Public Prosecutions to have a report tabled in Parliament  twice
every year. This report  must  contain  prescribed  particulars  of  accused
persons whose trials have not commenced, and who have been  in  custody  for
certain periods of time.

These periods of time differ depending on the court where the  trial  is  to
be conducted. If the case is to be conducted in a High Court, the NDPP  must
provide particulars if the accused person has been in custody for  a  period
longer than 18 months and his or her trial has not  yet  commenced.  In  the
case of the regional court the period is 12 months, and in  the  case  of  a
district court the period is six months.

The question may be asked: Why is this necessary?  The  Portfolio  Committee
on Justice and Constitutional Development on  its  oversight  visit  to  the
courts has come across quite a few cases of accused persons  who  have  been
in custody for lengthy periods without their trials beginning.

Consequently, the committee thought it wise to create a management  tool  to
monitor this, not only  will  a  mechanism  of  this  nature  contribute  to
speedier trials - for the want of a better word - but it could even go  some
way in addressing our problems of prison overcrowding.

If this mechanism is perceived to be bending over  backwards  in  favour  of
accused persons only, let me dispel that perception. It  will  be  of  great
benefit to the criminal justice system ensuring that  criminal  trials  take
place as soon as possible after arrest, when  witnesses  are  available  and
when their memories are still fresh about the events. Ndo livhuwa. [I  thank
you.]

Ms C B JOHNSON: Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  before  I  start,  the  chairperson
referred to possible replacements, may I just  say  to  the  chair  that  we
definitely don't want to replace him. What  we  will  be  replacing  is  his
favourite green jersey with the hole in the elbow by buying him  a  new  one
for Christmas. [Laughter.]

The Bill before us aims to put together in one Bill a number  of  amendments
to various laws. The Bill in fact proposes amendments to a total of some  16
existing laws. There seems to be a perception that because Judicial  Matters
Amendment Bills, in  general,  are  seldom  overly  controversial  that  its
provisions are purely technical in nature or purely administrative.

But if one looks closely at this Bill it becomes clear that,  although  many
of the provisions are purely  technical,  there  are  also  many  provisions
which, once passed, will have a significant impact on the day to  day  lives
of people, and the way the public experience our  courts  and  the  criminal
justice system as a whole.

Dit is juis hierdie klousules wat 'n direkte invloed op mense se  lewe  gaan
hê, en waarby ek 'n oomblik wil stilstaan. Baie van  hierdie  klousules  sal
die hofproses aansienlik meer stroomlyn maak,  en  beter  dienslewering  aan
die publiek verseker. (Translation of Afrikaans paragraph follows.)

[It is on these very clauses, which will have a direct  impact  on  people's
lives, that I would like to pause for a moment. Many of these  clauses  will
streamline the  court  process  significantly,  and  ensure  better  service
delivery to the public.]

In this regard, I specifically wish to refer to the  clauses  which  extends
the current role of the family advocate. At  present,  the  family  advocate
makes recommendations to the court on any matter concerning the  welfare  of
children in divorce proceedings. The  amendment  proposed  will  extend  the
current function of the family advocate to maintenance  enquiries  as  well.
This will greatly assist complainants in maintenance matters.

Similarly, the amendment proposed  also  extends  the  role  of  the  Family
Advocate to domestic violence matters. This is absolutely  crucial,  because
it ensures greater assistance and greater protection to  victims  of  family
violence.

The Bill further amends both the Divorce Act  and  the  Maintenance  Act  to
allow a court, when granting a divorce, to make an order that any part of  a
pension interest which is due to  another  party  be  paid  to  such  party.
However, the clause which is, in the view of the New NP, the most  important
one is clause 6 of the Bill.

Clause 6 inserts a new provision  into  the  Criminal  Procedure  Act  which
provides that when a court sentences a person to  imprisonment  for  murder,
robbery, rape, armed robbery, sexual assault or kidnapping,  the  victim  of
the crime, or in the case of murder, a family member of the  victim  of  the
crime, has the right to appear before the parole board and will have  a  say
and will have the right to make  representations  before  the  parole  board
should parole be considered for a prisoner.

Die persepsie bestaan by die  publiek  dat  die  regte  van  slagoffers  van
geweld minder belangrik is as  die  regte  van  misdadigers,  en  daarom  is
hierdie klousule van wesenlike belang. (Translation of  Afrikaans  paragraph
follows.)

[The perception exists among the  public  that  the  rights  of  victims  of
violence are less important that the rights  of  criminals,  therefore  this
clause is of essential importance.]

It is important because this clause gives a voice to victims  of  crime.  It
gives a victim of crime the right to have a say and the right to  be  heard.
It gives a direct input  into  the  criminal  justice  system.  The  New  NP
believes that by inserting this clause, Government is showing that it  hears
of the voice for victims of  crime.  This  Bill  directly  affects  people's
lives and does what all legislation do, namely to make people  lives  better
by giving greater legal protection and improved access to justice.

Unlike the DA, the New NP does not think that  the  fair  administration  of
justice is merely a pipe dream. We believe it can be a reality.  Bills  like
these make the system better. Therefore, we support the Bill. [Applause.]

Mr S N SWART: Madam Deputy Speaker,  whilst  there  are  various  provisions
contained in the Bill - in fact all the provisions that  we  support  -  but
due to time constraints I will only focus on certain aspects thereof.

The  ACDP  firstly  supports  these  complex  provisions  relating  to   the
Amendments to Section 35b of  the  Insolvency  Act,  regulating  agreements,
providing for the termination of netting of certain unperformed  obligations
and obligations in respects of assets. It is a very complex set  of  clauses
which, after a while, we managed to get our mind  around  and  we  are  thus
fully supportive of that. We are  really  supportive  of  the  amendment  to
Section 60 of the  Criminal  Procedure  Act,  providing  for  the  pre-trial
services report that should be taken into account. During our visit  to  the
Port Elizabeth Courts, we found this very effective cutting down on  lengthy
bail hearings and allowing for courts to  get  on  with  the  true  criminal
trial matters.

The ACDP also  has  consistently  supported  a  victim-centered  restorative
justice approach. We  therefore  also  support  the  insertion  of  the  new
provision in the Criminal Procedure Act which imposes a duty on  our  courts
at sentencing  stage  to  inform  the  complainant  or  the  relative  of  a
complainant  in  serious  crime,  murder  cases  of  the   right   to   make
representations to a parole board,  when  the  parole  of  the  prisoner  is
considered. This we in the ACDP we believe is a very important  addition  to
involve victims of crime to a greater  degree  in  particularly  the  parole
process.

We also support the amendments to  provide  for  the  National  Director  of
Public Prosecutions to submit a report to Parliament  and  to  the  Minister
relating to those awaiting-trial prisoners in custody  whose  trial  has  no
yet commenced. I also sit on the Correctional Services  Portfolio  Committee
and we are all aware of the  great  difficulties  that  we  are  faced  with
awaiting-trial prisoners and we  trust  that  this  clause  will  assist  in
monitoring and reducing the number of  awaiting-trial  prisoners,  and  will
have a knock-on, positive effect on overcrowded conditions in prisons.

In conclusion, therefore, the ACDP will support this Bill.

Mr M T MASUTHA: Deputy Speaker,  hon  members,  before  I  proceed  with  my
speech let me  express  my  appreciation  to  the  DA  for  supporting  this
measure, which is aimed at bringing improvement into  our  criminal  justice
system. It is unfortunate, however, that they do not  demonstrate  the  same
measure of enthusiasm when it comes to social policies  that  are  aimed  at
improving the living conditions of the majority of  our  people,  especially
the poor. I think the outcome of the elections will demonstrate that.

The Bill before us, is one which in typical  Afrikaans  tradition  could  be
called a ``potjiekos'', because it contains a bit of everything  in  justice
legislation  that  needs  to  be  fixed  but  that  does  not  justify   the
introduction of a separate Bill to do so. In my input to this debate I  will
concentrate mainly on two areas, namely improvements on the law relating  to
the criminal procedure  and  re-enforcement  of  the  measures  designed  to
enhance access to information under the Promotion of Access  to  Information
Act.

Starting with the Criminal Procedure Act, allow me to  commence  by  stating
that as the law on bail which  is  contained  in  Section  60  of  that  Act
currently stands:


  an accused who is in detention is entitled to be released on bail at  any
  stage before his or her conviction, if the court  is  satisfied  that  to
  grant such bail will be in the interest of justice.

To establish this the court may require, as provided for under  the  section
I have just referred to, relevant  information  to  enable  it  to  make  an
appropriate order in this regard. The Bill before us seeks to amend  Section
60 by the addition of subsection 29(a) so as to  compel  the  courts  before
reaching a decision on any bail application to  take  a  pre-trial  services
report into account - if it is available - so as to ensure that  it  arrives
at the best possible decision in this regard.

As we all that know sentencing is not  merely  intended  as  punishment  for
offences committed. But even more importantly it is a tool  to  restore  the
imbalance that has occurred in society as a result of the commission  of  an
offence and serves as an opportunity to  rehabilitate  an  offender,  whilst
giving him  or  her  the  opportunity  to  improve  on  his  or  her  social
behaviour. In  this  context  correctional  supervisions  serve  in  certain
instances as the most appropriate sentence particularly with regard to  less
serious offences, provided for in the law as it currently stands.

Despite authoritative ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeal confirming  that
such sentencing is competent in the case of statutory offences and not  only
in common law offences. There has been mixed responses in  the  High  Courts
to this issue thus resulting in legal uncertainties. Some High  Courts  have
excluded correctional supervision as a competence sentencing  option,  where
the relevant  statute  that  establishes  the  offence  does  not  expressly
provide for such a sentencing option.

An amendment is therefore introduced under clause 5 of the Bill  before  us,
to remove this legal uncertainty by expressly providing for this  sentencing
option in respect of  all  of  offences,  except  in  the  case  of  serious
offences  where  the  provisions  regarding  minimum  sentences  under   the
Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1997 apply.

Clause 6 introduces a new measure into a Criminal  Procedure  Act  aimed  at
enhancing the rights of victims of serious offences in matters  relating  to
the early release of convicted offenders on parole. In  this  regard  a  new
duty is imposed on the courts during sentencing to  inform  the  complainant
or his or her relatives in the  case  of  offences  such  as  murder,  rape,
robbery or kidnapping of his or her  right  to  make  representations  to  a
parole board when the application for parole by the prisoner is considered.

Lastly in relation to the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Act, Clause  7
of the Bill is a response to the concern which Parliament has  expressed  on
numerous occasions regarding the long periods of detention  accused  persons
often experience, before their trial commences; due to  a  clogging  in  the
Criminal Justice System.

This clause requires  the  National  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions,  in
January and July annually, to submit a report to  the  Minister  of  Justice
who in turn must table such a report  in  Parliament.  Such  a  report  must
provide the particulars of awaiting-trial accused whose trials  has  no  yet
commenced; where such accused have been in custody for a  continuous  period
from the date of arrest of not more than 18, 12 and 6  months;  and  if  the
trial will take place in  the  High  Court,  regional  Court  or  magistrate
courts respectively. This measure will enable  Parliament  to  monitor  this
situation so as to assess whether any measures could be taken to improve  on
this.
Turning to the amendment to the Promotion to the Access to  Information  Act
of 2000, which  imposes  a  duty  of  providing  access  to  information  as
required by our Constitution, allow me to start  by  alluding  to  the  fact
that it is trite law that there is no offence without a legal provision  for
it: Nullum crimen sine  lege.  Nor  is  there  a  penalty  without  a  legal
sanction for it: Sine lege nulla poena.

It has been brought to the attention of the  committee  that  those  charged
with the responsibility of complying with the Act, that  is  the  Access  to
Information Act, often choose to blatantly ignore  their  obligations  under
the law. The Act as it stands does not impose any sanctions on  any  private
or public bodies for failing to produce a manual as required under the  Act,
which is necessary to assist those who wish to access information  in  terms
of that Act.

The Act is therefore being amended to provide that  an  information  officer
is guilty  of  an  offence  and  liable  on  conviction  to  a  fine  or  to
imprisonment for a maximum of two years, if he or she wailfully, or  through
gross negligence, fails to comply with the Act in  this  regard.  A  similar
sanction  is  imposed  on  a  head  of  a  private  body  who  is  similarly
responsible in the private sphere context. [Applause.]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson, this Bill serves to amend  a  variety  of  Bills
that are administered  by  the  Department  of  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development. The Minority Front has no objection to this and finds  it  much
rather accommodating in terms of time and instead of having to see to  these
straightforward changes individually.

With reference  to  the  amendments  made  in  this  Bill  to  the  Criminal
Procedure Act of 1997 the Minority Front feels that  the  compellation  upon
courts to view pre-trial services reports to assist the court's decision  on
releasing a person on bail would be beneficial and ensure fairness.  Further
amendments regarding the use of correctional  supervision  as  a  sentencing
option in respect of statutory offences is supported.

Over the years we have had many claims against attorneys as a direct  result
of a lack of management and administrative skills. The Minority Front  feels
that the proposed legal practice management course  would  certainly  assist
to deal with this but that it  should  not  only  be  incumbent  upon  newly
appointed attorneys but to all attorneys.

Amendments made in the light of divorcees and the  sharing  of  pension  and
interest accumulated on that interest is found to be fair and  supported  by
the Minority Front. Amendments made to accord the  Board  of  Sheriffs  with
its national status is well-deserved and should be speedily inculcated.

The extension of the role of the family advocates regarding maintenance  and
domestic violence is felt  to  be  beneficial  to  instituting  our  justice
system more effectively.

The  Minority  Front  is  especially  supportive  of  amendments   regarding
maintenance  and  action  taken  against  persons  failing  to  make   these
payments. No objection is given on the extension date for the South  African
Human  Rights  Commission  in  its  duties  regarding  the  translation   of
documents, pending circumstances but requests  that  these  be  done  in  an
effective timeframe.

Lastly amendments regarding the pensions of  judges  within  the  speculated
timeframe to  retired  judges  or  the  spouses  of  such  judges  is  found
reasonable and supported. The Minority Front support  the  Judicial  Matters
Second Amendment Bill.

The  MINISTER  FOR  JUSTICE  AND  CONSTITUTIONAL  DEVELOPMENT:  Chairperson,
thanks very much. I really am rising  to  thank  the  hon  members  for  the
support they have lent  to  this  Bill  which  have  been  adjudged  by  all
speakers and in turn by all of us to be a very  important  Bill.  So  thanks
very much hon members.

However, it becomes unavoidable to  respond  to  two  remarks  made  by  the
speaker on behalf of the DA, namely the hon Sheila Camerer. Firstly, I  just
want to state that, for the erudition  of  members,  the  training  that  is
given to judicial officers, as well as prosecutors, is not only longer  than
it was under apartheid, but it's also now much more  comprehensive  in  this
programme.  It  encompasses  a  whole  lot  of  very   interesting   things,
including, for instance, gender and race sensitivity.  So,  it's  much  more
comprehensive.

And secondly, the hon member refers to affirmative  action  appointments.  I
know of no affirmative action appointments in  my  four  and  a  half  years
experience as Minister responsible for the administration of justice. I  had
the pleasure of studying the reports  of  the  magistrate's  commission  and
their recommendations before making the appointment.  Essentially  it  is  a
formality.

It never occurred to me that there are some people who by  nature  of  their
race  or  gender,  or  both,  were  evidence  of  paced  affirmative  action
appointments. I am saying this, hon members, because  you  see  we  have  to
know the facts. No person, for instance, has been appointed as a  magistrate
in this country, at least not since I took over - I don't know about  during
the terms of previous Ministers, including my colleague Dullah  Omar  -  for
affirmative action reasons. They are all duly qualified. They have  all  the
necessary qualifications.

If you take for instance the regional court, there is not  a  single  person
who becomes a magistrate there without a LLB, and it's a South  African  LLB
that is available to all who want to take it, at  all  universities.  Black,
white, male and female take it.
Now  the  danger  in  this  sort  of  argument  that  we  are  making  hasty
affirmative action appointments is this one  that  you  see  hidden  in  the
averment is real and deeply embedded racism. That is the  problem.  What  if
indeed the weakness that you have identified, hon  member,  exhibits  itself
in a white  person  who  in  the  past  automatically  qualified  for  these
positions and therefore is not an element of hasty affirmative  action.  But
the same problem when it exhibits itself in a woman or  a  black,  or  both,
you say there you are, affirmative action is a problem.  Affirmative  action
is a matter of must in this country, unless of course we are  told  that  we
should not touch things. We should leave them as they are. For how long,  we
don't know. We  don't  make  any  affirmative  action  appointments  to  the
judiciary. We don't.

All the people who have been appointed to the judiciary  have  gone  through
the normal processes at being considered for appointment. We don't say  this
is a black and regardless of the fact that he  or  she  is  unqualified,  we
shall appoint them. We don't do that.  Precisely,  Chairperson,  because  we
bear in mind, at all times - I hope we all do it - the best interest of  the
judiciary and the best interest of this country. So it is completely  untrue
that we make any hasty affirmative action appointments. We don't.

We look at the person's suitability. No doubt of  course,  none  of  us  has
ever pretended to be anything near a god. We may make mistakes and  then  we
discover these mistakes after the person has been appointed.  And  it's  got
nothing to do with affirmative action.  Some  of  these  weaknesses  exhibit
themselves in squeaky white people. No affirmative action was applied  prior
to that at all if you follow the logic of the hon member. So, I want to  say
please, let us not seek to dress our deeply embedded racism in the  garb  of
affirmative action. I thank you. [Applause.]

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: That concludes the debate on  the  Bill.  Are
there any objections to the Bill being read a second  time?  No  objections.
Agreed to. The secretary will read the Bill a second time.

Bill read a second time.

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES:  The  Bill  will  be  sent  to  the  National
Council of Provinces for concurrence.
                      CRIMINAL PROCEDURE AMENDMENT BILL

                (Consideration of Bill and of Report thereon)

The CHAIRPERSON OF COMMITTEES: As there is no list of  speakers,  are  there
any objections to the Bill being agreed to? No objections.  Agreed  to.  The
Bill will be sent to the President for assent. The next  six  items  on  the
Order  Paper  are  requests  for  the  approval  by  Parliament  of  certain
international conventions and protocols in terms of section  231(2)  of  the
Constitution. By agreement the Orders will be debated together  and  at  the
end of the debate the House will consider each instrument separately.

  UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL ORGANISED CRIME PROTOCOL
           AGAINST THE SMUGGLING OF MIGRANTS BY LAND, SEA AND AIR
 PROTOCOL TO PREVENT, SUPPRESS AND PUNISH TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS, ESPECIALLY
                             WOMEN AND CHILDREN
 PROTOCOL AGAINST THE ILLICIT MANUFACTURING OF AND TRAFFICKING IN FIREARMS,
                  THEIR PARTS AND COMPONENTS AND AMMUNITION
     PROTOCOL ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) TRIBUNAL
  AGREEMENT AMENDING THE PROTOCOL ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY
                               (SADC) TRIBUNAL

Mr G SOLOMON: Chairperson, the Protocol  to  Prevent,  Suppress  and  Punish
Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children; the Protocol  against
the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air and the Protocol against  the
Illicit Manufacturing of  and  Trafficking  in  Firearms,  their  Parts  and
Components and Ammunition are supplements to the United  Nations  Convention
against Transnational Organised Crime.  Transnational  organised  crime  and
its  increase  are  of  serious  concern,  not  only  to  the  international
community as a whole, but to South Africa in particular.

In a way the increase of transnational  crime  is  an  inevitable  curse  of
economic globalisation. It seems that it is related to the proliferation  of
free trade agreements and free trade zones in the  world  resulting  in  the
great rise in the transnational flow of goods and  services  throughout  the
globe. There was a greater chance  then  for  grey,  illegal  or  contraband
goods to slip through. When there  is  an  enormous  increase  in  passenger
volume on international commercial flights, there is  a  greater  chance  of
persons of ill-intent to slip into countries. Major currencies, such as  the
dollar, Deutschmark and yen are nearly universally  exchangeable,  smoothing
the transition from illicit profit in one part of the  world  to  apparently
legitimate investment elsewhere in a different currency. The easy, fast  and
efficient electronic money transfers daily  also  contribute  enormously  to
transnational crime. It  is  estimated  that  in  one  New  York-based  bank
network alone, more than US$ 2 billion race through  digital  channels  each
minute.

Experts estimate that half of the  industrialised  world's  stock  of  money
resides in or passes through tax havens. Increasing  illegal  migration  and
the hostility and economic  hardships  which  migrants  often  face  in  new
homelands create fertile grounds  for  cohesive,  hard  to  penetrate  crime
networks spanning many borders.  Indeed  transnational  organised  crime  is
certainly a serious concern. It is underpinned by the profits  of  the  drug
trade, trafficking in women and children and illicit  arms  and  ammunition.
Organised  crime  generates  enormous  financial  profits  thereby  enabling
criminal organisations to penetrate, contaminate or corrupt  the  structures
of legitimate commercial and financial business as  well  as  structures  of
government.

Indeed, the most serious effects of all  this  is  the  destruction  of  the
social fabric of communities leaving families and particularly  children  at
the mercy of criminals. South  Africa  not  only  has  a  duty  towards  the
international community, but also towards SADC and the AU in order  to  stem
the tide of transnational organised  crime  by  acceding  to  the  measures,
protocols and international agreements.

The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development was represented  at
all the meetings regarding the drafting of the convention and the  protocols
and played a major role where money laundering issues were concerned.

The Protocol  against  the  Illicit  Manufacturing  of  and  Trafficking  in
Firearms, their Parts and Components and  Ammunition  was  signed  by  South
Africa on 14 October 2002.
On 14 December 2002 the Republic of South Africa signed the  United  Nations
Convention  against  Transnational  Organised  Crime  and  the  Protocol  to
Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,  especially  Women  and
Children and the Protocol against the Smuggling of  Migrants  by  Land,  Sea
and Air.

The  convention  established  four  specific   crimes.   Article   5   makes
participating in organised criminal  groups  a  specific  crime.  Article  6
deals with money laundering. Article 8 deals  with  corruption.  Article  23
deals with obstruction of justice.

How ready is South Africa for this? A number of  pieces  of  legislation  in
South Africa do conform to the protocols in this convention. The  Prevention
of  Organised  Crime  Act  of  1998  criminalises  organised  crime,   money
laundering  and  criminal  gang  activities.  It  also  provides   for   the
confiscation of proceeds of crime.

The Financial Intelligence Centre  Act  of  2001  aims  at  combating  money
laundering, in particular the reporting of suspicious transactions.

The Corruption Act of 1992, the Public Protector Act of 1994 and the  Public
Finance Management Act of 1999  deal  with  corruption,  especially  in  the
public sector. The Bill presently before the committee,  the  Prevention  of
Corruption Bill, deals comprehensively with crimes of corruption.

As far as the protocols are concerned: Article 5 of protocol 1,  trafficking
in persons, especially  women  and  children,  criminalises  trafficking  in
persons. Currently South Africa has no specific legislation  to  cover  this
crime.

Article 6 of the protocol on the smuggling  of  migrants  criminalises  this
activity. There  is  currently  no  specific  legislation.  The  responsible
departments are Home Affairs, Transport, Safety and Security.

The protocol on illicit firearms  -  South  Africa  is  compliant  with  the
protocol.

What are the implications for South Africa regarding these  conventions  and
protocols? There are no constitutional implications.  The  Chief  State  Law
Adviser has advised that there appears to be no conflict  with  domestic  or
international law.

There are also  no  organisational  and  personal  implications,  since  the
interdepartmental committee has a mandate to facilitate the ratification  of
conventions and protocols and to develop legislation.

There are some financial implications. The costing of new  legislation  will
be done by the relevant departments.

In  conclusion,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, having considered the request for  approval  by  Parliament  of
the United Nations Convention against transnational organised crime and  the
three supplementing protocols referred to  it,  recommends  that  the  House
approves the Convention and supplementary  protocols  in  terms  of  section
231(2) of the Constitution with reservation.

The Republic of South Africa does not recognise the compulsory  jurisdiction
of the  International  Criminal  Court  of  Justice.  Therefore,  pending  a
decision by the Government on the  matter,  the  committee  also  recommends
that  the  Republic  does  not  consider  itself  bound  by  those  articles
pertaining to compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of  Justice
in the convention and the respective protocols.

The Protocol on the Southern African Development Community Tribunal and  the
Agreement  amending  the  Protocol  on  the  Southern  African   Development
Community Tribunal must be seen in  the  context  of  the  ANC  Government's
policy and programme towards building a stable, secure and  viable  Southern
African  Development  Community  linked  to  the  African  Union   and   its
socioeconomic  programme   Nepad,   the   New   Partnership   for   Africa's
Development.

The  process  of  building  a  regionally  secure  and  economically  viable
community in Southern Africa is of profound interest and importance  to  the
ANC. It requires  encouraging  processes  that  can  overcome  some  of  the
constraints  such  as  power  instability,  military  conflicts,   political
fragmentation and economic imbalances. Some of the challenges are  presently
successfully negotiated and resolved by the ANC Government.

Now for the protocols before us. The treaty  governing  the  SADC  agreement
that regulates it, establishes a number of supranational  institutions  such
as the Summit  of  Heads  of  States,  the  Council  of  Ministers,  special
commissions, standing committees. The  Secretariat  and,  as  far  as  these
protocols are concerned, Article 9 establishes a  tribunal  related  to  its
activity and settle disputes between members and member states.

The protocol, which constitutes the tribunal, was signed by the  SADC  heads
of state, including South Africa, at their summit in Windhoek,  Namibia,  on
7 August 2000. The tribunal shall consist of not less than  10  members  who
possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest  judicial
offices in their respective  states,  and  who  are  jurists  of  recognised
competence. Articles 3 to 9 deal with the  nomination,  appointment,  tenure
of office and other related matters pertaining to these persons.

Articles 10 to 15 deal with the seat of the tribunal and  its  jurisdiction.
Article 16(1) deals with the function of the tribunal  to  ensure  adherence
to the SADC treaty and subsidiary instruments, and to adjudicate  upon  such
disputes as may be referred to it. So, you should  now  have  some  idea  of
what this is all  about;  what  we  have  to  approve  today.  Firstly,  the
Protocol on the Tribunal in  the  Southern  African  Development  Community;
secondly, the agreement  amending  the  Protocol  on  the  Tribunal  in  the
Southern African Development Community.

The amendments in the agreement are of a technical nature, mainly to  delete
the words ``states'' and ``state'' in a number  of  articles  and  replacing
them  with  ``member  states''  and  ``member  state''   respectively.   The
amendments were agreed upon and duly witnessed and signed by  the  heads  of
state and authorised government designates, including  our  President  Thabo
Mbeki, at Luanda on 3 October 2003.

What about the implications for South Africa?  Constitutional  implications?
None. The state law advisers indicated that no provision of the protocol  is
in conflict with the domestic law of  South  Africa  and  international  law
respectively. Personal implications? Yes. South African judges who  wish  to
serve on the tribunal full-time have to  vacate  their  offices.  Therefore,
the implication  would  be  the  replacement  of  such  judges  or  judicial
officers. Financial implications? None. The tribunal  will  be  funded  from
the regular budget of the SADC community.

In  conclusion,  the  Portfolio  Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional
Development, having considered the request for  approval  by  Parliament  of
the Protocol on the Tribunal in the Southern African  Development  Community
and the agreement amending the Protocol on  the  Tribunal  in  the  Southern
African Development Community referred to it, recommends that the House,  in
terms of section 231(1) of the Constitution,  approve  the  said  protocols.
Thank you, Chairperson.

Mrs S M  CAMERER:  Chairperson,  the  DA  has  pleasure  in  supporting  the
ratification by South Africa of  the  UN  Convention  against  Transnational
Organised Crime, subject to the reservation, and the  various  supplementary
protocols listed on the Order Paper. But we particularly wish  to  highlight
our support for the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking  in
Persons, Especially Women and Children.

The purpose of the protocol is defined in its title, but  it  also  aims  to
assist victims of such trafficking. The most important provision is  article
5 which requires state parties to adopt such legislative and other  measures
as may be necessary to establish such trafficking as a criminal offence,  or
offences, in the country concerned.

At present these offences do not exist per se in our law. The South  African
Police Services has for some time indicated that in order to assist them  in
combating trafficking in women and children successfully, there needs to  be
a specific criminal offence in our law.

And it was for this reason that  I  put  forward  in  April,  as  a  Private
Members'  Bill,  an  amendment  to  the  Child  Care  Act,  to   criminalise
trafficking in children.

We in the DA believe that we should at the very  least  do  something  about
the most vulnerable members of our  society.  In  motivating  that  Bill  to
Madam Speaker, I argued that trafficking  in  human  beings  for  sexual  or
other exploitation is an abhorrent modern  day  form  of  slavery  and  that
there is ample evidence that this phenomenon is one of the  fastest  growing
areas of international criminal activity.

Those trafficked are mostly women and children. Research  conducted  by  the
United Nations, Molo Songololo and other bodies, indicates that  trafficking
in women and children for sexual and other purposes, is on the  increase  in
South Africa.

Furthermore,  the  country   is   increasingly   becoming   an   established
destination and transit point for international  trafficking  in  women  and
children. Evidence that this trade is  often  linked  to  illegal  trade  in
drugs and weapons, is there.

Children in South Africa have the  constitutional  guaranteed  right  to  be
protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation.  And  Parliament
has the  obligation,  rooted  in  the  Constitution,  to  adopt  legislative
measures to protect  that  right.  Existing  legislation  does  not  provide
children with adequate protection against the evil of  trafficking  and,  in
fact, does not specifically prohibit trafficking.

The  South  African  Law  Commission  recently  looked  at  the  problem  of
trafficking and in its Discussion Paper 103 on the Review of the Child  Care
Act Project, it recommended that  a  provision  prohibiting  trafficking  of
children be included in the new comprehensive children statute.

Now, the new Children's Bill has just been tabled  in  Parliament.  However,
in the absence of it at the time,  I  proposed  this  legislative  provision
that in the meantime the  Child  Care  Act  be  amended  for  the  necessary
protection to children.

I am glad  to  say  that  the  Committee  on  Private  Members'  Legislative
Proposals agreed that an amendment to  the  law  to  outlaw  trafficking  in
children was desirable, but also suggested that  the  protection  should  be
extended to women, with which I heartily agreed.

When the Sexual  Offences  Bill  came  before  the  Portfolio  Committee  on
Justice shortly afterwards, I  suggested,  in  the  course  of  the  initial
briefings, that this would be an appropriate legislative vehicle to  include
a provision specifically outlawing and criminalising  trafficking  in  women
and children for sexual exploitation. While  the  chair  of  the  committee,
Johnny de Lange, agreed in principle, for  which  I  thank  him,  that  this
should be considered, no draft provision has of yet been  submitted  to  the
committee. However, I trust that it will soon be.

The Sexual Offences Bill would appear to be  the  appropriate  vehicle  with
which to comply with our international obligations under this protocol.

Accordingly, on behalf of the DA, I would  like  to  urge  the  Minister  of
Justice and the Chair  of  the  Justice  Portfolio  Committee  and  the  ANC
justice study group to  ensure  that  a  specific  provision,  criminalising
trafficking in women and children for  sexual  and  other  exploitation,  be
included in the Sexual Offences Bill, and that we pass  the  Bill  with  the
minimum of delay. We need to give notice to  human  traffickers  that  their
game is up. Thank you, Chair.

Mr T E VEZI: Chairperson, I will  try  to  be  as  brief  as  possible.  The
purpose of the convention is to promote co-operation,  and  to  prevent  and
combat  transnational  organised  crime  more  effectively.  The  convention
establishes as offence four specific crimes,  namely  the  participation  in
organised criminal groups, money-laundering, corruption and the  obstruction
of justice. Article 5 requires state  parties  to  enact  legislation  which
makes these activities domestic offences, if they are not already  offences.


The Portfolio Committee on Justice and  Constitutional  Development,  having
considered the request for approval by  Parliament  regarding  the  protocol
against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air, recommends that  the
House approves  the  said  protocol  in  terms  of  section  231(2)  of  the
Constitution, and approves that the Director-General of  the  Department  of
Transport be designated as an authority to receive and respond  to  requests
for  assistance.  The  director-general  will  be  complemented  by  the  SA
Maritime Safety Authority, the Department of Home Affairs, SAPS  and  SANDF.
If evidence of  smuggling  is  found,  the  flag  state  may  authorise  the
requesting state to board and search a vessel.
The  portfolio  committee  also  considered  the  request  for  approval  by
Parliament of the protocol to prevent, suppress and  punish  trafficking  in
persons, especially women and children. In line with the previous  position,
when ratifying United Nations multilateral treaties the  Republic  of  South
Africa  enters  reservation  against  the  compulsory  jurisdiction  of  the
International Court of Justice.

The protocol makes provision for the protection and assistance  of  victims.
The state should co-operate to the fullest extent to  prevent  and  suppress
smuggling of persons. Regarding provision for the protection and  assistance
of such victims, migrants shall not become liable for  criminal  prosecution
if they adhere to the principles of this Act.

On the  Protocol  against  the  Illicit  Manufacturing  and  Trafficking  in
Firearms, their Parts  and  Components  and  Ammunition,  supplementing  the
United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime,  article  7
states that states parties shall ensure maintenance for  not  less  than  10
years of information in relation to firearms, where feasible,  their  parts,
components and ammunition. Article 10 requires a state  party  to  establish
and maintain an  effective  system  of  export  and  import  licensing.  The
National Commissioner for the SAPS is identified as the point of contact  in
terms of article 13.

The Portfolio Committee  on  Justice  and  Constitutional  Development  also
considered the request for approval by Parliament of the agreement  amending
the  protocol  and  the  tribunal  in  the  Southern   African   Development
Community. Without boring the House with further ado, the IFP supports  this
protocol. Thank you.

Ms C JOHNSON: Chairperson, the New NP supports the request for  approval  by
Parliament of the United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organised
Crime, as well as the  three  protocols  flowing  therefrom,  save  for  the
reservations pertaining to the issue of  compulsory  jurisdiction.  It  also
supports the  approval  of  the  protocol  on  the  SADC  tribunal  and  the
agreement thereto.

The purpose of the UN convention is to promote  co-operation  between  state
parties  in  order  to  prevent  and   combat   transnational   crime   more
efficiently. The first two protocols to  the  UN  convention  are  aimed  at
preventing and combating trafficking  in  women  and  children  as  well  as
preventing the smuggling of migrants. It is  on  these  two  protocols  that
supplement the convention that we wish to focus.

With regard to the trafficking of women and  children,  reports  by  the  SA
Police Service have shown that there is an increasing number  of  women  and
children being brought to South Africa, particularly from Asia  and  Eastern
Europe. Many of these women are the victims of  trafficking  and  commercial
sexual exploitation.

Recent reports by the SA police indicate that there may be  as  many  as  38
000 cases of child prostitution annually,  and  there  is  further  evidence
that trafficking is one  of  the  fastest  growing  areas  of  international
criminal activity.

Research done by NGOs shows that trafficking in children in South Africa  is
increasing annually. There are  warnings  that  child  trafficking  has,  in
fact, become the third largest profit-making criminal enterprise after  drug
and gunrunning. It earns billions of dollars every year and the  problem  is
further exacerbated by high levels of poverty.

Research done in March this  year  found  that  South  Africa  is  the  main
destination for sex trade in the region, with both local and organised,  and
internationally organised crime groups involved. Those trafficked  to  South
Africa are mainly from Lesotho,  Mozambique,  Malawi,  Thailand,  China  and
Eastern Europe.

The  study  which  was  conducted  by  the  International  Organisation  for
Migration between August 2002 and February  2003  found  that  international
trafficking, especially for sex workers, is much more pervasive in  Southern
Africa than was initially thought. The report held, and I quote:


  Assistance to these  victims  is  desperately  needed,  as  well  as  the
  awareness and training of officials to deal with this crime.

It continues to say, and I quote:


  ... legislation in the region generally fails to criminalise  trafficking
  or to adequately protect  victims  and  calls  for  the  ratification  of
  international conventions that mandate governments to take  urgent  steps
  to curb the trade.

The New NP, therefore, believes that the approval  of  these  protocols  and
the UN convention from which they flow will curb  the  trade  and  are  thus
imperative. Thank you.

Mr S N SWART: Chairman, the ACDP supports all measures in the fight  against
the scourge of crime - particularly  of  a  transnational  organised  nature
and,  therefore,  supports  the  ratification  of  this  UN  convention  and
protocols.

In the limited time available, I would like to  focus  on  article  25  that
requires states parties to take appropriate measures within their  means  to
provide assistance and protection to victims covered by the convention.  The
paragraph states that parties should establish procedures to provide  access
to compensation and restitution for victims  of  offences  covered  by  this
convention.

Opinions were sought regarding the  financial  implications  in  respect  of
this article. The state law adviser  advised  that  the  provisions  do  not
envisage that state parties must establish a compensation fund for  victims.
The ACDP supports, as I mentioned  in  the  earlier  debate,  a  restorative
justice approach whereby victims of crime are compensated,  particularly  in
the case of property crimes. We, therefore, welcome  the  signing  of  these
protocols. But, we would like to see the establishment of a  crime  victims'
fund, particularly for those cases where the  criminal  is  unable  to  make
restitution to the victim. I thank you.

Ms S RAJBALLY: Chairperson ...

Hon MEMBERS: Malibongwe! [Praise!]

Ms S RAJBALLY: Igama lamakhosikazi! [The name of the women!]

Chairperson, I think that these international protocols and  agreements  are
long overdue. Arising from the protocols that are on  the  list,  you  could
see how important they are.

The United Nations Convention against  Transnational  Organised  Crime  will
assist us domestically as well  as  build  greater  global  relations  as  a
united force. Agreement on the measures to fight the smuggling  of  migrants
is also supported and found necessary. The  protocol  to  prevent,  suppress
and  punish  trafficking  in  persons,  especially  women  and  children  is
earnestly approved in order to denounce this human abuse and preserve  human
rights.

Further, the protocol against the illicit manufacturing of  and  trafficking
of firearms and associated gadgets is welcomed for it  fulfils  a  desperate
need. If we can get a greater hold on this market  we  may  actively  reduce
the killings and violence that these industries survive on.

Lastly, the protocol on SADC and amendments to it are supported  by  the  MF
in the hope that it will bring benefits to our state and  the  wellbeing  of
our citizenry. The MF supports these international  agreements.  Thank  you.
[Applause.]

          CONSIDERATION OF SECOND REPORT OF JOINT BUDGET COMMITTEE

Mr N M NENE: Mr Chairperson, this is the second report of the  Joint  Budget
Committee since it was established in October last year. Our mandate  is  to
monitor monthly expenditure reports by national  departments  and  reporting
to Parliament quarterly as we hereby do.

This report analyses the expenditure trends of  the  first  quarter  of  the
2003-04 financial year. In our first report, we drew the attention  of  this
House to a number of issues that required this  Parliament  to  take  action
on.  This  was  reflected  in  our  recommendations  and   some   of   those
recommendations  are  repeated  in  this  report  as   we   table   it   for
consideration and adoption today.

This is the  first  quarter  report  for  this  financial  year  and  it  is
characterised by expenditure trends that reflect transfers of  disbursements
to institutions that fall under the respective departments.  The  Department
of Education is one example that has to disburse in excess  of  50%  of  its
budget by the end of June 2003 to institutions of higher learning.

The Department of Social Development also disbursed the first  part  of  the
extension  of  the  child  support  grant  in  April,  resulting   in   high
expenditure during that month.

In general, the total departmental expenditure reflected a  gradual  decline
from April to June 2003. Eleven departments  have  consistently  spent  less
than the monthly average throughout  the  quarter,  monthly  averages  being
9,84% in April, 7,80% in May and 6,75% in June.

The Department of Foreign Affairs  and  the  Department  of  Communications,
according to the report, are the lowest-spending departments  at  less  than
3% of their budgets during the period under review. The reason given by  the
Department of Foreign Affairs for this low expenditure is that the  bulk  of
its department's expenditure takes place abroad, and therefore, there  is  a
time lag of two to three months before the financial reporting. Part of  the
problem is also attributed  to  the  problems  encountered  with  the  basic
accounting systems.

The main purpose of this exercise is to hold the  departments  and  the  the
executive to account. The departments  must  account  for  outputs  and  the
executive for the outcomes.

In our recommendations, the call for collaboration between the Joint  Budget
Committee with  sector  committees  in  interrogating  the  nature  and  the
quality of expenditure is repeated in this report.  Even  though  the  Joint
Budget Committee is concerned with the expenditure, we still  focus  on  the
quality of that spending.

The ANC's commitment to a better life for all is demonstrated  by  the  type
of mechanisms and policies that have been put in place at all levels.

Allow me, Chairperson, to remind MPs across the political spectrum of  their
responsibility of oversight and ensuring accountability in all departments.

The Public Finance Management Act places a responsibility on departments  to
report monthly and annually and  to  set  measurable  objectives  when  they
table their budgets. These should also be mirrored in their strategic  plans
during the planning stage.

In order to compare monthly planned expenditure to actual  expenditure,  the
Joint Budget Committee is in the process of obtaining cash  flow  statements
from departments and some departments have already responded positively.

I invite members to take some time to go  through  the  appendixes  in  this
report and to use these as a basis for  engaging  with  departments  in  the
respective portfolio committees in order to evaluate the quality of  service
delivery.

I present this report to this House and  trust  that  its  adoption  further
affirms our commitment to a better life for  all  South  Africans.  I  thank
you, Chairperson. [Applause.]

Ms E THABETHE: Chairperson, finally, on behalf of  the  Chief  Whip  of  the
Majority Party, I would like to move for the adoption of this report.

Motion agreed to.

Report accordingly adopted.

The House adjourned at 17:28.
